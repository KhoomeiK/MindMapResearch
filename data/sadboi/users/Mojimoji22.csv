OpenChristian,fpo1ybx,t3_gebd6z,1588776912.0,"I believe the Jews didn‚Äôt borrow the flood myth from the Babylonians and actually made that same story independently because a flood actually happened. Archaeologists hypothesize the flood story which is common to many religions is based on an actual cataclysmic flood in the Black Sea at c. 5500 BC. The sea level rose in the Mediterranean, and it burst and overflowed into the Black Sea. Underwater remains of villages that were completely submerged have been found recently in the Black Sea. Now I don‚Äôt believe Noah made an Ark and all that, but the flood is likely based on a real event.

titanfolk,fn4mg9z,t1_fn3tznf,1586644411.0,"The counter-point the video makes is that Eren does actually have other options. Go to 14:10. Gabi is the prime example of how an anti-Paradisian extremist can change their mindset. If more people can be like Gabi and change their minds due to Paradisians like our SC avengers and other peaceful Paradisians, Paradis does have a future in world peace. Besides, the whole world is gonna be thirsty for the ice burst crystals to make airplane technology, which gives Paradis leverage.

I like Eren a lot and hope he actually started the rumbling to make the SC and Marleyans come together to stop the rumbling. The avengers would become an example to the world of how peace should be established. Maybe he had already planned to stop the rumbling knowing that the avengers would come convince him to stop. When he hugged Ymir, it‚Äôs possible he saw the future and how avengers would establish peace in the face of a common enemy, so he ultimately decided to become the villain. Remember when Daz unknowingly dismantled the detonator instead of making it? I think there‚Äôs more to that instead of him just being a complete dumbass. It‚Äôs possible Eren controlled Daz to do that so the avengers can win that battle with the Yeagerists and fly to him. In this convoluted scenario, Eren put his money on a proper compromise between Paradis and the world, so he can still end all titan power and release Ymir from her slavery."
