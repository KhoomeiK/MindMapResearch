schizophrenia,fr3bbom,t3_gmds0z,1589853747.0,"I can't help but feel that way quite frequently. My time in the hospital was very conflicting, I started on medication that is kept me doing alright and actually learned some good things to keep me stable. I understand that staff had to keep themselves safe, but it still made me feel horrible. The physical barriers, the staff got noticeably uncomfortable if I got nothing 10 or so feet. I've kept my time away from work as in the dark as I can. The blue collar environment is particularly cruel on that front. I worked with someone there who was bipolar and everyone treated him like Boo Radley.

A bit more on topic, I am sickened by how schizophrenia and psychosis is viewed by the public. Depressed people often are given trite support (sometimes genuine), People with eating disorders are looked upon with pity, but us? I suppose you know the answer to that. I want to be open, I want to have safety nets, but just getting people to put down their fears is so hard."
schizophrenia,fqnk2ff,t3_gjwo89,1589496260.0,"I guess I'll offer some context. I drew this almost a year ago before I even received any sort of diagnosis. I just drew how I felt and what I saw. Eventually, I got treatment, got on medication and didn't draw since. I ran out of medication about a month ago and only told my therapist today. I felt fine for a few weeks, but I've been hallucinating again. I suppose I am putting this here as a reminder I cant let things get that bad again. Please get help if you suspect something is wrong. Please don't stop taking your meds. Please stay safe."

After Chester's death, I want back and listened to their entire library and there was so much that became reframed for me. They may not have the best melodies or the deepest lyrics, but they allowed people like me to vent and know we weren't alone. I may loathe their last album, but I still respect it for doing for others what their old stuff did for me."
