 ""2 couples, a female acquaintance of ours and one of his friends"". 

So it bothers you there were other woman there instead of being just men?

I can see why this bothers you, if he has been honest, but prehaps he didn't think about it until further down the line, or and i don't mean to be blunt here. 

Many of my friends are step parents, and since your boyfriend has been living with you for a year and a half, he's naturally taken on the ""parenting role"" there, prehaps the reason he didn't ask you or mention it, is that he needed a night off. 

I know it sounds harsh but you said it yourself  ""We rarely get babysitters at all as it's just my family and my daughter is one of my parents 9 grandchildren""

Which means in turn, neither of you go out that much together, and prehaps he just felt, and trying not to be insensitive to you, but prehaps he just needed a night out, without you. 

Which everyone does, the amount of time i've been on a guys night out with my own friends, but my boyfriend (well ex) isn't there as i just need a night without him 

I think looking over this, you said yourself, that you don't have many friends and don't go out that much, when you can try to get out there more.

if op want to be an asshole fine, but he has to live with the decision. the fact he went on reddit to ask the question, and everyone called him an asshole, even i called him an asshole. his own wife called him an asshole. may make him finally reaslie that he is. in fact an asshole who treats adopted kids like shit, because he's a greedy bastard who wants the money to go to his own children because they carry his dna"

your husband of 13 years was jealous, that a man in his 80's paid you a compliment, knew about your country of origin, called you beautiful your family. and your husband instead of being complimented, because he was the lucky one who married you. and your husband felt ignored.

&#x200B;

was a  man in his 80's meant to pay your husband a compliment too, to make him feel better?

no your not the asshole. in fact and i know he's your husband. but he's acting like one."
AmItheAsshole,fhwc9ah,t1_fhwbr73,1581911912.0,"oh don't get me wrong, i think he's a total prick. but at least it's a compromise. end of the day, he has to live with the decision that he alone thinks of his sisters children as lesser when they are adopted. but we all know he wouldn't be feeling the same way if it was his own children who were adopted. 

but he has to live with that decision, i know i could never do it."

I know this too well. most of my birthdays have been crushing disappoitments, not because i don't tell people. i do, but they ignore it. last one was my 40th and instead of going paintballing. my sisters arranged bottemless prosecco, and drag queens. 

I hate prosecco and there is nothing worse, then my bisexual ass, in some seedy bar watching a good drag show, with a bunch of hetro's who know nothing of the history of drag. and why i respect it, but didn't want it. 

my sisters didn't care, and it was a ""surprise"". 

by asking her, you do. you actually care."
