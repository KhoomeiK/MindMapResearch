You can really only choose one of these two takes though. A political thriller with shitty dialogue is just... Not a good political thriller, to be frank. 

As someone who loves the prequels I empathize with your argument. But this assertion that the movies are thought-provoking and people don't like them because they don't ""get them"" and just want dumb action really doesn't hold up for multitude of reasons. The prequels blatantly state every theme and message they're trying to convey via sloppy dialogue in a borderline Wisseau-esque fashion (""from my point of view, the Jedi are evil!""). If it weren't for the gigantic pile of supplementary shows, comics, etc. created by other people that better expand on the prequels' concepts, there would be no reason to think there's anything below the surface in those movies.

People don't think the prequels are boring because they're too intellectual or restrained. They're boring because the slow moments are about as deep as a kiddie pool and the action is distractingly artificial, leaving almost nothing interesting about them except for the aesthetics and the desire for what COULD have been (which we eventually got with later content).

I love the prequels for nostalgic reasons, their genuinely great production design, and their interesting concepts. But those alone don't do enough for me to consider them good movies in good faith."

I'm fully aware that there were subtle hints that Yondu didn't hate Peter, but that's kinda the problem. It should've been more than that. Treating Yondu's father-like role in Peter's life as some kind of ""reveal"" was an inherent mistake for the type of story they were telling. It muddled and rushed the ""your father ain't your daddy"" message because the audience has to simultaneously process the fact that Yondu ever had **any** kind of positive influence on Peter in the first place, much less enough for us to accept him as ""the good dad"" compared to Ego. 

At the end of the day Yondu was still a kidnapping, abusive piece of shit and about as much of a negative force in Peter's story as Ego was. And the worst part is that he never really seems to take accountability for those mistakes in his arc (which *might* have made the whole arc work). A flashback of him teaching little Peter to bowhunt or whatever doesn't justify the message that the movie was trying to send there.

If the story had just portrayed their relationship in a more complex and transparent way from the beginning, Yondu's sacrifice would have felt so much more emotionally impactful. They could've done that without compromising his role as an adversary to Peter in the first movie.

As someone who is much closer to my step-dad than my biological dad, the climax of the movie should have *easily* had me bawling my eyes out. Instead I was just scratching my head. I am usually a huge sucker for these types of stories but this one just didn't work at all for me."
marvelstudios,fpk3jyh,t1_fpjj9fg,1588687273.0,"> Peter double-crossed Yondu several times, yet Yondu didn't punish him.

The one time he had a chance to ""punish him"" was when he captured Quill outside of Knowhere, and his decision to let him off definitely wasn't an act of goodwill at all... Quill had tons of leverage in that confrontation (the knowledge and willingness to retrieve the orb and Drax pointing a gigantic weapon at Yondu's ship).

I'll also add that Yondu ""not punishing"" Quill is a very weak case for them having a caring relationship, in the first place. Especially since we aren't really given much of a baseline for how Yondu treats the rest of his crew compared to Quill.

> At the end when Peter substitued the Power Stone for a troll doll, Yondu smiled fondly when he found out.

This, in my opinion, is the only case anyone can make that Yondu's father figure role had any kind of setup before the flashbacks in GotG2. But even then, I think it's a HUGE stretch to say that this informed the audience of anything resembling a caring relationship. At the time it felt much more like a demonstration of his newfound respect for Quill, paired with a callback to the running joke that Yondu loves dolls (possibly so much so that he was just as satisfied receiving that in place of the orb). That scene was not difficult for me to interpret at the time, even as someone who was totally oblivious to father/son thing that James Gunn was supposedly going for.

But regardless of what that scene communicated or its intention, the father/son dynamic still wasn't really developed at all in Guardians 2 until just moments before his death (in the most direct and unimaginative way possible by showing flashbacks). So that moment alone was basically carrying the entire arc on its shoulders across both movies... And that's just not enough to justify the drastic pivot for Yondu's role at the very end of GotG2."

GotG2 as a whole had this problem everywhere. Every ""theme"" in that movie is pretty much opened and shut in a single conversation.

Everyone in the world makes good and bad decisions. I am almost certain that the coffee I drink is the result of an incredibly unethical production, and I just haven't done the due diligence to find a more ethical product.

I can empathize with Mr. Blue Collar's decision to buy the carnitas *and* disapprove of it. That doesn't mean I can't think he is still a great person who deserves to have the simple pleasure in life that the carnitas gives him. For all I know, he is completely ignorant to how much suffering went into that meal. In which case I couldn't blame the guy for carrying on without thinking about it.

But with all of this said, that doesn't make the carnitas any less unethical, nor does it mean he isn't contributing to unnecessary suffering. At the end of the day, buying the carnitas is still wrong, just like buying child porn is wrong regardless of how hard your life is or how good you are in every other facet of life. All I can do is hope that the pleasure he gets from carnitas will be substituted with something else that doesn't involve a victim, and maybe help him find that substitution.

I don't believe that pitbulls are inherently worse dogs or that we should be banning pitbulls from our various facilities, but I do think that we should stop deliberately creating them (along with all other breeds) for reasons beyond the possibility that they are more or less inherently dangerous than other dogs.

We can argue all day long about the existence of reputable breeders, but nonreputable breeders will always be the majority and homeless dogs will continue to suffer in the millions as long as any old Joe schmoe can buy a pet from a breeder for no reason other than hand-pick a very specific aesthetic and personality for their dog."

I'm not an expert on this issue so I can't say what method would work best, but I'm sure there has to be some way to make breeding a government service that exclusively serves law enforcement, healthcare, etc. so that it can actually be monitored closely and only serve those who **truly** need specific breeds."

Edit 2: All of you throwing arguments at me about police/service dogs... There is a valid argument to be made about this being an exception to an anti-breeding stance, but that still doesn't let you or anyone else off the hook for going to a breeder for your **pet**. There are far better ways we can fill the roles in society than to let millions upon millions of animals be used for profit at the expense of millions *more* animals who will never live happy or comfortable lives as a result.

Another useful piece of advice: despite how ridiculously specific and unnecessary some subgenres are, it actually really comes in handy to learn about them for this reason. 

Take Killswitch Engage for example - in many cases you'll see old-school metalcore bands like Earth Crisis, or maybe those cringey early 00's emo metalcore bands like Attack Attack lumped into the same category as Killswitch... But obviously those three bands don't have anything in common aesthetically. However, if you look into the more specific subgenre of *melodic* metalcore, you'll narrow your search down to bands that generally sound pretty similar to Killswitch.

I wasn't really seeing a big difference unless I was just really pushing the footage beyond a realistic level. The improvement in dynamic range, color accuracy, grading flexibility AND noise issues with v-log more than justified the switch to 10bit.
