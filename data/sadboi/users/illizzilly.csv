books,fp1kxxs,t1_fozrjl5,1588239089.0,"When I was in middle school, I read “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,” and one of the characters said his favorite treats were Turkish delights. Being an American kid from the south, I’d never heard of Turkish Delights, so I asked my dad (who’d traveled quite a bit) what they were.
He described to me as little cubes of jelly covered in powdered sugar.

So, I got the bright idea that I could make my own Turkish Delights (these were pre-internet days), at my mom’s house, where I was often unsupervised during summer days. I poured a jar full of strawberry jam - the kind I would’ve used on a peanut butter and *jelly* sandwich- onto a cookie sheet baking tray, smoothed it out, sprinkled powdered sugar over the top and, how was I going to make it congeal so I could cut it into squares? That’s right! Freeze it! 

So, I stuck it in the freezer. Luckily we had a big freezer that was mostly full, because after a couple of hours, my jelly still wasn’t hard, and I thought I might have to wait overnight and I needed to hide the evidence from the adult in the house. So, I successfully concealed my jelly tray before my mom came home that evening, and when she was gone the next morning, I checked on it again: still runny jelly.

I hid that tray full of jam in the freezer for almost a week before I resigned myself that it was time to throw in the towel and clean it all up. Yuck. 

I learned that summer that jelly doesn’t freeze, like alcohol.

I did taste it... it was not how I’d imagined it.

Years later, I’ve tried real Turkish delights and I like them, but don’t *love* them. My favorite is rose flavor."

That means beignets and crayfish bisque and jambalaya, it means shrimp remoulade, pecan pie, and red beans with rice, it means elegant pompano au papillote, funky file z'herbes, and raw oysters by the dozen, it means grillades for breakfast, a po' boy with chowchow at bedtime, and tubs of gumbo in between. It is not unusual for a visitor to the city to gain fifteen pounds in a week--yet the alternative is a whole lot worse.
