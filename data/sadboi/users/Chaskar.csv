It's not as insane as you think, hag (really the only killer I consistently played, especially towards the end of the ""journey"") really makes it easy without the mechanical skill just by having a good intuition and understanding of trap placement and use. For example I'm still very bad at stopping loops and mindgaming, but everything involving playing around the hag's traps I've learned a lot from videos and from playing. 

Also the fact that I was sweating my ass off every game, usually playing in a way I wouldn't at non-red ranks. (Never really committing to chases, protecting hooks, trying to snowball at every opportunity. It was very fun going against swf who really had very interesting ways of countering your play and using new creative tricks. It kinda turned into a battle of wits at that point, that's prob the most fun I've had in the game.)

Though I do believe if survivors really play optimally, they should have the upper hand against an optimal killer since it requires a lot more coordination and tougher choices in my opinion than killer does, though I'm not sure about that since I'm a terrible survivor.

I remember one game yesterday that I was completely destroyed in, they played very safe getting off gens early and played around my traps (hag) very well, though that was one out of the 20 or so I played yesterday.

Frozen,figbnph,t3_f7rlks,1582397911.0,"Quoting from my latest comment:

I think the reason that r/elsanna exists is that these emotions and the relationship between Anna and Elsa, when amplified even further, can naturally lead to a romantic relation between Elsa and Anna."
Frozen,fib9scf,t1_fi9oebd,1582317505.0,"Honestly, never been a big fan of ""messages"" in movies. 

What made Frozen stand out to me were the incredibly emotional scenes with Anna and Elsa, during let it go, FtftiF, the reprise, Snowman etc. 
 
The way the movie protrays these emotions is what makes it so incredible, not the fact that the ""message"" is unique to Disney or something like that. It's not like a good message makes a good movie. I feel Frozen is less akin to a deep piece of fiction criticizing society in a way, or giving out discussing fundamental truths to life and the universe. Frozen seems more akin to a comedy show for emotions. Like you'd come to a comedy show to laugh, you come to Frozen to feel. 

And I think the reason that r/elsanna exists is that these emotions and the relationship between Anna and Elsa, when amplified even further, can naturally lead to a romantic relation between Elsa and Anna."

Maybe try to hit up a coach?"
chess,fi4qvdp,t1_fi4qe7q,1582146645.0,"Well, I've seen a lot of players who default to just playing the same thing every game, usually they end up stuck at 1000 for years. 

Yeah, maybe you can teach them systems, but it's an easy trap to fall into."

chess,fi3u428,t3_f6brvk,1582127687.0,"I think the best order is: 

-The very basic endgames, just to get used to the pieces, mate with queen, mate with 2 rooks, pawn promotion.

-Basic opening principles such as develop your pieces, put pawns in the center, castle, maybe teach them one or two classic opening setups like the one you see in the italian. Don't teach them a system, that'll start bad habits.

-A lot of middlegame theory, tactics, strategy, this should take up a lot more time than the other ones, because games are won and lost here usually at beginner level. As you said it won't come down to a endgame blunder."

GlobalOffensive,fi0dina,t1_fhy9xnq,1582034257.0,"Applying your same reasoning to a different concept, in this case the earth.
Obviously, the earth is round, if you want to go from Britain to New York we follow a curved flight path. 

But what happens if we instead go 1/1000000 of the way to New York. It ends up pretty straight, okay, go 1/1000000 further. Straight again. Hmmm. It seems that we *can* go straight to New York!

But wait, there's a problem. Every time you start a new 1/1000000 step you're aligning yourself with the ground at that point and going parallel to that new slope. It's a tiny tiny difference, but you *are* changing direction each and everytime. 

Now do that 1000000 times, and magically, you have approximated the actual flight path very accurately, which is a curved line. 

Since this is basically also the essence of calculus, I recommend watching [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=2) by 3blue1brown on the topic if you have further interest."

You'd for example make a post going into a problem you worked on and what interesting conclusions are drawn from that, kinda how you'd show your friend in class something cool you found."
