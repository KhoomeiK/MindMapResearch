depression,ewshdd6,t3_cpv5z6,1565727608.0,i get this. a lot. I’ve been having panic attacks about death- or the threat of a long life since i was 10? 11? it’s genuinely horrible. i don’t have anything either OP but there’s room in the boat for one more.
depression,ewsgghl,t3_cpvwhh,1565727078.0,i empathize with this. it’s almost that if i’m high-functioning- do i even have depression to begin with then? if it’s not dragging me over the coals and destroying all aspects of my life- does it inverse to be just being ‘normal’ and having really shitty days-or moments?

Thank you for the advice."
depression,evewcnr,t1_eveuwfk,1564481251.0,"It snowballed my last year in the Navy. Started passing out at work, was pulling 48 hrs w/o sleep several times a week. Started breaking down.Got ‘help’ and got kicked out. It’s worse now at home, pretty rough family in terms of support. They don’t get Depression and how one can’t ‘just suck it up like everyone else.’
It feels exactly like a snowball. Don’t know how it got this big . Don’t know if it’ll get any bigger. I have to go to college or I’ll be kicked out of my house, but I know I don’t even have the attention span for it. I don’t have a stress tolerance.
Wish I could tell that voice to shut it. Sounds like it’s always telling me the truth."
mentalhealth,evetebp,t3_cjo7k1,1564478315.0,I thought I was alone in that fear? Had it since I was a kid. It’s terrifying cause you can’t stop it. Used to adore movie vampires and elves because they lived for so long. Time sure does fly.
