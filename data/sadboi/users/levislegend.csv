I did end up warming up to my stepmom and she ended up being one of my favorite people, it just took a long time. Basically my advice would be to do what makes you comfortable, but don’t go out of your way to make someone else uncomfortable (although it seems like you’re reacting the same way anyone else would. You’re not being ridiculous)."

I grew up with a relatively wealthy father (not RICH but definitely wasn’t struggling by any means) and I was expected to have a job if I wanted to pay for my own stuff. Started working at a hardware store at the age of 15 and I’m glad I had these experiences. I learned not to rely on my parents for everything. And I still think I was a little spoiled even with the job and everything. There’s nothing wrong with mopping floors or anything if you want some extra cash to pay for things that aren’t necessary"
