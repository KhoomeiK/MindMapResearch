selfharm,fpbe5h5,t3_gc7cov,1588467933.0,I definitely think about it; I haven’t actually done it for no reason though. But it’s because honestly I get carried away sometimes and some of my scars won’t go away. I think what you’re saying is normal af tho and I’m sure one day I’ll cave to the ‘why the fuck not’ even though I’m not feeling any type of way

I have bpd so I only really self harm in ‘episodes’ but the one I’m having now is extra long lol. I am interested in the rubber band thing tho? What is that? My self harm alternatives was drawing on myself but yeah lol

Pinterest is great for tattoo ideas btw, I think I’ve adapted every single one of my tatt ideas from there!"

AmItheAsshole,fntk2iw,t3_g3keje,1587243233.0,"NAH - but I would be upset if it was kept from me only because it’s such a trivial thing to keep a secret. For me, PERSONALLY, I would get over it but would question why you wouldn’t tell me for a while and wonder what else you could have been keeping from me. It is not overly deep though, if you don’t keep many secrets, it’ll be a situation that will blow over."

But I read into my dreams and can be upset about them for days (which presumably will make me dream about it again?) and then it continues in a cycle. I feel like because I like these things, I’m always looking for signs! I’m just not too sure if these things are advisable for people with Bpd who might be having an episode because we can become obsessive? I’m not even sure if I’m making any sense 😞"
BPD,fnogzy7,t1_fnoe0sp,1587124758.0,I don’t know if I’m obsessing over it because to me it was ‘right the first time’ and I’m really struggling with the obsession part. I don’t know what to do or how to think. It’s really getting me extremely low 😞

AmItheAsshole,fmjr0at,t3_fvlavr,1586135937.0,YTA why would you tell your son that alcohol is a drink that is meant to cure adult sadness? Adult life is shitty; but he’s 6! Could have been more conventional in your reply and quoted the law or something? Guarantee it’s a comment he will remember that you’ve made too.

AmItheAsshole,fmi5k50,t3_fvdtej,1586102871.0,YTA because you used her to test something out on her biggest insecurity without telling her that was your intention. You lied to your friend and I would be upset with you too.
mentalhealth,fmgvwdy,t3_fv1fik,1586059251.0,"I see what you’re saying with glorification; but from my experience of reddit I don’t feel like it’s that. Maybe it’s the subs I follow, but I see it as quite a dark place for mental health in general; even with peoples coping mechanisms like humour it’s dark, but very nitty gritty and real. However I do believe social media sites like Instagram and twitter especially love to romanticise and glamorise depression and that makes me mad"

Anxiety,fmb2p5l,t1_fmb05kr,1585916651.0,"Thank you for taking the time out to read and respond at such length. 

I just wanted to point out and clarify; cheating is horrible but my spirit tells me he wouldn’t do it again, hence I want to try - he definitely feels bad but the obsession of the situation is a killer 😔

I’m going to try DBT when I get a moment, it’s just on top of being a university student (in the U.K. so still need to do my assignments) and living and isolating with my mum who’s a very high risk vulnerable person; whilst having to make the decision of whether I can go back to work and afford not to if they decide not to pay me (my place of work is still open during the pandemic as it’s essential) 

I guess I’m just upset and missing my life but I have read you can work on things after stuff like this and it can get better. Just this whole thing is not how they show in the movies lol 

Again thank you so much for your response and stay safe"

But everyday I feel deflated and as you said any sign or symptom I show of BPD feels ignored or told is an excuse. I get told I’m doing all these ‘great things’ and I should be so proud but I feel like Shit inside and no one wants to acknowledge. 

I’m still on a waiting list for DBT (average waiting about a year - probably longer for a ‘high functioning-) and since being diagnosed I’ve never been treated for it but have done some reckless (and permanent things)

I wish people understood high functioning BPD a bit more
