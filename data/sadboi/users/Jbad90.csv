SuicideWatch,fqwez4x,t1_fqw7a7a,1589702037.0,This world is too complex and over complicated.. I wasn’t meant for this world.. I am too simple .. it’s all so embarrassing and frustrating... I just want to give up and hope to find myself free over this human body..
SuicideWatch,fqwerti,t1_fqw7a7a,1589701835.0,"Perhaps you are right. I am **way** overdue for something good.. the situation I am in is really giving me a struggle.. I thought I should give her a second chance and here I am feeling the same way I did when I left.. sad, alone, and disregarded.. knowing that I am just reopening old wounds and hurting myself **again** is frustrating.. it saddens me that this person made me believe that things will be different and I had so much hope only to have it broken down and stepped on like before.. I know this is not going to work, I’m smart enough to understand that, yet my stupid feelings tricked me again.. what’s the point anymore.. why do I put so much faith in my feelings only to hurt myself.. my head knows that this is all bullshit and the world would give to fucks.. it’s overwhelming knowing I am going to be hurt *again*. Why do I try why do I care and why should I even continue to love..."
SuicideWatch,fqw68p2,t1_fqw2hrc,1589694038.0,I really am trying to find a way and a reason to be here but I sincerely feel like there is no point to my pitiful existence..

SuicideWatch,fqsuu1d,t3_gkriu2,1589619641.0,I have fucked every aspect of my life in all ways possible.. somehow we manage to keep going forward or sideways or whatever.. stay in school. You can do this.. that’s the one huge major fuck up I regret every day!!! I only need a few credits to get my degree but back then drugs were *way* more important.. although I may never finish.. I make sure to tell younger people to not give up that.. my friend I know what it feels like to destroy all the good things going for yourself in life.. just push forward and graduate that school. It will help you find your edge.. good luck man!!
