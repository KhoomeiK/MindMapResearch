EatingDisorders,foj7c65,t3_g7r4fb,1587811267.0,"Hey, I’m in the exact same situation! There’s only 2 of us in the house so we tend to split the food down the middle portion wise but she’s forever giving me more off of her plate and denying sauces etc to “make the meal skinny” horribly triggering. I’ve had disordered eating/p****e cycles since I was 13 and I’m 24 now, mom doesn’t have a clue. Unfortunately my mum kinda loves the competition between us two (weight/portion wise) which isn’t fantastic for my own self image or hers either. 

Seen as though disordered eating is often the result of a lack of control/feeling not in control in other aspects of your life, to me it seems best to take the high road/kind method to show her where her bad thoughts come from to help change her mindset before anything escalates. 

I’m sure your mom cares about you - I’d kindly but firmly call her out on it the next time she brings up food/excess exercise and say something along the lines of (food example) 
“Hey! Don’t say that. We’re literally living through a global pandemic, the last thing that we need to be more concerned about is our own body images! It makes me feel bad for eating (x) when you make comments like that. We’re healthy and alive and that’s all that matters right now really.”

raisedbynarcissists,fh8ak5w,t3_f1mbxv,1581355624.0,"Narcs hate people enjoying anything because they’re often unable to feel true joy. The learning of your new skill also displays your independence and autonomy - plus her watching you not being instantly perfect at the skill skill fuels her impatience so it’s easier for her to do it for you!! Mine is the same, I’ve stopped discussing/attempting hobbies around her because she just ends up resenting my enjoyment too much."
