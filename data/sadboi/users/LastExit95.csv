changemyview,fpi6wq9,t1_fpi27l0,1588634871.0,"Deny it or not, all legislation is derived form some form of morals. Those who say, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt legislate morality!‚Äù, don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. If anything, you‚Äôre proving my point and making a greater case that you can legislate morality than you think. You say, ‚Äúlegislation should be informed by reducing the harms associated with that activity.‚Äù I absolutely agree. But why? This becomes the fundamental and most important question when talking about the morality of all legislation. 

For example, say a senator wants to enact legislation on reducing car accidents. Why? Because he wants less senseless deaths and car accidents can produce fatal results? Why does he believe this? Because he values life. Why? Because he appeals to some sort of moral standard, say religion for example. 

Hope that makes sense."

libertarianmeme,fozikw4,t1_fozh826,1588191263.0,"Well, I think there‚Äôs a lot of rational skepticism behind those people saying that. The closest it‚Äôs been was Ross Perot and that was 20 years ago this year. One of the biggest critiques is that it splits the vote, (which by default, it does). Now others, such as yourself, may view it as a ‚Äúthird option‚Äù or an ‚Äúalternative vote.‚Äù Which is true. Truth is, there are people that do vote for other candidates that are not viable winners or they write it in someone. My brother is one of them. He wrote in some no name Democrat and is now a long suffering Never Trumper. Your vote holds much more power than you think. The long standing consequences can be perceived as too dire for some and not worth it for others. I‚Äôm not negating the fact there is a movement for third party candidates and more largely libertarians (thank god). I just don‚Äôt think it can be taken seriously if it is not statistically, fundamentally, and holistically viable. I admire the libertarian party for wanting to stand out and be the odd man out in a two party system, I even agree with most of its platform and policies. But two things can be true at once: it‚Äôll be a long time coming."
