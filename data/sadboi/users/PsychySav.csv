I was doing awful in school my third year in and had to drop out (for reasons separate from my grades). I did find work that paid more than I expected to make with no degree, though it wasn’t where I wanted to be. Eventually I realized that the one measly year I had left was small in comparison to the boost it would give me to the rest of my life. I dedicated the next year to acing my classes in order to boost my GPA, and actually made it.  I know I need to go back for my masters eventually, but I’m currently getting some good experience and connection at a job I couldn’t have gotten without my degree. 

Long story short, I highly encourage you to power through the last year. It is hard but will be so worth it. Getting out of school with a degree and no debt is a giant blessing in itself. The last year is tiny compared to what you get from it. If you don’t, that’s okay too. You’ll find your way as long as you are able to stay motivated to always strive for improvement.
