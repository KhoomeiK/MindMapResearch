intermittentfasting,ewff6uv,t1_ewfeng8,1565359379.0,"You‚Äôll get there! I haven‚Äôt been perfect by any means, just took it a day at a time. 

For breakfast, it‚Äôs usually anything other than black coffee that makes me a bit shakey after a couple hours. As far as junk food, it seems to be more processed foods that do it, like cookies, cakes, candy bars, and greasy fast food. If it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô sugars like fruit or I just crave carbs and eat a bunch of rolls with dinner, I‚Äôm usually okay. Yesterday I went to an Ethiopian coffee shop and got this pastry with honey and nuts and stuff that didn‚Äôt sit well. I think it was because it was saturated in honey and super sweet."
