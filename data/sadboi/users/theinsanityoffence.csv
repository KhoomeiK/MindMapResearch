What helped for me was I realized I don't need to learn every name. Just the main players. Focus on a period of time and learn the major players, get really involved in what they are doing, the motivations for their actions, the goals they are trying to accomplish. Naturally there will be others that either help or hinder their path. The more you read about a topic the more you'll come into contact with those people. Anything you can do to put a face or to humanize those names will help you remember. Lastly, pretend you have to give a speech on that time period and it's significance. I had to learn my subject to give a training and it has helped solidify the knowledge even further, especially by learning to do my speech without notes. Thinking about what questions an audience may ask and how you'd respond helps develop your knowledge even further by filling in those gaps so that you can answer without looking foolish. Hope this helps."

In school or at work people generally become friends with those they have the most classes or projects with or those sitting closest to them. So people who are physically closest to you (proximity) and whom you spend the most of your day with (time) are most likely to befriend you. Strategy here is to make yourself seen so as to give maximum time and proximity with people. Don't hide by sitting off on a corner. Don't be at the front of class either, if you can help it, since you will be facing away from people. Also, join clubs, get involved in a sport or drama this will accomplish time and proximity and you will find people with mutual interests, people you can actually talk to. 

Don't let that stop at just the clubs and school. Maybe get involved in a church, one with a strong youth group of people from your school. Invite people you meet and have talked to a few times to something fun at home or an activity somewhere.

Schizoaffective DO fits neatly between the two as it meets the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and either a manic or major depressive episode. 

Distinction has to do with when the psychotic features present and their duration. Psychosis because of/or with episodes of mania? Bipolar. Psychosis with major depression or mania but on its own and not because of the depression/mania? Schizoaffective. Psychosis with no mania? Schizophrenia.

Anyway, stick with a branch you are interested in, for me that's mainly ethics but there's also philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, and existentialism that I think are pretty neat-o. Political philosophy is always relevant too."
IWantToLearn,fmiabxb,t3_fv7v6y,1586105595.0,"You can start with active listening techniques. Paraphrasing to see if you grasp what they are saying. Ask open ended questions instead of questions that can be answered with a simple yes/no. 

Therapists work within the framework of very specific theories. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) being the most researched and effective. You may also want to see if you can get  books covering rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), Transactional Analysis, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Reality Therapy/Choice Theory, Existential Therapy, Object Relations, and Motivational Interviewing. All these will give insight into how to better listen, interpret, and give feedback."

IWantToLearn,fmfgnwk,t3_fuy5fn,1586026850.0,"You've got meat and you've got vegetables. So start with what you like and try different cooking methods: sear, bake, grill. I recommend ""I'm just here for the food"" by Alton Brown. He breaks down the cooking methods. Also check out ""The Vegetable Butcher"" for a good primer on prepping and cooking veggies. Round out your plate with a grain, like rice, quinoa, or whatever. 

Next experiment with making a quick sauce and spice blends. Branch out to making your own stocks from veggie scraps, then to soups and stews. Recipes online are a good place to experiment but I like books and video. Lots of places on YouTube are good. Check out Epicurious they do videos with 4 levels of cooking amateur to pro. I also like America's Test Kitchen books and the show on PBS."
IWantToLearn,fmf55il,t3_fuvfiz,1586020140.0,"How to fight is pretty broad. You did say to defend against jumping or robbery which placed you in the realm of self defense. Forget what you see in the movies and practice sprinting. Best defense is to never fight, run away, screw your ego and get to safety. 

That said, fighting utilizes many tools: kicks for long range, punches for mid range, elbows and knees for close quater, throws, grappling, and groundwork round out the mix. Many martial arts specialize/focus on one way: I prefer a mix of BJJ and Muay Thai.  Sparring is essential, so find a partner to practice with. Get tall partners, small partners, partners who are slim and fast, slow but powerful, partners who only box defensively, partners who only try to take you to the ground. The more variety the better. Make them fight you in tandem. Give them foam bats or nerf knives to practice avoiding and deflecting weapons...not to ""beat"" them but to escape the danger. Read the Tao of Jeet Kune Do. Watch the Active Self Protection channel on YouTube. Go over to r/fightporn and watch some street fights. Don't be niave. Screw bravado. Be realistic. Lastly, you must train everyday. This will not come to you overnight and your skill will leave you if you stop."
IWantToLearn,fmev36d,t3_eej9j5,1586014168.0,"You can start with the DSM-V which psychiatrists use for mental illness diagnosis. I recommend the book ""A users guide to the brain"" as an primer for how the brain works. Then read ""the man who mistook his wife for a hat"" for short true stories of interesting ways the mind can mess up. It's by Oliver Saks and he has a lot of interesting books. One, awakenings, was turned into a movie. Watch it. Next check out ""becoming attached"" a book about how early childhood experiences shape us. It's on attachment theory but also has implications for psychoanalysis and object relations theory. 

These recommendations will help with both psychology and psychiatry. However, if you pursue psychiatry you'll need to go to medical school first. Majoring in psychology will not help you. However if you choose psychology then expand to books on motivation, emotion, cognition, memory, behavior, and learning."
