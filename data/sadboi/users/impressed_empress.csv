UKFrugal,fpa73tx,t3_gc6acr,1588442147.0,"I think cremation is a good thing, ashes can be scattered at gardens or wherever. I've also heard about how some cheap coffins generally fall apart after a while, and of course tombstones and paying for plots and stuff isn't exactly the cheapest option.  Bear in mind that scattering ashes at places like Kew Gardens for example actually costs around Â£500 (as a donation). Some people like their ashes to be mixed into soil to be used to plant trees and that could be a great way to give back to the earth. I've also heard crazy ways where they're put into fireworks!"

Anxiety,f46x98i,t3_djolrh,1571414588.0,"Please see a therapist/psychiatrist. These symptoms do seem a lot like anxiety and stress, although I'm no doctor, I only speak from personal experience. If you have issues that interfere with your life, which it sounds like it does, then please seek help. The problem is unlikely to go away on its own and will likely just get worse.

In regards to medicine, it really depends on what your therapist says and what your issue is. It differs from person to person. If you don't want to take medicine it's up to you, you can decide not to take any. You might not be prescribed any. 

However, if it isn't anxiety and it's something else then perhaps taking medicine will help you. Ultimately, listen to your doctor, they know best. I wish you luck."

3. Hot Fuzz (2007) or Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)
4. Antz (1998) I don't think it's shit but man is it an ugly film.
