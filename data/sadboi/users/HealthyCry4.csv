That being said though, if/when I publish anything, it will be under a pen name for the reasons you've stated. ;) One of my families several years ago now found out I was a writer and asked if I would bring something for their son to read and I awkwardly told them that what I write isn't exactly appropriate for kids...

A few notes:- I do laundry every other Sunday and then I put together two weeks' worth of work outfits before going to bed that Sunday night.

\- I have a four-day work week, so on Sunday nights and Tuesday nights I will make pasta salad for the two following work days. Each night I get my lunch bag as close to assembled as possible (set beverages next to pasta salad in fridge, put snacks and eating utensil in bag so beverages and pasta salad can be added in right before I leave in the morning)

I set one alarm for the desired time, and one for five minutes after (for example, 5 and then 5:05). I have an alarm set for 45 minutes later for a shower, and then 45 minutes after my shower alarm (5:45 and 6:30 respectively in my example) for when I absolutely need to leave the house by. Before my shower I allow myself as much internet browsing as I want; fifteen minutes beforehand I'll take my meds and eat my breakfast, but when that 5:45 timer goes off, I HAVE to shower.

Shower timer goes off, I use the bathroom, wash my hands, and then turn the water on while I'm brushing my teeth so it'll be warm by the time I'm done. Hop in, shampoo/soap/rinse, hop out, dry off, apply deodorant/body spray, get dressed. Shoes, socks, bag, keys, finish packing lunch bag, kiss my cat's head (a very important step), out the door.

If there is something unusual that I desperately need to bring with me, I set it next to the door the night before or even blocking the door so that I can't leave in the morning without at least noticing it.

EDIT: I almost forgot until I saw a later comment; I also trick myself into thinking that I need to leave at least ten minutes early. On days that I need to be at Monday/Thursday workplace at 7:15 and it's supposed to take me 25 minutes, I will typically leave at 6:30. On days that I need to be at Tuesday/Wednesday workplace at 7:30 and it's supposed to take me 20 minutes, I will typically leave at 7."

I'm an occupational therapist in the US and started having this nagging feeling of ""I don't think this is right for me"" when I was in the middle of my program, but I attributed it to anxiety at the time. I worked full-time in the field for a year and realized that it really wasn't right for me, and so I applied to an MLIS program and was accepted. I don't know enough about library technicians or that program because I don't think they are common here, but hopefully this will be helpful for you.

A few things:

* Have you considered being a school OT? It tends to be less liability/conflict with the possibility of part-time. If working with kids absolutely isn't your thing, I get that too.
* I feel like both degrees were practically useless (MLIS more than MSOT). This has always been very distressing to me, lol. My OT internships and my part-time library gig that I had for the last half of my program were what I found really useful.
* Even though I felt that way about both degrees, I never experienced that ""I don't think this is right for me"" feeling during my MLIS program. Yes, there is still stress and responsibility, but I used to worry myself sick every morning before going to my OT job whereas I look forward to going to my library gig.
* I'm not sure if this is the same in Canada, but job availability and pay are both issues that should be considered. I got the first OT job I applied to after passing the NBCOT in an area that is supposedly oversaturated with OTs and yet I've had three unsuccessful interviews for full-time librarian positions since recently graduating with my MLIS and I have applied to at least ten others in the area."
