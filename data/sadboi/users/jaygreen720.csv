And even if he did, he might be the kind of person who'd actually appreciate the lie. It wasn't intended to harm, it was done out of care.

I actually remember a while ago, someone I knew asked a question and got an honest, though unsettling, answer. After the responder left, the asker muttered, ""She should have just lied to me."" I was baffled at the time, but this is part of how I know that these people do exist."

* Give myself actual compliments and appreciation outloud whenever I do something right

* Adjust my body posture so that I'm standing tall and proud whenever possible. (The body actually affects the mind.)

* Never compare myself to others. Only compare myself to myself and appreciate the progress I've made

* Treat myself with the same kindness and understanding as I treat other people. I don't insult other people or judge them harshly, I always try to see the best in people, so now I'm doing that to myself too. (Maybe I'm weird, but it helps me to think of myself as a separate person, which isn't entirely untrue since being a human means being a collection of systems working together. Even the brain has at least two separate halves working together)
