AnimalCrossing,fqkufne,t1_fqkubfg,1589436596.0,I made a custom design that was just the number 1 so it was a little easier to keep count of how many I had placed plus it made measuring things much simpler. You could try that next time and see if it makes things a little easier!

You can always plan out where you want to move something before you commit to it by using custom paths or digging holes to mark the placement in the ground. When you actually place the building it will just go over the markings you‚Äôve used :) very helpful to avoid those tiny annoyances!"
AnimalCrossing,fqktw7b,t1_fqktq5e,1589436153.0,Aw that‚Äôs awesome!

AnimalCrossing,fqks2s2,t3_gjf1h2,1589434708.0,"I totally relate to what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôve been trying to remember this game is designed to be played for a very long time and there‚Äôs really no rush. Plus, if you get to the point you‚Äôve ‚Äúfinished‚Äù your island and have all your dream villagers and everything is perfect then what exactly is there do anymore?  I still look at AC posts but I just save things for future inspiration and try not to compare my playthrough to anyone else‚Äôs. Just enjoy your time with the game and try not to worry about what everyone else is doing. There will always be people further ahead and there will always be people just starting out. That‚Äôs helped me to enjoy the game much more than when I first began playing and was constantly comparing to all these 5 star islands!"
AnimalCrossing,fqkra9h,t1_fqkr2o3,1589434099.0,Lol yeah that would be ideal but then I‚Äôd truly have no life!

AnimalCrossing,fqkqk2s,t1_fqkqeut,1589433545.0,"Yep!  This game is designed to take a really long time to get everything you want, I don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre all trying to rush through it so fast!  What will there be left to do once everything is perfect?  I think the fun in the game for me has been seeing what items I can get each day and seeing things slowly take shape. But I also low key just want everything to be done and perfect haha it‚Äôs so hard!"
AnimalCrossing,fqkqefv,t3_gjfl54,1589433428.0,This is so adorable!! I didn‚Äôt know there was a pink version of that wallpaper. It looks really good!  Would definitely come over for fries and a milkshake!
AnimalCrossing,fqkqa8w,t1_fqkq485,1589433343.0,Aww thank you that sounds amazing!   I‚Äôm such a perfectionist so this game can be very frustrating for me haha I keep trying to remember I‚Äôll be able to play it for years to come so there‚Äôs really no rush to finish my island. It‚Äôs just hard seeing how amazing some of the things people have already made are! But yes I‚Äôll be sure to let you know whenever I can visit!
AnimalCrossing,fqkq0l9,t1_fqkpu0n,1589433144.0,I would love to!  I‚Äôm currently in the process of restarting because I hated where my residential services building was but whenever I get my dream map I‚Äôll be happy to visit once I unlock flying!
AnimalCrossing,fqkpv0i,t1_fqkpoh7,1589433032.0,"You could try redoing the paths in just one section of the residential area to see if you like it, no need to move any houses or anything. If you like it you can work on changing the rest and if you hate it then you haven‚Äôt wasted your time changing everything up. Maybe it could give you a little inspiration and help you discover exactly what it is you want to do. The great thing about this game is you can always change something so if you decide you don‚Äôt like it in a week or a month or whatever you can always switch it up again :)"
AnimalCrossing,fqkpo6b,t3_gjfl7g,1589432895.0,I love how light and bright this is!  Some cozy beach cottage vibes :)
AnimalCrossing,fqkph9r,t3_gjfocf,1589432754.0,"The way you‚Äôve designed your layout with the long vertical pathways to the villager homes has left a lot of long narrow green spaces. You could try to keep them and use them as small gardens/yards/orchard areas. If you decide you want to change the layout up a little you could try to vary how you make your pathways to the houses so the leftover green space has a little more variety than rectangular and narrow. Maybe try making some pathways that aren‚Äôt straight and look a little more natural? I think what you have now looks very nice, but you may like it a little more if things weren‚Äôt so same-y."

What exactly is it you‚Äôre unhappy with?  I‚Äôm finding my problem is I have too many things I want to do and not enough room to actually make them happen.  Maybe just pick one thing to work on, whatever you‚Äôre the most excited about, and get that area looking how you like. Maybe that will inspire you for the next area and so on.  That‚Äôs what‚Äôs been working for me so far even though it is hard knowing I‚Äôll have to scrap some ideas in the end.  Your island looks great so far though, don‚Äôt be discouraged!"

BPD,fpra5za,t3_gf3ity,1588847913.0,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre struggling right now. Intrusive thoughts are something everyone deals with. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a bad person. They aren‚Äôt your true desires.  The fact that you‚Äôre bothered by having these thoughts is just evidence that you‚Äôre highly unlikely to ever act on any of them.  Hopefully that can help you to stress about them a little less. 

Do you see a therapist or counselor?  I suggest you do if you don‚Äôt already, and just tell them you‚Äôre having intrusive thoughts and would like some tools to help deal with the anxiety those thoughts are causing you.  They should be able to give you some tools to help.  

In the meantime, maybe try doing something to distract yourself when you start focusing on those thoughts.  I‚Äôve found my intrusive thinking only gets worse if I‚Äôm constantly worrying about it.  If you can take your focus off of them and on to something else (a movie, a book, a game, a conversation, whatever works best for you) I think it might help you feel a little better when those thoughts start popping up. 

Practicing mindfulness is also something that has personally helped me a lot with intrusive thinking. 

Please try not to feel too bad for having intrusive thoughts. It‚Äôs completely normal and I promise you aren‚Äôt a bad person at all. If you ever need a non-judgmental ear to listen, please pm me, I‚Äôm happy to talk :)"

kpophelp,flsgf46,t3_fqoqb6,1585441543.0,"Blackpink House is a good one to get to know them, I binged it when I first got into them and it made me fall in love with all the members 

LOONA has super short ~1 minute videos called LoonaTV that are great, they also recently did a longer form series called LOONA The Tam where the girls go have fun at a theme park together 

Rocket Punch has some good behind the scenes/reality content on their YouTube 

Everglow also did a reality series at a theme park

I‚Äôm pretty sure everything is just on their official YouTube channels"
LOONA,flmwau2,t3_fpfryi,1585299374.0,"This is so sweet and I really hope she gets to hear it.  I feel so much for Haseul, and other idols who struggle with anxiety and other mental health issues, I can‚Äôt imagine trying to maintain my mental health while doing the job they have."
kpophelp,fljntxn,t1_fljmtiw,1585220460.0,"I‚Äôm so glad you found a few you like!  The best thing about LOONA is they have so many different types of music, each sub-unit has its own distinct sound, and each member within each sub-unit has a unique sound while still making sense within the sub-unit. 

I think the best way to get to know loona‚Äôs discography after your interest has been sparked is to listen to the solos and sub-unit singles in release order (pref. with MVs). Then I‚Äôd probably suggest checking out the full group title tracks in order (including Favorite, the group‚Äôs pre-debut track) and exploring from there. Since you already know you like Odd Eye Circle, you‚Äôll probably like the yyxy songs and solos more than 1/3‚Äôs songs. 

And real quick I‚Äôll give you the order of the girls‚Äô debuts and the title tracks in case you decide to go that route with it. 

Heejin - HyunJin - Haseul - Yeojin - ViVi// 1/3 sub-unit//  Kim Lip - JinSoul - Choerry// Odd Eye Circle// Yves - Chuu - GoWon - Olivia Hye// yyxy//  
Favorite// Hi High// Butterfly// So What

Both 1/3 and Odd Eye Circle have two title tracks, unfortunately yyxy wasn‚Äôt able to release the repackage album like the other units. Each solo member has at least one MV as well as all the title tracks. 

If there‚Äôs any other way I can help you get to know LOONA lmk :) I‚Äôm still a relatively new orbit but I just love them so much I‚Äôm excited to share about them haha"
kpophelp,flj5x1w,t1_flj467d,1585199925.0,"Her solo is called Love Cherry Motion, it‚Äôs super upbeat with a bit of a twist to it. 

I don‚Äôt watch a lot of anime so I‚Äôll just try to list their most upbeat songs and hopefully a few of them are what you‚Äôre looking for :) 

ViViD - Heejin solo
Into The New Heart - 1/3 sub-unit intro (I always think this sounds like it belongs in an anime)
Heart Attack - Chuu solo
One & Only - Go Won solo
love4eva - yyxy sub-unit single
Hi High - LOONA single
Number One - LOONA b-side
Ding Ding Dong (Ddaeng Ddaeng Ddaeng) - LOONA b-side

They have other upbeat songs but they lean more towards cutesy or girl crush/chill so let me know if you might wanna check something like that out. Hopefully you like at least one of the songs I mentioned :) 

Also, the most anime thing about LOONA (imo) is the rich lore behind pretty much everything they do. The videos, lyrics, teasers, photo shoots, all tie together into a big sci-fi kind of story. If you‚Äôre interested in going down that rabbit hole (it goes deep lol) I can link a couple of videos that help explain things pretty well."
kpophelp,flj20q4,t3_fp43qb,1585196583.0,If you haven‚Äôt checked out their solo songs/b-sides yet I suggest you do that. I think you‚Äôll probably like Choerry‚Äôs the best out of the three of them.
BlackPink,flip3nx,t3_fow05m,1585187407.0,"I had a friend who had been trying to get me into k-pop for a while.  Honestly, at first I didn‚Äôt like BP. She sent me the link to AIIYL and I was not into it.  I thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs too cutesy, like all kpop‚Äù (I was an idiot, I‚Äôm aware). Then when KDA happened (the League of Legends k-pop group) I fell in love with that song and decided to give kpop another chance. Luckily, my friend decided to send me Ddu-du Ddu-du and I thought it was amazing. I ended up watching all their other videos, then some interviews and variety show appearances, then I started watching Blackpink House and fell in love with the members and their personalities.  I‚Äôve been obsessed ever since and have expanded my horizons to a ton of kpop groups and solo artists :) thanks Gabby for not giving up on getting me into kpop, it‚Äôs genuinely such a source of joy in my life that I desperately need"
