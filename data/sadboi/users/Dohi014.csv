Without extensive reading I can agree that other countries are dealing with abductions just as much (if not more). From what I’ve read about aliens, and earth; they have “gas stations” or “garages” (pit stops more or less) all over the place. Which brings in crop circles because that’s how they know what is where. (Like our billboards) In isolated communities, who knows how often they get abducted! In America, the rumor I’ve always leaned towards, is that a past president made deals with these visitors. It’s probably why it all seems so much more prevalent/frequent/common. I imagine, in countries where the citizens matter, any deals made, are probably a lot more “strict”."

Ramen is everyone’s go to. Canned veggies or canned meat really go a long way in ramen. Pick your favorites, try different combinations, you can’t get sick of ramen that way. I like frying my ramen and dousing it in sweet chili (my cheapo go to lunch)

Pork loins (find them on sale) can be sliced into several pork chops. It’s pricier but, worth a few extra dollars to have pork chops for a couple weeks. 

Hamburger helpers and those side dish packets; go crazy! Neither one costs more than a couple dollars. Jazz it up with what you got in the house, boom! Dinner. Hungry for nachos? I recommend the cheesy enchilada hamburger helper. Make it a thicker, add some salsa or w/e you like, and scoop your chips. 

Goulash; elbow macaroni, burger, veggies (mostly onion and pepper). You can make a big pot of it for under $10 and it’ll last you all week (or longer). 

Baked chicken; again, it might take a couple extra dollars but, it’s meat that’ll last awhile, and can be recycled in other dishes. 

Chili is another under $10 dinner that’ll last awhile in the fridge. Remembering to freeze excess leftovers also helps your future self with “cheap” meals. 

Meals from scratch are hard unless you have everything available to you. Take advantage of coupons, grocery deals, etc. I use the flipp app and love it.

More ghosts

If you’ve ever heard of Prairie du Chien, it’s got quite a few ghosts hanging around. St Feriole island is covered in shadow figures. Visits to Villa Louis have proven that’s got its own ghost or ghosts. During tours I’ve had my clothes tugged, doors opened and closed on their own, and i heard knocking. 

The northern Prairie du Chien, Trempealeau, id guess has a few ghosts. It’s about as old as pdc but, I swear it’s quiet. I don’t think I’ve had one solid encounter there. I get creeped out by how few energies I feel. 

La Crosse is totes haunted. Lived next to the swamps and would hear screaming. My second house in lacrosse had a bunch of stuff hidden in the rafters in random spots; the more I pulled out, the more often I thought I saw someone in my peripheral. Ghosty had his spot in the house though so I just tried to give him respect, put the stuff I found there “with him”, and would say hello once in awhile when I was in “his territory”. A friend staying in a hotel there got pulled out of bed. 

Wisconsin Dells is pretty haunted too. Nothing to write home about but, the energy there is electrifying. Some places, I could be standing alone, and it’d still feel like there’s was a bunch of people. I question my sanity there; how many people on the street are alive and how many are dead?? Place is thick. At least the spirits there seem friendly. 

I’ve lived up and down the Mississippi on the west side of Wisconsin. They say spirits love running water, and I’d have to agree, as I’ve always had experiences. The history of the fur trade (among other things) really left it’s mark here."

I go past/through a couple stores to get to the grocery store. It’s a basic big box store with everything. There are people there shopping; sometimes they interact with me and are flat out mean. I never go out the way I came; I go through the doors in the grocery store. 

In the posh side of town there are tall buildings, I always thought they were skyscrapers. The other side of town just had one or two story buildings. 

Also, the building before the bridge, just seems to be a hodgepodge. I can see it as being a train station of sorts, definitely a stop before the “city”. I always go to the cafe there and get the special."
Paranormal,flt8pxw,t1_flt68e6,1585463011.0,"When I’m on the one side of the bridge, it’s rural; mostly trees, and the road isn’t always paved. There’s a cafe/gas station (idk what) just before the bridge. I always stop there before I cross the bridge. When on the bridge, everything is distorted. Some stuff looks far away, some things look large, some are obscenely tall, idk *distorted*. But once I’m on foot, walking around, I don’t notice that as much. Everything is “normal”. Sometimes insides of buildings feel more vast then they are."
Paranormal,flt3jv1,t3_fr05q6,1585458172.0,"I always pay close attention to these posts. I’ve always wondered, if it is another plane of existence, maybe someone else sees it too. I’ve always seen the “largeness” of the buildings as something to do with depth perception being wonky. You’re definitely the closest to what I see every night. Do you cross the bridge into the city every night too?"
movies,flt20t1,t3_fqjj1j,1585456904.0,"My grandpa, like most good ole men, loved his westerns. My sister came way too early, and she, with our mom, my uncle, and that good ole guy, would watch John Wayne. It was engrained in me early on, he was, is, and will always be the best (big screen) cowboy. My grandpa passed a long time ago. Those movies are what my family has left of his memory. 

When True Grit (2010) was released, they were appalled, absolutely outraged. They swore up and down they’d never watch it, and promised me not to either. 

So, in my wayward opinion, that matters to none, the only True Grit worth watching, stars John Wayne. I’ll be reading the book, as suggested by other commenters; maybe my grandad read it too."
americandad,flonlrd,t3_fpylrj,1585341792.0,"At school one day, everyone is going about as normal, when suddenly dude’s in suits (pinstripe and hazmat) strolled in, scoping the place out. The next morning the teachers were acting off but, no matter what or who you asked, the answer was “I don’t know.” 

After a few days of everyone trying to act normal with these dudes running tests all over; it finally come out that 80% of the school is still made of asbestos materials, and the other school had a sewage leak. 🤦‍♀️"

I remember it being hyped up, and fizzling out; is always assumed it was because it was under control. My mind is absolutely blown atm. It definitely contradicts info I’ve seen too.

technology,fl94lgr,t1_fl73jep,1584940832.0,"While all that may be true, it also does come down to common sense. Which, like some sort of shitty magic trick, the virus has revealed how little *anyone* has of that; from politicians, to the local Karen, and the homeless guy with the crazy eyes. If the virus is spreading, if people are still getting sick, if we’re poorly, and nearly entirely, under equipped for such a situation, and states/governor’s (and a lot more) are shutting things down, then maybe, *just maybe*, we should at least *try* to abide. Spring break vacations, large gatherings, parties, crowding grocery stores, traveling; all these are unnecessary, and actually dangerous right now. That just loops back to common sense. 

And because I probably should elaborate; traveling, I know it can be important. This is “job security” topic territory. People shouldn’t be forced to travel for work, let alone believe its an ok thing to do, *right now*. If a lot of these people are just trying to get to their families, clearly that’s ok but, it’s mind boggling to see all the “displaced” people. The pandemic has been an ongoing thing for awhile, I myself, can’t understand why there is still so much traveling going on. Globally, planes and boats, is bad enough; imagine trains, and buses. Again, these can be, and are necessary but, when and where is the line drawn to stop the spreading of the virus? (that is, if it can’t be controlled sooner than later) 

I’m not an expert, no one is; my point remains that we all just need a little more common sense. We need to be careful for everyone’s sake."
