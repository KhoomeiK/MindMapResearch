BipolarReddit,fk6mbry,t3_fgl0v9,1583906868.0,"I had the worst hangovers while on Lamictal, lasting up to 2 days. Not that bad hangovers after I quit Lamictal. 

I also take Seroquel, Lithium and Cipralex (has another name in the US). 

Be careful when mixing Lithium and alcohol. Since alcohol severly dehydrates you, you need to drink a lot of water to make up for it so your lithium blood levels dont rise to toxic levels.

I think ive read about someone dying to seroquel + alcohol combo by suffocating/stopping to breath while asleep. So maybe dont overdo it.

I would say its not super risky combining these, so if you know yourself well and your limits if thats possible while being bipolar, have fun. But I would suggest to just dont drink too much the first couple of times to see how it feels and take it from there. 

Ps, im not a doctor. 

Good luck!"
