relationship_advice,fphbpup,t3_gd6okt,1588618434.0,"I hate this! There are definitely times it’s okay to vent to friends but this is a big pet peeve of mine. A relationship is just that, a relationship. Things should be kept between the two of you. It’s immature and almost always ends up with the friends hating the S/O because all they hear about is the bad."
ontario,fnfknfu,t1_fnf1qa2,1586909924.0,Another major thing is that I just feel bad In general going to my boss and saying I don’t want to work because I’m nervous about covid. Obviously there’s nothing wrong with that but I feel bad leaving them to dry and feel as though some people around me might think I’m using it as an excuse. Which is whatever. That’s just my brain lol.
ontario,fnfk4un,t1_fnf1qa2,1586909625.0,Yeah for real. Damn I really don’t know what to do.
ontario,fne6lkl,t1_fne5bvo,1586883967.0,"Yeah, we need major clarity. I’m currently on EI but supposed to start work Thursday. I just don’t want to start work for a week then be shut down only to figure out EI/ or that CERB stuff. I emailed the region by law office so I’ll see what they say."
ontario,fncko4k,t1_fmr1ml8,1586839209.0,So lawn care is non essential? I’m supposed to be starting work on Thursday doing lawn care/landscaping but I’m getting mixed answers. I’m currently on EI and don’t want to start work only to be told a week later it’s non essential and we aren’t working anymore and I have to figure out EI or CERB all over again. Thank you.
ontario,fnckb27,t3_fw9079,1586838936.0,I’m kind of confused if landscaping is an essential service. The paragraph on the website regarding maintenance is very grey and doesn’t really lay it out well. Supposed to be starting work Thursday but I’m concerned. Thank you.
AskWomen,fn1hn1l,t3_fyj9t3,1586562204.0,"I feel like it affects us because it’s harder for him to understand my perspective or feelings on certain things that have to do with my family. He can’t understand how past things still effect me today or have influenced who I am, because his family life has been relatively “normal” and his parents are very respectful and loving towards him. They love having him around. 
I on the other hand feel like seeing a healthy family interact was quite shocking at first, and still can be in certain instances. I’ll find myself thinking “wow, this is what families do?” When they’re just all sitting in the living room laughing and chatting. 
But it’s also given me hope I could have a family some day like that and is a good environment for me."
AskWomen,fn1h84z,t1_fmzwgz7,1586561956.0,"Same with me. I felt as though every little thing he did bothered me. And I tried to get over it but I couldn’t. And then every little thing his family did bothered me. And I started resenting him. And that’s not fair. There were some other factors but ultimately there wasn’t one huge reason which made it harder to break up with him cause I knew he’d be so heart broken. It was unexpected for him but I didn’t want to keep it going forever for my sake and for his.  I also felt I outgrew the relationship like you said. We were together from 15-22 and that’s the key ages from changing from a child to adult. So I just really felt like I changed as a person and what I wanted in a SO changed. 
He was also a terrible communicator. 
I’m in a happy relationship now, with someone so unexpected. And although we have issues like any normal couple, we communicate and keep trying."
TwoXChromosomes,fn1f89n,t3_fyjvta,1586560770.0,Yup. It makes me really angry. I feel like I’m not being taken seriously. It’s an unattractive quality.

TrueOffMyChest,fla7ylx,t3_fnjhnu,1584978546.0,"I feel for you. Thank you for what you are doing. My separated parents wanted to bring my brother home from the city because he is bored and should be around others. They wanted him to come to my moms (where I live) then my dads, then maybe go stay at my sisters whom has two young kids. I said they are missing the point. He should be staying home and definitely not traveling from house to house. But then I was made to feel bad and told I was selfish and to grow up. At first I felt so bad I cried and thought I was wrong, but then I realized I’m totally right. It’s common sense. They want to do the exact opposite of what we’ve been told. My brother can survive boredom by himself. He’s not the only one alone. They literally wanted to do the exact opposite of what we should be doing, and then when I spoke up with common sense they made me feel bad. They’re the ones and my brother who should feel selfish possibly risking people and their family."

AskWomen,fii5uzg,t3_f7x7s9,1582417759.0,"My dog was licking my moms toes. She didn’t have socks on. She also has problems with fungus. When I was about 14 I said something on the lines of it being gross and she shouldn’t let the dog do that because it’s gross, and she has fungal problems with her toe nails. She then says “well at least I don’t have acne!” Then calls me a bitch. When I was 14. I’ve never forgotten it and she denies it to this day. My dad also said I gained weight twice when I was in college and also to this day denies it. Has never said anything to my sister whom would be considered pretty over weight about her health and I’ve always been considered a normal weight my entire life. They both deny it. Drives me nuts."

TwoXChromosomes,fghvo6b,t3_eykg5g,1580795253.0,"I understand the frustration with birth control. It can be so hard to find what works for you and can be so wacky with your hormones, when I got my IUD put in I went just over 3 weeks straight bleeding. I kept getting paranoid about it but eventually it stopped. Everyone reacts differently. Now I still get my period but it’s as you describe it, brown spotting for about 5-6 days. Personally I probably would just wait it out as much as it sucks. I think this is your body adjusting from BC to BC. But if it really does keep going I would maybe say get off BC for a while and let your body adjust back to normal? Try not to stress yourself out about it though. I remember being really anxious for how long I was bleeding but it was ultimately my body adjusting. :)"
relationship_advice,fg3trhy,t3_ewp4xi,1580489496.0,Him saying everyone can do it is unfair. And him getting upset is even unfair. He should be glad you’ve even been giving it a try in the first place.
relationship_advice,ffjqcdi,t3_etyj83,1580004254.0,"The argument of “that’s different” is bullshit, break up with him. He has no respect for you or those other girls.

Sounds like you’re taking out your past resentment towards your parents on your child. I despise this way of thinking. Wouldn’t you want what’s best for your child? Learn from your past. You have the option to make things better for your child and your grandchild, and it seems like your daughter is trying too."

depression,f8715c5,t3_cmcier,1574312522.0,"I had been doing this too. Would say I was physically ill. One day I was at my end and needed a major break, It was a Wednesday night and I felt like I was just blank. Like I couldn’t do anything anymore. I was honest and told my boss I really needed the two days off to go away for a while and told him mentally I felt like I was at my breaking point and would be back Saturday. I just couldn’t do it. (I worked 12 days on with 2 off and doing that already was hard enough) and he was understanding and said take the time you need but we need you back Saturday. I said ok.
Come back Saturday to the bigger boss coming up to me and saying “everyone is going through their own shit. We need employees.” 
I almost got up and left right then and there. Tbh I regret not doing that. 
After that any small amount of motivation for that job was gone and it made me feel even worse. It’s terrible because I feel like that job had a lot of an effect on how I felt and made it worse everyday. I have been done there for three weeks now and I still debate writing the boss an email about how he could speak to his employees better and by him saying “everyone is going through their own shit” includes me and he doesn’t know what I’m going through. Telling him that moment pushed me down harder.
In the long run you do what’s right for you. Most businesses don’t give a shit about you. You matter and your health is more important. Take those days and work on bettering yourself. Life is short. Hoping things look up for you."

I’ve never loved or trusted a person more and I still smile even when I just think about him. I can’t wait for our future together. I think about it probably everyday. :)"
