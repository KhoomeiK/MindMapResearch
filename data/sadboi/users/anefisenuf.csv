I have had them, I was with my husband for 14 years, but in retrospect he was very neglectful so in a way that worked for me. I get easily overwhelmed with people in my personal space and need a lot of rest and time alone. But, the right people respect that. People who don't? I'd rather just be friends, if that. Boundaries are so important and there are just a lot of people in the world who don't understand how to respect them. It's different with people who do."

Sadly, he began to place too much of his identity in being there for me, in saving me, making everything ok or protecting me and it eventually broke down the relationship. So, my advice is don't do that. Get therapy yourself. Educate yourself. Look at your own behavior and needs, learn to set boundaries, don't get caught up in a dream of rescuing or healing her, she's gotta do that herself. If you want to help her in the most significant way the best thing you can do is to be healthy yourself- then you can truly be there for the both of you. She also must be in treatment with a good professional, you can't wing it with trauma. Best of luck to you both."

Some people are seriously emotionally unavailable and rejecting and others are deeply in need of separation between self and others (I tend toward the latter.) There's a ton of literature and advice and popular memes that float around about how to set boundaries (which is great) but you hardly ever see anything about how to respect boundaries and personally I think that's a huge social issue that gets ignored. For example: The last guy I dated had very anxious attachment and didn't understand why I'd get so upset that he kept hugging me when I asked him not to. I know he meant well, he was coming from a loving place, but in his eyes I'm the one with the ""problem"" because I can't ""accept love..."" when on my end I'm laying a clear boundary and you're bulldozing it, that's a huge no for me."
AskWomen,fqed9q6,t1_fqe07fj,1589305651.0,"Avoidant here and Google really does paint us out to be abusers, narcissists and sociopaths... which is crazy, couldn't be further from the truth in my case. There's so much focus on anxious attachment that it seems like the norm. I actually have a lot of secure attachments and long term relationships in my life, I just take a while to develop trust in people that they will respect my boundaries and not try to latch onto me in some overbearing way so I tend to have a guard up for a long time. I have a rocky childhood (probably not unlike most people with attachment issues), so I have found that I can swing mildly anxious when I'm being neglected. Now that I understand how to recognize neglect rather than assuming I'm automatically in the wrong, I would say I have absolutely no anxious/ambivalent tendencies. So that's probably worth exploring, too. I don't think it's always an attachment issue sometimes it's not recognizing a problem in the relationship such as emotional unavailability or neglect."

I'm also doting and generous as a partner and care a lot about meeting my partners needs in a relationship, but once it becomes voiced as a want or something that's expected of me it is ten times harder or impossible to carry out. I can't stand feeling needed or responsible for someone else's happiness, I don't want to have to live up to anyone's standards or follow anyone's rules. I try to stay ahead of that game because myself, as an individual, I care immensely about being good to the people in my life and most people who know me would vouch for me there.

CPTSD,fnnc4kt,t1_fnn9k3v,1587089012.0,"Yes, I'm happy to be supportive and connect with my partner. I love connecting and feeling close. It's when there is some merging or blurring of boundaries that I will shut down. A lot of people have terrible boundaries, I'd venture to say most people have terrible boundaries. What seems like love or help is often invasive and suffocating. I think it's perfectly natural to lean on your partner and healthy to ask for emotional support. 

I honestly think the same can be said for the preoccupied who doesn't work to fulfill their own needs and overcome the fear of rejection/abandonment. I'll be there for you, but it's your job to sort through your feelings and do the work to improve your life. As soon as you start blaming your feelings on me or trying to restrict me in some way because of the way you feel, yeah I'll back off. 

Everything you're describing sounds to me like an issue with poorly developed relationship skills and emotional availability. I can have a deeply rooted fear of being controlled or overpowered by another person and still not be an asshole as a partner. Again, I also think that dismissive types are different from fearful types. Like, I'm avoiding you because I'm scared of you, not because I'm emotionally closed off from myself (never have been) or refuse to connect- and that trait is inherently problematic in a relationship, but it doesn't apply to all people with avoidant attachment. An unhealthy relationship is an unhealthy relationship and I've dated people on both ends of the spectrum and ultimately the same issues occur on both sides... both people are willing to do the work to develop a secure and healthy bond with themselves and with each other or they're not."
CPTSD,fnn34k3,t1_fnn1ho8,1587083395.0,"I mean, I'm avoidant but I also date avoidants because my fear is of enmeshment/control/abuse, not abandonment/loss, so I can relate to that. I would say if we differentiate between fearful and dismissive, that matters.

I care a great deal, I am emotionally available, warm, loving and attentive. I want my partner to be happy. I don't want to hurt anyone, especially the people that I love. But I tend to attract people who think I'm going to cure their loneliness or be their manic pixie dream girl and... I'm not. I'm not saying I don't feel bad that it hurts people that I can't fill their void, but in the same way you don't ""get"" avoidants, I don't get how anyone could be comfortable with allowing another person so close as to try to merge that way. That's literally like my worst fear. And that is where avoidants and preoccupied personalities clash because what happens is that the fear of abandonment tends to lead to clinging and blurring of boundaries which is triggering for avoidants which tends to lead to us putting up walls or withdrawing. Honestly, the more you try to pull me toward you the more you can be sure I will not ever drop my guard. Maybe that looks like being unwilling to put in the work, but in my experience there's unwillingness on the other side to consider that what they're asking is unfair or perhaps is a need they need to meet on their own. BUT, sometimes people are just emotionally unavailable and that's a big red flag. 

I think trying to have a relationship with a person who is not self reflective or emotionally available, regardless of their default attachment style, is probably not likely to work out. But, though I am naturally avoidant, I have had 20 years of therapy and I am secure in pretty much all of my relationships and I think that there needs to be balance in order to achieve that in any relationship regardless of the attachment styles."
CPTSD,fnmx38j,t1_fnmvhge,1587079850.0,"I lean avoidant myself, but you nailed it with personal emotions being their own problem.

Everyone is entitled to their feelings, but I'm not obligated to wait around for someone else to figure themselves out and communicate properly, because in my experience the majority of the time this comes up is when there is passive aggression and that is harder to call out and set boundaries against because 99% of the time the person insists they aren't mad.

Or are so conflict avoidant that they can't admit it if you ask them. So, I've learned to trust myself because I don't have the same issue with assuming it's personal when it's not, however I recognize that is common for many people with CPTSD.

You can look more pulled together in almost anything if you throw on a pair of diamond (or CZ) studs, a nice scarf and some sunglasses on your head."
Meditation,fmb63h0,t1_fmb1qfa,1585919314.0,You might be onto something.
serialkillers,fm9bh92,t1_fm829dh,1585865376.0,"Yes, I agree. To me it's worse to chalk these things up to ""evil"" than it is to understand what causes it by looking at it with curiosity or empathy. Understanding and recognizing his upbringing as wrong is not the same as letting him off the hook. I find that black and white disregard for the nuance of a person (including those who do unspeakable things) as the whole person being bad through and through is essentially the mentality that can create this kind of severe dysfunction in the first place."
CPTSD,fm6b2d0,t1_fm5kckg,1585790139.0,"Same. I took the initial financial panic really hard, but now that I've accepted that I've done all I can on that front, I feel great being at home by myself. Such relief."
ArtistLounge,fm33j39,t3_fso4ne,1585711947.0,"I do pencil and charcoal portraits, I'd be interested in helping (but I'm getting in bed so I'm leaving this comment so I remember this thread tomorrow.)"
ptsd,fm2ydvc,t3_fspo6g,1585708347.0,My most joyful side is childlike and I embrace that. I think even in healthy people it's beautiful to keep our child spirit alive in that way.
CPTSD,flum6ks,t1_fludffm,1585505408.0,Yes.
Divorce,flkawdb,t1_fljvhmg,1585237436.0,This right here.
ptsd,flgjmwm,t1_flg57xc,1585144182.0,Yep. This.
Coronavirus,flcikxp,t1_flazno2,1585032261.0,"It's a good comparison, actually. So many people are dumbfounded as to how any half decent person can support him, but most people who have been in an abusive relationship can probably relate to not realizing what's happening or that you have any power to stop it, so you just keep trying to see the best in it because that's how it works. Trump is a massive gas lighter on top of it, so it further fuels the cycle of brainwashing."
ptsd,fl8al3s,t1_fl8a0g2,1584919377.0,"Definitely true, sometimes it's a surprise (good or bad.) Sorry for all you've been through, best wishes to you on your path to healing. Xo"
ptsd,fl84lef,t3_fn3ont,1584915754.0,"I'm not sure, either. It's crazy, our traumas are very different, but I relate so much to the things you've said. And yet, of course that's impossible, I can't really know what it was like for you just as you can't really know what it was like for me. And that's what I try really hard to remind myself of in times when it feels like no one gets it. People who are traumatized ""get it,"" we all get this fundamental experience of isolation and desperation that comes with trauma, but no one will ever understand exactly how it is for each of us because each of us is unique. People don't get it because they really don't get it- lucky for them- but it does lead to a lot of us feeling invalidated and misunderstood and I find it's best to avoid talking to those types of people about my pain. I think reaching out to others who can relate in some way, or at least listen actively and compassionately, is a great way to cope with these feelings. The people who fail to understand are lucky they have that option."
Divorce,fl81m6c,t3_fn53w0,1584913987.0,"Started making new friends, volunteered more, filled my home with art I love and made it ""mine"" instead of ""ours,"" applied to begin the process of foster care, took a class for a new certification (which I didn't end up using, but it was worth the shot). I feel like my ex and I had a pretty detached relationship by nature, so I always felt like my own person, but I leaned a lot into the stuff that is most important to me after the fact."
hsp,fkzbewn,t3_fl74jk,1584667089.0,"I relate to so much of what you wrote here. ðŸ–¤ especially about connecting and how others connect, that struck me deeply because it's something I say often."
AskWomen,fklaq7t,t3_fj3a1f,1584302204.0,"I accept people for who they are and accept myself for who I am and act accordingly. Being in love with someone, for me, doesn't mean I have to be with them. I know that's not the same for everyone, but for me it's easy to work through those feelings and build some other kind of friendship or relationship if I feel the connection is good in another way."
ptsd,fkkcm55,t3_fiu3v7,1584280623.0,"I hadn't thought of it, but yep, I'm pretty serene."
ptsd,fkkciw7,t1_fkjqq4y,1584280550.0,"I relate to this a lot. I've spent my whole life in therapy because I thought I was crazy, but now I'm seeing how far from true that is and how much it is just the willingness of others to avoid their neuroses and project them onto you if you admit you have a problem. It makes it a lot easier for everyone else to pretend they don't."
Endo,fkat5ha,t1_fkaqzr4,1584018836.0,"I never have tracked but reading your post I know it's also true for me. I always seem to have a spike in mood for the months following a surgery and then it gradually decreases over time. Even if my pain is mild, being in pain every day just wears the soul down."
AskWomen,fk9v5fs,t3_fh5uu6,1583984349.0,"I had my tubes removed after deciding to have a uterine ablation to curb bleeding. I had been through 2 years of infertility and knew I wouldn't be getting pregnant, but it is suggested as a precautionary measure."
