BPD,fpmcfld,t1_fpm038l,1588730057.0,Thanks
BPD,fpmc9r3,t1_fpm1ipo,1588729960.0,"Yeah he really doesn't but he says he's the victim, that I'm always wrong and I think I'm right so it's really stressful. 

Yeah I'll try to remain apathetic

Thanks"

Looks a lot bigger than I thought!"
chrome,fp65krm,t3_gbivcu,1588346481.0,"This is happening for me too.

What is it??"
BPD,foov7j8,t1_folrwu3,1587947162.0,No we don't see each other at all
BPD,folqqmh,t1_folor7h,1587868263.0,"We were friends for a few months then dated about 5 months when he told me I was his soul mate and I confessed I felt the same about him so about 7 months until that point. That's also the first time he told me he loved me around 7 months.

He became a little more distant since the quarantine come to think of it but it got stronger over the weeks. It started last month but this month was the worst. We've been together a little more than a year if you include our close friendship so about a year in until he started acting severely distant. He did act distant before on and off but it was mild in comparison and he had always been slightly distant here and there even when I first met him and he said he found it difficult to talk often."
BPD,folpt4z,t1_folhgv8,1587867639.0,"This makes perfect sense, wow, thank you. 

Yeah any time he was upset over anything at all whether with me, family or friends it's all he could think about. Like I remember this one time his cousin was supposed to visit his family for Christmas and he didn't like her so he told me he wasn't going to see his family for Christmas. I told him he needs to go and to just ignore her and he got really upset with me saying I didn't care about him when I did. His brother called and asked why he wasn't coming over and he got so angry with his brother that he ignored his texts and phone calls for a month telling me that his brother was insensitive to his feelings about his cousin. I knew this was far from the truth because he and his brother went on a road trip just days before the argument and he said they had the best time and was really excited to buy him something for his car for Christmas..it was so sudden. He even got upset with me for texting his brother on his behalf apologizing for not being able to make the Christmas party. But that ended after a month and they're best friends again although he has brought up that incident once for some reason.

He definitely doesn't seem to have a gray area, that's for sure. He's either upset with someone and retreats into his shell or he is really happy with them and thinks they're the greatest. He idolizes his brother again after putting him down over the Christmas incident. 

He's not in therapy yet so that's pretty devastating. I wish he was. 

Thanks for the help. I'm not sure if I should give him time alone and not reach out or talk as friends and see if that's best because overall everything was awesome with him but now it's like he's a ghost to me"
BPD,folnuro,t1_foli4fc,1587866350.0,"No because we were completely happy as a couple overall. We had a lot in common and most of the relationship was us laughing together having great times, having deep conversations and telling each other how amazing the other was. He always said I was his soul mate and I had agreed but unfortunately his bpd got in the way. His family loved him, I loved him, he loved my family, they loved him everything was great then he started talking less and became distant and I said we should talk more and that's when he got really annoyed with me and broke it off. He got annoyed with me over really small things before but it didn't last long. This happened with his friends and family too not just me so we were all used to it as we know he's very sensitive but I was always really relaxed with him so I don't know why this even happened."
BPD,folhb9y,t1_folg3pn,1587862224.0,Thanks
BPD,folhao2,t1_folh7ny,1587862213.0,I'm asking if it's possible for someone with BPD to be able to look back and see all the good times that's all
wehappyfew,fofi3y9,t1_fofdz7u,1587736373.0,"Oh okay, thanks"
wehappyfew,fofcoro,t3_g622pc,1587732816.0,Lol that does look like her
BPD,fo9ki39,t3_g60xws,1587622181.0,"May I ask where you are where you're not in quarantine? Why is he meeting up with friends when the entire world has COVID-19?


But it's normal for mental health issues. My boyfriend has bpd and depression and he never wants to do anything which is okay because I know he'll get better but he's the same way. He doesn't ever want to go anywhere other than in his car driving around aimlessly. That's literally all he does because he hates his house and he feels empty all the time. Once in a while he feels a little better though and we do things together and have a great time. I love him though so I can accept and understand it. It took a while though to fully grasp it as I wasn't used to it."
mentalillness,fnzom0p,t3_fnbomu,1587397980.0,"My mental health was so bad for an entire month during the virus. It wasn't the virus itself that was making me anxious and depressed but not having a known future of what's going to happen with my work and everything around me. It scared me and made me so stressed that I was becoming suicidal as the days went on but thankfully it stopped. 

The virus is serious though so we definitely can't disregard it as it had the potential to kill millions of people but I agree mental health is important for sure"
BPD,fny8gzg,t1_fny5ph2,1587356026.0,I know but I was hoping someone would have experienced something similar and could relate so I can get an idea but thanks
BPD,fny8dxo,t1_fny3zwd,1587355964.0,"Yeah maybe it's just impulsive and then regret. I'll try to just lay it all out and tell him I still love him and see what he says. I'm just scared lol

Thanks!"
BPD,fny8b33,t1_fny3mri,1587355907.0,"Maybe but I don't want to bring up the fight...I'm just scared because I don't want us to end but maybe I will just be direct

Thanks"
