You‚Äôre not having to worry about all the planning because the resort takes care of it for you. I‚Äôve heard costs can quickly add up though, depending on how many guests end up coming/how lavish you want the wedding. 

As another commenter said, a big reason for doing destination is to bring down the guest count. That‚Äôs initially why I wanted to do destination as well, because I know even the most important of people would have a hard time stomaching the cost. Ultimately what stopped me from doing destination is that I can‚Äôt imagine my wedding not at a Gurdwara. If it‚Äôs $160 on top of guests having to pay for flights I can‚Äôt see that going over very well. I would pay it, but I feel like a lot of people would not."
