Show that you are the adult your parents raised and work as hard to get to know her as you are working to get us to see your point. 

There will come a day, your 10 year old will begin dating and want to marry. What are you going to do when he decides to marry in, say,  3 mos? Kids do wacky things just like parents do, they are people who should be allowed to take a chosen partner without any input from you. My son is 12 - he's growing up and will move out. Is it going to be a bummer when he chooses to leave? Sure, but that will be an exciting day, just like the day he marries. He will marry HIS CHOICE, not mine and insta exactly how it should be. 

Be kind, you'll benefit from it over this stupid silent campaign.

EVERYONE! 

As for being positive, i'm pretty positive, but what really changed things for me... I'd been given a really bad review... really bad, unfairly. I work like a dog. So I was going back to work the next day after being super upset all night and someone said ""good morning honey!"" I was just pissed off and then I stopped and thought ""damn it, who am I to inflict my shit on someone else! This is kist a kind person i see every morning, being friendly."" So I stopped, turned around and genuinely said ""good morning how are you?"" I wasn't fake and i didn't talk more, but i felt a little better. Since then, i've worked really hard to do that with everyone. And over time, I did make a change. I'm much more positive now. Try it, it might help. 

As for being fun, why not take some classes in things you thought you would never or could never do.  I now take ballet and stand up comedy because I told myself I could never do either.  I'm not that great, but I have a darn good time! Try some improve or creative writing. Enjoy what you do and it will expand out.
