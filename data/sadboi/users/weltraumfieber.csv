personally i just lock myself away in a dark room, try to have fresh air and have it as cold as possible, make my hair wet (also to cool it) and use peppermint oil on my forhead, temples and neck, which also cools / cool-burns and males it easier to think.

also wrapping a bandana around my head to give it a bit of pressure, also at first making it wet and putting peppermint oil onto it so it cools/burns 

if the pain is too bad / my nausea is too bad the only solution for me is medication. tripans save my life (i find relpax is the most effective, but i am useless for hours after taking it, it really knocks you out). i try to take triptans as rarely as possible, as sadly where i'm from i can only get one prescription of it per visit at the doctors office, and it only has 6 pills / 3 when it os the higher dosage, and i dont want  to run out :/ else i would probably just take it everytime, because i lose so mich time just lying around"

anorexia has almost nothing to do with the current weight you have. i knew anorexics who started out overweight and starved themselves down in unhealthy ways. that is when one has to catch it! when people are underweight enough to get the 'proper anorexia' diagnosis it is often too late, or so late that recovery is harder and takes so much longer because the behaviour is already so set and the mind is already so set on these thoughts.
