AskReddit,fpt5j5q,t3_gf7x37,1588885224.0,My Dad (a doctor in the U.K.) was on a flight many years ago where the captain made an announcement asking for a doctor. A passenger was incredibly ill and despite best effort my dad was unable to save him. He had suffered a major heart attack and they were hours from landing so nothing could be done unfortunately. My dad commented on the professionalism of the airline staff. He was used to seeing very ill people and inevitably people who did not survive their illness but he said the airline staff were amazing. They were calm and did their best under the circumstances to clear an area of the plane for the man’s family to be cared for for the remainder of the journey.

AskReddit,fhryf31,t3_f4gsxv,1581844685.0,"The first thing to know is when I was a child I was a brat. Not spoilt I was just awful. Tantrums. Shouting. Stomping. Door slamming. 
I was about 11 and it was bonfire night. I wanted my mum to buy fireworks. She wouldn’t. It was quite late so I’m not sure where I expected her to get them but as a brat didn’t think these things through. I went for a compromise of sparklers but she wasn’t having that either. So que typical stomping and slamming. Now I had slammed my door countless times with no issue. It had a frosted glass top and solid bottom. This was years before safety glass. 
As I pushed the door frame my hand slipped and I ploughed it through the glass part. A moment of silence then a sea of red as the glass had broken leaving a large piece sticking out of my hand. 
Fortunately my mum was a nurse so she knew what to do. Off to A&E where they removed the glass and stitched my hand back together. I Have had a lovely scar stretching across my hand for the last 30 years. 
A week later all the doors in the house were replaced with fully wooden ones.
Worth nothing it didn’t stop the tantrums or me being a brat."

EatingDisorders,ffwhl5r,t3_evl99p,1580301271.0,Because everyone is different. Don’t judge your progress by the progress of others. Your doing great and doing it at a pace that is right for you. I had an eating disorder in my late teens. Ignored it. Convinced myself it wasn’t one. Then 2 years ago (I’m 40 now) bam. Hit me like a freight train. Lost 5 stone in as many months and thought it was ok until my best friend sat me down and showed me what I was doing. How I’ll I looked. I hadn’t properly recovered in my teens as I had brushed it under the carpet and ignored it. I Hadn’t taken the time to look at myself. Understand what I was doing and why so your doing the right thing. Take it easy and don’t put a timescale on your recovery. You will get there. I’m 18 months into my recovery this time and I’m taking it at my pace so that this time I can recover and be happy and healthy.
EatingDisorders,ffwfwks,t3_evld64,1580299538.0,As the person above has said the answer to the question is no. Eating disorders come in many forms. If you aren’t eating a balanced diet I would suggest trying this as a first step. Speak to your doctor or medical professional about your concerns. I believe weed increases your bodies need for sugar as it does something to the metabolism so if you have increased how much you smoke this could increase your cravings for certain foods which our bodies can store in different ways rather than burn them in day to day life. Also be aware that your still growing at your age and your body will change its shape as you develop. Try not to get too focussed on weight as you should get heavier as you mature until you stop growing. Easier said than done but just try to be healthy with food and exercise.

I just chuck meat, veg, beans and healthy things in with some herbs and gravy then he spends the day smelling it cook.

Explain that when you react or act like that it’s a symptom of what you have not who you are. My boyfriend feels awful after he gets snappy or has a go but I know it’s not him so I just sit. Let him vent. I don’t react or retaliate and he calms down. I Want to add, just incase some one misunderstands, he’s never been physical in his outbursts. The fact he’s explained it to me means I am able to recognise what’s happening and sort of put in in a box and ignore it. I don’t let it hurt me and I don’t question his love towards me because I fully understand what’s happening and his illness."

bipolar,ev7t853,t3_cikjq6,1564264059.0,"Firstly I think the coworker who spoke to you should be commended as it’s not easy to be honestIn what could be an awkward conversation.  I also think that knowing that there is genuine care for you from other coworkers is a really good thing. 
In terms of them being scared. Perhaps it’s scared for you rather than of you. It may have just been worded badly. Unless your jokes are things about hurting other people in which case I would reign those ones in as if anyone repeatedly joked about killing me I’d be scared! 

Workplace jokes are a minefield at the best of times as even in small teams the variety of what people find funny is going to be vast and what some find funny others won’t. 

I would say gauge the crowd. As with any kind of joke. Don’t feel awkward for being yourself but also your coworkers shouldn’t feel awkward for being themselves either and having differing comedy expectations so I would say try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
You aren’t going to please them all. Or make them all laugh so don’t put that expectation on yourself. 

Also. I say good on you for holding down a job whilst going through a tough time. I hope you have given yourself some positive recognition for that as it is not easy."
