The reason I liked it is because it's realistic. It's not a doomsday article. It looks at the situation from a very realistic angle.  So, click with caution, but I will leave some quotes that I really liked about it. 

Summary: how covid is spread and why contact tracing is so important to understand how covid moves. 


""with each infected individual transmitting the virus to between two¬†and three¬†others on average. But the *important point, which is often missed, is that this is just an average. In the real world, most people transmit the disease to nobody*.""


""People think if you get exposed, you automatically get sick or become infectious, he explains. But even people exposed to sick family members in their homes don‚Äôt always get sick.""


""People passing by you in a supermarket are unlikely to infect you. Outdoor environments appear much safer as well. In one¬†study, which followed hundreds of cases, all but one transmission occurred indoors.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like people to stop wasting mental energy on the wrong things,‚Äù Bromage says. ‚ÄúTo stop worrying about outdoors and bike riders since it‚Äôs such a low risk.‚Äù

Bromage doesn‚Äôt think strict lockdowns have to remain until we get herd immunity or a vaccine. But he would like to see businesses use the data available to start up without fueling major outbreaks. He sees hope for restaurants and hair salons in the new normal""


Here's probably my favorite quote from this:

""20th century doctors eventually relented on advice for unpaired people to remain celibate until there was a cure for AIDS. They started talking about safer sex. Now it‚Äôs time to do the same with life under the coronavirus."""

On top of that, most states/countries are much better equipped to handle this outbreak than a month and a half ago. More testing, which is huge (and in my personal opinion, the key to preventing the spread). They'll be able to identify hot spots and quarantine that area rather than the whole state. On top of that, hospitals are better equipped and ready to face a surge (at least my hospital is). 

Society as a whole as a better understanding. 

There's more understanding of covid and they're approving drug treatments for those that are critically ill, and we're just going to keep learning more and more as each day passes. 

So, no. I don't think we'll ever go back to the same level of quarantine that we've just been through.

With that said, none of the nursing staff who works with the covid-19 patients have contracted it. I haven't contracted it. None of my coworkers have contracted it. What I'm trying to say with this post, is just because someone around you has covid DOES NOT mean that you're automatically going to get it. 

This doesn't change the fact that you and I should all be vigilant in our hand washing, social distancing and not touching our faces (the hardest one to follow, in my opinion). It doesn't mean we can all gather in a big group or throw caution to the wind. We still need to be doing all the things the health officials are saying.
 
But what I am saying is that if you hear of someone in your work place/neighborhood/apartment building who has had tested positive for covid, try not to panic. If you've been following all of the guidelines health officials are putting out (including wearing masks) then your chances of contracting it are pretty low.

As far as working your way back to running. Try doing a fast walk on the treadmill and slowly add incline week by week. If you do it outside, try to add hills to your walks. After you get comfortable with the fast walk/incline, then try doing a slow jog at the end of your walks for 5-10 minutes at a time at level ground and slowly start increasing your running time each week by 2-5 minutes.

AskDocs,fjuk44j,t3_ff1zup,1583617568.0,"Not a doctor, but I have my degree in Exercise Science and work as an exercise physiologist. My best guess would be that you're body isn't used to working out. 

When people do fast up/down motions, sometimes the blood has a hard time getting back up into the head. When there's a lack of blood in the head, you get dizzy.

The best way to combat that is to keep exercising, but if you start to feel that come on again, stop immediately. You're young enough that there shouldn't be anything to worry about. If this continues to happen after the next month after you've been exercising on a regular basis, then go see a doctor."

My first recommendation still stands, go get help. If mentally you're struggling, then you're going to physically struggle as well."

Plus, they're not beat or tortured to go buck. If the animal doesn't want to buck then they don't buck, simple as that. 
On top of that, you cannot compare these animals to humans. They're not. They don't have the same level of consciousness as us. With that statement, in no way am I saying that the animals don't have any feelings or any consciousness, it's just their consciousness is different from ours. It's primal."

It is not your responsibility to make sure she's ok. It is your responsibility to make sure you're ok. It sounds like she's manipulating you so she can stay longer. 

What I would do is give her a week or two notice that she needs to move out. Say if she's not out by this date then you'll be getting the police involved."

These cattle companies don't want to put their cattle in harm's way because they make a ton of money off of them. The healthier the bull, the better they perform. Most of the cattle you see in rodeos have very good lives outside of the rodeo."
