relationship_advice,f6pfvcn,t3_dsi23k,1573055427.0,"First of all, don't take her to the movies on a first date. Coffee or lunch/dinner is good, or even to a park. Just talk to her and find out her interests and tell stories. Eye contact is very important. And LISTEN."
relationship_advice,f62csgs,t3_dqddyy,1572657085.0,"Omg I'm literally going through the same situation.... Me and this girl have been texting like we're bestfriends. Then one day idk what happened it was like a switch, she just texted with short replies or it would take a whole day. Maybe you and I said something wrong? I literally can't figure it out either... I don't think you're overthinking it, you can probably feel that he's not talking to you like he used to at first... It sucks :( Goodluck though, maybe he just needs space"
dating_advice,f5qwzhj,t3_dowiw7,1572384456.0,This is such a norm in the U.S. and I hate it. In the UK it's very normal for the women to approach guys and not looked down upon on at all. If you like somebody then just go for it!
depression,f4sugu1,t3_dlfw2v,1571781016.0,"I hate physical pain so as much as I don't want to exist anymore, I can't get myself to wish for a horrible accident or anything like that.

dating_advice,f2o1klc,t3_ddvsnu,1570321991.0,"As a completely oblivious guy when it comes to being able to tell if a girl is flirting or being friendly with me; I've had a few experiences I thought to me was a simple compliment, turned out to be a way of her saying she was interested in me. I'd say just ask for his number. Or better yet, ask if he'd like to have coffee together sometime."
relationship_advice,f2ajr6d,t3_dcrs39,1570114195.0,"3 months into the relationship and you're already saying ""I love you"" like it's nothing. That was probably a turn off for her. Or maybe she's just not that into you, sorry mate."

relationship_advice,ezl1c1h,t3_d1f94y,1567970108.0,"He probably wants to become bestfriends with you first. And eventually take you swimming to see the real you. Lol jk.
But for real, I think he sees a future with you and does want to invest time onyou and be 100% sure he's not wasting or both of your times. 4 dates isn't enough to really get to know someone. So don't worry :)"

For me, if my gf made out with another girl, I see that as an opportunity for a possible threesome in the future lul. But no honestly, I think they were just having too much fun, and at least she didn't think of kissing another guy which would hurt me way more if that happened."

relationship_advice,epxnrrx,t3_bwhrt4,1559605847.0,Should never talk about an ex unless using them as a reference imo. Sounds like your new SO is obviously not over his ex. And that means he's still constantly thinking about the ex if it keeps being brought up.
