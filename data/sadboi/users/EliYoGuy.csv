Good news is your so young that you got so much to live for, you can choose what type of career you want and have time to make mistakes in order to find success. Make today (or tomorrow) the day that you’re going to find your passion and pursue it to your fullest, in other words replace death with life by living it to the max. Find a reason to live to the point it don’t even matter when you’ll die because at least you’ll have no regret and live a legacy behind."

In fact most likely if she was to find out how you feel about her, she probably would wonder why as what she’s doing anyone have the potential if they put in the work.
