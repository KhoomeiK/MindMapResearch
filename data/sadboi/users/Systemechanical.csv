I get like that all the time where the smallest thing triggers me and I almost go ape shit to all my friends. It is good to try and show him a more optimistic and realistic reality, to help him/(or her idk) get out of their negative funk, but criticizing him/her and making them feel bad about it will only make them hate themselves more.

losgrowlers,f88arqy,t1_f88a21i,1574351534.0,"You’re very right! To my understanding, the old drummer Scott Montoya, was also their sound engineer and their OG like old days bass player, then they got the offer to be engineered by Julian I THINK for City Club, I wanna day Scott still did Chinese Fountain and maybe Julian did a couple of tracks. But yeah Scott wasn’t a fan of that, and he was just gone, no explanation at all, there were some rumors on the internet that it was hostile and the Growlers themselves never ever even mentioned his name after that. Also after Chinese Fountain, their used to be current bass player started his own band where he’s the guitarist, I think he also had a big influence on their sound. So City Club was the first big change, different band members and they even added a keyboardist instead of it being Kyle(rhythm) idk how much of this you knew I’m not trying to be annoying w knowledge I just was REALLY obsessed before all this, and I was just so keen on finding out wtf happened and why it stopped, Hope this was interesting

It puts me down too sometimes seeing that people with solid support groups, can get lifted back up on their feet, because they have a plethora of people to notice them changing and getting worse and influence them before it gets worse, and for some it’s a girlfriend or boyfriend, but for us who have no one really, we have to pay a therapist so we can talk about it once a week. And it’s just different that way, and it’s not fair, I wish people understood that if you could get out of this you could be great. I know you could be great man, I hope you can at least remember, the time in your life maybe when you were younger when you did and hopes and aspirations, not in anguish, but to remember that you’re capable of feeling like you should be here, and that you have something to do with your life, it’s not easy and it’s not guaranteed, but I hope you can see it again one day"

lonely,f83jixb,t1_f83j44c,1574213435.0,"I relate to this completely, it’s a strange dynamic how by putting effort into being polite you lose the opportunity for people to judge you even positively.
