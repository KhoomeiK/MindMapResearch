So, even though you likely already know this, your disordered eating is completely valid and deserving of the same level of attention and concern as anyone else‚Äôs. 

In terms of learning to trust food again, I have a different sort of ‚Äútrust issue,‚Äù related more to other people screwing with my food than to my body rejecting certain foods, but I guess it sums up similarly as food= poison. What it‚Äôs been for me - and I‚Äôm by no means over this completely - has been taking ownership of my own food and what I eat. So for me that means preparing my own foods from scratch to as great an extent as possible (which is its own issue, but at least I‚Äôm eating), and for you I‚Äôd imagine it might be something similar coupled with really hammering down the foods that your body can and can‚Äôt tolerate. It sucks not eating pre-prepared foods sometimes, but it reduces that anxiety and lack of trust, at least for me.

EDAnonymous,fjpjxoy,t3_fepfc4,1583552815.0,"Ok. So first you have to breathe, and then you have to try to gain a bit of perspective. It takes 3,000 calories, give or take, to produce a single pound of fat. So, say that you consumed 6,000 calories - the absolute most you could gain would be two pounds, which would suck but would not be undoable. 

That said, if you consumed 6,000 calories you will not gain two pounds of fat. Say that you are a 25 years old female of average height and weight who is lightly active - you likely burn something like 1,500 calories per day just in metabolic processes. So now you‚Äôre at a net of 4,500 calories, which could yield only as much as 1.5 pounds of gain. Then bring into mind any activity you do and the fact that your body is not a perfect machine and does not utilize every calorie you put into it - much of what you ate will likely go unprocessed. 

And so. Yes, you will likely feel bloated and unpleasant for a day or two, and you may gain a very small amount of weight, temporarily (or not, if you so choose!).  But none of this is catastrophic, irreversible, or permanent. You will be OK, and this is also a good opportunity to consider other, healthier coping mechanisms for a future similar situation!

I know it‚Äôs hard and it sucks, but you will get through it!

This city in general is really unkind to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have boatloads of money, and I should probably just leave."
AskReddit,fgqx8sa,t1_fgq130z,1581033409.0,"Oh hey fellow Ashevillain, here‚Äôs some backup that this is 100% a thing. I was briefly without housing and nowhere would let me stay. In early February. Not even close to tourist season, and they all had multiple vacancies. I didn‚Äôt look homeless, I was polite, I had a credit card ready to go. No dice. So I slept under the overpass and got all my shit stolen.  Fuck hotels here."
AdviceAnimals,fgodhs4,t1_fgo00wh,1580966413.0,"Your cat is likely difficult to handle, as cats often are - it might take ten minutes per test. So that‚Äôs an hour of two techs‚Äô time - one to hold, one to prick. Call it $30. Six test strips could cost $10, especially if one need to be redone, which is likely given how cooperative cats tend to be. Your cat is taking up a cage as well, and requires occasional check-ins and attention - call that $50 for day boarding and brief checks. You‚Äôll also almost certainly have an exam, given that your cat is here because it‚Äôs ill. A reasonable exam fee is, say, $50.  Now we‚Äôre at $140, with zero profit for the clinic. Let‚Äôs call it $160 so they can keep the lights on. 

Now, how much do you value the expertise and time of your vet?  He or she went to school for 8-9 years for this, and is doing something for your cat that you cannot effectively do yourself, possibly providing a diagnosis, maybe doing additional research, and then developing a treatment plan and maki recommendations to keep your pet well. That, to me, would be worth $140. 

There‚Äôs your $300 - and I guarantee that, without insurance, the exact same thing would be IMMENSELY more expensive for a human (at least in the states).  

PS get decent pet insurance, and you‚Äôll pay somewhere in the range of $60 for those tests.  You‚Äôll be better off, and your vet will be a whole lot happier too if they don‚Äôt have to listen to you whine."

DecidingToBeBetter,fg8evfj,t3_exid4w,1580617438.0,"I have literally never noticed someone being alone at the movies, even though I know a lot of people do it. People are paying attention to the movie, not to the other people watching it."
EDAnonymous,fg8dhmd,t3_exif1m,1580616306.0,"I feel your pain from the other side of things - my healthy BMI was still within the ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù range, just because of my bone structure and overall build, but even though this had been established by a physician previously my treatment team refused to bring any subjectivity to the situation and insisted that I had to be at a higher weight than was objectively healthy for me. Fucking sucks. And anyway, BMI is a ridiculously awful indicator of health. The criteria for anorexia no longer states specific percentages or numbers to be met in order to be diagnosed, largely for this reason."

It WAS rape, and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ignorant or an idiot. What happened to you was real, and your feelings about it are valid.

I‚Äôm not sure about in Mexico, but elsewhere that would still be legally considered rape, though unfortunately getting anything done in any legal system is often difficult. 

It sounds like the environment you‚Äôre in is not a supportive one - is there any possibility of you transferring to a university in a larger city, where you‚Äôd likely find a more progressive and helpful mindset?"

Seriously though, just hydrate if you can, splurge some calories on Gatorade or there are these electrolyte powders I use that are pretty decent, they‚Äôre from Pedialyte and only 50cals I think. Plus I take potassium tabs just for good measure üò¨"
