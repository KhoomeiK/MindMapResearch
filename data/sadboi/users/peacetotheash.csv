I think it's naivety for sure and probably a lifetime of believing patriarchal bullshit but i don't sympathize because you can educate yourself, anytime. I understand that women are pressured but pressure is not the same as being forced. Rejecting that kind of pressure is what makes you strong (part of it at least) and i think anytime a woman wants to wake up, she can. Women are not sad little helpless things to be manipulated. We've got to understand her agency in all of this. On top of that she's perpetuating exactly what she played into. Believing the facade leads to creating the facade. But either way im gonna get downvoted to hell lol it's already started. Anyway, you can have all the sympathy u want for her giving into record label pressure, but i don't. I guess im expecting a bit too much. Respectfully agree to disagree."

No judgement, but im not going to feel sorry for someone who chooses to alter their bodies (botched or not) in exchange for the price of stardom or for the price of anything for that matter. I personally dont think that women need to alter their bodies for the male gaze (controversial, i know) in order to gain notoriety. If she hadnt done all that or simply didnt sign with Young Money and instead went about obtaining fame another way, she may have still made comparable achievements. Who knows, but she made a willing choice so the point is, that was her price..

I think people do care because underneath all of our emotions we care about ourselves.

I think I had been / I am going through a very similar situation based on what you've described and *I don't think I even realized it.*  That may be why I've been having trouble staying in touch with people or seeing any of my old friends or making any new ones.  I used to say it was because he isolated me, which he did, but now I find I'm isolating myself.  I was in a very abusive relationship for 9 years on and off but mostly on.  Got out of that somehow, I just disappeared one day and that was it. About 2 years passed, then got with another guy for about a year and left bc he was extremely violent.

In those two years in between there were months on end where I didn't do anything.  I mean I wouldn't even want to walk through the living room to use the bathroom because I didn't want to see my roommates and have to engage with them.  I went through a time when I thought everything, literally everything was just too much. I'd get texts and not have the energy to text back a simple hello, even texts from my mom.  I developed this fear almost, coupled with nawing anxiety when I even thought of interacting with people  I just couldn't handle it; I was just too tired and too mistrusting.

Lately, I've been forcing myself (not saying that you should, just something I've been trying).  It's been working though, I mean I've really been forcing myself to engage with people (I even made a new friend!) and I've been having some fun and starting to feel like me again (not that I'm sure who she is lol)  I've gone to music events and reconnected with family (cousins that are around my age) I guess you can call it exposure therapy. Using this site has helped a lot as well.  I'm back in therapy, with a new doctor and she's helping too.  And last but not least...I'm keeping a Gratitude Journal. Just 5 things (or however many I can think of) that I am grateful for.  Sounds super corny but it is helping (I got the idea from Oprah).  I'm not great at doing it every single day but as much as I can.  Today you and your post will be in my Gratitude Journal.  Just be diligent and have faith that you will heal and you will get better.  I didn't realize I had faith until writing this right now.

Thank you *(and sorry for the short book)*"
