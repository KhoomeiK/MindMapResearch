I don't support farms, but this is not the way to go. Grow up and let's have a reasonable conversation."" The farm page liked my comment and agreed with me. Supposedly the page was deleting all vegans comments, but then I realized it was because of the content of the comments not the fact that they were vegans.

The next day I had other vegans in my inbox shitting on me. Radicals ruin everything for everyone, it didn't really bother me too much but these are the vocal people who represent veganism, and it would be understandable why people would oppose veganism.

If I'm with a group of guys I tend to forget even if they know since I just get treated like one of the guys.

Generally I'm most conscious of my transness when I'm with women, since they've had a tendency to treat me differently and in the past I've been used as their trans/gay friend and tend to infantilize me. I still get treated as some girls gay friend even though I've said multiple times I'm bi with a preference to women. I've been living mostly as male (just not at home) since I was around 12-13 years old and I really can't relate to a lot of the teenage girl experiences but somehow I'm expected to relate to those experiences by some women.

However I'm still friends with a good group of girls I've known since middle school who are all LGBT and they don't do that shit to me. I love them and I really appreciate how they just see me for me. Sometimes I forget I'm trans around them too.
