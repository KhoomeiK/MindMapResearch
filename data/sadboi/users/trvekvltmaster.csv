I dont believe meat will be banned at once. 500 grams of meat, weekly is the reccommended amount and most people eat much more. Likely we will first approach that, and gradually reduce. Meat will never be completely gone from the market but i wish it will decrease. It is a large industry yes, but so was slavery, and all the jobs that are taken over by automation.

Just by existing. It is impossible to do no harm. But there is a difference between harm that is easily avoidable like the harm caused by consuming animal products, fast fashion and other such things. I find it strange that you say it might be too expensive to go vegan,  but then bring up pesticides and cotton, when those are way more expensive to replace with organic/ethical products. Veganism is the least you can do. 

People can learn to make their own meat replacements from easily available, cheap products like beans, lentils, soy, vwg, etc. if they feel like they are desperately missing out on the cultural and social aspects of eating. You can find the menu and phone number of most restaurants online, to ask if they have vegan meals. And someone who is so poor they can't afford soy curls, would not go to a restaurant anyway. Beyond  and impossible are not the only substitutes available (and one of them isn't even considered vegan because of animal testing, but ive never had them). 

When going to a friends house, bring your own snack or inform them, it's not that weird to ask.. you're friends after all. 

I don't believe in gatekeeping, but someone who eats beef burgers with fake cheese isn't actually helping anything. For that animal that is on his burger right now, that decision did matter.
