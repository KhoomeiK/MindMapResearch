AmItheAsshole,fnmqzdb,t3_g2gh5m,1587076489.0,"YTA. You didn't really handle the situation like an adult. How hard is it to ask for another menu really? Making a scene??? Grow a spine and stop being ridiculous, if the waiter had a problem with you asking for another menu then that entire restaurant is filled with idiots. Fact is there's 2 paying customers in the restaurant and asking for a menu with prices is far from an unreasonable request."

SebDerm,f9eqv5l,t3_e4qmiy,1575249147.0,"Yes, the hair will most likely come back when the Seb derm goes away, but to make sure that it's not Seb derm plus male pattern balding you should take a look at some videos to identify male pattern balding and see if that's ur case. Some things will be hair loss at the crown, ur hair line will recede, etc. Seb derm usually only causes hair loss tho when you pick at/scratch it too much and I know it's really hard not to but look for medication. Ketzonacole 2%is a pretty good over the counter measure, but make sure you're applying it right cuz I wasnt for a long time, as in leave it in for 5 mins at least, you'll definitely feel it's presence in your scalp, and increase the frequency of use if needed. A decent routine that worked for me was day 1, putting mustard oil in my hair at night before bed, then day 2,  showering in the morning, using the same shampoo or selsun blue to just get the oil out of my hair really quickly and then doing the 5mins of keto, don't put both in ur hair for 5 mins tho cuz then ur scalp can get dry easily, day 3 rest, then repeat. Increase the frequency if needed. Also helps to see a doctor but they're probably just gonna tell u to use Ketzonacole or prescribe a decently expensive steroid shampoo. Best of luck"
