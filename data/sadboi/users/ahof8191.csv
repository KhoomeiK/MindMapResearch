Only very small children and elderly people are considered to be in grave danger from a bite. That said, it’s not a fun experience. Black widows also only release their venom about half the time, if that. I wouldn’t consider them a major threat or deterrent from living here."

Theres definitely no blanket way to improve this situation as its never really happened before, and four year olds can be extremely versatile in their understanding of serious situations like this. I'd recommend maybe sitting down with the three of you, and talking about how her dad has a really, really important job to go help people, but he misses her all day, and you and her are helping him do a really important job by listening to you and getting plenty of sleep. Maybe talk about some ideas that would help you guys get through the day, like activities she wants to do. Like, ""I miss daddy too, but while he's at work helping people, why don't we make a painting/cookies/drawing that he can see when he gets home?""  When my five year old nephew's mom went back to work, he stayed with grandma all day and there was a huge adjustment curve. My SIL made a video recording of herself for him saying that she's at work, she misses him, but she was helping people and that he was being really brave, or something along those lines. If he was starting to spiral, usually just after dropping him off, Grandma would let him watch mom's video, and then they moved on with their day. It worked for the most part I think. 

I'm not sure if any of this will be helpful because I don't have kids and have limited experience, but I hope it helps you a little. Kids are resilient, and she'll adjust. Luckily, this thing isn't going to last forever and you all will be able to get back to a normal schedule. You sound like an amazing person, and you'll get through this!"

New York’s CFR (just based off Worldometers) seems to be somewhat low for the amount of cases they have, and I believe it’s not as difficult to get tested in NY (especially NYC), though I could be totally wrong. I’ve read a couple posts on here the past few days about some real mild cases."
COVID19positive,fm22ifv,t3_fsklv2,1585689429.0,I’m so glad to read that you’re feeling all better! It’s nice to read a case of someone who made it through with a seemingly mild case. Enjoy your unquarantined freedom!

COVID19positive,fly918g,t1_fly8l5i,1585597768.0,Thanks for your response - also an asthmatic with a slightly sore throat trying not to panic. I hope you continue to feel on the mend and that this passes for you! :)
