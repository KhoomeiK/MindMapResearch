depression,fopiip7,t3_g8eq07,1587962388.0,"My girlfriend was also murdered at 19, it was absolutely the hardest thing I’ve ever been thru. I don’t want to say anything like it’ll get better because I’m sure u’ve heard too many times b4. It’s true but I don’t need to say what’s probably been said to u a million times already, I’ve been there and I know hearing that eventually starts to hurt too. I just want u to know that there’s someone out there who understands ur pain because I always felt so alone in my situation. Something like this changes your whole life and will also change you more than anything else you’ve probably been thru up to this point but that’s not necessary a bad thing. Loosing her was the worst thing that ever happened to me but I think it’s made me a better person. The healing process made me more caring and loving in general. I think going through loss like this gives a special appreciation of life. I think that’s what her mom meant by her living through you and I also think there’s some truth in that. The experiences and memories we shared with them will always be with us. Now when I think of her there’s still a sadness but it also makes me thankful that I got to have her love in my life. I don’t know if any of this helps but I think hearing this would have helped me during the worst of it. I really wish you the best through all of this, I might be a stranger on the other side of the world but I know one day you’ll be able to see the beauty in  life even after everything that’s happened."
