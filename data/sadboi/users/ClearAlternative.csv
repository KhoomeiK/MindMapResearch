Disliking black coats is so bizarre! They're such a classic staple, really not offensive or boring at all. I forgot to add, I also noticed she only likes very short skirts/dresses, she was trying on some things in a video and she found them too long (an above the knee skirt which was short already, but she'd have preferred it shorter, and a midi). She equates long to old, which I disagree with too."

I did notice she made a remark on jeans, I can't remember it verbatim, but it was about jeans being lazy/slobbish, that wearing jeans shows no effort or something, which seems a bit rude? I love dressing up but how could you come to that conclusion re jeans? Who doesn't like jeans from time to time?! And I hadn't heard her comments on black tights until reading it here, but that's another daft one IMO. She seems to have an aversion for anything that isn't white/cream/pale pink. I don't understand having such tunnel vision for clothing and accessory choices. 

I'm envious of her bedroom and dressing room space, though. I'd love something like that, with all that storage and light, in London, too.

Yes he has gone down on me, and rubs my clit when he is inside but I’ve never came with anything inside me. I tighten up a lot on orgasm, I’ve been close with him inside but it feels very very tight and I’m wondering if it’s going to be possible, it’s like a different sensation."

I think your last point is right and I never thought of it that way before. About it being about him and not me. 

I agree that it’s very likely to not happen when there’s the pressure on me.

As much as I’d like to be younger again I wouldn’t want to be in this day and age.

I think the world is getting worse and it feels like there’s no way back, it’s gone too far. And it’s only going to get worse. PC was going mad back then too but now it takes the cake. So much nonsense. 

I spend a lot of time wishing it was still the 00s. Sometimes I like to pretend it is which I know sounds a little crazy...! 

And I agree about music - I know it’s all personal tastes, but in my opinion, there is very little to no decent new music anymore. I find the chart music tuneless, and the artists talentless. I don’t listen to anything current, and tend to live in the past in that way too."
