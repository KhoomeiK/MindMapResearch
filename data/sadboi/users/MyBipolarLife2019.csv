Rather than thinking of dx‚Äôs I would think of the symptoms you‚Äôre struggling with and how to counter them. Like for schizo it‚Äôs important to keep yourself busy as possible to stay out of your head and sometimes music helps (headphones). Delusions and psychosis is so tricky to deal with but what helps me is to have things that remind me who I am and what is real (letters, accomplishments, or whatever reminds you of you).

Most people only feel one or two of those and for not very long at all! We are always changing. You‚Äôll find you‚Äôre way home. Sending love and happy thoughts your way before I drift into a soft slumber. Be kind to yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I have been active in the mental illness communities here on Reddit and the energy work groups here. 

Where is the line drawn? Why does it matter? 
Some people experience life different than others. Some people can afford treatment. Others want organic treatment when they notice something out of the norm. Some seek enlightenment in their struggles and in life in general. What matters is both communities have a common goal of making life more manageable.

Energy work involves alternate work/ therapy, strategies, etc. This involves mental, physical, and spiritual work.

Everyone has something they‚Äôre dealing with on a daily basis. It‚Äôs hard to understand that someone‚Äôs ‚Äúscratch‚Äù could be a gushing wound to them but in your eyes it‚Äôs a very very small scratch.

addiction,f1msfag,t3_d9v4x8,1569601111.0,"Karty, as a young adult who has overcome addiction and is currently at the end of nicotine addiction/ beginning of recovery I would like to say something. Everyone has their own world without any sense of anyone else whether you like it or not. Otherwise we would not have opinions and our own ways. I suggest you work on yourself rather than be angry and try to scold your son. This will only make matters worse, push him away, possibly causing the addiction to deepen. This would certainly upset any caring parent I‚Äôve known. I suggest leading by example and you can very passively do so in ways that can change his life. Things that have helped me most regarding my parents helping me through struggling times ( I would think most can relate) are through stories of experience. These are our strongest words and best way to lead by example. Hence my name I have struggled with mental illness to the point of collapse. My father was broken in result, probably very similar to how you feel currently. However. Something sparked in me one day when he was trying to solve my mania crisis. He is an engineer that has worked with computers his entire life and I am very very technologically oriented as well. He told me a story about how the company he worked with had an issue with server speed. He said that the server was not operating as fast as it should. At the time it was not well known that even computers when working together will actually create better processing power. He told me this in such a way that even though the computers slowed each other down in a way by working together, in return the output of the server ultimately was much faster. This story was out of context but the reason I tell it here is because it made me realize the possibility that, slowing down could be more beneficial to me. 

You have skills, stories, experiences, among other resources that you can and must use to help him. But you must always be patient. He who needs help must first be willing to let go of what is hurting him. 

Good luck with your son I am confident together you will figure this out."

bipolar,f1c1suo,t1_f1bzcq2,1569347973.0,"This is a good term. The only negatives are those who get fixated on the positives and therefore dismiss the negatives of their diagnosis. I relate by having moments of grandiosity that distract me and I must pull myself in.

At some point I will take my next step and tell people that I have bipolar disorder openly instead of just depression. It‚Äôs so sad I feel like I must do that but I do not think I‚Äôve met anyone without bipolar who would comprehend it without a lengthy discussion which is hard to do these days since everyone wants to go so fast. I usually tell my closest friends and experiment with it, but at my age, and in my experience of shitty friends they eventually use it against me which I Never forget. Not so much a grudge but more of a decrease in respect and value of my friendship with them. I am strong but highly sensitive, I do not think I am quite ready to openly approach strangers with my disorder. To be honest before I was diagnosed I thought bipolar people were mean and high tempered. I was young though so I did not understand labels are invalid."

I‚Äôve wanted to do this as my inpatient facility invited me to return to visit them, although I feel like this is in a way a scare tactic. Probably a paranoia thought though.

I am working on changing from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bipolar‚Äù to ‚ÄúI have bipolar disorder‚Äù although I‚Äôve said it many many times. When first diagnosed, as you stated I was treated by peers and adults and often insulted by being labeled as ‚Äújust a bipolar person, acting bipolar‚Äù."
bipolar,f1aeuju,t1_f1aembk,1569292127.0,I would be wrong to disagree. You‚Äôve made a valid point. Help me in spreading this positive message by helping me come up with a better terminology to use!

BipolarReddit,f1aem8a,t1_f1adk4y,1569291954.0,"To some it may not be hurtful. To those who are highly sensitive, it is though. I am one of these people, I‚Äôve been sensitive my entire life thanking people at a very young age with very little education/ mentoring to do so. So intuitively I picked up on empathy at a young age and am forever stuck this way. Yes I can take drugs or drink to dull my brain, but why would I? Diagnosis by definition, means condition or status of something. Usually correlating to something medical or scientific. Maybe separation from the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù separation, is exactly what this world needs. 

You may disagree, to each their own. These are my views. Thank you for your input/feedback, I enjoyed responding."

bipolar,f1abeoi,t1_f1a9g1j,1569289657.0,"The issue is the negative social stigma endured by children/teens/young adults.

My bipolar erupted when I was 17 at this time there was and probably still is no mental health awareness being used proactively at the high-school I attended. This resulted in me feeling like the only way I could go on is if I hit a reset button and pushed everyone away. It made me feel bad about myself and turned me from a more extroverted person into a highly introverted isolated person with social anxiety issues (well managed). Society‚Äôs view, through my eyes destroyed my self esteem for many years. 

I do not wish for anyone to suffer the pain endured in this way at a young age."

insomnia,f1a7yfl,t3_d8fcfk,1569287278.0,"Of course! Nothing you can do that will stop the body from healing itself. Organs do sadly fail at some point but I have a feeling medicine and science will fix that in my lifetime. Do I want to replace my organs to live longer is the question.

Simply begin not taking it. If you‚Äôre taking multiple pills of it I suggest a ween over a week or so however if experiencing more than normal problems with sleep I would consult a doctor to see if you can get prescribed something for a short time. However I trust you can easily do this without any additional meds. Just be patience and remain strong. Drinking water and fruit juice- cranberry preferably will do a lot to help detox your body of what it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want‚Äù. Insomnia is a huge issue because of what sleep deprivation can do as we all know here in this community. Trust in your body and make use of time while you‚Äôre awake I love to read before I sleep my brain takes in information and stores it very very well especially at night if I‚Äôm well rested, which is rare. But do as I suggested to tire yourself out. Get ahead of it! No problem is impossible to beat and figure out as long as you face it head on."
insomnia,f1a69gd,t3_d8fcfk,1569286126.0,"Melatonin and other hormone supplements are something I do not mess with. The more you take, your body says ‚Äúhey there‚Äôs a lot of this let‚Äôs stop this production‚Äù. Meaning your body is most likely running out of melatonin in your sleep and lasting until 4:30 as a result.

Alternative suggestions: tea- I love chamomile and kava, specially from yogi tea (stress and sleep blend) as they are a well respected.

Exercise obviously. At some point your body will run out of everything that is keeping you going. So many things could be out of balance currently and exercise is nature‚Äôs ‚Äúbalancer‚Äù for the body.

Warm milk and graham crackers before bed. Graham crackers are the snack they give cancer patients undergoing chemo for a reason- a lot of nutrients for what they are. Warm milk is soothing to the stomach and stimulates sleep. Also turkey.

A big factor on my sleep is also brain activity and light exposure about 4-5 hours before I sleep. So about 5:00 pm I shut my blinds and use a small lamp. My bedrooms have sunlight blockers as well because with my diagnosis I need to nap as well as take care of sleep hygiene.

And with that I‚Äôll leave you with this last thought. Sleep hygiene is just the same as teeth hygiene. What happens when you don‚Äôt brush? Cavities/ other bad things. Keep trying to figure out something that works for you until you‚Äôre happy. Good luck üëç"

bipolar,f1a4gah,t3_d8ff2c,1569284984.0,"Rsiperdal is one of the meds that saved my life from this diagnosis. Psychosis is a mean sucker. I would not worry about the side effects concerning memory if you are on it short term as it was prescribed to me. Communicate effectively with your doctor. 

Why not worry about memory? Because in the end the negatives out weigh the positives by far. And the brain is an amazing organ capable of regeneration as long as you are taking care of it. If worried research gray matter and things to improve short term memory. The brain is like an always-on computer that knows when there is damage and what needs to be repaired. Some mood stabilizers have neuroplastic properties(repair neuron connections). Good luck!"
bipolar,f19bi7x,t3_d8bzvc,1569270312.0,"Sorry I‚Äôm a bit hypo when I‚Äôm tired. I must reply to the title first because I know the great pain you‚Äôre enduring currently as I had a traumatic experience with mania/psychosis as well. Know in time your wounds will heal. You must relearn to trust yourself first and then others! I found it easiest for me to kind of take my manic break as a reset button. Meaning I sadly pushed away people who I felt would not benefit from dealing with me in my vulnerable state. To be honest though pushing away some great friends is a regret that I hold on to. But I also think it was responsible because sometimes people do have too much on their plate already. So in that I say if youre going to let relationships fade let it be a mutual decision instead of a forced one. Learn to trust your closest people again first once you trust yourself completely. This will be a hard fight to get back to 100% but you will get there. I never thought I‚Äôd be able to get a job again or get into college and I have had several impactful jobs and I‚Äôm studying at the best college for me! Things will turn up. Take it day by day. Patience is a hard thing to learn for everything but mania and hypo mania makes it even more difficult. 

The best part of all of this is once you hurdle all of these obstacles your pain will molt into success think of yourself as a caterpillar, who will soon become a butterflyüòâ
