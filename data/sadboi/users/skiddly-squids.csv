TrueOffMyChest,fphiti5,t1_fphgu65,1588622033.0,"The evidence suggests the exact opposite is true; people since the beginning of civilisation have been experimenting with gender fluidity, demonstrating that one’s gender identity can absolutely be different from their biological sex.

Also, nobody’s trying to “trick” anybody. People finally being allowed to live in the body they feel most comfortable in has nothing to do with anyone but themselves. The acceptance of trans people is not some elaborate scheme...

I think it’s clear that you can’t be convinced to try to understand another person’s experience when it has no relation to your own. Labelling a time of liberation as the “transgender crisis” also makes me extremely uncomfortable, so I would like to wish you well and say goodbye."
TrueOffMyChest,fphg9vn,t1_fphef00,1588620758.0,"Yes, it’s not the organic definition, but I don’t really see how that’s relevant. Now that there’s a conversation surrounding gender identity there’s a need for “gender” to refer to more than just a person’s sex."
TrueOffMyChest,fpgqlnc,t3_gd6eok,1588607720.0,"Wow..

I’ll just say this: claiming that “since there is no scientific evidence that people are born trans so people are trans because it’s trendy” is incredibly problematic and fallacious. NOBODY fully understands the intricacies of human identity or psychology. In stating this as if it’s fact, you (a supposed scientist — to whom people will refer in order to justify their transphobia and bigotry) are invalidating an entire population of people whose lives would absolutely be easier if they were cisgender. 

Until far too recently, homosexuality was medically diagnosed as a mental illness. All I’m saying is that science is constantly evolving, but people’s feelings and inherent right to express themselves as human beings has never been about being trendy. We finally have this incredible way to communicate with people from all walks of life all around the world and we are squandering it if we do not take a moment to walk the earth in their shoes. Nobody is in a place to tell anyone else that they’re feelings are not valid, that who they are is not valid. Whether you have a doctorate in psychology or not."
TrueOffMyChest,fpgo3lm,t1_fpgfyb0,1588606419.0,"Language is a limited form of communication. I don’t think anyone would argue that “gender” and “sex” had different meanings in 1066, but society has progressed so much since then; so too has our understanding of human identity. In modern day professional capacities, “gender” is used to express the sex with which a person identifies, whilst “sex” refers to the anatomy of a person at birth. Now more than ever it is blatantly clear that it is impossible for anyone to be certain of much, no matter how badly we crave certainty. The least we can do is try to understand the world from the perspective of others. If a person feels like themself expressing a gender different from their sex at birth, how little compassion must we have in order to deprive them of the privilege cis-gendered people are born with? Just because you don’t yet understand it does not mean you must vehemently reject it — and with it, an entire population of people who are discriminated against for merely expressing who they are, along with the people who support them."

If he’s clinically depressed (which it sounds like he is) they’ll prescribe antidepressants and may recommend a therapist. Be patient with him, depression often makes people self-isolate and push away people who are trying to help. It must be really difficult for him especially during quarantine, but I’d also recommend going for walks with him if you’re allowed to. But taking him to a psychiatrist and getting a diagnosis will hopefully help him to understand that he has an illness that needs treatment just as a physical illness would.

mentalhealth,fk3lukp,t1_fk3l8ds,1583839069.0,"Eating junk food is not “wrong”. They are not wrongly educating anyone, I genuinely have no idea how you became convinced of these notions. Look, bottom line is, other people’s bodies are none of your business. You are in no place to speak for them in saying that they aren’t actually recovered; everyone’s road to recovery is different but it’s always difficult so we should be compassionate and supportive instead of judgemental. Also, please don’t equate the unhealthiness of being anorexic to that of being fat. Anorexia has the highest fatality rate of any eating disorder, and being fat (if it’s under the obesity line) is nowhere near as dangerous. Please stop being so concerned with other people’s bodies. You don’t know what anyone else is going through, so you are in no place to judge. Fat-shaming is senseless and is largely what causes eating disorders in the first place. Please try to be more empathetic, a person’s value and deservedness to be happy has nothing to do with their weight."

mentalhealth,fk3krhl,t3_fgazbu,1583837904.0,"Dude. Please don’t pretend to know what people with anorexia are going through on their road to recovery. If someone who previously had anorexia has gained weight that is a GOOD thing. It means their body and brain can function normally because they are getting enough fuel to do so, and it means their relationship with food has improved as they are now able to eat and hopefully enjoy it. You have no idea if they are “pretending” to be recovered, and I can assure you someone with anorexia would not be eating if they were pretending to be recovered; they would still be anorexic. The whole point of recovering from anorexia is to find a healthy relationship with food and to love yourself and your body. The fact that you are now fat-shaming people with a past of serious body issues that lead to a dangerous eating disorder is incredibly inconsiderate. It is none of your business what other people’s bodies look like. If they have a better relationship with food and are happier and more secure in themselves after having gained weight, then they are recovered. And we should all be so happy for them."
mentalhealth,fk3k9jk,t3_fgbspa,1583837326.0,You are probably emotionally and mentally drained. A similar thing happened to me and I thought I was having a psychotic break.

- F.Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby

This probably isn’t my favourite novel of all time but I read this passage during the summer, which has always been a very meaningful time of year for me, and it perfectly encapsulated how I felt. It was a very powerful feeling, and I must have read and re-read the sentence at least a dozen times. Anyway, it was the first quote that came to mind."
relationship_advice,fj107xb,t3_faw0db,1582910699.0,"She needs to get professional help. There are psychologists who specialise in eating disorders and she needs to see one. As someone who has struggled with eating disorders, it’s impossible to overcome alone and without professional help. She may be hesitant about getting help, but in reality this is the eating disorder talking; she is clearly unhappy but knows getting help means having to eat and the eating disorder contradicts that. The best thing you can do is just to be there for her. Obviously I don’t know your girlfriend, but I would say don’t treat her any differently because of this (i.e. don’t seem overly concerned all the time). I’m sure she’d really appreciate feeling normal around you, and it’s good for her to not be constantly thinking about eating and her appearance. However, the most important thing is for her to get help. Wishing you both the best ❤️"
relationship_advice,fj0xx7j,t3_faw4xi,1582909563.0,"I completely understand where your coming from. There may be a chance he’s trying to break it off without hurting you, but it sounds like the timing just isn’t right, and he needs to grow by himself before he can fully commit to another person. It’s hard, but it sounds like it’s for the best. I would say don’t wait for him. You don’t know how long it will take for him to be ready, and it wouldn’t be fair on either of you if you were convinced it’s a temporary split. It would be great for the timing to be right in a few years but you can’t guarantee anything in life, the only thing you can do is move forward. I’d suggest cutting contact because as much as you still care about him and may want to be in each other’s lives, keeping in contact will make it almost impossible to move on. Focus on yourself and accept that you can’t just wait around for him to be ready to get back together. Try to move on. ❤️"
relationship_advice,fhugnqh,t3_f4vpa0,1581886186.0,"Hi :) This situation is so shitty and I’m so sorry you were forced into it. What your ex did was disgusting, and you are in no way at fault for what he forced you to do. It makes me so angry that he exploited you like that. From my perspective, you telling him was a show of trust, as it couldn’t have been an easy thing to do. I think that your boyfriend’s trust issues may have more to do with him than you. It seems like he doesn’t understand the gravity of that situation for you and isn’t empathising with what you went through. He should be appalled at the actions of your ex. He should be supporting you, not distrusting you. 

If your boyfriend is telling you you’re not good enough and that he doesn’t love you, is that really someone you want as your partner in life? Even when said in anger, those words show a level of disrespect and disregard for your feelings that can seriously impact your mental well-being and self-image. I obviously don’t know your boyfriend or your relationship, and I understand that we all say things we don’t mean in the heat of an argument, but I can’t imagine saying those things to someone I love. Those are things said to intentionally hurt another person, and people don’t intentionally hurt the people they love. At least, not in a healthy relationship. 

I hope this helps in some way, and I hope everything works out for you. xx"
relationship_advice,fhu7b24,t3_f4vplw,1581882847.0,"Hi :) First of all I’m really sorry that you feel this way about yourself. I think that this is an issue about your relationship with yourself and how you perceive yourself, as opposed to an issue about your relationship with your crush. I strongly recommend talking to someone. Try to seek out your school counsellor or a therapist. The input and help of an objective third party can be really helpful because as long as you keep these feelings of self-loathing to yourself nothing will change. You deserve to be heard, you deserve to be helped, and you deserve to be loved. You especially deserve to be loved by yourself. 

Also, in regards to the eating habits of restricting food, I know how you feel when you say it makes you feel better. Please bring this up with a counsellor as well. As someone who has suffered from anorexia, these signs point to anorexia. It makes you feel better about yourself, but it will never make you feel content with yourself. As long as your self-worth is reliant on your appearance, in my experience, you won’t be able to love yourself. Anorexia promises self-love, but it is never satisfied. In other words, as it escalated, no matter how much weight you lose, it won’t be enough. It also takes control of you very easily. I would recommend thinking of food as medicine; you need to eat in order to live. But genuinely, mental health issues are incredibly difficult to battle and overcome alone. Please talk to someone.

Remember that the things people love you for have nothing to do with your appearance. ❤️"
