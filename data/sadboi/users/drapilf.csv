DMs almost always try to help you do what you want if you ask nicely and don't intentionally try to break the game.

If I personally was asked if there are any ways I might be able to weird two heavy weapons dual wielding?
I would try to let that happen fairly because they asked nicely.
Maybe something like take great weapon fighting and dual wielder and you have no bonus from the feats other than that you can use the weapons as if you had proficiency with the weapon and they were light."

I'm glad she's done some things but some of these are hardly relevant. Bernie has done the same in all the major points in this source. He also has prior to this fought for women's rights so people saying he's sexist is disgusting."
