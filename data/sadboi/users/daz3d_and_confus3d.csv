mentalhealth,f22qref,t3_dbias0,1569894748.0,"I struggle with validating my depression as well, and will often think of how much worse others have it. I am trying to come to terms with the fact that we all experience our pain in different ways, and as a result of different experiences. Just because you may not have the same experiences as someone whose depression you find “valid”, does not mean that your battle with depression isn’t just as valid. It’s easy to say that without ever believing the words, but keep repeating that anyways. That’s what I’m doing, and I hope after reading through these comments you don’t feel as isolated with what you’re experiencing. <3"
