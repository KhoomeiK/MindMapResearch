bipolar,fpt5ucw,t1_fpt3gho,1588885379.0,"Thank you for the reassurance!

And ya that was my question. When I checked that with both doctors they were both confident it was, which is why I’ve got the two week follow up booked. If it’s still the same, then we know it’s not from it and I can go back on."
bipolar,fpsoonz,t1_fpslvuv,1588877021.0,"Did you have any withdrawal symptoms or experience seizures? I find that most scary to me right now. 

My fingers are crossed for you that this 8th cocktail is the one for you!  


And thanks for the note. I'll keep that in mind. Interesting."
bipolar,fpsgzop,t1_fpsgmpj,1588873316.0,"Totally get what your saying.  I more so was looking for some answers of what to expect or what their experience was with the rash or just a little support, no medical advice."

I'm still running the wild conversations my hypomanic self had with others on sunday through my head and kinda wanting to hide in a hole for approx 6 months."
bipolar,fpoa9w2,t3_gb20wq,1588781075.0,"Huge congrats!  
I've been trying to give up drinking.

I think this the inspo I needed. Thank you!"
bipolar,fpo9jp1,t3_gedqpb,1588780723.0,"My partner is the best and I don't feel alone anymore!

She is so supportive, patient and caring. She is so willing to learn and listen and takes the initiative to educate herself more all of the time. I love her compassion and leaves me in tears every night when we get into bed and I look at her and admire her beauty and the warmth of her heart (the good kind of tears). She never fails to amaze me everyday. 

Also, I don't know anyone with Bipolar Disorder, whether it be acquaintance, friend or family. I've felt very alienated since my diagnosis. For the first time I automatically referred to this community as WE when speaking about it to my partner! I realized I know a lot and it felt so good inside! I joined this subreddit a while ago and have never looked at it that way and  don't feel so lonely, stigmatized and misunderstood anymore! Thank you to everyone who contributes. 

And on a final note I splurged on a new mattress and pillow and finally can sleep a bit better!"
bipolar,fph01jm,t1_fpgd9zr,1588612565.0,"I introduced medical cannabis into my life about a year ago with the assistance of my Psychiatrist and the Medical Cannabis educators at their clinic.

CBD has worked best for me especially with concentration, motivation, relieving anxiety, and sleep. I prefer it in an oil due to its ease of controlling your dosing. 

I've recently enjoyed vaping or smoking the 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD in a flower. I get a light buzz from the THC that makes life feel like it ain't so bad, and all of the benefits of the CBD. One big change I've personally found since introducing the 1:1 is that I feel more intune and communicative of my feelings. I myself have moderate anger issues which I find the THC helps control better than the CBD alone."
