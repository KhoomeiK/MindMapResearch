I'm still not well, but not really sick either. No fever anymore, headaches are less, and my cough has improved but still there. Some days I feel well, other days I feel crummy.

I went back to the Dr, she ordered a chest x-ray, haven't heard back so I'm assuming it was clear.

The x-ray technician asked me a lot of questions including have I travelled recently, has anyone in my family travelled recently etc. My Dr told me if my symptoms persist or get worse to call first, not visit. Their reactions creeped me out a little, seems they are on the lookout.

I haven't gone back to that job, they are now struggling as most of their business is Chinese tourists who have cancelled. And after their total lack of concern for us employees, I don't want to go back. So I'm not sure if anyone else is sick.

I told my Dr and the health department about that day at work, but it's fallen on deaf ears. If my town ends up infected I'll be telling them again."

China_Flu,fg689a5,t3_ex0gty,1580558623.0,"Yeah no shit, of course hotel staff are going to get sick!

I work at a hotel in Western Australia, in a major tourism area. We've had huge bus loads of Chinese tourists for Chinese New year and even before that, since November and December. We've gone through way more tissues/Kleenex than usual, the rooms have been full of used ones. Toilet paper too. After years in the industry you can see when people are sick. the past 2 weeks have been that way. 

We handle used bedding and towels. Serve food, wash used utensils. Then there are the people who drive buses, greet guests at reception, handling their ID and cards. 

After my shift on Tuesday, seeing all the used tissues in rooms, I scoured the internet for health warnings for hospitality workers. Nothing beyond airline and cruise ship staff. Called the health department who just stated the obvious, use gloves and masks. This morning, Saturday, there are basic warnings for my industry. 

One of my coworkers on the breakfast shift asked our manager about safety serving the Chinese tour groups. She was reprimanded for racism. During the same shift she was told to wash used knives and forks in tepid dishwasher by hand, as it was too busy too wait for the commercial dishwasher. Later that day, the manger suggested we use facial masks and gloves for 'dust'. This part of Australia is not 'dusty' and our rooms are dusted every time we clean them. In other words, my employer isn't taking this risk seriously. 

I haven't been back to work since Tuesday and woke up with cold/flu symptoms this morning. I'm not panicking, but im nervous. Got a low grade fever, cough, nasal congestion and my eyes feel watery and hot. My daughter is starting to feel the same. I used gloves and masks, but with time pressure and no one taking it seriously it's hard to be careful enough."

AskReddit,f9pfl7x,t1_f9pfbki,1575533534.0,"Haha funny you should say that, my car is playing up, badly, trying to decide wether I'm better off repairing or replacing. At least I have options. A year ago I'd be a crying mess trying to figure out how I can get my daughter to school and myself to work, I was broke. I live out of town and have literally no one who'd help me. Hooray for money when no one loves you 😄😭"

GetMotivated,f2zkxc1,t3_deshxk,1570527782.0,"I'm a housekeeper at a hotel and I get weird reactions from some people. Like they seem to respect me less for it. Here in Australia with our good wages, I earn excellent money, anywhere from $500 on a quiet week, to $1200 per week when it's busy, and I have $10000 saved while still living comfortably. Bonus points for the fact that it keeps me fit, no paying for a gym to keep in shape. I know people with 'better' jobs who live paycheck to paycheck yet still seem to look down on me."
exjw,f1i7oig,t1_f1i6bzr,1569507072.0,I'm so sorry you've been through that. I hope you can get away from your family and have a peaceful life. Living in fear is awful and takes it's toll
exjw,f1i7hnj,t1_f1i3py1,1569507000.0,Yeah it didn't make sense to me either. I remember thinking Jehovah must be mean if I had to be in pain. But that it was ok to wear my plaster cast there? Even at 6 it all seemed so wacky and nonsensical to me

To think of you as a little kid, starting school with such a messed up arm made me cry a little. Sorry to hear that it still gives you pain"

exjw,f1i43st,t1_f1i1uoc,1569505640.0,"Poor kid 😔 and to have everyone 'mind their own business' over it. When a kid sees adults react to them being abused, they think it's ok and opens them up to more abuse. I went on to be sexually abused, then as a teen and adult got into all kinds of toxic, abusive situations. I'm sorry to hear that you know how abuse feels too. 

My mother started with the wooden spoon soon after becoming a JW, so I'm assuming it was the norm with them. It was a constant threat, and she ALWAYS carried through on her threats. She'd tell me I was getting the wooden spoon when we got home, I usually felt confused about why, it was minor stuff, then the feeling of dread would set it. Knowing it was waiting as soon as we got home. Sometimes if we were out all day it'd be anywhere up to 8 hours later. No wonder I was such a weird, anxious kid. She'd break around one every week or two, on my butt.

I have never owned a wooden spoon since I left home and never will."

exjw,f1hs4y0,t1_f1hev3e,1569499926.0,"Yes, we don't speak at all anymore. She left the org when I was 11, disfellowshipped for adultery. Married the guy, got bored with him 10 years later, had a string off affairs, then rejoined a couple of years ago when she got too old to go clubbing and hook up with younger guys. Now she's miss prim and proper again with her long skirts and button up shirts preaching and handing out pamphlets on street corners. It is a blessing that she rejoined, she knows I won't so she fully gave up on me as I'm a lost cause. Yay me 🙂"

exjw,f1hrjv3,t1_f1he6ne,1569499610.0,"Haha, JWs and their false idoltry. I loved madonna as a kid, like really loved her. I wasn't allowed to listen to her music or mention her name because she 'made a mockery' out of Christianity with her name, and her album the Immaculate collection. My parents were separated so my dad bought me the album on cassette and let me listen and sing along in the car. Our little secret 😊 if it weren't for him things would've been a lot worse."
