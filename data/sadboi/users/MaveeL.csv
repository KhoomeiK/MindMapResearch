Celestia Ludenberg from Danganronpa

Kanna  from Ms. Kobyashi‚Äôs Dragon Maid

Darkness from Konosuba 


I‚Äôm 24 btw.



I‚Äôm a total weeb tbh. But anyways, I‚Äôve actually named my hallucinations. The one that bites my foot is named Chew. The gray skinned black haired man with golden puppet strings protruding from his fingers is named Puppeteer. The hanging man (guy with dead eyes hanging from a noose) is Jerry. Then there‚Äôs one that looks like Ryuk the shinigami from Death Note. I call him Ryuk. Then there‚Äôs another one that looks like one of the other shinigami from Death Note. So I named her  Rem after the anime character she looks like. They‚Äôve become my dearest friends (along with the plushies & body pillows I brought to life) & well....I just wanna be honest. I‚Äôm not scared of them anymore. I know they‚Äôre hallucinations but in my heart, they‚Äôre real. Sorry if I misspelled anything I got tears in my eyes. 

Another thing to note, every friend group has an idiot. That idiot is Chew. I‚Äôm sorry if this reply is disappointing."
