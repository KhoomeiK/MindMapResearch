PS3,fpo7gva,t3_gelryc,1588779702.0,I recently got my ps3. I have a PS4 and before that I had an xbox360. A lot of games I really wanted to play like Metal Gear Solid 4 were exclusive to the console that I didn‚Äôt have so I‚Äôve been collecting as many as I could find. Gamestops don‚Äôt have a huge selection anymore so I liked to stop by different ones if I was passing by just to see if they had something different and they almost always did. Now I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I have what I‚Äôve always wanted as well as my old favorites from the past generation.
