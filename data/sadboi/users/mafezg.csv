offmychest,f94iibs,t3_e3phvs,1575089403.0,I am so so sorry for how this year went. Your brother is very lucky to have someone like you that cares and loves him so much. Hope you have a good transition into whatever life may bring you now and that you give yourself enough time to grieve and get better to life a full long happy life.

Skincare_Addiction,f3posap,t1_f3p2x36,1571062609.0,"Shea Butter is actually noncomedogenic, that’s why I’m using it bc it also helps with my acne scars. I’ve also tried the cerave cream but it feels way too heavy on my skin idk why. Works great for my boyfriend but I don’t like how it feels and I felt like it actually made me oily faster."

relationships,f3oftc7,t3_dhjjgz,1571016757.0,"I’m really sorry you’re going through this. I went through a similar situation a couple years ago. I say you should try to have a one on one with your mom and rest explain to her your point of view and how this all affects you, especially bc you’re worried about her and care so much for her. By the things you’ve said, I don’t trust the guy at all. Love can blind people, especially if they don’t really have any other sentimental connection with anyone else other than you. How is he planning to contribute to things whenever he moves in? Is he gonna pay her rent? Buy his own things or at least contribute to half of the normal expenses? You also said he doesn’t have a stable job, I really don’t see how this might work if he doesn’t put the effort and is actually contributing to it, but by the way it looks it just seems like he wants someone to maintain him"

relationships,f2ajuds,t1_f2aib82,1570114226.0,Girl we are all literally trying to help you and make you see how he’s treating and manipulating you but you chose to keep defending him. You not thinking that you’re worth being with someone better is also a problem. Learn to love yourself a bit more and you’ll realize the kind of love you deserve. You shouldn’t settle someone like that
relationships,f2ahmko,t1_f2agri5,1570113446.0,"What makes you think that no one will ever find you the most beautiful to them? Every one has a different perspective of beauty, and that’s what makes them unique. Him being honest is good, I never said it wasn’t. But just the fact that he told you that girls who he finds beautiful are out of his league just makes him seem like he’s settling for you. And that’s never good. Him telling your that he’s being honest and that your should be grateful for that sounds a lot like manipulation, be careful about that. If you are in a healthy relationship, your partner is supposed to make you feel like the best thing in the world, not like the half way there."
relationships,f2agg01,t3_dcqxma,1570113022.0,"I think there is a difference between someone that cares about you as a person and someone that cares about you because they love you like he says he does. I believe that he cares about you and that’s why he’s attentive in certain ways and makes you feel they way you say. However, no person that loves their SO would tell them that “they’re not pretty yet” or that pretty people are out out his league. That just makes it seem like he’s settling with you bc he can’t be with whoever he wants to be. I know it’s hard to see the difference when you’re in love with someone. But no one knows your relationship better than the two of you. What he said to you clearly took a big blow on your self esteem so just think about it if it’s worth going through that. You both are young, I’m sure you needed this to realize how much you’re worth and the type of treatment you deserve from your SO. You’ll find someone who knows how to treat you right, respects you, and find you the most beautiful person in the world."
