BGCCircleJerk,fr3fs8v,t1_fr367dc,1589856469.0,i regretted online sex work despite the fact im a stripper and thought i knew enough about sex work to be smart. i wasnt comfortable doing stuff online and found myself being persuaded into filming things because i was desperate for money. i definitely think there needs to be more information out there that is unbiased and doesn‚Äôt stigmatise SWs but does warn and educate people on the issues with specifically online sex work. people making sure he didnt rush this decision and is confident in it is 100% a good idea imo. im constantly concerned about how i have possible content out there that im uncomfortable with. it is not a mistake i can forget or take back. however im definitely NOT down with the SW shaming and homophobia and those people need to move along sis

I can see how it could be seen disrespectful but I understand why they do it and that it is not meant to be disrespectful! And Kendall does pose in her thumbnails lol.

1: he makes accusations about james but not dahvie. also he did accuse dahvie in tweets in the past and its shady and makes me think jeffree saw something. also can we mention jeffree sexually assaulting 2 men in 2 videos and the fact hes got a record of chatting up underage men?

3: if he has this incriminating evidence and james is a danger, its irresponsible not to take that to police or reveal it. so I think if he does have it and isnt saying or if hes lying and has nothing, either way jeffrees still being a douche"
