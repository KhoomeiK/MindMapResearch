Yes. This might sound weird but back in my university days, I used to literally predict when 2 ppl are gonna start dating/fall in love. Whether I see them in person (very subtly) flirting or through online comments/dropping hints. It's like I know before they even know.

- the boyfriends had reached a point of fucking me up of no return and I got SO fed up with the crying and hurting
- it was after a series of breaking up & reconciling that I came to realize how toxic and damaging to my self-esteem the r.ships were
- and I came to realize that this cycle of me forgiving their slights, blaming myself, putting up with the neglect, the accusations of cheating, and all the other crap was only hurting me more and more
- I started focusing on myself and my mental and emotional well-being, thereby inevitably removing their toxicity from my life 
- and I think the biggest one: I only left for good when I knew there was absolutely no hope, not even a sliver, for salvaging the r.ship.. so I stopped fighting for it. It would never be what I wanted it to be.
