PublicFreakout,fmgsvay,t3_fv0vto,1586056931.0,"with this quarantine going on & humanity being so dumb, careless, soulless & selfish. not giving a shit about the people suffering. this guy isn’t excused but i feel like he’s my spirit animal. just STAY HOME!!!!!!!! i shouldn’t be cheering on an old dude getting physical with teens. he’s seen a lot in his day, he’s probably disappointed & sickened with the mindset & behavior of people & lost his shit. yall need to get it together people of our “great nation”. they’re are people losing loved ones, people are laying in hospital beds sick or dying. but yet we have people young & old acting like nothing is wrong with the world & causing more pain & suffering then there already is. please people take this situation seriously. & to the ones who are, thank you."
