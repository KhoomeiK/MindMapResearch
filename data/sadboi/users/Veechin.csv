depressionregimens,fcnn6a8,t3_ei60yx,1577814668.0,"This is very interesting.

I’ve been on Effexor for 16 years. In March, I stepped down to my lowest dose (37.5 mg). It was not a wise idea (even though I was under doctors supervision). I didn’t tell anyone I was suffering and that, along with some major life decisions that need to be made, caused me a huge anxiety tornado and a spiral into a depressive episode. 

Yesterday, I had my appointment with my psychiatrist and she decided to put me on Pristiq. I’m currently taking 75 mg of Effexor and 50 mg of Pristiq. The hope is that I level out and next month, I’ll see her again for next steps.

I know from personal experience that Effexor withdrawal is horrific. During my last step down in March, I was an absolute mess— hysterical tears, brain freezes, no appetite. I felt this super emotion of anger, incredible sadness, and shame— it was unlike anything I had felt in my previous 30 years.

Since I’m on day 1 of Pristiq, I don’t have any anecdotal evidence for you. However, you *must* bring this up to your doctor!

Sending you good vibes."
