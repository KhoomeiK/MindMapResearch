It sucks, but just know you will be okay and tell yourself it‚Äôs okay to step away from things to get over the feeling. :)"

I was able to get the save data back though because of the cloud save (I think lol)

NintendoSwitch,fkklye1,t1_fkkldz2,1584287010.0,They had two different profiles for the transfer though? I assumed I had to make a new profile on the new switch because of that and also because it said the switch had to be on v. 4 or higher.
NintendoSwitch,fkklrrr,t1_fkkkxj0,1584286894.0,I am a little worried because when I go to data management there is nothing there.
NintendoSwitch,fkkljjc,t1_fkkkpg4,1584286749.0,"So when I go to Data Management - there isn't anything, but there is transfer your save data option, but my old switch doesn't have anything on it. Like I was in the middle of Final Fantasy X and when I put the game in (the old switch) my save file was not there.

&#x200B;

Also I have an SD from my old switch. Which when I put it in the new one, it says I have to delete it. I am backing up my SD right now."

Forgot to mention that."
Wheatens,fjrrjyk,t3_fetja8,1583589263.0,"If you are crate training, get a 36‚Äù crate. It will be huge at first but trust me they grow into them. 

Also start grooming as soon as they are of age. You want them to get use to it."

tales,fb9egah,t3_ec5k8m,1576636435.0,"One thing I would say about graces, is it did have an actual romance and with other characters, not just the main guy. But I loved and hated that especially in the lineage and legacies . Like I am all about cherabel but it was put it in your face too much. Kinda the same with pascal and Hubert but that was more cute than annoying. 

Also, I didn‚Äôt like how it went from the power of friendship in graces to all about death and no one lives forever in lineage and legacies. It went from yay happiness to everyone‚Äôs going to die and deal with it."

He told me two girls walked over to him and one of them just grabbed his chest and started squeezing it. He looked at them like what the fuck and they walked away giggling. 

If the roles were reversed, he would have been charged for sexual assault."
