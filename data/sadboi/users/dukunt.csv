Every 2 weeks she'd find a different reason to breakup. Mostly due to jealous reasons. She scoured my Facebook and would look for reasons to get jealous. She accused me of being flirtatious. One of the girls she said I was flirtatious with was my cousin.
Every 2 weeks she would end things. ""I never want to see you again!"" kind of break up. Then 2 weeks after that she'd come sniffing around, repeat process.

She was addicted to drama. 
So much so that she would invent drama where there was no drama. So typical highschool girl kind of stuff but we were both 40 years old.

Inside the glass display case was a perfectly round rock that would slowly roll just by thinking about it rolling.

Many years go by and I realize that a rock that rolls around powered only by thought was impossibly. Therefore it must have been a dream.

This thought never leaves me.

I turn 21 and I go on a trip to Niagara Falls with my girlfriend. We go to the Believe It Or Not Museum. I search for the thought powered rock. Just as I remembered, inside a case is a rock that rolls around powered by thought.
It was no dream.

Time goes by and I start having doubts again. Such a rock could not be real. It must have been a dream.

Has an original story about a young man who goes off in search of answers along the fictitious Interstate 60 and finds many places that shouldn't exist. He is aided by a mythical character played by Oldman. A truely great piece of fantasy. The direction can be a little rough around the edges and not very many people know of this film. The film is incredibly intelligent, the story is very well written. More people need to see this film. Bob Gale's best achievement."

Advice,fptb94q,t3_gff8gu,1588888109.0,"Before you do anything drastic, learn to get comfortable in your own body before to even think about cutting any thing off. Research is showing that the suicide rate is the same for people both pre-op and post-op, meaning that changing ones sex doesn't make your problems go away. You get only one shot at life and while i want you to be happy in this life, i don't want you to do anything that to may regret. 
If you were to get a sex change how do you think that  your life improve? A sex change doesn't really turn you into a woman. You will never be able to have children like a real woman. You will, for the rest of your life have to be on medication so your body doesn't reject all the changes surgery has done to you. 
Who are to attracted to?
Men? Women? If you're attracted to men then you're dating pool just got smaller. Gay men want to date other men. Not women. If your attracted to women then your dating pool just got smaller as well. Gay women want to date other women.
You are now dating in a very specific niche. Family oriented straight men will not be interested in you. Gay men are out. Lesbians are out. You can still find love but will it be the love that you want?

My advice, enjoy being a man. Surgery will always be an option. It can wait. Surround yourself with the best people that you can. Date, fuck, enjoy yourself, learn about yourself. Find happiness. Go slowly. You get one life. Just one. Thinking that you will find happiness in the body of the opposite sex is similar to ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" fallacy. You think that being a woman will solve all your problems? You're just going to find that there is a whole new battery of problems to deal with."

Advice,fntbq5m,t3_g3sonx,1587238475.0,"I don't know what the trouble between your parents is, all I really knows is that your father is leaving. I can assure you this, he doesn't want to go. He wants your mother to change something about herself. But people don't change. Sometimes things will be better if the parents do spit up. My ex-wife and I split up 5 years ago. I threw her out. She was not a good mother. She isn't involved in her kids lives and that's a good thing. I'm happier as a single parent and I can get along with their mother as a friend, my kids have adjusted. This is my situation, not yours. 

Tell your dad how you feel. You may not get another chance. Your dad does not want to go. If you want to live with him over you're mom tell him. Realize that their marriage is falling apart but they will never stop loving you or your siblings. Make sure that your parents know how you're feeling right now. Your family will likely change, your parents are going to keep loving you. If your dad does leave do what you can too keep open lines of communication with him.  Call him as often as you feel necessary. Keep him active in your family. The more time that passes between the times that you talk with your dad will only get longer and longer. Don't let that happen. Don't let either parent bad mouth the other parent. That's not cool. A marriage ending is incredibly painful but if is not the end. With time your parents may learn to get along with eachother and they may become friends. Be there for your parents. Lend them an ear. Do not accept bad-mouthing from either of them. They will only talk about their ex-spouse in a respectful manner if they want to talk to you about it. That is a rule that you can set. Good luck to you.
