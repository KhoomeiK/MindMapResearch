OutOfTheLoop,f3so83e,t1_f3sl4dk,1571106026.0,"Oh, I'll be reading that right now, it is so well written!

And yes, I meant the protesters, sorry if I didn't make that clear. The point is that these protests right now are not actually about the independence, they are about freedom of thought and freedom of speech.

For example, I'm not pro-independence by all means, but I will be supporting these protests. Specially because of the sentence to the two guys who organized **peaceful** pro-independence protests. *Jordi Sánchez* and *Jordi Cuixart* got arrested and thrown into jail even before the uni-lateral declaration of independence. They have been in jail for 2 years now, and they will spend the next 7 inside too. Nine years for protesting peacefully, which is *basically* a [human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_protest).

Sorry if I got a little bit political here, it's been a rough day. If you have any questions or want to know how it is from the inside, just DM me!"

OutOfTheLoop,f3skem3,t1_f3siu6b,1571104273.0,"You're mostly right except in that last part:

Only some of the organizers of the referendum fled, with most of them staying in Catalonia. They were arrested almost 2 years ago, along with the main organizers of the pro-referendum protests, and they all have spent those 2 years in prison without an actual sentence. 

Now, just under 15 hours ago, the sentence finally came out, and it's between 9 to 13 years to almost all of them. This has angered a lot of people in Catalonia, pro-independence and anti-independence alike (even though the majority is pro-indepence), and they all have organized through ""Tsunami Democràtic"" to storm the airport.

Aside from that, really good summary! Are you from Catalonia?"
OutOfTheLoop,f3sj423,t1_f3sfydw,1571103670.0,"There has been a strong response by the catalan police, with hundreds of officers in riot gear dispatched to the airport. The spanish government has not yet made an official statement about these protests but I'm sure it soon will. Also, the protests are supposed to last until friday so the spanish government will surely send in a lot of reinforcements, probably even the army if shit goes down. And to be honest with you, I think it probably will.

Source: Also catalan."

My first gf ever broke up with me a month ago and now she's fucking dating one of my friends. I'm so fucking down in the dumps right now I can't even see the sky. But I fucking know the sky is there and I know it's not going anywhere. Some nights like this one I just want everything to end, but then you gotta think: Am I going to let this bitch hurt me even when we're not together anymore? Fuck her! You deserve much more than that!

So just keep climbing, and if you fall get the dust off and get the fuck back up. You will get out of there, but you gotta work for it. I know it's hard but it's the only way to get better. And you will.
