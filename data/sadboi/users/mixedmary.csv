Advising women to leave or not go back to abusers was always a derailment from dealing with the problem and was actually always degrading to women and it probably actually made women feel more like second class citizens and more degraded for people to put the responsibility with them to leave and to make it women’s wrong choice to not leave or to contact the abuser again rather than those men’s choice to abuse.
mdmatherapy,fr47bri,t1_fqzo8bo,1589878377.0,Since you say you are struggling with porn addiction and want to stop watching it but can’t seem to did you ever take MDMA and watch pornography and think of the harm being done to the women and men in the pornography or read some of their stories of the harm done to them while on MDMA?
mdmatherapy,fr4519n,t3_gjdrt4,1589876050.0,"No I don’t think you should take it again. Its great that your parents are proving shelter but if everthing were as safe and great as you say it is you would not need to take mdma again and you would not have blocks in “processing” things and you wouldn’t need to remember again. Your brain is the product of thousands of years of evolution and if especially if after taking MDMA you forgot things or can’t process things it’s for a good reason. Your brain is protecting you and there must be some reason that your brain needs to protect you. It’s like this taking MDMA is like climbing a mountain to see a sort of roadmap of the terrain and where you need to get but to use a present day example if you need to get across a border and that border is closed by the quarantine, there is a real world blockade and there is no need to climb up the mountain again to know that that other place you saw up there exists. You know it does and you know there is a way to get there and how to get there but the way is blocked. (In reality the blockade might be not having justice or the abuser being in jail or punished).

This is also why I don’t think we should be giving MDMA to traumatized or oppressed people because they have real world problems. It’s not helping them to climb the mountain and see the roadmap. If someone else or people who are capable of moving the blockade or opening the road for them climbs up and sees that that’s the path and they need to get through it, that’s their block, perhaps that’s the person, the people who have the power to move things who should be going up and seeing what needs to be done.

To send the person who already climbed the mountain back up there could just be frustrating for them. Also if you are in a situation of being stuck with abusive people and don’t have the power to leave and you get all these feelings and memories that can cause a lot of conflict and if these are people who abused you in the past well I wouldn’t want to get into conflict with an abuser while I am in a less powerful state compared to them."

She might also open up and be able to talk about things more that she wouldn’t otherwise if you talk to her while you are on it because it makes you a better listener.

Also even if she’s in severe pain and has a lot of trouble functioning or debilitating symptoms she doesn’t need to take it to be fixed because she’s not sick or damaged. Because a person is in pain it doesn’t mean they are the problem or the thing to fix."

Men have more power and they can misuse it if they want and if they don't have a conscience. If a man wants to give up  his power he can but as a man he does have that power to abuse you and get away with it because of gender. Now some women might have more money or a lot of lawyers in their family or parents that really fight for or male family members who really fight for them, or racial or class status so men might not have as much power to abuse them but men do have power over women, that's how ""being a man"" and ""being a woman"" work. In the gender hierarchy men get to be dominant and everyone buying into gender think that is the way it should go and the natural order of thing. It seems correct and right for the man to be in control and to be dominant ""and even a little abusive.""

Also unless someone has really decided that they are a conscientious person who wants to be fair and equal a lot of human beings (women included) do misuse power so you do have reason to fear many people who have more power than you whether it's in the gender hierarchy or the racial hierarchy or class hierarchy or whatever hierarchy.

Also some women might say they don't live in fear of men (granted you could have some men who you have come to trust because you know they are a highly conscientious person who will not misuse their power or exploit the power imbalance) but on a general level to claim this is ridiculous and it's only denying reality, not just because you deny it does it make it true. The women who deny this that men have power over us and we have a reason to fear them, doing that is pretty ridiculous and I don't want to sound disparaging but it's like well the joke is on them."

(Look at the poor men in old age homes dying from COVID.) Some kids were so successful that they bought their parents a house. What your son's father is doing is not only morally wrong but it's also stupid. It's not a smart or wise thing to do. What you are doing is the smarter thing to do. The kids that go farthest in life and are able to help their fathers later on are the ones that the fathers invested the most in caring for and did equal childcare with and supported financially and didn't abuse them and were fair and equal. Some empathetic fathers worked very hard to do equal childcare for their kids and to make sure their kids had everything and more and to be patient and kind with their kids, the loving fathers like this were the smartest and wisest people. Your son's father may not have thought all of this through and probably feels he is smart for exploiting you, but it's not smart and if he had empathy for you and his son he wouldn't have made this mistake and be making this mistake and he would be doing things that are more likely to work out for his best interest in the end."

Sure they are missing out on a lot of logic and factual information but no matter how intellectually disadvantaged or unable to reason they might be, they would see through this is they had some empathy and care and love for the people suffering from losing their jobs and health insurance. Their problem is lack of empathy and care. Lack of intelligence (if they truly have that problem) is the least of their problems by far and a much easier problem to fix than lack of empathy and the callousness. The problem is by far not lack of intellectual intelligence as much as lack of moral intelligence and hate and no love. Personally I don't care what side of these debates people end up on because it's always possible for even the smartest person to make logical errors and there will always be someone smarter than you who can run circles around you but a lot of people would not fall into these traps if they had empathy for the disadvantaged and that's what I think those people's primary problem is.

This is also why people are going to furiously hide it if they came from poverty or any kind of abuse or disadvantage. Because they know many people will start viewing it like this if they show any inch of skin or vulnerability. Also remember that when society has this perspective telling oppressed people to just be grateful for any crumb the get because ""look how far you've come, congratulate yourself"" they miss out on people's contributions and avoid fixing real problems and inequalities in society.

The prostitution survivors probably saved other women from this sex for rent happening to them because they know how precarious women's situation is and how easily any little break down can lead to women falling into prostitution.

TwoXChromosomes,fqj8c7d,t1_fqj119z,1589406425.0,Swedish men are just basically well brought up and they got shown a lot of these things all their life and pretty much like it’s a comparatively functional society (granted we all still have a long way to go on getting rid of gender and sexism including the Swedes) where their parents and everyone have them proper direction and set them ok the right path to not trash women. They know how to do good for themselves and often they have family support their family will not enable them in self destruction. This is just a general observation and also many men in Nordic countries got this which is not to say that there aren’t other men in other countries who had this and have supportive parents or who made the decision that this is how they want to be and act.

RationalPsychonaut,fqj7uzr,t3_gc8j43,1589406237.0,Yes probably MDMA can help if someone who is a friend or partner or family membher and wants to help them takes it and talks to them but Oh my god please don’t give them psychedelics. I think it’s best to not give anyone who is in a precarious position this and especially not people who have made suicide attempts. They are already burdened. If other people take MDMA and get empathy that’s a great thing and listen empathetically to them that’s a great thing and can go really far at helping.

It's not like if a ""bad boy"" becomes abusive and a woman thought she could fix him now the abuse is suddenly her bad choice rather than his bad choice. How did that magically get shifted and the blame and responsibility magically got shifted like that ? If you choose to be a bad person abuse is 100% your responsibility. And ""picking bad guys"" does not suddenly make bad choices on the part of some men into women's problem and responsibility. The abusers need to clean up their mess and be given full responsibility for their mess rather than women being told to pick better partners or to get informed on how to not end up with bad guys or not get abused. It's not women's responsibility to know the signs and all that nonsense we are taught, it's the abusers' responsibility  not to abuse and many countries have slid into war and destruction from the rape and abusing and enabling of abusers and telling would be victims to make better choices instead of society dealing with abusers. And the abusers themselves then paid the price often with their lives. And the therapists did not help matters by teaching women that it was their fault and to go for therapy and fix their traumatic bonding and know the signs of an abuser. Many therapists too probably died when their countries slid into war and destruction. And the sad truth is that there are therapists in Venezuela or from there or Yugoslavia telling women to pick better partners or watch for the red flags of abuse that abusers running unchecked led to the country falling into war or poverty and those same therapists probably ended up in porn and prostitution after their countries slid into war, poverty and destruction. 

Also what makes for a feminist or equal marriage is if the man wants that. It's in his power. The same goes for an anti racist friendship, if the white person wants that then it will be if they don't it won't be. It's very simple.

It's like predicting who will win a marathon in the first five minutes of the race and disparaging one person who is a few paces behind, that's nonsense and says nothing when there is another two hours to the race. Over time once the lockdowns are eased in other countries the deaths are going to rack up to the level of Sweden's whereas they are on track to get herd immunity in a week and no more deaths and they can completely go back to normal. The damage to their economy will be comparatively speaking completely over (and they didn't even get much damage because they never locked down). Everyone else is going to have to damage their economy (people are already dying from the poverty, women are getting in domestic violence and sex for rent situations) while waiting twelve months for a vaccine. People are going to die either way, especially children. If they get herd immunity now and everyone else does not, everyone else is going to keep getting many deaths until a vaccine becomes available while you are just seeing all their deaths for the entire year at once here.

Places like Singapore as soon as they eased the lockdowns they got a second wave. And places that are being lauded as a success like New Zealand as soon as they ease the lockdown they can get a second or third way because most of people aren't immune.

It's just like ""This person is struggling with school"", there can be a variety of causes and explanations why.

LifeProTips,fqdemnq,t3_gi7rkx,1589287949.0,"I don’t think one should feel embarrassed and ashamed but guilty and like one should try to repair the transgression/clean up the mess. Embarrassment is a very destructive emotion, it just destroys a person, feeling sad over what you did and compelled to try to undo it is much more productive and can make you a better person.

Eg The man who wrote Girl With the Dragon Tattoo talked about how when he was a teenager he witness a girl being gang raped and didn’t stop it or stand up for her and later he realized what he did was wrong and he went and told her sorry and she said she said she did not forgive him and he felt she was right and in a sense to undo that was part of the burden that he carried to work on women’s rights and advocate for women. He didn’t feel embarassed because he was literally telling people the story of what he got wrong (if he felt ashamed he would have been trying to hide it and would not have been telling the story) while trying to correct it and do the right thing. He felt sad. One is productive (including to creating a good society for yourself and correcting the wrongs in society which can protect your society from sliding into poverty and war) and one is destructive. People who feel embarrassed often try to just bury what they did wrong and hide it form themselves and deny it, they won’t approach it to correct it.

Also people who feel embarrassed have no hope they just feel like a bad, people who feel guilt feel like good people who have hope and motivation that they can work to repair what they did wrong. There’s a huge difference."
CPTSD,fqbup1b,t1_fqb7w4l,1589244279.0,"Sorry to the other poster if it seems I am taking out my issues on them. I am debating them on it, on the facts not trying to attack them personally and maybe it seems that way unfortunately but I am against the idea not them.

Bullying and being bullied are actually political issues. And there is not a person on earth that hasn’t been bullied so I suppose you could take a survey of bullies and find that 100% of them have been bullied and had their trauma and find those statistics. It doesn’t mean that their bullying caused them to bully others. It’s still a choice, many other people had trauma and didn’t bully.

People *think* it’s a way to navigate trauma sure but it’s a way to navigate your boat like sailing the titanic into an iceberg. You think you will get there faster out of your trauma faster but in reality you sink. It’s not a way to navigate trauma. It’s a way to navigate so that you sink though sure it can be tempting and it looks like a good course I can see."
CPTSD,fqbrr07,t1_fqb34ww,1589242643.0,">If it's not unresolved trauma from oppression that causes people to feel justified oppressing others, what do you think is the actual reason behind it

It’s just a choice. They want to have a power trip and do what they feel will bring them power. Violence and sadism feels good to some people even though it works out badly for them in the end and it makes them more likely to themselves be the victims of sadists who will in turn have a laugh at their expense and enjoy them being hurt. It feels like a route to power (which is why it might seem like a good route out of oppression for some people and why they might feel their trauma has made them this way, like having a power trip makes them feel powerful whether or not it actually gives them power, also this might be why people are arguing that trauma makes you need to do this to compensate “I lost my power due to oppression so now I have to do this to grab back some power, if I can get some power by trampling on someone weaker then I can get more power and get out of my oppression” or “I am justified in bullying someone else if this is a way for me to get out of being bullied by another person, I was only doing it to end the other bullying”) but it’s not, it’s the reverse you lose more power and make yourself more vulnerable to bullying and it’s a choice to bully. People with sociopathic patterns of behavior are actually more likely to be bullied themselves not less likely to bully. Also if being a sociopathic was an effective way out of oppression then why is it that there aren’t more women sociopaths ? We could all turn into sociopaths and end the problem of women’s oppression overnight and rape overnight for us then. Why is it that that would not end rape? Turning into a sociopath does not get you out of your oppression, the people who are oppressing you and are on top of you are not going to start loving you or want to stop exploiting you because you turned into a sociopath and are in turn doing oppression to other people. They aren’t going to like you better or want to give you equality because you are in turn hurting someone with less power. It doesn’t work. They aren’t going to say oh that woman is nasty to animals and likes having power trips too, now we respect her for that. It doesn’t get you out of oppression. Sadly if it did probably a lot more people would be doing it. It actually makes you weaker.

Also there are many many things that people do that make them feel powerful and make them feel like they are getting power (eg like screaming at other people) that often don’t actually give them power but make them lose power. Just because something feels empowering or makes you feel strong it doesn’t necessarily make you strong. Also just because something makes you feel weak it doesn’t necessarily make you weak. Feelings are not everything and feelings are not the ultimate measure of truth. In fact if someone wants to attack you or exploit you they can frequently lead you down a path of doing things that make you feel powerful while actually taking your power from you. I mean what better way to con someone and steal power from them. That’s often how people get power over others they decisive them into giving yo their power by doing something that makes them feel powerful while actually making them lose their power."
CPTSD,fqboq4e,t1_fqb0kwn,1589240994.0,"If people aren’t motivated to not bully for moral reasons or compunctions of conscience then their own self interest is basically the only other motivating factor for them to stop. So it is pertinent from that standpoint. And it’s the truth bullying does not work out for the bullies, it makes them gullible and exploitable and more likely to be bullied themselves."
CPTSD,fqb1pj3,t1_fqavj4q,1589229038.0,"I don’t really want to try to make you take my viewpoint on this it when you say that most bullies were traumatized what you are saying is that they were oppressed with an oppression like eg sexism or racism or classism or child abuse or homophobia. (Well in a sense you are right there is scarcely a person on earth that hasn’t had some oppression, even if you are a white male billionaire on the top of everything many of them had child abuse or some oppression. So if trauma becomes an excuse and trauma made you do it then pretty much every single person in the world has an excuse. So we might as well give up on confronting bullying then.) Oppression does not make one oppress someone else. It’s not like because women are under sexism we are now turned racist or classist. Those are two separate issues. I don’t know what to say but maybe the kids on the bad side of town it was partly the bad side of town and the poor side of town because the kids were being allowed to bully and get away with bullying and use their poverty as an excuse and that’s why they actually ended up staying in poverty on that side of town as adults. So they were victims but were victimizing themselves in a way. It’s important that people not get a victim mentality and blame other people for problems that are of their own creation, like eg if you are a poor person but are beating up poor women and sabotaging and killing talent which can help you get out of poverty you can’t turn around and blame rich people or billionaires for that. Sure you are oppressed but you have to take responsibility for your part in your misery. And the same for people of colour who are doing bullying to women and the poor and then say they are oppressed because of racism, sure they are but the part of bad things happening to them that is due to their own actions and hurting women that’s wrong to blame white people for that. They did not do that to you, you are doing that to yourself. And also sometimes the feminists don’t confront bullying among women and then say that all their problems are due to sexism. That’s wrong to blame men for things that aren’t their fault but women bullying other weaker women is victimizing themselves. And also this then discredits anti racism or feminism or gay rights or whatever and people don’t take it seriously anymore. Then people lose out in their anti oppression fight because it becomes like a boy who cried wolf scenario. Not that I think that’s a reason for people to not confront racism or sexism but when you are an oppressed woman and you’re blaming men for things that aren’t their fault it’s not going to make friends for you (also if men have more power than you I wouldn’t want to be blaming them for things that aren’t their fault, because the men get frustrated) or if you are an oppressed person of colour and blaming whites people for things that aren’t their fault those people already have more power than you and I wouldn’t want to blame them for things that aren’t their fault. It’s gets frustrating for people when they feel they are getting blamed for things that aren’t their fault and the parts of people’s problems which are self created and their own self harm. People do get frustrated when they are trying to help someone and that person is self harming by bullying others which is the true self harm. It’s very hard to help people in that state. Yes people need help with their oppression but you don’t realize that if people help you out of oppression and you are self harming by bullying others you will quickly fall back into oppression. Bullying others makes bad things happen to you and makes you get bullied. So someone can help you get out of your oppression and if you are self harming by bullying others you can end up back in oppression. It’s very difficult if you can try to take a person out of their oppression but they still have the bully in them and the bullying instinct in them. Eg You could have been helped with your poverty issues and the child support issues but even then that would not have meant you would have stopped bullying if you hadn’t made that choice to stop yourself. And if you kept on bullying then you could have created more problems for yourself and gotten bullied again.

Sadly there are actually many people who got help with their oppression like poverty or domestic violence or prostitution or racism or homophobia or whatever it was and they got out of their oppression but because they still had a desire to do dominance and bullying then they destroyed things for themselves and ended up back in their oppression. This is not to blame them for their oppression but if for example you get out of poverty but now you hate the people on welfare and destroy the social safety net then that can create more income inequality and actually make you end up in poverty. Or if you get out of domestic violence or rape but now you start giving therapy to women and teaching them that domestic violence or prostitution is a bad choice and reinforcing sexism and tearing feminism apart then that comes to destroy women’s rights in society and roll women’s rights back and the you can end up back in domestic violence. It’s a very sad situation. And it’s very difficult if you want to try to help people out of their oppression but then they want to do things that reinforce their oppression and now they can end up back in it again. Because then it’s like your help to them is almost going nowhere and they are rolling it back. What is the point ? It comes to seem like meaningless."

In fact the way some people think about it is that when they were on the bottom and the little person it felt bad and they hate that and oppose that with all their heart so when someone else is the little person and they have the opportunity to bully or see them being bullied they will oppose that with all their heart so as to oppose their own bullying.

It's not a smart idea but you did show wisdom in stopping and helped yourself. And if you had tendencies where you wanted to dominate it's not because of your trauma. There are a lot of people who want to dominate who aren't poor or disadvantaged and bullying is not something limited to poor kids whose parents don't pay child support. It's also not helping the bullies and puts poor kids whose parents didn't pay child support in an even worse position as if they need that on top of everything else. Now they get an added disadvantage. Sadism doesn't work out and it doesn't help you progress in life or make you richer or better off, often it does the reverse and people end up in bad situations or bullied themselves because they bullied others. Someone even once said that women who bully other women are more likely to end up in domestic violence themselves. It's not doing people a favour to enable them in bullying and the worse off they are, the more imperative it is that they don't bully and make things even worse on themselves. It was smart that you stopped he bullying and put aside the sadism because it would not contribute to your healing and you yourself might have ended up getting even poorer and then feeling even worse about yourself."

And also in a sense people should  be a little more forgiving of women on maybe being mess or something but not if we are being nasty, the thing is that it truly is self harm for men and hurting them. It's not a privilege that people give them a ""pass"" this way. The people enabling them this way are doing them a great deal of damage and aren't actually good friends to them.

Also if you are pretending that someone's alcoholism is cute and funny that's sort of enabling and at the end of the day that's not helping that man either. It's bad for them and hurts the men in question too. Also feminism won't be an excuse for women to be charming and nasty like this and get off because ""But she's so funny.""

Bullying does not work out for bullies. It also impedes healing. You made a smart choice that has helped your own healing whether you realize it or not.

Also maybe you never considered it but if everyone bullied the special ed kids and other kids who lived with their grandmother like you did, what does that do to society ? It makes society poorer, bullying victims are cut down and cannot contribute their talents and then that comes back to harm you. It's only shooting yourself in the foot and making a mess that will come to affect you. It may not immediately affect you in a bad way but eventually it will. And also the teachers did you a disservice by tolerating your bullying. They should know that it would be you destroying society for yourself and hurting yourself and was a form of self harm and self destruction and have stopped you for your own good. A lot of kids are going to school and learning to bully and get away with it and then they are learning to destroy things for themselves in life later on. And no one helps them to stop self destructing and self harming in this way. And often the teachers seem to think its only the victim that suffers, so then the kids who are bullying they have no one to tell them the truth that it is they who will suffer and who are destroying society for themselves. It's quite sad.

So it's very smart and wise that you stopped and somehow you came to that conclusion on your own or felt some measure of conscience but however you did that, it has certainly benefited you and it was a wise decision. I'm sure you are also farther along on your road to healing as well because of it."

I guess the thing is that often the oppressed people are always mistakenly seen as bad eg the welfare mothers and poor or even women of colour are regularly seen as lazy and basically it’s because society has to have justifications floated around for why abused and oppressed people are doing badly and in order to get to continue abusing abusers know people will notice that the victim is not going well and want to ask why so they have to convince people that something is wrong with the victim, they are bad or lazy or mentally ill or genetically inferior and their misery is self created so that people stop asking questions and exploring what’s going on with the victim. Oppressed people groups are regularly painted as villains so in a sense it makes sense to be skeptical about anyone who is called a villain it can actually make you less gullible.

That’s damaging to society that some men are allowed to do this and it’s making the GDP drop while a lot of people focus on calling the women who didn’t leave “sick” for not leaving or contacting their abuser again.

Like crushing half of your team makes quarantining and losing income more easy. After you beat up your wife and beat her down how is that going to help you get more money ?

Yes, when you watch someone crush their own kids (or women or people of colour or poor people) and you don't crush your own and your own are growing strong and theirs are growing weak and that person is now getting less than you, then you feel you are getting bigger than them and will get to dominate them, your team is getting more strong and they and their team are getting more weak. ""Never interrupt your enemy when they are making a mistake"", why would you stop them when they are weakening themselves ? (Not to mention when you can gain even more of their liking and trust by encouraging them in the self harm they are doing.) And you get to do all this while looking squeaky clean and making them feel good and pretending to be their friend. You tell them what they want to hear and what makes them feel really good while quietly watching them self destruct. Abusers feel good when other people support them in abusing their kids or wife or poor people or people of colour or their society, like it strokes their ego. They think they get to have power, they get to be better and feel better, they think you're making them feel super special that they get to dominate and be on top and they are special to get to abuse their women or kids this way and get their actions defended and their selfishness defended. They think they are getting ""more for me"" and getting allowed to take an extra large share of the pie so they feel special, they don't see your sabotage. You don't have to lose their liking to keep enabling them in self harm this way. Actually they often like you even better while you are doing them harm, they think you are their best friend. It's totally devious.

People who dislike other people, especially people who really dislike them and really want to destroy them are not going to be outright about it. Being outright that you dislike someone, what is that a 2 year old level ? Who comes out and openly says they dislike someone especially when you don't have that much power over them yet ? I mean it makes the target more vulnerable to you if they think you are their friend, then their walls will be down with you and you can get in and really attack them. People seem to think that everyone who dislikes them and wants to dominate them is going to be outright about it.

>So, enablers watch abusers destroy themselves and that gives them a power high. Makes sense. After every lashing out the abusers are weaker.

Yes, abusers can never have a team that's why they are weak and gullible, they destroy every team. They are the ultimate lone wolves. Look if you are an abuser and you have a team with another person and you have to always dominate everyone an be better, then guess what you are crushing half of your team so you are half as strong as you could be, if it's your wife and kids, you are crushing maybe even 3/4 of your team. Get them to have a scapegoat. Get them to feel better than at least someone and need to be better than someone. Then they are dividing themselves and are weakened. So they are weak, and people who want them to be weak watch with quiet glee while they destroy every team they join by trying to be better and with their nastiness. They are on their own. They don't have a snowball's chance in hell. Actually once you know they are crushing themselves in this way you can even give them some other ""help"" and look like their friend and be confident that in spite of your help they will still be crushed because it's a small amount of help, but the way they are crushing themselves is so overwhelmingly powerful at keeping them weak.

>I have flashbacks of the time I was abused and of the time I abused. Both have traumatized me, and both have weakened me.

That's true, both have weakened you. Being weakened by being abused you did not have a choice over but being weakened by abusing others you did have a choice over.

>I still have a lot of amends to do. Ugh, my guilt hit me again. Anyway. You gave a lot of food for thought. Especially about the domination... I was always curious how that works. My sister and I we both grew up in similar surroundings, yet I turned out kind and she a monster.

It makes it less likely that they will get better, so anyone encouraging and excusing them in hurting others is not their friend, they are helping them stay in pain and don't truly have empathy with them. That's a fake friend. That's enabling and they don't want them to get better or out of their oppression. If they were a true friend and had empathy with them, they would direct them to be kind to children and women and other underdogs and help them improve themselves. People who don't direct them to be kind to children, women, the poor, people of colour, the disabled etc don't have actual empathy with them. That's fake friendship and fake empathy. It's actually a power play to try to get more power over someone, pretend to be their friend and to be committed to them, fake empathy and care, so that they will care for you and fight for you but don't actually care for them and fight for them and don't actually empathize with them. Pretend to care and reciprocate so that they give to you but don't give back to them. That's what it is when people enable. Enabling is not love. A lot of people sadly like to be liked so they pretend to be people's friends but they are just doing things to get that person to like them and be popular and gain social/political power, they don't truly like that other person back that much or really want to give to them or tell them the truth when it involves sacrificing some of that person's liking for them. (btw A lot of ""feminism"" and ""anti racism"" and even ""socialism"" devolved into a power play this way, where people just got enabled to destroy themselves. They had fake friends. And people who wanted them as oppressed groups to stay oppressed while being popular and pretending to be their friends, so they told enabled them in hurting themselves to keep them oppressed. Remember being an oppressed group, many people don't like you they want you to stay oppressed, they are going to do everything they can to undercut you, that's how an oppression works.) They don't tell them when they are hurting their kids that that's wrong and isn't going to work out for them. That would involve being a giving person and telling someone something that will help them but may make then dislike you in the moment. It's much easier to go along and not risk that person being angry at you and keep them liking you and just watch them hurting themselves.

Also I think people who try to in turn dominate children or others with even less power than them, they may have pain and oppression but that instinct to dominate that was always in their character anyway. They are two separate things. There are people with oppression and pain who are kind people, and there are people with oppression and pain who are nasty people (and they are less likely to ""recover"" or get out of their oppression). They are not doing that meanness and nastiness because they were oppressed. Many people have no pain or little oppression and just have the urge to dominate others. Being under oppression doesn't make you into a nasty person, if you are that way under oppression you probably were that way to begin with and sad to say if you get out of your oppression you will still be nasty that way because it's a choice to be nasty and that's what you want to do."

I'm sure that is true at time, though also I wonder if this is how it appears to some men though who don't like when women seem to know too much or who feel threatened. To them we seem like we have an attitude because they are uncomfortable or what we are doing is causing discomfort/hurting. (Similarly women can be biased towards other women as well and it can work the same, if you want to be better than another person when you don't get that it's irritating/""it's stepping on toes"".)

Numbers wise when you think about it, it's like a strategy of war for someone who is not that strong to take down a vast number/amount of people and conquer them each one at a time when if they had seen that you were a bully coming for them at the end they together could have all easily fought you and won, and overpowered you no problem, you actually had much much less power than them. You hide your intentions that you hate them all and bully one at the time and crush one at a time, get them to abandon each other one victim (or victim group) at a time and all your victims could have easily overpowered you, but they didn't care about each other and were happy to each abandon each other and sacrifice each other and then at the end that's how incredibly you overpowered people with vastly more power than you and they are all crushed when had they stood together they could have easily resisted you. That's why being a bystander to bullying does not work out and is the opposite of what one should be doing to protect oneself from bullying and being bullied. Contrary to popular thought standing up when someone weaker is bullied (rather than what we are regularly taught ""mind your own business"" ""it's not your fight, don't bother yourself"") is a strategy to protect yourself from bullying later and from the bully gaining enough power to come after you later. Somehow also people seem to be so bad at reading the bully's intentions that it was not just the present victim that they were going after and hated, they also hated the bystanders or bullying helpers and intended to eventually go after and crush them too. Someone who intends to bully you later once they take down other weaker people is not going to be up front with you about their intentions and tell you they intend to bully you later when you can still overpower them. They will only reveal their intentions to bully you and hate for you when they have more power than you and can overpower you.

The kind people to the bullying victims were the most likely to protect themselves from bullying later."

If they had felt it was wrong to rape in the first place and felt guilt, they wouldn't have raped. They have to have a sense of entitlement to rape and think that is their right, so when a victim dares protest they get angry at having their rights to rape infringed upon. How evil of the victims and society to try to hold them accountable! Remember Weinstein did the same thing.

LifeProTips,fkekr7e,t1_fkc1urt,1584115205.0,">Your empathy sentence is quite correct, though! I feel very deep empathy, especially for children, although I am not good at showing it.

Yes (and good for you if you have that you will go far in life and that will make you less gullible), but the the thing is that sometimes they/you aren't even good at showing their emotions to themselves, it's more in the unconscious. I read that sometimes people with aspergers also seem to get upset when someone else is upset even though they don't consciously realize either that the other person is upset or that they are getting upset in response so it doesn't seem that people with aspergers strictly have trouble reading others' emotions more that they don't have conscious access to some of that information about others' emotional states that they are taking in and reacting too, nor do they have conscious access to their reactions/emotional state.

I'm so sorry to hear that you are part of the child sexual abuse statistic. I hope that you got justice for your abuse. I'm not really surprised that girls with aspergers have higher rates of child sexual abuse but also correlation is not causation. 

And I think that even if girls with autism have higher rates of child sexual abuse, given the inability to read social cues I think that the rates of abuse should actually be expected to be much much much higher than what they are in someone that has trouble reading social cues (like 10x higher or 100x higher). I think that if someone couldn't read the signs of a predator due to brain mis-wiring truly their rates of abuse would be much much much higher.

Girls with autism can on occasion protect themselves from abuse actually much better and feel something is off about abusers even when they don't know consciously better than other girls without autism who survived a lot more abuse. So I tend to feel that there is more going on and that there are some more issues with this idea than what meets the eye at first. There is a complex negotiation in sizing up a person and a lot of it is unconscious. This is similar to how many men ""with autism"" tried to buy sex because people told them that's the solution to their woman troubles but just couldn't bring themselves to do it and couldn't explain why, they couldn't consciously or logically tell you why it was wrong, they just felt it was wrong and knew it was wrong. A lot of these ideas of ""autism"" are very simplistic and there is a lot more going on than what meets the eye."

Don't you worry, ironically sadly they will probably now be doing the opposite, a section on the luxurious bunkers on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and everyone will be fawning over it like having a private jet or Birkin bag, what matters is status and hierarchy and being better than others not objectively doing well, having nice things, staying alive and having an intact earth for your children to stay alive. It will be the status symbol of a luxury bunker while the entire earth gets destroyed, because being better and showing off your money and having status or admiring those with status is what's most important. It makes no difference if you inherit literally all the gold on the earth if there are only 100 people left (or even a million left for that matter) and there is no one to make new Netflix series (all those ones and movies of your favourite books you were looking forward to watching forget that), and no researchers to find a cure to diseases, no scientific discoveries, no better or faster jets (in 50 years their jets will be 50 years old with no updates, it would be like billionaires today flying a jet from the 1970s, because the climate change or income inequality/wealth distribution (with everyone else but the super rich dying) apocalypse took place then and killed almost everyone else and they couldn't get any updates since then), a shortened lifespan.

I recently read an article on how the rich are buying designer hand sanitizers like Byredo for $50 and getting special arrangements at restaurants which was so off the wall that I couldn't figure out whether it was tongue in cheek or not. Sadly your life is literally in danger, you are stocking up on toilet paper for the apocalypse and you are worried about whether your hand sanitizer is classy and the rich people kind or not ? You can just hear some unfortunate people reading the article saying to themselves, ""Oh they have money! That's the classy way to handle an epidemic. The rich way to handle an epidemic!"" and copiously taking notes. Conspicuous consumption and status awareness and anxiety when your life is literally in danger is sadly the real danger to your life. If you want the nice smelling hand sanitizer that's fine but money and being in awe of the super rich is not the only thing that matters in life especially when it comes to preserving your life.

Edited to add: Did you see the recent report that 50% of the world's coral reefs are going to be destroyed in the next few decades due to climate change ? Once it was a middle class thing to enjoy and now it looks like it's going to become a status symbol only for the super rich. The value of the thing itself and the experience isn't increasing or decreasing, it's just becoming more scarce as we destroy the world with climate change and more of a status symbol. Is this what we want ? Does this make sense ? We can get objectively poorer and have objectively less but have more status and be more dominant ? (It's just like how WW1 and WW2 decimated the truffle forests and now there are basically none left so it has become more of a status symbol.)"
ptsd,fk7g4r0,t1_fhel7kf,1583935737.0,"She’s not remotely damaged and neither are you. Anyone telling you that you are or are in any way less than is not in touch with reality. An oppression is not a sickness and believing that it is and putting the problem with the victim means that people are not working on the oppression and soon it can come to harm them too. The more people consider rape victims sick rather than oppressed the farther and farther the rapists are going to go and the more men and women are going to get raped and raped to the level of severity that your partner was. People cannot just brush problems under the rug and pretend that they fixed the problem by calling victims sick, that is a gullible thing to do. That’s sticking your head in the sand and playing games with yourself which does not leave you in a strong position. Rape is not a disorder or sickness but an oppression and if you can both mutually understand that and support each other in that, when the rest of the world is brainwashed into thinking it’s something to pull up your bootstraps about or something that is a sickness and is wrong with the victim, then you can go far together. (And actually even non rape victims who can get more in touch with reality can go far, being not in touch with reality does not work out for people and is maiming them and keeping them from going far. I don’t know why people think that being in untruth and non realism based perspective that victims are sick or damaged rather than oppressed is going to work out for them. It does not matter if everyone else is not in touch with the truth or jumping off of a cliff it’s not going to work out for you if you do too.) People sadly have been heavily heavily propagandized and brainwashed that rape is a sickness and is something wrong with the victim. People need to question why they were so heavily propagandized that something is wrong with the victims. It’s because it’s an attack and this was in fact done to attack them as bystanders and as a society. The sooner they recognize this as bystander and a society  and get out of it the better. And people who love themselves more are going to do this and resist the brainwashing more. You seem to be someone that loves yourself more.

Also even if you weren’t a rape victim or even if she wasn’t you all would still gain a lot by seeing the other person as not damaged and being in touch with reality. People have been heavily brainwashed to be against rape victims and to be against incest survivors because being in that state and believing that there is something wrong with victims makes them gullible, weak and easy to crush. People need to be kept being nasty to victims and believing something is wrong with them in order to keep them as a society weak. It’s a very bad idea for society and it’s part of the reason that the Epstein honeypot blackmail racket went on for so long and has now damaged everyone by fueling climate change, income inequality, wars, racism, anti immigrant sentiment, loss of trust in the political system and loss of women’s rights. People are paying a real price for the hate and seeing the victims as sick and some people have already paid with their lives due to the income inequality or the effects of the political honeypot blackmail on the working of and trust of democracy  and if this continues more people will pay with their lives. This is not working out for anyone. The victims could not come forward and complain because of the stigma on rape victims and the thinking that it was a sickness. Maybe some of them are now successful professionals and they felt doing so would destroy their career and ability to contribute. They would be seen as a sex object all the more.

I don’t think it’s the best way to go about building a healthy relationship that, “We are both damaged so we are both only the best that each other can do” (though granted you didn’t say that, you don’t said you were damaged too when the other person kept pushing the perspective that she was damaged and you did say that you actually consider her understanding of your oppression an asset rather than a flaw), you should be with someone who thinks you are the best and thinks you deserve the best (not a broken person) and so should she. You and she would still be a catch even to people who were not under a similar oppression. That’s reality and we all need to stay in touch with reality for our own best interests. The more in touch with reality we are the better we can do things that benefit us. In my opinion sadly the people who are not a catch are those who think that something is wrong with rape victims or sick and less good about them. They have a lot of problems. They are inside a viewpoint that is not working for them, is unfortunately harming them and they are not in touch with reality and are in a state of self harm and self destruction. They are making a mess for themselves. They are discrediting victims, disempowering victims so that they can’t fight back against the oppression and they are not fighting the oppression but reinforcing it so that we can get more and more victims and victims of even worse. They are in a vulnerable state because while they are crushing victims from fighting back against the oppression it can get worse and then come to harm them too or cause political problems that harm them too. Also a lot of people other than victims gained something from being together with victims professionally and giving them a seat at the table. They have a diversity of perspective to offer in a sense and beyond that objectively speaking there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. They are under an oppression not sick or damaged. That’s reality. Victims beyond being great partners are also far more than just viable partners. That’s the truth if you want to live in line with the truth and see things as they are."

TwoXChromosomes,fjtkv81,t3_fev2by,1583608710.0,"Men who are sexually and physically developed but with mental developmental delays can rape. Just like they can hit people or kill people in anger (maybe without a high level of intellectual understanding) they do have a sex drive (unlike a child like your son), they may be mentally underdeveloped but they are physically and sexually developed and they can rape or sexually harass. He might be at the same mental level as your son or even beneath where your son is at but he does have an understanding of how sex works and of dominating people with sex/how sexual abuse works that your son doesn't. He understands that sex is something like a knife and that it can cut someone or it's hard like a heavy stone and can be used to hit someone, hurt someone or make them uncomfortable. It doesn't take that much intelligence to figure out that you can take a heavy object and fling it at them and hurt them, that's like a four year old level of intelligence if that. Similarly it does not take that much intelligence once you have gone through puberty to understand that sex is like a heavy object you can fling at someone and hurt them. Your son on the other hand (not having gone through puberty) doesn't understand sex this way that it's like a heavy object that can be flung at someone to hurt them or express love.

It doesn't take that much intelligence to rape or sexually abuse a child. (Believe me it's not like rapists have made some great professional achievement doing something that was so difficult to do and took a lot of skill or knowledge or figured out something so complex. It's very easy and cowardly to sexually prey on someone weaker, and often some people who can't take on anyone their own size cowardly go and attack someone weaker.

ptsd,fjkfxq0,t1_fia3iel,1583426136.0,"I would stop talking about human coldness and start talking about human gullibility and weakness because that’s what lack of empathy for the poor/homeless/women is and that's what snobbiness is, a severe weakness and vulnerability. This is a very unsafe and dangerous state for them to be in to take this worldview.  And that’s why people are being propagandized to be this way to keep them weak and exploitable. People who hate the poor and women can be crushed at the drop of a hat. Bullies and hierarchical people, contrary to popular opinion, are very gullible. The talk about human coldness unfortunately has gotten us less than nowhere almost the more people talk about it from a moral perspective the more it is taken as playing games and the speaker virtue signalling to aggrandize themselves. So unfortunately almost no one feels anything from talk about morals anymore. And the people who don’t have empathy with the underdogs (and the parents of teenagers like this) probably already know it’s not empathetic and it’s cold and I think sadly often this has not been enough to motivate them to change course.

The kinder teenagers/people who care about the poor or rape victims or abuse victims are more likely to leave a social safety net that will protect them if they ever fall, even if intellectually they never anticipate needing it, just because they are tender hearted to the poor and homeless and feel bad for them even when they are being propagandized that their misery is self created. They are less gullible. And they are more set up to succeed. They are also less likely to see the poor as disordered or sick or as mentally ill and creating their own misery when they have empathy and feel tender hearted towards them and are more likely to work on the oppression and stop the income inequality before it reaches them. It is hard to convince people who are tender hearted that someone’s misery is self created and they are sick or mentally ill, they are more likely to see that person as oppressed rather than sick. It is harder to convince them to use punitive or controlling measures on that person “for their own good.” The people who love the poor and women and abuse survivors are a big problem for those who want to further the income inequality because they are seeing them as oppressed rather than sick and fighting the oppression from the start before they ever are touched by suffering income inequality or abuse or homelessness or rape too. They fight the problem before it reaches them when they have a chance to save themselves. They are just less gullible and less vulnerable. When you are victim blaming people for their own misery and inside of a just world fallacy where anyone who fails or is crushed by oppression is mentally ill or sick it is a state of gullibility and vulnerability. Then those problems/oppressions can hit you too because you denied them and called the victims mentally ill or sick. It is being in an exploitable and gullible state. Bad things are happening that can come your way and instead of fighting the increasing oppression you are sticking your head in the sand saying that they must have created their own misery because they are mentally ill. People in this state are easy to crush.

The teenagers who do not look out for the homeless, the poor and women and veterans and the sick and hate them, somehow their parents and others have done them a disservice in life. Sadly they are being set up for failure. It’s in their best interest to empathize with these people.

Also I'm not trying to judge but I want to point out that people who are inside of this very materialistic viewpoint have a lot of difficulty empathizing with the rich. They can only see people's material possessions, they don't think that the rich can have abuse or cancer or pain. It doesn't quite seem real to them because money is the ultimate measure of success. They can't quite conceive of the rich as vulnerable to empathize with them if they are sick or dying because they view them as so invulnerable that they practically seem immortal. It's hard for them to see this person is a mere mortal too whose life is in danger, whether from cancer or a physical illness or from something like child abuse. All they can see and what they would focus on is the material possessions like the designer clothes, yatchs and jets. They would be totally distracted by this and in this viewpoint and worldview money makes all things good and takes away all pains so it's hard to empathize with the rich from that standpoint when you think that money is the ultimate solution. The people who probably have the most empathy towards the rich and would empathize the most with them when they are in pain are ironically the socialists who do not get too distracted by money or material possessions. To those who are focused on money and material possessions and very absorbed by these things, it probably doesn't quite seem real that the rich can be sick or dying or suffering or bleed. In this viewpoint whenever you have pain, you just look at your money and your jets and multimillion dollar mansions and feel better no matter what the pain. OK maybe they don't think they quite so literally but in their subconscious this is truly  how they think the world and having money works. It's 95% of your life's ills solved. Whatever else can go wrong it's not as big of a deal. I think that they are so focused on money this way because they often think you can always console yourself with your money if you are rich. The rich become godlike which perhaps some might take as a compliment but if one is dying or hurt or sick and needs empathy and someone to see your vulnerability being seen as practically immortal and invulnerable can make it hard to get empathy from those around you or make it hard for them to see what dire straits you are in. That’s a hard situation to be in."

The first step to fixing the problem is recognizing and admitting the problem. Although this might seem slightly off topic, I’m pasting a post of mine from /r/latestagecapitalism yesterday since I think you might find it encouraging. 

“Jeff Bezos has more money than he can spend in probably 150 lifetimes. There's nothing more he can possibly buy. He can already afford everything. It's not as if, ""I just need another million to buy the better house or now I can also buy a jet."" Having all of this money is literally making him poorer not richer. And every time he gets a new billion he is literally getting poorer rather than richer. In the hands of other people this money could lead to creativity and a life saving or prolonging discovery or better food, science, medicines, music, art and better things for him to buy, it could actually improve his life now by creating something better than what is out there. In his hands the money isn't benefiting him. He can already afford anything in the world and the best in the world that's available, at least in the hands of someone else keeping them alive or getting them educated it might produce better art or something more for him to buy and some new discovery. It makes no sense for him to keep gathering more and more money particularly at the expense of other people, if more people get sick and can't afford their medical bills or die or can't get educated then that's less people to invent and produce new art and science and yatchs for him to buy.

Put another way if everyone but you on earth and 100 people died (or were starving/ill or couldn’t get educated) and you all got all the money and gold and wealth to yourselves, that wealth would be useless to you. There would be no one to produce anything for you to buy. No new iphone next year, no new computer, no new medicines in the next ten years, no new science coming out. Nothing more to buy. No new TV shows. There is not going to be anything ""new"" and better coming out for you to want and spend your money on. Money does not have the same value when it's concentrated into the hands of a few.
It makes no sense to me why these super rich people’s armies of helpers helping them amass all this wealth keep doing this since it’s not helping them, they are getting poorer not richer. (Also why are therapists telling people suffering from income inequality that their misery is self created and that they have maladaptive coping and just need some mindfulness and shutting them down from trying to stop the income inequality. They are helping the super rich get poorer too.)

Look capitalism is contributing to climate change and then due to climate change places like mar al largo (sp?) are ending up under water, so all the millions spent on acquiring these places which then end up underwater or destroyed what is the point of this? The same system that lets you acquire it ensures that it is also destroyed.

btw That's ironically what the most disturbing and jarring thing is to me about [CBS's little pie experiment on wealth distribution.](https://www.cbs.com/shows/cbs_this_morning/video/7qsoOCpUsvJicQVaszWVcERqEwTgb72b/americans-know-wealth-inequality-is-a-problem-but-what-does-it-look-like-/)This income distribution is even really bad for the super rich. Their money is pretty much worthless in that distribution when no one on the bottom can even survive to produce anything. This is hurting them. Paying more taxes would benefit them a lot, it would be great if they actually say that, they can say that they want the income redistributed not out of charity but for their own best interests because that's the reality. It won't even mean they have to give up anything in their lifetime because they already have more money than they can spend in at least 10 lifetimes.“

ptsd,fi8twam,t1_fi8pixo,1582248249.0,"I agree. I bet some of Epstein’s victims and Weinstein’s victims (not to mention Saville, Spacey, Sandusky, the Catholic Church priests) ended up poor/homeless due to the abuse and lack of justice and were then seen as bad/immoral whereas he was seen as good and moral because he was rich. Now we are all paying the price for that for the way that meant the victims were probably regarded with contempt for them being in poverty (not to mention being rape victims, the contempt for rape victims and the endless nastiness and hate for rape victims especially those who struggle with “self harm” or being unable to work) and not listened to and he was seen as automatically moral and to be looked up to and respected or even above criticism. He was seen as contributing to society (even as he disrupted democracy with the honey traps and the politicians caught them then doing the bidding of the billionaires and powerful) and the victims seen as detracting from it. He was a success and they were failures. And there were many other ""Epsteins"" in other countries doing the same too probably.

We have to come to terms with the fact that this view of the world is not realism based and is not helping us sort out our problems. It has gotten us into this mess and is going to get us deeper into this mess if we keep going with it including if we keep going with the misogyny. We have already paid a heavy price and we can now pay an even heavier price if we keep going along these lines.

Edited to add: Also what I’m saying is he’s likely the reason that Trump is now in power and is doing all the damage he is doing. Epstein and his honey trap where many of the politicians were under blackmail to do the bidding of the powerful and didn’t/couldn’t serve the people’s interest is part of the reason people lost faith in the political system and voted for Trump and also Epstein’s manipulation can probably be connected to the 2008 financial crash and all the losses of homes and who knows maybe even jobs going overseas and the opiate crisis. And maybe if people hadn’t been looking down on the victims for being poor or failures, and hating women and rape victims so much and had respect for them they would have listened sooner and he would have been held accountable sooner and this honey trap blackmail system of keeping the politicians in check to do the bidding of the powerful would have ended sooner and democracy would have functioned better and less people would have lost their homes or jobs and women wouldn’t have lost as many rights and the climate change wouldn’t be so bad. This victim blaming and playing “the poor pitiful victim” and uncritically equating money with success and morality does have repercussions and we all pay the price. People have paid a heavy heavy price. Hating the poor and rape victims will bring disaster on you and has already. Hate costs you a lot in money, that’s why life is so expensive these days. The only question is whether people want to suffer more and feel more pain or whether they are ready to stop self harming and being in self destruction. People are victimizing themselves with their hate for the poor, child abuse survivors and rape victims. Epstein and the financial income inequality costs could have been avoided or reduced with more care for the poor and rape and abuse victims."
LateStageCapitalism,fi773pj,t1_fi74hbs,1582215644.0,"Yes people should talk to the elites about socialism. They have the power to fix things. If the elites control the media and politics then it’s hard to fight against them and what they see as is in their best interest. They even control many research chairs in psychology/psychiatry so now mindfulness is now “science” and poverty is “trauma” and “social conditioning” not an oppression. Poor kids have “trauma” and “damaged brains” we need to “trauma inform” schools and give them therapy for their poverty brain damage not work on the income inequality and give everyone some DBT to regulate their emotions and help them cope better if poverty is pushing them over the edge and teach them mindfulness. Homelessness is now a psychological disorder to be fixed with their behavioural therapies rather than due to poverty/racism/sexism. You should go on the /r/suicidewatch subreddit and see the nonsense. They have shamelessly and outright forbidden anyone from discussing politics. Everyone dying from the income inequality is just sick and needs therapy. Also go on the /r/bpd or r/dbtselfhelp sub and see how they are beating up suicidal women and pushing them over the edge and into prostitution which then worsens the income inequality.

Why are these therapists helping Jeff Bezos and the multi billionaires destroy everything for themselves and helping them get poorer not richer ? Anyone who screams in pain from what they are doing is diagnosed with a disorder and seen as sick. Why are the politicians helping them get poorer not richer ? Why are religious ministers of all religions (including philosophies like stoicism) crushing the poor with non realism based ideas and hopes of the afterlife, cutting people down from protesting the income inequality with the opiate of the people and giving them the ""prosperity gospel"" which again equates wealth and health with morality ? Meanwhile the climate change marches on and Bezos gets another billion dollars that can’t even buy him anything new and the same for Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and all the other multi billionaires. They are literally getting poorer not richer. What is the point to all of this?"
LateStageCapitalism,fi6xj7t,t3_f6acdt,1582209797.0,"Jeff Bezos has more money than he can spend in probably 150 lifetimes. There's nothing more he can possibly buy. He can already afford everything. It's not as if, ""I just need another million to buy the better house or now I can also buy a jet."" Having all of this money is literally making him poorer not richer. And every time he gets a new billion he is literally getting poorer rather than richer. In the hands of other people this money could lead to creativity and a life saving or prolonging discovery or better food, science, medicines, music, art and better things for him to buy, it could actually improve his life now by creating something better than what is out there. In his hands the money isn't benefiting him. He can already afford anything in the world and the best in the world that's available, at least in the hands of someone else keeping them alive or getting them educated it might produce better art or something more for him to buy and some new discovery. It makes no sense for him to keep gathering more and more money particularly at the expense of other people, if more people get sick and can't afford their medical bills or die or can't get educated then that's less people to invent and produce new art and science and yatchs for him to buy.

Put another way if everyone but you on earth and 100 people died (or were starving/ill or couldn’t get educated) and you all got all the money and gold and wealth to yourselves, that wealth would be useless to you. There would be no one to produce anything for you to buy. No new iphone next year, no new computer, no new medicines in the next ten years, no new science coming out. Nothing more to buy. No new TV shows. There is not going to be anything ""new"" and better coming out for you to want and spend your money on. Money does not have the same value when it's concentrated into the hands of a few.

It makes no sense to me why these super rich people’s armies of helpers helping them amass all this wealth keep doing this since it’s not helping them, they are getting poorer not richer. (Also why are therapists telling people suffering from income inequality that their misery is self created and that they have maladaptive coping and just need some mindfulness and shutting them down from trying to stop the income inequality. They are helping the super rich get poorer too.)

Look capitalism is contributing to climate change and then due to climate change places like mar al largo (sp?) are ending up under water, so all the millions spent on acquiring these places which then end up underwater or destroyed what is the point of this? The same system that lets you acquire it ensures that it is also destroyed. 

btw That's ironically what the most disturbing and jarring thing is to me about CBS's little pie experiment on wealth distribution. This income distribution is even really bad for the super rich. Their money is pretty much worthless in that distribution when no one on the bottom can even survive to produce anything. This is hurting them. Paying more taxes would benefit them a lot, it would be great if they actually say that, they can say that they want the income redistributed not out of charity but for their own best interests because that's the reality. It won't even mean they have to give up anything in their lifetime because they already have more money than they can spend in at least 10 lifetimes."
LateStageCapitalism,fi5bria,t3_f6b3em,1582159475.0,Really ? It's all fake ?
BPD,fi4i4vn,t1_fi4hsll,1582141652.0,"Either it's a bad choice (which is judgemental) or else it's capitulation and it's not their fault and not something they have control over and can't stop.

How do you know that justice will not bring relief to their pain ? Have you ever tried giving them justice.

Also this dominating/bullying way you are acting with me is not going to help you get out of your oppression. It's not going to work out for you and the worse a situation you are in the more it's not going to work out for you. Kindness to the underdogs gives you the best prognosis for getting better."
BPD,fi4h7ih,t1_fi4gwdj,1582141126.0,"I didn't mean to come across as judgemental or shaming. I don't think there is any shame in being a victim or in cutting. It is definitely a way to cope with the pain and one that people are forced into and you're right seeking relief from the pain is completely valid. Did I tell her to stop ? I said that the solution was for people to give her justice, if they want her to stop why don't they give her justice."
TwoXChromosomes,fi4dyq4,t1_fi4d85p,1582139257.0,Oh I see. No I didn't mean it was on OP or something she did wrong.
BPD,fi4cy11,t1_fi4btrk,1582138662.0,Evidently someone else disagrees since I was upvoted.
ptsd,fi47wdv,t3_f6cpw5,1582135758.0,I’m sorry to hear that. That sounds tough. I will think twice about going up to pet people’s friendly dogs in the street now. I hope you are OK.
TwoXChromosomes,fi47bxz,t1_fi47517,1582135429.0,Oh ? Why do you say so? I didn’t say she should have held him accountable I said someone should have held him accountable and that would have been better for everyone. I would think that would be encouraging to her.
