popheads,f7a4o51,t3_dup6o5,1573520276.0,Melodrama has defined pop for me.
brockhampton,ewnls8q,t3_cp1khm,1565582077.0,"I will be honest and say that iridescence is the album which made me a fan of theirs. The Saturation projects have their place but SAN MARCOS and FABRIC have such anthemic swell that just clicks emotionally with me and lyrics that make me feel heard.
'You don't understand why I can't get up and shout'"
popheads,ew5i68r,t3_cmvn68,1565136867.0,All the stars (Kendrick and SZA) that chorus with SZA singing and the distorted Kendrick singing 'HAUNT' just makes me feel at ease.

depression,ew1grg8,t3_cm28m0,1565023056.0,I remember having this feeling of 'spiralling ' when I stopped trusting the only bunch of people(2) I usually hang out with (It maybe was due to me being oversensitive /shrug). I become so scared of talking/thinking anything about them as I believe that I might jinx something and they will stop talking to me or I will stop talking to them.

Every Open Eye -> Love is Dead.
While it would be dishonest of me to suggest that I don't enjoy some of the latter (Never Say Die, My Enemy, Get Out, Wonderland), Every Open Eye is just a classic album for me."
