I see more value in the accident coverage that they offer over medical, so you're at least covered if your dog gets hit by a car or the fees relating to a lost dog. Those at least aren't limited to arbitrary breed lists, but probably wpuldnt be worth the cost after a successful claim."

One argument that can be made is that the blanket policies themselves are unfair. Instead of hearing out individual employees about their needs, they say that all parents can work from home. Or some have gone as far as paying parents with no work requirements while childfree need to work for their pay from home. 

These blanket policies include those with teenagers that need no supervision, those who have a stay at home spouse, and those that don't have custody of their kids. Unless those people really want to work at the office, they will quietly take the benefit of work from home even though there is no need for them to do so. 

No policy should benefit one group over another. Every decision about who works from home should be based on merit and need. So the policies should be that everyone goes back to the office unless they require accommodation, and then they argue their case to HR. The blanket policy also makes it more awkward and resentful for those who aren't covered to ask for accommodation."

It was a dog show in our small town, very informal, for our local summerfest. Only 4 of us showed up, 3 adults and a kid. The kid just happened to be part of the family that owns the organization running summerfest and their family wins everything every year.

We all go through showing costumes, doing treat catching, and entering as look a like. The kids dog was the least impressive at everything... her costume was a tutu skirt, every else had either elaborate or hand sewn costumes. 

We were all expecting her to get 1st in every category.... but she got 2nd in one, 3rd in another, and didn't even place in the last one. She was so mad that she picked up her dog and pouted off to her parents. My dog won a 1st and 2and prize, the first time my family ever beat the organizers family at something. 

The difference turned out to be that the judge was a pet store owner. She didn't like kids and wasn't going to hand out top awards just because she was a kid.

My dogs have always been lean and trim... until the smallest got sick. He was having seizures regularly and we had to initially decrease physical activity. When he started new medications that came with the side effects of increased appetite and easier weight gain. 

He was 13 pounds when he got sick (healthy) and has been holding steady at 16 ever since he stabilized (overweight). He can't be pushed too hard physically to avoid breakthrough seizures, and from the exercise we have done together, me and the other dog lost a bit of weight, not him. 

Our vet is happy with his weight. They recognize it isn't ideal but they know pushing him too hard to lose it could mean death. So as long as he is eating appropriate portions, moving, and not seizing - they are happy with his health.

I would make sure to keep a meal/symptom diary and take glucose readings if you can. That was really the only thing my doctor could work with considering all tests came back inconclusive.

entitledparents,fnvkhk8,t1_fnu5gvj,1587296635.0,"I evidently went 15 years eating like shit without realizing I had this condition. With diabetes running in my family, they thought I'd be a diabetic for sure. But what I have is reactive hypoglycemia. My poor diet and constant junk eating masked it for years... it was only when I started eating healthy and intermittent fasting that it came out full force. Before I was always hunting for sugar, my body just knew when I felt like shit I needed more sugar. And of course causing a spike when I was dropping would help with the immediate issue.

My doctor can't even officially diagnose it with testing because the 2 hour glucose tolerance test was inconclusive (I crashed 3 hours after consuming the crazy amount of glucose) and he doesn't see the point of a 4 hour test if dietary changes have largely resolved it. Even bloodwork looking at average levels didn't help because on average it is fine... I had to get a monitor and check every single hours for 3 days to see I was going into the 3's and 2's a few hours after eating.

Being hypoglycemic isn't noticeable to me... I can be in the 2's and not notice. It is the fall from a spike to below normal levels that I can pick up on. Sometimes it is intense  (like 0-100 in a minute) or gradual (over 15 minutes). Sometimes I feel awful and other times it is just a headache, blurred vision, hot flashes, dizziness, or a stomach ache. 

Right now I need to eat a small meal every 3 hours with low sugar (aim for 3g max) with fiber and protein. So a lot of veggies, whole wheat, meats. If I cheat by sneaking in a cookie or chocolate, it can kick my ass. I'll start feeling bad within a couple of hours and the feeling can stick around for half a day to a few days. Like right now I'm on day 2 of a headache because I stole a handful of lucky charms and ate a cookie.

If it wasn't for the diet changes that triggered more dramatic symptoms, I never would have been given a solution to my ongoing issues. I was always loosing focus at school or work and needed snacks to eventually get going again... I thought I just lacked discipline and changed my entire career path because of that.

But I would encourage anyone to give the diet a shot if they find sugar or junk foods are throwing them off. The sugar withdrawals are rough, but I largely don't crave for any snacks anymore. The diet itself is just general healthy eating that regulates blood sugar."

He pulled through but apparently had 3 heart attacks that day. I overheard that from her gossiping with her friends... I was never told. But she did make sure to guilt trip me for not visiting. 

Thing is she told us he was being flown out and would update us. So why would we rush the 30 minute drive to the hospital? She never told us he'd be moved 3 hours later, she never told us we could visit... if he had died she would've rubbed my face in it that I wasn't there."

I'm not trying to be fanatical but the past is not a promise for the future. We don't know what path this will take and what normal will look like. People are insisting that schools won't stay closed and social distancing has to be lifted, not because of science, but because it is too inconvenient for them. 

I have a coworker who is distraught because the schools won't open at the start of May and believes they should open anyways because ""this can't go on much longer"". Her beliefs are fully based on how the change has inconvenienced her family. It has to go back to normal because that is how it was before. She was fine with a few weeks of her kids being home with her, but now that it isn't fun, it needs to be switched back. Despite this she is still earning a 6 figure salary working from home... 

But the point I really want people to get is that things can change despite how inconvenient the change might be. Embrace the changes in place for now and learn how to live with them in case some of them become the new normal. Nothing HAS to to back to the way it was just because that is how it was.

Dogs don't even get a say in the matter, we pick them based on a variety of reasons.

Dogs are all individuals, yes they carry the traits of their breed (with many unknown mixes), but some are also assholes. You can do the most research and make a well informed decision, but somewhere down the line it may not be working. Continuing the relationship isn't fair to the human or dog. Responsibly rehoming should be applauded, not shamed."

That just means she is a strong independent woman that doesn't need her human to hold her paw. Her medical appointment is her business.

Dogs 10/10 think they have won the war."

Trades should be switched to on call only based on emergency or essential calls. Stores shut down to all customers with special contact/order procedures for emergency or essential supplies. Any administrative work should be strictly work from home, anything that needs to be physically done in office should be limited to certain days, not full staffs in the office for a regular workweek. 

It sickens me to see people browsing at Home Depot picking up supplies for home renos or decorating projects. Or people at best buy looking for video games... this was not the spirit of the changes."
