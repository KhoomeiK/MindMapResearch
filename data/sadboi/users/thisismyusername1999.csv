I’ve been trying to educate myself more as before last week I knew nothing about IBS.
It’s still crazy to me that something like fruits that are supposed to be good foods and we are told to eat more of can be triggers for so much discomfort."
LifeProTips,fqgsd8c,t3_git7cw,1589355553.0,"Angel. I work in a call centre and and get comments on my name through the day. At least once a day I get the sleazy “Are you an angel?” “Oh you must be an angel?” You speak like an angel do you look like one too?” “Did you fall from heaven?” 

People ask me in person if I’m religious or if there’s a special reason behind my name as I have a weird middle name too.
I am now convinced that my mum just named me after a character called Angel from Home and Away after my boyfriend pointing out the possibility."

AskReddit,fbovzf1,t3_ee3azf,1577015053.0,"I like tattoos. It’s your skin and you can do what you like although it can prevent you getting a job. 

Saying that, theres plenty of people in my job that have sleeves and tattoos up to their hands. Also piercings  (eyebrow, nose, tongue etc). I work in an office environment. I got my first tattoo when I was just barely a teenager, I have another big demon tattoo,  a bad swear word and my boyfriends name tattooed for a laugh.  I have been asked to cover up my bad word tattoo as it is visible.

At the end of the day you aren’t permanent and neither is your skin so if you want a tattoo or piercing get one! 
Depending on what country you live in and where you get your tattoo it can be very difficult getting a job. Where I live as long as your dream job doesn’t prevent you getting tattoos then you shouldn’t have any problems. As long as you don’t get hundreds of face piercings  and tattoos that make you look like a pure goth you should be fine."

Advice,fazm16m,t1_faxpgxm,1576417506.0,Thanks for offering your help yeah that was probably the best thing. I’m not too knowledgeable on what services there are in the area. I believe the best bet was the town he was in as there were options available for him. Unfortunately he was quite keen on getting in the car with us! My other friend had also mentioned a shelter that was apparently quite nearby set up in a church or town hall at night but he wasn’t too keen. He seemed quite happy and pleased to be dropped at the McDonald’s.
Advice,fazjzmj,t1_faxif2h,1576416892.0,"Thank you, at the time I thought I should have called them as I was concerned for his safety as the Scottish winter weather isn’t the kindest. 
Although we dropped him somewhere where he could be warm and get some food it occurred to me when I got home that there wasn’t much around it as it was an industrial estate at 2am. If he was to be asked to leave the McDonald’s he wouldn’t have much places to go. He seemed high or drunk so he could have stumbled in front of a car near the motorway or even forgot where he was and how to get back. 

As for the hats scarf etc he seemed sorted. He had on an expensive winter coat, had quite a bit of cash on him, and as a man at the taxi rank pointed out, looked quite clean shaven for a homeless guy. He just had no place to stay.
Just hope his night turned out ok and he managed to find where he needed to be. Thank you for helping."
Advice,fazgbw2,t1_faxc57v,1576415810.0,"Thank you, I feel like the wrong call was made and looking back we weren’t doing the man any favours. If he had stayed in the main town he would have had options to shelters and transport in the morning if he needed. 
It was unwise of us to take a random bloke in the taxi who looking back was probably just as out his nut as we were.
We felt like we were being helpful in our intoxicated state but we were doing more damage than good. Thank you for offering your help! Im just seeing this now forgot I even wrote this!"

AskReddit,fa7u3d8,t3_e7yfsz,1575838205.0,"Call centre advisor! A lot of people who work with me say the job is shite, boring and underpaid but I’m content with the job I do. 
It pays above minimum wage, the people are good and the hours are ideal for me. 
There have been plenty of times I have cried at my job however I wouldn’t be able to handle working in retail, hospitality or any other job where you are constantly dealing with customers face to face.
I am a shy and awkward person most of the times with issues with anxiety and depression and although I may be capable of doing something more, I am happy in my current role. I do the best I can at my job and then clock out and go home. 
I’m just happy I have a job I can sustain and pretty much everyone is friendly. In all the jobs I’ve had this is my favourite and for once I actually look forward to going to my work."

I started drinking those yoghurt drink things today after advice from the internet so I will drink more hopefully that works. I have been advised to go back to the doctor tomorrow if I still can’t poop as I’ve been given a shit load more laxatives and I’ve been taking them for a week now and nothing is happening.
