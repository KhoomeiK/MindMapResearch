SeriousConversation,fqzo9yu,t1_fqzaba8,1589771620.0,"You said its bad that they depend on luck, and deserving people, who deserves to have that life? You havent said who deserves that life.

&#x200B;

In life you deserve what you negotiate, or earn what you negotiate, 

&#x200B;

Second you said 

 ""It's bad for these things to depend any more than necessary on luck, ""

But its not luck, beleive it or not, and its not privileige either.

My grand father lived in a factory town, and worked hard, manual labour included, eventually he ralized that working for others had no future, he started his own business from true scratch, bought tools with his money that he earned from working at the factory, eventually bought all the materials neccesary and started his own tiny construction company if you could even call that, eventually after a long time he had started a real company, which made him a million dollars for a while. Eventually, the company went broke beleive it or not, and he went into debt, so he started from scratch again, but he started a bakery instead, eventually he had to sell it and he started another company with that money.  He made another million and the cycle continued for a bit until my father enters the picture, What does that mean to you? what do you think? did he deserve to make a million dollars? Did he deserve what happened to him?

&#x200B;

It doesent really matter because my father grew up with a wealthy parent for a while, My father asked about my grandpas company and learned from his mistake, my father eventually opened his own business with his own money, which me made by selling cars at a dealership, in fact he was the best salesman at the dealership at 25, at 27 he opened his own business, he worked hard to build it up and he invested the profits and lets just say he is retired at the ripe age of 45. 

&#x200B;

Now lets jump to my life, do i deserve to go to a good school? to get a better educatiuon than other people? Do i deserve to have an ""easy"" or ""simple"" life, never have to work harder than others or no way near as hard to make less? 

&#x200B;

The answer is who knows for sure. 

&#x200B;

But here is my take, my grandfather worked 3 lifetimes to give a better future to my dad and my dad worked smarter than 3 generation to give me the life that i have. I seized the oppurtunity to live that life that i have, i chose to live that life. I could have wasted it and spend it on drugs etc... 

&#x200B;

I used the resources that were given to be where i am at now,  

&#x200B;

Im targeting this part of your post ""  *When I had $0 I thought I was better than most people by far and my amount of money had nothing to do with how good of a person I am, being a good person only made it harder to make money. Now that I have $1000 I've only seen more and more proof. ""*

It seems like you think that the only way to make money is by screwing others. I say it really isnt, people some times put themselves in those position, not always of course, things like slaves exist even today, but i mean the larger majority. Look at the stock, you litterally hurt no one except yourself, and people live off of that thing. If you get lucky, which we all get in some way or another, its YOUR responsibility to seize it. There are people who literally had nothing except clothes and a blanket who ended up becoming rich or even escaping that life and just rising above it and getting a job and living in an appartment. All because they seized some form of oppurtunity or didnt wait for opportunity and just worked their way to what they wanted, some worked physically, othere mentally and alot of them, both.

What im about to say. Take the words luck in your example and priviliege in my example as the same thing. ok?

&#x200B;

Lets say this, I am 18 years old, my parents own their own business and i just graduated at a really good school, and they also own a few properties, my father and mother are university graduates. and i think you get the point, i am lucky/privileiged.

I go off to a good university, graduate with a relevant degree, and start working a steady job by 26, i make an average salary at the start and i work my way up the company and eventually start making really good money. I am lucky arent I?

&#x200B;

What does that make me?  A subhuman piece of shit, a piece of shit, a decent human being? Youre post just doesent make that much sensem IMO. 

&#x200B;

I guess at the end of the day the most important thing to know is that God loves you and anyone can be forgiven. No one is perfect and I personally think that we all live a life full of sin but at the end of the day if u accept christ as your saviour or atleast beleive, trust, love, and worship God you can be saved. Also I'd rather know that God loves me  but a priest hates me over anything. If God can love murderers and rapists he can love an LGBT person. At the end of the day we are all sinners and yet he still loves and forgives us 

As for your question  

I beleive there is a time and place for everything, I personally dont mind people talking about God in public or in campuses but I hate when they go to these places and talk about you will go to hell you sinner etc... in public places. If they are trying to bring people to their faith or church that's great, but if they are telling people they will suffer that's unnecessary."
