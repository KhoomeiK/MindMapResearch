Assistance,f6xfzqw,t1_f6xeu79,1573248811.0,"i'm not denying that, i'm more so responding to the incredulous and flippant attitude of the person to whom i'm replying. to cast doubt on an anorexic's (albeit a meth addicted one) need for lunch, in my experience, can be extremely shaming and can intensify the impulse to restrict food. asking for help to get food is hard; asking for help to get food as an anorexic is nearly impossible. i do understand being cynical, but i don't tolerate willful ignorance."
Assistance,f6x6fjo,t1_f6x5030,1573243029.0,"anorexics need to eat too, they just heavily restrict what and how much they eat. i'm anorexic myself and i can assure you anorexia would literally cease to exist if all anorexics simply didn't eat at all-- we'd all be fucking dead. just because you're entirely ignorant of how eating disorders work doesn't mean you can pass judgements on OP during her time of desperation."
