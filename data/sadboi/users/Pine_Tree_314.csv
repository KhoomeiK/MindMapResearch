I don't want to tick them off."" V.S. ""Oh, yeah, they're just joking around. We're having fun."" The lack of instant responses also gives me anxiety, but I also can use it as a thing to hide behind if the conversation gets too intense, or I'm starting to feel anxious as hell and need to take a breather from the topic.
