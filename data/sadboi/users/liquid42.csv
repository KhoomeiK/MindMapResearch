Anxiety,fqm321p,t1_fqlmzqt,1589470651.0,"Why are you anchored in overthinking in the first place? What are you trying to do? You're trying to be perfect in everything you do. Which isn't a bad thing but it can take a toll on your mental health. I feel like you would benefit a lot from meditating. Download the headspace app and try to meditate 5-10min and see how you feel. Clear your mind, and know that it's okay for thoughts to flood in but just don't pay attention to them. Notice your thoughts and let them go. 

I like this quote by Shunryu Suzuki 
""Leave your front door and your back door open.
Allow your thoughts to come and go.
Just don’t serve them tea."""
Anxiety,fqktb5i,t3_gjfsj7,1589435685.0,"I can tell you’re a perfectionist! You try to do the best in everything you do. Being a perfectionist has its ups and downs. For example trying to be perfect when you talk. The first step is acknowledging that and then coming to terms with the fact that it’s okay to be wrong. It’s okay to mess up your words there’s nothing wrong with saying the wrong thing. It’s not permanent you can always correct your self after. 

The best thing to do is to practice. Be a little chatty next time your out shopping or doing something. Ask the cashier how their day is going etc... just know that no ones perfect and it’s alright to mess up your words. You need to build confidence in speaking and the only way to do that is talking more often. 

You got this!"
Anxiety,fpyijw0,t3_gg967f,1589004505.0,"To simplify it your body evolved over thousand and thousands of years to be know whats dangerous. Long time ago coming across a wild predator would trigger your fight or flight response. This would increase your heart rate, dilate your pupils, tense up your muscles. Your body is getting ready to run or fight. 

Nowadays panic attacks are a result of your body’s fight or flight response being triggered when it shouldn’t. 

There is no danger around so why is your body acting this way?? There’s plenty of reason of why but you don’t need to focus on the why. For most, panic attacks will happen regardless but you need to learn how to manage the symptoms once they happen. You need a variety of tools at your disposal to help you during an attack. In time the severity will go down and down till it gets to a point where you can stop it before it happens. 

Meditation has helped me tremendously in the past so it’s something I suggest you look into!  Just know that it’s not forever and you’ll feel good again soon!"

EssentialTremor,fl1b8tc,t3_fkocec,1584725586.0,"> Keto significantly reduces the release of serotonin, this is the main reason it works.

Source? I don't believe this is true. Protein increases tryptophan that in turn creates serotonin. Tryptophan 
is mainly found in protein. Your gut is the biggest producer of serotinin in your whole body. 

Also to add on this the main reason keto works is not because of serotonin. [It's because of the increase of octanic acid](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/83621). It's shown to improve tremors. It's a medium chain triglyceride that is shown to convert enzymes into ketones at a rapid rate. Hence, your body going into ketosis.

It therefores makes sense that you feel more anxious/depressed the following days (your brain is still giving more attention to your amygdala, adapting itself to the increased demand it had during your episode)

This is not how it works. If you have a highly active amygdala then your more likely to have more emotional ups and downs. Crying releases different hormones that help you calm down and relive stress.
