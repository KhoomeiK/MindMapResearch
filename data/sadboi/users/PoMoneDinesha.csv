depression,fedhb8k,t3_eog11q,1579011512.0,"If you continue to overthink every single situation, you’re just making it harder on yourself than it already is. Understand that you cannot please everyone but at the same time you’re not a burden to those around you! I understand it’s tough,  and I’m assuming you feel as though you’re not good enough or worthy of your friends?! At this moment you may feel this way but in times like this I think it’s important to just meditate and think about your relationships with others. For one moment just close your eyes and try to really think about 2-3 good moments or memories with friends or even family, kind strangers, whoever  (everyone has moments when they atleast smile, so saying you have none means you need think harder).... it could be times you laughed, times you shared a meal, times you accomplished something...it could be anything big or small. Just remember, sure there will times we feel overwhelmed, isolated and low...but there will always, always be good moments/memories. Look forward to making more of those moments and cherish them :)"
depression,fbzkig8,t3_ef4960,1577249779.0,I feel the exact same way. This is usually the happiest time of the year however I just feel empty/numb inside. What’s really bothering me is that I can’t pin point whats causing this feeling and I really hope it passes. Merry Christmas y’all.
