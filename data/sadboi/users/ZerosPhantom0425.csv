relationships,fmz8v5v,t3_fxxsm6,1586510998.0,"Tbh there's providing support and providing good advice. I'm not gonna support you, I'm gonna judge and give better advice.
First: Really? An open marriage? The only people it ever works out for is sociopaths. She is not in love with this woman. She thinks she is because she finally has gotten to experience her sexuality further. She is confusing the idea of relief with love. She's glad she got to experience her sexuality further and glad she got to do it so she's obsessed with the idea that there is more out there for her. Sorry for the harshness, but I'm picturing myself in your position and I would be beyond pissed. If she can ""love"" two people at the same time, she doesn't love you enough. Ask her yourself, but don't accuse. She's confused and women don't like when you discredit their feelings obviously, so my advice is to ask her to think if she's actually in love or if she's confused about loving this women simply because she is experiencing her sexuality that she prevented herself from experiencing before. She doesn't love her lol. Be a man and help her understand what she's actually feeling. She needs you right now but she doesnt know it yet."
dating_advice,fmz7x2j,t3_fxx2ye,1586509921.0,"Lol I'm in the same position. I been talking to this girl I met on tinder for 2 months now but haven't met her because of the pandemic. If he sent you something, it isnt just because hes being nice. He is interested in you. It's a guy thing. It's perceived to be weird by some people because there are rules, but if he sent you something then hes obviously interested dating you. That sounds like something I'd do honestly. Most girls would think that it's weird to do what he did because they follow the rules too much. I say screw those rules. If two people sensor themselves from each other, then you're just two fake people trying to ""play it cool"" because you're scared of how the other person will react. I say SEND SOMETHING BACK! If you really want to. I'm sure he'd appreciate itðŸ™‚"

After reading through all of it, you're completely right about most of it except I dont think I'm perfect. I'm far from it. I've gone through so much shit with that last girl I mentioned. When I said ""games"" like it wasnt innocent. She was cold f*cling blooded. She did and said some nasty things to me. She was stringing me along for attention in the end just like you're saying this other girl is. Just confirms that it's all hopeless and I got the same result from what I thought was a step ahead. At least I can say I tried, but this pretty much confirms that this is the truth. Some people are truly meant to be alone. Guess I gotta live with it. Whatever."

I'm not saying I got it worse than you or anything, but I feel like I can relate at least on a certain level. I say take all your hardships as lessons and it really does build endurance. You just gotta break through that mental barrier that's telling you to give up. I did so by doing things I love doing and not taking anything for granted. You really get to know yourself by how many hardships you go through. Once you are happy with yourself, it will reflect and attract the ""genuine guys"" believe it or not.

I'm sorry but I hate this because it's the same way for women. A lot of women complain that all men are pigs, but they haven't met a nice guy because they're too busy looking for prince charming at a party or at the bars. A lot of women suck. A lot of men suck as well. Some just arent what we are looking for. It's all about the journey and not the destination.

I can see where that would be a joke, but on the other hand given that he doesn't have a car, he's a dropout, and works a job that's far away; he's probably said that to boost his own self esteem. It sounds like your just something on the side and that ain't cool. You need to be more direct and voice your demands and if he isn't cool with that, you might have to just get out of this relationship."

I'm pretty much in it for the long haul at this point. And I know her pretty well and she's a very nice girl. She just has some maturing to do.

I dont mean to sound like an older person thinking I'm better than you because I have more experience, but I will tell you this. High school is more of an expirementing phase in relationships. High school is a mixture of maturing and being more immature. Those are the two groups. I would stick with the mature group. People also like to think highly of themselves due to relationship status and how many friends they have. My point is that high schoolers on average care about what people think about them and will do anything to be more ""popular."" Around junior and senior year, that goes away, but don't worry about being with somebody too much. Or if you really like him, just make sure he's not a jerk before you do anything about it because young high schoolers are vulnerable. Hope that helps a little."

Also I felt like an idiot asking her to watch a movie with me because she turned me down to go to a birthday party, but she didnt tell me that. She just said she was busy. So whenever I feel like life is beating me to death, I go exercise until I'm worn out. I ran 2 miles out in the rain along with some stair climbs. I went back inside and her and one of my friends (hes gay so I'm not worried) were walking in the hallway. They were all dressed up so it was obvious they were going somewhere.

So all my friends left while I was in my room and she texted me and said, ""Hurry."" I came out and it was just her. I asked her why she didnt get me out of my room? She said ""Um you know what I dont really know why"" Then she started playing songs in the car that reference having a boyfriend. She played ""Hes got something special"" from Hannah Montana. She glanced at me and smiled while I was laughing about it. Then she started asking me who sings what. She was acting very flirty. Then at Buffalo Wild Wings her and I sat next to each other with all our friends. She kept nudging my feet and saying sorry. Then she kept putting her feet up on my chair. By the time I realized that she wanted to share the chair with me as a footrest, she was already mad. I nudged her foot and she looked pretty pissed the rest of the night. She kept one foot up on the chair as to show that she was mad, but she didn't wanna be a bitch. Then we rode back and I said ""Why are you mad at me?"" She said ""I'm not mad. You just don't have faith in me.""

We got back to the dorm and everyone said goodnight and went to bed. The next morning, I next night, I messaged and asked her if she wanted to go get a DVD player at walmart so we could watch movies. I JOKINGLY said that she had to drive though. She said, ""Ooooh shit"" and wouldnt say anything else. I knocked on her door and asked her if I could come in. She said ""no I'm watching Grays Anatomy! And you csnt get in anyways because the door is locked. I waited in her living room and said I would wait for her to come out. She said, ""go away."" Now she hasn't talked to me since that night. She keeps ignoring my messages or giving me passive aggressive responses over snap. So I thought she didnt wanna be around me anymore. I asked her if I should return the football tickets I bought. She said ""Omg for what day. I said, ""The 14th, but see you're mad."" She said, How many tickets did you get? Just two?"" I said yeah and she said ""okay lol"" I asked her again if she wanted me to return them and she said, ""What! No...do not.
So she still wont talk to me or hang out with me, but she doesnt want me to return the tickets. I don't know if this means I still have a chance with her or what. I've noticed she doesnt use her words and gets frustrated when her actions arent acknowledged. It's mostly my fault that it went down hill so fast because I didnt pick up on her hints quick enough, but its driving me crazy how she wont talk to me.

SO YEAH that's my story. Dont ever be stupid like me and too shy to flirt back."
Crushes,ezlxs4t,t1_ezjxj8g,1567983204.0,Enlighten me. I wrote about a whole book yesterday explaining my fucked up situation. People are actually willing to read that much. What's the story?!
Crushes,ezlxi4s,t3_d1e7hb,1567983076.0,"That's fucked bro. It doesnt seem like it, but there is someone for everybody. It takes some searching. What I've learned this past week is that shit can hit the fan within an instant. It all depends on what you're gonna fucking do about it. You gonna mope around and feel sorry and think ""what's the point"" or are you gonna set the fucking example that you are not someone to be messed with. In other words, think about how good things will be for you soon. No storm lasts forever"
Crushes,ezlgaek,t1_ezlf7mc,1567976328.0,Wait for one or two indicators. I waited until there were about 57 of them. Seriously I dont want anyone to make the same mistake as me.
Crushes,ezlcbuw,t3_d1cvdr,1567974910.0,"Ask him. As a guy who kind of did something similar like this, I messed up my chance because I decided to hide how I actually felt about her cause I'm incredibly shy. She flirted back and we would kinda be going out right now if I didnt ignore her. The reason that me and this girl didnt work out is because neither of us decided to tell eachother how we feel and we played a game too long and now I'm in the dog house. IF YOU DONT WANNA REGRET ANYTHING, TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL because I wish I would have done it."
dating_advice,ezl0b2o,t1_ezkyvby,1567969607.0,I've been vulnerable by asking her to hang out even though she either ignores me or says shes busy. I've been playing her game the whole time. She knows I really like her. I've asked her to watch a movie with me in my room. Does that not get the point accross enough. What else do I do. It's making me doubt that it's a game and she actually wants to be left alone. Do I just ask her if she wants me to back off or what?
dating_advice,ezkygbp,t1_ezkp356,1567968697.0,I've been messaging her non stop asking her to hang out. She keeps either ignoring the message or saying I'm busy even though shes in her room watching Netflix
dating_advice,ezkomqk,t1_ezko7nq,1567963910.0,Yes absolutely
dating_advice,ez30kfb,t1_ez2op3b,1567659962.0,Sir/ma'am you just blew my mind
dating_advice,ez3037v,t1_ez2ozvc,1567659880.0,I do lol but I dont care about that shit. I'm just spilling thoughts rapidly outs my head
dating_advice,ez2riqp,t1_ez2nztb,1567658081.0,"(Im 19) I agree with you, but I'm trying to play it smart. Idk what her and my friend are. Idk if they were a couple or they just talked. They only hung out a couple days before they fought and now they arent talking. Hes been trying to get her attention, but shes ignoring him and now is flirting with me again...I think. I dont think shes using me as a rebound because we've been playing this game longer than him and her have."
depression,eyvtq93,t1_eyvh6g8,1567511374.0,"I know. But as I am right now, I cant take that step. Is it wrong to ask my friend to tell her? I know it should be me, but I'm too weak to bring myself to do it. I dont have the mental capacity right now. I think it would help so I dont have to say it out loud for a 4th time and we can just talk about it while she already knows everything and then we can talk solutions right away."
depression,eyvth1c,t1_eyvk4kh,1567511103.0,"Thank you. But something I failed to mention is that my friends are my everything. Without them I have nothing else to look forward to. Everyone back home is moving on with their lives. I can't just go backwards and I especially cant leave my friends because then I'll just be lonely and it makes things worse. It's okay I dont expect you to find a solution for me. I gotta figure it out on my own, but I need to vent"
heartbreak,eyvrybq,t1_eyvrli7,1567509409.0,"Thank you. The only answer is to tell her. It's been going through my head, and you're right. I'm hurting myself by doing this. I have one last question though. How do I tell her that I'm depressed because of her? She might get freaked out because obviously it's a really big deal and again I would be complicating things for her. What if her way of helping me is avoiding me? I cant lose her as a friend because of this. Shes one of my best friends and without the friends I have here, I am nothing. I had nothing but loneliness back at home. I have a family and all, but they all have better things to focus on and special people in their lives that they need to spend their time with. My brother got divorced a year ago and hes still dealing with her bullshit. You'd think that I could just talk to him about this, but I don't think he will ever love again. He has his kids to focus on. I dont have that. I dont have anything else to pour my time and my heart into"
heartbreak,eyvrkm4,t1_eyvr3j7,1567508964.0,"I want nothing more to take this as a learning experience, but I dont know if I can ever try to care about someone this much if I run the risk of doing it all over again. Plus I still need time and I dont have it with all the training I have to do. I cant perform my job like this. If I do what seems to be necessary, I have to leave my best friends because of some girl that I fell in love with. How messed up is that?"
heartbreak,eyvrcvw,t1_eyvr3j7,1567508699.0,"That's accurate, how can I simply move on from her. I wish it were that simple, but it's not. It's not like ripping off a bandaid. It's like taking bullets out of your chest. I cant do it"
depression,eyvgnfa,t1_eyvg406,1567493492.0,"I know it's ridiculous to get hung up on this one girl, but shes completely different than any other girl that I've ever met. And on top of that we are close. Its complicated but idk about getting discharged. At this point it's more about my health than anything else. If I cant find a purpose for my life, I'm not gonna give up. I'll survive even if it means I'm not happy cuz I care too much about the people that care about me. Ita a decision that I'm gonna need to make soon"
depression,eyvfng1,t1_eyvetw7,1567492176.0,"I appreciate the fuck out of your honesty cuz it's all probably true. I guess I dont really have much else to say. I dont really know what's ahead, but thanks for giving me a truthful answer even though it's not the answer I wanted to hear."
depression,eyvdhwc,t1_eyvdepy,1567489514.0,"Thank you, but if I avoid them, they'll start to suspect something. Its not that simple"
dating_advice,eypaki2,t3_cxwhgn,1567294652.0,I envy you. I wish my case were that simple. My situation is just a big mess with the girl I have a thing for
Crushes,eyney8u,t1_eyner6x,1567245226.0,"Sorry if that came off as rude haha. You're right though I should have been more clear on that.

I really appreciate your help. I'm gonna do one of those things tomorrow. We might go to the zoo with some friends tomorrow, but if we dont then I'll just try to find sometime to be alone with her. I like your idea of asking her to go eat, but I think playing a video game might break the ice smoother. Then once it's more comfortable I'll take your idea. That is if she is actually into me"
Crushes,eyneaki,t1_eyne2fj,1567244187.0,"I might just consider your idea. And by doing something stupid, I meant doing something unhealthy that wouldnt hurt anybody but myself. I would never hurt anyone just wanna make that clear.
  
Do you think it would be weird if I asked her to come accross the hall to play a video game? She was having fun with it yesterday. Idk"
Crushes,eyne1qk,t1_eyndwg7,1567243791.0,"Thank you. That's what I've been thinking, but all I can really think is why. Shes more mature than I am. Shes really smart and yet theres a chance that she likes me. I guess I feel like it doesnt seem real because no other girl has been this nice to me ever."
dating_advice,eyn905s,t3_cxt5ko,1567236979.0,"Btw these 5 months dont seem like it could be that long, but in military training, you are with each other about 12 hrs each day, so It felt like a whole year because I saw her literally every single day"
dating_advice,eyfrfcy,t1_eyfrbhz,1567053647.0,I've actually been thinking about watching it. I'll check it out thanks!

You make a very valid point. The thing I hate about it is that I feel like it's something I need to think about and I hate thinking about it cuz only negative things flow through my head. That's why I cant muster up the courage to ask her"
dating_advice,eyfpcqj,t1_eyfoc2e,1567052593.0,"Lmao I dont get to sit down. I'm security forces, so my training has been 50% getting in trouble if I sit downðŸ˜‚. I appreciate the advice, but what if she says no? Then itll be akward between us and shes the only one here that makes me feel happy. Sounds corny ikr"
