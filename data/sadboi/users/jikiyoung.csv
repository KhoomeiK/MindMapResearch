ptsd,fn2qoo9,t1_fn1yzbv,1586599428.0,"By being a male you're automatically more privileged than any female, whether you're autistic or a sexual assault victim, you're still more privileged because of you biology. You're less likely to be sexually assaulted because your male, 1 in every 71 men will be assaulted while females is 1 in every 5. Yes, men have less support for sexual assault, but that doesnt make you less privileged than a female. Female with autism also suffer more neglect for their disability than males, and commonly go undiagnosed because the basis for diagnosing autism is based off of male studies, even though the female brain is entirely different. Privileged isnt just who goes through what worse, it's based off of a hierarchy of system and societal/cultural approach. I mean no disrespect, but I disagree with you whole heartedly.

I was easily overpowered and attacked by my dads yellow labrador, even though I used to play with him as a puppy. My moms Boston Terrier is a shit brick house and is really skiddish around kids, but because of her size it's easy to restrain her when she starts getting too rough or her demeanor changes. Shiba Inus are also a more aggressive breed because they were bred for hunting, but because they dont have the usual muscle mass of a pitbull they arent seen as dangerous. I work with a lot of dogs, and although it's hard to restrain pitbulls because if they're strength, they're generally sweet breeds."
aww,ercd1ra,t3_c195np,1560708912.0,"I work at an animal shelter, this is more common than you think! A lot of people wont adopt animals that look afraid, sad, or aggressive, but I'm sure you would look the same if you were locked in a cage for 20 hours of your day surrounded by unknown smells of other animals. There was this pitbull named Triscuit who had scars all over her face and legs that looked like bite marks. She had fear in her eyes while she was in the cage, and I was unsure about walking her. If she had been used as a fight dog, there was no way I could take on this 110lb pit bull if she took off. But I had decided to take the chance anyways. Once I got her out of the cage, she was absolutely wonderful! Her tail wagged, her eyes lit up with happiness, and was the sweetest girl ever!!! I walked her for extra long and gave her playtime, and in that moment, a family saw me walking her. After I brought her back in and into her cage, the family that saw me approached me. ""Where was that dog you were just walking?"" and excitement filled me. This dog had been here for 2 months without any adoption, and in fact had the infamous pit bull skin irritation. I brought them to Triscut, looking pitiful, scarred, and scared in her cage, I reassured them. They stated that they wanted to meet with her, and I had a Vet Tech come and take them to go get friendly. I continue walking animals until my shift ends around 4. I come out to my car, and there I see Triscut playing with the family's other dog. She ran up to the fence and watched me get in my car. I watched them for a minute, and then yelled out to the family, asking them if they were going to adopt her. They said yes! I felt so happy that this dog was going to be adopted and given a lovely home. This is one of the many cases of animals at the shelter that experience this. They're totally different outside of the cage, and if you ever have an interest in an animal but are unsure about their attitude and demeanor, ask the staff to see them outside of the cage. It will change in an instant :-)"
