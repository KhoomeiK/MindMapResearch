She had a daily television show so people didn´t accuse her of having surgery, but a lot of people said she was less relatable. She actually did an episode related to it where a woman said that she used to feel like she could hang out with Oprah and that they could eat doughnuts and drink coffee, but now she felt like she would have to have special diet food for her. Someone else said they felt that Hollywood had pressured her into losing weight. Which is sad and shitty but I get it, you see someone who is similar to you and you can picture that you could be friends if they weren´t famous and then they change and it feels like a betrayal. 

We see post on this sub fairly often of friends and family not being supportive or reacting badly when someone gets healthier. It's sad and we should do better, but emotions are complicated, and someone else´s weight loss can make you have to deal with your own food issues.

I then worked in a school in Mexico that was registered as a Spanish school, most of the teachers were native Spanish speakers and the expectation was if you were foreign you should have at least intermediate Spanish. Except the school hired many foreign teachers who had poor Spanish skills and this made meetings and other planning activities a nightmare. I would have to prepare an English and a Spanish presentation if I was trying to explain something to my colleges.

I have friends who used Search associates, they are both reputable, but it seems that Search associates do a better job of trying to match you with schools.

Internationalteachers,fo350ix,t3_g5gdr3,1587480666.0,"Math teachers are always going to have a bit easier time getting hired than other teachers because there is high demand for good math teachers. MYP means grades 6-10 and DP is just 11th and 12th grade. The MYP tends to have less oversight from the IB which could make for a more enjoyable teaching experience. With DP you have the Internal assessments, and exams which then reflect heavily on your success as a teacher and that can be stressful for some people. Having experience with more complicated math will always be a plus in the application process, but lacking experience with higher maths won´t eliminate you from most schools.

witchcraft,fjtauyb,t3_fevwip,1583605975.0,"Witchcraft is deeply personal, and yeah sometimes I think in the age od the internet you can feel like you aren´t doing enough to be a ""true"" witch. Some people really love the ritual and that makes them feel more connected to the craft others are more practical in their magic. Basically do what feels right to you and try to have your social media reflect  the more educational side of things instead of the aesthetic side. For example, I love tarot so I have a lot of accounts dedicated to the description of cards but I don´t follow accounts that just have beautiful alters or spreads."

My GF speaks Spanish, but she didn´t teach me Spanish I took a lot of classes and was able to practice speaking with her and her family which helped to reinforce what I was learning and keep me motivated. Now that my level is decent we speak in Spanish pretty regularly but I did most of the work outside of our relationship."
AskReddit,fja8its,t3_fcbntx,1583168548.0,"The only time I was able to do this is when I was teaching I had this little gold pen on a necklace like Joan from MadMen. I used it every day and replaced the ink in the pen probably 4 or 5 times before I lost the pen in a move. I have a few other pens I have used all the ink in, but I use them for my bullet journal so they live in a mesh bag, that I use a few times a week. So basically have special pens that have a designated location so you notice if it is missing."
actuallesbians,fja4nbe,t3_fc6qs1,1583166296.0,"My GF and I are super lucky that our immediate families are very supportive, but last weekend we went to a wedding with her extended family and things got pretty awkward one of her cousins asked us a bunch of "" explain to me what it is like to be queer questions"" then followed it up with the statement "" i don´t like bisexuals"" and I was like oh well I guess you don´t like me then, that´s cool I´m not really fond of bigots. Then her uncle introduced me to a group of people as my girlfriend's roommate, and then I corrected him and said no I am her partner.  To which he said well that's the same thing right har har har. So we basically cut a lot of people from our wedding invite list."
antiMLM,fj3wy0o,t3_fbcchw,1582995100.0,"I had a Mary Kay person come to our sorority meeting when I was in college, and it was pretty laid back they let us try the new skin care line which I actually liked because it didn't have fragrance and so I filled out a form and assumed they would bring it to the next meeting. I got a call a couple days later asking me to come pick up the products at a very nice house. Then some woman in her 50s I had never seen before tried to pressure me into buying the start up kit and talked about how much money she made with Mary Kay. I told her I already had 2 jobs and a full schedule of classes so I wouldn't be joining her team. She wouldnt let it go so I just left without the product I did want to buy."
facepalm,fiqzwo6,t1_fiqw3ib,1582654604.0,My ex-boyfriend's sister does this shit all the time. I still follow her on Instagram. She is white and has 2 white bio daughters but fostered a black girl for a little over a year. She would always say that her kids/ foster kids were making these deep comments about race ( the oldest are 5 and 6 respectively). Ok like maybe a kid would acknowledge that they are a different color than their foster family and that might be difficult in some ways. But making comments about other people's perceptions of their family is something that a 5 and 6-year-old would not be able to articulate. I do think she is a good mom and cares for them deeply but she also uses them as a way to tell people about the racism they face sometimes when she could just tell that story in her own voice.

MexicoCity,fiam1kv,t1_fiaknrs,1582303830.0,"It seems to me like your argument was that the food wasn't traditional and was too hipstery for it to be considered a ""real"" Mexican  neighborhood, and I was arguing that there are plenty of restaurants that are authentic and delicious and that is enough reason to go to roma or condesa. Other neighborhoods have their own charm attractions and food as well, and I am not saying that those neighborhoods are less good. As far as shops go I didn't mention  anything about that."
MexicoCity,fiajhop,t1_fiai6zs,1582302322.0,Thats not true at all there are plenty of  more upscale tractional restaurants a long with the more trendy places. There are also tons of little places that have a great traditional Mexican lunch for 80 pesos.These places exist because even tough there is a lot of tourist activity here it is still a neighborhood were Mexicans work and live.

Teachers,fi3u31f,t3_f67hpy,1582127670.0,"Part of the problem with the only working contract is that in university you are basically taught that to be a good teacher you should always be doing extra things. During my student teaching, I was working 60-70 hours a week and when I asked my professor if that was normal he said: ""well once you have everything prepared it will be fewer hours because you will just revise what you have, but teaching isn´t a 40 hrs a week job"". I would come in at 7 and leave at 5 for 4 years ( my contract was 830-345)  and I thought I was just being a good teacher.  We should be teaching new teachers to just work their contract hours and that the district should be providing them with the bulk of their curriculum."

If not then I would check facebook marketplace  to get a bike."
Spanish,fhxigup,t3_f5a0s8,1581955129.0,"A lot of people say you shouldn´t translate in your head, but it was a key part of me learning and speaking Spanish when you have a higher level you can use context to figure out meaning and then you don´t really have to translate anymore, but I think it is important in the early stages. I think its good if you are watching something you can pause to maybe write a word or phrase you have heard a couple of times and then look it up after and add it to your Anki deck. So"
Spanish,fhstkkx,t3_f4icg5,1581865267.0,"That's a great progress for a few weeks, I think a lot of times people don´t want to speak until they feel more confident but you won´t feel more confident until you practice speaking. It looks like being immersed is a great way to do that. Congrats, and good luck on the rest of your journey."
