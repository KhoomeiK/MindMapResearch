I remember when he was Obama's VP, and listening to him now it's a black and white difference. He speaks slower, he goes on strange tangents, he loses his train of thought easier and it's harder for him to get back on track. I've known enough people who have gotten dementia to know what the early parts look like. If he really believes he can keep it together enough to beat Donald Trump, then I'll support him 100%. I absolutely will vote against Trump no matter who. But real talk I think the morally right choice would be to concede the race to Bernie Sanders now on the basis of his cognitive decline.
