It's very interesting to have probably a whole year in a psych ward/rehab setting, and STILL have the closest to you think you're ""crazy"" or you haven't ""sought enough help""...........



......k. Why would i fake this, if i have nothing left? He dropped me off at a hotel because it was cutting myself(he helped look for his multi-tool to get the x-acto knife sheath off it, and it didnt work), or get drunk and be alone in the bedroom. We both knew getting drunk in the bedroom wasn't great, so i said I'll pay for a hotel to get drunk alone (in before COVID hatred, I wore a mask, the hotel is a glass-only interaction, like a bank) if he drives me there. He bought my room with him as an incedental (he cut up my ID).

Ugh this won't go anywhere, and if it does it'll be downvoted, and god i hate myself."

Lol that's what I'd say in my head. If it came down to it, I'd probably just resign out of sheer shame and embarrassment (I have paranoid tendencies, so don't think that's 'normal' lol) or I'd make a big deal about it. It seems the only time taking the middle ground works, is if they're on the same ground"

I will gladly list all of the resources I've experienced. Please stop saying that to people. It's demeaning."
occult,fosr7xf,t1_fospoze,1588036378.0,"I am not stupid. I know alcohol and escapism isn't good for mental illness, but neither is suffering around someone contributing to guilt when none should be there. Im only getting blackout as a last resort

We are in a pandemic. Nobody is accepting new patients. I was on state-funded insurance (medicaid), got on disability because i couldnt work, was kicked off medicaid and put on medicare (federal insurance). I no longer have access to the care i needed (therapists, substance abuse disorder counselors).

Really tired of the same answer over and over again, like yours. I know it's exhausting to deal with these emotions because I'm the one that experiences them. If i could find my own place, i would. Why expose someone to this? It sounds like you're almost guilting me. 

I have exhausted every resource i can think of. If you need a list, let me know. Otherwise id appreciate it if you focused on sympathizing instead of trying to ""find a solution"""

occult,fosocnf,t3_g9cyie,1588034704.0,"As said in past comments and posts, i live with crippling illnesses, mostly emotional and subsequently substance abuse. The past couple of weeks I've been very in-tune with the seasonal change, thus making loaves of bread for a lot of people in our apartment building, cleaning and organizing many areas etc...

I am feeling deeply connected to facets of my being that are happy, content, and tired of previous abuse i let slide in colder months... And colder lives. Realizing my roommate (we can't NOT rent together because we need each other in a capitalistic way) and I are soooo different. He shames me for having intense emotions, even when I'm not directing it at him. 

I dunno why I'm making this post. Just really in awe of the message the post-it gave me, in a hotel room alone, to get blackout drunk to escape the injustice of the world, and him.

Literally last night i found and donated to Mind Freedom International (in the amount I would've spent on alcohol that night). 

Today, I tried sharing this with my ex/roommate and it turned into this crap. Him denying or even acknowledging things I thoughtfully brought up (without accusations), me telling him how I've shown sympathy for him in the past, shared a wikihow article on sympathy....

Anyway, i guess i am needing other validation. Sympathy. Connection. I felt this post-it note from years ago, reminded me i don't have to stumble over and second-guess myself when he asks shitty things like, ""oh, you're hypervigilant because of childhood abuse? What did your mom do to you again?"" When I've given countless stories of my mom screaming, throwing things, suicide threats, blackouts, specific weird instances of abuse....... And he's known me for 4 or 5 years?

Ugghhhhhhhh 


Please, Athena, my shaman ancestors, other people with open minds, anyone with empathy and sympathy... Please hear me. I also thank you for hearing me. I love and respect you."
CPTSD,fosatyv,t3_g96v8s,1588027126.0,"My roommate/ex has asked me if I was * really * assaulted by my other ex. Also today i was telling him in I-statements about my paranoia and possible schizoaffective symptoms, how I'm easily frightened because of hypervigilance... He gets mad at me when I involuntarily gasp from a loud noise. I tried explaining my continual trauma in childhood made me very jumpy, and he asked, ""oh how did your mom abuse you? Yell?""... We've known eachother for 5 years and he is actively trying to question the validity of my illnesses by making sure the abuse I suffered was ""enough to warrant that"". God, I'm so angry. Actually going to a hotel to blackout drink because I can't fucking deal with his shit today. Oh, and I found out yesterday an old friend passed, he was only 28. He just kept scrolling on his phone and made a joke about covid. What a twat"
