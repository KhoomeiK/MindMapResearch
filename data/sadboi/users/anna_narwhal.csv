bipolar2,fmex1tq,t1_fmbjca4,1586015381.0,It bothers me when it wakes me up at night and I'm just stuck laying there with a song on repeat in my head. I guess I should just accept it.
bipolar2,fmaygy7,t3_ftz1m9,1585912726.0,"I always have a song stuck in my head. I will randomly wake up in the night with a song going in my head, and throughout the day I notice it playing in my head a lot. I take lamotrigine and sertraline, but this has been a problem I've had for as long as I can remember, even before being on any meds."

bipolar2,fj8jc5w,t3_fbya1v,1583114738.0,"This totally happens to me. Like I will start to feel like my bra is squeezing me or my pants, or a seatbelt. Like I don't want anything touching me."

Anxiety,fgefk67,t3_exx6jc,1580698401.0,"Yep. I struggle with movie theaters for this reason. My husband loves the ""XD"" theater where everything is louder, but I really have trouble with anxiety sitting through that. When I'm feeling super anxious I also find myself turning down the radio while driving or snapping at others speaking to me or shutting them out."

bipolar2,fgbumd1,t3_exkqp9,1580666250.0,I do. I really struggle with going to sleep because of it sometimes.
AmItheAsshole,fef97vi,t3_eoojak,1579051165.0,NTA obviously... I don't see how this could possibly be argued any other way.
atheism,fd0ez5u,t1_fd005jb,1578117855.0,"Evolution and the big bang theory is not taught in every school in the world.

Theories are taught as theories with multiple different theories being presented together, not with one specific theory being taught as fact."
bipolar2,fciec3b,t3_eh9vmu,1577661269.0,"Hearing from you and everyone else here is really interesting to me. I have bipolar 2, but I don't have ADD or ADHD.

When I want to learn something new I tend to get a little intense reading and learning about whatever it is before I try it. I end up learning a lot and wanting to do whatever it is at an advanced level and struggle with starting slow and easy.

But it isn't necessarily a lack of patience. I am a patient person and can handle repetition or things that many people find boring. I just want to challenge myself and forget the importance of starting at the beginning and building on that foundation."
insomnia,fbwxuzl,t3_eetd26,1577162415.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. My mom killed herself 6 years ago and I struggled very much with mental health issues and insomnia. I wish you did not have to experience the pain you are going through. It's a pain that never heals, but it does get better with time. I found therapy and sleep hypnosis helped me the most. Also just talking to others and being open about the pain and struggles. I also have to keep a strict schedule to keep my insomnia away. I'm not terrific at keeping a strict schedule, but I do try. I hope you can find peace and sleep."
mentalhealth,fb9i4f5,t3_ec4nq0,1576639180.0,"I completely agree. I've always enjoyed walking at night, but discovered a couple years ago that night stillness combined with snow is my absolute favorite üñ§"
insomnia,fb9hpac,t3_ebyjnh,1576638855.0,"I've had insomnia for over 10 years and melatonin never works for me. I'm glad it worked out for you. The tricky thing is figuring out what causes each individual's case of insomnia to find the best solution.

I had a doctor prescribe me amitriptyline as a sleep aid, but it didn't help me sleep and I would just be drowsy all day.

I tried free sleep hypnosis videos on YouTube, per my therapist, and that was helpful. I also have to stick to a sleep schedule or else I will fall back into the insomnia pattern. I eventually found my chronic insomnia to be a symptom of mental health disorders and treating those disorders was the only way to calm the severity of the insomnia episodes."

CrossStitch,eojs4nm,t3_bs70zp,1558642121.0,"I just started last year. I had been trying to find a hobby and nothing really seemed to stick other than reading books, which I've loved since I was a kid. I saw a book one day - Improper Cross-Stitch by Haley Pierson-Cox - and I thought it looked fun and easy enough to try. Once I started I was hooked. 

I love how relaxing it is. I also like that I can talk to my husband while doing it. I love that I can pick a pattern and follow it, since I'm not talented at creating things myself. I also love the feel of the thread. It's nice to do something with my hands."
