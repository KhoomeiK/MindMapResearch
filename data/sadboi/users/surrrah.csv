But my fp was up like all day so they went to bed at a weird time and wanted me to call and wake them up so we could play video games.

I don’t wanna be annoying. I don’t want them to be mad for waking them up. They probably don’t even wanna talk to me. They just feel bad for me. They definitely hate me. Fuck I should just call I’m being stupid. He literally told me to. Fuck now is it too late to call? I should’ve just called earlier.. etc’. 

Then texted another friend saying something like, I hate being in my head sometimes. And they responded with yeah don’t we all and like I know they are trying to be nice and mean well but they just don’t know. I don’t know why I ever try to talk to people (which I hardly do) cause I just get the impression they think I’m insane but are trying to relate to make me feel better, but it only makes it worse.
