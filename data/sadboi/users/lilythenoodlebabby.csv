I struggled through undergrad because I was so afraid of failing that I'd often be paralyzed with fear of failure. It was a vicious cycle of me randomly reinforcing my fears (self-preservation kicked in sometimes and I would excel, other times I would procrastinate too long and miss deadlines). I think what made me successful in grad school was knowing that I was in the right place for me career-wise. I had the opportunity to get a sneak peek of my desired career and it felt really right. I was also really motivated because it gave me a sense of purpose and drive. I had a clear vision of where I was going and I used that to then think about how each class was helping me get there.

I've also learned that a lot of times, my thoughts are interesting and an asset to others. I started sharing my insights and was really encouraged when my professors and peers listened, respected, and reinforced my additions."

We don't know how pervasive these thoughts are, how upsetting they are for you, how frequently they occur.

askatherapist,fnefiyv,t3_g18wzv,1586888458.0,"I mean, this is definitely the way some people conceptualize addiction. And how some people attempt to address it. It seems helpful in addressing the immediate behavior but if that's the only way you treat it, it's pretty likely that the person struggling with addiction will relapse when the unpleasant stimuli stops occurring and loses strength. Addiction isn't primarily about ""ooh, this feels good,"" I mean it is, but it really isn't. It's more about things generally feeling very unpleasant and/or intense and the object of addiction helping the person to cope with those feelings/thoughts/etc (although not in an ideal, healthy way). If we can address the thoughts and feelings under the addiction, we're more likely to have better, longer-term success.

Think of the behavioral approach like a band-aid on a compound fracture. It might (maybe, maybe) help with some of the bleeding but that person's still suffering immense pain.

The more effective treatment is behavioral, then insight-driven. Someone who's actively engaging in their addiction won't be able to engage deep emotional therapy and it's incredibly important to build effective, safe coping skills as you get ready to look at what's under the surface."

AmItheAsshole,fn0peq9,t3_fydqux,1586546233.0,"NAH. You're valid in thinking it's gross and needing space. But...

You say that it's definitely not depression... But answering sad/depressing/[insert appropriate word here] news with optimism doesn't mean that she's not depressed in her inner world. As humans, most of us get to choose how much others see, even subconsciously. It's entirely possible, especially right now, that she is incredibly depressed but some piece of her has decided that the way she can maintain a sense of control and normalcy is by maintaining that positivity. Sit down and connect with her. How is she feeling? There's a lot of stuff going on in the world, COVID is affecting people in all kinds of ways. What has changed for her? How does she feel about those changes? What has she lost or what is she missing out on that was maybe a given before?

Now is the time to lean into each other, not disconnect by living in a different building. You need each other. What does she need from you to feel loved and vice versa?

Everything about it. How can anyone confidently say that they wouldn't feel sexual attraction to absolutely any person of a gender? Like, as much as 50% of the entire population of the world is totally unattractive to you because they don't fit inside this one box? Can't comprehend.

My sexuality is basically demisexual opportunist. If I happen to develop the right kind of relationship that could produce sexual feelings my brain and body don't seem to care about gender at all.

Just pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. Try not to worry too much about labeling yourself. If you eventually find that something feels right, then it applies to you. Even if you don't find a name for how you experience attraction, know that other people can relate."

TalkTherapy,fbeoshc,t3_ecxrox,1576790454.0,"It sounds like you'd really like them to acknowledge that it's tough to hear some of your stuff. I wonder if them verbalizing that it's difficult would be validating or if you would worry about them more. I'm guessing it would depend on what all they said and how. As a therapist in training, some of my best supervision notes have been about allowing my clients to see that what they say does affect me and that I'm still there, in fact the effect means that I understand them better and feel more motivated to help them."

Dissociation,fbbrad6,t3_ecinif,1576706377.0,"It's like experiencing life through a film/sheer curtain/screen. Like you're near life, but not in it. Or sometimes, it's static. Like, I physically feel sensations that remind me of the sounds and appearance of static on an old TV. I feel... buzzy and disconnected. Overstimulated is probably the technical term. Other times it's constantly finding myself physically in a place where I clearly had a plan and method, but asking myself what they were. I ask myself ""Where am I?"" And ""What was I doing?"" So often. Or being in the middle of a social situation and having the sense that I'm continually dragging myself back into focus so I can be present and engaged. It's exhausting.

I've also experienced some form of dp/dr for as long as I can remember. I have memories of laying down at nap time (3 yo?) and being certain that my entire life so far was just someone else's dream and they'd wake up any moment."
Dissociation,fbbq1pd,t1_fbbowoo,1576705622.0,"In a social situation, I might lightly sway, tap a foot, crack my neck, take a full deep breath. Anything to feel a physical connection to my body. I've gotten to the point where I can also just tell my SO, ""I'm having a hard time being in my body right now, but I'm really trying to stay here,"" because it helps them be aware and I think they do little things to help me stay present. I also tend to repeat phrases in my mind. Stuff like, ""I'm right here,"" or ""I'm still here."" I don't know if any of it actually helps but it gives me something to do while I get through it."

TalkTherapy,fb9mlsb,t1_fb92rnk,1576642764.0,"I work from an existential framework! I would love to work with an existential therapist. When I went looking I paid very close attention to the key words people used to help clue in me to how they might do therapy and found someone I think might've been a good fit. Of course, that person was full so I settled. Now that I'm done with my internship and my hours are much more open, I think I could probably find someone who's a better fit that works within my schedule."
askatherapist,fb9dphz,t1_fb9ckv2,1576635913.0,"Sorry, I didn't explicitly say it and I should've. I think they would have the obligation to report. That said, I don't know how the social workers ethics work, but from what I've picked up from others I've been under the impression that they're ethically stricter than the counselors'. I think it would be the new therapists ethical obligation to report the social worker because it could mean a matter of protecting safety (psychological and otherwise)."
TalkTherapy,fb9cxyt,t1_fb9ceal,1576635363.0,I had a couple of great Ts earlier in my education. They were really who inspired me to go after it for myself. The knowledge that they're out there is what's both frustrating and encouraging for me right now. I really wish my internship supervisor could be my counselor but we already have some overlapping roles that would mean a conflict of interest. I appreciate your insights and I'll keep searching üòä
Fosterparents,fb9cejf,t3_ebvwyt,1576634959.0,This makes me sick. I'd love to help create supportive programming for young people aging out. The community needs to care more about our kids.
askatherapist,fb9c7fw,t1_fb8vu40,1576634815.0,"I mean, take into account the power dynamic. That's the ethical dilemma here. The social worker was in a position that they had power over OP, whether that's still true or not. Social worker seems like they should have an ethical obligation to refrain from dating patients."
TalkTherapy,fb9by5f,t1_fb9be8n,1576634626.0,"That makes total sense. I know that what's going on for me requires so much more than quick and easy, so I think a lot of what my t is trying to do feels invalidating and dismissive. Like I said a few things in the intake and she did a lot of talking and instructing from there. It's so different than how I prefer to give therapy because from my perspective, successful therapy isn't about having the ""right"" suggestions or interventions but about helping people feel heard, gaining perspective, and building their own insight. That just... Isn't there with her."
TalkTherapy,fb91yxe,t1_fb91hxn,1576627328.0,"I conceptualize myself as not really having any trauma history. But what you've said otherwise fits really well. I think someone who works from a family systems or person-centered perspective would be a much better match for me than CBT but they're hard to come by in my area, and it's harder to come by people I don't know/work with who fit the bill. Thought-stopping seems so invalidating to me and I can't ever imagine asking one of my clients to do it, especially when one of my automatic thoughts is that I don't have anything important/worthwhile to say. Like, how is ""stop it!"" a good and appropriate response to that???"
menstrualcups,fb80abk,t3_ebvhgd,1576603330.0,"I basically always use toilet paper to help me grip my cup. Sometimes things just get a bit too slippery up there and it helps! Also, take a deep breath. Step away if you need to. Your cup is not going to get stuck, there's a learning process, and it WILL come out. I know it gets scary, especially when it's new. I've been using cups for three years and I can't tell you how many times I freaked myself out in the beginning. Reach up with your toilet paper until you have a grip on the cup and give it a gentle twist and pull, see if it moves down at all. Squeezing the cup should also help break the suction."
TalkTherapy,fakc92q,t3_e9j2jv,1576164650.0,"So maybe there were things you could have done to make sure you were fully informed, but it's also the therapist and whoever processes your payment's responsibility to communicate with you and make sure you know how much the service costs. Where else can people charge you money without making sure you know what you're paying? I get why this is upsetting for you. I would be frustrated and probably feel a little taken advantage of in the same situation. I'm sure nobody intentionally kept you out of the loop, but it did happen. I would make sure they know because it might help prevent the same confusion from happening to another client.

Editing to add: in the office where I've been counseling, part of our paperwork is a form with the agreed upon fee for counseling written on it. My clients and I or office staff have to sign it so everyone is informed. Clients are paying different amounts based on insurance coverage, sliding scale fees, whether they're working with an intern, etc. so it's extra important to have that kind of documentation. Did you sign anything similar?"
askatherapist,faikk5p,t3_e9f75k,1576110090.0,"Therapist here: I'm going to speak explicitly for myself and not as an authority. I totally get where you're coming from. I hate most pet names and a lot of mushy relationship stuff. I'm of the opinion that that's okay/""normal""/acceptable as long as it's not an issue in the relationship. It sounds like it's difficult for your SO to understand and accept. Have you talked with them about how you feel when they use that language/expect you to do the same? This seems like something a reasonable person would accept and adapt to if their partner felt the way you do. 

I'd also ask myself what's uncomfortable about those words? Does it feel degrading in some way, juvenile, condescending, etc. For me, most pet names sound impersonal and meaningless. When I hear someone use them to refer to me, I feel insignificant/forgettable. Understanding that about myself has made that part much easier to accept."
menstrualcups,fafamjx,t3_e8q9y3,1576018168.0,"I've been using the cup since I graduated undergrad and it's been such a lifesaver for more. I feel like my cramps aren't anywhere near as bad as they used to be and I get so upset if I go somewhere without it and start my cycle. I'm to the point that more often than not, if that happens, I run to the nearest Target and get one of the non-diva cup brands they offer rather than buying a box of tampons."
menstrualcups,f8ugte7,t1_f8tw1sq,1574828997.0,"My doctor recently requested an ultrasound because something felt off in the normal manual exam, turns out my uterus is more to the left than average. I've always had lots of clots so now I'm wondering if I have fibroids."
askatherapist,f8qmfq2,t3_e1gr18,1574720048.0,"As a therapist and client, I can't imagine being so forceful about suggesting medication and I can't imagine how I would feel if my therapist was that way with me. I always ask clients if they have any interest in medication to help treat their symptoms but I also always reassure them that I'm asking because I could help consult with a prescribing doctor, not because I think it's necessary for the client.  How is this therapist for you otherwise? Do you feel comfortable with them?

Lots of clients experience passive/intrusive suicidal ideation. It's something I'm attentive to, but I also don't assume they're on the brink of completing suicide. A more appropriate response is to ask some questions about what else is going on when the client notices those thoughts... I see why you had that reaction to your therapist suggesting medication, it sounds like they were trying to ""fix"" the symptoms rather than listen to you and what's really going on."
psychotherapy,f7ialnl,t1_f7i2dr9,1573756088.0,"Seconding this. My supervisor for my internship site knows my mom (we all work for the same non-profit) and it can feel tricky when my countertransference is connected to mom stuff. A lot of times I worry about how things I say might affect my supervisor's relationship and perception of my mom (my mom is the bomb and one of my best friends, but she's also a parent). I also worry that my supervisor's preexisting relationship with my mom might make the things I say seem less valid/believable. I can only imagine how a client without a clinical background might think through it."
