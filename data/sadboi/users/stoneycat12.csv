As you stated in the story, he was placed in the class ""for socialization with the other kids"" and to be treated like the other kids. And you blatantly excluded him from the other kids, in a way that of course he was bound to find out.. Kids are a hell of a lot more observant than we think. I understand your side of it, I understand it was probably a really difficult decision to ultimately make. I'm sure there are ways to redeem the situation and turn it around, with some open mindedness and creativity. Maybe throw another little intimate party, sensory friendly, some classmates and him over for some snacks and a movie?"

relationship_advice,f55wayh,t3_dmybee,1572014728.0,"A little too much alcohol, and a couple of inconveniences too many, could've easily made for an angry boyfriend. In my humble opinion, you guys will be perfectly fine. You just need to give him a little time to get back to normal. Alcohol is a powerful depressant, so I wouldn't be surprised if his grumpy mood lasts a couple days following this - but he will (hopefully) eventually come around and realize he's being ridiculous and petty. Because that's what it is. Pettiness. He was angry at the guy pushing him around, he already had a narrative about the situation in his head, and he probably felt like you were against him too. 

Give him a chance to come around and see the situation rationally. That will be when you guys can sit down and talk things out without any sort of anger or backlash."

Don't beat yourself up. At least you recognized that it wasn't for you, and you're practicing self care by distancing yourself from something that made you uncomfortable. Use this time to reflect on yourself and think of something you can do that won't overwhelm you. Maybe a warehouse job where you don't have to work with the public? 

There's nothing to be ashamed of though.. And just remember, your mom doesn't fully understand the reasoning behind it. She'll be frustrated, but she will get over it soon enough. You're taking care of you, and you'll get back on your feet in no time.
