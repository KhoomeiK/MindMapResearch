this is unsolicited but just in case ya find this useful: when we started this project i had a shitty interface, a knockoff telecaster and a really bad condenser mic, but we still went forward with the band anyway. the best part about living in this age is that you don’t need the best gear or software to make music that you like remotely. do you own any instruments or anything like that?"

BPD,fcyfcgy,t1_fcydg83,1578079220.0,"this is incredibly helpful insight, super eloquent. 

my thing is how long do i sort of stay quiet / bite my tongue / give her space for before i am at liberty to ask if she’s ok again? or should i literally just get over myself? it’s taking a lot for me to not just immediately be like ‘what’s wrong please tell me’"
BPD,fcybebm,t1_fcyarvd,1578077634.0,"i'm not sure, it's sort of a problem because every now and then she'll be acting weird and distant because there actually is something wrong and then i have to pry it out of her. so it's this thing where sometimes i'm proven right that there's something wrong, so even when there isn't something wrong my brain immediately goes to the few times that i was right about there being something wrong"

YouOnLifetime,fc64mkd,t3_efszqy,1577472162.0,"Watched this season in a day completely on accident. 

I think a huge testament to how well this show was written is that I / my friends who watched kept finding myself sympathizing with Joe/Will at times, thinking ‘aw what a sweet moment’ when he had his romantic moments with Love...at points I even rooted for him ie with the Henderson storyline. But then the show has a way of ripping you out of it, reminding you he’s a literal psycho stalker killer and an non-self-aware misogynist (his angry comment voiceovers about how some media was so anti feminist...brilliant)

Best example I can think of is when Candace showed up to the Wellkend retreat. I literally was thinking to myself ‘god dammit Candace why would you ruin this for him!’ 

...and then they rip you out of it with flashbacks of Joe chasing her, physically assaulting her and literally BURYING HER ALIVE, and you realize oh. Yeah. He’s a piece of shit. A SCARY, dangerous piece of shit. 

They also really had an amazing way of writing the characters with good intentions and solid morals in relation to the Joe thing (Candace, Forty after he figured it out, Delilah and the cop) in a way that made the viewers really dislike them. Almost like a Skylar White situation with a few of them, especially Candace. 

The Love twist I absolutely did NOT see coming until approximately 5 minutes before she killed Candace. Will’s finally met his match in heaven (hell?) and oh boy oh boy is he not happy about it. A part of me genuinely thought Love would kill Joe/Will out of “love” and she would potentially become the next protagonist of You. A Concept?

I do think the last 5-10 minutes were a slight bit of a cop out but I’m not gonna pretend I’m some TV genius and could have done it better. 

Makes sense that the Quinn family made it all go away but at the same time I was envisioning a bit more of a ‘Graduate end scene’ setup of Will and Love looking at each other like they both realize they’re trapped and then season 3 becomes about them trying to fuck each other over, being absolute hypocrites and try to escape the relationship while dealing with the fact that they now have a kid...maybe that’s the direction they’re going in and I’m interpreting the last scene totally wrong, but to me it sort of seems like the plot of next season is that Wills gonna try to boink the neighbour and Love’s gonna probably try to kill her and him out of jealousy. 

Only one way to find out...."

I still haven't gotten anything back from anyone and now I'm trying to rethink, like, my entire life and what I'm supposed to do from here on out. I've been thinking they haven't been the greatest friends to me, especially one of them, for a while now but also I feel this desperation to make shit right again. I hope you're hanging in there though?"
BPD,eyirono,t1_eyir06z,1567106620.0,"Do you find that it's hard to distinguish between what's reasonable of them and what isn't though? i obviously don't know your situation exactly but for me specifically if i knew a friend had bpd and was going through an episode, and they said some really hurtful things to me, i'd be pretty mad for a while but ultimately forgive them as long as they're working on whatever it is they need to be working on. but then that's just me. so i can't decide if it's reasonable for them to leave me forever as their friend or not."
BPD,eyinbxy,t1_eyiln50,1567104760.0,it’s like i can’t distinguish between what’s valid of me to be upset about and what’s the bpd? like some stuff happened over the past week that has made me upset but i don’t think it was reasonable of me to do something like cut off two friends that I’ve been friends with for years now. what if i take time and they still don’t want anything to do with me? i don’t think i would either if i were them.
BPD,exilmc0,t1_exhuwhg,1566330811.0,"Yeah literally yes to all of this. Like 3 for example, I went two weeks going to the gym every single day, doing Intermittent Fasting, eating healthy. Like it was no excuses, even if friends wanted to hang out right after I work I wouldn't want to because I needed to go to the gym. Then I have one minor setback (a slight calf injury that only put me out for a couple days) and right now I'm in a place where I literally haven't been to the gym a single time in two weeks, eating out and really unhealthy binge eating every day."
BPD,ewyrhe8,t3_cqjgtd,1565885725.0,"For sure. I caught my mom cheating on my dad when I was 17. Long story but it was essentially through seeing some text messages. When I confronted her about it it somehow ended up getting completely brushed off. My dad never found out (I never had the heart to tell him but also my parents had a fucked up relationship).

I thought it was heinous and I would NEVER do that to anyone I dated, but lo and behold, fast forward 4 years and I cheated on my ex-girlfriend, gaslit her multiple times, and almost intentionally made her feel inferior by always keeping in touch with girls I’d slept with previously. My rationale for this at the time was that she was extremely clingy, wanted to tie me down ASAP and so I needed to find ways to prove she couldn’t do that. Fucked up, I know. I chalk it up to a combination of my mom making it seem like it wasn’t a huge deal, the BPD and also me just plain and simple being a really bad person at the time. 

But I think it’s really ultimately a good thing when people are open about the fact that they were the abuser, it means that they are self aware enough about the mistakes and that they’ll know or at least try to not make those same mistakes again. At least for me in my new relationship I haven’t done anything close to what I did to my poor ex gf and am now acutely aware when I feel like I’m about to lean towards doing it. 

It sucks but sometimes people make really shitty mistakes and hurt people and only after do they realize it. I still feel massive amounts of guilt but haven’t spoken to my ex in well over a year now, which I think is probably best for her because any attempts I would make at trying to apologize would be solely for my sake and not hers tbh."
