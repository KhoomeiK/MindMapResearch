Advice,fr3b6lu,t3_gm4nxs,1589853662.0,"I can see where you're coming from but going from one extreme to another is not helping as far as I experienced. It's very hard to be heartless and strong for long amount of time. You need a veery very good support mechanism for it, just to show your real face and be yourself.

I saw somewhere down there that it says ""allow yourself to get betrayed again and again."" It can make you heartless as well, but are you really want to live with the paranoia of even your best best friends can backstab you? At that point, it's not something that you can logically consider to feel and think. It's obligatory, like, you ain't got another choice to think. Your animal instinct will keep saying you to keep your guard up even with your most loved ones. It's not worth it. Just try to love yourself, it will solve all of the problems that you listed above."

It's a very good album nonetheless. The beats are different than what we used to listen mostly, you can see the influence of grime and and punk in it. For example ""Doorman"" is hell of a track, if you would say that it's from a punk album I would believe you. Jaykae and Skepta feats are great choices I think, they both got big landmark on UK music in general I think -Skepta mostly ofc-. Slowthai is always choosing beats that sound like straight of a horror flick and he's telling a story of him in a fucked up way everytime so it's enough to convince yourself that he's one mad man. I like the protest angle of view that he chooses as well in this one, he's not boring you with political shit, it's more like straight anger to the system and royalty that they think they got. He's not alienating you with it even if you're not from UK.

I was at a club at one time, I wasnt drunk, just enough to relax my nerves. I was waiting for my one friend but she didn't came. And I was like ""fuck you I'm not going to ruin that night""

I standed at the corner of the club for 5 minutes to spend some time to find people to approach to. I found a group of people that they're clearly coming from a different country as well. I pulled up that ""I know you from somewhere"" lame ass move to one of the girls but they were like ""no we don't so get out of there"" I was like ""okay chill"" so I went to the same corner that I was hanging.

I got crushed a little bit but, what could happen worst, I'm not gonna die anyway, it's a club and one of the main thing that you can do in the club is meeting with new people right? I standed at there for 10 more minutes to take my self confidince back, I found a group of more than 7 girls, they were all local university students, I'm not gonna tell how I did understood that, it's just how it is. I approached them, and said ""hey hello I came from x, and I'm quite associal, so I'm having hard time approaching people. But since I came here, I wanted to learn this countries language? May one of you help me with that?"". On God I said this stupid I want to learn this language thing at the club in the middle of the night, maybe 3 maybe 4. They were like,"" we couldn't but this girl could"" and I saw that amazing lady just staring at me and saying to me ""so you want to learn a little bit, but first you need to dance with me a LOT""

Rest is history.

Edit: I saw a better story than mine, and I felt like ""bro this balls are weighting more than +100 kilos""

The guy was standing at the club, approached a friend of mine - she's 9/10- and said ""you got great boobs, It's really looking great, congratulations for it"" and she laughed her ass off and said ""it was so weird but thank you"" the guy started to ask questions about what is your name, blablabla...

Next thing I know that they were kissing each other infront of everybody after 30 minutes


Moral of these stories: ask mosk stupid unimportant questions as you can at first, if you could make them laugh or if they could understand how stupid it is, they gonna understand that you're trying to approach them in a weird way and that type of confidence is attracting people. You're gonna fail sometimes, everybody can fail. But it's world. We gonna die anyway at some point and all of the stupid moments are gonna go under 6 feet. Who cares if somebody is thinking that I'm a douchebag or fuckboy or retarded anyway? I'm doing me -:)"

I'm 183 83 kg guy who has more muscles in his lower compared to the upper body. I should always choose slim fit jeans to show myself much more fit. I had face scars from accidents, I got broken nose, I had one big cystic acne right in front of my nose, I had surgery before but the redness is still standing at there. My nose is longer and ugly than usual. My face was 7/10 at max before all of this shit happen. I was standing in front of the mirror like I have so much shit to do just make myself attractive,and I'm 23 so yeah I'm caring about how I'm looking like.

But that's what all I got and I had so much room to improve myself in the means of being attractive. I started taking care of my body and my scars, I started to take care of what I'm eating, I started to doing sports and tried to make myself overall a better person mentally and psychally also. And you know what? It worked for some reason because all of the things that I'm doing for myself made me much confident about how I'm look and how I act because I thought that I deserve to hang around with beautiful and intelligent girls because all of the hard work that I was putting on myself. I started to impress women with my confidence which is coming from the hard work of being better version of myself. I am not the best version of myself right now, but even being on the road is adds up. 

You're a man, appearence is not the only thing that you can impress woman, you can get money more, you can be passionate about your goals about in your life, you can be great characterwise and believe it or not all of them are very big pros. 

Some of us are born handsome or beautiful, but that doesn't mean that you cannot reach that level. Just try it and enjoy the process. You're more than what you see in the mirror. Believe in it.

hiphopheads,fepg50l,t3_epvqgp,1579319652.0,"At least now we all know Royce can flow great on even one of the worst beats of this decade. Like yeah this guy can even rap on ringing noise of a church bell but in these beats how many bpm did he tried? I don't know 3,4?"
lgv30,fen6s7b,t3_eq1weg,1579278221.0,"I have Sony wh-ch700n and with Bluetooth the sound is sufficient, but with the cord, especially when the power is on, as mentioned above, painful to listen to. Still very very loud at 60 volume level but after 60 the sound is getting distorted, but believe me 60 is really ringing my ears and I'm a guy who's always listening at full volume. Not same headphone but both of them are Sony so I hope it helps"

hiphopheads,fdniaoc,t3_embou5,1578586390.0,Damn I forgot how old shit of The Game bangs. He's really one of the best from west coast. I'm just realising that the final album of his is a very sad moment for me and for all of my middle and highschool memories. Every beat that dropped on Doctors Advocate and The Documentary is still banging no matter what. I'mma check all of his discography start to finish again to make a playlist of his
hiphopheads,fde7hw8,t3_ekuuc2,1578332871.0,"Okay, so I'm following grime scene since Skepta released Man, right before it becomes famous worldwide so I'm not new. I like Stormzy, he got some heat yeah but if Wiley respond to this one, it's done. He got no morals or anything so he can come up with anything that he wants, and his voice is one of the most unique voice in the world for me. He's so aggressive, not that thicc but you can understand that he's not ""Netflix Bad Boy"", and the way he flows over tracks OMG. I'm waiting for this beef to get more serious -I don't want to see anything getting stabbed, that's not what I'm talking- and I hope Wiley is going to come with some personal shit.

Track is mental btw"
hiphopheads,fd9g5r8,t1_fd8opzi,1578232938.0,I think I played that album 90 hours or something that year. I wish they're gonna release with the sound of the MONICA this year tho. I don't know I didn't liked the verses but beat was very psychedelic IMO
hiphopheads,fd9fce7,t1_fd75i5t,1578232596.0,"I can see your point but as I said, just try another approach to it. If you're kind of person that don't want to listen anything related to trap, than there's nothing to do"
hiphopheads,fd6xeg7,t1_fd6l841,1578196911.0,"It's not mediocre actually. The expectations were kinda different when they released this single. Yeah at the first time that I saw this I was like ""Hell yeah they finally found balance between BoD and 3001"" but after they released ViH I was like wtf. But after some time I started to dig deep more and it ended up my most listened album of 2018 because of how polished and original is. The sound is different than normal trap sound, the context is hella introspectual, and some songs are the Zombies best bangers for me, for example like Mr. Bison, Hell-O, Proxies. They got their distinct touch on trap sound, that's for sure, and songs like U&I, Trapped, Facts were reeeaaally making me tripping. And you still got songs like Leather Symphony, Vacation, The Glory...

Take it as a playlist that got something from everything. Change your approach to it and I'm pretty sure that you will gave it at least 8. It's a complete project. You cannot except another MRAZ, Face Off, Minephuck, Redeye to Paris, Glorious Thugs, Butterfly Effect, Death 2 or Breakfast AT ePiffanies everytime. That's why these songs exist, they already did it

Edit: I just realized that I'm FIENDING for new FBZ"
hiphopheads,fczveby,t1_fcy9nlz,1578109265.0,"I'm not talking about the quality of the project, I'm talking about the sound of it. In fact, DAMN. was the worst project Kendrick had released since O.D.

I don't think Mick is aiming for the masses tho"
news,fczuvmo,t3_ejiqi1,1578109015.0,"As a Turk, I'm tired of seeing some shit is always happening right in front of our doorstep. Just guys, leave the Middle East alone. I don't want to see another war at somewhere else. If its going to happen, let them be how they want to be. Don't get involved with it"
hiphopheads,fcxphvh,t3_ejakcm,1578068416.0,"Maybe he should make a project like DAMN. to get his traction back. I couldn't name him top 10 of this generation but for sure he's ill as hell, and I'm believing he's always making music that makes me hype. I'm interested to listen what he's going to speak about next because the topics that he's on is always showing us a different perspective from his peers. This Chicago boys are ill as hell overall, I like Joey Purpp and Saba also. I wish they start to music together. All of them lost in their own lane but all of them intelligent guys. This is real hiphop boys, it's not just for the vibes but it's for the truth also. Imma support my man for the end, go for it Mick"
HeadphoneAdvice,fcmwthl,t3_ehxh7n,1577795816.0,"I have Sony wh-ch700n and sometimes I'm putting that on my hoodies hood, the sound quality is not suffering too much and it's not effecting isolation that much, maybe you should give that a try

Edit:Why the downvote for, can somebody explain to me?"
hiphopheads,fcm4v9a,t3_ehwa0n,1577764294.0,"That boy can rap, that's for sure. But with that weirdness, I'm expecting him to do something over lo-fi trap beats or idk, the thing he's doing is not that interesting for me."
hiphopheads,fckdyto,t1_fckdlkq,1577723185.0,"Audacity is my shit, but I didn't liked that project as much as I like other shit that Stormzy put out. I can see and respect what Stormzy is trying to do with it tho. I hope he will get worldwide like K Dot and J Cole at some point, he deserves it"
