keto,fr0w0v9,t3_glttil,1589808052.0,"I‚Äôve lost almost 165 pounds and been maintaining this weight for close to a month. While I would love to lose another 10 pounds to get to my ideal BMI of 20.5 it is very slow going now unless I drop under 1200 calories a day which is not sustainable to me and therefore not something I‚Äôm willing to attempt. You got so much good information in another response that I don‚Äôt have much to add besides personal anecdotes. 

I lost my weight very quickly especially in the beginning - about 10 pounds a month average being super strict on calorie and carb counting and never having any cheat days and maybe like 2 days where I went over 1400 calories. This won‚Äôt work for everyone but I am a very black and white thinker with this stuff so having protein goals I make sure to hit every day and calorie limits that I never go over worked well to keep me on track.

I tried OMAD and it is not sustainable to me so unless there are extenuating circumstances I eat lunch and dinner. No more breakfast ever, I don‚Äôt really miss it. I found a lunch combo that I absolutely love that fits great into my macros and have made a custom food entry in chronometer and eat that every single day. Cuts down extra time and complication with food logging. Dinners are always weighed out proteins - usually poultry or seafood as they are lower in calories and a vegetable side. If I have left over calories I eat some Lily‚Äôs chocolate that‚Äôs been weighed out.

I could go into more detail if you are interested. I do not exercise much at all. Hope this helps!"

news,fpo4vpe,t3_gej9kq,1588778413.0,I think this is for the best. I have a family member who is an essential employee in NYC and ended up getting covid. She had a lot of anxiety riding the subway because of the conditions and thinks that‚Äôs where she caught it.
loseit,fpo4if9,t3_gehyh7,1588778228.0,Thanks for the post. I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight and looking at maintenance very soon and these are all very valid points. It‚Äôs very inspiring to hear from people who have maintained a healthy weight for the long haul.
