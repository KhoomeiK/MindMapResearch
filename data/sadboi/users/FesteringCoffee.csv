Fitness,fi6xquq,t3_f6qygz,1582209934.0,"I have a question in regards to Macros:
So to start, since October 2019 I have been hitting the gym and I've sort of been winging it in regards to my diet. I avoid fast food, alcohol and sugary drinks at all costs and my diet is plant based, my weight went from 67kg to 69.4kg over the course of a month and this got me concerned about whether or not I've been letting my calorie intake get a lil out of hand.

I'm following the Wikis basic strength building guide and do cardio 2 days a week, despite my weight increasing and my stomach area hasn't really changed all that much since I started working out (there's some definition around my abdomen and If I tense I can just make out the top part of my abs but it's the area around my belly button that hasn't changed) 

So my question is: Are my macro concerns valid and should I start tracking it down to every number or am I worrying over nothing?
I've made good progress since I started in October but I'm sort of frustrated at the lack of change in my stomach region."
Fitness,fdgpq88,t1_fdgp87e,1578405052.0,"My body fat was pretty low when I started in October, I had lost 40kg over 2 years prior from not eating and strict dieting, I was really skinny with a small amount of podge in my abdomen when I started.

Fitness,fdgorli,t1_fdgogbq,1578404263.0,"It was somewhat surprising as for a few weeks I was deadlifting 45kg and it was awkward to lift but it wasn't a challenge, it wasn't until I jacked the weight upto 55kg still figured it was ""too easy"", moved it upto 60 then 65kg before I hit a challenging lift and then realised that I had been underestimating my own potential for weeks.

Fitness,fdgncmx,t3_el9ms8,1578403046.0,"I've been at the gym since October 2019, for the first few weeks I was not really following a program and just doing what I thought best. (Newbie error, I know)

I've been following the Wiki beginners strength building 3x5 guide for over 6 weeks now.  I've gone from:

Bench pressing 30kg to 42.5kg

Dead lifting from 40kg to 65kg 

Barbell row 25kg to 40kg

Seated smith machine shoulder press from Empty Bar to Bar + 15kg

Chin ups from 3x2 to 3x5

I feel and know I'm stronger but I'm not seeing it all that much physically. Especially in my biceps, should I incorporate one extra bicep workout into the routine, swap the program out completely or stop bitching and just carry on with it?

Teetotal,fa7msat,t3_e7xwiz,1575836136.0,"I'm 26 and I quit drinking August last year because I started treating alcohol as a coping mechanism. It started out as a payday end of the month treat, I'd get some cheap rum and down half the bottle while playing WoW and end up passing out. Like most stories involving alcohol it got worse eventually I started having a beer every night after work because at the time I was seriously hating my job. It was one night in August last year that something awful happened, I hit the bottle hard and spent early hours of the morning bringing it all back up in the toilet.

Since that day last year I swore I would never drink alcohol again, going teetotal at a young age may come off as silly but for me personally it's been the best decision I've ever made. I've hit the gym, dropped an ass tonne of weight, sleeping better and my finances are better off. 

I'm not much of a social person so the whole drinking with friends thing wasn't an issue as like I said I'm abit of a loner so nothing lost. 

TL:DR Alcohol was ruining my life so I gave it up and now I'm better off."
