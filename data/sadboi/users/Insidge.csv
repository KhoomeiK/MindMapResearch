I count my blessings and I am grateful for having traveled to many places. But that didn't fix my problems. Only temporary happiness which ended up in regret afterwards.  It's not where you go, its how you feel for a moment in your life. I am suffering from serious memory issues daily and suicidal thoughts. Does my country have anything to do with that? No. I fucked up myself. I am sorry for offending you, it wasnt my intention. Sorry man. And also, you dont think I wanted to help   everybody out if I had the money to do it? But I dont. The first thing I'd do if i was a billionaire would be going there and to help and improve as many people lives as I possibly could.

But sometimes I just have to prioritize myself. I dont know, time will tell I guess. I hope you will find peace and happiness in whatever you decide. And maybe I'll see you in the next life. If you believe in reincarnation. Or maybe its just pure Nothingness after death? I guess nobody knows for certain. Kinda terrifying to think about, I've been in a coma for about 10 days ago. And that is the closest I've been to dying. Well actually I've had countless of near death experiences.  But if I had to be hopeful and wish for what could be the ""afterlife"".

Or something like that, if that even makes any sense. Because deep down inside I know I will eventually do it. But the love and relationship I have with my few left family members are keeping me from acting out on my suicidal thoughts. As I've already experienced my dad committing suicide when I was 11 and I still have trauma from that. So therefore I cant get myself to do it. Even though it's a constant thought in my mind. But sometimes I wonder if I am causing them more suffering by actually staying alive. Since I am such a burden to them I feel. Honestly I think I am as confused as you are? Or maybe not?

depression,ffo6lwl,t1_ffntaej,1580074653.0,"Yea I also keep telling myself that, but it never seem to get better apparently.  I feel what you mean, it hurts so much knowing they dont care as much as you initially thought. Even my sister promised to visit me this week, after my suicide attempt and I have heard no calls or messages from her. Like wtf. 

Death doesn't scare me as much anymore, or maybe it does. Actually I am in doubt of what to make out of these experiences. I also nearly died a few weeks ago from eating too many hbwr seeds and blue lotus tea. I remember lying down puking and suddenly everything went black and it could see my whole life replay. And I remember waking up looking at all the doctors and nurses trying to talk with me. Before I passed out I had posted a goodbye message on Facebook. And somehow my sister saw it at the exact moment I wrote it. And if she hadn't seen it and called the ambulance for me. I would've been dead now. 

I felt so psychotic and thought I was dead or near death at the hospital. And the doctors told me about 18 hours later that I had been lying down screaming out loud ""dad"" for several hours. And they weren't able to get in contact with me. I got some anti psychotic meds as I woke up. But i swear i thought i was dead. I felt like the world was a fucking game or something. I couldn't even understand what they were saying. 
But if I hadn't told my sister what I had consumed 5 minutes before passing out. The doctors probably wouldn't have been able to save me. Since they wouldn't know which antidote to give me. 

And in 2019 I have also experienced a near death situation, it was night and I had been drinking some wine or was it beer? And some of my friends had given me some weed to smoke. Never mix those two!!! I'll tell you now. Since I ended up sitting in my room at my desk, smoking and suddenly I had to puke. But the muscles that helps you do that for you didn't work. Or at least I couldn't use them properly. And It resulted in me freaking out and I couldn't breath for about approximately 30 seconds I guess it was. But the fact that I sat there alone, being suffocated in my own vomit. And being so close to dying was an unreal experience. Actually I wasnt even thinking of my family during those seconds. I was just thinking about. Okay this is my end, and kinda accepted it and weird as it sounds. I was actually quite excited for my life to finally end. But you know, human survival instinct is very strong. So I panicked and kept telling myself to stay alive and puke it out. Somehow i managed to survive that. 

I also managed to survive drinking 1 whole vodka bottle and taking 2k mg quetiapin. And of course I ended up being saved by my friends. After passing out on their couch. As they told me the days after I went home from the hospital.  

Another time I think I almost died was when I had taken 4x times the recommend dosage of elvanse and had stayed up for 3 days in a row and had  repeatedly been taking those pills for days. I remember the euphoria was beyond amazing for the 4 first times I took the pills. But I did the mistake, that I think most addicts do.  I was chasing the initial high. But ended up walking around my friends house paranoid/psychotic for 3 days. I couldn't even recognize myself in the mirror at all. I had previously experienced this depersonilization before or whatever it's called. Its extremely terrifying, I remember also drinking loads of energy drinks during those 3 days too. How my heart could have survived that I dont know. Since before that I hadn't slept properly for weeks or months. Also what scared me the most was the pain in my chest and the fear or my heart was gonna explode at anytime. And I kept telling my friends that I couldn't feel any cold or heat in/on my body and I couldn't feel pain. I am honestly quite curious how that was possible and how those vyanse pills had affected my brain. 

Anyway now I try to stay away from all drugs, but I still suffer from anxeity and I feel like the world isn't real anymore. As I did 1 year ago. Before my drug abuse started.  I just seriously regret being so stupid and doing all these things to myself. My memory is beyond messed up now and I seriously cant remember a single holiday in my life anymore. And what I did 1 hour ago.  But I actually appreciate life more now, but I am also more suicidal at the same time. I know it doesn't make sense. But it's the truth.  Or maybe I am just confused and mentally damaged by those drugs and traumatic events that all happened during 2019 and the start of 2020.  The only positive thing from all the anxiety attacks is when they're over and you get this euphoric feeling for a short while. But I would rather have someone cut off my finger than have to live with anxeity attacks every night or second."

SuicideWatch,ffnp73o,t3_eubjej,1580068852.0,"I completely understand how you feel, I've always been telling my mom I didn't want to live any longer since I could talk. I am constantly thinking of committing suicide and I've tried countless of times with OD of drugs. But everytime I've survived or somebody found me in time. I cannot keep living with the fact that I am a worthless human being and have no purpose. As I grow older and older I start to realize and understand why my father committed suicide when I was 11 y.o. but some part of me wants to keep living just for the sake of not ruining my sisters and moms life. It's a constant battle in my mind. I think most people that doesn't have depression, they will never fathom or get why some commit suicide. I struggle with finding a meaning with my life and I think most of us do. But why live in this suffering day after day? I also have daily anxiety attacks every night before sleep and also haven't slept properly for weeks if not years. And my memory is totally fucked up due to my drug abuse. Which I now regret more than anything. And I know the damage to my brain is irreversible. Which makes it even more hard to live with. I used to be so smart and had so much self confidence. But now I am just a loser with nothing to do. I've had so many near death experiences in my life and I dont know how I could have survived all these things. And not more than about 5 days ago I was in a coma. And it was complete darkness and no thoughts and dreams like when you're sleeping. It was like I was dead. Waking up was like being born again. Besides the fact that It was the same life i woke up to. I know my memory will only get worse as I grow older, and I will lose my mom. I honestly think the day that happens..then I am also gone from this planet. Its like I am living just for her. Because i know how much sorrow and misery she's been through with cancer and losing my dad. And then if I killed myself. That would devastate her too much. I guess I just gotta keep suffering until I finally get the courage to hang myself or freeze to death in the snow like my dad. I used to love my life so much. But it all changed in 2018. I lost everything and hit rock bottom. I am sad and have empathy for what you're going through. I hope the very best for you. Just know you are not alone with this feeling."

LSA,fez52we,t1_fderxgk,1579453939.0,"I mixed 6x hbwr seeds and 1 gram of blue lotus 20x extract. After 40 mins after consuming it I was in total fear/paranoid/terror and made a facebook post. Writing goodby, because I seriously felt like I was destined to die that night . 2 mins later my sister called me and I couldn't even speak properly. And I tried to explain what I had consumed. I was telling her how much I love all of my family and saying thanks for everything, because In my mind i felt like this was the end. She told me to throw up. But I couldn't, and then 5 later I just layed there on the ground, in the bathroom with some white foam running out my nose and mouth. Then I cant remember anything else but awaken up at the hospital. The people around me looked like monsters and all I could think of in my mind was theories about what happens after death.i truly felt so psychotic and terrified the whole time and i was thinking the seeds was gonna kill me at any second. Or was it just  a bad trip? All my mind did was replaying all the most trauma I've experienced throughout my life. And I literally saw my whole life flash before me. Was I fine or was It the drugs that made me feel like I was dying? I felt so psychotic when I came down. Or could the 6 seeds really have killed me? If I didn't get help from the doctors and the meds they gave me?  Seriously the most terrifying experience of my life. I even saw a tunnel with a different coloured light at the end of it. I did wash the seeds and peel the outer coating of off them first. And when I came to my senses the doctors told me I had been screaming for my mom and dad to save me for 8 hours straight. I just wanna know if I would have been fine if I had stayed out of the ER?  Or if I really was experiencing a near death experience? Side note. I suffer from severe depression and anxeity since I  saw my dad commit suicide when I was 11 y.o.  I know I am stupid from trying psychedelics.  But I guess I just wanted to escape this world and was hoping for some clarity into my failures in my life and I did. But I cant put to words how terrifying this experience was. After 2 days now I still feel terrified and have had the most insane vivid dreams. Its quite weird tho, because it has made me more tempted to kill myself and curious of death.  But it has also made me appreciate life way more. Or maybe I am just still in a confused state of mind.  Last thing I will add to this, is that during the time at the ER I also had a out of body moment and it felt like time was slowed down by a million times.  Sorry for the rant. I just want someone to explain if I was having a bad trip or if I was really about to die from those seeds. 
Pt. I hadn't slept for 3 days prior to what happened.  If that had made it worse or was a good thing is also something I am curious about. 
I've been having a hard time  comprehending my surroundings and life in general since this happened. And I have a hard time thinking clearly and understanding simple sentences. 
The doctors described me with anti psychotic meds. But It hasn't worked yet i feel. Please someone tell me i will be alright and if I was really near death or just a bad trip? 
Pt2. I was in coma from about 5 days before this happened from nutmeg and benzos/alcohol OD. 
And last Christmas I had a blackout and swallowed 20mg xanax and had drank 5 beers.  How could I survive that too? I am wondering if my dad or some kind of guardian angel is keeping me from dying. Also about 3 months ago I was close to dying from weed and alcohol, I had vomit stuck in my throat and couldn't throw up and couldnt breath for about I think 50 seconds. But managed to throw it up and was so scared after that. I just wonder why I keep getting so lucky with surviving all these events?  I know I will die and I am fighting a battle between wanting to die and fearing it. Plus I dont wanna ruin my sisters and my moms life if I commit suicide. What's wrong with me? I seriously have mixed feelings about wanting to die and hopefully see my dad in heaven, (if that is a real thing) and not wanting to leave and ruin my families life. By keep going on with these insane actions I commit. I hope just 1 person reads this. I am not sure if I can be here any longer. 😭😭😭"
