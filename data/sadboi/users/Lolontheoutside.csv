depression,ev6zxdc,t3_cig81w,1564253439.0,"Life is one of those track meets with the hurdles. You’re ready to go full steam ahead and boom there’s one hurdle you get it and  think OK I’m OK and boom there’s another hurdle sometimes we can’t get over that hurdle and we have to stand up and wipe our knees and keep going I guess but that’s how I see life one hurdle after another.  And there are times at the hurdles just come too fast for you to recuperate. 

And once in a while life gives you a little more time between the hurdles but we’re so used to them we can’t enjoy that downtime. 

I guess just get over one hurdle at a time and try to be proud that you made it. Good luck to all of you and God bless you. 

Be kind to yourself don’t be your own worst enemy."
depression,etufd6y,t3_cdgwtu,1563211324.0,"Take it all one minute at a time.  Have something to eat, make a list of small steps you would like to make and do them one at a time.  Brush your teeth, brush your hair, smile. You can make yourself happy - don’t count on others to make you happy or you’ll never be happy. Live for yourself and f**k what others expect of you. Take care.   And learn to love yourself."
depression,et71rqs,t3_ca505i,1562523053.0,You’re 19 you never have to see him again and no one can force you.  What are his beautiful daughters accomplishing?  I’m sure as hell when he needs a doctor he will be calling. I’m also sure he won’t be looking for looks in a doctor.  He will be looking for brains and most likely for someone he doesn’t need to pay.  He is your crippling cancer and you should cut him out of your life and live your life without his insults.  People are such garbage. Sometimes you need to cut your losses. They are negatives and you deserve positives on your life. I hope I make sense because I am just really upset by people that intentionally hurt people for no reason.  Take care if YOU. and screw the rest. God bless you.

depression,es7d25h,t3_c61wtx,1561668418.0,I hear you. People are so into their damn selves. Last year 2 of my 3 sisters forgot my birthday and I live with them. Not only that it was my 55th birthday and they are all older. Talk about a kick in the gut.  All of my coworkers forgot it too.  It’s hard to see that you/me are so considerate and remember everybody’s birthday and they can’t remember yours.   I always text at midnight to be the first one to say happy birthday. Oh well. Have A NICE day and celebrate yourself🌼🎂🌸 🎉
depression,epnxus3,t3_bv7cad,1559335211.0,"Love yourself.  Take care of yourself.  Spoil yourself.  Only then can you really be loved.  When you know yourself, what you like and that you are lovable.  Good luck to you. ♥️"
depression,epit8en,t3_buq56r,1559242977.0,"My favorite is when I’m asked “why are you so angry and nasty?”  Geez, I don’t know I think those are nice traits to have asshole?  Maybe it’s because everyone has their own heads so far up their own asses they can’t see you dying and suffering right in front of them.  I really wish I could just go off somewhere where no one will even want or need to talk to me except for like “business exchanges”.  I really don’t want to have to try to explain to someone what I myself don’t understand about depression and this eternal internal sadness - worthlessness.    I would feel soooo much better alone.  Others are what make you feel “odd”. “Worthless”. “Crazy”. “Unstable”.  And when you look at them you realize that honestly it’s everyone else that is so F**KED UP.   Life is a struggle face it.   Okay I’m done ranting - I hope this makes at least one other person feel a little better about themself.   GOD BLESS US ALL!!!"
