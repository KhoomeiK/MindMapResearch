- you have a steady income and relatively secure job or career
- you have no debts, or very low/manageable debts to income. 
- you will stay in the area for 5 years or more. property tends to increase in value over the long-term, but buying and selling within a few years can be a loss after all the moving costs and mortgage paperwork, inspections, etc. 
- you have an emergency fund of at least 3 months of savings
- you have a down payment in addition to the emergency fund, 20% or more is ideal to avoid Private Mortgage Insurance but not always possible with a first time purchase. 
- the mortgage will be a max of about 3x gross household income with a payment of no more than about 25% after-tax income per month. 

so with a $40k income you could potentially afford a house in the $120k range at a max, which seems realistic in your situation. assuming you have emergency savings and *something* towards a down payment. but don't rush into it. there's a house on every corner.

edit: a rule of thumb for repairs is that you need to plan on an average of 1-2% of the house's value in repairs, per year. that's an average, not year in and year out. for a $100k home that's $1000 to $2000 per year, but some years will have $0 repairs and other years will need major roof work for $5000. this is why the emergency fund is critical, so you don't have to use credit cards, and is why the low debt level is critical, so you don't have payments up to your eyeballs and zero cash flow for repairs and replenishing the emergency fund."

my advice? you and brother paying off the debts and taking ownership of the property is an option. but *do not* attempt this on your own. the county recorder's office will accept any paperwork you want to file, it's not their job to verify that such paperwork is legally binding or accurate. so DIY quit claims or other paperwork often backfires, clouding the title and causing other headaches that need to be sorted out in court. go get opinions from a few real estate lawyers and CPAs. pay a few hundred bucks to avoid thousands in tax bills or court fees down the road."

>I am considering leverage because worst case, I will be able to make the monthly payments from my income so ok with the reward/risk. 

making payments is not the worst case scenario. you also need to consider the possibility that the lender calls the loan. there's usually fine print allowing them to call 100% of the loan under certain conditions. you need to prepare not only for monthly payments, but for the possibility they demand $40k by the end of the month. $40k bill plus court summons for a shady business deal is the worst-case scenario. (edit: and lawyer fees are part of the worst case scenario). 

you also need to consider the possibility the investment opportunity fails completely and you're stuck with the debt. low-risk investments usually have low returns (definitely lower than 11% per year). high risk investments usually have high volatility and high risk of some type of collapse/backfire. there are mutual funds that average in the 11-12% range for long periods, but that's an *average* and they rarely plug along predictably earning 11% per year, each year. more likely they're up 30%, down 8%, up 25%, up 3%, down 9%, up 17% and it averages out to 11% growth over a 20 year period. you can expect earnings above 11% from some types of real estate and business ownership, but again: there's a lot more risk and hassle involved. so dig a little deeper into this investment opportunity to ensure you fully understand the plan and to know they've told you everything. smells fishy to me. maybe contact the SEC or similar state agencies to see if this company or the people involved have a history of shady business deals."
personalfinance,fojgqzo,t3_g7oy1z,1587820444.0,"a few thoughts, some of which may not apply to your scenario: 

- food costs can be more expensive in some areas (e.g. Hawaii). so there might be a practical limit on how low you can go. 

- food can be a very emotional subject, with lots of family and cultural baggage. so it can be a bit like therapy to examine your food habits. if you think ""We've got to eat X, we ALWAYS eat X"" that's where to start questioning things. ""We ALWAYS eat steak on Saturday nights. we ALWAYS buy from Supermarket Z."" why do you always eat steak on Saturdays? what if you just stopped or changed to every other week? would it kill you? no. What if you shopped at Supermarkets A or B instead of Z? would the world stop spinning? no. these are just habits. they can change. 

- meat is expensive. for health reasons, most Americans could dramatically cut their meat intake (especially processed & red meats). meat is usually high in saturated fats and is directly linked to colon cancer. grilling red meat is a carcinogen. if you gave up meat 3 days a week, or switched from red meat to poultry, it could cut your food budget a lot. and make meat less of an entree or more of a side dish or constituent (go from a full t-bone steak to steak strips in an Asian stir fry with lots of vegetables for example). ditto to an extent for dairy ... cheeses can get costly and unhealthy. 

- juice, soda and similar drinks are also extremely expensive (per ounce, compared to water) and lots of people drink too much of these. cutting soda etc could save a lot of money in a shopping budget, and be better for health. 

- bottled water is insanely profitable and also extremely expensive (per ounce, I mean ... look at the cost for a gallon of bottled water vs. per gallon from the city on your next water bill). if buying it, consider getting a Britta type filter jug instead. most bottled water is just filtered tap water, anyway. 

- food waste is a big problem in America. people tend to buy and prepare far too much food, then throw it out a week later. so start tracking not only what you BUY but also what you DISCARD. if you're regularly throwing out X, Y or Z ... stop buying so much X, Y or Z in the first place. 

- once or twice a year when things are on sale, we stock up on non-perishables. canned veggies, beans, fruit and some soups; dry pasta; rice, etc. this way we've always got something on hand that can serve as a foundation for a meal (pasta) or emergency rations if for example there's a weird pandemic lockdown and you're not supposed to leave the house. sounds weird, but it could happen a virus spreads rapidly from some far corner of the world. canned soups can be high in sodium, but on days when you don't want to cook can add some low-salt broth and fresh veggies so perk it up a bit.

- not all carbs are created equal. whole grains are slower to digest, so you feel full longer and blood sugar doesn't spike. brown rice, brown bread and whole-grain pasta are a lot more filling and you get more bang for your buck. 

- beans and garbanzos are very cheap, very filling and one of the healthiest things you can eat. they're very versatile and can be an entree (chili), side dish or whipped/mashed and hidden (in a soup, for example)"

pay to delete might not be an option, but you can get a note attached to your credit file saying the debt has been paid, settled or closed. this looks better than if a debt was still open and active. 

if it's gone to collections, you can usually settle it for less than the full amount. maybe somewhere between 30 and 60% of the original balance. usually takes some back and forth negotiation, and remember that the collector probably paid 10 cents on the dollar for the right to collect this debt."

Chomsky is a hack who routinely lies and distorts the facts and who has a history of defending brutal and genocidal regimes. http://paulbogdanor.com/200chomskylies.pdf


okay, the publisher's page opens for Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism opens with: 

>In the past few decades, the wages of most workers have stagnated,

this is a falsehood. wages are stagnant only on the *household* level, and households have changed dramatically over the last few decades. when you look at wages for *individuals*, the vast majority of people's wages more than keep up with inflation and the majority of Americans are in the top 20% and the bottom 20% of incomes, only at different times in their lives. household income comes from *census* data, individual incomes come from *IRS* data. see Economic Facts and Fallacies by Thomas Sowell. so how we supposed to take seriously an economist who doesn't appear to understand that he's confusing two different data sets?"
