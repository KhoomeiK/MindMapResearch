Haven’t eaten in days. Can anybody help me with this problem?"

NarcissisticAbuse,fmm8poi,t3_ftsi4p,1586200864.0,"Law of Attraction. My NEX couldn’t go a day without spilling wine, tripping, hitting her head on something, backing into a parked car, her bank account got hacked, debit card got stolen. It was always something, and usually on days where she’d woken up treating me like trash from the getgo. And her day would get worse and worse as she made me feel like shit, in turn making her treat me even worse because if she wasn’t having a good day, nobody was allowed to have a good day."
NarcissisticAbuse,fkgfyh0,t1_fkgfosh,1584158545.0,"Thanks so much for this thoughtful response! I’m so sorry you had to go through all of that turmoil. The focusing on “one little thing” during an argument really resonated with me. I swear she could’ve murdered somebody and would argue with me about how I used a word that was too harsh when accusing her of her alleged murder lol (no, she did not murder anybody, just wanted to stress her behavior)."
NarcissisticSpouses,fkfs7to,t3_ebuqlb,1584141298.0,"I just spit out my drink because of how accurate this is. Almost wanna send her a screen shot of this but then I’d be reprimanded for the rest of the day about how “it’s not true,” “it’s not funny,” and it would end with me apologizing saying I didn’t mean it."
NarcissisticAbuse,fkfqfgp,t1_fkfq79k,1584140178.0,Wow thank you! I’m still trying to educate myself about this as much as I can. This will be a really helpful read.
