bipolar,f28kka4,t3_dci4yu,1570063907.0,"It does sound like you are confused and in a lot of (psychological?) pain. Bipolar plus GAD is a huge burden to cope with even with medication, so unmedicated it's no wonder you find yourself struggling with daily life. It does sound like you have a good plan, though, getting back in to see a psychiatrist. Given your good plan you might be thinking more clearly than you realize. It seems that you have some good judgement shining through despite your distress. Take care."
bipolar,ezqeyws,t3_d1vlhx,1568058366.0,"Wow, you are 100% correct. Finding the best medication for you, something that works well for you with the fewest side effects, takes a lot of courage. The trial-and-error period is miserable. An available great doctor is a necessary part of the search. If you get sick with side effects and can't reach the prescriber or anyone, it's beyond awful. It's also unethical for the health care professional not to be available unless there is someone covering for him/her."
ptsd,ezq5j4b,t3_d1utm2,1568055045.0,"Thank you for telling us the good news. It's great that the ketamine infusion helped. The medical literature has supported the possibility of an occasional medical near-miracle result from it. It should be safe under the kind of close medical supervision you're getting. It's also true, though, that ketamine doesn't work for everyone. And for some people it works but for that person the side effects might be too bad to continue.  It's quite an opportunity that you found this government-sponsored clinical trial."
bipolar,eyuupx9,t3_cyxkfk,1567472655.0," A few ideas, maybe. (1) He's still around. Maybe he likes you the way you are. (2) Maybe think up a different answer to, ""What's wrong?"" Instead of ""Nothing"", maybe that you're just anxious or something. Saying ""nothing"" every time seems to irritate you, even if it doesn't irritate him. (3) On the unmedicated, are you implying that maybe medication would help? It might be worth a try."
autism,ey5fsyt,t3_cvoplc,1566830578.0,Excellent and remarkable. You might well have a budding paleontologist in your home. Keep up the good reading and education.
aspergers,exfhkll,t3_csl2c9,1566240705.0,One might gently suggest that you see someone and have a real evaluation. It seems to me that it would be nice for you to really know yourself.  Here's a page that might help with the why and how of such an evaluation: [https://www.neuroscirandd.com/treatment-of-medical-illnesses-based-in-the-neurosciences/autism/](https://www.neuroscirandd.com/treatment-of-medical-illnesses-based-in-the-neurosciences/autism/)
migraine,ew5ik6j,t3_cmy0e9,1565137135.0,"Don't have an explanation but have noticed a similar pattern. Years ago (before sumatriptan/Imitrex) when my migraines were severe and would put me in bed for a day, I noticed that the evening before a migraine I most always felt great. Full of energy, social, doing things, optimistic. Then the next morning I'd awaken barely able to get out of bed with a severe, crushing migraine."
bipolar,ew5hjan,t3_cmy9dg,1565136423.0,"Perhaps it means that you appear to be so well put together that the helpful stranger could never in a million years believe that you have a ""mental health"" problem yourself and thus, chides you on your presumed insensitivity.  It could be an odd compliment, but only if one believes there is anything wrong with having a ""mental"" illness."
migraine,ev357p6,t3_ciazb9,1564189453.0," We all know what you are talking about. What you are describing is common to migraine sufferers. Interesting about the triptans like sumatriptan. Before we had these better effective treatments for migraine everyone only knew about and focused on the headache, nausea, and awful feeling. Once we had these better treatments the smaller but still really irritating symptoms came out from behind the curtain.  We're with you and we agree. Here are a couple of links that talk about this part of migraine syndrome. - [https://www.neuroscirandd.com/treatment-of-medical-illnesses-based-in-the-neurosciences/migraine-disorder-not-just-a-headache/](https://www.neuroscirandd.com/treatment-of-medical-illnesses-based-in-the-neurosciences/migraine-disorder-not-just-a-headache/) \- [https://www.neuroscirandd.com/migraine-treatment/](https://www.neuroscirandd.com/migraine-treatment/) \-"
schizophrenia,ev32m6g,t3_ciagun,1564188080.0," Wow, that's really an artistic drawing whether it's illustrating an hallucination or just a drawing. You've got talent. Well done."
bipolar,esmo91x,t3_c8g8k5,1562110360.0,"Wow, this is great. It's absolutely true and on target. My only reservation is that, if you have to say this to someone, will they get it even after you say it.  The German poet Friedrich Schiller once wrote, ""Against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain."" But I do love it and it feels good to say snap out of being ignorant. Even it they can't."
schizophrenia,esj5hgg,t3_c81vwu,1562026399.0,"I would offer to you that it should not matter if your doctor understands what brain zaps are. What should matter is that you are taking ziprasidone and it's causing an adverse reaction that is extremely uncomfortable. There are many, many medication choices available. (See [https://www.neuroscirandd.com/treating-schizophrenia/](https://www.neuroscirandd.com/treating-schizophrenia/)).  I suggest you talk with her, reiterate that you are extremely uncomfortable, and you need the adverse reaction to stop. Ask her what med she would suggest you try next. In terms of a medical term, side effect or adverse reaction should be enough."
depression_help,epctd7k,t1_epcqdug,1559158218.0,"I might suggest talking with the PCP in as matter-of-fact, business-like way as you can. You've got these symptoms, you think probably they're in the psychiatry realm, but you're not sure. Are they endocrine (thyroid, diabetes)? Are they neurology (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis)? Etc. Ask him/her to help you rule out non-psychiatry causes. Tell him/her that if it's psychiatric you'll ask for a referral to a good (I emphasize good) psychiatrist.  I feel it's unlikely he/she will think you're crazy, rather you're just asking for help."
depression_help,epcodj0,t3_buidyt,1559156554.0,"My advice would be to start with a PCP to confirm that these symptoms are something in the psychiatry area and not some other medical cause. If your troubles are psychiatric get a referral from the PCP to a good psychiatrist. As you say, you need medication, you tried therapy. If you need therapy in addition to a medication that works, the psychiatrist can refer you to a psychologist or provide the therapy himself/herself."
