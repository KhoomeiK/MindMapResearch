PrettyLittleLiars,fqeh0ul,t3_gigssy,1589307415.0,"I think 2017ish was when the era of the typical teen dramas like PLL, Gossip Girl, TVD, Teen Wolf etc. ended. That's why Riverdale isn't doing as well as these shows - it's a lot like these plotholed but loveable shows but the era is done. Now more realistic teen dramas are the new thing and tbh they don't have the homely feeling the OG ones (especially PLL ) do"
