It's a kids movie with loads of hidden layers. And the animation is just beautiful. I can watch this movie over and over again and it still makes me feel things.

sex,fed035m,t3_eoip8o,1578991972.0,"If you feel more comfortable with him wearing a comdom. You should obviously tell him. Also perhaps ask why he can't finish if he's wearing one (perhaps he becomes desensitized because regular condoms are too tight, maybe he should try a different size condom) And discuss other ways to make him finish, if you want, so it's still pleasurable for him in a way.

Besides that it's not necessary to wear a condom if you've been taking your birth control correctly AND both of you are free from STD's/STI's since only condoms protect you from those. Birthcontrol is usually 99% effective so there really isn't any risk and the 1% usually counts in human errors and other factors like medicine or throwing up (if you're taking the pill) that could reduce the effect of the birthcontrol you're taking.

Discuss it with you partner, and most of all, relax and have fun :)"

Antibacterial cream could dry out the area Rinse it with saltwatersolution to keep it sterilized and try avoid touching it for as long as possible. Small bandaid is smart, but make sure it doesn't put any/ a lot of pressure on your piercing."

Does she have any experience having an orgasm by herself? Then she'll know what it feels like and she can tell you when she has one.

AskReddit,fc2p5yy,t1_fc2deh8,1577369806.0,"Honestly that sounds great. Keep up the good work. I think not only telling your kids they can tell you everything, but also showing them how to communicate with you in a respectful and calm manner by showing them instead of getting angry is the best. I think there's a lot of parents who tell their kids they can tell them everything. But they leave it hanging at that and proceed to yell at their kids when they try to correct their parents. Trust comes from both ways. I think that by doing this you show your kid that he can discuss every thing with you which makes him much more emotionally available."
