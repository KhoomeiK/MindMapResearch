depression,fpa5ys8,t1_fp2d3l4,1588441488.0,Totally agree.
depression,fp1ruwx,t1_fnwk3tc,1588245888.0,"Completely agree! Of the free pages I've found, the resources available don't really care. They're just there for the paycheck or for what they feel would make their resume look good."
lonely,fp1rqj1,t3_ga7tky,1588245777.0,"This is completely me! If people ask me how I'm doing, I will lie and say that I'm ok because no one wants to hear that I'm feeling extremely depressed. On the other hand, I'll ask people ""how are you feeling today?"" and they will proceed to open up and tell me everything. When I've tried to tell people how I'm actually feeling, I got dismissed, told I was being weak and wanted attention, told to never talk about how I was feeling with anyone, the list goes on and on."
depression,fnwapts,t1_fnw321q,1587314768.0,"I totally agree with you. I know so many people, family, so called friends, etc, that if and when I die, will definitely pretend to ""care"". They will say things like, ""I never knew how much pain she was in. She could have come and talked to me, etc. etc."" while talking to people; however, behind closed doors, they won't care in the slightest. It's sad but true. :("
lonely,fn57428,t3_fz2dcn,1586657524.0,"So true! Even when I was around others, I felt so alone. No family, no friends, nothing."
lonely,fm2g83x,t3_fs8hfw,1585696857.0,"It's rough. I'm thinking about my ex less now, but more about my family, especially my mother. They want nothing to do with me and it hurts so bad. It's been years now. :("
SuicideWatch,flusjez,t3_fraf8a,1585509137.0,I thought I was the only one that felt like this. I'm a high risk person due to a weak immune system but I purposely avoid the CDC recommendations about avoiding crowds and situations that may expose you to COVID-19. I just done care anymore.
depression,fkv2i7x,t3_fkoq0k,1584560707.0,"I can relate. I'm always checking on others, no one bothers to see how I'm doing (at least the people I thought were friends). Right now, my depression is so bad, I'm just walking around wearing a mask so I don't feel anything and my pain is hidden."
lonely,fkv0u36,t3_fke4nv,1584559793.0,"Yes, any movie, romantic or ones where the man goes to save the woman and they realize they were meant to be together, those are extremely triggering for me."
depression,fdw1dcq,t1_fdvmb5m,1578754070.0,"Exactly! I've told my GP that me getting out of bed is one thing. I can kinda make myself do that but, asking me to try and take care of my personal needs, lets not even mention getting up to go into the kitchen to make myself a bowl of cereal, or even go outside, is expecting waaaaayyyyy tooo much! I do realize that others are in worse situations that I am, and I definitely have empathy for them and everyone experiencing those situations, but I don't have the energy or motivation to do or feel anything - I don't even feel my own pain. I'm walking around like a zombie, just kinda disconnected from any and everything."
depression,fdvgbfx,t3_emnl5m,1578747136.0,"I was just thinking this. Yesterday, I told someone that I was dealing with severe major depression and had been for years. I was told to just ""change your thinking"" and ""stop being so hard on yourself - that's where you're messing up."" I had to end the conversation there. I already feel like I'm not worth existing and that I already do everything wrong, and this person just added another thing that I'm doing wrong. Thank you!!!!! I was also told to not tell anyone else. Honestly, it doesn't need to be cancer, just something physical and visible that people would be more willing understand. Almost two years ago, it was discovered I had a brain tumor - it was successfully removed. People at work were more supportive and understanding. Now, I'm dealing with a very serious depressive episode and I'm being told to ""think positive"", ""be happy"", ""go volunteer, that will make you see how much better you have it"", ""just snap out of it"" on and on and on.... Now, if I had died due to the tumor, that would be more ""accepted"" than if I die from depression and suicide. I would be called a ""coward, selfish, weak."" People would say ""oh, I never knew. She never told anyone she was feeling like this."" When in all actuality, I had, people just didn't want to hear it. I want others to just live in my head for a week so they can understand what we go through on a daily basis. People just don't have any empathy for anything they can't see and understand."
depression,fcvfbcl,t1_facui97,1578000897.0,"I'm sorry for taking so long to reply. Things have been really hard. I spend all of my days feeling nothing. I try to cry, nothing happens. A social worker told me to talk to someone, there is no one. I was so angry when I woke up January 1st because I swore to myself that I wouldn't make it to 2020."
depression,fcvek6a,t1_fcss2g4,1578000452.0,"Yes! That and saying ""God gives His hardest battles to His strongest soldiers"". I didn't ask to be a soldier, plus, I've been fighting battles since I was little. How many more battles do I have to fight? What is the test here? How long is this test supposed to go on? How long is the ""strongest soldier"" supposed to stay strong? I'm literally physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. I don't have the energy and just don't want to do this anymore."
depression,fbswa2f,t3_ee58qm,1577061915.0,"My mother did the exact same thing. She'd talk about me on the phone to others saying that I was ""emotional"" or ""I'm just doing everything for attention"". The last statement is what she said after I was almost successful with a suicide attempt. Although it has taken me quite a while to do this, in the last 3 years, I have cut all ties with her and the rest of my family. For the most part, it has helped me although it does get difficult for me around the holidays. 

I know it's easier said than done but, just try to hold on. Stay strong and just prepare for when you can move out on your own. Come here and vent to us, we're here for you. <3"
depression,facblq7,t1_fac8nc1,1575936602.0,But what if you don't want help? Do they force it on you?
depression,facb9vw,t1_fabwndq,1575936449.0,"I'm in the same spot right now. I've been researching ways to end it all. Right now, I don't care about the mess or anything, just ending the pain. I have thought about who will find me and how this may affect them - that's the only thing stopping me right now. Hopefully, you can find some relief in knowing that none of us want you to die."
depression,f9gerzm,t3_e4wpyx,1575298156.0,"I feel your pain. It's been about a week and a half since I last washed, almost a week since I last brushed my teeth and sleep? What's that? I'm lucky if I get about 3 hours of sleep a night. The weird thing is I'm exhausted, why I can't sleep, I don't know."
depression,f9gctpp,t3_e4um83,1575297266.0,"I've given up trying to talk with anyone. I've called the helpline a few times and was constantly hung on up. When I did talk with someone, they made me feel so much worse."
