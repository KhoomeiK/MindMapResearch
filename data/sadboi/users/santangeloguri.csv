just started this 8 week self program (one week ago today) because the science behind it is compelling, and meds haven't worked to help my issues. 

In one week, just one week, the benefits of this practice (called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy by my therapist) are noticeable and real. For the first time in a very long time I have hope that my mind will not always trip out and I can eventually learn to control it. Neuroplasticity is an amazing thing."

It took time and was hard.  And lots of therapy and massage and acupuncture helped. 

You aren't who everyone you know tells you to be /raised you to be. You're you. Go somewhere that's always called you and meet yourself.  

What's the worst thing that could happen,  you might die trying? Everybody's gonna die anyway,  might as well die trying. I know it sounds simple and it kind of is, or at least was for me--after spending 6 or 7 years in frequent bouts of frantic misery daring the universe to kill me and I still wasn't dead, it just became less exhausting to try to not be miserable.

Anyway that was almost 20 years ago and I turned out to be a completely different and somewhat better person than I thought I was/was raised to be. Interesting stuff. 

The biggest measureable difference is over time I've become grateful for my life and wake up every day and choose to keep trying. 

Anyway, I hear you ."

awakened,ffyexf8,t3_evfkzv,1580344793.0," several years ago my father and I were having a talk about death as we had both lost several people close to us in the recent past. He had raised me in a more conservative offshoot of catholicism and I'm pretty sure he still defines his spiritual beliefs via that religion. my grandfather on my mother's side believed in reincarnation. that has left me with a very curious mix of spirituality and guilt seeking purpose. anyhoo at some point he asked me if i was afraid of death. 

i said ""absolutely not. i am afraid of not being good enough and dying an asshole so i have to come back here."" 

I guess this was the moment I realized that i believe in reincarnation/coming back and that is horrifying. In retrospect it was probably my guilt seeking purpose side that is 100 percent sure that i will never be a good enough person to tap out, graduate, win, what have you. I will always have to come back. to this prison.

years later i still don't feel much better about it. let me know if you guys figure it out."
