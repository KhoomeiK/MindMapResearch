I started in September and I was lucky enough to be hired as the studio assistant, so I was making money and able to maximize my time working, not commuting which was awesome. I also haven't had great enough savings in the job I had before to be able to pay full price for a wheel."
tea,fn02apx,t1_fn0202z,1586534145.0,"I was fortunate enough to take a risk, leave my job and start throwing full time. I was at the studio from 10-10 every day practicing. I am love, for sure! I have never worked this hard at something and it feels good. I would watch videos of people throwing online. Really study what they are doing either the clay, hands, etc. It put me miles ahead."
Ceramics,fmzw6kb,t3_ftdy9s,1586530776.0,Has anyone here ever hooked up an at home kiln? I bought a skutt 1027 of CL for $400 that has dials.

 I guess I am still confused about how these types of cups are made up. Is there a cool history to study? I just have used them when I was at certain tea stores and liked how using a smaller serving cup made me savor and appreciate the tea.

Ceramics,flsnqc7,t3_fqtnds,1585446378.0,"I am having a super hard time. I took a huge leap and quit my low paying job to go to community college to study ceramics. I was there every day for 12 hours. Just when I finally was making quality work everything got shut down. I lost my time to make my inventory and the money it cost me to have access to the studio. I was hired as a studio assistant and I lost my only income. I was throwing tiny chawan. 

I am not sure how to proceed, if I can’t make inventory right now. Thank you for posting to this. We have to come together and see how we can help each other when this is all over. Know that you are are not alone in this. Find me @succulentique if you’d like. I check that the most."

Now my money is going to waste because I don’t have access to the studio to make art work (ceramics). I am thankful for my health, my fiancé, my dogs, nature, sunshine, food and transportation.

Most of my friends that graduated with me in 2008 were finally feeling like they were making a little money and happy. Most are artists, performers, small business owners, consultant (gig and PT based workers). I believe, and I may be incorrect, but many individuals will not be eligible for unemployment benefits.

Those who make enough for traveling might not be, But I sure know if I had more economic opportunity in this state, I would be more than happy to travel. Traveling to me, is the biggest luxury one can have. If lines want to encourage unlikely travelers, they can always cut profit for a little while and offer cheaper tickets.
