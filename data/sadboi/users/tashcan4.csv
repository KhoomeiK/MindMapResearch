ptsd,fr39ag4,t3_gmc8wq,1589852552.0,"This may or may not help, but I know exactly how you feel and something small that worked for me when talking about my sexual trauma with my partner was to just have him hold me close, but so that we don’t make eye contact. I don’t know why but the shame/guilt is much stronger then I have to look at him as I say these things, this way you also don’t have to see their reactions to stuff beyond a comforting squeeze or two. I find I also often go nonverbal whenever having a face to face conversation and avoiding the eye contact can make it a bit easier to squeeze the words out. You can also set boundaries for those conversations. It will be different for you but for me, I like to specify for example: please don’t pity me or let me feel like you’re pitying me (makes it harder for me to tell him these difficult things if I feel too much like A victim in his eyes). These are really hard conversations to have though, and it’s an uphill battle, but one you can chip away at slowly with a few details here or there. Wishing you well"

I probably butchered the wording but I hope that makes some sense. Basically, as long as taking the substances isn’t having a negative impact on you,m and is helping to mitigate other troubling symptoms that affect you negatively, there is really no harm in continuing your use (in moderation)"

Get your head out of your ass, move your feet etc” but 0/10 recommend that. It’s awful, most days it probably would have been better for my mental health to give up and lie in bed.

He is moving across the country to live with me while I go to school, and as scary as that level of commitment is (especially in light of the abusive relationship) I’ve never felt so accepted. I found this man working at a garbage dump when I was at a very low point and it’s been constant, slow but steady progress since then.

What I try to do, is to tell myself that it’s ok if my memories aren’t 100% true to life, the mere fact that I’m re-experiencing them means that even if there are some inaccuracies, the feelings those memories evoke are still real and valid, and in that sense, they are true.

I know for me, even if it’s a past hobby that I haven’t done in years, when people talk about things you like/have a connection with it helps remind you that you’re not just a caricature of mental illness — you’re a person, with multifaceted interests and a personality. This is too easy to forget when you’re depressed, sometimes you might even feel inhuman. We often forget that we have ever been interested in anything, because our present state is so flat and devoid of meaning. This is a way to try and revive some of that meaning. Also, if she’s resistant to talking about stuff, maybe this sort of kind small talk is a better alternative than other topics."
