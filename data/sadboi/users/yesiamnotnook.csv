I know God is in control. No matter what, I will be ok as will you and your employees. Itâ€™s not ideal, but they will be taken care of. Times like these remind us, we are not in control. But we know the one who is and as long as we keep our eyes on him, we will have peace."

questions,fjfj7i9,t1_fjfiv38,1583292895.0,"I'm not sure why honestly. Google says: 

Depending onÂ yourÂ total availableÂ credit,Â closing a credit cardÂ account with a highÂ creditÂ limit could hurtÂ your credit score, particularlyÂ if youÂ have high balances on otherÂ cardsÂ or loans. ...Â If youÂ have zero balances,Â your creditÂ utilization rate is zero, and won't be impacted by the loss of a balance.

Another article says:
In general, it's best toÂ keep unused credit cardsÂ open so that you benefit fromÂ aÂ longer averageÂ creditÂ history andÂ aÂ larger amount of availableÂ credit.Â CreditÂ scoring models reward you for having long-standingÂ creditÂ accounts, and for using onlyÂ aÂ small portion of yourÂ creditÂ limit."

TooAfraidToAsk,fjbftyn,t3_fbovxv,1583192337.0,"Yes! I was 8 or 9. My family had just driven to Gatlinburg for the weekend. I remember that I was very excited to be there. I was sitting on toilet lol. And I thought I'm so happy to be here (not the toilet, but the hotel/city in general lol), I'll never forget this moment. I never have. 

I often have moments of happiness where I think, this is going to be just like that memory of Gatlinburg, I'm going to remember it forever, but then I never remember those moments. I just remember that I thought i would have another moment, but dont recall what the moment was lol. 

I also have other moments that stick with me, some good, some bad. I remember laughing hysterically with a high school crush bc we had driven out to a dock, and I didnt have glasses on. I told him to follow the signs bc I saw something about their being ducks that way. While telling the story, it doesnt seem funny but we laughed harder than ever over me thinking a sign was pointing us to ducks instead of a dock. It was just a moment of pure happiness.

The worst is seeing my grandmother when she was dying. She was in the back of the ambulance being shocked. I remember seeing her body shake or convulse maybe as she was being shocked. It's so vivid, it's like it happened last night in my head, even though it was about 20 years ago now."
