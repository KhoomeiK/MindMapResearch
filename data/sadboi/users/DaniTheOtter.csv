Seeing Number Lad 5 near Jack's time bubble really got my heart rate going. I know he's got no means of freeing Jack but still. Just the thought of that maybe potentially hypothetically happening scares me.

Seeing #5 and Sveta together is so wholesome. Tempted to ship them but things get real murky with cloning shenanigans.
