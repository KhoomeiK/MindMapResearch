My understanding of it is that once you stop smoking, you essentially have to learn to sing again.

livesound,fg30ap5,t1_fg2xqo8,1580464230.0,"My reason for asking is that I'm the singer in a band and it's become my task of EQ'ing the rest of the band, and my vocals included. So say for instance I'm working on the bass, and I notice that there is a valley in the frequencies on the real time analyser, would boosting that valley to level it out create a better sound?
I imagine that it probably wouldn't, and I think my basic understanding of how frequencies work is completely off. Am I right in thinking that there naturally should be peaks and troughs on certain notes, as that note is made up of a couple of different frequencies? So me boosting a 'valley' doesn't get the desired effect?
Apologies if that sounds ridiculous but I'm just struggling to get my head around what it is about certain frequencies that gives it the desired effect. I understand the premise of using your ears to mix it to a point of it sounding nice, but I'm trying to understand, why does boosting that certain area sound better than boosting a frequency just slight higher or lower?

I'm also mainly trying to work out how it is that you would remove 'muddiness' from an instrument or sibilance from a vocal mic. Currently our biggest issues are balancing the Bass guitar so that it doesn't become a rumble that gets lost in the mix, and getting my vocal mic to not sound thin and tinny. The problem with what I'm trying to do with mic is that if I try to get rid of the tinniness by adding some bottom then it becomes muddy and I don't know what to do to fix either.

My current train of thought is thinking of the overall frequencies as a 'space' and I should be aiming to set each instrument into it's own slot within that space. So for instance, try to get a kick drum down around 80hz where it's a 'feel' and then mix the bass just above that. Then try to give the vocals and guitars their own space above that so that they don't overlap each other too much and get lost.
Is that the correct train of thought or am I way off?

Sorry for the wall of text, but I do really appreciate your help."

I have been working on the basis that anything that is low on the spectrograph you would boost, and anything that is in the +db section you would cut, but is that correct?   
I just watched a video that said ""EQ can't fix what isn't there"" and I thought what a idiot I am. I'm trying to boost frequencies where there is 0 coming through.  


So my question is really, at what point do I start cutting things, and where and how much should I boost? What is the aim of boosting and cutting? Are you aiming to get the frequency to settle equally at around 0db across the board?"

livesound,ffw9eo4,t3_eunmbe,1580290826.0,"I'm having some sound issues in my band and would appreciate some advice on what things to research to improve my knowledge.  
We've got what I'm told is excellent spec gear for a pub band. Behringer X32 digital desk, Nexo tops and bins and everything is being controlled through an android tablet.  


The task of sound checking has fallen on me as the singer. I've been in bands for many years but my experience of soundcheck has always been fairly simple. Just balancing the levels and never really had any issues with feedback. Now that we're using a lot more advanced tech to what I'm used to, I'm finding that we seem to constantly have sound issues.  


I'm using a Shure wireless mic and I'm finding that for some reason it's picking up a lot of feedback from on stage. If I sound check out front I can get a good sound, then as soon as I stand on stage, well behind the speakers, I'm picking up a huge amount of feedback and we're having to mess around with the EQ to try and calm it. But then that seems to be sacrificing some clarity on the mic. I'm feeling as though we're using much better quality gear, but it's making things unnecessarily difficult, and I don't really have the knowledge to fix it. I EQ'd the backing mics identically to my initial EQ levels and the sound was great. No feedback at all. Then when I went and stood next to them, my mic was feeding back but theirs was not. Even though the gain levels and volume were supposedly set to the same level.

I'm also feeling that the bass guitar sound is extremely 'muddy'. Our bassist is using a DI box and an active bass, and I can't seem to get any brightness out of the bass at all. I'm not sure if the bass drum is perhaps bleeding into that sound? It always seems as though you're just feeling the bass notes, instead of being able to pick up any clarity through the mix. Is there a  'standard' EQ for mixing live bass?

There also seems to be a lot of 'hiss' from the bass channel. It's constantly hissing and our desk gate is cutting it out, but as soon as anything is played it's there again. I've tried everything I can think of to narrow down where it's coming from but can't seem to get rid of it at all.
