One of the accidents was a recent alumni who was racing down residential streets & hit a house. The other accident was horrible, it was right before we started our senior year. He was a football player, super popular, smart, an all american kid, he fell asleep driving home from a family trip to see his sister in college. He & his other sister were killed on impact but their parents survived. Senior year was very bittersweet for everyone. The school made sure to include him posthumously and his parents were honored at a couple of events. I worked in the office so I got to see a lot of them. His accident & death was the worst one for me. I lost a high school friend a few years after i graduated and that was devastating. I only found out months later and then come to find out it was so horrible & gruesome. He was hit by a train while walking on the tracks."

Now the mental health dept will you refer you to local counselors, therapists & clinics. Covered California should also be able to approve you too. They offer insurance to literally the working poor.
