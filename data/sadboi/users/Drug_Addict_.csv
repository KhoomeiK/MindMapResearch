i was super depressed not to long ago but found a girl, she is the only girl i'd ever want she's perfect, and shes the most beautiful thing in this world shes the only thing that makes me happy when i talk to her/see a picture of her. i love her with every ounce of love i have to give. shes the only reason i'm here commenting on this post.  we only know each other on social media because my friend introduced me to her, its still really early and i'm still only talking to her. shes seen pictures of me but they were in a way you cant tell i'm ugly. when i say ugly i mean ***super*** fuckin' ugly. i'm afraid when when we meet in person shes gunna hate me, that is if i even get that far with her. I know for a fact that when/if i lose her (hopefully never, i want to be with her till the end of time) that the pain will be unbearable and if i'm not able to get her back i will just kill myself. if i have a gun at the moment i lose her i will strait up blow my brains out wherever i stand. i'm serious about this, i wouldn't give a shit about where i am i would shoot myself in front of a kids birthday party. at this point you probably think i'm insane, don't worry i think i am too. well if i don't have a gun, which i probably wont, i'll either find a train or i'm just going to find the highest place i know of and see if i can fly."
