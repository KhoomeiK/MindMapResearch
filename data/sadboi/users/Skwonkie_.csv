Now, to be fair, my son has a problem with social cues (part of his asd) so he’ll send 2-3 invites and messages the other kid to which we have put a stop to. All I’m saying is that as a father it’s heartbreaking seeing your kid cry because all he wants to do is play some video games with people he knows. I’m trying to teach him in his own way that sometimes people just don’t like one another, and that it’s not always their fault."
