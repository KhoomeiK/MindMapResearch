stopdrinking,fdf1p4p,t3_ejs6d7,1578351301.0,Day three is almost over!  Stayed busy enough today that I didn‚Äôt even think about it. Was nice waking up not feeling like I was slightly hung over and exhausted now bring in day four!!  IWNDWYT
stopdrinking,fdds1yr,t1_fdcmk1q,1578322500.0,Thank you for responding to my comment it means a lot to me!  Today will be day 3 and I‚Äôm going to continue going through it alcohol free.  IWNDWYT
stopdrinking,fdcdfyp,t3_ejs6d7,1578272206.0,Well as I sit here and think yes there is!  One great thing is I‚Äôm on call for work every weekend now until spring which will keep me away from booze on weekends and I‚Äôm not much of a weekday drinker!
stopdrinking,fd1z3q3,t3_ejs6d7,1578139070.0,Congrats to everyone who has quit alcohol!!  Was two days in and Friday comes along and BAM right back to day one todayüò°. I‚Äôm so tired of alcohol having such a hold on me!  I‚Äôm going to kick this nasty habit just like I quit smoking 17yrs ago!  So here I go but yet again IWNDWYT
stopdrinking,fbveat4,t3_eel73m,1577129569.0,"You did the right thing!!  I tried to avoid going to the work party last night but so many made me feel guilty about it I ended up going.  So today I‚Äôm suffering the consequences of going and drinking way too much, the exact reason I DIDN‚ÄôT want to go.  So now I‚Äôm depressed, anxious and exhausted and feel like an f‚Äôn looser.  I‚Äôm so dam angry at myself for giving in to the pressure of others!!  Be proud you bailed!  Merry Christmas to you!"
depressionmeme,f6w4z44,t3_dtclcc,1573216573.0,Don‚Äôt be angry it consumes too much valuable time.  Trying taking deep breaths and walking away from the situation.
stopdrinking,f4fdp1r,t1_f3wgote,1571569244.0,"Thank you for having confidence in me when sometimes I have zero in myself.  Work is coming to a close for the season so with that I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt have the urge to have that drink to unwind.  My plan is too keep busy outside as much as possible, take frequent naps, catch up on some TV and get to bed at normal times.  SD?  Sorry not sure what that is.  Thanks again for your words!"
stopdrinking,f4fcqqv,t1_f3vpofg,1571568958.0,I don‚Äôt drink every day but the problem is I KNOW I could AND I don‚Äôt know when to stop when I start.  One beer most always leads to at least 6.
stopdrinking,f4fbsrm,t1_f3ua6q6,1571568683.0,My why lately is I‚Äôve had a busy evening at work and I think I deserve a few drinks when I get home. Problem is a few turn into 6 and a 1am bed time. I wake up so tired and depressed I just wanna sleep the day away!  Thanks for your advice every bit helps!!  IWNDWYT
stopdrinking,f3u4m5q,t3_di6xif,1571152812.0,"I to am a reader of this sub the difference is I don‚Äôt have a success story to share.  I say every time after a night of drinking ‚ÄúI just want to quit, that‚Äôs it I‚Äôm quitting‚Äù!  Problem is a day or so passes and I‚Äôm back at it!!  So IWNDWYT and hopefully tomorrow and many days after!  Thanks for sharing your story I wish you all the best!"
DecidingToBeBetter,ewuku7a,t3_cporpa,1565784589.0,"I deleted Facebook 3 years ago, best thing I‚Äôve ever done for my mental stability.  However I now have Instagram only because it doesn‚Äôt have the same BS that FB has.  You get to pick and choose who and what you want to see.  So many people are are shocked when I say I do not have FB. My response is...‚ÄùBest thing I‚Äôve ever gotten rid of in my life‚Äù!  (Well aside from an ex of course hehe)"
depression,eunu40i,t3_cgujfp,1563933540.0,This is me in a nut shell.  I reached out to a couple of so called friends today and not one of them had time for me.  Funny how when they need something from me I‚Äôm always there.  So today I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll just handle whatever I have going on in my head on my own and those so called friends can piss off.  I‚Äôm am so sorry you are going through this it SUCKS!!  I hope you can see beyond today and know you are not alone in the struggle we call life!!
depression,etsz73r,t3_cd9p5b,1563159656.0,Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to talk to people who are feeling the same way you do and it‚Äôs free.  PM me anytime if you think it may help or anyone else on here I‚Äôm sure would be more than happy to chat with ya!  Don‚Äôt give up on life even if you don‚Äôt feel like it all the time people do care about you!
stopdrinking,etsy8zt,t3_cd04bl,1563158913.0,I‚Äôm on day 3!  You got this!!  IWNDWYT
stopdrinking,etsy6so,t3_cd86vz,1563158864.0,IWNDWYT either!  Enjoy you time with your children on Vacation making memories:)
stopdrinking,etsy2v3,t3_cd7417,1563158777.0,As you should feel proud!  Such a great feeling when you can hope in the car and run and errand without hesitation!  Congrats!  IWNDWYT
DecidingToBeBetter,etsxvvn,t3_cd4e9k,1563158620.0,"Well I have to say I‚Äôd love to put myself first but I can‚Äôt seem to get past the guilt when I try.  I‚Äôm married, have three children of my own and recently took a 16yr old girl and her then 5 month old baby.  (A decision I‚Äôm now regretting) There never seems to be enough time in a day, week or even a month to have ME time.  And if I do get time to myself all I want to do is nap or even just close my bedroom door and breath!  When I‚Äôm doing that I‚Äôm feeling guilty because I‚Äôm not spending more time with my family ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
depression,etsx704,t3_cd0hjp,1563158054.0,"This is my 18yr old son!  He quit school three months before graduating and his part time job last year because of his anxiety and depression.  He sat home all winter and complained because he didn‚Äôt have anything to do but couldn‚Äôt handle going back to school.  So he got a new job, seasonal work, bought a car and now says he hates the job and is so angry all the time because we force him to go because he has to pay for his car AND we don‚Äôt want him to fall into a deep depression and be takin over by anxiety again.  I know how he feels because I suffer from both myself but I want him to realize sometimes we just have to push ourselves.  I‚Äôm hoping as he gets older (24ish) he will learn to cope better.  Sorry for the long reply I just hope someone may have some advice that maybe I can use to help my boy!!"
depression,etswkkr,t3_cd6d58,1563157548.0,Oh heck ya!  Sometimes are way worse than others and I hate when it happens because it truly isn‚Äôt me.  I try push myself and fake it until I make it but the last couple of times I was to exhausted to fake it so I just warned everyone that I was not feeling myself and feeling VERY on edge so they could thread lightly around me.  lol.
Anxiety,etswc88,t1_etrput8,1563157362.0,"You need to find the right balance of CBD vs THC. I never touched the stuff even in my teen years because it made me paranoid but a friend of mine (that knows a LOT) showed me a strain high in CBD and very little (or no)TCH and it helps me with my anxiety so much. I only use it when I feel completely overwhelmed, which isn‚Äôt much. But it does help when nothing else does!!"
depression,et89xr6,t3_cacj1f,1562550624.0,"This is exactly how I‚Äôve been feeling lately!  I have everything that I need in my life right now so why am I feeling so much anger, depression and anxiety all the time!  Thank you for sharing how your feeling it helps me realize I‚Äôm not the only person feeling this way :-)"
stopdrinking,esgtcuv,t3_c7eaxd,1561965897.0,"There are times I think I am a problem drinker not because I drink every day, which I do not, but because I can rarely just stop at one drink.   I have to drink until the box is empty or I‚Äôm am slammed and just can‚Äôt drink anymore."
stopdrinking,esgt1c5,t3_c7eaxd,1561965456.0,So true!  It‚Äôs definitely all negatives for me for sure.  The day after drinking I feel so so guilty because I feel as though I missed out on time with family and friends I will never get back.
stopdrinking,esetxki,t1_eseryfq,1561909423.0,I need to chart a different course as well.  I hate how i miss out on memories with family on way too many Friday or Saturday nights! Thank you for sharing :)
stopdrinking,esetd6y,t1_eset9xz,1561909005.0,Christ let‚Äôs hope not!
stopdrinking,eseos23,t3_c7eaxd,1561905520.0,Again thank you for sharing!  Ya weed wouldn‚Äôt be an option for you FOR SURE!!  Ok you are certainly making me feel a little bit less guilty about my stupid one night bingers!  And you are so right about strewing about it only makes things worse. Thank you for your input it was very eye opening and helpful!!
stopdrinking,esen6kk,t3_c7eaxd,1561904270.0,I hat is soooo how I‚Äôm feeling!  And the guilt I feel should also be enough to make me quit!  I hank you for sharing!!  IWNDWYT
stopdrinking,esen3d9,t1_esemn2o,1561904198.0,Ya I get pretty bad depression and anxiety from drinking as well. Few days after however I seem to just forget about.  I should have someone remind me before I own that first can MAYBE that would help.  Thank you for sharing!! IWNDWYT
stopdrinking,esemx8p,t1_esemdyz,1561904058.0,Thank you for sharing. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking what are your alternatives?  Because weed is now legal in Canada I have been dabbling a bit in that and that helps.  It‚Äôs still weird however doing it because even though it‚Äôs legal not all people have accepted that yet as I‚Äôm sure you can imagine.
stopdrinking,esemnap,t3_c7eaxd,1561903833.0,I‚Äôm not an every day drinker I like to have Friday night drinks. The problem with that is if I open one beer you can pretty much bet I‚Äôm not gonna stop until I have drank until the case is empty or until I‚Äôm drunk to the point of forgetting some parts of the night.  Thank you for sharing your story with me.
stopdrinking,es37r9o,t3_c5exrh,1561555897.0,Thank you so much to that comment it shows me I‚Äôm not alone in this dam battle!!  I have such a love hate relationship with booze :(
stopdrinking,es302dc,t1_es24q0v,1561548872.0,As would I.   Makes me so sad and embarrassed to not remember what happened the day before!!  All I ever want is to quit but can‚Äôt seem to get past a week.  So tired of failing üò©
stopdrinking,es2zjt2,t3_c5kt59,1561548288.0,"Congrats!  Hopefully some day I‚Äôll get where you are.  So tired of trying and crashing posts like yours help me to continue trying.
