Especially the poor concentration part; I think that's why I was diagnosed originally, when I first saw a professional, with ADHD. I took Ritalin and it gave me hyperactivity worse than before, which I'm guessing were actually manic symptoms, but I will never know that without discussing with a psychiatrist, I suppose.

I've noticed a decline after psychotic episodes, but really, I'm not sure how much of a decline it has been for me since I've had these issues since childhood years for some of them. Alexithymia is only more recent for me.

I'd say it makes interpersonal communication all that more difficult, especially if one's conversational partner is not understanding of the lapses in response time or lack of clarity of thought presents itself.

I do DBT exercises for interpersonal communication, as well, I practice vocabulary, learning a language, reading, exercising, and taking free online courses on subjects in which I am weak (e.g., KhanAcademy). Still, there are clear limits to how successful or far it can go with some of them, e.g., poor working memory.

As to trigger, I haven't found one, except for possibly the aspect of highly emotional scenes, I tend to shut down.

Suffice it to say, I experience what you have, but I just don't rightly know what it is even called. The closest approximation that came to mind was dissociation, but even then, I feel that is inadequate to describe it.

I’ve heard of Human Centipede and I’ll admit I wanted to try it, but it sounded gross in an unhygienic way that I just was like, “Ew.” Didn’t know Hostel was “torture porn.” I haven’t watched the new AHS because I don’t like 70s/80s, but the others were okay.

I used to watch... hmm, what was it? I forget, LiveLeak, I think it was called. I also habitually watched horror movies, but it's not that I find them amusing like you. I had HI that fueled my interest in them, but never had I really watched ""torture porn"" type of horror movies.

Also, I can say I share the same issue of social cues regarding flirtation, but I'm better at detecting it. I think it was just lack of experience with me that I couldn't identify it easily. 

I don't think one necessarily has to be ""nerdy"" to be autistic, given it's a spectrum. Like, my sister is severely autistic and she isn't what one expects with regard to being ""nerdy."" I don't think she has such capacity for that, to be frank.
