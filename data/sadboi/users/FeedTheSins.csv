Vaping,f7g57ib,t1_f7g3u8m,1573694860.0,"Wow alot of information was learned in this article that's for sure. 
2000 reports were called in and 40 deaths documented in the last week.  
Not to mention 60% out of 100 voted that vaping should be illegal. 
After your comment I stated looking and researching the political view on vaping and it seems like the new law passed and the legal age is official now 21 rather than 18. 

However this part is more of my personal opinion but I feel like everything dwells on the person who chooses to vape in the first place. There are warning labels on the packaging for a reason. I smoke and I know what's at risk. What I hate more than anything is when people tell me how dangerous it is. As if I don't already know that already. Now if vaping days are indeed  numbered then I believe that's an issue and honestly very stupid. For vaping is less harmful than cigarettes. Will my thoughts go far absolutely not."

Now obviously this is more of a personal question but nothing tramatic happened to your family recently right?
