prolife,fqblker,t1_fqbhx7x,1589239261.0,I feel like they are taught to sell abortions. It‚Äôs so sad. Women should be able to go in there with no expectations of an abortion. They deserve to get the help they need
prolife,fqblchh,t1_fqbf4mn,1589239141.0,Thank you so much for responding with this information!
prolife,fqbl8ov,t1_fqbi912,1589239085.0,I just watched it this weekend!
prolife,fqaxywj,t1_fq4t7s9,1589227208.0,Why does planned parenthood claim to do all these other things but is labeled as an abortion clinic on google? And on their website the first thing I see is ‚Äúabortion clinic near you‚Äù and a map of all the clinics in the US. I really thought they offer abortion as a last resort. But I feel like that‚Äôs what they are promoting.
relationship_advice,fq6dewr,t3_gh3npu,1589129370.0,Nope
mentalillness,fq68cg9,t1_fq65lfq,1589126538.0,Yes it‚Äôs completely up to you!
mentalillness,fq64xuc,t3_gh3f6c,1589124579.0,Only if you‚Äôve signed a waiver that allows them to communicate!
prolife,fq5q8kx,t1_fq4t1lx,1589114391.0,Thank you so much! I appreciate you taking time to comment! It means a lot!
prolife,fq4oqg7,t1_fq4a8wu,1589080670.0,Thank you so much for your reply! I will let you know if I think of any more!!
prolife,fq4olgm,t1_fq4k8ar,1589080581.0,"I think knowing the process of an abortion and the lies that are told that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just matter‚Äù and ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt feel it‚Äù is ridiculous. But I also don‚Äôt feel like women shouldn‚Äôt be shamed. My mom is a L&D nurse and has always been very pro life. I know different people with different views. I don‚Äôt judge someone if they don‚Äôt believe in the same things as me. But I do judge them if they don‚Äôt even want to hear the other sides thoughts and feelings. I‚Äôve always been open to both sides. I am from the south though. I see your view and respect it. Does Pro-life believe in no abortions at all, or do they accept the three situations above? Or does it just depend on the person? I‚Äôve always seen myself as pro-choice because of the situations with incest, rape, and medical issues."
prolife,fq4jog6,t1_fq4h9no,1589078620.0,I don‚Äôt understand either. I just don‚Äôt see her working there for 8 years and then all of a sudden makes up a bunch of stuff. She was already the clinic director. Something had to upset her enough to quit. And then PP was like oh man she knows what happens behind closed door. Or she wouldn‚Äôt have been sued. They are hiding something and I never even thought to question them but neither did she and she worked there.
prolife,fq4eoq9,t1_fq4dn52,1589076826.0,"I‚Äôve only ever been pro-choice for those reasons. I think if you have sex and you don‚Äôt take the necessary precautions, even if you do there is still that risk. I believe that in the end you need to take responsibility for those actions and own up to it and fulfill the pregnancy. But in the end that person gets to decide. Even though I personally wouldn‚Äôt do it."
prolife,fq4chcz,t1_fq3urh9,1589076021.0,"I‚Äôm getting DMs that Abby lies, why would she though? Thoughts on this?"
prolife,fq4c3rk,t1_fq47ssm,1589075886.0,Did Abby lie at all or is there anything to back it up?
prolife,fq40gt4,t1_fq3urh9,1589072346.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to respond! I have a feeling this sub will help me learn a lot and become more aware!
prolife,fq3xxob,t1_fq3p832,1589071563.0,"1. Does Planned Parenthood really push abortions. I was always told that was their last option. 

2. Do they really hide it when procedures go wrong?

3. Are Saturday‚Äôs still for abortions?

4. How far along do they have to be to have abortion not be an option?"
prolife,fq3utkf,t1_fq3unjm,1589070541.0,Thank you so much. I‚Äôm going to do a research paper on this because I feel so unaware :/

Advice,fpicna0,t1_fpibr8c,1588638176.0,I see what you‚Äôre saying. I think reading out loud would give it more life. Rather than a ton of people skimming through the post. So they know someone actually cares. Because you can type one thing but believe something completely different. If that make sense! Reading the post would be a genuine reaction each time
Advice,fpicbqs,t3_gdjgfk,1588637989.0,In the end it‚Äôs going to be her word against yours when it comes to the cops. I‚Äôve been there. My roommate would get beat quite often. And he would leave pissed and I would lock the door and then she would let him back in. This is a very hard cycle to break. I‚Äôve been there myself. She has to want help. Nothing you do or say is going to change how she feels. I know it‚Äôs frustrating but I promise you she will always pick him. That is until something really bad happens and she gets a major wake up call. It took my dad crying begging me to breakup with my ex to realize there was a real issue. I had never seen him cry before that and both of his parents passed away in his late twenties. So I got lucky that I didn‚Äôt end up dead or severely hurt. Abusive relationships are hard and you don‚Äôt see how bad they really were until you‚Äôre out of it.
relationship_advice,fpibteb,t3_gdiewe,1588637692.0,Ummmm so you‚Äôre telling me you bled on the bed on accident and he‚Äôs being that big of a dick. Love you should be pissed at him for acting that way. Not the other way around. You did nothing wrong at all. It was an absolute accident and don‚Äôt think otherwise for a minute. He sounds extremely selfish and I think this should be a major red flag for you! Let me know if you need anything!
rape,fphpmly,t1_fphnle6,1588625488.0,Of course! You got this!
mentalillness,fphp0rg,t3_gdgzio,1588625173.0,I constantly forget the basics. And it makes me so upset. Especially when I can‚Äôt remember where I put my keys or if I locked my car and only 30 seconds has passed. This is definitely something that can happen because of trauma or a past eat disorder. I‚Äôm talking to my psychiatrist about it because there is no way I can get good grades if I can‚Äôt remember what was on the notecard I already read 50 times. I understand how you feel. I would definitely talk to your therapist about it and then see what they say and bring it up to your psychiatrist!
rape,fphmlkx,t3_gdia0u,1588623943.0,I was drugged and don‚Äôt remember a lot. But I have nightmares every night as well and it‚Äôs like I remember it vividly. It‚Äôs terrifying and upsetting but I believe I‚Äôm remembering what happened to me from the very back of my mind. I‚Äôve had night sweats and nightmares for the past two years nightly. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve had to go through this. But I definitely believe you‚Äôre remembering things 1. You don‚Äôt want to 2. To protect yourself. Our bodies are really amazing on how much they wants to protect us!
rape,fphm6w3,t3_gdfyd3,1588623733.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you :( the sooner you tell a trusted adult the better. I know it‚Äôs going to be easier said than done. But maybe you could write a note to your parents so you don‚Äôt have to say anything in person. But this creep needs to be punished and kicked out. The cops need to know, this is always how I thought about it. If I report it I can save girls in the future from this happening to them. And I would also question if you were the first. It‚Äôs so hard to come out and say what happened. But this could happen again to you or someone else. Happy Birthday btw love! It gets better. Being vulnerable and upset is not a bad thing. You have every right to be mad, sad, etc. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help!"
mentalillness,fpdlpht,t3_gcszpe,1588529463.0,It happens to me a lot. I‚Äôm not angry person at all but sometimes I randomly snap :/ then feel guilty afterwards and ashamed.
