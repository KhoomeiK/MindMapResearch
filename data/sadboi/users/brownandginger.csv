Anxiety,fdq72zy,t3_ej29di,1578657663.0,"This may have already been said, but have you considered starting your own business? I started mine with £75 whilst working full time until it made enough money to sustain me without another job (it took six months).

When you love what you do it no longer feels like work, though it’s not all sunshine and roses it’s so much better than lining someone else’s pockets whilst you are miserable.

Hope you find the right solution for you x"
