offmychest,fptblk6,t3_gfdm2w,1588888283.0,"My days of aspiring for more than a bachelor’s degree are over but I will never forget a gen ed world history class I had to take. We had to come up with a thesis and write a cohesive paper after reading The Prince, The Canterbury Tales, and Gilgamesh, and one other book. I assumed a leadership role and appointed a book to each group member. From our first meeting, it became clear that these no-load losers had no intentions of reading any of their book. I had no intention of failing a history class because I am and was a perfectionist and more importantly had no hope of acceptance into the school of nursing if my GPA was less than 3.4 (they only had 200 slots and it was a highly competitive program). I proceeded to read every damn book. I also wrote the entire paper. Their submitted contributions were appalling. Simple spelling and grammar errors. I pretty much gave up and we ended up with a C+ on the paper. It was 60% of our grade. I think I need up with an A-. Funny enough, my lowest grade in college was in Geography, an elective I chose that I assumed would be easy. Anyway, not comparing my experience to yours, being that mine was 20 years ago and for a stupid gen ed undergrad class- but I think I might understand a fraction of your pain. Good luck. Also, I tried to explain to my professor that the paper wasn’t going well and he was a pompous jerk who stated that in the “real world” of employment I would need to learn to work with all types. I mean, unfortunately he was right. However, it’s a hard pill to swallow when you are looking at a mountain of student loans and need a good grade to make those loans worthwhile."

personaltraining,fp5vy1e,t1_fp5s08n,1588341085.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. I appreciate it. I applaud you for pursuing nursing; nursing school is difficult! To be honest I was feeling burned out prior to COVID. The abuse we endure from patients, doctors, and management is at an all time high. I have worked ortho, progressive care, Med/Surg, surgical, and even a doctor’s office. I have been a nurse since graduating with my BSN at 22. If I were younger and without children, I would pursue my NP. However, at this point, I’m just emotionally and even spiritually drained. I keep thinking I’m going to give up nursing, but not sure I ever will because I do, without question, have a passion for people, and caring for people at their most vulnerable. I don’t know. What do you think of getting the certification and dipping my feet into personal training without entirely giving up my career in nursing?"

relationship_advice,fnrwlk9,t3_g3ky1a,1587204385.0,"I am going to be honest here, if my husband confessed this I’d be out of there so fast...that would be very scary for the mother of a daughter to grasp or understand. 

However, this is something you need to bring to a therapist. I am not a therapist, but I do know what it’s like to experience intrusive, disturbing thoughts. I think it’s normal for your mind to take you to forbidden areas- we are all human. What’s not normal is for these thoughts to consume you. It can become a cycle of torment; The more you freak out about and pay attention to the thoughts, the more these thoughts pop into your head. I’m describing the obsession part of diagnosed obsessive compulsive behavior. Perhaps research this and see if it fits what you are going through.

Again, I emphasize the necessity of seeking professional help. Your daughter deserves a normal relationship with her dad. And if these really are intrusive, obsessive thoughts that you would never act on, you deserve freedom from the self torture.

With all sincerity, good luck."

rant,fngvnt6,t1_fnfhiuu,1586946682.0,"Yeah I think I agree it was probably just a slight. Along the same vein, a lot of nurses I work with want hazard pay. That sounds amazing, but when I think about it, why shouldn’t everyone else get hazard pay too (not arguing the practicality of it, I’m no economist). So if we give hazard pay to nurses and doctors, we should give to all essential workers exposing themselves to the public, and essentially potential infection. I hate the “but I’m more essential” or “I do this so therefore I deserve this..” It’s hard, and I admit I’ve had some personal lows and feeling of angers or self-righteousness (for which I’m not proud) but I’m trying to maintain the attitude that I’m ultimately part of the solution and taking personal pride in that, is enough. Everyone who has done their part, from following social distancing guidelines to working in the COVID units deserves to feel pride in the sacrifices they have made. Okay I’m done."
rant,fngv2i7,t3_g1gd4j,1586946049.0,"Yeah that’s complete bullshit. I’m a nurse and it is rare that I go one shift without consulting our in house pharmacist or pharmacy tech. Pharmacists are the ultimate gatekeepers between the doctors ordering the drugs and the nurse dispensing the drugs. Sure, doctors make the decision on what drug the feel is necessary to treat the condition, and nurses are responsible for properly dispensing the drug to the patient and making sure all parameters are met to safely dispense the meds, but pharmacists have a vital role as well. Your chain is doctor—->pharmacist—->nurse——>patient. If you don’t have a pharmacist there verifying that prescribed medication is appropriate dose, appropriate medication even (doctors consult pharmacists on which medications in class of meds would be most effective), appropriate in terms of potential side effects or patients drug allergies, etc., it’s only a matter of time before a patient dies. And guess what, if there is a failure in that pharmacy link in the chain- and that med gets dispensed and a patient dies, the doctor and nurse better find themselves a good lawyer. I am very thankful for the amazing pharmacists I work with. They are way more educated than I am and both nurses and doctors heavily trust and rely on them to make sure meds are distributed safely and effectively. Many thanks to your wife."

They should educate themselves on how to use properly. I am mad at our government’s lack of preparation for a pandemic such as this. Also mad that the idea of what constitutes as adequate protection when caring for a covid patient seems to change. Previously, with patients who had the flu and required droplet precautions, you used a new surgical mask (not n95) with every encounter. Apparently not only is an n95 not needed for a covid patient, but 1-2 surgical masks per 12 hour shift is supposed to suffice. I could go on... but I am on my day off and trying to chill."

I don’t know how much of her profits she donates to the cause or if her facilities are legit. I don’t possess all the facts and am not qualified to make that determination. I also don’t know what portion of her lifestyle is financed by the money she made/inherited from her ex-husband. Don’t get me wrong, I’m honestly not a fan of any of these Tiger King main players. They seem very egotistical and power hungry at a minimum.

Edited to clarify: If all criteria is met and a person is running an ethical wildlife sanctuary that contributes to the cause of wildlife conservation and education, I don’t care of their profit is $30,000/year or $3,000,000.

For some, high school is their hey day- but that is pretty sad if you think about it. Who wants high school to be the best 4 years of their life? The prom queens looks will fade, the star quarterback will inevitably get a dad bod, and the popular crowd has quite a few that will succumb to alcohol or the psychological repercussions of doing hard drugs while their brain is not fully developed. Heck, the valedictorian of my school dropped out from a full ride at a prestigious university for drug addiction. The quiet nobody with average grades and no social life became a successful doctor. I could tell you many more of these true stories... they aren’t just anecdotes. I am 37- but have had ocd, anxiety, and depression since age 9.

I never know if shaking hands with another woman is culturally appropriate, but when I do think it’s called for.... a woman’s weak grip makes me think either she has no confidence, finds me lacking as an equal in looks or intelligence, or thinks I’m weird for initiating a hand shake. A strong grip from another woman is like- yes girl, let’s be friends. (For the record, I am a firm, assertive, yet not dominating hand shaker when it comes to either sex). Same for hugs- I love a genuine, full embrace with an extra squeeze from a woman- shows you love or genuinely care for me and are happy I’m there. A strong, close hug from anyone other than my husband or dad is creepy. At the same time, the awkward side hug from a male where you don’t know where to put your arms is equally creepy-just don’t initiate a hug if you’re feeling uncomfortable about it- then a firm handshake, closed by your other hand is enough to express your happiness to see me and that I am well.

Convenient foods are not the healthiest. Additionally, foods are engineered to be highly palatable and are laden with sugar, salt and fat. These foods have been shown to be addictive, and food addiction, while evident by our waistlines, is highly acceptable and easily hidden (what you eat in public is not necessarily what you eat in private). These are just some reasons why our society is trending towards obesity. I’m the first to admit that I have all kinds of healthy foods at home, but dinner time comes around and I’m like.... ugh I don’t want grilled chicken and vegetables and feel nauseous just thinking about eating it. I’ll go get something I find more tasty. (I’ve been known to eat a whole family size container of Oreos in a sugar binge-and while this is objectively unhealthy, I maintain a BMI of 19). Maybe if I really knew what true hunger was like (most of us have no idea), I wouldn’t snub my nose at a nutritious meal.

Edited to add: Interesting side note, I have been recently buying size 0 pants.

As a teenager, early 20’s you sometimes cave to the pressure. I get angry thinking about a “date” I went on where the guy would not stop harassing me. I don’t have a son, but if I did, I would teach him that if a woman gives consent after you ask her 10 times, then it’s not consent."
unpopularopinion,fiawp9f,t1_fiafx7j,1582309895.0,"This is the kind of response that shapes my distaste for sex. Like its necessary in order to live a happy life. Boring. It’s great to have compatible sex drives, but stellar sex doesn’t float a relationship. Lack of intimacy, on the other hand, I believe is a resonable excuse for straying."
unpopularopinion,fiavi6g,t3_f7cuyb,1582309202.0,"You’re not alone. I definitely relate and I am so glad you expressed what you feel- I don’t feel so alone. The emphasis on sex and sexuality that permeates our society disgusts me. More than ever, it’s shoved in a woman’s face that her value is based on how sexually desirable she is. As a nurse, I constantly have men patients say things like “I have the prettiest nurse”, “crawl into bed with me”...etc. I have had a boss smack my ass. I have been honked at while out running. I was in situations in college where men were relentless in their pursuit of sex (not relationships). I’m not a man-hater, prude, or militant feminist. I’m a heterosexual woman who is turned off by men acting like sex crazed/addicted animals and women who feel pressured to cater to them. Then I think about the prevalence of child pornography, sexual trafficking, sexual harassment/rape, etc. I don’t know, I guess bottom line, while I recognize sex as a biological necessity and a source of pleasure, at this point in my life, sex is a very low priority and I am both bored and repulsed by those that seem to be controlled by their sexuality and sexual urges."

Am a married woman but that’s all I looked for. Personality over looks always. Good looks don’t get you through the hard times. I think most women would agree with that. Attraction is important, but come on, life is not a filtered photo on Instagram. Good luck, and don’t sell yourself short!"

AskReddit,fh7qjpb,t3_f1pnzp,1581341914.0,"There is nothing wrong with feeling important. I believe everyone is placed on Earth for a purpose. Every action is a catalyst to a bigger chain of events. The key is being open minded about what that “purpose” is and realizing that each moment creates an opportunity to find new purpose. Some of us are destined to be the Martin Luther Kings of the world and some of us are still searching for those moments to make humanity a little bit better, whether through acts of kindness, charitable donations, contribution to the arts,etc."

I look like the little Dutch boy without the bangs. I can’t put in a ponytail when I work out. I hate my hair- I sympathize in every way. Then people feel like they have to acknowledge the change and they always say, “i like your hair”. It’s completely obligatory.
