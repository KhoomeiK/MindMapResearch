EDH,f6ii3ht,t3_drhscl,1572878891.0,"I love coin flips and have this as a combo deck. Unfortunately you cannot copy Krark's Thumb unless the copies are not legendary or you have [[Hall of Mirrors]]. Unfortunately I can't access the deck as my data is spotty, but definitely want to see it when I get home today. Deck sounds interesting. 

Also if you don't have it I'd suggest [[Chance Encounter]] comboing with [[Frenetic Efreet]]. It's an instant win if you have Encounter on the board and you get Efreet to stick."

What I will say is that one way to think of things is life goes on. Although we may be stuck in the past , but life continues to move forward. Trust me when I say you don't want it to leave you behind. It's not a place you want to be. I've tried doing everything to keep moving forward and even though it's still tough I've been able to just take everything one day at a time. You've got this. You can get through this. Trust me. If I can keep moving forward I'm sure you can too!

TrueOffMyChest,f03y7mt,t1_f03pi5d,1568374416.0,"That's where a cover letter comes in handy. Most all job applications will allow a cover letter of some sort. This gives you the ability to convey information without needing to put it on a resume. The cover letter is your chance to convince the recruiter/HR that you are the person they want. 



A common misconception is that both the cover letter and the resume is a one size fits all. Also be sure that as you apply to new positions you adjust your resume accordingly. Whether it's changing the goal part, adjusting the language in responsibilities from job experiences, or using the verbage from the job posting in your resume/cover letter. A lot of places look for buzzwords and if you can utilize those it'll be easier to get the interview."

ModernMagic,f037mp2,t3_d3gaz5,1568347046.0,"I played Blistercoil Combo for a few months. It was a lot of fun, but glass Canon doesn't even describe it accurately enough. The deck ran 4 Blistercoil, 4 Paradise Mantle, 2 Serum Powder, 2 Grapeshot, 4 manamorphose, and 8 lands (yes you read that right. 8 lands). Plus all the 1 Mana cantrips you can pack. The deck was super inconsistent and died heavily to removal. I even had [[disrupting shoal]] and [[noxious revival]] in the side just in case. Even when I got going I never knew if I would win because if I drew into land it kind of ended the combo. I don't think Song is good enough to make it viable as it ends up being a roadblock when you start drawing. The deck really just needs another creature that does something similar in order to be more consistent. 




Dont get me wrong I love this deck, but I don't think it has enough pieces to be good at the moment."

It's all about how you can explain it in the resume. For me I stated that I had opportunities elsewhere or tried doing my own business. Usually they just ask what in and leave it at that. I was also fortunate that my father is a tradesman and i was able to work with him a bit. So I could say I was helping him. I've found out that as long as you can explain the periods you didn't work with something tangible they won't look too into it.

What does it matter what someone else enjoys? You say you're straight, but history (your previous Reddit posts) tell us a different story. It's ok not to be straight, but at least accept it in yourself.

ModernMagic,exj22jr,t3_csymqp,1566340309.0,"I usually play Grixis Control and it can be tough depending on their start.



Game 1: I'm not bad as I have Nihil Spellbomb to deal with Raven's Crime and K. Command for the Rack. Cryptic Command can also act as removal for any enchantments that may come. If I can get to turn 4 my odds get better at winning most of the time. 



Games 2 & 3: I have E.E. in the side as well as Surgicals. Side out Remands for CounterSqualls. I may bring in Vandalblast if I think it's absolutely necessary. 



My first 2-3 turns are slow and game 1 I have a lot of creature removal that can be dead in the hand. Those turns are your opening to get in before I get Mana up for the real control plays like Cryptic Command or Torrential Gearhulk."

Also I'd add [[Frenetic Efreet]] to combo with Chance Encounter. If it resolves you win the game on the spot essentially."

ModernMagic,eqsfbar,t1_eqse9hm,1560283592.0,"It's actually not too bad. Because you have to wait a turn for Blistercoil to be online when you untap you essentially have 2 Mana. I figured Shoal and Negation would be side. They're a double edge sword unfortunately. They're really good when you have them, but absolutely awful when going off. 


As far as lands go you might actually want to look into the Canopy lands from Horizons. I think they are a good fit. But the lower you can go on the land count the better I found. Too many times have I found that it does matter in the game how many you run."
ModernMagic,eqsc6ao,t3_bzgeit,1560281546.0,"So before I start I ran this deck for a few weeks and did a lot of testing with friends. I really love this deck.



What I found through playing it is even with protection spells it is still quite hard to pull off. With all sorts of removal in the format you're almost better off trying [[Disrupting Shoal]] instead of Noxious Revival, but even then it feels bad drawing into it when you're trying to go off.


The other card you want to consider is [[Manamorphose]] as it gains you Mana and draws. Plus it helps with casting Faithless Looting flashback. Trust me it is more relevant than you would think. 


Lastly once your opponent knows what's going on it's hard to win games. I usually would get game 1, but proceed to lose games 2 and 3. You need this deck to win Turn 2 or at turn 3 at the latest. If it goes much longer it can be miserable. 



As far as lands Fetchlands are your best friends in this deck. I actually ran a total of 8 lands doing a 50/50 split between fetches and fetchable lands. 



Like I said I love this deck and would love to see it do well, but with loads of removal and the risk of running so few lands it's a really tough sell. If you have any other questions just ask! I hope this helped!"

My boss and the owner of the company were looking for businesses to do sponsorships with. They got a hold of one of the major phone companies and even set a meeting with the executives. Well they go into the meeting and everything seemed ok. The phone company stated that because of the time of year they did not have the budget to spend, but were very excited about the opportunity to work with us. They gave out their direct contact information and said to circle back next year when they set the budget. Perfectly reasonable explanation.


Well I guess our owner didn't like that and sent an email to my boss about how they definitely have the money and that the contact person was an idiot and a bitch... Well what he didn't know is that he replied all to the email and it was sent to the person they were talking about. She then replied stating ""I see how thing work there. We will not be supporting a business that views us like that"" and copied every executive. Needless to say we were blacklisted."

https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/15-05-19-gwendlyn-edh/

When I first built it I kept it at a lower cost and just focused on discard. But with WAR and taking apart a modern deck I had around, it added to the value. 

What's nice about her is that she isn't a kill on sight Commander and everyone initially looks at her ability as under powered. Unfortunately my play group has caught on. Once I have a walker or two out with her they gang up on me."
