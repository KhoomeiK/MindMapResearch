PublicFreakout,f4oda7g,t3_dkvrce,1571699756.0,"For all the people saying she had plenty of space the move up, it looks like she had maybe 6-7ft tops. Even if there is the full 10ft some people are claiming, there isn't enough room for him to order if she does pull up, cause she's still right in front of the menu. The average length of a car is 14ft. Take off 4ft for the hood and all 3 cars would still have to be touching bumper to bumper for him to have a chance of yelling his order at the poor employee working drive thru."

We're both open to poly relationships, but I guess he just doesn't see me as a match. Best case scenario is that he's as afraid of ruining our friendship as I am"
unrequited_love,f489h59,t1_f47piab,1571434686.0,I expressed that within the past month (he's aware of my feelings) and we started talking normally again after a few days

unrequited_love,f0ae3o9,t1_f0a8r4h,1568513656.0,"It's almost reassuring to see how many people must deal with the same thing. I think it's having to bottle it up all the time is what really makes it so hard to deal with. I try to talk to most people and they tell me to ""go for it"", but I know how it'll end because I've already tried :/
I'm glad I found a community that can understand what it's like"

Advice,f05y3tn,t1_f05ae0p,1568423170.0,"Unfortunately I recently let him know about my lingering feelings in the sense of expressing that I might need space for a while, and while he was incredibly understanding, it's apparent that he does not reciprocate my feelings for him :/ We still talk and hang out like everything is normal now and it's only been a week since I brought it up. He's not in a relationship, but I get the feeling I'm just not his type. Heck, he even invited me out to lunch with him today. If there was a chance of him liking me back, wouldn't he have said something? 
Besides, I've been in the mindset since the break up of not wanting to be romantically involved with anyone so I can learn to be happy being by myself. On the other hand, if throwing myself back into dating will make it easier I'm willing to try almost anything."
Advice,f05xdnj,t1_f0598ve,1568422541.0,"I'm aware that my feelings and actions are greatly jeopardizing our relationship. I'm surprised he stuck with me for as long as he has. If I knew how to move past it I wouldn't be posting here. 
I also recognize that I am much more emotionally reliant on him than I care to admit, which I am currently working with a therapist to help deal with - among other things."
