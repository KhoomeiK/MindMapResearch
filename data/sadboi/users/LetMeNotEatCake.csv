EatingDisorders,fo8qjeh,t1_fo8o0ew,1587601786.0,"OA HOW I believe is the one the restricts bread and sugar, not plain OA. But nonetheless, I don't work the OA program but I still find attending meetings very helpful. So I agree, there are a lot of things about OA I don't agree with (including thinking their way is the ""only way"" to recovery). You have to try different stuff and see what works for you personally."
FoodAddiction,fo8d77s,t3_g5egdp,1587594323.0,"I guess I see my issues with food more as a mental problem at its core rather than a physical problem. I don't think any one diet is going to make things better for me. Any time I start a new diet, I do okay for a while, and then it's right back to the same old, same old. If you have obsessive thoughts about food, they aren't going to go away just because your obsessive thoughts are now about meat and fats rather than sweets. And even if you do lose weight, your addictive thoughts are still not going to go away. Just my 2 cents."

BingeEatingDisorder,fo7rrf7,t3_g5zqxb,1587583421.0,"I'm starting my recovery, I'm not a doctor, so take my *opinion* with a grain of salt but....I feel like a lot of people treat recovery like, ""Oh, I am recovered now, I never have to think or worry about it again."" I am not so sure that's how it works. Can you imagine if any other type of addict like an alcoholic or drug addict talked like this? Recovery isn't a one-time event that happens and you're magically cured. It's an on-going process, probably for life. Maybe it gets easier? I don't know. I hope it does. But I don't think we ever get to stop working on ourselves to prevent our past behaviors and thought patterns from creeping back in."
EatingDisorders,fo7pt1r,t3_g5ym0c,1587582462.0,"Have you tried OA meetings? You could find a group at night during your usual binge hours. They have online meetings and also telephone meetings. You are not required to talk for phone meetings, you can just listen. At least for me, it helps not to feel so lonely and that I'm hearing from a group of people who know exactly what I've been through. YMMV, good luck."

BingeEatingDisorder,fo3om88,t3_g452o5,1587490391.0,"Thank you for this. I totally agree. I'm also starting my recovery. 

There was a time when I was skinny even though I was still binging, because I'd go 24+ hours without eating, or all day that day, then just come home and binge. Sometimes I'd purge. I exercised in all my free time. At the time I thought I was so healthy, I thought I'd ""made it."" Well guess what, that lifestyle is unsustainable and extremely unhealthy. I eventually went back to compulsive overeating and binge-eating without purging and gained all the weight back and then some. 

And looking back at that time in my life, I'm not gonna lie. I'd look in the mirror and feel confident. BUT most of my life was still unhappy. I was still being totally controlled by food. I was obsessive about calories and the weight on the scale. Most of my decisions I made about my life was based on avoiding food or planning a future binge. 

You think once you finally lose weight and get down to an ""acceptable"" number, your life will magically be normal and happy and everything wrong will magically fade away. As someone who has been there - it doesn't. That's not how this works. 

The weight is a side-effect. It's not the main problem.   
*Waking up and the first thing you think about is food. Going to sleep and the last thing you think about is food. Feeling disgusted and extremely shameful about yourself all day, every day. HATING food. Yet curiously simultaneously LOVING food. Making all your choices in your life revolve around food, avoiding food, planning binging, will someone see me eat, what food will be there, will I have enough time to purge, will I be able meticulously count my calories etc etc. Not doing things, not living your life, not meeting up with friends, life on hold depends on what you weigh that day or what food you ate that day. Prioritizing food, binging, purging, etc over everything and everybody in your life. Knowing you could have a full happy life with good relationships, fun hobbies, meaningful work but also knowing you don't have this because of your fucking ED*.........**This will all still be there even if you lose the weight.** 

That's the main problem that needs solving. \^\^\^\^"
BingeEatingDisorder,fo3jvx1,t3_g4z973,1587488127.0,"If I'm doing REALLY BADLY mentally, it won't matter. But yeah, 95% of the time, late night is when most of my binging occurs. I'm trying to go to sleep really early now - like before 10:30pm preferably. It makes me feel like a granny. I have to use melatonin otherwise I can't sleep."
EatingDisorders,fo3bior,t3_g59ymb,1587484051.0,"I have been battling EDs since I was a teen but I was never as self-aware as many people seem to be online - until now. I'm almost 30-years-old. I was in deep denial. If I came across ED communities or posts or whatever that I could relate to at the time, I'd make up excuses as to why I'm ""not like them,"" or it's ""just that one thing,"" or the classic, ""well I'm not skinny so everything I do is justified."" The first time I purged was on purpose and I was very aware it was ""a thing that bulimics do"" but again - I was so convinced that that wasn't me. Nope! It was just that one time - then it was just occasionally - then it was a few times per week. But I still did not feel like I had bulimia or disordered eating because ""it's not every day and I knew what I was doing and I genuinely need to lose weight.""

The point is - some of us are really hyper-aware of our situations. Some of us aren't. And I think for those who aren't, a lot of it is steeped in denial and ""I feel fake because mine isn't as severe"" or ""mine started a completely different way,"" it is the way our brains try to distance ourselves from the reality. At the end of the day, disordered eating is disordered eating.  
My opinion only, I'm not a doctor."
