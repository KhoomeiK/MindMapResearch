I've been jumped by 3 polish lads after work simply because one of them didn't like me. Twice I've been pushed out of the department I work in & been put on a different shift because of polish employees complaining to the polish assistant manager. Joke is they waited until I was on holiday to start complaining. Just yesterday I asked somebody to move something out of my way so I could get back to my machine & got ""fucking dickhead"" as a response. 
And the females aren't much better. Tried to tell a lass she wasn't trimming things properly and was sending out work that was getting returned as defective, and got ""fuck off, fuck off, you are not my boss"" as a response.
