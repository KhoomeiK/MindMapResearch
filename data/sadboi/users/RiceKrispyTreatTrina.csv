aspergers,f6qwb2h,t3_dsbom5,1573087578.0,I couldn't relate more. I try so hard to be one of them but even with the masking.

nofriends,f5ypdeh,t3_dpl58h,1572559770.0,"I wonder why society considers being outgoing to be a positive trait. To be honest I don't vibe with people who are too bubbly or overly friendly seems I remember back in high school there was this librarian that everyone thought was a bitch but I actually vibed with her and liked her. She was way better than the overly perky chick that replaced her...

I went off on a tangent there. Yes I know what you mean. Idk maybe people are broke"
