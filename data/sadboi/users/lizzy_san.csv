selfharm,fkreqe3,t3_fk7npr,1584467398.0,Some ppl don't know how to act with this types of issues. They think staying away is going to help. Also depends age or if they knew someone that needed help but couldn't find it.
selfharm,fkqbbzc,t3_fjzmnb,1584438838.0,"Sometimes you need to find out the reason you started inorder to prevent it. For me it was an ex coming back into my work/life after 3 years. And what I thought was a friend, backstabbed me for him. The hardest part is seein everyone at work chose him over the friendship we had made over the years. I still have panic attacks if we're in the same room for too long."
selfharm,fkqaaax,t3_fjwdcy,1584437458.0,"When needed I go for a run during lunch time. I know my triggers warings (sometimes) so if they near I leave my break area, music on full blast n tell/hug myself I'm okay. I work 6-6am so nobody sees me run. I have a sweet tooth so sometimes eatin helps calm me down. I have no real friends at work to talk to abt it so music is my friend."
StopSelfHarm,fjxkzk1,t3_ff9iy2,1583676732.0,"I had been clean for 3 years but things changed, stuff happened that were out of my control. So I asked for pills and currently taking counseling. Not proud of myself but I want to stop and no one able to help me at this moment ðŸ˜”"
