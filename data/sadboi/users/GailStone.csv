antidepressants,fgsmo5r,t3_f09bgi,1581088058.0,"Hi! Bupropion is a stimulant, but it is not an amphetamine, nor is it a dissociative like ketamine. It inhibits the dopamine transporter protein, which  is what ‚Äúgrabs‚Äù dopamine from the synapse and brings it into the cell without binding to a receptor (receptor binding is the main way in which dopamine has effects). Therefore, if you inhibit the transporter protein, there is more dopamine in the synapse, so more around to stimulate the receptors. It‚Äôs a very similar concept as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor‚Äî inhibits the serotonin from being taken up at the presynapse) but by a slightly different step in the process, and with dopamine instead of serotonin. Anything that involves your dopamine system will affect alertness. This is why Wellbutrin causes you to feel more awake in addition to its antidepressant qualities. The stimulant actions are also why it‚Äôs used to treat ADHD. However, bupropion is not addictive or habit forming, nor is it related to ketamine or amphetamines (the way more common ADHD meds are forms of amphetamines). 

Sorry if this is rambly!! Feel free to ask anything else

Source: behavioral neuroscientist, have also been on bupropion for a few years, and heavily research any drug that goes in me üò¨

Edit: I meant to add, depending on your dose and natural tolerance to stimulants, the side effects you‚Äôre describing are normal and should go away as your body adjusts! I lost a lot of weight to begin with because I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to eat (stimulants mess with appetite), but that wore off once my body ‚Äúrecalibrated‚Äù, and everything went back to normal after a few weeks. Usually by the time you refill for the next month, the main negative side effects should have at least mostly subsided, as long as you‚Äôre diligent about taking it daily."

lookatmydog,fg4l6xg,t1_fg4eqrq,1580505570.0,"Agreed, fuck you u/bensho21. Pit bulls actually rank higher than golden retrievers in AKC temperament ratings, as well as in rankings for good family dogs, and dogs suited for apartment living. Besides that, *chihuahuas* actually consistently have the highest number of reported bites per year (and that's just **reported** bites, imagine how may people are too embarrassed to report that they were bitten by a fucking chihuahua). Educate yourself, don't be a mindless advocate for senseless violence."

LowLibidoCommunity,ffrj4dh,t1_ffrh2fp,1580159054.0,"The threat of pregnancy is scary (luckily, I'm currently in a same sex relationship, one thing I don't have to freak out about-- I currently use BC as a way to control my period, and in case I decide to sleep with someone who could impregnate me haha). I understand the hesitation with an IUD as well. To be honest, insertion hurts a lot, but the pain varies a lot, too. For me, it's a reasonable tradeoff for not having to worry about it for multiple years afterwards. Complications are really uncommon, for how often you hear about them! The NuvaRing still has EE in, but is much lower dose since it's a local administration. That could be a middle ground compromise, if you are really worried about IUD complications, since it's so much less invasive!"
LowLibidoCommunity,ffrfz2c,t1_ffrfbu6,1580157318.0,"There are studies that show **who** we are attracted to actually changes based on circulating levels of sex hormones, and it's very affected by oral BC! Basically it takes over your body's genetic drive towards certain individuals, which is so weird to me. Obviously every person is unique (otherwise we wouldn't have a need to discuss this type of thing!), but when I did a washout period--about 6 weeks without oral BC--my mood increased, sex drive increased, and migraines significantly decreased in number and intensity. I switched to the Mirena IUD (which uses levonorgestrol, a slightly androgenic progestin that some people love and some hate--I can tell you it's not nearly as bad for your memory as ethinyl estradiol is!), and it's been night and day in terms of side effects. Because it's androgen-derived, I feel like it actually helped my ex drive some (after I healed from an annoyingly painful insertion). If you're open to it, you could try seeing what a washout from your BC could do, and whether it changes things for you."
LowLibidoCommunity,ffrcjxd,t3_eukzbt,1580155248.0,"I‚Äôm biased because I‚Äôve studied sex hormones forever, but I think oral birth control is legitimately awful. It wouldn‚Äôt pass FDA standards if it were introduced  now, but it‚Äôs decades old so it just sticks around. When I was on it, I had an insanely low sex drive, awful migraines, and pretty intense depression, none of which I personally attributed to BC at the time, and no doctor (even at multiple migraine clinics I went to) told me that any of those were known side effects of ethinyl estradiol (synthetic estrogen and main active component in most oral BC). Even though they are all well-documented effects. Local forms of contraception (i.e., IUD, nuvaring, or using condoms, etc) tend to have fewer central effects since TECHNICALLY they only affect the repro system (although anything with hormonal effects obviously has the capacity to enter the bloodstream in small amounts). Sorry to ramble on, but I spent 3 years in a lab studying cognitive effects of sex hormones, especially birth control and menopausal hormone therapy, so I‚Äôve got some Opinions‚Ñ¢. Feel free to DM me if you have any particularly science-y questions, as this stuff is my jam!
