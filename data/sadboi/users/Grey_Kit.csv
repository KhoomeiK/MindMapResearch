We found out because she had to test for a colonoscopy after sending in a stool sample. She needed a procedure and they test before proceeding. The test 2 weeks ago came up covid positive.

My mom honestly thought we could be positive. She lost her sense of smell and taste. We as a household experienced diarrhea and body aches. Chills too.

Pro tip for getting the seal, try using playdoh or something simple that holds its shape. You dont need a fancy medium to get a good seal stamp. Playdoh will hold super well and give you all the lettering in the little cracks.

Bread dough also does the same thing but playdoh is my go to when needing a print or seal impression. [ graphic artist who creates seals and stencils for fun ]

I agree with you in this aspect. There's just so many layers to unfold for situations like this, its difficult to have an earnest convo. This is why its a struggle even. The dynamic of being who you are and feeling comfortable with who you are."
AmItheAsshole,fqrw7re,t1_fqrvlhd,1589593209.0,"I dont want to argue on the choice aspect to detract from the original intent. I will leave it with my perspective. In my experience within the trans community it is regarded as a choice because inherantly while you know you are born in the wrong body, you have the choice to adjust your life and body to better suit how you feel your true self is. During the transition journey there may even be people who realize this is part of them but not to this extent and do de transition but still live as their desired sex. There are support groups for both classes of trans.

Also please do not throw in the absolute fallacy. Inherantly life is a choice. Anything we do and identify with and as is a choice. Do not try to take that away from anyone. It causes prejudice and is an outdated statement in an attempt to support trans rights that actually just boxes people up more in emotional turmoil feeling the need to stay within a mold of the label ""trans"".

Education and perspective are very important to understanding complex social dynamics. This is my stance."
AmItheAsshole,fqrk609,t1_fqrisbp,1589585993.0,"Exactly. I am very pro trans as my employers are trans/nonbinary. This has helped give me a unique insight to the emotional issues. For sure the teen boy didn't react well, but that's an immediate reaction response that couldn't know how it would turn out because of the length of time that had elapsed in becoming friends. He is by far not excused, but I honestly feel this whole situation could have been avoided with better communication, primarily on OPs part, hence the ESH primarily OP. No one is ever forced or made to come out, but in developing friendships that you want a stronger, deeper connection to, especially a crush!, this information should be discussed pertaining to the evolving emotional connections and anatomical issues that would arise from that.

The sad part is, based on my experience, the reason OP didn't tell him is they liked the friendship and the person they are without this person knowing. They didn't want to change the dynamic by being ""trans"" but thats the issue at heart to begin with. They are upset with the teen boy for not accepting the ""trans"" aspect after exclusively being ""cis"" until it came up in a very explosive way 2 years later. The teen boy probably feels cat fished almost. Like someone he thought he knew innately is really someone completely and uniquely different, which OP didn't want to have to discuss or talk about to begin with.

This is why a sit down convo was needed instead of the teen drama of being upset right away and throwing around transphobic * which he very well could have been but likely this is not the case.. this was him asking about sex likely. Not having a vagina. Things that are considered transphobic but are things cis people trying to understand trans would say in relation to being in a relationship with someone. This likely went beyond what OP wants to talk about because the ""transphobic"" part was the boy realizing he is talking to someone who wasn't honest with him and is taking that very seriously, because he truly cared about OP and liked them.

I hope they both get counseling."
AmItheAsshole,fqrif13,t1_fqrgqwb,1589584979.0,"Thats the part about forming friendships with your true self. You dont have to hide who you are. If you lie to someone for years... and then they are upset with you because they care and you ""didn't feel comfortable telling them"".. thats a level of friendship that I would hope in 2 years id learn about you, not by force but by natural interaction and the intelligence of you know.. becoming friends.

Its not an expectation, it's a discovery process just like all new people regardless of gender/culture/etc.

That is the main issue with this post. NO a trans gender person does not ever have to force coming out. But look at this post.. OP states they have a suspicion that the guy had a crush. When forming friendships, and in this very specific case (I am not their counselor but a counselor) this situation looks like OP wanted to engage in furthering that connection, but after an extended 2 year period of feelings. This can naturally cause incongruity with the person being told because they have built up this profile and vision of someone based on the facts presented.

Now in counseling when this comes up, its a process of grieving and acceptance at the same time for the person being told. For some people who have experienced this, feelings relate to a loss, grief, anger, confusion, and an intense feeling of being lied to.. for the cis person being told!!!! 

This post is all about OPs feelings of realizing that the crush would change their perception once the truth was revealed. That truth is in deniable that they are transgender, that any relationship they have with a cis male will need intense relationship discussions on boundaries, expectations, top/bottom conversations, even transition questions. Thats ALOT for any 1 adult to take in let alone teenagers!

Everyone railing this teen boy for realizing his crush is transgender is as much an problem in the fight for equality because this is what happens! Oh no suddenly I'm not who you always thought I was and you're having emotional issues saying things that might be said in haste and without time to process emotions. You have to consider both sides of this extremely personal relationship they had.. being called transphobic when you're processing your own bombshells and emotions is also traumatic!

Beyond that... becoming friends with someone, yeah I would hope my friends are comfortable with me to not make a big deal about it but just be like hey I'm rocking this life of mine (especially to someone you think has a crush on you!). Does that make sense?? I'm not trying to vilify OPs choice to be transgender in any way, I am acknowledging both very complex emotional responses by both op and the teen boy.

This would have been a lot less awkward for both of them had OP been honest sooner knowing the guy was developing feelings. In her insecurity knowing it would likely change she kept that hidden, and now its a much bigger issue. 

I honestly feel for both of them. This is tough to navigate teen life without this extra drama."

AmItheAsshole,fqr7ywo,t1_fqr5t3e,1589579285.0,"I'm being downvoted to hell for that but honestly that is where I'm seeing the ESH situation. Especially hormonal teens, this was a shitty situation all around. OP being upset he didn't take her being trans well does not invalidate his own feelings of realizing someone he thought he trusted (possibly even liked for a potential partner) suddenly has to change 2 years of perception. 

Thats A LOT to take in for anyone. Im so sick of seeing brigades invalidating someone's emotions when they realize its not who they knew. The guy is dealing with just as much shock if not more cause OP KNEW they were hiding this vs the guy who didn't know and didn't react well to finding out.

This whole idea of forced acceptance or your transphobic? Perhaps they are accepting, just in this very personal instance it also felt like a betrayal among other things. Collapse of future visions. The realness is in forming a connection with someone with your true self. 

OP needs to understand this when waiting 2 damn years to tell someone who they ADMIT thinks has a crush on them? Why?! Because they knew it would change the dynamic? That's not fair to the either of them. 

This post got my blood boiling. I work extensively within the LBGTQIA+ community with 2 non binary employers. You all need to realize that being transgender doesn't mean that it's not emotionally stressful for the cis people its hidden from. 

This whole thread needs counseling. OP could destroy that dudes friend group with the callous transphobic accusations. Maybe they should have been more honest sooner in my personal opinion.

ESH. (But mostly OP for the way they handled this entire situation telling all the friends right away and starting drama rather than the sit down convo this needed to be after so long living the lie with someone who is crushing on you)"
AmItheAsshole,fqr64li,t1_fqr5o8w,1589578304.0,"I understand this. Im writing in the mindset of what he went through. 

So perhaps he was being transphobic while trying to understand, even if he didn't intend to be transphobic, which is exactly the point the other writers are trying to tell you.

For someone who hasn't experienced transgender individuals, they honestly can't know and would likely say really ignorant things trying to process that information. I see it happen all the time in counseling.

Please don't school me about pronouns. You can believe what you want but others believe differently. While I accept individuals pronouns, others have an extremely hard time coping and you do no justice to any trans person being snarky about pronouns."

It could be nothing. It could be covid getting worse. I feel strange because my husband, my 2 year old son, and myself are now presumed covid positive based on exposure.

We all had weird symptoms 2/3 weeks ago but never realized it was actually covid. We are in the process of being tested by the county and my mom is taking the next covid test on Sunday to determine if she still has it. We tested last Sunday and got results Monday she is covid positive.

Interestingly I have a hard time talking to anyone about it, so thank you for asking. Its literally the strangest motions of my life wondering who to tell and imagining the reality we were doing and trying to do everything according to stay at home. We still got sick, but when we contact traced, I'm not surprised. The outbreak across the street from our grocery store is the largest in the city for the nursing home facility. The kaiser covid team traced likely transmission from our grocery store. :/

So now.. until my mom is negative and we are tested to see what's going on... we see all this fighting about opening and economy/ livelihood and health... this is literally playing out in my home right now breathing and experiencing it.

I'm still going through the stages of knowing my immediate family member in my house tested positive and I am trying to maintain health vs our livelihood. We've done online grocery shopping. Haven't gone anywhere. Like its insane. 

I just hope this feeling of being cold is something that passes quickly and her test Sunday comes up negative. They say there is no sure transmission date so she could be infected and get worse, which would be around now.. ugh. Trying not to borrow worry.

In this case, being ""nice"" would be not making a big deal about pronouns. If someone misunderstood you, you have the option to correct them or not, but do not assume its ""nice"" to do by saying conform to what I want because this is me. Scientifically this is inaccurate to many people and thus its one of the biggest issues of they them pronouns. Literally and literature based definitions make the they them pronouns inaccurate, so its hard to just ""be nice"" by being incorrect. It is not an inclination to be incorrect.

Have your friend set up a routine. Routines are important.

8am. Breakfast

10am. Job hunting/money making 

12p lunch time

1p resource gathering

3p nap time (please don't skip this. If you must move quickly in the night, having napped in daylight when its safer is super important.)

5p scout for sleep space for the evening

8p (before sunset) settle on place to sleep. The best places to sleep generally are very open public spaces if you dont have a car or something secure to sleep in.

10p settle in for the night and move quickly in the morning generally 6 or 7am.

Golden rule of thumb is most residential areas near the busier places go to sleep around 8-10p. Find an area you feel is safe, well lit, with homes nearby in the event you need help. Most people will not bother homeless sleeping near their neighborhoods because most won't ever know you are there. Use general neighborhood watch areas and places that can be accessed quickly like right near main 4 way cross streets.

Find a caravan of like minded people. You will find them if your friend doesn't want to go throuhh this alone."
homeless,fozrnc9,t1_fozqvgx,1588195666.0,"Where is your friend located and do they have a battery pack? There's an essentials list for homess to gather for anyone newly homeless with a rechargeable battery.

Also pro tip. Any mall or park space generally has outdoor plugs. These are often used by the venues. Some are close to benches others are against the light poles. Find outdoor plugs and mark them on maps. Again location is key. Maximize your resources based on location.

Counseling for newly home free is usually better in person or over the phone because each situation if different and each person's needs are unique.

If you can or want to connect your friend to me please do so. I can help them get their essentials list together.

I like to say being homeless isn't the end of what you knew, its the beginning of what you never expected. There will be many familiar things same as having a home base and then there's opportunities only those home free learn about. Its not a death sentence and it doesn't have to be miserable."
homeless,fozok5a,t1_fozltjl,1588194132.0,"also if you're personally homeless and need help, let me know your general city and I can dive into all the resources in your area to link info to ♡ good luck! Its not hopeless. Its part of a journey people go on, I myself spent the 2 years home free camper living after I self bankrupted with 65k in debt (self bankrupted meaning I imploded my house, ended everything, stopped paying any bills, and literally started over for better or worse) thankfully its been so much better since I did that. Sometimes being homeless teaches you being home free isn't so bad. ♡"
homeless,fozo7vc,t1_fozltjl,1588193965.0,"It depends on the location hence why I put them there but didn't elaborate on them. 

In general,

1) there are generally food give away for the homeless at churches, usually on Saturdays. Depending on your area, look up food distribution and food assistance. The locations and times will appear. The salvation army is also an emergency food provider with their own warehouse for giveaway (i personally managed the food bank at one point for our local salvation army)

2) resume printing is the easiest because its something everyday people can help with, also businesses such as FedEx and schools will print resumes for free. Dry cleaners usually will clean an interview outfit free. There are clothing distributors for outfits if you need clean clothes as well usually churches, youth organizations like girl scouts and boy scouts, as well as private businesses like h&m will give 15% off for any clothing donated to the store to purchase a new item (depending on your area, i know my H&M is very active in this)

3) lodging is often most difficult for homeless. This is what makes an entrepreneur out of homeless. You will earn more money doing side work than you will begging. Write up some signs willing to trade work for lodging, simple chores or even errands running if you have a drivers license. Getting a bike would allow you to set up a phone app service that does bike trips like postmates and other on the go apps. 

4) speaking of apps, have a smart phone metro PC or sprint is cheap. T-mobile here is super cheap too. Get all your apps in order. There are tons of homeless connection apps that will allow you to connect with other individuals facing the same issues you are, as well as apps that keep track of goals and progress. Get your plan squared away.

The rule of homelessness is to not conduct yourself as ""homeless"", more ""homefree"". You do not have to miss showering every day, you do not have to go hungry every day. Most of the people who do this have fallen into drugs and alcohol and have chronic homeless issues. Most general individuals who become homeless can find stable ground within 2 months if they maximize all the local resources available to them including vouchers and working with programs geared for reintegration.

The other side of it is right. Stay away from the shelters unless you really need it. Exhaust all other options trying to make new connections and a new network.

As for address. If absolutely necessary, I did falsify my address the first go around to my old address I had no access to. Addresses are super important to finding your new footing so make those network connections. Ask around for someone willing to allow you to use their address for job apps if necessary. It is possible to sign up for a PO box address but thats more difficult to maintain home free because of the wide range of movement throughout the day that is possible.

Above all else, mentally preparing and keeping your mind sharp is the most important aspect. Safe places to stay during the day are dog parks, near the beaches, and anywhere away from dense buildings and apartments. Dont get caught in a stairwell alone at night without safety or protection (a weapon hopefully).

I feel compelled to type an essay to help haha. If you'd like more information or have questions please ask away!!!!! I've had 31 years living in california with most of those years in the trenches of LA working with their homeless and at risk youth. There's alot we can connect people to for help, only if they are willing to help themselves though and want to get out of their situation. Some we have found actually find it easier on the streets being home free. Thats a different counsel advice block. 

Lastly.. look for the helpers. Always look for people willing to help. Holding up a cardboard sign saying I WANT TO WORK PLEASE HIRE ME, could get you much further in life than you would expect. Many homeless have been hired and gotten out by loudly declaring they want help to get out. People want to help, including myself. :)"
homeless,fozjwk8,t1_fozg0uo,1588191898.0,"What area in California are you looking to end up at? Native californian here. I can give you some very specific locations and resources depending on the area.

Best advice is to find some roomies on Craigslist etc for rooms for rent. If you have a bit saved like 300 to 400 you can rent yourself a room for a month. That should be your first goal. Think long term.

Also California is really expensive. Be prepared for sticker shock. Wages are high here cause bills are too. Im in the LA area and OC area along the coast. Most homeless can find a room to rent and be into working with 3 weeks turn around time (I assist at needs and at risk homeless youth and adults volunteering counseling/financial planning/career building.

There's lots of tips and tricks from starting out with no where to go. 

Check r/urbanliving, r/loans, and r/homeless for a jump start on tips tricks and places to stay. Urban living has groups of caravans im sure you can join. I had 2 years camper living in my converted car and had a caravan of 3 other cars at one point all staying in the same area.

Avoid dark places to sleep and less populated. Homeless are attacked here in LA on the more secluded streets.

Be smart. Stay away from drugs no matter how tempting. You'll end up on the streets for 30+ years that route. Find the helpers. They are always around.

If you need to print a resume, there are tons of resources to do so.

If you need clothes, tons of resources as well.

Please keep a good head on your shoulders and try to lay out a long term game plan if you want to settle in California long term. Its necessary and will keep you focused on the tough days.

Homeless pro tip in LA... many people respond better to Im hungry, can you help me buy food? To im hungry can I have money. We almost always are willing to help buy food vs give money. Its just cause there are so many homeless, money is less likely to be given than real food. If you're hungry ask if someone could buy you a dollar sandwich outside a fast food place. Much better luck doing that and then saving the money you do get from asking for your lodging and other needs. As someone experienced in homelessness, you will almost always be gifted food if you're kind and polite. 

Cheers and good luck!"

Example (CA) hubby got furloughed March 13, 2020. There is literally not enough work, so his boss furloughed him completely while keeping him on payroll. His unemployment was accepted and we are getting the 375 awarded CA + the 600 weekly. He qualifies because his boss is keeping him furloughed til the 40 hours are back. He's not seeking work and he would change the circumstances if he could. (Questions you're asked during unemployment certification)

By the time they acknowledged the problem, the virus was already well spread and its new so it turned into a global pandemic by means of information suppression and lack of knowledge about covid in the beginning before genome sequence was completed.

The virus is not a political entity working for anyone. Its literally genetic material that acts parasitic in nature and attacks any human it is capable of infecting.

It is OUR OWN FAULTS. Not necessarily individuals, but society collectively ok with super mass consumerism and shallow spending. Like literally our world grinded to a halt and stopped because governments around the world, ESPECIALLY TRUMP, gutted key programs like the pandemics one left to him by Obama. 

This could have gone a million different ways. This could have been stopped instead of being called A HOAX. So many people were called crazy when we warned our neighbors and politicians of the concern. OUR PRESIDENT SAID IT WOULD MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR WHEN IT GOT WARM!

This is not going to be a V shape recovery unless we get the person who can't manage the US properly out of office. This story would have been written out and played out so differently if we had done things from the beginning BASED ON SCIENCE.

Its only my hope that now you all know. (Collective you all) us as a world. Pandemics on a global scale have been predicted and ARE POSSIBLE. It takes 3 years generally to fully circulate the globe and this is looking like its on track to feast on a majority of the 7 bill people on this planet.
