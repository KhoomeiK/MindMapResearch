Originally the reinforcement layer was woven straw mats used in building huts, walls and other structures. Nowadays this is very common in construction of walls and it's a tool in the toolbox that many engineers take advantage of. These walls are typically called geosynthetic reinforced walls or mechanically stabilized walls depending on what is used for reinforcement. 

OP is correct that the face of the wall becomes less structurally important but it's still necessary for the whole system to work."

Preheated our stone for 45 minutes before throwing this on for 10 minutes. 

Dough is from Pizza Camp, modified with 3/4 cup of the flour being barley flour and half the salt. I usually make my own sauce from canned tomatoes but in this case we used store bought for ease. Toppings are smoked chicken, salami, canned mushrooms, mozz, fresh basil and onions."
