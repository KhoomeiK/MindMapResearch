That being said you look decently attractive, I think you could go for a different look though, I think most men can‚Äôt pull off long hair kept down (as much as people shit on man buns, they look better than hair down), and could do without facial hair. A ‚Äúclean‚Äù look would suit you well I think; dark tight jeans and a simple button up, a simple ath-leisure look, stuff like that. Me and my bf call it the Mormon boy look- look up the band Beyond 5 and click on the google images, that‚Äôs the style right there."
