MtF,fm5tc08,t3_ft264b,1585779546.0,"I feel that. Definitely not alone.  Mine was supposed to be 3/3, got bumped back to 3/31, and now End of July if things can calm down. I was really really looking forward to not seeing my biggest source of dysphoria. I went through so much to get to this point so I'm trying to let myself be good with not having a date until this virus blows over."
EatingDisorders,flbabgz,t3_fnnjn3,1585000578.0,I'm 40 and have been struggling with EDNOS since I was 13ish. I'm really hoping that I have finally turned a corner. I had a major relapse about a year and a half ago. That pushed me to try recovery again. I finally broke down and at my therapist's direction I went to treatment. I have been to treatment twice and both times spent 3 months in there each time. I'm so sick of the cycle I really want to change now. I can't live with this disorder anymore.
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fkypzzt,t1_fkxpm2f,1584653742.0,"It's a shitty situation. I was very fortunate to find a psychologist who is an eating disorder specialist as well as being very trans informed. I have been in and out of my eating disorder for more than half of my life. It was my main way of coping with dysphoria. As my transition progressed and I stopped drugs and alcohol it became my only way of coping. I ended up in an inpatient treatment facility. I struggle all the time but I have support groups and lots of medical supervision. After nearly 6 months of treatment in the last year and a half I feel like I am turning a corner. During my time in treatment I realized how many trans* and queer people in general struggle with these thoughts. I would encourage you to seek professional help, someone who is an eating disorder specialist. If they do not have the knowledge they will do more harm than good."
asktransgender,fkyohb6,t1_fky4ei4,1584652852.0,"Same here, started at 35. After 5 years I can not fathom going back. I have no idea how I survived."
asktransgender,fkwinad,t3_fkphpt,1584593639.0,"Yup. Surgery was originally scheduled for 3/3/2020, got bumped to 3/31 due to hospital schedule, Monday it got bumped again. 7/28 this time. I get it. Others need the resources. Just seriously sad, I've waited 2.5 years and gone through tons of shit to get here and almost to the finish line for it to move further out."
EatingDisorders,fjg9xf7,t3_fd5nm4,1583318646.0,If you're talking about ERC Denver I would try to get out of there and get admitted to ED Care. I very rarely hear positive experiences about ERC. Most people who I have known have had similar problems with the staff there. Fighting this disorder is hard enough without having to battle the people who are supposed to help you.
bulimia,f5ds6ef,t1_f5cyxbx,1572158696.0,I have a similar diagnosis along with several other mental disorders. After trying to manage it on my own for 20+ years I finally caved and sought out treatment. I didn't believe I was that sick until I first got to residential and saw my lab results did I realize how sick I was. My psychologist called me out one session when I nearly passed out after standing up at the end of my session. I tried to stall it for a few weeks until I was told to check myself in or I would be sent in against my will. I was extremely lucky to have a treatment center that took my insurance in-state and a psychologist who specialized in ED's. An eating disorder specialist should be able to find a place that takes insurance.
asktransgender,f5dplbu,t3_dnnltt,1572157495.0,"Most days I don't wear makeup. I have 2 active kids and we are out running around almost every day, as well as we are usually outside and sweaty. We camp, bike, hike, camp, and ski almost every weekend, the last thing I want to worry about is smeary eye liner. I live in Denver and most of my cis-girlfriends, and over half of the trans* friends don't wear makeup either. If I do wear any it's a 10 minute thing. Tinted moisturizer with spf, black sparkly eyeliner, mascara, quick brow fill in, and some lightly tinted lip product. I'm lucky to have good skin and very little facial hair after laser. I don't usually do eye shadow because my eyes are pretty hooded (like the rest of my family) so it's invisible and pointless. Though I will say that another big reason is that most days I will cry at some point, so that's another problem."
MtF,eye4lif,t3_cwjlrz,1567028733.0,"Yuuup, I started therapy, running, and getting a divorce. I never realized how much I was being used and abused, until I was able to care about myself. My self hate allowed all of this to happen and continue throughout the years. After years of therapy and a few months in an eating disorder program I am finally willing to cut out the toxic people from my life and take care of myself."
TrollXChromosomes,eye1tsc,t1_eychnc1,1567027667.0,Mine did the same... She even doubled down on quite a few the other day. So glad to be done with that.
asktransgender,eye0fkb,t3_cwnzit,1567027120.0,"I'm trans femme and would say that I am more attracted to masculine people than fem, but has had relationships across the spectrum. I am attracted to the masculine energy. I personally don't really care about genitalia anymore, I understand those that do. I sometimes let the raw desires cloud my view of a person I am attracted to. It took a lot to clearly see my own biases. I have had a few trans partners that have allowed me to see things differently. I will say that having a relationship with another trans person can aggravate dysphoria. We found that would both trigger dysphoria in tiny little ways that added up to something more major. Still I find trans men do have some great advantages over cis men. If I find another trans-masc partner I would be a pretty happy girl. I say go get some coffee with her and see if she's willing to see things differently. I was."
trans,eslg4cz,t1_esjibt5,1562085064.0,"Please don't suggest exercise to someone who had/has an eating disorder. Although the advice is quite innocent and I'm sure no harm was intended, it has quite an impact to those with eating disorders. When I was very deep in my eating disorder I would take advice like that to an extreme, and use it as an excuse to be very unhealthy. All that said, OP I still love being outside and being active. I just need to make sure I am doing it for the right reasons and I am staying mindful. I also know for a fact that HRT won't do shit unless I am healthy and nourished so I'm trying to keep that in the forefront. You are looking handsome af so keep up the hard work because it is paying off."

EatingDisorders,eprlb0b,t3_bvffso,1559426623.0,"Your story is quite similar to mine. I couldn't believe that what I was doing was a problem. I would always reason my behaviors away with the thought that I wouldn't consciously hurt myself and that I could stop when I had to. I was very reluctant to bring it up with my psychologist because I wasn't as bad as others or I was just making it up. I fought against any sort of treatment for months until I was told to check myself in to a treatment program or be taken in against my will. I even thought that I was fine for the first 2 weeks of an inpatient program. Once in treatment I was finally able to see how sick I truly was and how beliefs of how people with eating disorders ""looked"" only fueled my disorder. My story is far from uncommon as I found out from others at treatment and support groups. My only advice is to seek medical assistance and be 100% truthful to your team. My disorder was so entrenched in my life that it fought really hard to stay relevant and in control. I wasn't truthful with myself or others and that made recovery so much harder."
ask_transgender,epms52a,t1_epj87xn,1559316825.0,"It's okay. We all have our battles. I am working with some great people to help me move on from this. I spent most of my life internally identifying as bi, but outwardly only dating women. I bounced back and forth between women and men. My only long term relationships were with women. I was always unable to make the initial euphoria and relief from dysphoria last. I am slowly accepting my feelings, but the toxic masculinity I have faced makes these feelings hard to accept. If I could only find and date a ftm with out being crushed with my own dysphoria..."
ask_transgender,ephnko1,t1_epez4jk,1559228901.0,"You are not alone, I have suffered a lot of abuse at the hands of men throughout my life. This makes my very strong attraction to men very problematic for me. I naturally gravitate towards the same type of people who have caused me so much pain. I'm pretty sure these feelings have been with me for a very long time, but with these feelings I have had to carry a lot of baggage and other bullshit. Going in the opposite direction and being with a feminine spirit feels nice and easy, but ignoring my needs hasn't been helpful either. So I'm stuck being unfulfilled or reliving my abuse..."
