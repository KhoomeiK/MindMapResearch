My CRP is never below 150. I'm recognised as a disabled person now. I'm in a wheelchair, I can't do stairs. I need help with pretty much everything, such as showering, getting dressed, can't make food, ect. We're currently still trying to find the right meds but the list is getting very very short. I'm currently on Ilaris (with methotrexate obv), which doesn't do anything for me either. We're even thinking that we might think outside the box and I might be the first person who gets a bone marrow transplantation in the hope that I'll be RA free then. Know that cases like me are extremely rare, my rheumatologist and others he's working with have never seen a case like me before. I'm honestly hopeful for you and I'm sure that, even though it might be a bumpy road sometimes, you'll eventually find the right meds and you'll be able to have a good life with RA mostly under control.

I was a student, in my second year of nursing school. I got into an internship for 6 weeks on ER. One day there was a massive car crash, involving a car and 2 trucks. The truckdriver later tested positive on drugs and alcohol. Now we arrived at the scene and we knew right away that this wasn't good. The truck had driven into the back of a car which resulted of that car being stuck and crushed between the truck and another truck. Now know that the car didn't even looked like a car anymore.. We got to the car, to see if there were any survivors, and when we got closer we heard someone scream at the side of the passenger saying we need to help her babies. We got to her and asked with how many people they were in the car. She then said six.. 2 adults, 4 children. They had a big family car so 2 of their children were sitting behind then and then 2 more behind them kids. We knew right away that this wasn't going to end well. We had a look at the back and the far back of the car was completely gone as you could see the front of the truck, as if the back of the car has never been. The 2 other children, who were sitting right behind their parents, they were bleeding, both crushed between their seats and the seats of their parents. We knew right away that we had to get them out of there asap as they would bleed out. Unfortunately there wasn't a quick way, the truck had to be taken away, parts of the car would have to be cut off. We couldn't even reach the kids to help them in any way. They were unconscious but still alive but we knew that there was no way we could save them in time as we could see the blood just go everywhere. I decided that I would talk to the mum while everyone was trying to find a way to get them out. I tried to calm her down, I spoke to her about random things but of course she just wanted to know how her kids were doing. By now one of the doctors were able to 'crawl' somewhat closer to the children but they had all passed away by now. We had to break her the news and it absolutely broke my heart. Her husband who was sitting next to her was unconscious the whole thing through, woke up days later in the hospital but has life changing injuries, he's paralyzed from his waist down. The mum only had a broken leg, the days she stayed in hospital she asked us multiple times if we could just give her a lethal injection so she could be with her children. 

A few months later I read in the newspaper that she had killed herself leaving a note saying she wants to be with her children. I really wish I could have done more for them."

I hope one day you do find someone who will tell you he loves you."
rheumatoid,evbujyh,t3_cj2ub6,1564395213.0,"I graduated as a nurse 3 years ago, since then I've only been able to work for 6 months. I'm unable to work now and the chances of ever being able to work as a nurse are very very small. I'll probably have to do some office job and only once or twice a week. I wish you all the best and I hope you'll never be in the situation I am. It's a nightmare to graduate but never to be able to practice your dream job. Look after yourself, take a sick day when you need it and listen to your body"
rape,etlujfm,t3_cca07a,1562945626.0,"You Will. It'll take time and lots of patience but you will. I have been abused by my dad, physically, mentally, sexually. He used to tell me that in order to be loved you need to have sex. He used to tell me that's what dad's does. Then when I was 18 I got raped by some random dickhead. He tried to kill me by hitting me with some heavy stone on my head several times. After getting through that all I was 100% sure I'd never be able to trust a male again. But I'm 24 now and I have a great relationship with someone I hope I'll get married to one day. I do have PTSD, male that come too close to me or raise their voices do make me panic but my partner made me see that not every male is the worst creature on earth. I promise you that one day you'll trust a male again, it'll start with one and slowly but surely you'll start to love someone again. Have patience, you'll get there one day"
rheumatoid,et9s7au,t3_cam2uw,1562604216.0,"Oh I lost pretty much all of my friends because of RA and my other illnesses. I used to go out weekly with a group of girls but it changed quickly when I started to be in too much pain or have too much fatigue to do so. They started going out without me and just ignored me. After them I met some other girls and same thing happened. I couldn't meet whenever. I often have/had to cancel last minute and it wasn't appreciated. I used to have so many friends and now I have 2 left. But one of them is pregnant and doesn't live close. So we're starting to lose contact too (which I understand) and then another who has a lot of friends so it's hard to meet. But I'm grateful for still having them two, out of the many I used to have. Being chronically ill really opens your eyes, that everyone is who's not family, is replaceable."
AskReddit,essejfg,t3_c8zwj2,1562250496.0,"A few years ago (I was 18, I'm 24 now) I got raped and I clearly tried to fight him off me. He wasn't happy about that so since we were in a park he took a big stone and hit me with it in my face multiple times. I was starting to lose consciousness but he made the 'mistake' to yell I take too long to die while hitting me, a couple heard this and came with a flashlight. He then stopped hitting me and ran away. I was in hospital for several weeks, nearly died because of the amount of blood I lost and the swelling blocked my breathing. I needed several surgeries to fix my face. My rapist wasn't caught right away, he was actually on the most wanted list (Belgium) for a couple of years. Last year they finally found him in another country as he did the exact same thing there but the girl didn't survived. I have PTSD now and still struggle with men."
schizophrenia,esog2gd,t1_esof404,1562166852.0,Does she see someone? Like does she do therapy? If so it might be worth it you get into contact with her therapist or psychiatrist and explain the situation. As at this point I don't think it's something you'll be able to fix on your own as it's quite complex unfortunately. Don't tell her you might contact her therapist though just see what they say first as she might react in a bad way
schizophrenia,esoe9m4,t3_c8naaw,1562165797.0,"I think it might be a good idea for you to one day take her with you to your doctor so your doctor can explain her that it's 100% you don't have schizophrenia. If she then starts to say ""yes but..."" Your doctor can then explain to her why it's not the case. I have schizophrenia and I honestly think this might ease her mind a bit. Keep in mind it might not work and she might say they're lying or trying to keep it as a secret. But I think it's definitely worth a shot"
SuicideWatch,erqrww0,t3_c34ko8,1561150544.0,"I want you to tell you that this is not your fault. A few years ago I was dating a guy, because of an accident in his childhood he became deaf. He and I suffer from the same mental illness, schizoaffective disorder. Our illness made us become close to each other and even though he was deaf and I couldn't do any sign language we started dating. At some point I was very suicidal, I did multiple attempts and at some point I figured out my master plan. I don't know exactly why but I told him how id do it, but not when. The day after I was supposed to meet him but I arrived later than I was supposed to. His parents were on holiday and as he's deaf they gave me a house key so it wouldn't be a hassle to get inside. So that day I went to his house, later than I was supposed to and I found him in his room. Hanging, opened wrists and he took an overdose too. Exactly the same way I told him I would do it. I blamed myself many many years and sometimes I realise I still tend to blame myself. But deep down I know it's not my fault. It's the same for you. There's never one reason for someone to kill themselves. There's always multiple reasons and I know she wrote in that letter that you were the last straw but you have to remember she wrote this when she was very emotional and was looking for someone to blame. I know for a fact she wouldn't want you to feel guilty and bad for the rest of your life, I know for a fact that if she could unwrite it she would as I'm sure she wouldn't want you to feel like she did at that moment. You didn't kill her, you're not the reason. I know it's hard to believe and it'll take a long time but you will get there, she would want you to be happy, she would want you to get on with your life, for her"

AskReddit,eq69x2e,t3_bxat83,1559825148.0,I used to be really into the band Twenty one pilots. I live in Belgium and there were 2 girls who basically started a fan group. They tweeted they were starting a group chat for twenty one pilots fans and that's how I met a whole load of new people. Became quite close to some. It was nice as long as it lasted
