depression,fl5pems,t3_fmfemk,1584842354.0,"Young man, my heart totally goes out to you. Your father is simply an awful person, and in my opinion he should be in custody.

I think your plan to refuse to return his household is the wisest path. And yes, by all means, tell the police exactly what you've shared here. Or simply let them read it for themselves.

Your brother and you are in grave danger, and your father is an absolute nut job.

You need to look out for yourself first and foremost. I truly hope you never have to set foot in his house again. I'm so proud of you for speaking up here."
books,fkj7qc2,t1_fkirfbj,1584238391.0,"I'm working with the book, too, after three years in the deepest depression of my adulthood. In 6 weeks, my place on the depression scale has descended from near severe to mild through working Dr. Burns' program. It's been a godsend. I wish you continued success."
bipolar,fjykorb,t3_ffctyc,1583698819.0,Wonderful news. You look great.
bipolar,fjykiou,t1_fjwwqzw,1583698719.0,Thank you for the warm reply. Things have indeed been moving in a better direction for me. I certainly hope the same continues to be true for you. All the very best.
bipolar,fjwnh9q,t3_ff1qle,1583641485.0,You look great! Wonderful to hear.
depression,fjmcwpx,t3_fe2bv5,1583467217.0,"It took me years into my most recent long depressive episode to finally let the tears fall. I think it really is a sign of healing. Until you're able to do so, a lot more pain just stays bottled up. Thanks for sharing this. I'm honestly so glad for you."
bipolar,fjmcd30,t3_fe1f1h,1583466821.0,"I commend you for stepping forward to take care of your dad in his crisis situation. It's evident how deeply you love him. You have great compassion for his condition, and you're obviously looking out for his best interests. When this episode subsides, I trust he will know that you acted appropriately."
bipolar,fjkkxvt,t3_fb1b9m,1583428819.0,Indeed it will. Thanks for the reminder!
bipolar,fjkkt5i,t3_fdnf53,1583428748.0,Couldn't agree more. Thank you so much for the reminder!
bipolar,fjgwkv8,t1_fjfrsdt,1583336951.0,That's awesome. Good sleep is such a gift to those of us dealing with bipolar disorder. I hope your day goes wonderfully.
bipolar,fjefx67,t3_fcxlrb,1583271060.0,"You made great strides. I finally cleaned my sheets a couple weeks back, and I can't tell you what a difference it made in terms of comfort. You make progress like this by incrementally taking on small tasks. I commend you on this step forward and hope that more will follow."
bipolar,fjef8nq,t3_fcl3dd,1583270816.0,It's wonderful to hear you're feeling so much better. And your artwork is beautiful. Just keep taking it a day at a time. Well done.
depression,fj44b88,t3_fbb3mx,1582999967.0,"Well done, my friend!"
bipolar,fj3scso,t3_fb42km,1582992072.0,This is brilliant. You've just touched the hearts and souls of so many of us. Thank you so much.
bipolar,fj3s0wi,t1_fj3ha4v,1582991849.0,You're most welcome. I hope you'll just continue to let your muse guide you.
bipolar,fj274wy,t1_fj24cwe,1582936227.0,"Great idea. Just this week, I read about something that I've initiated. Basically, it was an admonition to practice self-compassion by talking nicely to yourself for 5 to 10 minutes daily. It's a good way to counter the negative crap we often feed ourselves when we're down. I'm finding it to be a healthy release, probably similar to what you get by speaking your thoughts aloud and recording them. Good luck with that. I'm impressed."
bipolar,fj1r68l,t3_faxw0i,1582925970.0,Tremendous work. What talent you possess. Thanks for sharing this.
bipolar,fj0p25l,t1_fizk6ue,1582904831.0,"That's wonderful to hear. I think that anything which shifts your focus away from the notion of hopelessness is powerfully beneficial right now. I salute you for coming here and simply posting your truth. We all benefit from these dialogues, because in a way, we're talking to a personal mirror. We're all navigating the same relentless challenge of managing and coping with BP disorder. I hope your burden is just a little bit lighter today."
bipolar,fizjgd2,t1_fizbr0j,1582864494.0,"You don't sound aggressive. You sound like you're struggling with a heavy burden. It's true that many other people are out there making a living at the moment. But most of them are not having to wage this daily battle with oppressive darkness that you are. I get that it's no fun to be broke. I would suggest trying to take small manageable steps toward that next gig and then just focus on recovery time at home. It does you no good to beat yourself up. Demanding too much of yourself now is only going to push you over the edge. Just think small, incremental steps, and then give yourself some personal time and space for recovery and self-care. You know what they say ... everything's a cinch, inch by inch."
bipolar,fizaoxq,t1_fiyzu1a,1582858130.0,"While I don't know the extent of these external expectations, I can fully appreciate the inability to function in that outer world for long. ""Secluding"" yourself  is taking proper care of yourself. It's personal recovery time, and it can gradually give you the strength to step out again into that outerworld again when you need to. You're not a useless piece of shit, and you're not wasting time. You're battling to keep your head above water to attend to a cruel and relentless disease. It's imperative that you take that alone time. Try not to become your own enemy in that moment. Those critical voices are way off the mark. For the record, I'm also BP1, and during this most recent and prolonged dark stretch, I've felt at times awash in suicidal ideations. But those voices have gradually grown dimmer as I've focused on being in day-to-day survival mode. I commend you for being here another day."
bipolar,fiyxaqb,t1_fiytmk7,1582849094.0,"Thanks for the additional detail. That's a very harrowing tale. It sounds like you were frighteningly close to ending your journey. It's interesting that the view is so attractive and calming. But as you note, it may be no match for a particularly dark mindset. Again, I'm so grateful for the cat and your ability to feel that connection. Please hang in there. There's an enormous community here rooting for your endurance and survival."
depression,fiyctoc,t3_fabr73,1582836942.0,"After over 3 years of struggling through this latest dark episode, I've finally recently been able to cry occasionally. This has occurred on particularly difficult days, when I'm really feeling hopelessly lost. The tears don't last for more than a few moments, but I do feel a sense of release afterward. At first, this change bothered me. But hearing of others' difficulties to come to tears, I'm sensing this is somewhat of a positive breakthrough. Thanks for posting the question."
bipolar,fiyb85g,t3_fadm0y,1582836086.0,"I'm so glad you were receptive to the cat's approach. I can appreciate how much pain you must have been in to go to that bridge. But today you're still with us, and that makes us all collectively stronger. I wish you continued strength ... one day at a time."
bipolar,fitzlcu,t1_fisfrmt,1582732592.0,"Amen. Good luck to you, my friend."
bipolar,fis2vii,t1_fis0j80,1582676549.0,"Thanks again. If you have your own sleep struggles, then you're certainly very familiar with the challenge. Interestingly, my psychiatrist briefly gave me a shot on both 5mg and 10mg of Ambien. I felt like I was taking a placebo. The antidepressant I'm taking is phenelzine, and insomnia can be one of its side effects, which I'm suspecting is the source of my problem. I've lowered the dose once already, and I'm going to look into taking it down another notch. Sleep is so essential to our well-being with BP disorder."
bipolar,firzs6o,t1_firrzx2,1582674530.0,"Thanks so much for your support. Antihistamines are out because of a conflict with my antidepressant. And I am currently working with a time-release patch that contains among other things some melatonin. I'm also taking magnesium, zinc, and valerian root. I'm about to give l-theanine a try."
bipolar,firg5mg,t1_firff2o,1582663762.0,"Oh yes, indeed they have. Thanks for the explanation. Best wishes for the coming year."
bipolar,fireuol,t3_f9crkp,1582663051.0,"A very happy birthday to you, my friend. I'm not familiar with the age 27 stigma, but I certainly hope it's a solid year filled with stretches of recovery."
bipolar,firegnq,t3_f979bs,1582662836.0,"My current prolonged bout of bipolar depression has been characterized by intermittent insomnia. Once or twice a week, I'll get no sleep whatsoever. The mornings after are typically characterized with a sense of potential peril. Certain of those days drop me into just a dreadful pit. Then I, too, am just hanging in there and hoping all day that the next night brings me some sleep. Occasionally, I get lucky, and days after no sleep are more manageable. But I want desperately to get back to some consistent sleep pattern."
depression,fiism7h,t1_fieth8w,1582425906.0,"That's wonderful to hear. Hang in there, my friend; you've got this."
depression,ficfxc6,t3_f7ejxq,1582345955.0,"Hang in there, my friend. A lot of people are thinking about you right now, because you had the courage to share.

I would encourage you to just take some long deep breaths and focus on how they feel. Don't let these other thoughts interfere. Give yourself that little bit of relief, and then remember you can do that whenever you need to. Breaking the negative thought cycle will give you some relief.

Best of everything to you. ðŸ’Ÿ"

depression,fha2wbx,t1_fh9px02,1581395734.0,"Hang in there. The meds can make a real difference. I'm so sorry you have to wait three months before they might become available. I'm also in disbelief that your primary care doctor won't help you in that regard. Do you have any alternative to him/her? If so, I would wholeheartedly pursue it, so that you aren't stuck until this psychiatrist appointment comes along. Best of luck to you."
depression,fh6f2im,t3_f1dqmz,1581298134.0,"Two years is a long time to continue pressing forward. I'm so grateful the attempt failed and that you here to tell us about it. Carry on, my friend. You're a warrior."
relationship_advice,fe5u4n8,t3_enl4o9,1578874990.0,"I know it's hard to think about taking action against your partner. But you must realize you are at great risk if you remain in this relationship. This isn't going to be an isolated incident, and you must think about your personal safety.

Even if you don't report this to the police (which I frankly believe you should), you need to get away from this individual. I'm sure it's hard to think about the five years you've invested, but your present and future are all that really matter now.

Thank you for the courage to come here and talk about what happened. Everyone here cares about you and your ultimate well-being."
depression,fe5szww,t3_enqkiy,1578874278.0,"What an interesting topic. Yes, I have had that sensation. It's usually just some natural fragrance, and for a moment, I'm reminded of good, unburdened times. And then I just want to shut those memories off -- I can't bear the thought of longing for what was. I'm suddenly aware of this incredible chasm between where I am and where I used to be. I'm grateful you brought this up; it's just good to feel understood.

Good luck to you."
depression,fdmfog8,t1_fdmcqgw,1578548342.0,"Sending you love back, Alex."
depression,fdmflk4,t1_fdkzlfb,1578548266.0,I've had that breakthrough as well. Keeping those darkest thoughts at bay really helps us to continue to move forward. I wish you well.

depression,fdltoi1,t1_fdjqyzi,1578532243.0,"I agree with your assessment that often just getting through the day reflects our inner strength. While dark thoughts and self-doubt are constantly whirling through our brain, just taking that next step to do what is essential requires great will and fortitude. I really appreciate you acknowledging it."
depression,fdihz5j,t3_elhxst,1578443336.0,I couldn't agree more with the other comments here. Some days it can feel like an accomplishment simply to survive. But being able to scratch a big item off your to-do list is particularly gratifying and noteworthy. Thank you for sharing this simple success with us. People here can really relate to the small events that mark forward progress. Savor your success!
depression,fcond7j,t3_ei54al,1577836568.0,Thanks for the beautiful and hopeful expression. May we all make headway against this intruding darkness.

depression,fbypx2v,t3_ef4960,1577223226.0,"Thank you for your open-hearted share.

My only child, a 28-year-old son, now lives in Japan. I'm in Northern California.

He's flying in today with his girlfriend for the holidays, and I'll be picking him up and driving him to his mom's house locally. He's a wonderful young man, and I love him dearly. He flew home last Christmas, too.

But I'm just struggling with increased darkness today. I don't experience the joy I once did, and it's particularly hard when the circumstances would seem to dictate something far better. I hate wearing the mask, but it's generally what gets me through social situations like these. I just need to shut off the inner critic and proceed.

I'm sorry to hear of your own struggles, but I can certainly empathize with the effort it will take you to show up and ""act normal.""

I've seen your many kind responses to other comments on here, and I just want to acknowledge your good heart.

Do your best; that's all that we can ask of ourselves under these challenging circumstances.

And Merry Christmas."
depression,fbwlt1n,t3_eendp2,1577153298.0,"I can appreciate mastering those small challenges. I'm taking much better care of myself and I was 9 months ago, and that's indeed an achievement. I give you great credit for doing the same. Thank you for speaking out. You are a mirror for many of us."
