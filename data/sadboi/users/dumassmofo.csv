It was a treatment home for women who can't get the program, after 6 months I was working and living there to keep me on the straight path. We were required to attend AA and NA meetings daily, random drug tests as well. Depression is my main problem but anti depressants really cause me anquish. 
And it was the combination of benzos and methadone that caused the intense withdrawal,  never again. Still fighting to this day. My brain feels like it produces very little dopamine."
Methadone,fnrb3nn,t1_fnr8m7t,1587183857.0,"It's a long story. I was taking handfuls of xanax with the methadone too. Lost my job and home of 16 years. Using a friend's address in Boston (I lived there in the early 90s) I applied for  Mass Health insurance which is free for unemployed people. Once I received the card in the mail I flew out to Boston, leaving everything. (I brought my weekend take homes with) I was fucked up, as you can imagine.  Got into a 10 day detox, no helper meds either. Those 10 days were just the beginning. I hallucinated,  everyone looked like cartoon characters,  didn't sleep for weeks or eat. Once I was in the detox, there was no place else I could go. Had zero money. So I had to wait for a bed to open up in a women's long term treatment facility.  While waiting I was put in ""holding"" in New Bedford,  MA. Spent 3 weeks there which is similar to jail. Then spent the next 13 months in the Sheehan house in Tewksbury.  I remember people looked cartoonish for months. Sleep was a major problem. Just walking was painful. Indescribable feelings of worthlessness,  I felt hollow. I actually left my body and looked down on myself lying in bed one night, but it was just my skin lying there, I was the skeleton floating above. Made my skeleton self dive into my skin but only got my skull inside my face by hooking onto by teeth, Hard to describe.  But then for weeks I walked around with only my skull inside my skin, the rest of my skin body was dragging behind my skeleton, when I sat down it felt like I was sitting on bunches up piles of my skin. It was nuts. But I survived. It took months. In fucking tense."

My last corporate job was working with RTTT funds putting on trainings all throughout New England for teachers that teach AP Science,  Math and English. 
The last 4  years I've been bartending in Chicago.  I work tons of hours, save all my money. No car, rent a room and take off for 5 or 6 months each year. 2012 I went to Thailand,  I landed there with like 4 oxycontin then suffered for a few days until I moved to the jungle in northern Thailand to work at an Elephant sanctuary.  Being there in that new environment,  which was amazing, really lessened my crazy thinking and helped ease withdrawal. 2013 I went to Peru where I did ayuascha ceremonies in the Amazon jungle before traveling to Machu Picchu, the shaman even offered me to stay longer for free to help me with my addiction,  alas I choose to travel before returning to Boston for work. 2015 to 2019 I spent 5 months every year in Jamaica.  I actually built a little wooden home, no running water or electricity but still pretty awesome. Didn't do much drugs during that time except I brought kratom down there in 2018/19and became disillusioned once again.

The last in 2011 at 51 coming off 160mg methadone supplemented with handfuls of xanax. It was the most intense withdrawal that lasted months. 2 years ago I hear about kratom,  wow it sounded great cuz I've never enjoy sobriety EVER, even with my 2 year chip. So try kratom and it never really did much for me, wasn't a great high for me but I was good for coming of oxycodone. Anyway, out of habit, I just started taking k daily around 20gpd. My biggest and worse symptom was the anxiety,  holy shit.
I'm a firm believer in geographical cures, I've moved from Denver to LA to quit free basing,  got a great job and eventually started using heroin. So moved from LA to Boston for treatment,  did well, got a great job but eventually found dope again. I was immersed in music scene. From Boston to Lincoln Nebraska for treatment,  got my master's degree,  started xanax and crack, pills, methadone,  fucking shit. Back to Boston where I remained in treatment for 15 months. Even then I never felt good, life always blah and a struggle even with another great job. 2014 i traveled to Peru and spent time with a shaman and participated in 4 ayahuasca ceremonies, which actually helped.... too long a story here.

I've had one physical in the last 5 years.  Last year I used Planned Parenthood to get a mammogram and my lady parts checked. Even when I had excellent healthcare through my corporate jobs, I only went once a year."
personalfinance,fjgxjzw,t3_fcygyh,1583337501.0,"I'm 60, I actually bartend and waitress. For the last 6 years, I work for 8 months, as much as possible.  Sometimes I have 2 waitressing jobs. I'm able to save a lot of cash and then take a 3 to 5 month ""vacation"".
Last year my second job was driving a ""bar cart"" at a country club, it was fun and lucrative.  Plus I have problems with anxiety and especially depression.  Being out and about, treating people super kindly,  helps a lot. When I'm out of work for too long, I fall into a bad head space. Just walking into the bar, and seeing all the regulars truly helps me.
I would suggest that she look for a ""divey"" type bar, or one that is NOT corporate. A mom and pop cafe or friendly neighborhood bar.
Where I work, in Chicago area, it's easy to find work, especially in the summer months.  

Country clubs have all sorts of banquets and parties around the holidays as well.

Every where I apply, I get hired. Bars and restaurants have come to find that older workers are more reliable and actually care about giving good service.

I'm in decent shape, and I am told I look like I'm in my 40s. Where I bartend, I have a waitress that is in her late 60s."
roadtrip,fjetkra,t1_fjenobr,1583277974.0,"I've done quite a bit of solo travelling.  1 month in Thailand and Laos, the next year I spent one month in Peru and 10 of those days were spent deep in the jungle with a shaman (took a boat down the Amazon, then hiked in to Shaman's home) did 4 ayuascha ceremonies. 

For the last 4 years I've spent 6 months each of those years in Jamaica,  have even built a tiny place, no electric or plumbing and grew my own veggies. I do have an out house with a flush toilet in the yard. As everyone in my neighborhood does, my electricity is stolen. Jamaicans can Gerry rig anything. In 4 years, the electric company only came through my neighborhood twice. One time they unhooked the entire neighborhood,  which only took 24 hours to be re hooked up. Last year, I gave the workers 50 bucks to leave the neighborhood alone. Bribery is a great tool. I've even give police 40 bucks to not take my uninsured bike.

I leave on Monday for a 5 month trip through Mexico via bus down to Belize. I'm not inexperienced, I'm also not young and into hostels. But i have ALWAYS wanted to travel in a converted van/home and for some reason it scares me.

A companion and a dog would be perfect.

Thanks for suggestion, can you tell me more?

My fear is being alone on the road. In places where women aren't really respected. 

Have you walked the Camino? Can you tell me more?

And if you are ever in Jamaica and you want to live among the real Rastas, link me. I can set you up in an awesome place, 5 minute walk from the beach on Upstreet in Belmont Westmoreland"

I dream of this kind of travel, being a solo woman traveler,  I don't think it's possible for me. The older I get, the more I wish I were a man so as to really get into travel experiences and go off the beaten path, be able to camp alone. You are my herp."
