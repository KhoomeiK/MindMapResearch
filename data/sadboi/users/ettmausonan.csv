This show is pretty unique among shows in that it changes SO MUCH from start to finish...

Some people don't like it. Many Bob Dylan fans hated when he ""went electric...""

Your mileage may vary, but for me one of the things that seriously MAKES this show, and gives it profound existential depth, is the fact that it changes so much.

Oh you have a favorite character? Guess what THEY'RE GONE- watch how we adapt to that.

Liked us as a Network show? Guess what WE'RE ON YAHOO NOW- see how it changes everything.

One of the things I LOVE about Season Six is these PROFOUNDLY DEEP moments (that are also so quick it's easy to miss them on first watch) where we get to really see how these characters have grown and evolved"
community,fqzd1f8,t3_glqaum,1589764810.0,"First off hi! Thanks for posting, glad you're here!

So for my two cents, for one she has a tough gig- she takes a but of Pierce's role after he leaves, and it's generally a thankless job.

But also? She has some great moments in earlier seasons (and EVEN in s6 but not always); one of the redeeming factors of the dreaded Season Four is that she LEGIT ""therapizes"" Jeff and does a pretty good job, in both the ""Valloween"" and Thxgiving eps, and I love her for that...

But also, just a quick snapshot that encapsulates her for me? 

Go back to #Anniesmove and watch how Britta looks at Annie when she steps into her (revamped) bedroom for the first time; so loving! So wonderful.

Everyone in the group is ""the worst"" in at least one episode, but I give Britta credit for being the one who everyone else *decides* is ""the worst"" but is supportive and loving anyway.

Is she who she thinks she is? No. Is she misinformed on some issues? Yes. Could she MAYBE be more effective as an activist with some outside guidance? Pretty likely, I'd say.

But who's giving her that? Nobody; she's doing her best, even though it (often) leads to ridicule. But also she keeps trying! She didn't get all the wind knocked out of her sails for ""Baggle-gate,"" or even ""Blade-gate...""

Okay I think that's enough from me. I'm not trying to ""Chang your mind"" just offer some different perspective. Hope you can enjoy!
