depressed,fqvacrn,t3_gl0qk5,1589673087.0,"Are you me? I’m same age and a girl, and I completely understand how you feel. Tbh, I’ve put it down to not being that interested in dating atm. Like I thought I was weird Cos Unlike some girls I don’t rlly care for dating or looking for a boyfriend, I kinda just wanna have fun and explore the world by myself first! I put it down to me subconsciously not wanting to be with someone in this moment of time. Your brain knows what it wants, I seize up too like you described. Don’t force yourself to do something you really, deep down, don’t want atm.

I have lots of friends who like hooking up with guys without wanting to date them- we’re kinda in the same boat only we’re not turned on by strangers. I think I’d need to fall for a person first before having the urge to be intimate.

I thought it was weird but I know plenty of people like us :)"

Had skylar been investigated, so would her income- they’d wanna see where this money went after all. She couldn’t risk this as she was actively money laundering for Walt.
She did the right thing imo"

What’s kind of nice here is you didn’t do anything wrong- which means you are a good person. Good people attract people who want to walk over them, unfortunately. 
However, what happens here is you learn, you grow. You’ll be able to spot fakeness a mile away now. You’ll find your people, your soulmate and everything you can dream of! 
Be strong, seek therapy, eat healthy, look after yourself, work hard."

Work hard at what you want to do- whether it’s school or a tiny part time job it doesn’t matter. However, know your LIMITS. Don’t let people walk over you. If you’re exhausted or feel disrespected just stop. Reevaluate. You need to take pride in what you do but don’t kill yourself over it. Don’t let people take you for granted. 
If you have a problem- speak up. Do not go through life being a doormat- it just hurts. 
Make friends, cherish people who cherish you. If someone doesn’t appreciate you, they weren’t worth it. Love people, just love.
Along with this, be empathetic. Don’t be afraid to admit you did something/ acted wrongly. Owning up to mistakes leads to growth of character. (Unless someone is trying to make you feel bad, then that’s wrong).
I know your dad is gone, but this does not make you ‘man of the house’ now. You don’t need that pressure, you’re still a kid. Be there for mum, okay? She’s gonna be upset, she may try and hide it from you. 
Let her and everyone else be there for you too. Don’t try and be strong for this one. You gotta cry, and you gotta cry hard. Take these emotional issues into life with you. Emotions are fickle, try to understand them or they’ll manifest.

Dm me if you ever need to talk!. It’s been a year and I still miss him. I know how you feel."

I don’t have any advice, cos I need some too. But you’re not alone in this. I guess it’s just guys our age who just want hookups, but I don’t know how to meet older guys and I’m embarrassed by my inexperience."

But since yesterday, I started thinking about it all and I ran to my bed and hid under the covers and burst into tears, I felt like I’d be sick and my heart and brain was racing until I fell asleep. I’m a very sensitive girl but I feel like everyone sees me as someone strong. It’s really hard, and I’m actually scared of the thought of someone showing interest, yet crave it at the same time. I’m just hoping this wave doesn’t last too long. Last time I was sleeping 14hrs a day and it fucked up my uni work badly. I really wanna do well this year but I’m really stressed about everything.

I hope everything works out for you too, I’m sure you’re okay talking to girls and like me, you see yourself as someone different than others perceive you to be,"

Please don’t take the piss out of the way I write because you don’t agree with something. I was typing fast because I was in the middle of feeding my dog 😂
I thought it was dumb alright? All I meant was I don’t care really if she was gay or not, if anything it was quite nice to see, but honestly doesn’t change anything about what I feel about the character herself.
I thought it was stupid to pretend she liked a boy when she didn’t. If they went about it In a way that she wanted to be mates with him and he took it as she wanted to date him, I’d get it.
But obviously he was gonna take it as “she likes me, I like her too!”
My opinion is: it’s bullshit.
Your opinion: means nothing to me now because you get angry over internet strangers opinion. Lmao 🤘🏻"

that was kinda bullshit tbh. Idc about her being gay, like well done, fair play to her yanno? It’s nice to have a gay character who’s main character trait isn’t “I am a gay”. But all she was saying to Steve was stupid. If she was going about it like “I would’ve liked to be your mate” sort of thing not “I sat behind you and stared at you all day JK WAS STARING AT GIRL” 

Nah. Bullshit. 😂"
