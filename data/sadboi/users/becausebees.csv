Vans,fr01666,t1_fr00z6j,1589780744.0,"According to the details, it ends at 11:59pm PDT on the 17th. It's still only 10:45 PDT, so it should still be valid."
chicago,fqoqw9v,t1_fqopylr,1589522238.0,Me too! I live on the first floor though so I was just going to spend the night in the bathtub if it got too bad
lululemon,fqezfvz,t1_fqenz0y,1589316156.0,"Hmmmm so strange! I think I might wait it out until the stores open to talk to someone there and return them. Unfortunately the 23"" in black are all sold out, and i don't want to keep the 19"" since they look so stumpy on my legs."
lululemon,fq00q4r,t1_fpyjmb4,1589026386.0,Algae WT 25” in stock sizes 4-12 as of right now! :D
lululemon,fpyh7yy,t1_fpygt3t,1589003830.0,Haha yeah unfortunately like 3am eastern time. But sometimes they still have a bunch of sizes in stock around 8/9am! I almost bought a pair the other morning but I decided on the algae green invigorates instead hahah
lululemon,fpygige,t1_fpxkc6n,1589003515.0,They’ve been restocking the algae green WTs occasionally in the middle of the night (US time). Keep an eye out and they might pop back up in your size :)
terriblefandommemes,fl4z4te,t3_fmfzdi,1584824833.0,I physically made a disgusted face. Lord
lululemon,fky87sw,t1_fkktai8,1584643573.0,"""I'm 5'2 and I bought the ""tall"" pants, why are they so long! What the heck! They'd be perfect if they were just shorter! Zero stars"""

ExNoContact,fi3lipl,t1_fi3hw8l,1582122157.0,"Write all you want to say on paper or in a journal. That helps me sometimes. Just the act of writing the words satisfies the urge, and it helps you move forward to the next part of your day."
ExNoContact,fi30lop,t1_fi2y7hz,1582095652.0,I wrote this post instead of picking up and calling him. We got this. It's hard.

ExNoContact,fdkb2nd,t3_elqsnt,1578500103.0,My ex's birthday is 2 weeks from today. I always loved spoiling him with gifts and taking him out to dinner. I still catch myself thinking about what gifts he'd might like. I want to text him too and say happy birthday but I won't. Stay strong.
ExNoContact,fdhy3pa,t1_fdhpwgp,1578432262.0,"Thank you. I just have to keep telling myself the bad things he said during the breakup, and how he's not the same person I fell in love with anymore. I won't let him win."
depression,fc0e0dz,t3_ef4960,1577288235.0,My boyfriend left me 2 months ago. We spent the last 5 Christmases together with our families. I always did all the Christmas decorating for us in our apartment. I had to force myself to this year. But for who? Myself? It's so hard to care anymore. Today I have to go spend the day with my happy family and it'll be a constant reminder he's not there anymore. I feel empty.
terriblefandommemes,es9se2d,t3_c6i9kp,1561743433.0,This might actually be the worst thing I have ever seen. I have no words.
