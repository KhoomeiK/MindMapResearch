The personto me is looking for a way out.. An escape from modernity.. Yet the character to me is stuck and seeks an escape from his dreary chores of his family life.. 

All in all pretty interesting poem, surface level it may seem a bit choppy but there is more to this than it seems.. I like the type of world your portraying because it seems so... Real and gritty.. It seems to be within the reaches of this world.."
OCPoetry,fq4lwns,t3_ggehk9,1589079402.0,"Wow okay this poem really goes indepth of human sadness for me and how society when you let it can get to you such as the letter got to the person receiving it.. 

I like how you don't go indepth and just explain and lay out the sorrow or rejection because it leaves the reader with a little something to ponder and think about making it different for each reader to imagine how one would think or react in that certain scenario."

What I'm getting to is, life is suffering.. But I'd rather suffer together than suffer alone.

By suffering together I mean acknowledging that I'm not the only one who feels the same way.. Millions of people are conflicted with self-hatred and depression so I find comfort in the fact that I'm not alone..
