smalldickproblems,fmwwuhw,t3_fxtvnr,1586454442.0,I feel you. It's like they simply lose all empathy when it comes to people with small penises. People are so ignorant and desperate to feel better than others that they will target anyone who is in a vulnerable mindset.
Fuckthealtright,fm5gjsz,t1_fm58ijf,1585772541.0,"Why is it so difficult for you to understand that offending other people's appearance is bad? When you make these jokes, you are not offending the right, you are offending a specific group of people that were born like that. You are not taking trump down by making penis jokes.  It is that simple. If you wanna offend the right, then focus on whats actually important and criticize them for all the stupid things they do, all the retrograde shit they say. All you are doing now is targeting a group that already suffers from a lot of derogatory speech, and losing their support.  
By the way, I'm also pretty sure that one of the rules of this subreddit is literally ""Focus on the alt-right"". And that is what you should've done."
Fuckthealtright,fm4rcns,t1_fm4pagn,1585759387.0,"It doesn't matter if you have a small penis. You are objectively making fun of a body type, and that's what matters. It perpetuates a negative stigma and has indirect effects on other people. You should criticize Shapiro by the terrible things he has said and done, not by his appearance. And by your logic, you could do any discriminatory/derogatory joke, as long as the person you wanna affect takes offense in that. And that is very incoherent and stupid. It is basically, the same logic the right uses to legitimate their terrible jokes."
Fuckthealtright,fm3xkwo,t3_fsir7x,1585740595.0,What does penis size have to do with it? Criticize Ben Shapiro for the idiot that he actually is. Stop trying to make fun of how other people look or how their body is. You are basically contributing to body shaming and discrimination.

And I do remember searching it back in high school, the main and only thing that would have popped up was Nikola Tesla.

SuicideWatch,fady2m9,t3_e8gjky,1575989291.0,"I'm very sorry all that happened to you. I hope you know it's not your fault. And I really hope that time can help you recover from it, and reconstruct your life, one step at a time. I suggest you don't keep it to yourself for too long and find someone who you can talk to and help you. Keeping it inside your mind can really hurt you more than you already are.

As for your girlfriend, she is definitely confused and traumatised. Maybe not as much as you might be, but that day definitely had a toll on her too, and that can cause her to say hurtful things without having the awareness to realize it. I could never be sure, but I think she might be avoiding you or treating you differently because she is afraid her affection might trigger bad feelings and traumatic reactions either from you or herself. Either way, it is possibly that the best right now is taking some time for both of you to work on your own thoughts and get help to find some peace of mind.

 If you ever feel sad or lonely, know that those are valid feelings and you need to allow yourself to feel it. If you ever feel useless and incapable, know that you did what you could and that things could have escalated and gone even worse if you had done something different. Take what happened and work with what you have. Trust in yourself, cry if you need to, it might help you understand what causes it and how you want to deal with your those feelings and then share it with someone you trust. That way you can have a better guidance and not just act instinctively. You can get out of this! I truly believe it. First get some help. Talk to someone who can help you see this situation clearer. A professional in mental health or someone you trust can be a nice first step. And finally after a while, if you feel like you are ready, talk to people who have gone through similar events and share with them your thoughts in a controlled space. There are many support groups that can give you the chance to connect with people who truly understand you and that can help you through this process.

It is going to a long journey, but I hope you can find the strength to fight and work to for a better future for yourself and eventually find some peace of mind."

FORTnITE,f5r7hvj,t1_f5r4op2,1572389485.0,Yeah... Even from a promotional standpoint this is a fiasco. How is it supposed to motivate you to buy the game if you can play a LTM and defeat the last boss of the game with no grind at all? It renders all the path you take to get to the that boss pointless. It is as if a theatre showed you the end of a movie before asking if you want to buy a ticket. What's the motivation in buying STW if you have got to experience it for free in BR?! This is honestly a joke.
