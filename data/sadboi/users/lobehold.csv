thanatophobia,fo1lq44,t3_g53k5q,1587436052.0,"> Why people don't despair facing this reality? How do they keep on living a good life having children, building houses or even sleep?

You know, human beings having ""good life"" is a recent thing.

From the time human beings came into existence to about about hundred or so years ago life was short and shitty. Hell it still is if you're born in conflict zone/poor countries.

You're not worried about dying in the far future, you're worry about dying next month, next week or even next day.

I mean sure there always have been philosophers, but to be able to sit around all day just wondering about things was a luxury afforded to the few, most were living hand to mouth.

There really is nothing you can do about it, so why not just give up worrying?

Throw your hands up and just declare defeat and go on living your life?

What else can you do anyways? I mean sure if you can somehow harness this into achieving greatness then awesome, but otherwise the only thing left is just acknowledge it ""yep, gonna die someday, isn't that shitty?"" and move on."

 - Support the troops without taking care of veterans and avoid getting into unnecessary wars
 - Worship God and Jesus but ignores every lesson in the bible
 - Receiving government support while believing they all did it on their own, and nobody should have ""handouts"".

He is the king of assholes."

This is something we all either confront ourselves with, or push away by keeping ourselves busy and preoccupied.

At the end of the day nothing you can do about it, just have to live your life and then die.

Honestly I think your problem is that you low-key worry about it all the time, you need to be paralyzed with fear for like 2-3 weeks constantly thinking about it and being afraid, just get it the heck out of your system, and then get so sick and tired of being afraid and stressed you just say fuck it, whatever happens happens and move on.

That's how I dealt with it. Almost a month of high level stress, cramped stomach morning til night. I was so stressed I was sleepy around 6pm since my mind would never rest, finally I woke up one day and just went ""fuck it, I'm moving on"".

I literally ran out of steam."

You can't apply science and logic to magical zombies, only the infected type zombies."

Secondly, he can't arbitrarily or unreasonably withhold consent to the sublet, however the problem is you need to go to the LTB to protest his decision to withhold consent, which isn't functional right now.

Which means that if you move someone in without his consent (unreasonable as the refusal may be), you're violating the tenancy act by having an unauthorized tenant there.

Of course the LL still can't evict due to the ban, but after the ban ends he could probably use this reason to evict.

Safest way to keep the place would be to pay for rent and leave it empty. I assume you want to keep the place because the rent is cheap, might be worth it to leave it empty then."

You can absolutely wait, as long as you're not stressing it and let it heal up. A bad bite or slightly screwed up joint is not going to cause damage by itself, you have to apply (excessive) force to it."
