AskReddit,fpx9tr9,t3_gfsuqt,1588978455.0,"I worked for an electronics retailer about 15 or 20 years ago, and one of our policies, which wasn't widely advertised but was available, was that we could do 5-10% discount for non-profit organizations that were ordering large quantities of equipment. Primarily available as an enticement to land large orders.

I was working with a local non-profit that was looking to buy 25 computers and several printers, plus the peripherals and pro-sumer infrastructure to build it all out. This was a bit of a stretch for the retailer but we had the resources that we could call in, and would have essentially amounted to a $75,000 sale for me.

I did the calculations on the profit margin and confirmed with my regional manager that a 3% discount was acceptable in order to land the sale, but was told by the store manager not to offer it, and instead walk the customer (decline the sale).

I left work that day and had a few days off, so I came back in and decided to check in on my contact just as a gesture of good faith, only to find out that the store manager had rung up the sale. My contact mentioned the price paid and it was 3% higher than the price listed in the computer system.

I went to the store manager and asked about this, only to be told not to worry about it, meaning I'd lost out on commission on over $70,000. After that I was taken off the schedule and ultimately fired for missing a store meeting that was rescheduled. In the few weeks that I wasn't on the schedule but technically still employed, though, I reached out to the regional manager, who did some digging and found that the store manager and two assistant managers had overcharged non-profits and business clients to the tune of $150,000 or so over the course of the prior year, pocketing the difference. The store manager ended up getting charged with fraud and embezzlement and the two AMs were at least fired, if not charged."

I ended up with this one because my roommate had one and I tried it after trying the Phoenix I'd bought and it was actually quieter, so I returned the Phoenix and used the savings to buy more pedals that I don't need.

I'll try isolating the Holy Stain and the Muff. I've already got most of the digital pedals isolated but I'll try to track down whether any of them are sharing and isolate them too."

The downside is that it's become big business and the licenses are bought up by those with deep pockets to make them deeper. Makes it harder to buy local when local isn't legal but regional or statewide is."

""Oh, okay, cool, thanks.""

I do miss the feeling of being in something together with someone that it brought, though. When it's readily available it's no longer a thing so you don't really have smoke circles so much as just stepping people stepping out for a few hits."

Nowadays when people ask about the weed I have they wanna know if it's some ""watermelon candy ganja"" or ""lemon buttermilk haze"" or some shit. Before when someone asked what strain I had I could confidently answer ""Vinnie's pizza back room. I have a guy."""
