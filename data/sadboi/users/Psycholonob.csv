My friend took it to the Antiques Road Show who appraised it as likely 17C, possibly dutch and original.  It’s not something that my friend plans to sell right now as it has sentimental value, but he needs to insure it.  He was told that it was probably worth a few thousand pounds, but if the artist could be identified the value would be significantly higher given it’s quality and comedic scene.

Having been in a similar situation, all I can tell you is that the love may never die, but it won’t always hurt this much.  You may not believe that, but please try.  You can still find love, peace and security, but you just need to get through the next few weeks and it’s going to be hard.   Go and talk to a friend or someone in your family that you trust.   Find something to do to take your mind off things - when I feel like this I always watch bushcraft and survival videos and imagine how i’d survive on my own in the woods, needing nobody and nothing, just relying on my feminine strength and will to survive.   You are worth more than you idolised feelings driven by your ways of surviving in the past.  Your intensity of feeling may well be more than any person could manage right now, and reaching out to him is unlikely to be helpful in any way, and might push him away further.  

This is going to sound a bit “woo woo”, but if you can, mindfully step back from how you are feeling right now and get back in touch with the universe, mother nature, and spirit.   Expand your consciousness into every single living thing and lose touch with your own personal self and ego.  You are a living, walking, miracle of intelligence and consciousness - somehow mysteriously here on this planet for a whisper of a second.  You are a part of a greater divine consciousness, and your inner light is so much bigger than any of this.   Feel love for him not as someone that should love you, or has abandoned you, but as a fellow miracle trying blindly to understand and find truth in this crazy and magical thing we call life.

I’ve had two friends go here on separate occasions in Spain and have an amazing experience.  Very basic accommodation but good vibes."
survivorsofabuse,evk93cj,t3_cjzx3v,1564577694.0,"Borderline Personality Disorder:

Rapid mood swings
Intense fear of abandonment
Insecure attachment style/clingy/jealous with “black and white” thinking (good person/bad person)
Impulsivity - can include self-harm and alcohol/drugs
Recklessness
Intense feelings of emptiness, 
often chronic suicidal thoughts or acts
Occasionally some odd visual or auditory hallucinations (but not often)
Things can escalate or destabilise when relationships are threatened (breakup, end of therapy, loss of friend, bereavement). 

Could he have some traits?  It is pervasive and normally affects all friendships/work relationships/intimacy/family.  It normally becomes evident in teenage years or early adulthood.  Often there is a history of trauma, and it is sometimes seen as a maladaptive coping/survival response to neglect or abuse where the infant’s attachment to their primary care giver is rendered unsafe or inadequate.  

There is very good therapy for this kind of disorder,  often psychotherapy groups work particularly well because relationships that develop between group members can be used in therapy.  People with BPD can and do work on themselves to achieve stability and ability to sustain meaninful relationships.  I’ve seen it.

It is abuse though, and the above does not take away his capacity or ability to know right from wrong.   I suppose it depends if he is prepared to acknowledge that he has a problem and agrees to work on it or not.  It also depends on whether it is worth it for you.  Does the abuse and distrust outweigh the good?  Can you live like this for as long as it might take? (Often years)

fantasywriters,euch3d4,t3_cfr81u,1563674921.0,One of your main characters could be a f-m transgender character and we not find this out until later on.   Is the story set in old fashioned times when this sort of thing couldnt be spoken of or admitted to?
