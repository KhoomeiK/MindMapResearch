ptsd,f9rokxm,t3_e6kx9q,1575579144.0,"In the book “the body keeps the score” it talks about this... a test where the subject has a limited period of time to say as many words as they can that start with the letter “B”... when I did this all I got was Baby, Ball, Buggy, Basket and then my mind went blank.   I never lost the words, I just wasn’t able to access them in an arbitrary fashion. The thinking is that our brain got rewired for only survival necessary processes.   

EMDR helped out a lot... I’m not 100% like I was before, but close enough to function."
