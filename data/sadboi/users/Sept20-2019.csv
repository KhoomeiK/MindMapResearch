Codependency,f3uyl0k,t1_f3umo4f,1571169187.0,"The way something is presented or how you see it in your mind. 

You're freshly in love? That person's little quirk is cute. 
You're angry with them? They're doing the quirk to annoy you. 

An overall positive/negative view of something/someone influences how you see things and feel about them. That has substantial influence on how you feel and perceive them and yourself. 

The good news is that we can choose how to ""frame"" things - if we think of a situation or person as a HUGE painting, imagine yourself taking a regular sized picture frame and holding it up to the very large painting. Depending on what you fit in the frame, you see different things. 

Movies will show you one side of a situation, and then show you an entirely different side - think of the movie The Sixth Sense. Depending on what you saw, you had a different perspective. Same facts, different frame. 

We are in charge of our past, our present, and our future.  We can change our past by changing the way we see it - get out of the triangle of victim/persecutor/rescuer - re-envision ourself as a glorious victor who triumphed through the worst adversity. That's re-framing - we often feel the bad stuff and get stuck there - but you never see a superhero's back story from that perspective!  :)
