What I mean by this is stand in front of a mirror topless, raise one arm above your head and hold it there and observe any unusual areas of skin around the areola that may look like a dent or a small spot someone is tugging on... you know like when you snag a shirt and it‚Äôs got that line of thread from the snag that gives it a small wrinkly appearance. You‚Äôre looking for this. Do this for both sides. 

Then put your hands behind you back slightly and lean forward at like a 30* angle or so... let your girls just hang forward. From this angle your looking for the same thing. 

Sometimes tumors in the tissue can cause this snagged appearance in the tissue just above it or surrounding it. So it‚Äôs important to not only palpate the tissue but also look for appearances of any irregular wrinkles that could potentially be indicative of a tumor."
AmItheButtface,fqb4bvw,t3_ghpixv,1589230351.0,"Well here is something to consider. You said how you felt. Your feelings aren‚Äôt right or wrong they are subjective and they are feelings. You felt that what she did wasn‚Äôt a trait you liked so you felt the need to say no. There is nothing wrong with you feeling your feelings and proclaiming what would and wouldn‚Äôt work for you. 

On the other hand to see this from another perspective it appears that she was overweight, tried dating, was rejected, she didn‚Äôt like being fat or being rejected so she took control on her life and did what was best for her. Which was fantastic! The result is, she now has a physique that is more appealing to the eye than what she had before. There is nothing wrong with her desire to change her life and get healthy. And if it was just this fact alone for the reason why you told her no to dating I would say YTBF. 

But...Was it really the revenge body behavior that bothered you or was it the perhaps anger/bitterness she still held toward me that previous gent enough to make her want to reject him and feel how she felt (not sure if that was her intention or not). Because seeing anger or bitterness in someone from their past enough to enact revenge is a behavior that is wise to be wary of when dating and if this is why you rejected her then I say NTB

There are plenty of overweight folks who are gorgeous and are actively dating and might not have the revenge anger bitterness behavior even though they might have experienced the reactions in their past. It‚Äôs that stuff in our hearts  that comes out that I feel can make or break a persons attractiveness."

Solo cups do come in other colors but red was the predominant color. 

There in coffee shops there is the solo size of espresso. And the use of the term solo actually refers to the amount of shots of espresso, solo or dopio (1 or 2 shots) which in this instance can be considered a unit of measurement as most single shots are one ounce and most double shots are then 2 ounces."

UniversityofKansas,fppw8vt,t3_gerq13,1588810375.0,"So long fellow Arizonan, I‚Äôm from KS and moved to AZ. KU Grad class 00. Have you been to Cali in the summer and you can feel the humidity? Remember how the humidity makes the weather feel a bit warmer than it is? Is like that. A 40* AZ night in the spring feels as cold as a 20* freezing night in KS. When it‚Äôs 40* in KS that‚Äôs like 60 here in AZ. 


It‚Äôs grey skies in the winter and all the green goes away. But you‚Äôll be fine with some good winter boots (I recommend getting water proof spray at like an auto shop and spraying that in the boots to help keep the water and slush out of your shoes). Got a good solid winter coat that has a layer for windbreaker. The bitter wind is frigid!! It‚Äôs warm in ks September-Nov... (think like an Arizona spring. But when the cold hits, it‚Äôs kick in the shorts. 

Jeans, shorts, sweatshirts or hoodies and jackets. Layers like in AZ. They won‚Äôt have days that start in the 20‚Äôs and rise to the 70‚Äôs in the afternoon but they do have their fair share of temp difference during the day. 

Don‚Äôt forget to smell the dew in the mornings, it‚Äôs glorious. AZ has an arid smell which is lovely for its own but you can almost smell the life that the morning mist brings to the flowers and trees. 

Humidity in the summer is real. Remember it makes things warmer. 100* in AZ is almost tolerable after being stuck inside a freezing ac-cooled building. Get hot, step in the shade and the Temp drops 10* automatically. Not in KS in the summer. When it‚Äôs hot and humid you are HOT AND HUMID. boob sweat and swass are real. (For guys and girls) and sun or shade won‚Äôt matter as far as the temp. You‚Äôll be hot in the summer."
