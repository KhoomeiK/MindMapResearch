bodymods,flcjc89,t1_fl9slaz,1585033119.0,"Agreed. To explain, the tongue is one of the fastest regenerating organs in the body. I can't remember specifically, but it's something like a 2 week period for a completely new cell set. Long of the short of it is, a tongue piercing can close in mere hours. Had a friend that got a job they really wanted at a swanky place and took it out just to be sure. 3 hours later and when they went to put it back in the hole was closed. What your doing is basically shrinking and stretching your tongue Constantly, which is bound to cause problems.

TL:DR See a doctor, random person"

depression,fbmeerx,t3_edpkii,1576982523.0,Yeah. My anxiety and depression come out that way. It fucking sucks the second that moment is over.

AskReddit,fbizeyu,t3_e6cikd,1576920302.0,"Bondage, physical stuff (biting, scratching, squeezing, pinching, hair pulling, choking, etc) nipple play, estim, cbt, especially going after you cum cause like damn, slut shaming, pimping (being told who to go fuck) wax play, edging, public teasing (Bluetooth buttplug for the win), sounding is something I wanna try. Also pegging. Holy fuck the first time I felt a bigass (puns haha) dildo slip in oooooh fuck. But overall just being a general sub/masochist. Oh, also wrestling for some reason. The feeling of struggling against another person like that is really somethin for me. 

Edit: forgot humiliation, even tho it's a given at this point lol. Also, and this is fuckin weird, having someone suck on my tongue. Dom did that to tease me and idk like damn."

SuicideWatch,f9x6ei1,t1_f9x10sh,1575705528.0,"Hey, I just wanna say that the point I was trying to make is that you shouldn't strive for a friendship that is based solely on having fun and trying to ignore what's going on. They should be based on having someone that will support you and make sure your ok, not just using you as a means to an end to have fun"

SuicideWatch,f9x1vyo,t1_f9x0v04,1575703144.0,"Well depression, panic attacks and drunks are my language. I don't think I can say anything to help you but I can offer you my techniques. When I'm having a bad time, depression, anxiety or other wise I repeat deep breath in 1,2,3,4,5 deep breath out 1,2,3,4,5. I actually have it tattooed on my ribs, it's saved my life before. When I'm having an attack start listing your surroundings, I generally go for color of the walls, how many windows, etc. 

As for drunks, there's not a whole lot you can do and it sucks. They yell and scream and break stuff and hit and it sucks. All I've ever done is learn who to absolutely never be from the shit headed drunk I call my dad, and it honestly has shaped me into a lot better person than I could have been."

SuicideWatch,f9wznzd,t1_f9wz9v3,1575701920.0,"So this last week I was road tripping in my beater because I knew it was on its last legs and the plan was to scrap it after the trip. So I make it like a 600 miles out, just lookin at sights without a single peep out of the car. So I'm finally on my way back and 200 miles from home I suddenly hear a loud bang and my car just stops so long story short I cruise into town on a prayer and a few days later I have my car in a scrapyard and 300 dollars in hand and super excited to finally get home, which takes a 3am bus"

SuicideWatch,f9wyd6t,t1_f9wx28e,1575701203.0,"On that second point, I don't believe anyone that suffers in unlikeable because they suffer. I think that a lot of people are just incredibly shallow and fail to see a person beyond suffering, beyond what they are going through. Honestly it sucks cause you run into people that you really want to care but they are shallow and all they care about is that your suffering is making things difficult for them. And that's not on you but it still sucks."
SuicideWatch,f9wxyzx,t1_f9wx28e,1575700982.0,"I agree. I think that in general people care about the idea of a person or the group I suppose, but can't really care because there's no real connection."
SuicideWatch,f9wv3v6,t3_e7afmu,1575699423.0,"If I'm being honest, in my experience, one of the most valuable things you can do is just wrap her up in a hug when you get the chance and be open. Tell her your scared of losing someone that you love so much and that you genuinely just want to be there for her. Be just true to how much you treasure and love and care about her. 

But, that's what I needed from my SO when I was intensely suicidal and I don't know you or her, so all I can do is offer my perspective."

But if you wanna reminisce or mourn the loss of a friend or just talk or whatever it is that you need an ear for, I'm happy to listen."
