If someone openly identifies as gay and still goes to church, pays tithing, follows all the commandments, etc, they will (in my experience) be respected and likely even held up as a good example—*""it's so inspiring that he's so strong in the church despite his challenges.""*

This admiration only lasts as long as the individual is not dating or having sex with someone of the same gender. Then they're sinning and giving into temptation. Even then, the *outward* respect could still be there. *""We all have challenges and give into temptation sometimes, you can still repent and come back.""* This is still outwardly (air-quotes) ""accepting"" (as in I accept your flaws and sins).

**********

Now, if they are openly dating people of the same gender, don't see that as sinning, and don't plan to change?  That's something different; there's not really any room in the church for someone who disagrees with doctrine and flouts the commandments like that.

Most Mormons nowadays would not completely cut off a family member for being gay. So I don't think it's particularly unusual that the dad is still a part of their lives.

The church doctrine and teachings, however, are very bad for LGBT people. There is a huge conflict between that part of a person's identity, and the lifestyle that the Mormon church prescribes. (Hence why he entered into a mixed orientation marriage in the first place. According to the church, getting married is the Right Thing To Do and leads to happiness. ""Just marry someone of the opposite sex"" used to be the standard advice.)

I think the typical outcome nowadays (based on my own experience and anecdotes) is that the LGBT individual will most likely distance themself from the church, but they are not likely to be cut off or shunned completely."
