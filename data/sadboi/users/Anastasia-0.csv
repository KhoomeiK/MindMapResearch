Hm.. at least I know I’m not contributing to it. For now maybe it isn’t making such a big difference, but over time not as many animals will be killed. I mean it’s all about what the customer wants. So now when more and more people are starting to choose plant based options instead of meat, the people who produce meat would loose money if they killed as many animals as they did before.. 
I’ve heard about different small farms closing down because they can’t sell cow milk etc..
