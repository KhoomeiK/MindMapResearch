I was in a sort of  similar position with serious health issues and growing up in a church of christ, so I was also fed all of that ""you're a miracle"" and ""God saved you"" bullshit. Although for me that didn't end up cracking per se until I was in my preteen years and found out I couldn't carry a child and give birth. Thus, I was unable to fulfill my ""duty"" as a Christian woman by getting married and popping out a bunch of kids.

It *really* fucked with me for a long time. And started a chain reaction of me questioning more and more shit. In my late teen years a few really traumatic events happened that shook my faith even more. Through all of it though I did a ton of growing and changing. Now I'm not religious at all, I'm bisexual and have a girlfriend I'm planning on proposing to, and I now identify as non-binary.

So, with Josie I'm a bit torn. The Duggars are a bit more deep in the kool aid than I was, and it took some pretty big traumatic events to really really turn me away from my faith and allow me to actually become my true self."

I was not as active when I had lines though, as I typically had them while recovering from major abdominal surgery. I imagine for a more active patient that would be sweating more often, the dressing would definitely need to be changed more than once a week.

I myself started experimenting with crossdressing more when I was questioning my gender identity. 

People have an issue with the way it's used and portrayed in gacha life because of the way it's always tied to UwU gays and stereotyping a feminine gay, instead of just having a normal average gay couple. Not all gay couples have a ""feminine"" and ""masculine"" one and that kind of stereotyping and assumption can be damaging to the community. And, while there may be some gay men who are extremely flamboyant and embrace very feminine things, that isnt really a thing you just see all the time. You dont really see random homosexual couples wandering around and one of them is wearing a very frilly dress. Not that it's a bad thing if they are, it's just an overused as shit stereotype."

I ended up with a psychologist suggesting I may have it based on my symptoms while I was hospitalized for a surgical procedure and was also having a hard time with my mental health. Then it was brought up again several months later when I was admitted to a psych hospital because I was self harming and wanting to kill myself. The psychologist there gave me the diagnosis after a few 1 on 1 sessions, a look at my history, all that stuff. Once I was out of the hospital and in outpatient therapy and a bit more stable on better antidepressants I was reflecting a lot and realizing ""holy shit"" because it finally all just clicked together of why I felt the way I did.

I'm sorry you got a misdiagnosis that's still hanging over you. I really hate getting trapped by leading questions and stuff. :< that really sucks."
illnessfakersgonewild,fo3s16m,t1_fo3i6z2,1587492001.0,"Not usually. From my understanding, you need to be at least a young adult. I wasn't diagnosed until I was about 23 and in the absolute worst of the worst of it. Looking back at my teen years I can absolutely see the behavioral patterns forming, and even some of the symptoms, but since your brain doesn't really mature fully until about 24-25 it's very very unusual to diagnose a personality disorder in someone who's a teenager."

Stress has been really high during this time but me and my roommates have been spending a lot of quality time together. My relationships are better than ever during the quarantine."
