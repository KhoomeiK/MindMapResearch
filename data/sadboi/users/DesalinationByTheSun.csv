I didn't ever do well in math despite finding it cool, so I ended up hating it. Never understood it due to missing some core basics growing up. Picked a major that was the furthest thing from math I could go (liberal arts). Purposely put off my math requirements until right before I planned to transfer. Ended up in a geology class and accidentally fell in love. For once math made sense! Physics? Not a tug of war in my brain anymore. Stats? EASY. Chemistry/Bio connections to math? BOOM IT MAKES SENSE. Relativity? Interesting! I am so excited for quantum mechanics after doing an intro course. 

Am now a geophysics major 😂"

The woman just kept insisting I was making shit up and my mom got her satisfaction of making me feel like shit for trying to tell someone about her. We never saw a therapist again. 

My advice - make sure it's not someone your mom already knows, call ahead and see if you can work something out about your mom getting yeeted out the meeting, and then explain your issue. Hang in there, I know it's a pain in the ass. They always over complicate everything and then it feels like everything - even the smallest things - are difficult to manage."

I agree with the rest, I only plan to talk to her through my attorney here on out. My attorney and I both thought though that it was a good idea to at least respond to her threat to remind her of her place + just to answer that bit there. Everything else is going through my attorney to hers."
legaladvice,fjds858,t1_fjdrvf0,1583258233.0,"Just in, apparently she sent this to my mom when she also texted me. Apparently she can't be cordial to me?

To mom: Hi. I just got a call from the accountant who is doing mom’s taxes. There has to be a separate tax return for the trust and she needs OP's SS#. Any possibility of your help? If not, will OP either give it to me or (if she doesn’t trust me) call the accountant herself with the number? It makes no difference to anything, but the return must be filed.


To me: If you chose not to respond, the taxes will be filed without your SS#, but with your name and address. There will be an attachment that you refuse to give necessary information. It won’t hurt me, but you will have to deal with the IRS, when they catch up to you. There is also information that you must include on your personal return. You want to be treated like an adult, so it’s time to act like one.


I'm just afraid she'll misuse my information. Wouldn't be the first time, considering in the letter too for family drama she flipped my words on me and used them out of context. 

And I see, yeah I don't think she's stealing it so much as just withholding it from me until I ""agree"" with her petty bullshit about the two items. To my knowledge though if I own half the estate, why am I unable to collect the items I want from it regardless? Should I have gotten a key to do this too or no?"
