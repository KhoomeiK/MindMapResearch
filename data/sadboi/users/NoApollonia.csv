They are two completely different human beings. I do think her mother should be the one disciplining her as it's clear the stepdaughter still has issues with your marriage to her mother."
fullhouse,fqttxef,t1_fqsa8a4,1589646041.0,"Though it is his house, I was kind of glad Danny didn't move back in. It would be a weird thing with DJ and Steph feeling they need to obey Danny's rules and not really feeling in power when it comes to DJ's kids. Plus honestly after all the vitriol Bob Saget had towards the role of Danny over the years, it makes watching the character really hard. 

I do agree they should have just had DJ and Matt marry early in S3 and just have Matt move in. DJ and Matt could easily share the master, Jackson and Max in their room, and Tommy in his. Kimmy and Fernando keep being back and forth and I was pretty cool with that - plus I think Kimmy feels she needs to stay by her promise to help DJ out. So maybe they could have not had Fernado by the Gibbler house. Since the writers really wanted the Stephanie having a baby storyline, they could swap and have Stephanie and Jimmy take the attic and then Kimmy and Fernando take the basement. It honestly would make more sense considering Kimmy runs her business from the house and out of her space and clients could just come in the back door and go straight down. It certainly makes more sense than dragging them up several flights of stairs and past all the bedrooms and whatnot. Ramona could simply just stay in her room as well.

The show is cancelled as of the last of S5 last I heard, but let's say if it had gotten continued, simply at a point move Tommy into the larger bedroom with Max and give Jackson Tommy's old room to himself, like DJ finally got her own room in the later seasons of Full House.

Edit: Not sure how much sense it would make, but hell if the show had went on, maybe Danny and Jesse buy the old Gibbler house. Then they would be nearby and Danny would likely want to repay Jesse's help with his kids by helping him with Pamela. Maybe even Joey could come to his senses, realize he hates his wife and kids (some crazy thing they all aren't his so we never see them again!), and also move in with Danny and Jesse."
fullhouse,fqs58m2,t1_fqs4qvv,1589598806.0,I honestly don't even like DJ all that much in Fuller House. She has a tendency of thinking she's perfect and making everything all about her. I almost think the show would have been better if they had started it with Stephanie and Kimmy moving in together to raise DJ's kids - maybe recast Michelle if the writers desperately needed it to be three adults in the house again. I wrote a [short fanfic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13477360/1/A-New-Start) for it if you want to see.
fullhouse,fqs3pnd,t1_fqs2t26,1589597819.0,"Well it's her furniture at least. I just meant we did see a glimpse of the room. I believe we saw more as Danny got out of bed, but took forever just to find that shot and I didn't feel like watching the episode to take my own screencaps."
fullhouse,fqs23le,t1_fqs1pjc,1589596805.0,"As for people who ended up with their high school sweethearts......I have to raise my hand here. But, we never broke up - we just stayed together and now we're in our 30's....so it's different than DJ and Steve's story. I don't feel high school romances work out unless they stay together - once they separate and get with other people, it's never likely to work out.

I mean I feel DJ is disrespecting her kids with the ""Steve's my soul mate"" BS she seems to spout constantly. So their dad was chopped liver to her? He was just a means to children or what? Or does she wish she didn't have the three boys and could restart completely with Steve?

Something that circles in my mind is when Joey brings the tainted donuts and everyone gets sick, Matt's the one who sticks around and takes care of DJ and the kids. We see Matt bond with the kids at different points and seemed ready to step into the stepdad role. Steve barely acknowledges them and only cares to get DJ back.

I agree with the Gia and Matt story line. It feels the writers thought ""well damn, we decided to go with DJ and Steve.....now what do we do with this extra guy?"" Hell Gia and Steve would have been a better pairing than Gia and Matt as they are both extremely immature."

fullhouse,fqrxrhh,t3_gjgd02,1589594158.0,I totally agree. It is so ridiculous for DJ and Steve to be together they had to make Matt's character a complete and utter jerk for awhile. DJ and Steve being endgame feels so extremely forced.

AmItheAsshole,fqrtjcf,t3_gkgffm,1589591585.0,"YTA You two agreed to order the food for dinner. You chose to have what is honestly a meal for most the second you got home and therefore weren't hungry at dinner time - this to me was selfish as you could have had a smaller snack. What is the kicker for me is you chose that it didn't matter she was hungry, all that mattered was that you weren't and that she could just wait until you wanted food again. Honestly 8pm is starting to get a little late to order food considering it could be easily an hour before it arrives. You could have simply ordered less for yourself if you weren't hungry and simply ordered it at least by the second time she asked."
