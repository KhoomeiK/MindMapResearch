The whole western aesthetics with the futuristic plot is a big part of what drew me in, so more typical futuristic looking stuff doesn't feel as worth it to wait 2+ years even if it might be even more work or at least as much for them.

She seems to be forcing Charlotte into doing what she wants and to me that seems like the most obvious example of Dolores being a bad person more than any killing of humans she might have done.

The timing really sucks but at least the interview can be pushed back more easily. I'm on a forum for people at all stages of the process and some already have had their visas issued and those last only 6 months and nobody knows what will happen now because they can't go to the country anymore and will probably need to re-do the whole interview, medical exam process and everything if they don't make some kind of exception. With the current administration's views on immigration, I really doubt they will. Plus there's like one embassy per country who does it (so like in my case, wherever you are in Canada, it's Montreal, that's it.) 

Everything sucks right now for so many people, but I'm in a relatively good situation compared to a lot of other future immigrants, people with kids, people with a lot more bills and precarious situation, etc. I'm really grateful and people who have been whining about things like oh no I can't get my videogame bug me lol.

At the end of all this, we'll know more on how the private sector vs the state did at the end, but so far my faith in the system is already very eroded. All these corporations owned by billionaires and millionaires not stepping up to help the state in providing a safety net for the people, I don't know.

This is AskDID of course so my answer is not that important, but the reason why I wanted to comment anyway is because I've been educating myself about DID a lot on and off over the years and one thing I looked up recently was if there was any chemical imbalance/psychotic disorder-types of features at all or not and I learned that there wasn't and that's what APs work on.

They live super remotely wayyy way back in the middle of nowhere, and I'm not interested in living there nor does it have much career opportunities for me aside from remote work or freelancing and I'm not interested.

I also worried about them never coming to visit me because they used to say they would never come abroad or fly planes, but they ended up doing it in recent years to go on holidays in the Carribeans and what not, so they've showed interest in visiting me in the US now when I'll be there so that's cool.

In the end, I'll still be able to see them on holidays which is how often I see them lol. We talk on Facebook to keep up with each other. 

The cost of travel seemed like a lot when I was younger, but it's really not that bad. That being said, being on the East Coast and US/Canada does help. I'd be more concerned about leaving the continent."
childfree,fja2gcu,t1_fja1kie,1583164970.0,"we actually are haha, atlanta area. I've been in a long-distance relationship with my fiance for like huh...close to 13-14 years something ridic like that but we met when I was in my senior year of hs and i wanted to do my education here and then get some work experience before going forward with all the immigration stuff so its FINALLY happening. they were always really accepting and understanding and never made my partner feel like he should get a local girl or anything like that (unlike my family *eyeroll*) 

I do imagine it'll start happening once we are married and living together, but I'm ready to be super unapologetic about it. I can always just say it's my culture lol, which I think it partly is. We really aren't big on marriage, taking your husband's name and traditional values like that much. 
That being said, my partner's cousin who has 2 kids told him he shouldn't buy a new car because he doesn't have kids or something? The implication being that he should save for them and a house instead or something. We just laughed about it."
childfree,fj9un4c,t1_fj92gel,1583160006.0,"I get the ""state of the world"" thing a lot more than judgement thing as well, and the last comment I had about children at all from some cashier lady (who carded me when buying a bottle of wine and told me ""oh I have a 30yo daughter too"" lol) was just like ""you should adopt, there are so many needy kids in the world!"" True, I'm really critical of the fact it's so expensive and hard to actually do for people who do want to adopt or have to because of health issues, but that's neither here nor there.

I'm not sure if it's a French and/or Quebec cynicism/secular kind of thing or if I've just been lucky so far. I feel like once I'm married to my Southern American fiance and settled there that this will start happening a lot more from his side of the family, but hey, maybe not. My mom has her one grand-kid so she's happy with that, and the rest of my family are all really cynical about the future and are more on the ""having kids is selfish"" clan than the opposite, so that's cool lol."
childfree,fj9sc1q,t3_fc4zk5,1583158368.0,"I'm sorry about the medical issue, although you seem to be coping with it well. You're normal even if you get passing thoughts about what it would be like to have children or not, especially if your peers are all beginning to have them. That being said, even without those issues, I think 24 is still quite young and even if it seems like others are, it's not always that wise to start that early for many reasons. I think it makes more sense to wait and have more stability in life, having experienced more and having stronger financial and personal foundations to start having a family, if that's what someone wants.

I'm glad this community being around is helping you with all that though, it's definitely an option and a good one, I agree :) I'm CF too, I'm only saying all that because I think it's crazy some people are made to feel like you SHOULD be having kids under 25.

LOONA,fj141ia,t1_fj06c61,1582912626.0,"Yeah, I don't think things going as they are would lead to anything more than the mid-tier (in SK) position Loona is at. Investing doesn't mean a buy out, and a buy out doesn't mean a merger. A subsidiary seems right. Actually incorporating a whole agency into yours takes a lot of time and money for not necessarily great results. 

I hope that if this happens, they fund and help BBC and Loona where and how they need it but don't mess up with what works already. SM gets their internationally successful GG, BBC and Loona gets to grow. Would love this to work out well and for everyone it to turn into a win-win situation for Loona, BBC, the fans and SM altogether.

Not convinced it will, but definitely hoping so."

unpopularkpopopinions,fj0nt4z,t3_fapkkj,1582904095.0,"Meh, isn't fetishizing at the core of fan culture? I think as long as you're realistic that it's fan service/not that deep/not a statement of wokeness/something you're projecting hard on idols or god forbid, actually push on them openly on social media and lives, in the comments and stuff like that, that it can just be lighthearted fun. Nobody is going to get hurt if you enjoy the idea of Idol A and B having a romantic relationship or whatever if you're respectful and quiet about it and don't go around screaming that IT'S CANON and OMG MY LGBT KINGZZZ YAAAS. There's limits to everything though, and obviously hardcore fetishizing and objectifying real people is never going to be ok, especially if it's clear there are LGBT or racial fetishization, sexual fetishisation and otherwise. In moderation, I think it's dishonest to claim most people are not interested in idols' lives, relationships, appearance, etc. Might be the case for some people, but I don't think most fans are in it solely for the music. 

It's definitely light hearted/skinship fan-service at best and queerbaiting at worse, though. I'm not disagreeing. My point is more that I'm more inclined to push the blame on the industry itself for encouraging that sort of thing than on people who enjoy something that's clearly being done on purpose. 

Although, what I do blame the fans for is the lack of understanding the cultural differences in terms of skinship and how it's more a representation of friendship and platonic affection than something romantic or sexual. Although some fan service is definitely created by and for members of that culture, I think it's also ifans' responsibility to be aware of cultural differences if they're going to be part of a fandom that originates from a different culture than their own. 

So in those cases, yeah, I blame fans for pushing the gay agenda on things that are not and possibly making idols uncomfortable or misunderstanding things to a point that it might reflect badly on them or make them feel like acting in a normal friendly way might be perceived differently and make them either not want to do it, or lead to their compagnies pushing them into it because the fans love it or whatever."

MLMRecovery,fiarrkc,t1_fi7qyxi,1582307127.0,"Do you think Avon wau back then was kind of a better deal for women or was it just as bad as MLMs are today? 
Avon is like the outlier to me because I'm from a really small rural area, and back in the 90s, this woman in town sold it. She was the only one, she didn't try to recruit anyone. She just distributed the little catalogues and you called her on the phone for orders and 
 she delivered it to your house. She probably wasn't annoying or shilling too hard because my mom hates door-to-door soliciting (even if it's for ok things like charity or local events because we are all socially anxious and it's a small town and everyone looks around your house and gossips lol) but she didn't mind the Avon Lady and I remember them just chilling around a cup of coffee. It definitely felt more like a ""normal"" sales job and we just affectionately called her Madame Avon (French-speakers).

It surprised me a lot when I learned Avon is an MLM in recent years because it always had that feeling of legitimacy to me and of not being scummy from that experience. It was back then though, before internet and hours away from any even medium sized urban areas. The prices were on-par with drug store and she did it for decades so I don't think it was bad financially for her back then too either. She had four daughters and husband worked so it was probably a side income, think she had another job too but not sure.

I think tupperware was similar too even before that, with it being the era of women being stuck at home and all that. 

I still wonder if that experience is an outlier though (or if I'm not aware of things behind the scene that might have been darker or more your typical shitty MLM soul-sucking shenanigans) or if that really what is was like back then for some people. I can't see it being good anymore though. Anything we can't get, even in remote areas where I'm from, would come from the internet as fast if not faster as something from Avon would and it's probably cheaper, heh...

(sorry this is long and a bit random, but I've been wondering about it a lot but don't really want to make a thread about it because it sounds like I think Avon is ok and that SOME mlms are fine but i'm not lol, this was 25 years ago and i fuckin hate MLMs)"
MLMRecovery,fiaqua2,t1_fi7p6t1,1582306618.0,"Do you think it's possible your husband could focus more on the personal training part of the job? I think not being satisfied with one's job and wanting to pursue something you're more passionate about can be ok, even if it takes a pay cut and takes time to grow, but 50% is a lot, especially if he's focusing on the MLM part of things which is rigged to be a failure no matter how hard you try. I assume you've discussed all that if you're on this sub. Do you think it would be possible to compromise between you two if there was more focus on that? Or is he really convinced of the whole get rich scheme and won't let it go? :/ Anyways, best of luck with all that. That sounds really rough. At least he has something else so I would try to use that aspect of it in the hope it opens his eyes."
changemyview,fiaputm,t3_f72mwc,1582306069.0,"The way I see it, it's a little in between. I think it's something natural to the human condition, which has existed in other cultures for a really long time through history and manifested itself in ways that were more or less acceptable in the society they were in, depending on a lot of factors. It's complicated because gender in itself is a social construct, so it's impossible to separate the symptoms from the external influences of society and its preconceived notions of gender expression, gender roles, the connection with sexual orientation, etc. 

Dysphoria is a disorder with ravaging symptoms, but in a society where transphobia wouldn't exist, then the ""disorder"" would be much less present and much less intense, I think?

I agree with you that the medicalization of gender dysphoria CAN help with access to support and resources for transition and life as a trans person in general. At the same time, it also weaponizes that condition and makes it vulnerable to more discrimination, because even if something is a disorder and not someone's fault, people will discriminate regardless (just need to look at disabilities, mental health, etc.) People will be ignorant at best and consciously choose to be discriminatory at worst. 

These things are not perfect comparisons, but something that's a bit similar to me is the neurodivergent movement. It's a good thing to raise awareness and to ""normalize"" neurodivergence as part of the human experience and to not just medicalize it and see it as something that needs to be *fixed* because it's inherently *wrong*, ie. a disorder. At the same time, some symptoms of neurodivergence CAN be pathological and affect quality of life and people need support. To such a person, it wouldn't be good to just tell them that what they are experiencing and suffering through is normal because that can lead to erasure. 

So...yeah I don't know if I'm expressing myself well or making sense. I feel disorder/not-disorder are too black and white labels. Again, I know the comparison isn't perfect and I believe gender dysphoria has a loooot more ties with society as a whole and the way it affects gender expression so I see it partly as a ""social disorder"", if such a thing exists. I think gender dysphoria would still exist because there's body dysmorphia involved as well and things like that which society doesn't have as much relation to, but I think there would overall be a lot less suffering in the trans community if we lived in some kind of society where gender norms weren't so strong or even existed at all. I know it's not going to happen in any of our lifetimes if ever, but it would be nice."
antiMLM,fiaof2k,t1_fiabglw,1582305222.0,"I said that in my original reply to this post, but basically, from influencers, it's their job and it's what you expect from them. (Unless they're shady and don't disclose but that's not how that's supposed to work and shouldn't, I'm glad the FTC and other agencies around the world are starting to rework laws about that.)

I see influencers (who act within the scope of the law and of good ethics) as an extension and new form of advertising. TV or print ads are (usually) not scummy because they are regulated and we KNOW they are trying to sell us something, which in itself isn't inherently wrong.

The whole concept of MLMs isn't to organically use mouth-to-mouth marketing, which again, isn't bad in itself. It's the pyramid structure and the whole financial exploitation that it brings and the abuse of the trust between people which turns willing and sometimes simply uneducated people complicit to the exploitation of that trust. 

If my friend is upfront about how ""hey if we eat there, I get points but it's pretty good"" and it actually is and they're just getting a small benefit from it, then that's fine. They wouldn't be taken advantage of by that restaurant, my friend isn't seeing me as a mean to an end nor pushing me shitty, overpriced food for some kind of benefit. 

A lot of the individual elements of these schemes aren't automatically all evil. Referrals can be ok, mouth-to-mouth can be ok, reward cards and things like that can be ok. It's the structure as a whole and all the other elements combined that makes them so exploitative and vile."
unpopularkpopopinions,fianem0,t3_f7aiql,1582304626.0,"That aside, I think it's okay to be happy or proud of idols for being ""woke"" in other ways, even if they're small things. I think what matters is that it's understood that they are small things and to not act like a small display or support for X or Y is revolutionary. An idol hinting that they support other orientations for exemple shouldn't be taken as them being a huge advocate, but not as them not caring enough to be super vocal about it either. We don't really know, and the industry + SK society's views on these issues and the expectations of idols' behaviors are all really complex issues. 

On the opposite end, it's also important to understand that they CAN'T always be vocal about things they might be much more passionate about in private. This can go both ways; acting as if one supports a cause they don't really do because it's good PR but not actually caring about it, or having to be quiet and lowkey about something you support because it stirs wave (ie. feminism, LGBTQ rights, etc.)

So in short, just use critical thinking and nuance in how you perceive idols' behaviors and how you decide what their actions mean...but we know that's surprisingly hard for a lot of stans lol.

(I'm not a full on BAN ALL PORN anti-porn activist or an anti sex-work and I believe sex workers need protection and support, not shame etc, but I disagree it's inherently woke. That's a different topic altogether and there's a lot of discourse on that. Won't get into it more than that but I still feel like I should say it because pet peeve heh)"
