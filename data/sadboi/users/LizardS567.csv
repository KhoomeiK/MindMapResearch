Everyone thinks I'm crazy for going to see horror movies and listening to scary stories because of my fear of the dark and need for a night light, but it's not often that I find something that actually scares me. I don't know if there is a correlation, it is interesting that some people who have been through terrifying experiences will seek out scary stories... kinda like when you're depressed and you listen to depressing music to make you more depressed??"

I think I can trust this lady, she would tell me if her food wasn't safe to eat. I find out from the internet, that all these sandwich places are completely cross contaminated. Poo poo on me for not doing the research first. But when my boyfriend confronted her about it, she said ""Yeah it's cross contaminated, but I'm not gonna change my whole restaurant for her."" I no longer trust a god damned word that comes out of her mouth (she's also been shady bout lots of other stuff).

Just be sure of which ones your professors can turn down. Also don't tell your professors what you have, all they need to know is that you have accommodations. I had a professor that I told about my illness and when he figured out I wasn't a genius that he could mold into gold he wanted nothing to do with me and treated me like I was stupid. Be careful!!

Hang in there, a thought that helps me get by is that the doctors are doing everything they can with what they have, and they wouldn't knowingly put me in harms way. It's going to be ok, maybe try finding some relaxation techniques that work for you between doc visits to put your mind at ease.
