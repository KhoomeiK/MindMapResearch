I had a moment of lucidity and did a bit of research and found a decent hospital. They only kept me for three days then booted me out- was back in two days then kept for 9 days. they got my meds straight and a good doctor lined up. It was a mental hospital (obviously) so it wasn‚Äôt all roses and bunnies, but it wasn‚Äôt traumatic like a lot of places In my area are. I was lucky. I‚Äôm glad I went. I still see the doctor they set me up with (2 years later. She‚Äôs the best) you‚Äôre making the right decision. Though they would literally not even talk to me if I didn‚Äôt admit I was going to hurt myself... (I‚Äôm in the US) I‚Äôm curious how you are managing that?"

Honestly, with all the color that‚Äôs already on there, you‚Äôre going to have to lighten it with lightener (only a level or two) and then put the desired brown on.

I recommend waiting it out until you get into a salon. Brad mondo does have some good videos on doing this at home but if it goes bad it‚Äôs going to get very bad. Just my 2 cents"

Which is something to be discussed during the interview, not on the resume. It sounds like he is managing it fine- which is great! So in my experience, I wouldn‚Äôt mention it at all. Unfortunately, there still is a big stigma on mental health and that is not going to go away soon. Don‚Äôt make it harder on yourself. 

Side note: get the job and go through a med change, have an episode, need time off to heal but didn‚Äôt tell them about your disorder before hand? This is 100% fine.
