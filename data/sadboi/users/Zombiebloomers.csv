BipolarReddit,fqs1kx3,t3_gkja1g,1589596497.0,"The last time I went in I signed my self in, terrible mix episode brought in by switching up too many medications too quickly (thanks ex doc) I had mild psychosis. Even then they wouldn’t take me in u til I admitted I had a plan to kill myself. 

I had a moment of lucidity and did a bit of research and found a decent hospital. They only kept me for three days then booted me out- was back in two days then kept for 9 days. they got my meds straight and a good doctor lined up. It was a mental hospital (obviously) so it wasn’t all roses and bunnies, but it wasn’t traumatic like a lot of places In my area are. I was lucky. I’m glad I went. I still see the doctor they set me up with (2 years later. She’s the best) you’re making the right decision. Though they would literally not even talk to me if I didn’t admit I was going to hurt myself... (I’m in the US) I’m curious how you are managing that?"

Besides bipolar2, I also have cptsd, mild ocd and generalized anxiety disorder. 

I feel most of my nightmares and insomnia come from anxiety and ptsd.

(Currently switching meds up so I can’t give you a baseline for that but if Info 😑)

Take as your doctor prescribes them.

beauty,fp7h8sb,t1_fp7gakh,1588370580.0,"Oh honey. I understand that ☹️ i would invest in a ashy brown that has a lot of ash. Something like 7AA. The extra cool in there will tone down the brass when applied. When lightening, try and apply it as quickly and thoroughly as possible (make sure you have it wet so it doesn’t come out uneven, take small sections) to attempt to get it to lift evenly (you have thick hair so maybe force a friend to help?) leave about 1/2 of the new growth out at first, heat of the head will process it faster. Try not to go too light- otherwise it could turn green when you apply the desired brown. I hope this helps? Lol. I’ll try and walk you through this best way I can! Oh and please don’t use box dye! That stuff is unpredictable as hell!

beauty,fp7f5ht,t1_fp7envt,1588369468.0,"Please don’t mix toner with the dye. 

Honestly, with all the color that’s already on there, you’re going to have to lighten it with lightener (only a level or two) and then put the desired brown on. I would not recommend doing this at home. You need a professional to do this correctly. Also, throwing a toner on thst with it being so dark is probably not going to do anything. I recommend waiting it out until you get into a salon. Brad mondo does have some good videos on doing this at home but if it goes bad it’s going to get very bad. Just my 2 cents"

2. I take ativan as needed. Though lately I have been taking it nearly everyday bc of things going on currently around the world and other life stresses. (For the anxiety) other than that, I take a lot of pepto. Tums don’t work as well on me.

Like op said, it’s none of their business as well as it is not something to boost about. The ONLY reason this should be discussed with an employer is if he needs reasonable accommodation  for it. Which is something to be discussed during the interview, not on the resume. It sounds like he is managing it fine- which is great! So in my experience, I wouldn’t mention it at all. Unfortunately, there still is a big stigma on mental health and that is not going to go away soon. Don’t make it harder on yourself. 

Side note: get the job and go through a med change, have an episode, need time off to heal but didn’t tell them about your disorder before hand? This is 100% fine. I’ve had to do this in two separate jobs and they have to accommodate you by law (reasonably). They usually do an FMLA. which is in place for just such reasons.
