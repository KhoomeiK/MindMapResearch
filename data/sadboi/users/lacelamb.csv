Showerthoughts,epudrd1,t3_bvwgx8,1559508103.0,"My female German Shepherd has known I was pregnant before I knew, all 3 times. She won’t leave my side. The third pregnancy I realized she was doing this again and I took a test and sure enough, positive! I do think dogs can sense things that we can’t. Also, my male German Shepherd started spraying in the house during my third pregnancy, he had never peed in the house before. We didn’t find out the sex of the baby (we had two girls already and wanted it to be a surprise), we suspected he could be marking the house because it was a boy. It was!"
Anxiety,eptsgvb,t3_bvxmtt,1559496675.0,Yes I do it all the time! Sometimes when I catch myself doing it I’m extra dramatic about it and let out an audible exasperated groan when I breathe out so it’s semi-funny instead of annoying. Sometimes :)

socialskills,ep5ovpz,t3_bu0edy,1559059025.0,Personally I’m trying to get away from Social Media platforms like FB and IG. I think they only exacerbate my social anxiety.
povertyfinance,eopvy1o,t1_eojexw5,1558777782.0,I’m in a similar position as OP and this advice has motivated me so much. Thank you.
Frugal,eoptfol,t3_brxc05,1558775228.0,"I meal prep lunch and dinner meat/carb every 4 days. I pretty much always cook veggies fresh to go in them cuz they taste better fresh, and they’re quick to cook (or eat raw, like salad). My breakfast is overnight oats, I do those 2 days at a time (takes like 2 minutes). I have egg whites and salsa with the cold oatmeal and I cook 3 days worth at once. I have 2 snacks that consist of: protein shake, 1/2 banana and 1TB natural peanut butter."
Frugal,eoprmgs,t1_eojo0a1,1558773528.0,"I started printing free cards online from American Greetings. I have a decent printer, bought a box of card-sized envelopes and some white card stock. I use my paper cutter to make the edges straight (rather than use scissors). 
If you want to buy a nice card, Costco sells multipacks of beautiful cards for much cheaper per card than individual cards at the grocery store."
Frugal,eopqeho,t1_eooguou,1558772384.0,I second this.
EatCheapAndHealthy,eolc3b9,t1_eojv0qu,1558668553.0,"I have this every day for breakfast. I add unsweetened vanilla almond milk, a dash of vanilla flavoring, and a teaspoon of Swerve sweetener. It’s delicious, like healthy cereal."
beyondthebump,eol82vh,t3_bs3uwr,1558666924.0,Do what feels right. You know what’s best for your baby.
