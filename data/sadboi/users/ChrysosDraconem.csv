I only got so far as to buying my ice cream since my self-esteem wasn't too good. I was chubby at the time. But boy do i regret not asking her socil media until now. I only pray I see her again.

BipolarSOs,f2dclwt,t3_dcsdq1,1570150732.0,"I think I can help. I am one of those kids who didn't know he was bipolar until I got an episode. When I did everyone was shocked and they found drugs in my system I honestly believe someone put drugs in my food or water cuz I don't do it and rarely if ever drink alcohol. Wounded up in the hospital being delusional and the docs thought it was just cuz of the drugs so they waited a couple of weeks for it to wear off. It wasn't it just triggered it I guess. After a month I was still in that psychosis state and for the next year and a half I was going in and out of the hospital. Thankfully through rehab, therapy, finding the right doctor, sheer willpower to try and get better and most importantly A family who never gave up on me even if other docs said I'd probably never leave the hospital. In a year and half I was let go and didn't come back excpet for check ups and therapy. Though it wasn't all sunshines and butterflies after. I considered just stopping to live and felt so ashamed of what happened and how my life before is gone. Those 6 months I was super depressed but after I finally srmtarted school again. Yeah there was alot of drama and close callss witbh highschool being dramaticðŸ™„. Fast forward and I'm in senior high and I'm doing alot better. This won't be easy but there's hope.
