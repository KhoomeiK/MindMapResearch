But there are not for profit online schools that are significantly more legit.  For example, WGU.  Non profits are more legitimate because, since they don't make money for shareholders, they have no motive to churn through students at any cost.  They are also significantly less expensive.

I got my masters through WGU and know quite a few others who got they undergrad and graduate degrees with them.  I reccomend looking into it if you can.  None of us have ever had issues getting hired or been questioned about it by employers.  Nonprofit online schools are regarded similarly to state schools.  Not prestigious, but not trash.  Many for profit schools also offer ""degrees"" which are not actually accredited, so your credits aren't transferable and that's another reason they're poorly regarded - there's no oversight or regulation for unaccredited programs guaranteeing that the curriculum meets educational standards that other universities are held to.

The way FSAs work, whether for medical, childcare, or transit, is that you essentially ""pledge"" to contribute a certain amount over the year and then you get access to that money immediately.  So even if you have only contributed $100 of a planned $1200, you can still spend $1200 right away.  The flip side of this is that if your account is cancelled, you immediately lose access to it and any funds unspent that you've contributed thus far.  If you had spent more than you had contributed, you also wouldn't be required to pay it back.

Frequently you have until the end of the calendar month that the account was cancelled to use it.  You would need to check with your plan administrator.  Even if the card itself is cancelled, you would be able to pay and then submit a request for reimbursement.

The assumption would be if you took possession of the property and there were issues, including cleanliness, then you would bring them to the attention of the landlord and have those issues remedied.  Some jurisdictions have more specific requirements surrounding walkthroughs, but not all.  If you leave a property a mess and the landlord has to clean it prior to new tenants moving in, and you never notified the landlord when you moved in that cleaning was needed, barring other statutes or provisions in your lease, the fair assumption is that you didn't leave the property in the same condition that you received it."

Insist your landlord provide appropriate documentation within the 30 days (feel free not to remind them and see if they hang themselves) but consider it may be a fight to recoup anything if they want to make it difficult.

legaladvice,fphhnzo,t3_gdhafr,1588621455.0,"Did your car actually get towed?  If not, there's nothing to be done here, as you have no damages or anything.  

As far as is it ""legal"" notice, it's not exactly a legal issue.  It's probably not realistic to search through every lease and look up every license plate number to locate the owner to notify directly.  If your lease doesn't specify that you will be notified in a specific way, then your notice is actually the lease itself, telling you your vehicle will be towed if you allow the tabs to expire (or whatever other conditions apply) and the paper on the windshield is just a courtesy.  It's your responsibility to not violate your lease.  It's easy to lose track of little things like this, but it sounds like (barring another specific provision in your lease) your landlord did you a favor by posting the note and giving you an opportunity to avoid the towing inconvenience."
legaladvice,fphfktu,t3_gdgs0p,1588620403.0,"Agreeing to end the lease early doesn't mean that the rest of the provisions aren't in effect.  

Nothing you described would count as wear and tear.  If it could be resolved by cleaning (dirt/calcium build up) then it is the tenants responsibility unless it was in that condition when you took possession of the property AND you documented that in your walk through.  Otherwise, the tenants responsibility is to return the property in the same or better condition than they received it.  Cracked tile also doesn't sound like normal wear and tear unless we're talking something minor like tiny hairline cracks.  If, for example, its cracked because something heavy was dropped, that's damage, not wear and tear.  As for the storm door, unfortunately if the damage being claimed wasn't documented by you as preexisting when you took possession of the property then you're probably out of luck.  (But if it's a piece of tape can that not just be... taken off?)

If applicable law is that your landlord has 30 days to provide a list of damages to you or the deposit has to be returned, and it's been more than 30 days and you haven't received that, then all that is a moot point.  You may have to take your landlord to small claims court to recoup your deposit however, if they refuse to do so."

I frequently liken having a mental illness to something like diabetes in that it takes lifestyle changes, medication, and work to stay healthy.  If a diabetic doesn't take care of themselves it's the same concept.  You need to see the right doctors and practice the right self care or there is consequences.  Obviously it's not exactly the same, but there IS an aspect of responsibility.  When people with any health issue CHOOSE not to do what they need to do, then the consequences are to some extent the result of their actions.  And that includes mental illness and being an asshole.

I'm in the r/bipolarreddit community and we hear from partners and friends of bipolar people all the time trying to figure out how to help them and wanting relationship advice. Sometimes the advice we have to give is that their partner is not being responsible with their illness and that they shouldn't put up with being treated the way they are.

After I was diagnosed my mom and sister were talking about mental illness and people who claim they have it but surely they don't!  My mom talked about a friend she had who was REALLY bipolar, so she knows what it looks like.  She described his manic episodes and depressive episodes and yes, it was clear that he suffered from it.  It sounded severe and poorly managed.  But you see, that's how she knew that some people who said they had it didn't, because they weren't as severely affected as him.

I decided then and there I would never tell my family.  I (thought) I had hidden it quite well from my family. I definitely didn't want that kind of judgment.  Someone who faked a mental illness for attention.

A couple years went by and I struggled with meds and mild episodes but was doing ok.  Frankly it's always a struggle to stay stable and I wished I had more people to support me and wished I could tell my family that the reason I bailed on my nephew's birthday party was because I was sick from new meds or in a depressive episode, but was too afraid they wouldn't understand.  Then my mom came to stay with me for a few months after she recovered from surgery.  We got a lot closer spending all that time together and she talked to me about her struggle with depression. I decided to open up and asked her not to tell anyone else, but that I was bipolar.

She didn't even blink.  She said she understood, we talked about it, she didn't question it.  A few months later I said something about how no one in the family probably had suspected it and she lovingly informed me that they had all speculated for years that I was bipolar. (Its pretty hard to hide when you're in an episode and not totally in touch with reality.)  I'll admit, part of me does not understand why no one said anything and tried to reach out and help me if I was obviously struggling, but this is just my family, not a group of medical professionals, so I can't really blame them for not knowing what to do.

I sent my sisters and email telling them, telling them I was in the middle of adjusting my meds and struggling and could use some extra support.  I had a conversation with my little sister that significantly repaired our long broken relationship.  My older sister understood when I missed a family event and was fine with me doing something low key at another time.  It changed a lot and the support system I have now has been a huge help.

That said, my brother doesn't know and none of us will tell him.  We all love him to death but he in particular has zero empathy or understanding herb it comes to mental illness (that's not to say he doesn't have sympathy).  He very much thinks you can just ""choose"" to be happy or things like that.  Kind of similar to ""just eat!""  And there's nothing wrong with deciding to limit who you tell.

Anyways, I know you've gotten a lot of messages and such.  I thought my story might be one more encouraging one to read.  Telling my family is one of the scariest things I've done.  It was worth it.  Sometimes people surprise you."

I had a suspicion after coming across some info about bipolar when I was researching depression.

Your daughter is young though, and religious or not doesn't really have the life experience to fully grasp all of this.  She (I assume) hasn't had to choose between paying rent and paying for groceries.  She hasn't had to look at a job at taco bell for minimum wage and decide to either take that and still not be able to pay the bills versus ""degrading"" herself by letting people *gasp* see her naked.  And it is wonderful she has never been in that place and she is young and naive.

I agree this is tough because her doctor is refusing to do the test, but that doesn't mean her employer is required to let her come back from a legal standpoint.  One option might be for her to ask her doctor to write a note explaining the test is not being administered because she has had no contact with a corona patient and therefore is not considered at risk to having contracted it.

Your best option here is to talk to your dad and tell him why you don't want to go.  Contacting CPS is also an option but they wouldn't likely be able to show up at your house to start an investigation tomorrow.  Your dad would need to make it clear to your mom that he is not preventing you from going and that it is your choice in order for him to be protected legally from the charge of violating the custody agreement.  I know that's a lot to ask you to take on, but you also need to stand up for yourself and you deserve to be comfortable and safe.
