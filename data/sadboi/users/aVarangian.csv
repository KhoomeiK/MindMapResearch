There are some different types. There may also be other unrelated causes, like sleep apnea, thyroid problems, etc, but afaik such potential unrelated causes are supposed to be checked for if one is being looked at for hypersomnia. 

The main point of my previous comment though is that it's not normal to be too tired and/or sleepy and it should definitely be looked at. Unfortunately it's easy to think nothing of it, particularly if one has had it for a long time or if the onset has been gradual.

Games are generally much cheaper for PC as well. (And I'm not talking about grey market, which btw is rarely better than legit deals)


> Yet a lot of games perform better on console    

you have to compare equivalent specs. In my case I need a PC even if not for gaming (who doesn't?), a 750Ti is slightly better than a PS4's GPU, so at the time I built a PC I could get PS4-tier graphics for less than half the price, and that's before overclocking it (which was like a 20% boost)."
