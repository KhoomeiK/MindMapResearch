1. Just tell the truth. Tell him you can't do this much longer because of your own reasons. You have to leave early or it's costing too much gas. etc. Say you will give him one more free ride to give him 'time' to figure it out. Doing this, you will still show consideration.
2. Keep saying that you can't until he gives up. But that can lead to awkward moments or even he confronting you about it. In either way, you will always be in the right. Since he has no business confronting you about it in the first place. It's a free ride after all!
3. Simply say 'no'. Say you can't or won't. But this might lead to things breaking up between you too. And since he is a coworker, that might not be a nice idea.
4. Ask a compensation in return. If could be money or material stuff. You have the right to ask that. If he doesn't agree, just say you can't give him rides no longer.

At the end of the day, you ended up in Reddit asking for advice. Which means that it's not just a casual disagreement, but a problem that is already disturbing your peace and might slowly build up. Either way, the outcome may be not positive. You should be prepared to accept that too. Good luck.

First, don't fight your wife. Because at this stage of pregnancy, she will be vulnerable. You should be there to support her. Baby is coming, so her mental preparation has already begun. She needs you more than ever before.

Secondly, I would try to sit with her and have a \*normal\* conversation. About things. But be aware! If there \_is\_ something up between them, you shouldn't confront her right now with it. Too much stress and drama. Have the baby first. It's gonna get born anyway!

Thirdly, try to find out why your neighbour had to borrow your toolbox. Why a toolbox? Most of the time you borrow one specific tool. And find out what he borrowed for and how the toolbox is being useful for. Try to fish any signs of emotions (like surprise or fear, stress, adrenaline etc.) and read his body language. Also listen to his voice tones during each answer.

Fourthly and finally, I would DEFINITELY tell his wife. But not in a vengeful manner, like there is something up. You could be creating  unnecessary drama. Just bring it up during a conversation. And see how \_she\_ reacts.

Good luck"
