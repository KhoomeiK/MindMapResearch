AskUK,fr4m54a,t3_gm7cvf,1589891949.0,"I get Year 6s going back but I can't reconcile sending back the youngest kids first (especially when those still under 5 can't be tested even if they do develop symptoms). It's difficult because I do understand how important these years are for laying a foundation for their learning and social development. But both Reception and Year 1? When those will be the hardest year groups to socially distance? Classrooms just don't have the space for it. You'd need to pull staff from other year groups which could affect their teaching. 

I have some friends who teach in those year groups that are working all hours of the day, live streaming lessons for the kids in their class, constantly reworking their plans and resources for online learning, in the middle of writing reports. They care deeply for the kids and miss them but there are safety concerns. Some of them have family members they live with who are more at risk, so it's not that simple. They'll be expected to go in because there are going to be teachers who are high risk themselves. Even shuffling the year groups around brings some level of disruption. Either way, some kids are gonna miss out if their parents aren't sending them to school due to safety concerns or having a family member in a high risk group. I do think (bar Year 6) they're better off opening in September when things have had more of a chance to calm down. At a push maybe Year 6 and Year 1 because all of these kids are able to be tested. They'll have more space and they'll need less staff."

This is what's stressing me because until they start when can we be recruited? As long as the offers aren't getting rescinded they'll be okay.

Work's still piling up so they changed their mind and are starting the April lot in July now, but they still don't intend to reinstate the September offers just yet.

I think it’s a combination of the factors you’ve mentioned. There are no restrictions based on what you studied at A-Level or degree level so you definitely get a wide range of applicants. I can understand that the UCAS points provide a more standardised way of differentiating and excluding candidates as well.

It’ll be in addition to a degree, where most will ask for a 2.1. Sometimes there will be GCSE requirements too. Some are ridiculous in that they insist on 300 UCAS points and a 2.2 degree minimum but if you have a 2.1 and exceed the GCSE requirements with 280 points then no can do. 

Not every firm will have these requirements - the larger firms bar KPMG seem to be easing up but these places are far more competitive. I’d imagine mid-tier firms hold on to the requirements as a means of cutting down on applicants."

It doesn’t matter that I exceed the requirements in other areas. My degree and experience don’t matter. 20 bloody points. It’s wild how one particularly bad exam I took when I was 17 is what it takes to deem me worthless. I already had to take over an extra year to finish my degree due to these mental health issues, so the feeling that I’m wasting my life and forever lagging behind will not leave me alone, especially when I am limited in what I can actually do to fight back against that.

Likely to spend at least the rest of the year feeling like more of a failure. All that yammering is to say that you’re not alone in this - though I know that won’t necessarily make you feel better.

Even graduating in the first place given what you’ve gone through is an achievement and during the job search it can be difficult to remember that but that doesn’t make it untrue. 

You are certainly not worthless without a job. This definitely isn’t the time to make that judgement of yourself (not that it would be true at any other time). Competition will be high especially now even for things like retail or supermarket jobs. It’s definitely not a reflection on you - but I would keep going with those applications just in case.

I’m still waiting on a direct response from them - they’ve made very clear that they intend to use the use the scheme for people who are salaried and keep emphasising how much they care, but nothing about zero hour staff yet. I just hope bad timing doesn’t mean I get hung out to dry."
UKPersonalFinance,fndrmqw,t1_fndbbpw,1586876177.0,"Yeah that doesn’t seem right. As far as I know since you started a new job in February, you’d be paid pro rata based on the hours you had done rather than your contracted hours? So if you had been working full time you should be getting 80% of what you would earn if you were still working those hours."

jobs,fmy8ygd,t3_fy2z9o,1586480699.0,"It depends on what you want to do really? Requirements for things like grad schemes that I’ve come across tend to concentrate on having a 2.1 in any degree and/or 300 UCAS points (I think that’s 120 new style), with some slight variation depending on the employer. Some may just have a degree classification requirement. Nothing about whether or not the uni is a Russell Group. Smaller companies offering jobs rather than schemes might put a little more stock in it. 

Media and Communications is still relatively broad - it wouldn’t matter so much if you were looking to work your way up from being a production assistant after uni but I’d imagine it would matter a lot more if you wanted to be a journalist. If the rest of your offers are Russell Group I would err on the side of picking one of them."
UKPersonalFinance,fmwgjdp,t1_fmvuu5b,1586446183.0,"My office did something like that - we’re not a college but everyone on a salary got their pay temporarily cut to 80% so it doesn’t make a difference if they’re furloughed or not. They are trying to make it so that most people are furloughed at one point or another so it’s not like there’ll be a bunch of people left to work for less while others sit at home. Does your workplace intend to do something similar?

They shouldn’t allowed to cut your pay without your permission though?"
UKPersonalFinance,fmwf7de,t1_fmvf5xu,1586445498.0,"Good luck, hopefully it won’t come to that. There are loads of people in your position - have you seen the #newstarterfurlough hashtag? The pressure is building so I do hope they come up with a better solution for you guys"

UKPersonalFinance,fmt7fh7,t3_fx3xb5,1586368065.0,"Do zero hour employees have any recourse if their employer decides not to furlough them? 

I'm already guessing the answer is no. I currently have a zero hour contract at my job and was due to be promoted into a salaried role, that offer has since been put on hold (which isn't uncommon, I get it). I was on holiday/unpaid time off for a few weeks and in that time the office closed down and everyone else started working from home. When I got back and wanted to get back to work that's when I was told there wasn't work for me... then later there might be work for me (but it'd probably be a significant reduction in hours, much less than 80% of what I'd normally make, closer to 20% if that). I have enquired about whether officially furloughing me is an option but I haven't heard anything back... just at a loss for what to do as I live with parents and they're still working so I don't even know what that means for UC."

solotravel,fkc75tb,t1_fkb6vfw,1584047119.0,100% agree. Having more than one megathread whether it’s based on the type of issue or divided into regions would help massively. Having legitimate discussion shut down and sent here to be mixed in with other irrelevant topics isn’t that useful. Honestly I know it isn’t r/CoronavirusTravel but it’s having a big impact on travel so if it has a temporary impact on the sub so be it.
solotravel,fkaj43z,t1_fkadbfb,1584010146.0,Honestly I do get a bit irritated when things that seem to warrant their own thread get shut down with “direct this to the megathread”. I do get that if they don’t do it then the sub becomes overrun with coronavirus content but there has to be a happy medium between that and a megathread that lasts for weeks on end with no real organisation to it? Megathreads for specific regions (even if they’re grouped together) might be cool?
solotravel,fkaivaf,t1_fkagq14,1584009873.0,I’m in Thailand now with plans to travel through Malaysia soon with a group. I have no idea what to expect but I’m gonna go ahead with my plans until the world changes them for me. Restrictions do not feel as heavy here as they seem to be at all in the West atm. These things can change in an instant though. For some reason staff at hostels that I’ve come across in Cambodia and Thailand are concerned only if you’re coming from like China/Singapore??? I don’t even know what to tell you man.
solotravel,fka84ha,t1_fka5ujr,1583996184.0,I feel exactly this way about some countries in SEA right now. It might be a case of fudging figures. It might be a case of not testing enough or maybe not having the means to test as much as other countries - but I am very sceptical of current figures coming out of e.g. Cambodia and Thailand. Hopefully things are closer to the reported figures than my brain is having me think though.

Masks are affordable-ish for tourists but some locals have been priced out of being able to buy them (they’ve gone from like 2000 VND to 20000+ VND) which sucks. You might need a couple masks to visit some places (was asked to wear one in certain places in Hanoi). Vietnam was the first place to successfully contain SARS when it broke out I think? They’re also offering to cover cost of treatment if you end up with COVID-19 (idk if that applies to tourists - but at the very least it’ll encourage people to get themselves checked out if they think they could have it). You should be fine here."
solotravel,fiqw2ts,t3_f9b5ti,1582652699.0,"I guess it depends on what you’re haggling for. There’s a video somewhere of a woman that got chased on a mountain in Nepal because she tried to haggle on a cup of tea that was something like $1. I’d pay for something like that or a bottle of water on a mountain without bartering because at that point the difference is literally pennies. Why bother?

Clothes/electronics/souvenirs in markets you should definitely haggle for especially when you see the same things at multiple stalls. I feel it’s best to probably stay above 50% of the price though depending on where you are. I don’t see a problem with using bargaining power in a group on say a tuk tuk around Angkor Wat or massages or something either."
