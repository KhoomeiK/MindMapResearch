TwoXChromosomes,fqihlm1,t3_gipkyg,1589396102.0,"Something like that happened with my first boyfriend but he has never apolagized. He never forced me, of course, but I used to have anxiety attacks bc of the pressure he put me on. The thing that I think is my fault is that, two year after we broke up, idk how, I realized that the pressure he put me on wasn't normal so I blowed up and I started to put a lot of bullshit about him on twitter. He saw that and talked to me privately and basically told me that I was crazy. i know i shouldn't have put those things on twitter and i should have talked to him but 1. he wasn't treating me well even 2 years after the breakup (we shared a group of friends so we used to see each other) 2. i suffer from anxiety already so sometimes I'm very impulsive and I go in like manic episodes or something, I don't know. The thing is that, I get very nervous and I only focus on the misfortune that is happening to me and that made me unable to stop telling everything he did to me on twitter. I know it's wrong, but what really hurt and killed me inside was that he didn't admit  doing anything. And I'm not saying that I wanted him to admit it in front of everyone, but I wanted him to admiit to me, I just asked him for that. Even so, he said something like ""I know that now you're having a bad time and you don't see things clearly, but don't tell lies about me"" ok, I understand that I shouldn't have put that on social networks but don't lie to me."

I've been told by two doctors that it's just mental and all of that stuff but I can swear that this is not entirely mental.  It happens to me since my first relationship (16 years old) until today (20 years old) and it is very frustrating.  Sometimes I can't even masturbate.  Unfortunately, lately I've been feeling more pain than ever and now it is becoming more mental because, damn, I don't want to suffer that pain.  I want to enjoy sex.  As I have read, you have to find a gynecologist specialized in pelvic pain or vulvodynia.  I was looking for one these last weeks but obviously with the quarantine, I'm going to have to wait.

Hi. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and we spend almost every day of the year together. We don't live together but we live very close. Now with this quarantine we can not see each other (someday I run away to spend an hour at his house but that has only happened once since the quarantine began and now the government is stricter about that so) and the truth is that I am very very very sad. We do not have an unhealthy dependency relationship, I have many things to do by myself and I enjoy them alone, but he is my life partner and I miss doing things with him very much. And I have to say that he's my biggest support and he has always helped me with my anxiety and my depression episodes. Honestly, many times we are together but we are not doing the same thing, I mean, I am doing one thing on my own and he also does his things but we are in the same room, we look at each other, we kiss each other sometimes, we support each other even in silence ! And I know that there are people with bigger problems than this, but really, he is part of my family and I can't stop crying just thinking about the time we are going to be apart. I never thought in my life that a global pandemic was going to separate me from the love of my life."
