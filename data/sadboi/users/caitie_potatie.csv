Yet really I was just seeing what I wanted to see.

 I know originally I only clipped (and razored) for a vanity thing and I was following a trend because eveyone else did it. The winners did it so I needed to too and it was just an endless cycle until today. 😁

Newsflash, they look just as beautiful with them left on. 

Their whiskers are just a fraction of their presentation and do not affect their conformation. My girl still won her head class and everything too as the only horse there with a hairy nose (and ears). :)"
