Here's what I would do...
Sit down with your favorite tea or hot chocolate and PLAN.   You will get through the holidays... they don't have to be perfect.

Using your phone, your bullet journal, iCal... whatever you are comfortable with, start filling in events you don't want to miss.  Go in order; and don't try to do the entire holiday season... maybe just deal with Thanksgiving Day for now.

Write down what you're supposed to bring and what you're planning to wear.  (If you have kids add theirs in as well).  Get all of it ready so you can clear your mind of small details that don't matter.  (And by get it ready I mean out of the closet and lay it out with belt, socks, accessories, etc.  Don't leave any surprises for tomorrow.)

Now you can start enjoying seeing your family.  Don't let this ruin your favorite stuffing or the traditional games you play every year.  Your happiness is the priority right now.  Not his.  Enjoy yourself as much as you can and really try to be thankful for what you do have... fabulous girlfriends, great job, lovable dog, etc 

And perhaps you should take a minute to imagine NOT spending next year with your husband.  Eight years of broken promises and four years of no sex?  Nothing is going to change in this relationship.  Ask yourself if you want to spend another year exactly as the past one.  Only you can answer that.

Good Luck"

marriageadvice,ezaj63w,t1_ezaf5jc,1567802478.0,"Oh, that must have hurt to hear  : (

Sometimes the whole ""let's have date night"" can just be too much pressure.  I don't want to come home from work and then work on my marriage too.  It can be overwhelming.

I would try instead to do little things for her... if you know she hates it when you leave junk mail by the front door then don't leave it there.  If you know she loves taking baths, clean the tub for her and make sure you don't use all the hot water..  Make it easy for her to do something she LIKES.  Something that will make her smile.  

Help her find the things that DO make her happy... A great idea would be to sit down with her over a glass of her favorite coffee/wine/tea and make her think about what makes her happy and is satisfying to her.

I was depressed and having trouble in my marriage (and still am), but sitting down and trying to find ME and what made me happy was really useful.

Hope this helps..."
marriageadvice,ezaewdb,t3_d0ln3c,1567800166.0,"Does she specifically say she's unhappy with the relationship you have together or is she depressed?  Upset with career progress or her family?

What's the root of the problem?  Does she know?  Can she verbalize it?"
marriageadvice,ezaebwn,t1_ez88zch,1567799873.0,"No, I didn't think ""dead beat dad"" at all.  But when only one parent lives with such young children the entire experience is harder on EVERYONE.

Image your wife with a baby who's sick... how much patience does she have left for your older daughter?  How stressed is she?  How much does she have left in the tank when she's a single mom?   Why would you want that?

You physically being there (as long as you're not actively fighting) gives both of you more patience, love and understanding for BOTH of your children.  Raising little ones is not easy... and sometimes it's not fun.  But if the two of you can help each other get through it, your children will be better off for it.   

And like I said, it's not forever.  Don't ""stay together for the kids"" until college. That doesn't help either.  But if you really need to leave because she's not the one for you, you do it when your children are older... at least when both are out of diapers... when they aren't so fragile and demanding.  Don't make it harder on their mom to raise them with love and kindness.  Try to make it easier."

Until your children are older, you don't get to be selfish.  You should have figured yourself out before now.  You decided to have children too young.  And that's not their fault.  

That isn't to say that you should stay in a marriage that is unhappy or abusive.  But you stay until your newborn is in kindergarten... or pre-school at the earliest.

And here's the hard part.  You have to stay happily.  You have to decide to be happy.  If things aren't meeting your expectations, lower your expectations.  Have a sense of humor and decide that you are LUCKY.  You will get over this... but your children won't get this time back.

Be the guy with the dad jokes and bask in the love your children are going to offer you... and don't take it all so seriously."

It's been different things over the years.  From Legos and cartoons to reading the same books or training the dog together.  We always had at least one thing that we did together.  The last thing was D&D... but that's gone too.

marriageadvice,excfhtf,t3_crwg8p,1566149521.0,"I think you're doing well to recognize what the problem is and you want to fix it.  You've already come a long way.  Remind yourself of how far you've come and focus on the next step.

Right now, it seems like that next step is going to be starting a job in September.  Keep that front and center in your mind.  Prepare NOW for it.  Find the appropriate attire, shoes, lunch bag, etc., and get a bus pass or coordinate your carpool/gas expense etc.  Come up with a plan (and a sponsor) of how you're going to deal with stressful situations at work.  You don't want to relapse.

It seems to me you can't really deal with your husband while you're staying at your brother-in-law's house.  So don't focus on your marital relationship; focus on being parents first.  Don't get pulled into arguments or spend any of your mental energy on your husband.  Spend it on finding the pathway for your girls to return.

Then, after September and the job, pick a new short-term goal.  How soon can you have your girls visit you?  How soon can you establish your own apartment?  Can you find subsidized housing for the four of you?  Concentrate on being the loving, responsible mom you WANT TO BE.

I think you need to focus on the the ""mom"" side of yourself and then look at the ""wife"" side of you later.  If he has any problems with that, tell him honestly (based on your 23 years together), that both of you should focus on getting clean and STAYING clean for your children... you marital problems can be dealt with in the coming months.

Good luck 🤗"

marriageadvice,ex0ovjr,t3_cqthku,1565918521.0,"TL;DR (Vent Session) Me (50F) and my DH (53M) of 30 years seem to have the same fight over and over.  It's never going to change.  But I have to stay for our teen..

As stated, this is a vent session.  A list of things I want to get straight... Just in case we do end up going to therapy.

I'm so irritated that I've told him repeatedly (over the years) that I'd like to feel more desired or wanted in our relationship.  I know that passion fades, but I've told him (again, repeatedly) that this really bothers me.  I feel like we're roommates most of the time.  I would like to feel like we're still lovers.  

I'm not looking for grand gestures.  I've told him i don't need him to plan elaborate date nights or send me flowers... I'm just talking about receiving a bit of male attention.  An appreciative glance in my direction.  An acknowledgement that I'm a woman.  

But what happens is I tell him this, and he says ""Oh, you know I love you babe.""  So I am the one who still ends up feeling unloved, unseen, and unattractive.  I am the one who is dying to have sex.  (But I'm so tired of initiating that I vow the very next time he barely LOOKS at me, I'll be ready to go.  Still waiting after three weeks).

Time passes and I'll bring it up again (this happens repeatedly) and I'll tell him that this is the one thing that I really NEED.  I can't control what I need...  I CRAVE attention from him.  Is there any way you could give me a little bit of flirtatious attention?  Some tiny gesture that could convey attraction?

I finally brought it up again (before the pity sex situation three weeks ago).  And for the first time he told me that I get this way ""every couple of years"" and he just ignores it.  Cause eventually I'll get over it.

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

He has seen this as a pattern in our marriage and he couldn't examine why I ask for the same thing!?  ""She'll get over it"" is your answer?  He doesn't try to change at all and I'm left feeling empty.

He is seriously using that as an excuse to not do the MAIN thing I asked.  He's probably thinking reasons like ""She's depressed.  I wish her meds would get her feeling better...
""She's dealing with her family right now...
""She's had too much to drink...""
""She's bipolar...
""She's whining...
""I can't believe what she's saying.""

But where does that leave me?  I'm the one who's sad. I'm the one who doesn't feel loved in the relationship.  

I'm also the one that can't leave over something so silly and minor.  I'm not being abused.  I'm not a victim of anything.  In fact I've been supported physically, mentally, and in every way he knows how.  But he can't or won't do this. 

Which makes me think he has no desire for me at all. (That he may have NEVER have had any desire for me).  

In a recent discussion about it... (A third conversation; never done before.). He said he's in it for the long haul and isn't going anywhere... then he insinuated that I am too horny for my age.  He said he didn't want to have sex everyday.

I was so humiliated.  I was completely mortified.  I felt so old, ugly and shocked that he would say that.  He made me out to be Mrs. Roper.  (70's TV show ""Three's Company).

And I refuse to be put in that role.  I will leave him before I'll allow myself to be shamed like that.


I know his love language is ""acts of service."" He cooks for me, shops for me, picks up my prescriptions, drives our teenager back/forth to school.  He's funny, smart and the best person I've ever met.  When I think of how petty I'm being I am truly ashamed.  How could I let him do so much for me?  How could I let him take care of me and spoil me... and then talk about needing more?

I feel awful that he does so much for me.  I don't deserve it.  And I don't want to take advantage of him.  I would never want to do that to him.

I don't know if I should try to fix it or just accept it.  And if I just accept it, how do I not feel like I'm allowing him to think everything is fine?  

It's not fine.  

It's not okay to accept all of his ""acts of service"" when I'm really planning on leaving after high school graduation for our teen."

He needs to develop new tricks : )
New techniques, new positions, new rhythms. And he doesn't have anyone to ""practice"" on.  

He's not 18 anymore, so he's not forgiven for being a little jumpy... and he certainly doesn't have the stamina to perform like an 18 year old. 

You have to approach this together.  Whether he wants to or not.

One way would be to leave him a book, article or YouTube that describes something NEW that you find sexy.  It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's in his comfort zone.  Try it out together.

Keep trying and experimenting together and you'll grow closer and fix the orgasm ratio.
