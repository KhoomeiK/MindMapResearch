Anxiety,fpz408u,t3_gg4jsd,1589013297.0,"Try focusing on finding purpose and meaning in everyday. I noticed similar feelings and once I made an agreement with myself to take the plunge on a serious career change I've been putting off for a year or so, I started waking up more relaxed. The best way I can put it is like I was experiencing existential terror about having to face another day. Once I found more meaning in my life this faded and I actually look forward to the future again. Don't know if this is helpful but I hope it is."
Anxiety,fpz2tie,t3_gg88vr,1589012777.0,"To be honest I would say there's no shame in quitting. That's okay too. There's other work out there, no use killing yourself to make a living. This whole situation is hard enough as it is. Maybe have a conversation with your dad about focusing on moving out after all this madness is over. He's housed you for your whole life probably, 6 months more shouldn't break your relationship with him."
Anxiety,fpz2iai,t3_gg4129,1589012568.0,"What helps me sometimes is remembering that it's okay to let go. It's okay to relax. Forgive yourself, and remember some things are out of our control. Trust yourself to roll with the punches, how many times before have you come out on top? How many difficult times and problems have you conquered before?"
Anxiety,fpz1jlz,t1_fpudhvv,1589011839.0,"I feel like the term mentally ill in our society carries this unspoken attitude of permanence unlike most other illnesses. Like if you become mentally ill you will never get better and it carries this heavy life sentence. I also feel like this is because mental health is just beginning to be really understood, and the best we can do most of the time is throw prescriptions at it. It's pushed me to make a lot of lifestyle changes to combat it, and I've noticed a slow but sure positive change. It's really a shame how little is understood about mental health considering it's so important."
Anxietyhelp,fpyzz97,t3_gew9gq,1589011114.0,"I've had a similar problem and the best advice I can give is just not do that. I know that's not really helpful in the moment but cut out that habit and it will fade. 99% of the time there's absolutely nothing we can do as an individual even if a conspiracy was true, so I find it easier to opt for voluntary ignorance. It seems like a cop out but it's important to remember mental health is extremely valuable especially in these strange days. I would suggest focusing on more uplifting media, if you can. Hope you feel better"
Anxietyhelp,fpyyu9r,t1_fpri5rs,1589010725.0,I agree with this philosophy.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fpuz6dh,t3_gff1e1,1588928991.0,"I feel like Japanese animals are just cuter. Like, the opposite of how everything in Australia wants to kill you. They just want to kidnap children to the spirit world is all. It's cute."
pics,fputwu7,t3_gfmaxh,1588923573.0,I say let the punishment fit the crime.

5htp,fputg2f,t3_gfecqa,1588923114.0,"I've taken 5htp for about 8 years or so, on and off. I find it best to only take it when needed now. And my definition of what is needed has changed, as well. I recommend taking frequent breaks if your mental health can afford it. I try to look at it like, ""how bad do I need this right now, or could I possibly need it more tomorrow and really NEED it to work."" I haven't seen much data on it, because 5htp seems to be under studied, but I have a theory it can slowly cause receptor sites to diminish because of how much free serotonin you are introducing into your brain/body. Also it has definitely been shown to diminish catecholamine levels (dopamine and friends) which can cause a similar mental state. L-Tyrosine can help with that. I recommend using 5htp as an aid to feel better while you search more deeply for the root cause of your imbalance."
Anxiety,fpr3n0w,t3_gelkhi,1588841197.0,"I've had similar symptoms, started really looking into the gut health/serotonin health field and got some relief. Probiotics and a healthy diet can really make a difference in my experience."
Anxiety,fpr3bna,t3_g8414i,1588840882.0,"I feel that, there's always something for it to latch onto. I was lucky enough to develop testicular microlithiasis, which I noticed as a painful lump. Straight week of hellish panic until I could get an ultrasound and a diagnosis telling me I don't have cancer and I'm not dying. But at random times I can fall back into that same fear and anxiety over something as trivial as a slight headache or chest pain. So much fun."
5htp,fpndf13,t3_ffd1ft,1588758984.0,Id recommend supplementing with L-Tyrosine if you aren't already. Sounds like you could be experiencing a catecholamine shift.
5htp,fpnda7n,t3_ffs47z,1588758845.0,"Ive used my brain like a toy since I was 15, now 24 and been dealing with a good deal of serious long-term mental side effects (severe anxiety, depression, extreme malaise) and I've been working very hard to try and repair as much of the damage I can with no other option. I'm here to tell you all of those psychedelics are beautiful and useful, but there's a price to pay if you are wreckless and pour cocktails of neurochemicals into yourself. The brain and gut are precision instruments and should be maintained. I know it can feel like it can't get any worse, but as a fellow psychonaut, take warning and be mindful. Things can ALWAYS be worse, just as they can be better. Stay safe!"
5htp,fpnbt4a,t1_fpmsdt9,1588757322.0,Which I think is important to point out balances out the main negative long term effect of catecholamine depletion. They seem to be synergistic.
todayilearned,fp92ian,t3_gbsl4m,1588411797.0,I've heard that the batches that workers are testing are large and flash frozen. So having a gold spoon lowers the cold transferrence to the tongue and lips which could stick to a lower quality metal at the same temperatures.
