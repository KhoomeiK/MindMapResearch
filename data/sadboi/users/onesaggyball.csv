I will go through my Facebook and see a thread and think of a really witty comment, but by the time I get to writing the end of my message, 100 different thoughts have attacked my mind and stops me from tapping send... I overthink everything in my life, big to small, and it affects literally everything I do, it‚Äôs a curse really... I wish I could just be laid back and not care, but I do and it‚Äôs the most debilitating feeling. All I can say is if you have been advised to take any medication, take it, and listen to what people, ie, your doctor, is saying to you, even if you talk yourself out of sense... they do, believe it or not, know what they are talking abou(most of the time)... keep your chin up and just know, better times are around the corner..."

I Truely believe that there was no one on the planes, they were already dead and military jets were flown into the Twin Towers carrying a payload capable of tearing through reinforced steel thus bringing the towers down.
Edit: I know about the thermite by the way, but you can clearly see an explosion at the belly of one of the planes exploding before the plane even hit, and somehow the wings cut through that steel like it was butter... I fucking hate what the human race is capable of. üòî"

No the camera was set up facing the only door to the room it was placed in and we had literally just moved in that day, we had hardly begun the process of actually filling the flat, it was practically empty. In regards to the history, the last tenant died in there, and old lady who passed away in her sleep she was well liked by the whole street, not only by the people but the countless cats that would frequent the property. God  I miss those cats."
