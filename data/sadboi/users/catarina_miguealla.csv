depressed,fqec9b7,t3_ghxvs8,1589305188.0,"Well that was me. That’s the only reason I’m still alive. And especially after a read “suicide doesn’t end the past, it pass over to someone else”. So I’m not rushing to die. I’ll die anyway, and I might as well try to do anything to make myself and ppl around me more happy. I don’t how you feel but this is how I feel.

selfharm,fpo8341,t3_gejcvi,1588780004.0,"That sounds horrible! I’d also hate it if someone did the same to me, but don’t let her take away your confidence and don’t give her more power and damage more than she already has. Please continue to wear shorts and know that some people are just shit, but there are many amazing people out there too. And tbh most people don’t care and won’t even notice. When I see someone who is brave enough to not care, it really encourages me and really makes me feel happy and inspired. So please continue to wear those clothes, because you’re the one in charge here. Not that lady. So do what you want, she’s just a stranger. You are strong and very brave!"

EDAnonymous,fpl9tkj,t1_fpl6i38,1588708894.0,"Well I somewhat agree with it being genetic. I think people are much more vulnerable to having a mental illness that’s in the family. There can be something in the gene that makes them for example notice others physical appearances more than normally. Idk, but I think there’s something there. And the voice telling us “thinner is better” etc. will ultimately consume us the more we give in to it. That’s the worst part of this. It’s just so hard to break free from it"

If I were you I would first seek help and tell him if he doesn't stop you would take the child and leave.

SuicideWatch,fm8d9uv,t1_fm841wd,1585847299.0,"There is a difference between watching porn at the same times as he takes care of his gf both emotionally and physically, and watching porn even when it is not alright for the gf. By choosing to have a partner, you take the responsibility to take care of and love the person. And if the person has been abused as a child and really doesn't feel alright with you watching porn, you really should do everything to stop. It has something to do with the respect. You don't watch ppl harm themselves for fun if you have a girlfriend who had suffered with self-harm before. There is just something you need to do to makes your partner feel respected and loved.
