I wasn’t allowed to develop my own ego or a healthy sense of self. If I tried, they would tear it down— also, the culture of enmeshment didn’t provide for it. So I had to wait until I moved away from home to start developing my own ego, creating boundaries between my self and the outside.

My thoughts: detecting narcissism here, and I don’t think being non-narcissistic is a flaw

“Depressed individuals conversely showed no bias when rating themselves but a positive bias when rating others.”

My thoughts: perhaps for the depressed folk who suffer from poor self-esteem or are depressed because they constantly compare themselves to others, but for depressed misanthropes like me, I really don’t think I have rosy glasses on when I look at other people

“When assessing participant thoughts in public versus private settings, the thoughts of non-depressed individuals were more optimistic in public than private, while depressed individuals were less optimistic in public.”

depression_help,fnxuz8z,t3_g43laj,1587346895.0,"This is called being “passively suicidal”. You’re clearly not experiencing a healthy survival instinct yet. Biologically speaking, we’re not supposed to feel apathetic about living or existing, our gut instinct is supposed to be fiercely defensive about continuing to live and eliminating threats to our survival in our surroundings. The fact that you aren’t experiencing that survival instinct yet seems to indicate lingering depression and that your body is still over-stressed. I think as you continue to work on and improve your depression this will eventually stop. I think doing exercises where you can enjoy your senses (somatic therapies) would be useful. 

Just be cautious that even though you’re not actively wanting to die right now, you probably have a pretty short trigger to get to that point, so you should take this seriously and make sure you don’t have any dangerous means to hurt yourself around.

antinatalism,fmz3mr2,t1_fmz2rob,1586505123.0,"You can make the point! I didn’t cover the essential tenet of antinatalism (I.e. that forcing sentient life to exist is just flatly unethical) because I would not be able to get people to even be receptive to thinking about the issue if I tried to get abstractly philosophical. It was a tiny first step to just make people question their dogged impulse to procreate. 

I think to change minds, people would first have to be accepting that not having children is completely legitimate (harder than you’d think, look at the super butthurt comments), then another step to make the leap that it would actually be PREFERABLE if people stopped procreating. 

Most people think humans are the most wonderful creatures to ever exist and we must make as many of them as possible. I would like to shatter that delusion. Adopting antinatalism as a philosophy is not possible when you’re still operating under that assumption."
Tinder,fmz30bg,t1_fmz2c2u,1586504451.0,"Oh that’s disgusting and they are not real feminists... Those are called fuck boys right? Or is there a more specialized term?

It is incredibly important for me that I date a feminist— someone who understands the historical and continued oppression of women, the stifling limitations of the patriarchy on all genders, and how toxic masculinity has stunted the emotional expression of men and made them isolated and unable to connect deeply. In my experience, men who have not fully discovered and embraced feminism have difficulty understanding me and the pressures I am under by society, and are also incapable of connecting to themselves and accessing their own emotions, because they’re still buying into the patriarchy’s message to “man up!” and “don’t show emotions because that makes you weak!” 

I really prefer dating men who are emotionally available, capable of accessing and identifying their own feelings, and compassionate and kind-hearted in their interactions with others. Identifying as a feminist doesn’t guarantee those qualities, but I don’t believe I’m likely to find them in someone who doesn’t."
