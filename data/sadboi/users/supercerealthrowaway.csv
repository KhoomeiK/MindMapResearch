So a typical day for me, if I'm on for a whole shift from open: 

Discharge the book drop. All of the books/DVD put in the drop after close get get scanned, magnetic security reactivated, and scanned again. Sorted onto one of our three carts to be taken to the stacks. Our carts are named Dolly Carton, Shelvis Presley, and Mario Kart. DVDs are put in those giant clear security cases as well. 

Then it's into the stacks to shelve the books. We also read shelves to look for misplaced books. 

We print off the holds and overdue lists and go look for the books. The holds are gathered, and overdues are checked off  (It's really bad if there's a book on the shelf that's been returned and not in the system). Then one of us calls the patrons to let them know we have their hold items or they have an overdue item. The most important part of that is making sure you' DON'T tell anyone besides the card holder what items they have on hold or are overdue. 

We have a board that tells us who is doing what where every day in two hour chunks. Desk, floor, float. Desk, you stay at the desk, checking books in and out, sending faxes, helping with the copier, checking computers in and out, etc. 

Floor, you're shelving books and reading shelves. Basically you're making sure all the books are in the right place and trying to keep the DVDs from getting too far away from their section. 

Floating, you stay in juvenile fiction, shelve the kids' books, and keep an eye on the computers. 

The worst part is not being able to help someone or having to kick someone out. Or if there's an inattentive parent and their child tries to dart into the parking lot."
