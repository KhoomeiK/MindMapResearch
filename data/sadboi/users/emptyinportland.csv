I simply needed to scroll. Didn't know that was all. I knew I had to be missing something otherwise obvious. Thanks so much for your help!"

depression_help,f3dq1kt,t3_dgmbrh,1570843760.0,"I think we all secretly wish that someone would intervene with us when we are feeling intense emotion, especially feeling depressed. Anger is more outloud and therefore brought into public discussion. 

I'm sorry to hear you cry in public sometimes, it happened to me once when I hated my job, and I almost took a really shitty job to get out, and my dad begged me not to do the stupid job on the phone while I was on a bus, packed with people. And I just broke down and balled. No one even tried to interact with me.

If you live in a populated city like I do, you should know people have a general understanding that you don't interact with people you don't know. Maybe a friendly ""hello"" or ""how's your day?"" But when some one is having a moment, most people assume you'd rather not be helped, or that someone else will help you. I even live in a place where people are nice and give a fuck.

It's nice that you have a good memory of a nice person taking the risk of interacting with you at a breaking point, and that the person was kind and made your week. Although it sounds like what you really seek is for someone to connect with you, on a level most people don't. 

Can I ask what the subject of the conversation was? 

Why were you crying that day? 

Do you have close friends that you can be deep with? 

How old are you?(you don't have to answer that question, but I think it's relevant)

Do you live in a populated city? 

And what's your favorite icecream?

If you want to answer but don't want to here, you don't have to. 

I hope you don't cry tonight, and that your having a good day today at least :)"
depression,ez7k51b,t3_d01jay,1567724746.0,"It is so important to open up to people about the things we feel. The reason isn't because the person your releasing to will know what to do or what answers to give. It's important because, just speaking out loud how we feel to another human being allows us to better reflect on what we are saying than it does to simply think it to yourself. It allows you to better construct how you feel and find where these feelings are derived from. In my opinion speaking outloud to another human how you feel, is more for you to help yourself than it is for them to help you. I feel this is true with all things in our heads; sad, bad and good emotions, new ideas, plans for the future, religious and political views. 

I am a very depressed individual, but I want all my friends and family to know they can tell me their problems, and allot of times I have no answers for them. I'll try to give advice, but I think if they can tell me how they feel, that's a big step in the right direction, which is to get out of their head and bring their emotions out into the real world.

I don't know how much help this post might be, and I don't know what issues lay with you. I hope you can find it in you to share yourself with those around you, and keep trying to find solutions."
depression,ey8rpau,t3_cvz4wk,1566926805.0,"Ive spent most of my life in some form a depression, and now I'm pushing 30, and I feel you. Some days it feels like I'm just counting down the clock till I die. I'm not suicidal, but the thought of living another 40+ sounds painful. 

I have a great life, I'm a white strait male in America, with a loving family, great place to live, awesome job, bills are paid, I have freedom. But somehow I feel empty, and worthless. 

I hang in there because I have hope that someday I'll find myself and what really makes me happy. Otherwise I just keep living because what else do you do?"
socialskills,eua8zys,t3_cdgdlg,1563606307.0,"I'm on the not listening end. I have a one tract mind, I'm proficient in life but it's hard for me to multitask. 

I find it very easy for, while I'm listening to someone to, go off on a series of what I call ""rabbit holes"". While I'm spacing out on these thoughts, whoever is still talking and I haven't heard a word since I fell into the first rabbit hole. While although I do feel bad and will openly explain myself, I'm labeled as someone who doesn't want to pay attention. That's not true, I want to, I'm just ditsy."
socialskills,eua8nu7,t3_c9em8u,1563605851.0,"I have 15 close friends, some I see every day, some rarely. I don't think I've ever had a real connection with anyone, not even my family. 

The person I hang out with the most is a chatterbox and could go on for days about anything with out you saying a word. I am glad he accepts me but I mostly keep him around so that I don't appear as boring. 

It's been hard to accept, but I'm pretty sure I'll never find anyone I can connect with on a level where I feel totally comfortable.

I was mostly relating, and if you (or anyone) read this. I don't specifically speak to people because I'm lonely but when I do I'm always uncomfortable, even when I'm having a good conversation with a random person, especially someone I find to be attractive. 

I find it very easy to shun the world, hide in my room and create my own reality. However I force myself almost daily to interact with someone anyone.

I think it's important (but not required) that we as humans in a successful society socialize, it's what builds and makes our success as a species."
