nursing,fqhc0re,t1_fqh3lwr,1589373647.0,"Hey no worries! It‚Äôs good to exchange experiences :)

Derm is currently my field, but my first job out of nursing school was nursing homes. After that it was home health, school nursing through a staffing agency, and dialysis. Because I started in a nursing home, I felt that I always got overlooked for inpatient floor nursing positions, even nonacute ones, so I just stuck with outpatient nursing. 

Getting my current position was somewhat of a fluke lol. 4 years ago I was friends with a nurse who was dating the son of a dermatologist. My friend posted that the dermatology office was hiring so I applied. At the time they were only looking to hire LPNs but I applied as a RN anyway. I interviewed really well and they liked me a lot, so they created a position for me! I‚Äôve been with them ever since. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out on much, IMO. Nursing home and dialysis were some of the most stressful jobs I‚Äôve had. I was the overnight shift and that alone was very tough on my body. The administration at the nursing home I worked at was also terrible, so I really disliked them. I can only imagine that ICU and ER would be even more stressful than that!

I love my current job and I‚Äôm pretty much going to stay in it unless they fire me for some reason lol. I have a great work-life balance and I feel especially lucky now, actually, because COVID shut down a lot of outpatient practices, but not dermatology because we started offering virtual visits, since dermatology is a very visual field to begin with. I also started working from home because of the pandemic, something that few other nursing fields would be able to do! 

I recommend that, if you want the floor experience, to start there first. Inpatient floor nursing can always transfer out to outpatient clinic nursing, but it‚Äôs harder to do it the other way around. Good luck!"

AmItheAsshole,fnvxnuy,t3_g3ufyl,1587307160.0,"Late to the party but wanted to add that OP is NTA. Let me explain before raining downvotes on me:

I have friends with chronic illnesses that makes attending social functions extremely draining and difficult. I love these friends and love seeing them, and some I would definitely call my best friends. However, if it was my wedding and I invited them and they said ‚Äúsorry, I can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just too much, but here‚Äôs $1000 and my well wishes‚Äù, I‚Äôd be damned if I tried to guilt them into coming to my wedding. 

OP doesn‚Äôt say *why* he doesn‚Äôt like to go to social functions, but he has demonstrated, over the period of his friendships with the engaged couple, that he *doesn‚Äôt do social functions* and that should be enough. The couple stayed friends with him despite knowing that OP doesn‚Äôt like social functions. It took them until their *own* special social function to realize ‚Äúoh shit, he won‚Äôt even come to *our wedding*?‚Äù To realize that that‚Äôs unacceptable?? And the friendship spanned several years? At this point it shouldn‚Äôt matter *why* OP doesn‚Äôt like to attend social functions. It‚Äôs part of who he is and it‚Äôs up to the engaged couple to decide whether or not they want to accept that about being friends with OP. 

Being friends means accepting people as they are. I think the couple are the assholes for 1) giving an ultimatum and 2) not accepting that this is part of who OP is until it actually impacts them. I don‚Äôt think the OP is the asshole because he has shown this couple who he is through the span of their friendships and hasn‚Äôt tried to hide it, and it sounds like he doesn‚Äôt like special functions regardless of whose it is. The fact that he gave them $1000 for the wedding also shows, imo, that he values their friendship. He just shows that differently than how the couple wanted it to be. All of you saying that people have different love languages? OP also has a different love language, but somehow he‚Äôs the only one being expected to change that about himself.

Honestly, I do think OP might not be neurotypical, and wanting him to change himself to please others is a very selfish and neurotypical thing to try to enforce on people who are not neurotypical."

2) I live alone and I‚Äôm relatively healthy. I got tested for COVID and was negative right before sheltering in place became a standing order in my city. As long as I keep up, I should be able to make it through the pandemic without contracting COVID. 

3) I‚Äôm using time working from home to catch up on tv shows. I‚Äôm also ordering delivery food more. I used to only order delivery 1-2 times a month because I‚Äôd meal prep weekly. Now I‚Äôm ordering delivery weekly to ‚Äúsupport local businesses‚Äù lol. It‚Äôs been a really nice treat. All of this feels like I‚Äôm on extended spring break or something. 

4) my friends regularly reach out to schedule games and virtual hang outs. They‚Äôre all relatively safe and in good health too. Same goes with my family. 

5) I‚Äôm single so I‚Äôm still dating and I‚Äôm finding virtual dates over Zoom to be more and more preferable. So many benefits to it that really offers a balance to irl dates.
