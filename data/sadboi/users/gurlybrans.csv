I didn’t do all these daily but I made them my simple goals. Eventually I got out of my deep depression. Also, I started Paxil, an antidepressant, and this helped a lot."

depression_help,f7er55m,t3_dvsgpl,1573663985.0,I went through a couple of months while trying different anti depressants and there were definitely times where I felt like I didn’t know what was real anymore. I had to repeat to myself “you are not your thoughts and feelings. They are happening to you and that is why you think they are real. Then I would watch the clock and count off the hours and tell myself things would get better in 48 hrs. Oftentimes things subsided for a few days and I would remind myself to love and accept myself exactly as I am

My chronic depression began in my teens. I didn’t get professional help until my 20’s and wish I could have gotten it sooner. Look at YouTube videos on self compassion
