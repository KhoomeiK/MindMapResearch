One minute I was walking down a hallway, next second I was walking down a city sidewalk, miles from where I was in the middle of the night.  Not even no idea how I got there but the disorientation was insane; my pace was different, the air, the temperature, my state of mood(?) - it wasnt at all waking up or coming to, it was like \*blink! and every single frame of reference had changed.  Jarring doesnt even describe it.  I wouldnt even believe it if it didnt happen to me.  5 hours lost."

canada,et0wq9x,t1_esyb8n9,1562388220.0,"Okay but i think at a certain point we have to acknowledge that some people dont like smells.  That is okay.  It can be as simple as averting your nose.  I don't think its okay to get frustrated at someone who has an odor I am not enjoying; I can be grossed out, I don't have to enjoy it but it seems absolutely rude for me make someone feel bad for because its my problem, not theirs.

&#x200B;

I don't know - there are hundreds of public smells I am not fond of.   Some are even offensive.   On Sunday nights my Sobeys has a vac truck out front and whatever it is they are pumping out fills the entire grocery store with the most god awful smell - not one person in the store is fond of it; I swear I can taste it but I sure don't just suffer my nose through that.  I'm not fond of other peoples farts either, but unless I know you like that, I sure am trying to make someone feel bad about it.

&#x200B;

I don't know.  I mean - I just feel like odor-shaming someone in public, even with a sneer and a hurumph, is not really okay.  What if someone is offended by the smell of barbeque? Should we start segregating public places because one group doesn't like how the other smells?  ""We are ok with them having rights but we just dont want smell them"".  

&#x200B;

Luckily, as it turns out, it's super easy not to endure an odor that you find offensive:

Step 1 - Encounter offensive smell

Step 2 - Avert your nose and stop smelling

&#x200B;

I'm totally fine with people farting, I don't really wanna smell them either.  I try not to but I also have kids and am certain that I will - every day."
BPD,et0fx38,t1_et01d95,1562378402.0,"Honestly!  I spend so much time as of late trying to piece together the last decade precisely in this way.  I cannot properly explain how difficult it is to do.  Like it started a couple of years ago dealing with a tax error from a couple years before and I had to sift through a mess of personal documents; it was heavy and I couldnt quite figure why.  Its an ongoing, massively daunting task because every single date confuses and surprises me.  Like ""wait what is this?  2014!? Wtf was 2014?!  Where the fuck was I?  That was two years before the thing!?  Wait... ok ok so like 6 months after that zone....was I alive??""  Then I spend so much time reconciling timelines and its actually drainingly hard - I can only commit to sorting out another pile every so often. 

&#x200B;

I remember entire chunks of my history like it was a show I watched a long time ago.  Stranger still is that the ability to recall or the clarity of recollection is independent of how long ago or in what order it was - like some episodes were in 4k and others are dim and fuzzy.

Its very odd and at times unsettling."

EDIT:  Ok I put together a bit of a list on [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca) \- i am surprised how much food you can buy online!  Not quite the outside aisles at the grocery store but holy moly.  Here is the list - I just added things that I would grab if i was shopping.   Walmart is trickier, as my car is currently GPS locked and there is no delivery as far as I could tell, but has everything that is needed (like dairy, produce, meats, breads etc).  Anyway, I appreciate even talking about things - like taking things out of my head.  I mean I feel ashamed almost to be putting together lists - feels so dicky....  like i know it shouldnt.  Its just - ugh - im used to noone helping.  Anyway here is the amazon [list](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/1M51OR7W91127?ref_=wl_share)  \- thank you so much for even considering to look at it.  (i dont know how not to feel ashamed and its legit hard to finish this edit....im sorry.  I love you all who even read this - literally.)"
Assistance,ert5ozd,t1_ersnyee,1561233142.0,"Oh shoot - my apologies; I wasnt certain what the protocol was and didnt want to come across presumptuous.  I dont know how it works or if anyone would even respond actually.  Food is the mission of the day today, as priority one.  I'm just relisting a bunch of ads that Ive got up selling things, as I try to grind out dollars where I can.  All less than 75$ items, which any one could sell at any time, which is the weekend grind.  It never ceases to amaze me what will sell and the manner in which they do - has saved the day many times.  

I mean, every day I'm out here trying to make it work - its not working haha, but I get up every day and try to look at it in a different way.  That's what brought me here this morning.  I am well used to figuring it out; its my life.  I am used to doing it alone.  Its a strange thing to turn to reddit and ask for help so long after I have accepted that - literally, well-wishes and a few of kind words has meant the world to me already.  

Long story long; good vibes, well wishes, love, respect - send them in haha.  Food is the priority of the day - absolutely yes.  From there I have to figure out my ability to get to interview monday, then rent, then.. well there are many miles in the road yet ahead - resurrection aint easy; but you cant very well crawl out of the grave without a couple of broken nails.  I am almost there - any and all assistance in any way is more than I thought I ever had."

That said, the scales have already begun to tip my way once more and your well wishes out there in the world weigh heavily.  Thank you."
