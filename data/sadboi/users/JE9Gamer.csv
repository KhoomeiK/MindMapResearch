YouShouldKnow,f0p1pqy,t3_d5qh3a,1568825223.0,"Best advice my adolescent self would of loved to of learned. Both my big toes got ingrown nails and both rather bad and infected. Went on for way too long. Unsure exactly when it started, but I would have to say maybe in the 6th grade? I was miserable and in pain. My dad finally takes the initiative to have me see a doctor since my mom pretty much made all the calls in the house and my dad just let things be for the most part. The doctor gets me a referral to see a podiatrist, and he removes my nails and says he has scared the sides of my toes so the scare tissue will keep the nails from ingrowing again. Some time's gone by and everything's healed up and growing but the nail color is nasty and flacky. See another doctor who gets me on medication to clear it up, but it doesn't, so we go back to the podiatrist and he removes my nails again. I've got to be in late high school by this point. Nails are growing back, but end up curving sideways by a lot, and are still infected with whatever made them discolored and flacky. These suckers hurt and I just tried to hide them. One summer I'm at the pool and playing around with my boyfriend at the time and I catch a nail on his swim trucks and it mostly rips the nail off. I get into the bathroom and have to rip the rest of it off. There's not much bleeding, just stings a lot. That nail still grew back in sideways. The way these nails were made it so I couldn't trim them. They grew quite a bit, but just stopped at some point.

As an adult at 26 I start to take my health seriously. I got out of a very long and horrible relationship. I was on my way to do better. My sister is an RN and she helps me establish my care at her clinic. She tells me she's not going to be my primary care, but will help me out first. We get me some depression meds prescribed and blood work done, she insists on a pap smear, and we have a look at my feet. She visibly feels bad for me. Tells me that must hurt, and I tell her she has no idea. I've been walking around with my big toes up for years because it hurts to walk with a flat foot. She gets me another doctor who takes off my nails again but says he's scared the root of the nail so it wouldn't be growing back. I can walk normal now and am almost not so embarrassed to have my socks off. I even paint my toe nails now, something I couldn't do since I was a kid. Nails did in fact grow back, but stop after growning just short enough. The nails are all ruff and really odd looking, but I tell people now that I'll take this over the horrible, borderline gangrene infection I had through my teens."
AskReddit,f0ounvb,t3_d5p9fk,1568820648.0,"r/DeadBedrooms is full of sexually frustrated and just soulless people. I subscribed to see if I could get any words of advice after having a talk with my boyfriend about some things in our relationship, and given, our relationship was still fresh enough. Everyone told me to jump ship and that I'll be miserable, he'll never change, and a whole bunch of unlining issues ahead for me. I recently saw a women post that she gave her husband an ultimatum to get more involved, or let them have an open relationship or else she's ready for a divorce. Very hateful and intitled post. I felt for a the man. Sometimes you can just see the issue.

I also asked for some help from r/PitBulls when my dog was losing her shit and bitting people and most everyone called me a horrible dog owner and that I needed to get her to a better home. One guy ranted so long, then tells me that if I'm close enough he'd help me, but I'm not about to meet anybody that comes out of a hate mob off of the internet.

My relationship is fantastic and fulfilling, and my nugget is doing loads better. We're all wholesome over here, so internet jerks can suck it!
