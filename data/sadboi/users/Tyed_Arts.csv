NarcissisticAbuse,facto8n,t1_facr424,1575946780.0,The same thing happened to me! Opposite roles here. I’m a guy who dated a cover female narcissist. But narcissistic abuse is narcissistic abuse!
swordartonline,f9wugxr,t3_e71glm,1575699087.0,Beautiful!! Is there a link so I can see the entire thing in detail?
BreakUps,f7d3vct,t3_dvedtd,1573606925.0,And this has made my day! Thank you for the post!!
ADHD,f6qej83,t3_dsj1lx,1573075825.0,I must have reverse adhd my paranoia makes me show up 40 mins early to like every appointment.
depression,f6e5sbv,t3_dqyqmi,1572800535.0,Same here! What kind of music do you listen to to put you into your safe place of comfort?
depression,f6dhi4c,t3_dqzb2r,1572794287.0,"Lmao I can relate! I should be working on art and doing other passionate activities. Thank god i still manage to workout 😐

But totally normal as long as all the bills are paid. Don’t kick yourself my man. We all have a process that helps us get through it.

But what helps me is letting myself go for the first day of 2..then I begin to remember myself at my highest point..I get mad and tell myself this “since when have you forgotten your a beast, since when have I stopped being a monster that kicks ass at life”. Then you take that anger and you clean tf out that house, you tackle tf out them chores, you socialize tf out them people!! Hope this helps"

depression,f6d7evx,t1_f627hcl,1572791990.0,"Yes I absolutely agree with you!! For me it would definitely be art, martial arts, and fitness. I feel as though I still have a long way to go because random occurring depressions don’t make my journey to self recovery any faster. And I am a bit behind for the age of 30 but both a good friend and my therapist have been kind enough to leave me with some wisdom as a functioning adhd/depressed man:

“Who cares about how long your journey takes, because those people won’t be there to end it with you”. 

Hope this quote inspires anyone who is reading this as a depressed person on the road to self discovery."
depression,f6d4etw,t1_f5xut4o,1572791254.0,That’s exactly what it is. I go through the same thing so I can confirm this.
depression,f6d441y,t1_f5znrm4,1572791190.0,"Lmao..sorry it’s just that I deal with the same issue! 😂😂😂 

Most people won’t understand because they confuse normal depression or sadness with actual real physical depression that in addition affects you mentally and emotionally."
depression,f6d3jyg,t3_dpl4bu,1572791028.0,"I understand exactly what you mean!! Reading this is like looking at a reflection in the mirror. It is like living a double life and somehow for me it’s that I’m not aware that I appear like there’s nothing wrong with me to most people (because I sometimes apologize about things I think I’ve done that they didn’t notice at all). But same here. I get people to laugh, I’m in great shape, handsome guy, and I have a secure job that pays the bills. Even on my worst days the depression really affects me I can still function..though sometimes people can read it on my face and ask me, but I just tell them I’m dealing with some issues back at home just so I don’t have to explain to them my adhd causes me to have sudden depression episodes. 
It sucks because it’s hard to maintain relationships with any girl because it generally ends up affecting them and they expect you to be this macho man who handles everything. Lol sorry not going to go there but thank you for the post because it really is nice to know I’m not the only person going through this."
BreakUps,f6afiwt,t1_f69sy83,1572756146.0,Truth is if they actually did care about you they have thought about you from time to time..but they have to fight not seeing you just like you do too.
BreakUps,f69zb50,t1_f6988u7,1572749889.0,Welp me knowing she had to crawl under someone else right after the break up while I face this all own my own gives me strength. Though seeing her in person during my healing process can be triggering 😑
BreakUps,f6980a2,t3_dqmssa,1572737705.0,Omg I’m going through the same exact thing and it sucks. Worse part is I live with her friend as my roommate and I have to periodically see her 😑
ADHD,f66wwul,t3_dqisjd,1572714599.0,I find it hilarious how people who don’t have it spend so many hours trying to do research only to tell you what they think the solution to the problem is from generic information they got from the web...😑😑😑
