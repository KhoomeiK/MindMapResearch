relationship_advice,fqa1sbf,t3_ghn2yd,1589211268.0,Idc how mad I am at my partner.. I would never refuse to speak to them or miss out on congratulating them for an important moment. I think this is a sign that you need to end the relationship. You know what you deserve or you wouldn‚Äôt have posted this!!
relationship_advice,fpokpdh,t1_fpoceo1,1588786123.0,Hahahah yes
relationship_advice,fpoknlv,t3_gelsxm,1588786099.0,Yeah he has a porn problem. tell him to try to fix the issues (and make sure he knows HE is the issue not you) or tell him to fuck off lol. Honestly he sounds like a jackass and you deserve better.
relationship_advice,fpdhdlr,t3_gcslky,1588527020.0,"This is not okay. You are not overreacting... but you are in a relationship with someone that does not respect you enough to stop when you are in pain. 
You withdrew your consent when you asked him to stop. For him to keep going is not only rape, but a violation of your trust and worth as a person. 
Please, think long and hard about continuing a relationship with this man.
I am so sorry this happened to you."
weddingplanning,fpcrcr6,t1_fpbi068,1588510517.0,"I was in your shoes two weeks ago.... and I am so sorry for everything you‚Äôre going through. 

For me, having a solid plan/something to look forward to helped a lot. Once we had our postponement figured out and a new date I was so relieved!

I‚Äôm still having major jolts of grief... and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to go away. You‚Äôre allowed to grieve over an event that you worked so hard to plan.. and not to mention one of the biggest and most important days of your life.
I‚Äôm less than two weeks out from what was supposed to be my wedding and every day that gets closer to 5/16 gets even harder. I‚Äôm having bizarre and emotional dreams.. waking up feeling extremely sad... episodes of crying... etc. 

I just want you to know that you aren‚Äôt alone. It‚Äôs okay to feel this way...but keep in mind that none of this will matter when you marry your person. It will all work out in the end. 

Also, the future mental health professional in me has to mention that talking to somebody could be very helpful as well.

Take care of yourself!"
relationship_advice,fobd6ar,t3_g6f3bl,1587658608.0,"Please connect him with a therapist. I can‚Äôt imagine the pain he is feeling... he needs to talk to someone to find coping methods. Hopefully he will willingly do it. 

I am so sorry you both are going through this. He is truly a hero to us all during this pandemic."
relationship_advice,fna62hv,t3_g0h0pp,1586791717.0,She‚Äôs still adjusting. It will take time. I imagine that being a pre teen and going through those life changes are extremely difficult. Show her love and patience and eventually you will get it back in return.
relationship_advice,fmltjsv,t1_fml40i1,1586192964.0,That‚Äôs a good sign! I hope for your sake things do work out. ‚ù§Ô∏è
relationship_advice,fml3fsr,t3_fv9pb1,1586177592.0,"I recommend that you either go into counseling or end the relationship. It sounds like she is struggling and doesn‚Äôt know what she wants. She shouldn‚Äôt have gotten married in the first place, but obviously that can‚Äôt be changed. Her feelings aren‚Äôt going to just go away, so In my opinion you either need to commit with each other to work on the relationship or go your separate ways."
relationship_advice,fmc1e1w,t3_fubn0u,1585937084.0,DUMP HIM. You are perfect and beautiful the way you are. He is trash.
relationship_advice,fhl82ek,t3_f3rr69,1581696773.0,"That‚Äôs awful. Confront them about it and see if you guys can resolve things. If not, walk away. You don‚Äôt need those people in your life!"
relationship_advice,fhbch14,t3_f29606,1581439432.0,It‚Äôs your body and she‚Äôs manipulating you. This is a huge red flag.
relationship_advice,fhbccoj,t3_f21zyz,1581439360.0,He will do this to other women. It will not stop with you. Check your laws and press charges if you can. This is absolutely horrifying. It may seem drastic to press charges but he will continue to victimize women like this.
relationship_advice,ff4ex3s,t3_erdulm,1579561977.0,You should talk to someone. Therapy is such a great resource.
relationship_advice,fer7af9,t1_fer4xfj,1579350687.0,Yep that‚Äôs what I meant
relationship_advice,feo7122,t3_eq6har,1579295934.0,"Yeah that changes my thought on it, but you leaving was good. She needs to apologize to you and you should let her know that you‚Äôre having some insecurities. She should support you and understand if she loves you. Trust is a big thing, so I can see how she may be upset that you aren‚Äôt trusting her but that‚Äôs no reason to completely blow up and say mean things."
relationship_advice,feo65xt,t3_eq6har,1579295642.0,Her freak out was out of guilt. She‚Äôs hiding something! If she wasn‚Äôt she would have calmly reassured you.
relationship_advice,feo5vh7,t3_eq60yr,1579295471.0,He needs to confront her.... not you.
relationship_advice,fek4b09,t3_epfbkr,1579192311.0,Did you cheat on her? Did she cheat on you? Are you still together? Have you talked to her about it? I feel like there‚Äôs some info lacking in this... but I guess you need to tell her how you feel and if you‚Äôve talked it out and still feel like your relationship isn‚Äôt the same then go with your gut.
dui,feheyt9,t1_feh9b80,1579115158.0,"Thanks so much, this really helps settle our nerves about it. üòä"

dui,feh5mup,t1_feh57t7,1579109641.0,"Awesome, thank you. I‚Äôve been reading stuff online and a lot of people say they can technically deny you but most likely won‚Äôt since it‚Äôs a misdemeanor. But still wanted to double check so we don‚Äôt have any hiccups"
dui,feh5jws,t1_feh53wv,1579109591.0,"That‚Äôs what I have heard, thanks!"
relationship_advice,fdxvcju,t3_en8a8m,1578773308.0,This isn‚Äôt love. Get rid of him!
relationship_advice,fdcnrgx,t3_ekkha4,1578279494.0,That‚Äôs a hard one. She could have some underlying issues such as depression that‚Äôs making it hard for her to take care of herself. I think you should let her know that her health is important to you and it‚Äôs hard for you to see her neglecting herself.
relationship_advice,fdcnhsu,t3_ekm65y,1578279299.0,"Pressuring you into sex is sexual assault. I understand not a lot of people agree, but no means no and he obviously didn‚Äôt respect your wish to leave."
relationship_advice,fdcmjwx,t3_ekk52x,1578278627.0,"Look into free resources. Often they are there, just not super visible! Also employee assistance programs can offer counseling. I did it through my mom‚Äôs employer."
relationship_advice,fdclsfk,t3_ekeb9n,1578278079.0,"This is funny to me, but since its something that bothers you let her know. She will either respect it and not do something similar again or she‚Äôs probably just not the one for you ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
relationship_advice,fcvwe5b,t3_ej3aq7,1578011611.0,Nooooot normal

socialwork,f1mqq3w,t3_d9uy84,1569600036.0,"Follow your heart. But if you decide to stay, really focus on self care. Try some rituals, such as showering/changing clothes right when you get home. Or sitting in your car and practicing mindfulness before you enter your house. Those things can sometimes help shift your work identity to your personal life identity. I also think that your compassion fatigue is going to lessen once you have more experience. Since it‚Äôs new and a change, you‚Äôre going to have a lot of emotions and new feelings. I think with time you will  begin to be a little less empathetic (that sounds terrible lol but it‚Äôs actually helpful). Overall, do what is best for YOU!"
depression,f0qqu5b,t3_cvmbzg,1568864587.0,I wish I could sleep.
relationship_advice,eyzvidz,t3_czhvrp,1567625518.0,It is not your fault. I am so sorry that you‚Äôre going through this. Hang in there.
