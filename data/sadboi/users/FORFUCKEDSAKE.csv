People have crazy trust issues there days and since social media is just such a norm it's more weird that you don't have it than someone that has 5 accounts on one platform. 

But from my point of view, I wouldn't care if someone I dated doesn't have social media. I want to lessen my use of social media as well so I compleetly get it.
