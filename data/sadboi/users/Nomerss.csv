Anxiety,fforal3,t3_eubcjg,1580080782.0,"As we all continue to fight our battles against the war of anxiety we should feel the comfort of not being alone. Although the light looks bleak at points remember help is right around the corner. Reach out to a family member, friend, neighbor, Reddit, anyone. Do not fight your battle alone strength comes with numbers and I believe we can all win our battles."

Showerthoughts,fdyw1xd,t3_en7gsm,1578784157.0,"It is not my field of study, but primates require a certain amount of time to eat and gain energy. For example, monkeys and gorillas spend 9 hours a day eating to maintain proper health. Humans are advanced, we utilize advanced technology, and have a more protein based diet so we do not need eat as often, but because we cook our food and we focus on meals (dividing evenly throughout the day I.e. 3 meals), that is another reason we eat the way that we do."
Anxiety,fdyuq83,t3_en7g7v,1578783790.0,"I understand where you are coming from. A lot of times I lay bed and want to do nothing, talk to no one, and just sleep. A few ways I combat this, and this is easier said then done, is get up. When I realize I am having those feelings I give my self 6 seconds to get out of bed. Eating some healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, drinking a lot of water, and practicing some mindfulness helps a ton. Lastly, even though you feel you do not have the energy to talk to anyone, combat it directly, reach out to someone: get food, coffee, have a meaningful conversation, something productive. This will help reenforce positive connections to these feelings. 

Grant it, this a personal prescription, it may not work for you, it is what I found works best for me. Now, sometimes those days come where you don't want to deal with anything and that's find too, just don't let it control you.

You got this!"

When I was on vacation in Santa Monica I was doing my morning routine of running every morning. I had these (at the time) special running headphones that sealed the ear perfectly  when you ran so they didn’t fall out and didn’t throw off your equilibrium. Well, the physical headphone part came disconnected from the ear tip. It was far enough in to the point where you could not scoop it with the fingers. So me-being-me tried to use a small stick to drag it out of my ear. That did nothing but make it worse. It was pushed all the way back to my ear drum where it was stuck to it with wax and temporarily immovable. So I went to immediate care and explained the situation, got some weird looks, and eventually a smart ass doctor who yanked the ear tip out. When he pulled out the ear tip the waxed came with it but it kind of snapped my ear drum (almost like snapping a rubber band or balloon). It was the strangest sensation, like relief, but I got light headed and tunnel vision. Nonetheless, don’t put foreign objects in your ears kids."
