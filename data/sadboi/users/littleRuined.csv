StopSelfHarm,flgewf1,t3_fofduh,1585140808.0,"Yeah, anything that involves you getting hurt by yourself is considered self harm whether it's physical or emotional.

Before I go, I recommend you stop punching your head before you cause yourself any irreversible damage."
selfharm,flekrm9,t3_fnzjjm,1585086276.0,This thing developed into a habit you're addicted to. You need to get sober before you do something serious and maybe irreversible because the more you delve in your addictions the more intense the habit becomes.

toxicparents,fg6huta,t3_ewm5we,1580568391.0,"It's OK that you failed college, but keep in mind that you should do something about it, right? What I recommend you to do is start your own small business so you could earn some money while also working part-time. It won't be a fast process and it might take a few years till you're able to quit your part-time job and rely only on your own business.

What's great is that you could start yours for free, but make sure you have a good idea in mind. PM me if you'd like to get some help.

As for friends, don't worry, you can get friends when you move out away from your parents, and you're able to live on your own.

Good luck ;)"

toxicparents,fexn4dz,t3_eql7l2,1579433540.0,"Make sure you have enough money and that you could also earn money after leaving. Also don't forget your legal documents (birth certificate, passport, etc...).

And by the way, did you know that you could sue them for abusing you?

Anyway, I don't recommend you leave unless you're 18+ and you're 100% sure you could handle your life on your own (finance, physical and mental health, your career, etc). Think for a moment (without any negative feelings) ""Am I gonna be able to live the life I want if I leave right now?"".

Good luck"
