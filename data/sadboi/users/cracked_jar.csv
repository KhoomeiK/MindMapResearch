 I had my pocket full of mints and ate one.
Couple of bullies who were sitting nearby saw this ... So they asked for some. I gave them... But then they felt my pocket and realized I had lot more in there..

Then a struggle ensued while they tried to take all my mints and I was trying to hold them back..

Between all of this ruckus I saw the teacher walking down the aisle staring right at me. Those kids they didn't see him coming. When he finally come up to us .. they quickly rushed back to their seats and sat.. while stood there standing... With the art teacher standing right in front of me.. staring me down.

After which he said something along the lines of being a naughty kid and then made me hold my ears as well.
