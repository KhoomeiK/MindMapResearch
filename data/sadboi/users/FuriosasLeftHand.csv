This just shows how little you understand the marginalization that the LGBTQ community faces.

First, you belittle our discrimination by posting this trash-and then you go a step further with that discrimination by saying, ‘who knows?’.

Then you decide that people are absurd when they believe in the possibility of gender fluidity and feminine equality.

You can’t objectively decide on what is ‘true’ and what is ‘false’ when the possibility that everyone who reasons is inherently as ‘wrong’ as they are ‘right ‘.

While someone may be gender fluid, they can believe in the cis-ness of women-or men. Just as they can believe in the people being bi or straight or gay.

Life is more than two directions.

And the final jab about ‘men taking some hormones’ is just silly. That’d be like referring to someone without basic empathy as a virus wearing a skin suit.
