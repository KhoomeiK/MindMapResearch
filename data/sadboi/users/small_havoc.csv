Rule of thumb is if you can't hear people speaking while you're listening to music, it's already too loud and will damage your hearing. So these are great for preventing needless volume jacking.

This is where it gets sticky for me. I'm not a TERF, spent a lot of time advocating for Trans rights, defended trans girls in public when they were getting legit transphobic abuse from assholes, and changed a lot of minds and views over the years. Do I get my ally cookie? Basically, I'm trying to point out I'm not filled with trans hate, or any trans negativity. But there are small things I disagree with on a personal level that I would be called a TERF for thinking. E.g. no, discussions about periods cannot be demonised as ""exclusionary"" - that is dangerous, we just got out of being completely silent; cis lesbians are not transphobic to not want a penis - they just don't want a penis; no, it's not fair to say you're jealous that I got to have an illegal abortion - I should not have to defend why I think that comment is selfish and fucked up. Like. These are things I cannot budge on, but they do not mean I am transphobic. I can believe all those things and still being trans women are women. I see some of these views being lumped in with TERFism. 5 years ago TERFs were actual bigots, but now the bar for ""bigot"" is so low that someone like me who even thought they might be trans for a while* is a TERF for having different points of view largely revolving around my own fucking trauma of being a woman.

From a different POV (not devil's advocate), I am someone who has been in that grey area (not the prostitution part, although I'm not sure the main character was even fully aware she was a prostitute? *iirc they weren't meant to be doing sex at all, the ending was ambiguous) a few times and watching it was painful but cathartic. Had my experiences been more definitive it probably would have been highly triggering. There were things that were against my will but I didn't say no so I just harboured all the conflicting disappointment/sadness/disgust but had no name for it. I dunno, it resonated with me like that."

Not necessary, but I mean, if you're making music people don't absolutely hate then already using music theory in practice, just not deliberately. Theory ""rules"" don't have to be followed, but they're usually what sounds good to a western audience."

Exactly, I absolutely hate aestheticism. Also it's ironically reinforcing gender stereotypes, because obviously you can't be a girl and have short hair and wear non-girly clothes. 🙄"

gaming,f8w9f25,t1_f8w7dcm,1574885951.0,"""I felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are cool, detached, and unreliable. I felt much warmer with dogs around me—cats are as hard to understand as women are. Men feel more sure of themselves with a male friend than a woman. You always need to keep women at arm's length. We don't want anyone taking over our souls, and women have a habit of doing that. So there's a love-resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I'm being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel that I've had better relationships with male friends than women. With women, once the romance is over, somehow they never remain my friends.” - Bob Kane


Food for thought maybe. Also it's worth considering the gaze of the creator, and the gaze of the audience. It's unfair to dump the burden of misogyny back onto people who are pointing it out by co-opting language used to describe it in the first place. A character can be super sexy, but you don't need to pretend that's not the entire point. She was a saucy plot device to give teenagers something to blush about. You don't need to fabricate an argument around it. You can just like the vapid sexy character while realising it's good that we now think ""hey a female character can be more substantial than that."" I think she's cool af, the hyper sexuality thing just seems so dated to me but it makes sense for her. Cats are more fuckable than dogs I guess."

facepalm,f8dsf4k,t1_f8drevm,1574507789.0,"Yes all marginalised people face this, it is not a uniquely trans experience. You don't owe anyone an explanation, but the flip side is punishing ignorance by being nasty, instead of giving the benefit of the doubt and explaining (if you're up for the emotional labour), just ruins some people's first impression of trans or any marginalised people. So I suppose declining to explain is understandable but blatantly making someone feel like an ignorant idiot who is doing something wrong by asking a genuine question (and yeah there are still people for whom that would be a genuine question) isn't the best way to go."

I have carried my cotton tote (yes yes, they're worse in terms of manufacturing) rolled up in my handbag for maybe 7 years now. I had to treat it like an essential - phone, keys, purse, tote. Have bought the odd bag for life in that time, but probably just one a year. Getting a cotton tote that I actually like has helped too. It's just from a small bookshop, but I like to be seen carrying it, so it's an incentive to remember. Half suggestions. I love your awards points idea though, that could be seriously effective."

How dare they point out the gaps in your understanding!! HOW DARE THEY? There's actually no excuse for your understanding being so myopic on this, try googling ... anything. 

There can be people who are drug addicts, and there can be people who are systemically disregarded for legitimate pain en masse. Both sets of people need help, but one set is used as a brush with which to tar the other. Hurrdurr."
