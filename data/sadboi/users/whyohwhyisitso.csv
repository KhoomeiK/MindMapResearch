first showed symptoms in 1995 as a kid. Was not diagnosed until my 30s but I know I had it back then. 

If anything, the internet has made being a mentally ill person MUCH better due to the availability of resources and access to other people. internet culture has helped to both destigmatize mental illness, while also stigmatizing BPD in some niche parts of the internet. I still think the internet is a good thing for depressed people.

I remember trying to find local organizations and education awareness about mental health back in high school (2002) and finding very little. Now, there are resources left right up and down, everywhere! Younger millennials and gen z have no idea how easy it is now to find help and get diagnosed compared to the 90s and y2k/pre-2010. 

When I was a preteen in the 90s there was NO education about mental health. In the 90s if you made a joke about being depressed it was dangerous. No one made jokes like that the way gen z makes memes and jokes about it now. Back then, People would get attacked, harassed or stabbed for admitting any kind of vulnerability like that — even in ‘privileged’ communities. People back then had horrible stereotypes about “crazy” people, as well as LGBTQ and racism."

PCOS,fojvfl9,t3_g7qi0z,1587830203.0,"Yes. I am lean PCOS. I don’t have weight gain by much at all, but when I do gain some weight it’s in my midsection only. I have cystic acne in the classic pcos formation, along with thick course chin hair and irregular periods, and obvious cysts on my ovaries in ultrasound along with pain in my ovaries when the cysts show up.

Only in the past two years have I been able to regulate my periods. 

What works is a routine regimen of exercise, diet, and supplements, or if you choose, hormonal birth control. 

I can’t take any hormonal birth control. I’ve attempted several kinds of BC but they’ve all affected my mental health too adversely for me to justify it. 

So I had to choose the alternatives, which aren’t as easy. 

The main objective when figuring out how to control PCOS is doing the things that reduce testosterone and cortisol. Cortisol is the hormone that is released when we are stressed, and it can affect the production of testosterone which will mess up your period. 

1) exercise that focuses on cardio without stressing the body out too much. Do not overwork to put yourself in a state of stress. Too much weight focused training will raise your testosterone and mess up your period.

2) diet. Cut out sugar and caffeine. Do your research on the importance of adhering to a low glycemic diet, which can include keto. Low glycemic foods and high protein and a lot of whole fibre from raw veg. 

3) supplements. I went to a naturopath who gave me the recommendation for Inositol and Vitex supplements. As it turns out there some small studies on the effectiveness of both. I did find a difference but you need to take these everyday at the same time, etc. I stopped because my lifestyle and job were so demanding and unscheduled that it was too difficult for me. That said, if you dig around reddit and elsewhere there are folks who share their stack dosages for their supplements. 

4) spironolactone for acne ended up helping my periods as a result of taking it."

In general, since 9/11 and with the dawn of cell phones + surveillence, all cities worldwide have changed drastically since the 90s.

Gen Xers and older Millennials who grew up in Toronto, imho, have a bigger grasp on music than the average person in most other cities, music was a bigger part of our youth and identity than it is for kids who are in their early twenties now.

The city overall was a little less concerned with money. The world in general was a very different place. Being queer was much more stigmatized. My lesbian friend who is older than me was followed, harrassed, and attacked by men several times throughout her twenties in the 90s because she had a girlfriend and was open about her queerness in her apartment building.

Taking selfies back then meant you were mentally ill. I remember being scolded by multiple people for pointing a polaroid camera at myself.  Plastic surgery was taboo, as was appearing too feminine/sexy if you were a woman. As a woman, you couldn't be as openly confident as you can now."

popping,fj9pktt,t1_fj9cijt,1583156267.0,It sometimes can hurt depending on where on the body it is. In my experience being sunburned (I can't tan unless it's a spray tan) generally hurts before the peeling stage. I find I can peel after my skin has stopped hurting and is regrowing itself.
