ask,f08gz9a,t3_d3upkp,1568481466.0,"I live in tornado alley and when the spring comes around we don't call it spring, we call it tornado season. Now depending on how humid it is during the spring we can just a few tornados or just a butt load of them. 
I think the worst one I ever experienced was one that happened in 2014. My brothers and I had just got back from school and weren't home for maybe an hour when we had to head over to my Papas house.( We don't have a shelter but my Papas house is a concrete done house so it's the safest bet.) We live in an area where we don't have sirens but if listen close enough you can hear sirens go off in the town not too far from my house. When there is a tornado we get rain but it's just pouring. It almost looks like a giant wall of rain, which leads to flooding. One of the scared parts of tornados is the sound they make. When the tornado was about to hit everything was so quiet, it was almost deafening. Then there was a giant gust of wind and a sound that could be described as a roar. Then the hail started to hit the roof of my Papas house, it sounded like cartoon bullet sound effects. The tornado tour right through my community and it was a big one. (An ef4, which is the second largest size a tornado can get.) 
 My family and I were EXTREMELY lucky, but my neighbors were not. One house had been flipped over and rammed into trees. There was roofs ripped off, one of my friends had lost the roof to his room. Of course everyone had no power for a good few days. And my school turned into a make shift dontaion center. My sister and I went to go get water and food, there were so many piles of once people's homes. We can't just leave it so we had to clean up our community. (I was disappointed in the lack of help from my state government because it really was devastateing.) Rest assure we didn't have school for a good week. It's very very scary, and that kind of stuff happens every year. Just this past spring we had I think almost a sixty tornados. Be happy you don't live somewhere like I do dude. It's nuts man."
