My awkward story : I had a vaginal prolapse. I had to have surgery to remove my cervix and uterus. They had to tack my bladder back into place.

 The full prolapse happened at work. (Don't hold your nose and sneeze)I had to tell my boss I needed to leave early. I was asked why. I calmly explained ""You don't want to know."" Before I had the surgery, I needed the bathroom a lot. I was terrified of coughing or sneezing in fear of peeing my pants. I got written up for it. I had to get a note from my doctor to explain my need for the extra bathroom time. Then, explain to HR why. (Fuck you, that's why!)


Now because of age, weight, having kids and the removal of said parts, I need to have a repair of a rectocele. It's all fun and games until you break your asshole and your vagina falls out!
