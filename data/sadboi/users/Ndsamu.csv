It’s very rare to find someone who is genuinely interested in the well being of others. Self-preservation reigns supreme in human nature. As such, depression via isolation leads to further isolation. Nobody wants to be around a downer. Not that I blame them. But it’s one evil mf cycle. I have a feeling my old friend is offering to visit Alaska with me for the ride. Could be my horrible trust issues. Or could be learned behavior and I’m just protecting myself. But I try my best to help others. At least when I am able. I ponder whether pure altruism even exists.

AlanWatts,fingcqm,t3_ew7k8h,1582562875.0,"This has become painfully evident to me. I was watching a boxing fight the other day and I became convinced the whole show was a sham. It started as a thought experiment but it became so blatantly evident to me. I thought to myself, “just consider that it’s possible all of this is a performance, nothing more.” I began to see it. The walkout was so extravagant that it could only have been paid for with the help of some boxing commission. The commentators were only discussing one fighter. The fighter that was to go on and win. It felt surreal. And depressing. It felt programmed and hopeless. In that moment I was just as sure of that fight being rigged as I was that the sun would rise. A thought experiment had become my perceived reality.

Yet I posted a comment on the subreddit about this and I was immediately downvoted to hell and berated. So in that moment it occurred to me that whether I was right or they were right, we were both supremely convinced of our position. No matter how wrong I was. Or how wrong they were. We both saw what we wanted to see.

It’s a silly example but it became so clear in that moment. We see what we want of the world. We are so much simpler than we credit ourselves."

At this point it’s like either I find a hobby that’s distracting enough or I end it. But I can’t end it because I was raised by a mother who’s brother took his own life around my age.
