remember thought humans are intrinsically biased and really arent perfect creatures. so dont put a lot of faith in yourself/humanity. questioning ourselves and our core beliefs is actually the best we can do to stay closer to truth.
eventually you will find something that ""clicks"" and will build up your worldview from there adding new facts and changing this system in your head according to the new information acquired. this is the way intps function so you re good.
