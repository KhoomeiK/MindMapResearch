Growing up, we never owned the houses we lived in. We rented and as prices became too high to live in the city (Anaheim, CA), we and many other people took to the suburbs where prices were much more affordable.  Those suburbs (Chino, CA), are now spendy and people have moved out even further.
Do I expect to be able to live in whatever city I want? Of course not! We didn't live in Beverly Hills or Malibu because it was not in our price range. 
Is there something I'm missing? Do people really think that it's not fair that they can't live in whatever city they choose?
Be kind, I'm really looking for an honest discussion about this."
