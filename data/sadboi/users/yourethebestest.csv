depression,fpn3vn2,t3_gea6mo,1588749367.0,"I used to feel like this until i actually found one and then realized I wasn’t a very good best friend. The friendship didn’t last but it taught me a lot. I couldn’t be a good friend because i sought out all my value from being liked by her and being there for her before myself. I had very little self worth and didn’t care about my life so i just attached myself onto hers. I was so worried 24/7 that she would find other friends to spend her time with and would leave me behind. I internalized all of it and spent all of my time waiting for her to text me, thinking about what she was doing, who she was with, checking to see if she was online (we were online friends), it completely consumed me. I was aware my behavior wasn’t normal and hated myself for being so obsessive. I tried to distance myself from her a few times to make it stop and i was horrible at communication so she would be worried about me because I would basically just disappear for hours. She wasn’t a perfect friend either but i definitely don’t blame her for how things went between us. When we first started getting closer she wanted to spend *so* much time together which i was not used to at all (I hadn’t had any friends for about a year and half before i met her) but almost never said no because like I said I hated my life and would look for anything to distract me at the time. So i grew to expect us to spend basically every waking moment together and when she actually started setting boundaries and living her own separate life, it put me in a pit of anxiety. No matter how many times she told me; I’m her best friend, her favorite person, that she loves and cares for me and would forever, it was never enough. My anxiety and self-loathing convinced me I wasn’t good enough and soon she would figure out there are people who are way better than me that she would rather have as a best friend. After some stuff happened I reached a breaking point and told her i needed time alone for a while and disappeared for a month. I made other friends and she made other friends. When i finally talked to her again it felt really strained and i never told her the truth so we just drifted apart and lost contact. I hope wherever she is, she’s happy and thriving. I’m sorry we found each other at the wrong times of our lives but I’m so grateful for all the things she taught me and happy memories we made together. So I guess I’d say to just remember best friendships aren’t easy and you might not be in that place in your life to be that person for someone yet. Focus on becoming someone you’d wanna be best friends with. Take care of yourself, know your worth, enjoy your own company because if you don’t how would someone else? Put out the energy you would like to receive. When the time is right that person will find you."
