The Partisan Lefties in the House of Reps voted for this impeachment (it was the 7th time impeachment articles for Trump had been presented to the House floor...because they in their own words have been trying to impeach him since the day of his inauguration). 

Does anyone notice the Neocons and Libs who have been establishment politicians for 35+ years all hate trump? All the mfers who want more fake wars and a weakened dollar....Pelosi...Romney...Bolton....McCain... Nadler...Schumer....

It's all one club. And Trump is running against them. The Republicans have latched onto Trump because the populist movement keeps them in power. They were smart enough to know that Bush Obama and Clinton were extremely unpopular. (Remember Donald Trump was a registered Democrat for 30 years). He was just smart enough not to run as a Dem because the Democrats candidates are chosen by the DNC and super delegates.  

Thoughts?"

Bass,fd3ooml,t3_ejzp72,1578160353.0,"The fingers and thumb will give different sounds. Playing with your fingers is standard and recommended.

 You see bassists playing with their thumbs usually because they're using a technique called palm muting. Typically used in Reggae and Jazz where they're trying to get a certain feel from the notes of their bass. Thumb and palm muting sounds fat and thick while fingering over the bridge will give you more of a rock tone. 

 At the end of the day making good sounding music that people connect with is the goal while finger techniques are different paths to get you there. The more techniques you master the more paths you can take to get you to that goal. 

There is no ""wrong"" way to play as long as it sounds good unless you're hurting yourself (which is possible). 

Remember Jimi Hendrix played his guitar upside down."
