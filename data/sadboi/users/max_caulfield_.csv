lonely,fquk5id,t1_fqrgkcl,1589660225.0,"Hey, thanks for this really great response. I would cut them out, but it's hard because they're all friends I've had for a long time. The one that I was mainly ranting about I've known since high school, and so there's no way I could cut him off without coming off as a giant asshole. And I don't want to cut him off anyways, I still value the friendship, it's just frustrating that I don't feel acknowledged a lot of times, or bullied into doing whatever game/activity hes feeling right that moment. I just want someone to ask me about an anime I've been watching or a visual novel I've been playing, but the most I get is ""oh that's cool"" and then on to a different topic.

To be honest the only thing holding me back from going is the whole virus situation, and I don't have a job at the moment. But my dream is to move to Japan as soon as I can figure out how to do that, whether it's an English teaching program or another job. That thought is really the only thing keeping me going right now.

Anyways thank you again for responding. Imade that post out of desperation, and it really helped to see someone read through and even responded, it made my day."

Sure, she has an easy kit to learn, but that doesnt mean anyone can play Moira and suddenly be winning all your games. Easy kit does not equal easy hero. You still have to have timing, awareness, positioning, etc to actually do well. Knowing when to heal and when to be damaging, knowing when to send out your orb so you wont just be feeding ult charge, knowing when to ult and how to fade into the right spot so you wont be cced before you can get it off. All skills that have to be developed over time.

I'd hate to see Trump win again but if that's what needs to happen to get Democrats to pull their heads out of their asses and realize they need to tap into the youthful energetic section of their base ('member 2008?), then maybe we could have a party actually representing the people.

Romantic gestures dont stem from the words but the acts, and if hes just saying shit in the moment and not following up, that's just lazy half assed romance. Again, take my words with a grain of salt, I dont know you or him, but as someone who was in a toxic relationship once you have some time and distance from it you realize how much more freedom you have.

I would use this time to really better yourself, whatever that means to you. Invest time in a hobby, learn a language, whatever. I know its not easy to just let go of a meaningful relationship like that, but the more you dive into a hobby or skill, the easier itll be to get rid of those ""what if?"" thoughts.

1. There was audio clicking the entire song, not sure if it was just my phone but it was distracting and took away from the song.
2. I think you couldve mixed your voice a bit better. It came off a bit soft and in the background when it should be the music backing up your voice.

Again nice work, i liked the little details like how you added more voices to the chorus, and the song was melancholy in a nice way. I dont think it's far away from being a professional piece that lots of people would download if they heard it."

pics,f5itgi0,t1_f5ih0i9,1572217892.0,"I'm actually part native american, so I'm well aware what is and isnt a slur. Redskin is 100% a slur, used to belittle and degrade people who weren't white. I saw firsthand from my Grandfather, who grew up in the 30s/40s, what Native Americans faced in this country. So yeah I think it's more than ""on the nose"" to have a racial slur as a team name, and a people as a mascot as if Native Americans are some mythical people and not a real group of people who have been systematically erased and shoved into small pieces of land. It's pretty disgusting that people like you think that's somehow ok and normal"

Make sure you take care of yourself too, if you need someone to talk to I'm sure one of your friends would return the favor. Just keep on being yourself and you'll do great :)"

Again, this version feels boring and ordinary. I didnt feel invested in the character and I wouldn't be interested in seeing more movies based off this character."
movies,f3o4p7l,t1_f3o2wn0,1571008332.0,"I really didn't. I'm not even particularly attached to the Dark Knight trilogy, I mean I liked it but I wouldn't even call it one of my all time favorites. TDK trilogy was just an example of a good character type they could've gone with. I would've been fine with a lot of different interpretations of Joker, I just felt this one was ordinary and dull, that's all. Please stop trying to invalidate my opinion because it's negative."
movies,f3nzyp1,t1_f3nrhu4,1571004972.0,"My expectations for the story was that it would be about a supervillain, not some random person who snaps from depression. You can call my expectations unreasonable all you want, but when a movie spends 2 hours basically making a checklist of ""guy who turns into killer because things go wrong in his life,"" yeah I'm gonna want more than that in a superhero movie. Dark Knight had a gritty and realistic feel as well, but it felt like it complemented the story, whereas here it felt like that's all the director cared about. It's like they wrote the script and then added Batman references to make it about Joker, which I dont like. I dont have a problem with taking a new direction on a character, but when that direction is the most boring, safe route they could've taken, then it's gonna be a problem for me. I mean what of note really happens in this movie? Sure, he kills some important characters, but what does it really say about his character? I feel like I could plug any random misanthrope in this role and it would result in the same story, guy who has bad day gets fed up with the world and kills people, the end. I dont see anything in there that leads me to believe this guy becomes a crafty villain who can outsmart everyone.

I'm fine with being in the minority on this one, but it always irks me when people label any criticism as ""not meeting my expectations for the character."" I didnt go into this with any expectations and prior knowledge, other than seeing the Dark Knight trilogy, which is in my opinion a much superior and interesting interpretation of the character. You can disagree with my viewpoint, but downvoting and saying I had unrealistic expectations is dumb (not saying you downvoted me just in the thread in general). It was a well made movie with a boring predictable plot and a bad take on the character. In my opinion."
movies,f3npdpl,t3_dd0ynj,1571000708.0,"I dont know, I know I'm going against the grain here but I just dont think it worked as a superhero movie. It just comes off as a normal average guy going crazy, not the birth of mastermind villain like Joker. In my opinion Joker should have a craziness that's cemented by a brilliant mind, but it feels like this Joker is just out of touch with reality and delusional. I have a hard time seeing him being a leader of anyone, especially since he admitted that's not what he was trying to do. 

Ialso think it was very heavy handed with its message about society and depression, like I was getting beat over the head over and over ""SEE OMG PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION WERE TREATED SOOOO BAD"". Like what is it trying to say, school shooters should be given sympathy because noone paid attention to them? Come on. 

There were good parts to the movie, the cinematography was good and Phoenix had a great performance of course. But overall it was just a weird uncomfortable movie for me that feels like it had little to do with what Joker should be besides some ham fisted Bstman references. 

Alright I'm done, feel free to downvote me now because I didnt LOVE the movie."
