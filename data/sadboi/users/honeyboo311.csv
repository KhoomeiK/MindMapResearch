This is a historic time we are living in. I’m trying to stay positive - trying to journal and document as much as possible.

Loren has definitely worn the same black ribbed leggings for multiple episodes and Molly has worn the same fuzzy socks and leather-looking leggings!

Be careful though, some of those products have been on the shelf for a long time if they truly are overstock (not all items are) and can possibly be expired. I’ve purchased acure cleanser that smelled funny and was likely expired. Each beautify product should have a life span marked on it. It’s a number inside a simple line drawing of a container."
