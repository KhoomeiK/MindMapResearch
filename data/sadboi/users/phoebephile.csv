I know season 6 isn't a favorite for a lot of people either, but as someone in the grips of some MDD the first time I watched season 6, that was a Buffy I could really resonate with. Buffy was feeling so much that she wasn't feeling anything. She was questioning what her purpose was now that her life's mission had been cheated. There was no road-map for why she was back, why she was alive, she couldn't claim that the PTB knew what they were doing because her friends had stepped in and decided that their opinions mattered more. The Scoobies' avoidance of guilt and responsibility and Buffy's existential dread hit me where I lived, but that was completely *gone* in season 7.
