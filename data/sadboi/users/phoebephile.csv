Wes never gave Holtz Connor, betrayed Angel and left Angel Investigations. Does that mean Wes never got together with Lilah? Obviously she’s still dead in season five, but the last time she was mentioned (to my knowledge, just off the top of my head) was BEFORE W&H altered reality. Wes didn’t start seeing Lilah until he’d left the agency and there was DEFINITELY a factor of rejection and loneliness that drove him to her.

Please correct me if I’m wrong. I haven’t seen season 5 in a while, maybe Wes does mention Lilah."

(well you could technically argue that she caused a rip in their universe and another to get the demon to their universe, but the past is unaffected by the demon.)

If Anya broke her necklace then, I think the demon would go back to its universe, but act of Anya losing her power wouldn’t change the havoc caused.

I know season 6 isn't a favorite for a lot of people either, but as someone in the grips of some MDD the first time I watched season 6, that was a Buffy I could really resonate with. Buffy was feeling so much that she wasn't feeling anything. She was questioning what her purpose was now that her life's mission had been cheated. There was no road-map for why she was back, why she was alive, she couldn't claim that the PTB knew what they were doing because her friends had stepped in and decided that their opinions mattered more. The Scoobies' avoidance of guilt and responsibility and Buffy's existential dread hit me where I lived, but that was completely *gone* in season 7. Everyone was just suddenly there and trying to be a good little soldier for good. That's my anti-season 7 stance."

Then, Restless really pushed the envelope. In Willow’s dream, Tara even says “Dawn’s almost here” or something along those lines.
