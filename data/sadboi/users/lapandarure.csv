AskDID,fpsoitv,t3_gfc3a3,1588876945.0,"i don't have much experience with fictives being formed as adults, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. Actually take everything I say with a grain of salt because I am also not a professional.   
I do find it odd that an adult would be forming alters that often (daily, as you mentioned). They would be under extreme stress to have a new alter being formed. Alters don't just form out of interest. Maybe the movies are triggering them (if the trauma is related to them) and it's causing fragments to form.  It's not healthy to have new splits that often, and some could argue that splitting is never a good sign, regardless of how often it is. Splitting means extreme stress is happening to the system and is causing you to dissociate consciousness to allow suriviablity. Now it's similiar to other forms of avoidance, like maladpative daydreaming or deperseonalization or dissociation in general and some people relay on it more than others, but still...... it's reall not a good sign. What could be happening is they have an (as in one or two) alter who likes to role-play and take on new identities (that's not impossible). A few of my alters sorta blend together and it's hard to tell who is who sometimes, especially the kids.   


 Another thing about fictives is I dont' know many adults who have fictives that are formed in adult hood. This is just me with my limited personal experience, again, not saying it's right or wrong or makes them a liar for having adult formed fictives. Most fictives I have had the experience of meeting are formed in younger years due to maladpative day-dreaming or being really interested in a certain media/topic during a trumatic/stressful time. I didn't understand fictives for the longest time untl I discovered a fictive in my system from childhood, based on an old game that I loved. I have had alters form in adulthood, but all of them were due to extreme stress of that lasted for a very long time prior to my knowledge of me having DID (much like what caused my chlidhood splits). I have had fusions since realizing i have DID as well, so changes to your system as an Adult is perfectly normal. What's not normal is having that many splits that often.   


It does raise some flags for me personally, but not because I think they're lying or not. Either way, this person need professional help and guidance. If you find it too stressful to be around, you can distance yourself. Some people may fake DID for attention, sure, but faking it causes it's own host of issues, and if you need to fake something so serious, something is mentall y out of balance. I hope your friend continues to get the help they need, and the support.   


This is sorta on topic unrelated to this specific friend, but was a video posted recently by multiplicity and me about ""faking did"" and i found it had some really good point in it. might be worth a watch."

AskDID,fo59m61,t3_g5qw8w,1587520519.0,"my seizures were way worse before i went inpatient and learned how to ground in them. my seizures are shorter and more mild now.Prior, i would seizure 2-10 times a day, very violently, ended up in the ER about 4 times and I stayed in the hospital a week to rule out epilepsy.   
i do still have drop attacks and i do self injury.   


Now, with my experience of inpatient and learning out to ground during seizures, i can make the seizure more mild by being more aware prior to the seizure building to the violent stage. Sometimes depending on the trigger that's not possible. Because of my DID, i also can help my parts ground during the seizure.There's still times that I will be in the ground in my front yard seizing for 30 minutes tho if something spooked me just right. Having external prompting to ground myself and cold packs put on my neck can help snap me out faster.   


Internally, i have heard it being called mushy, Swiss cheese brain, swirly. my speech is also impacted way before my body is, and after the seizure, it's much like any other intense dissociative episode. I am very foggy/groggy, confused, and easily manipulated. I have to keep myself safe after seizures just as much as during the seizure.  Also, the fact that I can ground doesn't mean anything for anyone else. I just have had proper support withint 6 months of my diagnosis.   


I also can't drive, i haven't been 30 days seizure free. I realize that's not exactly in the scope of your question, but technically it is in my experience."
adultsurvivors,fo2gz8i,t1_fo0b33s,1587462061.0,"I also want to say that even if you're 22, sex work is riddled with sexual assault and abuse. The impact of this work being done online isn't really wide spread explained either, especially if you were much younger (say 10+ years ago) than you are now. I dont' think many 22 year olds now even appreicate the staying power of information online.   


You are such as much as a valid victim in anything that happened, regardless of age. Did you put yourself at risk by being a sex worker, sure; but that doesn't give anyone the right to force you or manipulate you into situations you're uncomfortable with. There is not big T little t trauma. Trauma is Trauma, Abuse is Abuse."
adultsurvivors,fo2glbv,t3_g4v1ap,1587461633.0,"I was also groomed by online predators into self producing child porn. I grew up with a very real fear of stranger rocongizing me or it hurting my future (I often volunteer with children and they do very extensive background checks).When I was in patient during my last psych stay, a fellow patient said that I shouldn't let the men who may recognize me rule my life. They're sick people and if they recongize me, it will be a very quick and easy way for me to run the fuck away from them and report them to the police. Out of everything that has every been said to me, that has calmed my heart the most. Prior to my hosptialization, I called myself a whore and a slut for what I did as a child, because that's the messages that were given to me. If i didnt do what the men wanted, they abandoned me, and if i threatened to tell, they were ""slut shame"" me. This is common for in person grooming. (edited to add: there are more and more studies coming out that online vs in person groom is identical and has the same lasting effects even if there was no external sexual assault done. The coercion and manipulation is enough to cause the trauma. Your trauma is just as much not your fault as a child being groomed by someone in their physical life. Again, this trauma is just as real and just as much not your fault as any other sexual assualt.)

I do recommend seeking therapy in the future when you can afford it again to help ease your shame and guilt. You are innocent in all of this. You wanted love and attention and it was used against you. You are not the one at fault, and I don't think anyone with a brain would blame you in this case. Please find the compassion to forgive yourself. IT sounds like you're on the right track, at least logitically, by the way you frame your story. You know you were looking for attention, you know you didn't have real support."
AskDID,fnytiyd,t1_fnyr6f7,1587375092.0,"I just  meant that dissociation is a spectrum, and DID is the far right end of it. Most patients with DID will also suffer from depersonalization and derealazation, daydreaming, autopoliting and more and more lesser forms of dissociation. My system also suffers from dissociative seizures. In studies about DID, it's noted that children who develop DID vs those who don't mostly depend on de-attached support systems and the child's ability to already dissociate. Plenty of ""normal"" people drive home on autopilot or do a load of dishes without thinking of it. Daydream off into nothing while they read a book. Sometimes when people have anxiety, the world feels fake and is 'de-realized'. Sometimes it feels like you're not yourself (either in 3rd person perspective or first... like you're watching a movie or the body is sorta acting on its own) and that's de-personalization. All of these are attempts for your brain to protect yourself and are natural to the human spectrum. And of course, DID is a step further, but doesn't mean you cannot have the prior levels as well. 

  
i just meant first person also in regards to that me ""myself the alter"" suffers from this. I normally use 'we' language with my therapist to denote the difference between my system and I to denote ""me,"" the part of the system.  Some of my alters struggle with things that I don't consciously. Like C struggles with OCD. However, multiples of us all struggle with eating disorders, but present in different ways. All perfectly normal and natural with DID.   


It's very possible you could be the only one suffering from those types of dissociation, and it's equally likely that other parts suffer differently or call it something else. My littles call switches ""feeling mushy"" and don't really know that the feeling means a switch is about to happen."
AskDID,fnyl8kc,t3_g4o1gx,1587366608.0,"so, for me, the dissociation right before a switch, i often call it feeling like swish cheese. However, if i have very little communication with the alter i switch into, i have no memory of what's going on. I don't witness it. If communication is higher, i can witness it, but sometimes have no memory. Sometimes, I will have memory if prompted or i will just remember outright. Sometimes I have shared use of the body. It really depends on which alter is ""mixing"" with me and WHY.   


I also still experience first person dissociation (like derealization, depersonalization) on top of my DID."
DID,fntec77,t3_g3ts9v,1587239947.0,"before we knew we had DID, we have a safe place. We have since included that into our inner world. Now we have alters build their own safe place that are included in the inner world. We try to make it collaborative (so multiple alters help build the space, but only one alter gets to be the foreman). we have a lot of out crops in our garden now as a result, and a few ""hidden"" rooms inside. There doesn't have to be a difference between safe inner spaces and safe inner worlds, as long as everyone knows that area is off limits to everyone unless allowed in by who owns it.   


You can start with connecting your safe space to your inner world, or just say you're open to the idea. We built a pathway connecting my forest to the main house. After that, more alters started to built along the river and in the garden as a result. We also hold family meetings which may help communications. in the beginning it was just 2 of us, and now it's at least 9 of us. leaving phsyical notes irl and in your inner world can help let them know you want to communicate, you're open to it, and you want to make them feel safe too."

As far as putting your other son in therapy, therapy doesn't hurt anyone. Even if he doesn't have a disorder, therapy can help. And I do have a few alters from infancy and some of my earliest memories of trauma are from 1-2 years old. (and this is in no way to be offensive) if one of your children has a disorder, chances are, your other child will be lacking in support  at some part of their lives. DID forms from truama and lack of support (just textbook definition) . AGain again i think what you're doing is AWESOME and i'm not saying you weren't there for your kids ever.  
Therapy helps everyone tho, i will say that again, and he could benefit from having a therapist because of the attention your daughter will get with dealing with her disorder. I think most 12-18 year olds would benefit from therapy anyways because that's a scary time in life for most people!

Edited to add: Sorry if it appeared that I was AGAINST fusion. No, I think fusion is a natural process that will happen as you process trauma, as I have had several fusions in my system as a result.

During childhood, the main wants to fuse naturally, and due to the trauma, it learns that the walls between those parts make it self to exist.

DID,fm2li1t,t3_fsoapd,1585699940.0,"First of all I’m sorry for all of the stress you are going through. Does your wife see a specialist for her DID? Many providers are still doing telehealth. Should you not be able to reconcile the marriage, having your wife have a solid support will help your future relationship that is needed for your child to be smoother. 

It’s possible due to the stress of everything she switched hosts, and this host is just more forward. I wouldn’t use that for false hope though because if you were sperated before the switch, it probably had been festering a long time in her system. 


I also recommend you find a provider for yourself. They don’t have to be a did but if they have knowledge of it, it can help you cope easier. If you work things out or not, you need to take care of yourself and keep your mind balanced. There are a lot of options to pick from.

DID,firshig,t3_f9ffur,1582670436.0,"I have found that my parts are either acting in one of two ways.  
1) they're trying to disarm the person because the triggering event (the fight or whatever) caused anger or frustration and this is an old coping skill. You burn the bridge quickly because it decreases the attack. It's a trauma based reaction, doesn't make you an A-hole. What may be helpful if this is the case is if your spouse acknowledges the frustration/anger and agrees to come back once everyone has cooled off. This will give the end goal of pushing said person away without hurting anyone and allow a switch back to the host to happen.   


2) my parts have resentment towards my spouse that they are not able to voice so the only time they get to is when they are triggered out during a fight and they lay it ALLLLLL down. It's helpful if the spouse realizes the fight is probably about something bigger than what is going on right now, acknowledges the pain, and asks how they can help.   


Self responsibility is hard in these cases because you have such strong amnesia walls. This was the case for me and my spouse used to say i would be really vicious and then act like nothing happened a few hours later. (duh, did now that we know). I found the more i felt listened by my spouse, the less my amnesia walls went up. I have a family meeting every night internally to try to ask questions. You can try this with journaling or through an app or thru discord. Find a system that works for you. Often bubbling out and not remembering is normally a sign of pain, minor or big.   


tl;dr It's also really common. Not to excuse it of course, but this is a common issue. try your best to increase internal communication and try to explain when things are calm how your spouse can best support you :) Communication is an issue between every relationship and it's just tripled or quad-tripled by the fact you have DID."

There is also a few youtubers you can watch that do actually use science to base what they're saying. They do a lot og vlogging style videos now but do have a good basis of educational stuff on their channels. DissociDID, team pinata, multiplicity and me,

DID,filkswi,t1_filj8gf,1582503918.0,"I think the major difference between the disorders you listed and DID is that those are naturally occurring thru environmental and genetic inputs into a child's mind while developing in the womb. DID is caused by sustained trauma. I think it's great to love your system and have positive warmth for your system, so i'm not opposed to having a system pride day, but personally I do agree that having a day celebrating the pride of it makes it seem like i'm happy the abuse happened. I can't imagine my life differently without my chronic pain (I also have EDS and other issues) or my system because of DID, but I wouldn't have a EDS pride day either. I would have an awareness day so that people can be educated and the ""she's acting"" line go down a bit.   


It's a really hard weird line that not all of my system agrees on. So, why not have both days and those who feel better to celebrate awareness of the condition celebrate that day, and those who want to celebrate their systems celebrate that day. Humans exist on a spectrum and for sure there should be celebration for every part of it, and that includes the ability to celebrate when/if you want! People created these holidays, people can pick which one they want."

The way a person feels about a rape literally is how a moment is defined in these cases. /she/ was assaulted. Maybe her host wasn’t but she was. I said the blame rested with the host because she covered it up but she was raped. 

She can’t stand the sound of him or the look of him. Classic fucking textbook outcomes of rape. Stop thinking about the “possible consequences “ for the guy and acknowledge the already real consequences for the girl. Don’t offer great support and invalidation in the same breath. 

You can be angry at the murderer and the gun. Especially when they’re both human and not abstract analogies."

DID,fi5fiwu,t1_fi508pe,1582161979.0,"I don't exactly appreciate the language of he did not rape you. You are apart of the system and didn't consent. A part consented and you, co-conscious and crying, were assaulted in the process. 

However, blaming him for it is not where the blame should be. Your system is. Unfortunately this has happened to me where I was assaulted due to the actions of my alters or that I went into ""performance mode"" while sexual acts happened. I dont' entirely blame the the men I was with because I'm sure if they were aware, they would have stopped. Like you said, your crying was covered by sex sounds or shrugged off by the alter more conscious.  However, I STILL FEEL THAT i WAS ASSAULTED IN THOSE MOMENTS. I do not want to invalidate how you feel. Because you feel this way, you feel this way. That is your truth.

Do follow the advice of either very  briefly saying hey, this happened, i'm not ok with it (people change their minds all the time). If he's ok and gives you space, great, if not, get a room, as another has suggested. Just because he paid your way does not mean he gets to rule your body's location while you're there.  I also really agree with system rules in place. AND i TOTALLY agree that you should follow up with therapy."
