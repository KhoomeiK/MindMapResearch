mentalhealth,f9bnn49,t3_e44yen,1575214468.0,"Before starting to read your post, and from the title only, I want to share this, without being exposed to an eventual bias after reading your post :

The more time you spend in the darkness, the higher the urge to feel better by any means is, so IMO, one of non-concious ways to feel better when you feel bad : is to find comfort in your own misery (I couldn't find a softer word for this because English not my first language), and maybe this is why the longer you feel bad, the more you get accustomed to that bad feeling. So, for the sake of feeling any better when it's lasting for so long : you are more likely to accept that it's a part of you, than to fight it.

Now after reading your post :

I'm really sorry to hear your story, also the part, of you being on weekly appointments for 10 years and still couldn't help you, made me feel sad :/

I've had (and still having) also mental troubles, it started since middle school ( when I was about 13 y.o, and now I'm 26), yet, I've never had a single appointment with a Mental Health Doctor, I was (and still) fighting by my own.

I'm into psychology, mental health and personal development as a hobby, and at the same time as a way to help myself, whenever I have free time and when I get the chance to feel kind of emotionally stable.

At first, I was thinking that the mental troubles I had (and still have) are my own and unique fault, despite of doing my greatest best, but I've accepted that It's just ME and it's MY FAULT.... until,

I realized I was wrong, unfortunately and fortunately at the same, I've dug deep enough and got to a point that all my mental troubles along these years, is 70% caused by my mentaly-abusive dad (it took me several years to finally admit it, and speak it out here) and the rest 30% is from some of the malicious society members that took advantage of my weakness and exploited it to hurt me. The deadliest part is that I was the ""blamed victim"".

After this realization, a huge amount of guilt felt off, I feel better, and I feel free from the blaming I got from my dad or even my own self. but I still struggle to deal with the damages I've got, I'm tryig to heal and recover, undo and reverse the dark patterns I've created and received.

I hope this story will help you relate, for my part, it's always a pain relief for me to express myself,it's helping me rearrange ideas, and go further into my journey of self-understanding.."

Firstly, it makes sens because when people get hit by hormones and get aroused, it shuts down any logic reasoning, making you thinking with your little brain only, and after the act, you get back to normal, so your reasoning return to normal and you start worrying

It's hard to control this urge, because the opportunity to get sexually satisfied is so rare, we are afraid to lose that opportunity and never have another one, so without too much thinking we engage into it

I'm trying to find a way to be in a better control (btw I'm not sexually active at all  - but I still think about it in the case an opportunity shows up - and I really want to stay healthy ..)

Secondly, because healthy people are healthier that ill people, this prompts kind of a superiority in their minds, this explains why so called healthy people use that trash language when they've adventured in a risky act, because, by saying that, it makes them feel a bit better and because they thought that thought, they think that this is what's gonna cure them, so they will remain healthy and better than ill people..

Result : he thinks I've learned it, so he thinks that he has accomplished his role as a ""dad teaching his son"", unfortunately in the other hand, I've learned nothing only from ""seeing it"", because it's only with practice that we ""really"" learn.

So what happens next ?

I had often ( and still sometimes have) this deadly idea which is : 

>wouldn't be easy if I just end everything? stop this damn ""surviving hustling"" with one signle action of no being anymore? 

I've been (and still being) mentally bullied by my dad, grew up with a non-optimized mental health, everyday is just harsh for me, stuck between overthinking, lack of confidence, lack of selfesteem, selfdoubting and having impostor syndrom in most of life's aspects, daydreaming about the past and the future and not being able to be present in the ""present moment"".

My long story short : because of long years of mental pain, I've decided to **become morally, emotionally, and mentally stornger, and made it as my life's vision**, I've already started few years ago to take care of my mental health (by heavily investing time into reading articles, watching youtube videos, and having deep selfreflections on mental health and personal development), so, in order for me to finally decide what to do : I wrote the following in my journal :

>Over Death,  
>  
>I choose to live, I'll continue to fight, I'll fight until I win (I mean here I will survive, until I start living).. & when I'll win,  
>  
>I promise to myself, that I'm not going to hold back, I'll enjoy each moment of my life fully, at 101% without any regret.  
>  
>This is my reward for my years of mental suffering, for being patient and for trying my hardest best to survive until the day I'll win

I think commiting to this deal, is enough for me to keep hustling, because I want so badly that reward, I know I don't want to ""end it all"", but rather I want to live ""a fulfilling life""

just before starting to read the body of your post ( as I read the title first ) I had a thought that poped out, so i'm gonna talk about it :

I've had (and still having) mental diffculties, didn't had the chance to see a therapist, But for several years invresting in deep self-reflection, researches into mental health and personal development, I could spot what was wrong with me, be able to label the mental problems I got, and be able to get to the root, or the cause of how and why I feel those mental problems.

during these years,I had (and maybe I still have) that thought like : ""Okay I feel bad mentally, so I need to do things or stuff to feel better, But I guess I won't do anything about that, because, somehow I feel I don't deserve to feel better mentally.."", I think it's just a ""Received idea"" hat I've got at some point in my life, from somebody that wanted to destroy me..

My message is : That's a freaking deadly thought !

Every Single Person On Earth Deserves To FEEL GOOD Mentally !!

So any action meant to improve how you feel internally, MUST be taken (should be 100% healthy, not disguised as a healthy one),

And there has to be no freaking, not even a single drop, of guilt that should be felt doing that !
