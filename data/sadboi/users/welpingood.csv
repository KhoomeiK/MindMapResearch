WomensHealth,fqaabey,t3_ghfnoi,1589215620.0,"Hey! So I went through this. So basically, most of the times women discover lumps- they are benign. Not saying everytime, but most of the time. My lump had certain characteristics that were falling into the malign characteristics, but nonetheless I didn't freak out because during the cycle, women's breast develop lumps. So, I've waited after my period was over, when breasts aren't sore and went to a gynecological specialist who palpated it, also thought it might be malignant and ordered me an ultrasound. The ultrasound revealed that it was benign, however the cells were complex, mixed, and if left it will grow bigger and may turn into cancer. It was a complex fibroadenoma. So then, I was planning the surgery. Visited a mamologist at the oncology clinic (don't freak out about this, it is just what she specializes in so obviously that's the place she'd work), had a puncture done, it confirmed the usg and after some days I had the surgery done, next day was sent home and on the next day I took my bachelor exam at uni. So, the idea is that even tho it can be scary, most breast lumps especially for young females (I was 21) is pretty rare. Several lumps can form during the cycle and they can dissolve by themselves. However, it is your responsibility to have it checked and just make sure that it's benign. So, stay calm&chill and look forward to a usg üå∏üåø"

You'll be like huh... that's all? üòÖ And another thing, you can prepare yourself mentally that obviously the vulva, the vagina are smol pieces that need to be moved from side to side in order to inspect if everything is fine on the outside and inside.

Even if it might feel a bit weird or you might think ""hey, be more gentle down there please"" keep in mind that doctors know that the tissues there are sensitive and they are doing their best to be as gentle as possible.

WomensHealth,fplbyyc,t1_fpk919m,1588709993.0,"Yes, and i just wanted to emphasize the asking for explanation part. Doctors that I met... they don't explain things. They look and just tell you this or that and go for prescription. It leaves me confused and with unanswered questions, curiosity and just desire to see doc's way of thinking and speaking. While I do understand that docs better not waste energy with explaining to dozens and dozens of patients they see daily, medicine is a challenging profession, but still, there has to be this communication between the patient and the doctor. That's why, if you see that as the session is going and the doc isn't giving any explanation or comments and the appointment is nearing its closing, don't wait, ask the doc everything you want to know! The what, hows, whys and so on. You deserve to know about your problem. So don't wait and don't think it'd be awkward or annoying. Be confident and take your health questions into your own hands and ask what you think you didn't get an answer during the appointment. At least that's what I do and I feel great because sometimes I can even put a smile on doc's face after a long day üòÖ"

That's one thing. Another thing is I genuinely think there are no ugly people. I had my mom look at someone's picture (not here lol) and she said ""oh she's ugly "". I was shocked, and exclaimed ""how can you say this jeeeez"" It's hurtful. I see everyone being pretty in their own way. And even if the person has something he/she despises or looks a bit weird or ""nonconforming"" - I see this as something special, ""their own thing"" that nobody else has in the exact same way. I fucking love diversity and how different human beings are and look. It's genuine and authentic. It's so interesting to see these differences, don't you think?

HOWEVER I'd like to help you ease your mind regarding the anxiety. I've had 2 moments in my life when I had tumors and had to wait for the results, thinking it's cancer. And what kept me calm and rational is that, reality is reality. In the end, you've gotta accept what your reality is. There's always a possibility for things to go south. Always. And, if things will turn out bad, well, okay. If things turn out good, okay. Both of these are possible realities to exist. And really, we can't do anything but accept what it is, accept what's real and face the way things are. HOWEVER unless we know for certain that A is A and B is B, there is absolutely no point in worrying and being scared ahead of time on a prolonged period. Sure, the first thoughts about something bad give us first flares of strong emotions of fear and alertness. But, after some time, if you think about it, you know nothing for sure at this moment. Worrying for a future you don't know about... doesn't seem too rational, right? We tend to become irrational when emotions take over. And fear, especially. Oh yes. Fear. The fear of the unknown. It's deeply ingrained in our nature, right? That's why, during these moments of fear and indecision, we should say stop and see things rationally. It's either cancer or either not cancer. Now I don't know what it is, but when I'll find out, I will know. I should worry when I know for sure if it's bad. But if I know nothing right now, rationally, there's absolutely no point in worrying. There's no confirmed base to use for worring. So, why waste energy (and health) for an unconfirmed reality? Whatever the outcome is, eventually you'll get to find out and face it. But in the meantime, r e l a x  and have a chat with the rational you, have some tea together, cook some yummy food together, enjoy it together & look forward to reality and how your story develops. I could do it. You can do it, too ü§òWishing you all the best & peaceful thoughts üå∏üåø"

And I presented it in the front of the class. Got a max grade tho :D"
explainlikeimfive,fmcabiw,t1_fmc8sac,1585941866.0,I think you enunciated a very interesting point about absolute and relative levels I didn't take into consideration. I'm glad you expressed your thought about it
explainlikeimfive,fmc61uc,t1_fmc5eia,1585939575.0,Aaaa how cute. Congratulations on the conceiving I guess :D
explainlikeimfive,fmc4pai,t1_fmc38hq,1585938856.0,"Yooo that's a real thing. It is called ""mittelschmerz"". You can read about it, it's an interesting fact I got to know about earlier today!"
explainlikeimfive,fmc4497,t1_fmc1uyi,1585938542.0,"I think the person who provided the explanation did a very good job. It's not confusing, pretty clear, not too short, not too long, informative, I like it :)"
explainlikeimfive,fmc3skz,t1_fmc2req,1585938369.0,"Nooo, it's no shit! ‚ô° Thank you very much, I didn't really know the fact about the 2 week wait, now it makes sense to me"
explainlikeimfive,fmc3ehe,t1_fmc1unt,1585938158.0,"This. Thank you very much, I got a clearer idea about these 3 hormones during the cycle and how they work"
explainlikeimfive,fmc32cd,t1_fmc1sqq,1585937979.0,"It makes sense about feeling the most sexy before and during ovulation. Since the body screams ""I need to prepare you to give me a baby goddamit"" :D But idk how about you but for me, the way human hormones work, female cycle, the mastermind behind it, the ovulation process- is something I'm amazed of. Seriously. Our bodies work for us in such ways and all we need to do is not fuck up their hard work and cooperate"
explainlikeimfive,fmc2ih3,t1_fmc276b,1585937688.0,"Ooo that's a nice image with different perspectives. Thank you. Hmm, to ""feel"" is such an abstract word tho, it depends what people mean by ""feeling"""
explainlikeimfive,fmc25g3,t1_fmbwrzn,1585937493.0,"Oh yes, I know this one. Indeed a very well-made video"
explainlikeimfive,fmc0rgq,t1_fmbo0q6,1585936752.0,"Hey! Yes of course it makes sense. Your explanation is very good. Thank you so much. I did get a clearer gist of the pattern of oscillating hormones, finally. I did read info prior to posting here so I'm not new to this. So then, technically female body should feel the most ""feminine"" near ovulation and during it, right? Because of the estrogen. Therefore, that should be the phase when our sex drive should be the highest, skin should be glowing and stuff? Because I observed a pattern that happens monthly when after ovulating my skin seems to be clearer. Afterwards it just gets bad before period. Is it progesterone causing it? Which one of them control it? I'd like to know this so that I can cooperate with my body and provide the necessary support aka more healthy eating, nutrients during those certain phases, so to speak :)"
