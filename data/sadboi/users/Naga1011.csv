Advice,fie8zhs,t1_fibzy3m,1582376435.0,"Sorry for late response, I felt asleep. I will actually be heading to do that, just leave my device here at my moms place and move to dads place for a while, actually sounds fantastic to get started on this change. And all you said sounds right, I am already feeling better morally to begin this, later in the day I will talk about this to my mom and I know she will love the idea for sure, thank you so much. I also need to start being more confident on myself again, I’ve lost a lot of trust of my decision making by mistakes I’ve done already, I guess that will get better just by taking this change. Hope you have a nice day and god bless you."

Also, I am really glad to hear that you actually went through this relatively easy and successfully. Oh( and I was considering moving to my dad’s place to see if it helped, what are tour thoughts on that? Should I give it a try, I am truly down for it but I am not confident in myself either I think I should or not. And about my friends, I guess it depends if I will stay here or move and see if it helps me on getting away from LoL and my current lifestyle in general, but I am looking forward to that if not."
Advice,fibvd3i,t1_fibuxkk,1582331014.0,"I will think about that. But Jesus, I felt an actual weird feeling by just reading “delete the game”, I guess this is how addictions make you feel like when even trying to start getting away from them.  Would I come up with ideas on what to do after getting away from it? And how could I get my social life back again ;("
