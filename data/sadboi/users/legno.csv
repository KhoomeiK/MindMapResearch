I would say, however, that *while* I was actually working out (lifting or running, in my case), that is, during the actual exercise, I *couldn't* feel sad (depression) or scared (anxiety). All my focus was on the physical - the burning in the muscles being worked, lungs straining for more air, heart pumping. When I finished the actual work, the sad and scared feelings returned. I remember returning to my car feeling that way.

I stopped about two years ago due to injuries and burnout. I would like to get back into it - maybe with a little less intensity. But I give you a ton of credit for continuing to work out despite a lack of mood response. You may be onto something about the endorphins.

Definitely agree. I worked out 5 days a week for over 5 years, but never got much of a mood benefit, though I worked as hard as I could each time, and did some intervals/high intensity work. What kept me going all that time was a strong desire to fight the depression, physically, not give in to it. And exercise does become a habit - after a few weeks, I couldn't imagine life without it, and planned my weeks around workouts. Eventually I couldn't sustain the big time and energy commitment, and the small, nagging injuries kept piling up, and I just burned out.

I would say, though, that *while* I was running or lifting - during the actual workouts - I couldn't really feel sad or anxious. The focus was all on the burning in my thighs, lungs, or whatever body part I was working. It was like I imagine being an animal would be - all in your body, not in your head.

Also, I've been told several times that those dependent on benzodiazepine medications do not respond as well (or at all) to IV ketamine, so those must be discontinued before infusions. During the 25 years of so many medicines, did you take benzodiazepines at all?

Amazing to read! Thanks again for a real success story. I wish you the very best of continued health and happiness!"
