After my son died, I found his tarot deck. I couldn’t bear to part with it, but I didn’t want to use it, so I smudged it, put it in a bag since he lost the box, and put it away. 

That’s okay to do, isn’t it? Do I have to get rid of the deck?"

Mediums,fqxbngl,t3_gld5z6,1589729509.0,"My family always seems to be under a dark cloud. To the point where I seriously believed someone had a Mal’occhio on us. 

Then my granddaughter was born. We were moving house at the time, my daughter had to have labor induced because of pre-empclamsia (ugh spelling), the brakes went out on my car while I was driving, my granddaughter was born blue after my daughter was induced, and ended up in the NICU after they revived her and, as the final shot of a crappy week, CPS showed up because the baby’s diaper showed traces of marijuana, even though my daughter had not smoked or did any drugs during the pregnancy.

Here’s where I realized that blessings had followed every crappy thing that had happened. 

The house we had moved from was little more than a shack we had moved to in a down time in our life. If CPS had shown up while we were living there, our granddaughter would have ended up in state care instead of being left with my husband and I until the tests proved a false-positive. 

My brakes failed while I was driving home at 2am, through deserted roads, rather than at 5 pm when I was driving my daughter to the ER.

Yes, my granddaughter was born blue, because they had induced my daughter right after I brought her in, but it took 5 days before she finally went into labor. C-Section was out because her doctors felt that both would be lost, due to my daughter’s other health concerns. But the baby was revived within 5 minutes and at 9 years old she is fine, with a mild case of asthma and some sensory issues. 

Then 3 years ago my youngest son died from a drug overdose at 27 years of age. No possible way the universe was gonna get us out of that one. Once again, I felt like I’d been cursed. Believe it or not, a blessing came out of that. My oldest son, who was also suffering from addiction, hit bottom and had to move back home, just like my youngest had done before his death. After a few days he was getting suicidal so he checked himself in to the VA hospital. He’s been clean for 3 years now because it all happened within months of his brother’s death and he didn’t want my husband and I to go through a double loss. Is that the universe blessing us? Not particularly, but something good came out of something horrible, so I’m not going to question. 

So now, when the first shoe falls, rather than wait for the second, or try to figure out who put the mal’occhio on us, I wait to see what good thing will come out of it and somehow something always does."

I’ll be honest- I was relieved! Just to know what exactly was wrong with me and that there were others like me, gave me hope. I’ve never hid that I have BPD, but I’ve never bragged about it either. I’ve joked about it, but that’s just because I tend to have a gallows type of humor. I can turn most things into a joke.

But that’s my body, not the BPD. Any medication, no matter what it’s for, I get those weird side effects that most people don’t go through.

BPD,fprhrhx,t3_gf0tob,1588854470.0,"I’ve told people that I should carry an umbrella around with me, because shit storms rain down on me without warning.  I’ve had to dig out of so many holes in my time, I’ve seriously considered just pulling the dirt on top of me and staying put. It’s gotten to where to when one shoe drops, I automatically cover my head waiting for the next one. An abusive childhood lived in poverty, a shaky marriage, a mental breakdown that at least led to a diagnosis, and, the worst trauma of them all, the death of my youngest son. And somehow I keep moving forward, dragging it all behind me. 

I’m so fucking tired. 

And I’m not saying my trauma is worse than anyone else’s. We all live the shitstorm we’ve been given and it’s not a competition or a race.  Actually, reminding myself that other people have their own crap to deal with keeps the “why me/woe is me” attitude at bay. 

I also tried EMDR, but if you have aphantasia (the inability to visualize), EMDR is useless. 


You know what I hate? I hate when I go through the litany with a new therapist and their response is “how are you still standing?” 

Like, thanks....thanks so much."
BPD,fprgt33,t3_gf3ity,1588853749.0,"If wishing bad things on people makes you a ‘bad person’, then I’m evil and so are 99% of the population. Everyone has bad thoughts about other people at times. Considering some of the stupid shit humans do, it would take a saint not to wish bad things on people. 

One of the reasons I had to give facebook a rest last week and then get rid of people and groups when I went back, is what I wished on a particular group of people and got so angry that I actually posted it to one of them. The fact that I was appalled and ashamed of what I had done in anger is the reason I don’t consider myself a bad person. The fact that you are uncomfortable sharing your thoughts, means you aren’t bad either.

Like I said 99% percent of the population, whether they have BPD or not, get angry and wish bad things on people. Because of our emotional dysregulation, we probably get angry a lot more often (I swear anger is my default emotion, like some people are always cheerful) and we can probably come up with more creative ways to destroy someone.  Beating yourself up for it does you no good. Talking about the anger that made you think that way, finding more constructive ways to express that anger, or ways to avoid those things and people who trigger that kind of anger(I have to do that ALL the time), is better for you.  Don’t be ashamed or uncomfortable talking about it."

BPD,fprb83q,t3_gf3g1g,1588848954.0,"My son died of an overdose 3 years ago. I was clueless when it came to addiction. I was one of those fools who didn’t understand it was a disease. I also had no idea my son was a heroin addict. 

I spent months after his death learning about substance abuse, about how hard recovery is. I spent months beating myself up, blaming myself for his death. For my mental illness being passed to him, for his crappy childhood, for not being the parent he needed, the one he could come to for help. 

Guilt is part of grief; so is anger, sadness and confusion. It’s not making the death about us, it’s working thru all the emotions we are left with when they die. It sounds like, like me, you were left with guilt, with all the “what if’s”. 

Eventually you will come to the place, if you haven’t already, where you realize you did the best you could and there is no point to beating yourself up for what can’t be changed. Until then, yes, your friend’s death is about you, because they are in a place where they are no longer suffering and you are left behind to live with your grief. That’s not selfish, that’s human. 

And, just for the record, it sounds like you had so much to deal with on your own, your own recovery, that I don’t see how you could have been there for anyone else. 

Ignore people who don’t understand grief and everything that comes with it. Until they live through it themselves, trying to explain is like trying to explain green to someone who was born blind( not original, I’m paraphrasing a grief therapist)."

BPD,fpr94vo,t3_gev0vk,1588846879.0,"Music has been my emotional outlet since I was a kid, so I tend to have a soundtrack made up of certain music for certain moods. Some of it is comfort music, like some people have comfort food. It’s the stuff my mom played when I was young, a lot of 50’s stuff and Italian folk music. The rest is the stuff I’ve loved over the years. 

But I do listen to new music, and for some reason that’s considered weird at my age(60). I don’t think what you describe is entirely due to BPD, I think a lot of people just prefer the music they grew up with. But, again, there can be comfort music just like comfort food."

Unless he had a moment of blind panic where he couldn’t think straight, he had no reason to fear leaving them behind.

BPD,fpnqy8p,t1_fpmzzt7,1588770640.0,"I turn 61 this year and I agree. Somewhere along the way, I did grow up. 

Either that, or I’m now too old and tired to put that much energy into other people’s expectations of me. 

But somewhere along the way I’ve become a mature, responsible adult; without having to fake it or feel like I was driving a car careening out of control. 

I’ve also relaxed and stopped worrying about “acting my age”. I don’t try to dress or look like I’m younger, unlike one of my younger sisters who’s on a steady Botox diet, but I’m not ready for the buzz cut and polyester suit. I will play music from when I was younger, but I’ve been known to blast Lizzo in my car, and I still fangirl over Doctor Who and Supernatural. 

So I guess it depends on the definition of growing up. Emotionally I’m probably where I should be now. But I’m not ready to be old yet."

I’ve been married for 35 years!!! It can be done. 

And yea, it is a lot of fucking work, but, BOTH of you have to be invested in it. It isn’t gonna help if you’re doing all the work and the other person is just watching you tiring yourself out. They have to be there to tell you if you’re overreacting to something; they have to be there if you’re having a bad day and just need someone to hold your hand, or leave you alone for a bit. They have to be able to understand your fears and to reassure you they aren’t leaving, even if they have to do it every fucking day until you feel sure. They have to show you that you are worthy of love, especially in the days when you are sure you aren’t. 

“Oh, but that puts so much on the other person.” 

NO IT FUCKING DOESN’T!!!!!

It takes two people to make a relationship work, whether they are both  “normal” or not. Is loving us a bit of extra work? Yes, but we are as worthy of that as any one else!!

Once more for the people in the back: 
WE ARE WORTH IT!

I was married 10 years before we found out I had BPD. It was rough, on both of us. You guys have a head start. You can go into a relationship able to explain BPD from the start. If the person runs, that’s not you being a horrible person, that’s them not being willing or able to become the partner you need. 

Okay, of my soap box now."

AskReddit,fpk2grj,t3_gdn8w2,1588686640.0,"Ignore or belittle their interests and use words like ‘stupid’, ‘moron’ ‘dummy’ ‘jackass’ or ‘idiot’. My kids are all in their 30’s now and I did a fairly decent job of holding to my goals. It’s very easy to fall into old habits when you were an abused child. The cycle is not easy to break, so kudos to those of you who are trying.

Edit to add: and let them form their own damn opinions, even if it disagreed with mine. The only stipulation I had was that it had to be well thought out and proved. I didn’t want them to form an opinion just because it disagreed with me, I wanted them to be able to fight for what they believed and to debate. I know that sounds kinda weird, but, growing up I wasn’t allowed to argue or I got in trouble if my opinion was different from my parents. The end result of that was me avoiding conflict outside of my house and being unable to defend my positions. Because my kids grew up debating with their father and I, they have never been afraid to take on any debate if they know they have the facts to back them up."
BPD,fpiqc70,t3_gdcduu,1588646365.0,"I spend when I get upset or overwhelmed, and it’s caused major problems in the past. Never anything very expensive, mostly thrift stores, groceries or things my kids needed, like clothes, or that they didn’t need, like toys from the dollar store. 

I’ve gotten it mostly under control, but every so often something will come up and I’m jumping in my car to find a store. When it comes up I’ll set myself a ten dollar limit and go to the local thrift store. Nine times out of ten I end up donating back half of what I bought, but the money from that store goes to our local schools, so at least something good comes out of it."
BPD,fpg99nn,t3_gd6fcg,1588597667.0,"The only way to find out for sure is to see a doctor or a therapist. The worst that can happen is that they tell you that it is just teen angst and it will go away. 

I spent a lot of my teen years feeling like I was on the outside looking in. When I was your age, going to see a psychiatrist or a therapist just wasn’t done, unless you had a breakdown or you hurt yourself badly. Finally had that breakdown when I was 38 and it hit hard. I’m 60 now and I wish to god I had been diagnose a lot sooner. In therapy I started taking a close look at all the feelings, all the issues, I had when I was a teen and young adult and so many pieces of the puzzle started falling into place. For a long while I dealt with resenting my parents for not seeing that something was wrong and hating myself for knowing something wasn’t right, but not having the tools to do something about it. 

Try to talk to someone about it, even if it’s just a school counselor (hard during the quarantine I imagine but they should be doing some type of meeting, even if it’s just over the phone).  There must be something there if you are questioning, even if it’s anxiety or depression, so getting some help, asking questions, isn’t wrong.

Edit: took out the word ‘only’."

Outside of those people I don’t form emotional attachments at all. Not that I don’t care about them, but I just don’t have the level of emotional attachment that makes me upset if they leave.

Sure enough, 2 months later her diagnosis was changed to histrionic. She went shopping to find a therapist to give her BPD and when she couldn’t find one, she declared all therapists to be full of shit and now denies that mental illness exists.
