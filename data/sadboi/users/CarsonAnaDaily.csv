Now 21, and while it was really tough during the divorce time my parents never showed signs of anything. Only fought once in front of us. Never badmouthed eachother. And now we go on family vacations together that we never did when they were married. 

Though I did learn my dad is a cheating douche that caused my mom to leave (the first time when my mom was pregnant with my sister and another attempt with my aunt). I sometimes wish my mom wouldn‚Äôt be so nice so I didn‚Äôt have to figure this all out by myself. (I confronted my aunt and she thought I was talking about her. Learned all the affairs and had to vow to secrecy) Not to mention all the money my dad hid away in the 8 years of separation. I firmly believe they waited till I was 18 so I couldn‚Äôt bad mouth him in court, because (I‚Äôm a snoop and read the court transcripts) my dad talked so much shit about me and my mom who raised me 8 years without any help at all.

I planned on moving in with my boyfriend in December, but am currently living at his house from now on because of this incident.. I just dont feel safe anymore.. or worth anything.."
SuicideWatch,f1na6e6,t1_f1n94ff,1569612502.0,"I‚Äôm dependent on family and nobody believes me.. I black out drunk sometimes and fall all the time so it could be argued the bruises are from that.. my cousin is a felon out on parole for meth use and if I go to police hell go to jail for a long time.. I don‚Äôt want to and can‚Äôt afford to loose my family.. because of my mental health (I‚Äôm showing early signs of schizophrenia, have ptsd, severe major depression, and a bad anxiety disorder) I‚Äôm 100% reliant on my family at the moment."

cocaine,evx9m3e,t1_evx10ko,1564885800.0,"No, Iv been diagnosed since I was a teenager."
cocaine,evx0mkh,t1_evwzvqy,1564878537.0,"Not really. Not like I used to. It keeps me calm and happy though, keeps the severe depression and anxiety and panic attacks at bay."
cocaine,evtem12,t1_evtc5kw,1564768743.0,I have access to adderal. B12 like the vitamin??? How do you feel about using weed to calm the cravings and help the brain??
cocaine,evsxlwp,t1_evsw2ll,1564758410.0,This is probably true. It only happens when I use shitty low end coke. The pricey stuff doesn‚Äôt cause my nose to fuck up like this. I should likely quit regardless. Iv been using coke for four months straight ALL day every day until my nostrils literally give up on me.
AmItheAsshole,evn8kfb,t1_evlfn6h,1564620565.0,I‚Äôm a baby born July 10th and I also have no organized sleep schedule! 21 years old... but still sleep like a baby.
cocaine,evl4o7n,t1_evko2eo,1564590314.0,"I don‚Äôt smoke at all. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs had me worried. Iv googled it all night, I just can‚Äôt find anything helpful. The most realistic thing google told me is cancer.... and I just didn‚Äôt want to jump straight to that. I have a doctors appt set. I was just coming here to see if it‚Äôs a possibility anyone has ever had this happen."
BorderlinePDisorder,eveb0m9,t3_cjm0yw,1564461073.0,"I don‚Äôt have the best words, but I really relate to how you‚Äôre feeling. You even put words to how I feel that Iv never been able to put to words before. (Wanting someone to tell me it‚Äôs okay, just so I can tell that person every reason why it‚Äôs not. Wanting to be held, but getting seething anger when someone touches me in a way I don‚Äôt agree to or want.) I agree with the other person who posted. And I just want you to know you‚Äôre not alone here."
BorderlinePDisorder,evea7du,t3_cjll3u,1564460293.0,"It will get better. Just never stop working on yourself. The medicine is a good first step. Medications are complicated and can take a good while to show their benefits, so don‚Äôt stop fighting. Keep self reflecting and noticing that your feelings, while valid, do not completely fit the situation. Be able to apologize to your SO when you get angry out of nowhere. 

I tend to fly into getting really angry and upset when my SO wants to go to bed. Even when he‚Äôs just super tired, my mind just jumps to ‚Äúhe hates me and doesn‚Äôt want to spend time with me.‚Äù I get super angry, but he does his best to reassure me by letting me do whatever I want and hang out with him as long as he gets to lay down in bed to rest. 

It‚Äôll get easier, just don‚Äôt give up on your recovery and growing as a person. You‚Äôre not a prisoner to your emotions."

AmItheAsshole,evbkkiy,t1_evbdwpb,1564381177.0,Cash is always preferred! No taxes on cash tips (most of the time) and we for sure get to take it home at the end of the day.
AmItheAsshole,ev80tu8,t1_ev5b7uz,1564267229.0,"THERE we go. I went into these comments just looking for the reference to the college fund thief. I‚Äôm satisfied, but now very interested in this whole phone debacle people are talking about."
