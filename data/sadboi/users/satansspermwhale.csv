It teaches you to use wording that has you take accountability for your feelings and actions to the other person without verbally attacking said person. So I can be honest in my wording about what my feelings and opinions are without telling them what I think they’re doing wrong. It makes them more receptive to what I’m trying to say if I’m not verbally attacking.

It’s too little too late to stop the trauma. 

This kind of thing so deeply effects people, it is too little too late in a lot of ways. She is a different person than she was before, a survivor on top of being everything she already was IF she even knows who she is. It’s hard to develop a personality when you’re being raped by the person you’re supposed to trust. This woman evolved from a child to an adult ENDURING THIS TRAUMA. It is too little, too late. There’s no argument, the system failed her. Her brain developed around that trauma and it’s going to take more work than the average person her age to help her feel any sense of normalcy especially because she might not even know what that looks like. 

That situation could have killed her, whether it be by her own hands or the hands of someone else and it STILL can.

Kids test boundaries. They never stop. That’s the whole thing with being a PERSON is you have to figure out what works for you and how to orient yourself in the world among your peers.

Do the parents even care about what OP wanted to do or did they just ask because the right thing as parents is to give OP an option? It seems a lot to me like they already knew what they wanted to do for OP’s birthday and whatever OP said they wanted to do was irrelevant to them from the jump.

Just because one cat walks away doesn’t mean the next cat will and it is dangerous to assume you know how this animal is going to respond when you do not know the animal. Maybe you have a cat at home but that cat and this cat, though they are both cats, are inherently different in so many ways. Assuming you know how an animal is going to act is how you get bit by not only a cat, but any animal that has teeth. This is the point the person commenting is trying to make. It’s not an unreasonable thing to teach your children to keep their faces away from animals mouths. This cat is very calm and seems to understand but it’s FOOLISH to assume this is how all cats are going to respond and it’s great parenting if you’re teaching your kids to respect the fuzzy mouth. 


I understand animals exhibit some of the same behaviors and this is partly how we classify them but to assume a cat is going to act the same as the next cat is silly and the fact that there are not more people condoning this with their children is sad. I’ve seen so many reports of kids getting bit by dogs, cats, reptiles. All because whoever was entrusted with watching them assumed they knew how the animal was going to respond to the child. 

Don’t assume you know how an animal will respond. That’s all. Especially not one with teeth. Teach your kids not to assume they know how an animal will respond. 

This video is heartwarming because it reminds me of my cat AND I completely support the idea of teaching kids to respect their animals so when they do come across a dog or a cat that is more aggressive than theirs they know what to do like not putting their faces in the dog/cats face because it is a sure way to get bit by a grumpy cat or dog.


Edit: Lol down voted for calling people out on not being cautious about a child’s life and health? Just teach your kids to respect things with teeth that can bite. Y’all dumb as hell if you think all animals respond the same and this kind of behavior is “okay” no one is bashing the parent, I’m simply stating a fact: TEACH YOUR KIDS TO WATCH OUT FOR MOUTHS WITH TEETH. IF IT HAS TEETH, IT CAN BITE AND WILL DO SO IF PROVOKED.

Edit: also, seems like maybe people are confused about this little concept called atheism. It’s a belief, not a belief system. You cannot compare atheism to Islam or Christianity or any other religion because it is NOT a religion. It’s a belief based on the notion that god is not real. In any way, shape, or form. Organized religion needs a deity. Maybe you should do some research on atheism instead of reading the comments on r/atheism and assuming you are an expert."
MakeMeSuffer,fj6si49,t1_fj6qvuw,1583079207.0,"I don’t like r/atheism because it’s negative and while I’m an atheist I don’t let it define me or my purpose in life.

I think the last reason I went on Wikipedia was for self-regulation since I watch a bunch of emotionally delayed children. I tend to spend my spare time researching child psychology. Things like “how to get your 4 year old to regulate their emotions.” I know, crazy right? An atheist that isn’t obsessed with religion. 

My comment is pointing out how stupid it is to say you don’t understand how x group of people can’t understand your group of people. You’re just pinning x group of people against x group of people. Its okay not to understand something, what is not okay is belittling people who do not have the same knowledge or information you have."

I can’t understand why most Muslims can’t understand that other people think differently from them.

I can’t understand why most Christians can’t understand that other people think differently from them 

I can’t understand why most Buddhists can’t understand that other people think differently from them

I can’t understand why religious folk can’t understand that not everyone needs a giant swirly ball of light holding their hand into the unknown. I can’t understand how being non religious makes me “not understand other people” bc I definitely became non religious and pretty much anti religious AFTER embracing the understanding other people think and feel differently than I. That our society is built off a single religion, a one size fits all kind of deal while we are a literal melting pot. It does not make sense. 

I can make generalized statements about entire groups of people as well except I don’t need a giant magic ball holding my hand for validation the whole time, that’s the key difference between religious ppl and non religious ppl. 

Religion is toxic. That is my reality, but don’t mistake my lack of faith for a lack of understanding."

I can definitely say that their (parents) priority is their career and not the 5 children they have, though they spend majority of their time with their kids they don’t have much patience or energy to properly guide their kids into rationally functioning humans.

Hiring someone to “help” raise your children might be more common than you think. A lot of people want to have them but they don’t want to take time out of their day to explain to them right vs wrong, to properly discipline them without corporal punishment. 

Parents will hire a nanny so they can be the rewarder while the nanny is the enforcer. There are a hundred reasons why parent need to fulfill both rolls but do they consider that before they have a whole soccer team of children? Probably not. Or I would be out of work."

Stop dividing yourself from the other half of civilization by saying your half is hurt worse. The police I reported my abuse and rape to told me to stop acting like a victim....after someone just tried to kill me. Men are not the only ones that are disregarded in times of trauma and stress. 

What is the benefit of this idea that men have more problems than women or vice versa? We need to find solutions to these issues society ingrained in us and playing the blame game isnt going to stop Ben from the coffee shop from slipping Sven a roofie. 

Anyone can be sexually assaulted, there’s really no exception. This is the problem. Rape culture is an inherent part of our society. THAT is the problem.

I used to foster litters of kittens as a kid. Most of them without a mom. It was my job to bottle feed at any and all hours of the day(and then get them switched to solids when the time was right), express their bladders (tiny kittens can’t do it themselves and require help), take them in for vaccines and checkups and pretty much just socialize them so they are receptive to human affection.

Tbh I think I was able to get out of my abusive relationship because I understood this about people and I constantly told myself as his abuse got more and more violent that I wasn’t going to be another statistic. 

Finally built up the balls to leave him and he tried to kill me for it but on reflection I was ultimately attracted to him because I thought he was a “bad boy” and I did make excuses for him. It is what led to our demise.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fikie5n,t1_fikbsll,1582480928.0,"Everyone feeds into stereotypes and I think the “stereotypical bad boy” isn’t one that is abusive but one that does not stick to societies norms. Being a “bad boy” and being an “abuser” are different from where I’m sitting. 

I think a lot of women maybe dismiss their abusers as being “bad boys” because they want to believe their partners are different. No one wants to believe they chose an abusive partner. 

So I understand what you are saying and I also think that it’s one of those things that’s has been skewed. Sort of like the Harley Quinn and joker relationship. It’s toxic and now everyone thinks that the joker is like the ultimate bad boy. He’s actually just insane. They are not “non traditional” they are co dependent and toxic. 


A good example of the kind of bad boy I’m referring to is like Han Solo. He’s a rebel in every sense of the word, is he abusive? No. Not in the slightest. Or how about Hellboy. He’s completely non traditional and physically cannot conform to societies standards, but he’s a nice guy. Just doesn’t float with the rest of the ducks."

It’s not uncommon for seemingly mature men to fetishize young women for their age. I was 14 the first time a grown man made advances at me, when I told him how old I was he said he did not care because my boobs looked 22 and he likes them young anyways. It only got worse as I got older. I dated men that were in their 30’s when I was 19 and most of the time it was just a fling because there is no way in hell a 19 year old is mature and level headed enough to be seriously dating a 30 something year old and these people knew that. They knew exactly what they were doing, but I really did not understand what I was doing. I thought I was doing something wrong, turns out I just needed to date people my age. Took awhile to realize that sometimes people just suck and want to use you for what you have.

Edit: to clarify, when I was 14 and this man approached me I was with my family. I had just been asking for a glass of water and he came over and started talking to me, it did not take long for my mom to see a strange man talking to me. She essentially told him to **** off."

You don’t have to say anything like “I’m not speaking to you for awhile” but letting someone know you are hurt and hurt because of being rejected by them most likely gives them enough information to understand WHY you are no longer in close contact with them. You don’t have to go off, but letting people know you are hurt because of them might be better than just disappearing from their lives.
