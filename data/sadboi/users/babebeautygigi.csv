bipolar,fqv52qn,t1_fqv3h3w,1589670028.0,"My doctor added Welbutrin to my cocktail too. He tried taking me off of my SSRI, but then I crashed so hard and was struggling to find the will to live. So now I'm on both.

Yeah, I'm trying to build a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, which sucks because I have to wake up during the week at 5:30... But once I manage that, I'll try taking the next step and making a to do list. It's a good idea, it's just so hard to actually start and make it a habit, y'know?

Anyway, thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it. It's been about a year and a half since I was diagnosed and my medication cocktail isn't right yet and I'm still trying to come to terms with it."

relationship_advice,foxykbm,t3_ga4gg8,1588160530.0,"It really is devastating when you learn that the person you love and are with is not who you thought they were. Before my current relationship, I had fallen into an abusive one that would have gotten physical if I hadn't left when I did. These people will belittle you and lie to you and make you believe that you're the one at fault. And unfortunately society blames the victim too. YOU got yourself in a situation to be raped. YOU let him rape you. It's YOUR fault. Honey, never let these ""norms"" sway the truth. You made a mistake, but HE put you in the situation to be raped. HE let himself rape you. It's HIS fault. Overcoming victim shame is the very first step to healing. For me, being open about the sexual abuse against me helped me heal, and helped other people realize that they are not alone, and that there is a future of healing and happiness ahead of them. Stay strong. Stay busy. Find something that helps rebuild your confidence, because confidence feels amazing."
