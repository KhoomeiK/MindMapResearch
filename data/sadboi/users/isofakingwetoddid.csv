depression,feuj81l,t3_eqkzx8,1579387022.0,"I’m the same way man. My dad is mentally ill and my mom never puts herself first. I have a parent on both extreme ends of the spectrum. 

I don’t talk to my dad anymore and when I go back home I live with my mom currently. Whenever I go home I don’t like being around her, which is really fucked up to say because she does everything for me: pays for tuition, rent, bills, etc. I owe her everything and she expects nothing in return except for me to graduate (which I will be in May). 

However, my mom has become emotionally attached to me (I’m the younger of two kids) and she is emotionally dependent on my sister. It’s a very unhealthy situation, and now that I’m older,  this concept is much more transparent. Since my dad refused to work, my mom has always worked at least two jobs for as long as I can remember. So throughout high school, my mom was at work, my dad was either laying in bed or passed out from mixing alcohol and Vicodin, my sister had her own social life, and I was alone. 

I’ve gotten so used to it. My sister was away at college when my mom left my dad. While my mom was at work, the day we left I spent two hours sneaking essentials down to my car for my mom and myself. After she got off work, she texted my dad and said they were done. 

My mom always tells me that “we were like a unit going through it together”, but I just see it as me just being on my own and figuring out ways to pass the time. My mom thinks that we’re closer than we really are. Also a fucked up thing to say, but that’s reality

Experiencing my mom’s issues first-hand as I get older changes the way I interact with her. Because she’s so delicate and goes out of her way to do things, it’s impossible for her to ever be calm. 


Sorry for the long story, but you are not wrong or a bad person for becoming slowly disconnected from your parents. If anything it shows you’re changing as a person, and on your way to becoming someone you want to be. That’s not a bad thing. That’s something few people figure out early in life."

Over the summer, I thought I had overcome it, but when I came back to school, it was as if I was back at square one: a bad living situation, new stresses and pressures applied, and it took some getting used to. I have 6 out of 16 weeks left in this semester, and it's finally starting to look up grade-wise; I'm finally feeling mentally healthy after being here since the end of August. Unfortunate and terrible timing, but getting help is important for anyone with depression so they don't stay in the constant loop of depression, and it's working out well.

Even tonight, I don't know why I impulsively decided to take a Xanax bar and have a few drinks; that is one beauty of being depressed and sad: as long as you know you're battling up the hill, you can cling onto the sadness to get it out of your system while you still feel down"

For starters, if you haven't already, take the Myers Briggs test and the DiSC test. The Myers Briggs doesn't test on cognitive skills, it's more situational. But I love taking personality tests. I started taking them recreationally in high school, and they helped me learn a lot about myself early on in life

Also, as you grow up, you realize you're not going to impress everyone, no matter hard you try. And if you do, you're doing something wrong. I've come to learn you can't please everyone, so being yourself will attract the right people you need around you.
