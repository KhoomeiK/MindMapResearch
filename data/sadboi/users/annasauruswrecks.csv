Aquascape,flit8pe,t1_flit332,1585190164.0,I got that from amazon! It’s just a little plastic planter with a suction cup so you can have what looks like floating islands.

cats,fl0mrru,t3_fluxax,1584710845.0,"Sorry, not a larger box. But a different set up for food. Maybe bigger, ergonomic dishes. Or you could just try moving the food/water to a different location."
cats,fl0mnzh,t1_fl0mjuw,1584710768.0,"I mean, I’m sure she can tell it’s not getting burried that way lol. She might be doing that because she needs a larger box. My cats did the same until I got bigger ones with high walls."
cats,fl0mhf9,t3_fluxax,1584710635.0,She’s trying to burry her food. It’s a natural instinct to cover their food after eating.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fl0dxld,t3_flt953,1584702984.0,I’m all in. I can’t sleep.

cats,fkwrxso,t3_fl60b7,1584603232.0,"If you can, I’d get rid of whatever linen had urine in it. If she smells it, she might think it’s still okay to go there. Someone else might have a washing tip though."
Aquascape,fkw5lk6,t1_fkw49ci,1584583985.0,Thanks! Now just gotta hurry up and wait for it to cycle.

bipolar,filuxmq,t1_filum18,1582510946.0,Just remember that you were the person you wanted to be and she was not the person you thought she was. It’s her that’s the problem; not you. Don’t be too hard on yourself for getting invested. To be a person who loves hard is a great thing. I’m the same. But it does set us up for broken hearts in some cases. I’m still hurting a little from my last break up which was more than three years ago. You’re not worthless. You’re totally worthy! You just got mixed up with someone who is wasn’t worthy of you. Take this experience and use it to be a little wiser when getting into the next relationship. Communicate. Communicate. Communicate. <3
bipolar,filubri,t3_f8k36f,1582510528.0,"I’m so sorry to hear this. Breakups are already hard, and then if you have mental health issues as well your bad feelings can be intensified. It’s hard to give and receive advice when you’re in this stage of a break up,  but try to reassure yourself that it’s temporary. You’ll find someone again and that relationship will likely be better because you’ll have more experience. I’m sending you big hugs. I really do know the feeling."
MakeupAddiction,filtln1,t3_f8jufn,1582510029.0,"Hey there! Honestly, for me, I just had to get down and try things over and over. It took a lot of practice. Check out makeup tutorials and try to copy looks from pictures you see. Maybe start out with an affordable brand like NYX or Elf and then work up to premium brands. Let me know if I can answer any other questions!"

shrimptank,fec0rl6,t1_fe84bm5,1578964948.0,I collected over a period of time (expensive!). But cross breeding I haven’t had much success. Since they’re mixed in I usually get wild types which aren’t pretty.

Aquariums,fe6lusc,t3_eo04aj,1578895277.0,Could be bio film. Try laying a paper towel on the surface to see if it soaks it up. Bio film isn’t harmful.
