I haven’t gotten as serious about music as you have (producing my own songs, attaining a following) but I’ve written 8-10 complete songs and I usually post them on social media to share with my friends and family. Besides that I’ve started hundreds songs—riffs, drum loops, progressions, some with words and melodies and some without.

I know exactly how it feels to lose musical productivity when your bipolar acts up. I went through a 12 month depressive spell after my first psychotic episode where I never touched my guitar, bass, or DAW. It was so shitty to lose that part of myself, because when I’m feeling fine I play basically every day.

What is your goal in writing music? It sounds like you’d like to make creating beats and raps your profession if you can.

As for being as good as your heroes; the music and lyrics you create are unique. No one else can write the way you do. If you want to be as good as them and keep writing complete songs, I think you’re going to have to work with your mood state. However you were writing full songs before, it isn’t working now. I think you’re going to have to try new methods of/procedures for writing your music that accommodate how you feel during your mixed phases."

I could tell it was quite far away so the thing must have been enormous, at least two football fields in length.

I remember watching as it slowly ascended straight up, completely silently, then started moving off up and to the right until it got too small to see. Nothing like the way a plane or helicopter moves.

bipolar,f8r2433,t1_f8r09pe,1574730052.0,"Oh, I didn’t suspect at all. But I got diagnosed because I had a full blown manic episode. The thing about mania is you almost never have insight into your own behavior. So I was acting erratically, staying up extremely late, bursting with energy, starting a million businesses (“starting” is a strong word..more like dreaming up), trying to come up with new philosophical ideas... eventually I ended up in the hospital completely psychotic with delusions that I was working for the CIA. 

In hindsight, though, what should I have noticed before my first episode? I’ve thought about that a lot. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder before bipolar, as that half of the equation was more obvious to me. When depressed I felt like there was fog in my brain, my thoughts were less lucid than they used to be, I thought about more sad things, I lost the joy I find in my hobbies and friends, my self-image was totally wrecked, and depending on the severity of the episode suicide became a very attractive option.
Upon reflection, I had one or two hypomanic-to-manic episodes before my major manic episode that got me diagnosed. During those times I got more interested in learning about and developing esoteric philosophy, my self-image skyrocketed to the point where I thought I was a super genius (I’ve got some intellectual game but I’m nowhere near that sort of level and when I’m normal, I know it), I was confident I was unraveling truths about the universe, I stayed up extremely late, neglected my normal priorities in favor of walking around thinking about life, I drank WAY more caffeine as it fit my mood so well, I became more charismatic but simultaneously annoying to talk to as I’d never shut up, and everything became what I’d call more ‘salient’—everything felt very visceral and important and special to my life. Everything felt meant to be.

bipolar,f82cd39,t1_f828bpj,1574188447.0,"I was talking to my psychiatrist and they said that people with bipolar tend to be on BOTH tails of the IQ spectrum, either abnormally high or abnormally low. There are less average intelligence bipolar people than there “ought” to be.

I think curiosity generally is correlated with intelligence, but that doesn’t mean people with more mid-range or even lower IQs aren’t ever curious about these topics. You don’t have to be intellectually gifted to think about those sorts of questions, but you might be more drawn to it if you find those sorts of topics easy and even fun to work with.

I think the deeper thoughts thing is a good point, more intelligent people probably do have deeper thoughts, but be careful—I’m not sure being more intelligent means having deeper feelings! It’s not like your whole reality is sharper/more clear or anything like that. At least, I don’t think so."
bipolar,f82bt7f,t1_f828fo2,1574188138.0,"It’s fascinating. The thing that makes me happy when I get overwhelmed by it is that consciousness was always in-built into the universe. It’s not like it was an accidental byproduct of physics—it IS physics, in a way. It’s the universe acting itself out. And yet there is no place in the math of physics  for consciousness. There is a definite quality to being aware and alive, just like there’s a quality of mass in matter, but it’s not something we are able to measure. And that is a part of the universe, and it always was. It’s baked-in.

The discrepancy is really annoying. The best way I can describe it is that I come up with complex arguments at a sub-lingual level, but often it’s hard for me to express them in words. Also, it’s difficult for my brain to stay on one subject for an extended period of time. Meds help, but it’s still a struggle.

 I  get overly involved in philosophical thoughts, especially when I’m hypomanic or manic. I get really into esoteric philosophy and lose track of the important things in my daily life.
I do this sometimes when I’m stable, too. Especially with respect to the emergence of consciousness in biological organisms. That fascinates me to no end.

I’m very curious about most things, so I end up asking tons of questions. I think this is off-putting to some people who don’t want to take a deep dive into a subject.

I struggle with lack of motivation, too. While I know I am capable of getting work done, I often develop this mental block around actually committing to it. I think being capable scares me, because I don’t know what will happen when I succeed? Idk hard to describe.

I’m kinda socially awkward. I don’t get jokes sometimes, not sure if this is related to intelligence but it bothers me."
