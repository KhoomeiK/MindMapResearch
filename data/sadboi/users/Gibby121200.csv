These ones happened to me in February of this year. I was walking through my kitchen in the middle of the night and this ominous dark orb floated from around a corner. It was really dark, i couldnt even see the wall behind it. It was about the size of a basketball id say, and it was maybe 5 feet from my face. As you can imagine it scared the hell out of me, so i calmly walked backwards into my room but kept my eyes on it and as i did it kinda just melded into the shadows and vanished. Thats probably the scariest thing thats ever happened to me in this house

Similarly my sister told me that in February she also had an experience. She was in the basement grabbing some toilet paper (my moms one of those hoarder types, so we keep it in the basement) and she said she heard what sounded like one of our cats running down the stairs (they werent there). When she went to go check to see if the cats had followed her down suddenly a white orb flew down the basement stairs and disappeared as it went under a table (why did i get the scary black orb but she got the white one?)

So yeah, pretty freaky. Ive also heard tapping on the walls, a chair in our basement somehow moved far away from where it shouldve been on its own when nobody was looking, and a container my sister uses for painting fell off a table on its own. And this was all just in February, but activity seems to spike and then die down for a long time so its not unbearable to live here lol"

And yes, tickets are much more impactful to the poor than the wealthy. But that doesnt mean we should steal money from them. Im not sure how it works wherever you are, but here we have a point system. Getting tickets will put more points on your license until it eventually gets revoked. Thats something thats an equal punishment regardless of class.
