Set yourself up for a good life. It doesn't matter whether or not you ""deserve"" a good life - you fucking want one, so go out and take it. Your life might not be good right now, but it will be if you get everything ready for one.

Your ba kind of doesn't matter in most law enforcement. So it might be best to finish up your animation degree and then go into law enforcement. By best, I mean fastest. And if you want to be a police officer, you don't really need an internship, you need the police academy. 

If you want to go into something more specialized, an internship might be worth it, but you should think about what specialization you want so you can target those internships. But again, I know someone pretty high up in the boarder patrol who has a ba in history and didn't have an internship. So I'm not sure how much even specialized law enforcement cares about what your undergrad is."
careerguidance,fc63oc7,t3_egampl,1577471547.0,"Have you tried applying to other NP programs that aren't accelerated? NP and PA programs are also pretty difficult to get into, though. 

I also think it's a good idea to go for rn programs. Where I live, there are associates programs that can get you done in 2 years. It might be easier to go back and be an NP after you're an RN. 

Don't beat yourself up. These kind of programs are extremely difficult to get into. It's not that you're a drooling incompetent moron, it's that you're trying to get into very difficult programs."

Personally I'd take the $15 an hour to pay the bills. Or I second what someone else said about basically finding a job that has benefits to tide you over while you do the online thing. If you can get into an entry-level job for what you're going to grad school for, that'd be best. 

This is a temporary phase in your life. Do what you have to to pay bills while you're going to grad school."
careerguidance,fc5zsyb,t3_egd4e6,1577469201.0,"I'd include it and stress any transferrable skills to your new job. 

Either way you're going to have to explain that gap. I think including it and saying ""I thought I wanted x but once I got there I realized I would like my career to go in y direction"" is easier than making something up for why you quit your job and didn't work for 3-4 months."

Marriage,fc5sm9k,t3_eg3d53,1577464953.0,"It's fairly common for married couples to keep finances separate. I know a lot of people who do it that way, it cuts down on arguments about what was purchased. I mean, you see your friends spending their husbands money, but you don't see whether they argue about those purchases later. 

In your case I'd definitely encourage you to keep finances separate. The fact that he gets defensive and won't talk about finances makes me wonder what he's hiding. If you want to jointly save for a big project, you could open a shared savings account to keep those savings in."
Marriage,fc5rzl9,t3_egau76,1577464563.0,"If that's what she wants, then that's what she wants. 

It is so annoying to me that people feel the need to stick their noses in other people's lives! If your wife is happy doing all the housework (and it sounds like she is), then it's not anyone else's business! 

I'm going to guess she'll probably want more help when the baby(-ies) come, but for now, let her be. If/when she seems stressed out from the baby/housework, offer to help and say stuff like ""I really don't mind helping, I'd like to help, I want to help."" 

Personally I would hate this arrangement as your wife, but guess what... Different strokes for different folks. Don't let what other people say effect your marriage."
datingoverthirty,fbha0qr,t1_fbh7vlf,1576868751.0,"So the neighbor guy 1) lied about his age and his name online and 2) didn't tell me he had kids before I met him (also my fault for not asking) and I don't think I want kids ever. He's a nice guy but we don't have a lot of music or interests in common. I have a ton in common with the other guy, similar sense of humor, texting and hanging out with him has been super natural and comfortable. We have ""the spark"", whatever the hell the spark is. 

I think you're probably right about him finding out eventually. Honesty seems best in this situation."
datingoverthirty,fbh8u55,t1_fbh6jcn,1576867965.0,"That's fair! I'll admit I'm probably being paranoid worrying about him freaking out. I did a stint at Legal Aid and I saw a lot of DV stuff, and he's just so close physically to my home. 

That's good advice! Thank you :)

Edit to say; I honestly don't think he will freak out. But worst case scenarios and all that."
datingoverthirty,fbh4yuj,t1_fbh3hiz,1576865416.0,"Yes! Exactly, thank you! He's the first Fwb situation I've found that gets it and there's no issues. 

I see what you're saying, I agree about keeping people on the hook. I don't want to be cruel to him. Thanks for the advice!"
datingoverthirty,fbh34kn,t1_fbh29r4,1576864337.0,"Ohh that's fair. 

Well honestly I'm not ""serious"" with someone else yet. We've only been on 3 dates but we have a ton in common. I want to give this guy a fair chance and I think it's gross to sleep with someone casual when I want a real relationship with this other guy. 

But there haven't been any exclusivity talks or anything like that. After 3 dates, it could easily fall apart so I don't want to totally burn my bridges."

EDAnonymous,f8xemch,t1_f8x6fuv,1574916383.0,"Well you could also try a small plate at the third place. That's a lot of food for anyone though! 

What about

""This is my third dinner, it's just not going to fit"" (humor to diffuse the tension!) 

""It smells super delicious but I already ate Thanksgiving twice""

""Thanks but I'm full from the last 2 places we went""

""Thanks but I had a huge plate an hour ago""

Also if she presses more than 3 times I'd be like ""why does this bother you so much? I already ate twice."" Like fuck OFF lady. 

Are you going to hit the actual dinner for all of these? You might be able to get out of eating I'd you miss the 20 minutes eating takes."
