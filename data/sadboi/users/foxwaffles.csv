I am Chinese American with heavy monolids so I made an Instagram to share monolid makeup looks with others who are having trouble with theirs. Growing up I had basically ZERO resources of how to do makeup for my eyes and so now that I've finally become somewhat competent doing makeup on myself I want to share my looks so others can have some inspiration. I have both natural/daily and super colorful looks and I do a good mix of both. I love colorful eyeshadow looks. I do a mix of falsies/mascara only 

My skin tone is fair olive. My best match right now is PMG foundation in Light 2. I have dry skin and my biggest concern is flaking and dry patches as well as very dry undereyes. I have clear skin otherwise, and it's 100% genetic, so I don't talk much about skincare. My skincare routine mostly just focuses on hydration.

I use mostly high end makeup and some luxury products. I am beginning to travel down the indie hole. Then the other 25% of what I use is Korean or Japanese makeup.

I've also begun replicating YouTubers looks I see online to show how they can be adapted to monolids. Finally, I am a full time kitten foster so I also post a LOT of kittens from bottle fed babies to the crazy zoomy ones!"

I use natural hair fude brushes, the one random natural hair MAC brush I managed to acquire, and also the Esum packer brush (can't remember it's name at the moment) and I get much better results. Mel Thompson did a demo comparing PMG with her nicer brushes vs her cheaper synthetics and I highly recommend giving it a watch.

As for the special more baked glittery shades, you're not the only one who has had issues with them being itchy. Unfortunately she does use glitter particles in them and while nowhere is it indicated that it's not eye safe it's a super gray area with whether it is or not.

Few notes:
It has a very subtle amount of micro glitter but it's not obvious on the face and doesn't look glittery but it's there.
It doesn't really fix your foundation so if you're combo or oily I don't see it holding back sebum very well. It just prevents foundation from transferring really, while still letting the skin look glowy. So that's why it's so great for dry skin
I use this all over my face but I prefer different undereye setting powder (right now I really like the PMG undereye powder)
It has a beautiful finish. It's not as blurring as a matte blurring powder but it softens the skin and gives a beautiful glow that doesn't emphasize pores."

My sister has a petite frame and naturally has a lower BMI (will not disclose) plus she does ballet so she's very fit, and it's warped my perception of a normal weight so badly that I am thoroughly convinced I'm a fat whale. I feel awful because it's not like she's trying, that's just what she maintains, but of course my depression brain is like hey don't you want a side of body dysmorphia with that order of self loathing? 🙃"

Getting the same thing but this time about my body. I never work out and I never have to make dietary sacrifices to he healthy. I'm slim because I'm Asian!"

BeautyGuruChatter,fppltdp,t3_geu90z,1588804662.0,"I'm personally really excited. As a Chinese American I'm always feeling let down by how southeast Asians are just forgotten about in the western beauty community (unless it's for token ~kbeauty~) so I'm always looking for more Asian owned brands to support and follow. 

Kloud Face as a brand had the concept of being between the worlds of skincare and makeup. What do you think?"

Not having to wear a bra half the year is awesome and I wish we could all do it!
Lolita,fppjupc,t3_gequ4t,1588803614.0,After classical puppets went down the drain in terms of quality MLT is THE place for pettis now and it's well worth the price. I've had mine since 2018 and they're perfect. She even has advised me on which petticoat to get and how many layers when I sent her photos of my dresses! And they were perfect!
Makeup,fppjn3h,t3_gep5eh,1588803501.0,"Never had a single problem. Her brush tip eyeliners are freaking amazing. Her lip products are absolute winners, the infinite lip clouds being the real crown Jewel of the brand. Her baked blushes are so good, that palette is so soft and beautiful on the eyes. The serum blushes are beautiful on the cheeks but are held back by bad packaging but it's worth overlooking. The only thing I haven't tried is her brow range but I've heard nothing but positive things about her brow gels"

Instagramreality,fpfc7xq,t1_fpeqf1l,1588567084.0,"The biggest indicator of bloating is your tummy feels hard, not soft/squishy. So it's not indicative of actual weight gain but it feels painful (I feel overstuffed and full and it hurts) and it looks like I'm pregnant and none of my bottoms fit and it can be really difficult to deal with mentally. I am extremely prone to water retention (thanks dad) so every other day I'm bloated beyond belief and there's just nothing I can do"
