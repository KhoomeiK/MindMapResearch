AskReddit,fpwdfv9,t3_gffps6,1588961506.0,"My son had health problems since birth. He was on all these different medications and was barely feeding. When he was 3 months old we noticed his arm wasn‚Äôt moving. We took him to the hospital and they pretty much laughed at us thinking we were over reacting. 

Took him to the doctor and the doctor says well sometimes babies break their clavicle at birth let‚Äôs get him x rayed. Well. It turned out his arm was broken, a small spiral fracture. 
The doctors at the hospital assured while I bawled my face off saying don‚Äôt worry sometimes when they are sick they are frail and they have tiny bones maybe when you were dressing him he got hurt. 

Well the next day I get a call from child services and so begins the worst 3 months of our lives in which we were interrogated by police. Tried to force us into confessing we hurt him (which we never would it took us a long time to even have our boy.) We had to go to embarrassing abuse centres where everyone looked at us like we were monsters. Had him taken away from our home. Had him x rated about 50 times after that (he probably will not have children after this.) 
Everyone thought we were monsters. Made us give him a cat scan accusing us of shaking him. He wouldn‚Äôt stay still so they tried to strap him down. He wouldn‚Äôt stay still so they put him under. 

It was an absolute nightmare. When you are on the end of this and know, and everyone who loves you knows, you would never ever do something like this, it is simply the worst nightmarish reality to be in.
