I'd love Ori and Will of the Wisps. I played Ori and the Blind Forest and it was such a beautiful game. The soundtracks from this game are my all time favourite. The gameplay was also very smooth and the story was amazing. I believe even some tears fell off my face after I completed the game. I expect the same experience from Ori and Will of the Wisps.
I have broken my arm three weeks ago because of a faulty bike from my work and gaming is pretty much the only thing I can do.
