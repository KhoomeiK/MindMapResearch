Get your A+ as it will open the entry level doors. I‚Äôd recommend Net+ as basic learning as well. Past that go whichever route you want vendor wise. Keep in mind you may not go from help desk to server or networking.  Be open to taking detours on your way as they‚Äôll enhance your overall learning. 

Knock as many certs out as you can (but wait to take net+ since it‚Äôll renew A+). Within my almost 6 years of IT experience I‚Äôve gained Net+, one Microsoft desktop win 7 and one win 10 cert, and the MS server 2016 MCSA. Put your mind to it and anything is possible within reason."
