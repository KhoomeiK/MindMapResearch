gay,fo5iei6,t1_fo5e5lh,1587526395.0,"yeah but it’s anxiety over a recurring thought, i’ve have it multiple times before about similar things. usually it takes a few days to a week to get over, but this time it’s already been 6 days and it’s not showing any signs of getting better. it’s also a lot worse than it has been before and it makes me feel sick a lot of the time so i’m really struggling. i don’t have anything useful to distract myself with so i’ve just been watching a bunch of tv and i feel like shit for doing it but i’m getting back to online school next week so hopefully that’ll make it a little better."
