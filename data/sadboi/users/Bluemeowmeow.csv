Dogtraining,f9tcv0p,t3_e6sq6p,1575617776.0,"Tough transition from puppy food to adult. Hills Science Puppy checked out to be okay. Assumed that he would be fine with Hills Science Adult, Sensitive blah blah. He was bloated, sluggish along with dry shedding coat. I felt horrible. Tried different brands. Then, I gave in and tried Acana, limited ingredients duck and pear. Bloat was gone, and his coat recovered. 

He eats about 3 cups a day. Sometimes he doesn't eat all of his food by 7pm and I pick up his dish. And his food is set back out in the morning. 

Treats, biscuits, carrots, apple, watermelon, kong with a bit of peanut butter. Mozzarella slice. Plain Greek yogurt. All in moderation. 

Upset belly
Add a spoonful of plain canned pumpkin or plain ground beef with white rice boiled. 

I do my best to keep him happy. He is 80lbs at 2 years. He is a pit,lab mix."
