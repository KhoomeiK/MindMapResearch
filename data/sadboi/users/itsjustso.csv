Got a reflective mask for the front of my face that I can see through. This will be for underneath to make it look fuller. Still, not going great, haha."
BPD,evnd1ow,t3_ck6gty,1564622825.0,"I think I hear my name so often or my place of employment to the point where I think everyone is whispering about me or laughing at me. I also have very intense sleep paralysis monthly where I'll eventually wake up screaming and/or sobbing thinking someone or something is next to me or in my apartment. I'm also convinced someone is always looking into my apartment, spying on me, keeping tabs on me. It's been going on for years but has gotten especially worse in the past few, which exacerbates my anxiety so much."

I can't even count the number of times I thought ""Wow. Are you me?!"" reading through this sub, so to hear it back feels really validating. Thank you for that, and congrats about your not-smoking, molly-free, healthier eating developments. I'm also trying to cut those things down. It not easy. But you're killing it and deserve to feel good, even if it generates negative thoughts as a result. Push through them—you got this!"
