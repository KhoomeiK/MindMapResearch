“Remember when Star Wars Rebels (2014-2018) took the tired, age-old trope of “guy continuously flirts with girl who clearly isn’t interested until eventually he finally ""wears her down” and they get together"" and flipped it around by having Ezra STOP flirting with Sabine very early on in the show, and instead of shoving them together just because they’re a guy and a girl in the same age range, they developed a beautiful, solid, sibling-like friendship where they trust each other with their lives and make an incredible team and it NEVER becomes romantic because it never HAD to because a good friendship is just as meaningful as a relationship?
