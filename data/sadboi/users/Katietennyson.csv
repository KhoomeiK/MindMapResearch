schizophrenia,fb1pz42,t3_easwzs,1576439569.0,"I was unmedicated for six years except when I was in the hospital when I was given risperidone injection for a few months. I managed to live my life those six years and didn't really have much in the way of  bothering by spirits etc. Did have some paranoia and did have psychosis once a year. Now The 2 1/2 years I was medicated the first year on one meg of risperidone ended up with brain damage when I tried to taper off it I can no longer use the web, type, read, look at things properly my whole cognition and brain is completely fucked now. I'm far far more disabled and non-functional now than I ever was six years Unmedicated. The drugs also block the pathway to the frontal lobe so you don't care about anything and  neglect yourself.I felt so utterly void emotionless spirit less and dead on the drugs. I only realise that now after being off them it's like the whole animating force returns. 

If I could go back in time I would never ever have touched them, the medication I mean. I read hundreds of studies where they state that those who never started medication did better long-term. I should also add that the drug sensitise the receptors so much, when I came off the drugs after being on them I was absolutely flooded with spirits and problems I've never had the six years I was unmedicated. I think they ultimately make everything much worse by sensitising the dopamine receptors should you have a chance to come of them you will have massive problems far far worse than before you took them. Be very very glad that the doctor is being cautionary with the drugs and starting around only on one meg, Every brain is a rare make and model and these drugs totally change the brain learn everything you can about them.These drugs are not even 27 years old we know nothing about what they do to us long-term"

I'm usually in for three months. But when I go into urban hospitals I only stay a few weeks. You will be medicated if you are in hospital it's usually compulsory.The medication can be really detrimental. For example my first psychosis was really mild I didn't see anything, I didn't hear much it wasn't that big a deal. After being medicated very heavily at the hospital and coming out a few days later my next psychosis Was extreme, seeing seeing lots of people saying things all over the streets. Hearing gunshots go off just like being lost in a dream. I think the medication really altered my brain. You can't say no to it. Maybe if you are voluntary it might be different. It's very routine in hospital, you pick your meals every day on a menu, hopefully have your own room. If you're not currently in psychosis you should be okay.It's a safe place if you are really in crisis. I like going to hospital now because I feel safe, because I don't have to worry about anything and can just draw or write or read books I don't have to worry about my life.You will probably also make friends there. People just seem to understand you a lot better there.

 Clearly she saw something  in your notebook that was worrying and required hospitalisation. Don't worry it's really not scary . You will have a lot of support. Get your family or friends to bring you any snacks, colouring books, books etc and the radio maybe. Make sure to pack something warm to wear because it can get very cold inside these places. You'll probably have to give up Electronics like your phone etc etc any iPads. You can't have any sort of dangerous object even shoelaces etc anything that can be used to suicide or harm."
