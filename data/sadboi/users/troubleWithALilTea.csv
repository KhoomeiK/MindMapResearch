First things first, and as a male I'm somewhat lacking in full understanding here, but! read into how autism affects women vs men. Lots of books out there, and most of the FB pages concerning autism state that it affects each ""original gender stereotype"" differently (given chemistry, estrogen and testosterone probably do have diff interactions as effects the body and thus brain chemistry at least somewhat differently, let alone the sociological raising being completely at odds with respect to how most raise boys vs girls). This may help understanding, also you must remember that each of us has different tics and potential diagnoses as for how the spectrum interacts with us (add, ocd, physical sensitivity, etc), I've met all kinds of expressions on how autism affects people."

These and more have answers that don't have to be dealt with in that way, I understand a bit about these at least.

I will not say that life ending on a voluntary choice is wrong, some diseases and possibly other reasons have the power to move even a fellas heart even as the survivor from a family members suicide. And should you choose, i am not in YOUR ""shoes"" and have no judgement after because I cannot Possibly know what is in your head and heart.

But, and that last one gets me even if it doesn't lead to suicidal thoughts for me. Sometimes a person can get so locked up in a mental loop that the answer You need can be Right in front of your face and you would have no way of knowing... (e.g. I get hyper-focused and have litterally ignored glaring danger in pursuit of my objective at that moment).

You might can find your reason for only one more day, and that's enough sometimes. 

For me, suicide is my last option, it's already happened that we lost one of us to it, and there's no way I can bear that thought even if I know I won't care after. Just the fact that one of them is still around will likely lead to me being the last MF alive. Thats My reason, I hope this is something you can get past, and I hope you find enough good moments in life to make it worth it."
