Anxiety,fpmi9c6,t3_ge8lip,1588733662.0,I basically pick the cuticles off of my thumb and pinky finger. I’m so fucking tired of doing it. I’ll hide my hands when I do it so my boyfriend doesn’t see me.
Anxiety,fpmhgyp,t3_ge9mhl,1588733171.0,"My heart hurts to read this. I want to cry with you, and give you a hug. it will get better. I am trying to push through crippling anxiety right now, and I find it weirdly therapeutic to read this sub. Growing up was a shit show for me. I remember the pain, feeling unwanted by family, hating myself, fantasizing different lives I could have had. As hard as this may be, try to imagine your father as a child. How was he raised, how did his experiences mold him into the man he is? At one point my mom was a sad, scared little girl too. I try not to personalize the way she treated me."
Anxiety,fpmg2l8,t3_geaees,1588732303.0,"I’m 35 and flung a bag of crackers across my kitchen the other night because my anxiety was so bad. Alone. Then slammed the fridge, bottom condiment shelf broke, condiments everywhere. Slammed it again. Broke middle condiment shelf off. Sat down and cried for 10 minutes. No one saw me but I was so ashamed I couldn’t keep it together better. I actually went to the dr this morning about medication. Your family’s support could be really beneficial. But if they still give you shit, don’t take it personal. Mental health is so misunderstood."
Anxiety,fpmf8v5,t3_geapef,1588731785.0,"I moved away from my hometown for 6 years, and it was a nightmare for me socially. I was convinced I had turned into a different person, that something was wrong with me. I was so lonely. I’m really sorry you’re feeling that way. There are good, easy going people out there that probably feel the same way you do. I hope with my whole heart you guys find each other."
Anxiety,fp8qb5n,t3_gc11o9,1588399535.0,"I fucking feel you. I’ve got an appointment Monday to try and get some anxiety medication, but this quarantine really messed me up. I’m starting nursing school in the fall, was supposed to anyways. All this shit happened, had to drop a class, every small task feels like a fucking Boulder. I’m so irritable, that I overreact at nothing, then cry hysterically because I’m so embarrassed. I’m not eating well. The obsessive thoughts about everything I wish I was better at is what hinders me the most though. No advice here, all I can do is relate. I really mean it when I say I hope you get feeling better."

CBDOilReviews,fk4lro6,t3_fg1550,1583862953.0,"From personal experience....yes. I have failed and only used CBD. It was a 0.03 bought legally in TX. Failed a UA, could have suffered serious consequences. If you have something to lose by failing, please don’t do it."

DMT,fjllczt,t1_fjlkfmq,1583448900.0,"I know, I wanted to but I got scared. They said everything looked ok right that minute, but I need to get bloodwork done, make sure there wasn’t any damage. Troponin test, or something like that."
DMT,fjll5pq,t1_fjlksyw,1583448777.0,Bought it
CBD,fcrcs45,t1_fcorlps,1577900091.0,"I failed one as well for THC, you should show your doc these posts. The benefits outweigh not taking it, especially for someone in recovery."
CBD,fcrcduw,t3_ei4npf,1577899936.0,"Lazarus Naturals only. I’m a student, so I’m in the low income program, it’s a lifesaver and by far the highest quality tincture."
CBD,f9jpfhw,t3_e57mrb,1575382306.0,"No problems ever, great product great company."
