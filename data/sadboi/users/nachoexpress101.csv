bipolar,eseforc,t3_c7c7mv,1561897004.0,I had a faight ...well it wasn't a fight but my partner got mad at me for giving a person who rents off of us a free month off this coming December.. we talked about it months ago and both decided it was a great idea for an incentive to keep this fellow because he has been such a good renter... Well it has put me in a bad spiral and I stopped that one med Abilify about a week ago and I was feeling great but now this incident just seemed to trigger something and I can't sleep now ( never experienced this no sleep thing) so now I'm going for a drive.
