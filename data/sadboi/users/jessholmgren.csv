BPD,fautq85,t3_eamo04,1576352546.0,i feel this. i feel like i go numb more often than i get angry tbh. the numbness is almost like my default in a way. it’s sometimes when i feel the safest because i can’t feel anything at all. idk if that makes sense but yeah
BPD,fabcz5j,t3_e8chmg,1575921329.0,this happens to me a lot! i’d say i go through this cycle like every few days/weeks. it goes from being super motivated and trying to better myself in every way i can think of and then in a few days it’s all over. if it even takes that long sometimes it only lasts a few hours. i pretty much always go back to the negative energy. i just stop caring and nothing seems like it’s worth trying anymore.

Borderline,f62f1wb,t3_dlxj8j,1572658333.0,"hey! 
i’m diagnosed with BPD and i was in an on/off again relationship with another girl who had BPD for about a year. 
i’m not gonna lie to you it was a very difficult and toxic relationship for the both of us. but neither of us were diagnosed and didn’t know how to handle our emotions. i’m sure with the proper treatment and help in guiding your emotions throughout the relationship it would work out just fine! 
wish you the best of luck and happiness!!"

ect,f27j3xj,t1_f27d4z7,1570039366.0,thank you so much! i’ll talk to my doctor and just for you’re own mind i am trying to quit nicotine it’s just a lot harder than it seems. i’ve been addicted for over two years so just quitting isn’t as easy as it seems. but i’m definitely slowing it down!
ect,f25mffy,t1_f25mdcx,1569978234.0,okay thank you so much!

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,eu3wzfm,t1_eu3wsk2,1563428437.0,it’s not really like that. i’ve been dehydrated and stuff like that and it was like only in this room every time we went in there and only there.
