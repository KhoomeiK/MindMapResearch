First thing was the shadow seemed kinda unnaturally straight and the top half of the head is visble giving the impression that the guitars neck is caving inward while facing forward yet the body is slightly at an angle (giving it a kinda twisted look) 
Keep practicing and don't give up
I draw a bit here and there but i never stopped
You'll only get better if you keep going and challenge yourself! Good luck!"

Existentialism,fk80q3o,t3_fgyxbe,1583947175.0,"Honestly i'm in the same boat as you my friend, but looking to existentialism for help is like asking a junkie to get you off drugs. Sure it might work, but more than likely you're gunna find yourself involved in something that if you don't ""understand"" could wreck your perception of things. I live for absurdism myself, however we always need a fine balance or these things and optimism. Too much a good thing vs too much of a bad one, if you catch my drift. Be well"
SuicideWatch,fk7zf8k,t3_fgvoys,1583946484.0,"If ya smoke or drop acid often i've found taking breaks clears my head. Read your own post and pretend it isn't yours. What advice would you give yourself? 
Personally i'm rooting for ya and if you need to let go of your girlfriend then it's better then fake love if it isn't really there. 
Best wishes my friend"

Good luck friend"
depression,fbm2ue4,t3_edxaxl,1576976885.0,"Honestly just try to do something, do you have somewhere to stay? Start with that. Keep fighting ( it sucks) and if you can't find people who you can get along with then just keep moving with your life. Be the best representation of you without being a major asshole to the world, people respond better to kindness, just don't trust everyone until they give you a real reason not to."
depression,fbm2lco,t3_edtpfg,1576976683.0,"Means ya gotta find something youre good at or can become good at, I couldnt tell ya but if life isnt leaving you fulfilled find some other shit to do it. 
Super bland and not very helpful but as ""smart"" or ""clever"" as i might be, I still work makong smoothies at a fucking grocery store
Life is what is
Ya gotta make more out of it
Find something ya enjoy and learn/practice the shit outta it 
Might make smoothies but I can play some bitch'in guitar and that frankly keeps me happy enough"

depression,eyt9vie,t1_eyt8jkk,1567430388.0,"Hey man all I can tell you is to take charge with you life. It's fuckin hard but i was so passive in my past relationship and it ruined it. Having self confidence and trying to keep busy not to over think shit is hard but it's the best way to do it. I still have a lot of shit to do myself to keep my life together and it's fine to cry ( i do it all the time) but it can also be taxing on people. As far aa the cheating aspext goes, it's up to you to decide if you want to move past that (I wouldn't due to the massive mistrust i would have as the person I am) or move on. I can only say I hope things get better but being alone and finding the right crowd will make life better.
Chaging jobs, living situation, city whatever to start new life is better then living a life that is dead on the inside, to me at least. Be strong my friend."

It molds into my day to day and become a bit better sometimes. It doesn't seem the way but life could always be worse. Find your goal my friend, then find another. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to every once in a while, but life goes on with or without us.
