dating,fnx4ies,t1_fnx4e5a,1587331316.0,Lmao yeah I’ve been getting into so many hyperfixations I can’t keep track of all of them. Thanks for the suggestion hahaha
relationships,fek02i1,t1_fejo4hk,1579189716.0,Aw man thanks a lot. Normally after I’ve left or broken up with an SO or a friend I really start to miss them afterwards but not this time I’m so sick of her reading so much into everything I do just to find excuses to hate me. I hope I’ll move past this soon.
relationships,fejzw36,t1_fejq2s7,1579189606.0,omg HAHA I wish I could do that!! but I’ve blocked her on literally everything and what’s funny is that she’s been trying to get back into contact but nope bye. hopefully that speaks for itself as much as you worded it so beautifully. I really don’t have time to chase after her shit anymore whoops.
Advice,fejotqz,t1_fejoa5p,1579181936.0,Thanks. I blocked her on every platform so she doesn’t have a way to contact me. I’ll definitely be practicing drawing boundaries and self assertion lol
Advice,fejoppk,t1_fejofnj,1579181840.0,yeah good to know I’m not the only one who thinks she’s crazy. Blocked her on everything.
jobs,fde8woj,t1_fde8ny6,1578333757.0,Well for me it’s different on reddit as it’s a platform where I’m anonymous whereas Facebook or Instagram is based around irl social circles and relationships. Thanks for your opinion on linkedin!
jobs,fde6p9h,t1_fde5stb,1578332377.0,Thanks for the detailed reply! I agree about just having an account just in case. Not very many people I know have a linkedin and I was curious about the kind of environment and platform it operates on and it sounds strictly professional so that’s good. I’m quite young so forgive my naivety :)
jobs,fde3oci,t1_fde142s,1578330472.0,Thanks for your really informative answer! I’m not going to be working in a field where having a presence is super duper important but it’s good to know about different industries and whatnot :)

depression,fa07o40,t1_f9zmqx7,1575750107.0,Same thing with the teachers. One even forced me to apologise for being too “negative” sigh.
depression,f9ykvip,t1_f9xio4r,1575730051.0,Yeah I get what u mean das how I felt too :/ Hope everything works out for u dude.
depression,f9xfdoh,t1_f9xdt5l,1575710483.0,Man toxic work environments are the worst. How’s it going now? Are you planning to leave soon? It’s so irritating how “positive” is lumped into a category of smiling all the time and being happy so everyone around you will be happy. Gotta do things for yourself too and hope the car dealership knows they’re hiring u not the other way around lol
depression,f9xcbx2,t3_e7b052,1575708784.0,I believe in you. Totally know what it’s like to feel super alone and like the whole world is against you. Really wished I had somebody who empathized and would’ve made a world of difference. I’m rooting for you dude- you’re not alone.
depression,f9xc2nb,t3_e7b64o,1575708645.0,Feel you. I would rather have no friends than fake ass ones who lie to me all the time. Mine in the last two years of high school posted ~inspirational~ and positive messages to emotionally manipulate me into feeling like a shitty person. So I cut all of them off. I’ve been there and I really hope ur feeling better and start hanging with people who deserve ur attention.
depression,f9x9azm,t1_f6r299a,1575707107.0,literally had the same situation as nobody around me took my well-being seriously. I also get bursts of resentment and lots of anger sometimes w those people but I’m trying really hard to let it go. It was hard. Glad to know I’m not alone. Hope you’re feeling better.
depression,f9x8q9q,t3_dsgdf3,1575706770.0,Dude same. I hardcore felt this way in high school and it was worse because people in my school told me to shut up and stop being so “exhausted all the time” “live laugh love” and “be grateful for all the opportunities given to you in an education.” Like bruh... I didnt HATE school at first but their toxic positivity and fear of anything negative made me fucking despise it all year. Your emotions and thoughts are valid as hell and don’t let anyone tell u otherwise lol. Sending lots and lots of hugs your way. I really know how it feels. I hope you feel better soon <3
relationship_advice,f9u1iks,t1_f9tp7y7,1575642708.0,Thank you for the reminder <3 this really helped. It’s hard because he kept telling me to be grateful for him and be positive even though I was going through a really bad patch in life so I feel bad whenever I am sad or angry

Advice,f9thr9j,t1_f9th5wi,1575624918.0,Thanks for the advice kind stranger :’ the worst part was that he involved all his friends in our relationships and so I’ve had to block them too. Really hope reminding myself will ground my reality.
AskReddit,f6jjq9v,t3_drgc5q,1572895754.0,"not a teacher but a story from my family friend who teaches 

there was a girl giving a guy a blowjob in a closed off room used for private studying w at least five years between them. They didn’t notice there was a mirror and everyone outside could see everything reflected in the glass

at least 10 kids from 12-16 were outside in a queue videoing what was going on. My family friend walked past and was horrified to say the least

I felt so bad for the both of them :/"
TrueOffMyChest,f6fk7m8,t1_f6d2cvo,1572815296.0,"Don’t worry dude- I understand your analogy. It makes a lot of sense why you would feel this way! The fact that you haven’t passed this abusive cycle onto your son is incredibly inspiring imo. I still consider myself a kid at 19 haha but I always have nightmares about being a bad parent to my child. Just by providing what you can for your son is a big fuck you to your parents; their abuse doesn’t define you, their abuse will never define your legacy. My mom always likes to say we can’t choose how we’re treated, but we can choose how to react and there’s a solution to everything! You got this.

I’m no expert, but I think you could benefit from perhaps going for counselling whether it’s emotional/for your own trauma, or the prospect of getting a job or ANY means for you to move the fuck out of your parents house. Blood isn’t always thicker than water. I know it sounds so so difficult, but also channel your anger into something productive- take a college course, some kind of apprenticeship, even just small side jobs that will make you feel like you’re making an effort without actually straining yourself too much. From then on, think bigger. If you have any setbacks, well- if you’re going through hell, keep going! Doesn’t mean you fucked up completely and have to start all over again. 

If you have any negative, intrusive, or just plain overthinking about your parents, I’ve had to deal with the same kind of shit emotions recently (not about my parents but other authority figures haha). My therapist suggested a method; vent for thirty minutes on a letter and rip it apart, then focus on your senses, where you are physically in the moment, or your happiest memory. Say, your son’s first words or something! Think about what you saw, touched, etc. It’s okay if you hate your parents. When they treat you like shit, ignore. As tempting as it feels, try not to be vindictive. Walk away like the better person you are with your son. Punch a pillow. Work your fucking ass off. Find ANYTHING to do. Nothing is EVER set in stone. But one day, you won’t have to. You’ll move out the door and just completely *nothing* them. You won’t live in the past anymore. Trust me, I know how hard it is to let go of anger :’) what matters the most is trying to be a better person, not how people are “good or bad”

Thank you so much for your kind words, OP. I really hope I’ve helped you with your situation! My situation is similar in that I’ve dealt with verbal abuse and sexual harassment from friends and schoolteachers. I know it’s not the same, but in a situation where I was expected to fully embrace my education I was called negative and ungrateful too. I get how shitty it feels. I get how fucking maddening it is. I know it’s good to have all the opportunities in school- sort of my metaphorical food and shelter as you said, but that DOES NOT warrant abusers to have any kind of entitlement or involvement in your life. Your emotions are valid, but you’re stronger than any anger or depression. You can and will claw your way out to a better life. Pain of growth > pain of staying the same."
FriendshipAdvice,f6fg2lz,t1_f6eg9ta,1572813934.0,"Haha fam I was in the exact same position in Senior year!! The whole time I just felt so overwhelmed by people- you’re not alone. Don’t make the same mistakes as I did and feel like you have to interact with them but take time for urself 

I’m really happy you have real friends in school!! I wasn’t in a good state my last months of high school and all my real friends were back home- they really do make all the difference. Keep hanging out with them <3

Advice I think: don’t be afraid to be yourself. Even if that means not being stereotypically popular or going to every party. If people don’t like you, that’s fine, because not everyone will. seeing as you’re in senior year you should be confident by being yourself bc everyone will move onto different lives regardless: The people who truly like you for you are meant to stay in your life- you know, like the cheesy those who mind don’t matter quote HAHA If you gained confidence through ur own identity atm it won’t just shine through now, but you’ll retain that confidence THROUGHOUT life

Thank you for your kind words OP <3 believe me, I totally know how you feel. Except I used to think confidence meant being the best in senior year. For a time, as stupid as it sounds, I was the stereotypically popular girl. I quickly learnt I was more alone than ever. Making friends and socialising and everything else does have to come from your heart; do what you like to do. Only make friends with the people who make you happy. It sounds selfish but take it from me as I gave pieces of myself away I wish I never had HAHA oof

Don’t overthink it. What’s meant to be really will be. All the best for senior year and college apps! <3"
TrueOffMyChest,f6ahtti,t3_dqqsry,1572757094.0,"I don’t know if you’re going to see this, but I just wanted to say you’re so incredibly strong. 

I’m younger than you at 19 years old. When I was growing up I never really questioned my family or how hard their lives really were. But when I reached 18, I saw what the truth was really like. I’ve had several friends whose fathers and mothers have gone through many of the things you’ve mentioned. So from another son to another father, I wanted to say that you’re already successful in having already tried. You’ve quit drinking, drugs, taken care of your child when you were feeling at your lowest. It may not seem like it but life will get better, no matter how slowly it takes. If you’re capable of changing yourself, you could reach out for help. Even if you don’t want to, just think about doing it for your son.

Don’t beat yourself up, please. As for your abusive father- is there a way to move out? What’s been happening? If you ever need/feel like talking, drop me a DM. Sometimes at 19, life feels overwhelming. You’ve gotten through 100% of your life at 27. You’ll get through 100% more of the days to come."

FriendshipAdvice,f618a5s,t1_f6179fp,1572635344.0,"aight you never have to see them again if you don’t want to!!! HAHA

also idk if I’m wrong but assuming it’s college app szn right now in the US this is gonna sound corny but honestly just focus on improving urself whether it’s grades or skincare or spending time w ur family! Not saying friendships don’t matter but in the long run these people won’t even be involved in ur life from the sound of it. And it’s ur life!! Ur not responsible for making anyone else’s better

One thing I liked to think about was that the “bad period” of high school (2 yrs give or take) is literally less than 5% of ur life. Assuming u live till 85-90. Not to sound negative but It really doesn’t matter at all if you don’t want it to. Don’t feel like u have to like it all the time. It’s just one tiny step in life. 

best of luck <3"
FriendshipAdvice,f616wbi,t3_dpo86i,1572634506.0,"sup. I’ve definitely been there HAHAHA and don’t feel bad for ranting. It’s not wrong to feel this way because high school is a long time (esp since 8th grade?) and it’s natural to outgrow people in this stage of life.

If it helps, something similar happened to my friend group too. They only liked me when I was supporting them- If I wasn’t or if I was supporting somebody else, they’d turn on me so yikes. Please don’t let them treat you badly :-( slowly and respectfully stop involving urself w their bullshit. I’m not saying friends have to support each other ALL THE TIME but it’s wrong when the balance is off if u get what I mean hahah 

If u don’t mind me asking, r any of them planning to stay together after grad?

I graduated high school having made few but very good friends. I completely cut off my main “popular” friend group out of my life after. I felt everything you’re feeling now and it’s still hard to let go of my anger sometimes, but don’t pressure urself into staying in contact just cos everyone else is."
FriendshipAdvice,f615cm3,t3_dq5nwz,1572633466.0,"heyo firstly I hope you’re feeling better <3 I’ve definitely been there as well :’)

If you have old friends that you had healthy relationships with, I think you should try reconnecting with them. It really helps because you at least know some semblance of the person and imo would ease any past anxiety you had bc of your toxic friendship! You don’t have to immediately start making plans, but baby steps even just commenting on Instagram pics, replying to their stories, are a good foundation to build on! There’s also some distance between you and them so the friendship won’t escalate too quickly into an uncomfortable situation you’re not ready for

Other than that, I would say it depends what stage you are in life eg it would be easier to form groups in college or school, but I’ll try to give u some good general advice hahaha

don’t forget your own boundaries. If people are truly worth having a friendship with, they won’t walk all over you and they’ll respect what you’re comfortable with (within reason HAHA). If you’re upset about something they should also at least consider their actions even if they weren’t intentional and not be indignant about their views, and the same should apply to u as well!! TLDR: friendships exist on GIVE AND TAKE

Also I would say real friends don’t have to talk all the time or be super exclusive or hate on the same people to be good friends! 

EDIT: Of course I’m only one person who has a toxic friendship and they can be all kinds of toxic lol but I hope what I learnt can be applied to u!! 

hope I helped and good luck !!! :~)"
FriendshipAdvice,f613r41,t3_dq0iry,1572632416.0,"okay I’ve literally been in your exact situation. I know how it feels like everyone knows them and likes them, but I swear it’s not going to actually be the case!! If people judge you or turn on you for quietly assimilating out of the friend group- then at least you know who not to make new friends with.

I would say definitely talk to your nice friend more! Try to get to know other people in your classes/extra curricular stuff! But remember it’s always about friend quality > quantity!! If they’re already treating you badly, I don’t see anything wrong with wanting out and from what u say u definitely don’t seem like the kind of person who would wanna make a big deal out of it :-)

when I left my friend group quietly one of them got mad about it six months later (which was ... weird). But I was already in a much better place w a better friend so I didn’t really bother. pain of growth > pain of staying the same

Hope it works out for you <3 one thing that helps is to remember high school is literally 1% or less of your life. Assuming u live to 90"

Was friends w a “popular” girl at school who was pretty much the same way u described lmfao. I disconnected gradually but still remained pretty polite and friendly to her and started talking to new people and we remained acquaintances but still got along relatively fine. But the worst part was a YEAR after that she suddenly TORE into me and listed out all these reasons I was a shit friend and turned the “popular group” against me when nothing had happened. Later I found out she was just jealous that I’d made closer new friends.

She acted like she hated me, but then cried and sent me a heartfelt text when I graduated. I still remain close to the other friends I made during my six years of school there.

Weirdest friendship ever imo. It hurt like HELL back then but it’s a good laugh now"
FriendshipAdvice,eqny9oo,t1_eqnxucs,1560181758.0,"No I wouldn’t.
