I graduated hs, went to college. Sophomore year, I'm waiting for a bus, when all of a sudden, there he is. We were the same age but he was a year behind me due to a couple rehab stints. He was sober. He'd gotten into religion and thought we were destined to be together. I...thought about it, he's great in a lot of ways, but it was A LOT, so once again, nothing actually happened.
