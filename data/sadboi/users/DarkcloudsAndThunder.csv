depression,fb67fu0,t1_fb66ok9,1576543269.0,"I told him I didn't want to take drugs until I tried other things like talking to a therapist. But my family doctor gave me a 7 day supply of Trintellix in case I reached a point where I wanted to try. The funny thing is, and I've told my doctors this, I had accidentally medicated myself. What I mean by that was I had started taking a workout supplement called Creatine. Well, that supplement had a secondary ingredient called L-tyrosine, which can have positive effects on treating depression."
depression,fb64mdz,t3_eb0ggo,1576541262.0,"Yeah,  for me it's like hitting pause on the movie of my life. I get a breather to take a piss, and then it's back to the regularly scheduled program."

I'd shrivel myself up into the smallest person I could be and  I would have thought about doing stuff like putting his used cream pouch into his coffee cup or pants pockets.  Or setting up a web camera over my bed to broadcast and record everything that happens on it and show it to the world. Or sprinkle either itching powder and/or hot chili powder over my sheets while leaving dozens of printouts with instructions on ""How to Get Rid of Crabs/Bedbugs"" all over the room.

You may not feel better, but there's a certain degree of satisfaction that comes with making someone who deserves it feel worse.

Yes, I can be the king of petty and small and spiteful. :p"

depression,f8rtp1e,t1_f8r92ee,1574752694.0,"One thing I just recently started using is creatine. It's a workout supplement that you can get anywhere. It's non-prescription. I found it gave me a boost in mental and physical energy. Not in the sense that I was hyper, but when I needed energy to do something, I could summon it up. It might be something to try other than the hard stuff. 

Do you have hypo or hyper thyroidism. Sounds like hypo. I have a friend who went through radioactive iodine to treat hyper. It made him hypo and getting the drugs dialed in has been a struggle.

For me, when I was getting diagnosed and I wasn't receiving any treatment, it was one of the most terrible times in my life. It gave me a really good look at what the limits of my mental endurance was, and I got a good glimpse at what real and serious suffering was.

I sincerely hope you can get the medicine dialed in and working for you."

depression,f8pok5i,t3_e1jd2d,1574704813.0,"I had a hyperthyroid issue, but it was before I realized that I was depressed. To be honest, I'm not sure how it affected my depression, if at all. Thinking back, for me, it may have even helped with it, because I had something more immediate to be concerned with. It also gave me what I felt like was a more socially acceptable reason to avoid situations that I didn't want to face. I used it as an excuse to not go to a wedding.  It also gave me an excuse to avoid work.

I went on drugs for a couple of years, and I got very fortunate. The issue stabilized, and my thyroid function went back to normal. It was about a 30% chance of that happening.  But the physical after effects lingered on longer. But after a long haul, I physically recovered."

For me, In these imagined worlds, there's like you said purpose, but that purpose is obvious, where there's clear lines between what's right and wrong, where good always triumphs in the end, and there's always a way to get there.

Real life isn't like that. Each of our stories is messy, unclear, and there's not always a nice ending where we get the guy/girl. Often it leads to heartache. And there are dead-ends everywhere, with no way to get to where you want. 

In these worlds, everything is simplified and paths are easy to see. There's little to no gray. Even in heartache there's joy, because there's always hope around the corner, because that's just how things work. There's always a happy ending."

Right now, you don't have to be happy for her. You just have to try not to do or say anything you'll regret. 

Things have changed, and change can be scary and unsettling. Now it's just a matter of seeing how things will settle and how your lives fit together in this new situation. It's a shame that she's kind of abandoned her old life, for now, and doesn't see how it's affecting you.

For me, the pain doesn't necessarily go away. It fades. I accept the truth that it's there. I figure out a place to put it, because it's a part of who I am, just like it's a part of other people."

You can choose to forget her, or you can continue to be a friend and be there for the kid. Has she indicated if she's fine with you still being in her and her kid's life?

Yes, you're hurting. But I've found that being a friend sometimes means putting yourself second, even if that friend isn't being the best of friends right then and there. This doesn't mean you let yourself be walked over or be taken advantage of. It just means you do what you think is reasonable. She asks you to babysit. Reasonable. She asks you to help this dude move. Fuck him. You got a shit eating contest that you'd rather go to. 

A long time ago, I was hanging out with this girl from work all summer as friends. Didn't realize I had feelings for her until she started to see someone. I told her how I felt, but things didn't work out. She's married to that guy now. They have kids. We managed to stay in touch, and now, go out for lunch every so often. I'm happy for her. In hindsight, I'm not sure things would have worked out if we did get together. But I still have that summer. It was fun while it lasted."

depression,f7ygrsm,t3_dy58ui,1574094772.0,"The other alternative is to tell her how you feel. And that you just realized how deep your feelings went when she started to see someone. Ask her if there’s a chance for anything more. If not, then at least you know, and you can move on. And make it clear up front that you wish to still be friends because you want to be involved with the kid if that’s fine with her. 

To stay silent is to breed regret and pain and will eat at you like a cancer. Opening up may create a great wound, but it will heal with time. But if you’re lucky, things may work out. Maybe it’s a small chance, but it’s better than no chance if you stay silent."

One of the things of the things I'm doing in addition to improving myself is I realized I needed help. I reached out to my doctor, and I'll be seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist soon. Doctor wanted to prescribe meds, but I decided to hold off for now.

Though I'm feeling better, because I'm finally realizing what I'm dealing with, when I look back on my past, I see now that I've always distract myself from the way I'm feeling by giving myself missions to do, whether that's self improvement, or improving my environment, etc. Right now, I'm wondering if the missions I'm on right now are 100% the right thing to do, because I'm not really dealing with my problems. I wonder if I'm just putting a cork in them, and over time, the pressure builds up until it blows again.

I'm really interested in what the psychiatrist and therapist are going to say."

My goal is something long term, but if I met someone I clicked with, and they only want something short term or casual, I wouldn’t necessarily be opposed.

For example, I’m looking for a therapist right now. There was someone I considered a friend. We’re not super best buds or anything, but we’ve hung out one-on-one many times and are in the same circle of friends. We’ve known each other for almost 20 years. 

When I was looking for a GP a few years ago, they pointed me to their doctor, which was great. Earlier this year they were getting treatment for anxiety from a psychiatrist. We’ve spoken about it openly. I emailed them the other day simply asking if they were seeing a therapist in addition to their psychiatrist. And if they were, did they have a recommendation because I was in need of one. 

All I’ve gotten so far is radio silence. I can understand if they’re not comfortable talking about that. And I understand they’re still going through stuff. But they could have given me the courtesy of just telling me to fuck off because they got shit to deal with. I’m a really easygoing guy. I could deal with that and take it in stride. 

The non-reply—I don’t know—it’s like I’m not even worth pissing on. Maybe I’m being over dramatic or over sensitive but... if the roles were reversed, even with all the stuff going through my head, I’d at least reply."

As for how to handle it, I've found in situation's like this with rumors and stuff, it's best to just roll with it in terms of not letting it get to me. You can't stop the rumors. So just try to be Ok with them flying around and live your life as normal. If someone asks, just tell the truth. The other dude kissed you. The more you protest, the more fuel you feed it.

You can turn this in your favor. It's like a friend filter now. Those that still treat you like a normal person are probably people worth knowing. Those that give you shit about this and try make you feel bad, those are the people you don't want anything to do with. Best to keep them at a distance, whether that's with rumors or bear spray, it doesn't matter as long as it works.

If your ""friend"" is a guy, too, here's a vert dramatic and Hollywood sort of revenge you can take. Go to his current school, and when your ""friend"" is in class or in a very public place with people he knows, run up to him cryig fake tears, and say ""You said you loved me, and that we were going to get married. But you used my body and left."" Then give him a wet, sloppy kiss and run away. 

If you got to deal with rumors at your school. Now, they have to deal with rumors, too. :p"

Not my first rodeo. Been bucked off the horse before. It was nice not to get kicked in the nuts this time. But still, got a little blue, which wasn't unexpected. But then it got worse.

It's all smoke and mirrors to distract myself from what's going on inside. I get to feel good about having a purpose and accomplishing something.

If you have no aspirations of being published. It doesn't have to be good. It just has to mean something to you. It's just another way to vent and distract and deal. If you are even playing with the idea of publishing, it still doesn't have to be good. The more you write, the better you'll get. It's just like any other skill. 

FYI, my favorite book on story structure is called Save the Cat. It's a script writing book. There's also a novel writing version Save the Cat writes a novel. I'd recommend either or both, and their companion books Save the Cat goes to the movies, and Save the Cat Strikes Back.

I didn't realize it then, but I realize it now. I got blue because it was an ending and I didn't know what to do with myself next. I'd worked so hard.

If my head is blank, I just write my head is blank. I just write down what’s in my head that second and how I’m feeling right then, not about how I was feeling a minute ago. Do that enough and it gets a little easier. I’ve found it’s about being honest with myself."

While thinking of ways to... well... you know, I was thinking maybe I shouldn’t leave a note. I should set up a fucked up scene and make a mystery like in that the Taman Shud Case. They’ll find me. I’ll be wearing pink soccer cleats, a tux, and a baseball mit. I have a copy of War and Peace next to me and a copy of Twilight. each will have a random word highlighted on each page. A piece of paper will be in my pocket with the phrase “Uncle Bobby likes the midnight fried chicken. And the April fool comes on Tuesdays. Break the code and the treasure...”

Right now, I've been wanting to punch myself in the face for thinking the first thing, and then right-right now I'm feeling that life is one big shit-sandwich. How are you?""

It makes me feel like I’m in control of something in my life. But it’s an illusion. Once done, I’m back at the beginning again. 

With other things in my life, I’ve found that facing up to things lessens their hold over me. I’m trying that now with depression. This doesn’t mean putting on a brave face. It means looking the darkness in the face and saying hello, like when you see that acquaintance that you kind of know but don’t. Instead of walking past hoping they don’t see you, you go up and say, “Hello. We meet again.” I’m hoping the more I face it, the more callused up I’ll become to it. It doesn’t mean it goes away.

I know these are just BS words, but I’ve been trying to make them a mantra to not avoid things but face them and be Ok with that. The words are “Be brave and fearless.” I keep saying them, and maybe if I say them enough I’ll believe them someday."

depression,f6om7x6,t3_dsc1c3,1573023469.0,"I've thought about this a lot over the last few days. It's like I'm fighting this black, tentaclly monster while splashing around in the ocean. Every so often, I'll get the upper hand. I'll grab that tentacled fucker and shove them under the water to drown them. But the monster can't drown. They love the cold waters, and it's taking everything I have to keep it down there.

People will pass by and ask if I'm OK. I'll say yes, because I'm too embarrassed to admit that the monster exists, and while it's below the water, it's touching me in all the bad places.

Eventually, I tire, and it's the monster's turn. It grabs me and starts dunking my head under the water. But I can drown, so it toys with me. It pulls my head up each time just before it's too late, so I can catch my breath. It whispers in my ear something similar to what Joker said in Suicide Squad, ""Don't worry buddy. I ain't going to kill ya'. I'm just going to hurt you real bad."" It dunks me and it dunks me. I'm too tired to fight it, and I start thinking instead of holding my breath, maybe I'll show that fucken monster. I'll drown myself just to spite him. 

But eventually, I'll find some strength to break free. Then we'll be slugging it out again on even ground. That's my normal. And then, then the cycle continues. Over-and-over."

In high school there was a girl I knew from my part-time job. She had flirted with me, and during the end of the year, when kids were still in school but were doing nothing but running around getting annuals signed, I some how ended up wandering the halls with her by my side. All I had to do was say something. Make a move. Instead, when I realized what could be happening, I panicked, and ran like a piece of shit. Said I had something to do. Pined for her hard, but by the time I'd gotten around to telling her how I felt, it was several bfs later, and well, she wasn't interested.

Wasn't really for her, but for what she represented.

I had this idea of what it would be like to be with her and all that stuff. Those thoughts keep popping up still, but I've been shoving them back down, because I know I'm going to create something that's just going to break my heart."

If our lives were graphs, my trajectory would be very similar to what you've shared, except I'm a bunch of years further down. I've always kept those around me at arm's length. 

It took me a long time to even consider there was something I needed help with. I'd constantly tell myself I was fine. I'd get through. Things would change once this stage of my life moved into the next. Something would happen eventually. Eventually turned into now, and nothing has changed, yet. I'm taking the first steps towards getting help.

I told a friend a few days ago, that I probably have depression, and it felt good. To not hold it in. To not pretend that everything was all right. To just not put distance between. It helped. And tomorrow, I'm going to tell my doctor, and hopefully, that'll help even more.

Consider telling someone in your life. Consider reaching out for help. 

I've only been hanging around this part of reddit a few days, but hearing the voices here has made me see, I am anything but alone in what I'm going through. And though it may not fit the norm--what ever hell that is--it's a normal thing that many people are going through. I'm going to keep telling myself that until I truly believe it.
