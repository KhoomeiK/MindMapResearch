PresidentialRaceMemes,fe0bbhu,t1_fdr993n,1578808556.0,"1) The reason why you should care about automation replacing ""lower skilled jobs"" is because the most commonly held jobs in America (ie: retail) will be replaced. That's a lot of people who are out of a job, with no liveable wage and therefore cannot contribute to the economy in a meaningful way. This doesn't even consider the fact that these people will be uninsured and underresourced for retirement, which again, yields a greater financial burden on the economy in the form of bankruptcy, unpaid hospital bills, defaulted loans, and welfare. Even by Yang's own logic, the idea is to prevent that from happening with UBI. The problem with his his ""freedom dividend"" is that it doesn't even begin to recoup those concequences. His dividend annualized is less than what someone makes at $7/hour. Yang also doesn't support a minimum wage (or M4A or student debt relief and a plethora of other progressive ideas). Also, opting into his dividend means you forgo other safety nets (ie: food stamps). One reason why this is relevant is because debt collectors will count that 1k/month as income - something they wouldn't otherwise be able to do with WIC, housing subsidies, etc. That leaves the unemployed with even less. But you should also care because these are human beings who will be out of a job. Even by conservative standards, we're talking about people who are actually willing to work here. Not jackoffs who want to collect a check for sitting on their ass. It's not too much to ask that peope who are actually willing to work have the means to cover the basics (which is why I believe Bernie has more crossover appeal).

2) You are rating jobs by what is less likely to be automated, but virtually any job has the potential to become obsolete at some point. Not because of ""algorithms"" but rather lateral advancements in technology. Literally every job is subject to that kind of automation. The newspaper business wasn't killed because of neural networks, it was killed because of the internet. TV was the first massive hit to the radio business. Taxi cabs and Shuttle Bus are dying off because of Lyft and Uber.  Blockbuster was eliminated by Netflix. Those are entire companies and industries being disrupted with technology that was unthinkable at the time. So to value a job based on what is ""less automatable"" is counter productive and frankly naive. It doesn't take AI to displace you, it just takes 1 clever invention to make you less valuable (and eventually obsolete). Even those cozy ""high skill"" jobs (which I happen to have) aren't entirely safe. Since Yang doesn't support a minimum wage, you'll be stuck with whatever you can manage + 12k/year and no benefits or safety nets."

However, if your role is more of a data science position, knowing matplotlib, or at least basic / native plotting techniques in Python and/or R goes a long way. Not so much for presenting to others regularly, but for exploratory purposes. Before doing any sort of modeling, you'll likely need to explore the data in various ways, and visualization is often a large part of that. While you could do that in Tableau or something, it makes sense to do it in code while your running your analysis. Visualizing your modeling results are also likely easier to just do alongside your code.

Also, knowing Python and packages like matplotlib put you far ahead of those who don't know it. It's almost a standard skill set in terms of what hiring managers seek. At least this has been my experience (roughly 7 years in data science)"

changemyview,f00dtgx,t3_d2qbvt,1568300587.0,"I have a great example. In the 50s and 60s when record labels had white artists record black artists music to market it to a white audience, without paying the black artists royalties, or without even allowing the black artists to perform the same song to a white crowd, or get radio play. They weren't given credit for the songs at all. And in some cases those songs didn't become hits until a white artist covered it. Elvis for instance (and I say this as a minority who likes Elvis's music), made his entire career on copying what they called ""Negro music"" at the time. That's what they called it when they were being nice...Other artists that I love like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin are also guilty of this (the latter of which who literally took a song from a black artist word for word, and was given no credit). But in general, people welcome true appreciation of ones culture, which is different from cultural appropriation. For instance black people (in general), love Eminem lol. I think this is because he respects the culture, pays hommage to the culture, gives credit when / where it's due, doesn't throw around the N word, and he isn't ""gesturing for likes"". Dude's origin story is very ""hip hop"". Even though someone like Lil Dicky (another white rapper) doesn't seem to have a ""hip hop credit"" bone in his body, he's super talented and credits black artists as his inspiration. (He's also hilarious). This is why most black people don't have a problem with him. Although some people may feel the marketing machine behind him has traces of cultural appropriation. Iggy Azealia is a great example of a rapper generally not supported by black people. She doesn't ""get the culture"" and seemingly doesn't care to. She has said racist and insensitive things about all sorts of minorities (going as far as saying she's a runaway slave master) and doesn't write her own music. Despite being from Australia and sounding like it when she talks, her rapper voice sounds like an imitation of a down south, black woman. She came off as inauthentic and disrespectful to minorities and the culture (and seemingly didn't care). Black people generally accept Nujabes (japanese hip hop artist), but are lukewarm about Jay Park (a Korean-American rapper).

One big problem with ACTUAL cultural appropriation is that it erases other cultures contribution to society, a d therefore their value. This is how you have an actual US politician on live TV saying that non white races have made no contribution to the West, or to the world (this ACTUALLY happened, and there are actual people who literally have this mindset). Being racist (or at minimum racially bias) is somewhat easy when you're under the impression that your race is the only race to ever come up with anything valuable, or that your version of everything is better. This is why some people get pissed at seemingly dumb stuff even like dreads (where black people are considered dirty a d can be fired for having them despite white women being considered edgy with them), or making a non white character white in films (which, depending on the role, can make it seem as though white people are the only worthy protagonists or heroes of a story or love interest.). I get it, without context it sounds stupid (some modern claims of appropriation are), but the impact that ACTUAL appropriation had on a people can be staggering financially, socially, and mentally. Growing up as a minority in the US, your self worth is wrapped up in your representation. A d when your representation is mostly negative because they stripped it of it's positive likeness and contributions and left all the negative stuff there, meanwhile giving all the ""good stuff"" to white people, including things they didn't found/invent themselves, it has real mental consequences to your self esteem. Additionally, it can make someone who's white for instance feel as though they're the center of the universe and everyone else is trash, which fuels racism. It's a marketing ploy. Since most people in the US is white, it's in a company's benefit to market favorably to white people and tend to their sentiments and self esteem. But since the racial makeup of America is gradually shifting, we see more diversity in media than 20 years ago. Only to some people (who are far too used to being catered to), it's ""PC Culture"". But somehow, 100s of years of white washing isn't. That's because in their minds, POC don't deserve those roles. They don't ""fit the role"", or didnt actually ""invent those things"" or wouldn't actually ""act like that"". A white person would, because only a white person (in their mind) could be a hero, be a geek, be attractive, be smart, be *insert positive attribute here*. This is how we end up with sayings like ""acting white"", where speaking proper English and being smart are automatically attributed to whiteness, or even ""white trash"", where whites have the liberty of dismissing whites with ""negative attributes"" as ""different from us, and therefore not a fair representation of our race as a whole"". Blacks for instance don't get a ""black trash"". If someone black is being ""ghetto"" for instance, that would just be acting ""black"", but if that same person goes to a rock concert they're ""acting white"". Which considering the beginning of this comment, is ironic, amd sort of further proves my point of why cultural appropriation is such a demeaning experience for minorities in the US."

What annoyed me though was the entitlement. ""Not everyone has Hulu!"" they complained. They felt betrayed by The Orville for simply adapting to the modern TV landscape (despite it giving the show runners more programming and artistic freedom). Well, not everyone has cable either these days, and also entertainment is a luxury, not a utility.

Using 2 languages however for the purposes you mentioned is unnecessary (and can be really daunting for your team, who apparently don't have any programming skills). Since you are new to R yourself, I would again recommend the language with which you are most comfortable, which seems to be Python.

- Know and accept that there is no end to the learning tunnel. Therefore, don't look at it like a race to ""learn everything"", but a journey to gradually add more tricks to your toolbox.

- Switch up your routine. Don't study the same thing for too long. Do come back to it, but give it a rest every now and then. This ensures you are still learning without feeling burned out on one subject. 

- Take legitimate breaks. I mean force yourself to stop studying. Indulge in a hobby you enjoy. Binge a TV show or hang out with friends. Go to the gym. Give your brain time to recuperate.

- Take good notes. No one remembers everything, but notes certaintly help.

- Be organized about your learning. Make a curriculum, preferably with dates. Try to stick to it.

- Once you learn something, apply it. Once you get stuck, get yourself unstuck. Do not keep building on a weak foundation.

- Accept that learning some concepts take time.

- If you believe your models aren't performing well, get feedback from online, white papers or trusted colleagues."

I work in tech as well (data science), and while my job itself isn't super demanding, the knowledge I'm required to posses is very daunting and demanding. However, I don't mind it because I love what I do. In many ways, it's a badge of honor for people like your boyfriend to survive an all nighter or completed this crazy demanding project. It might seem like he's miserable in the midst of it all, but when it's over, he may feel like it was all totally worth it, because that's his passion. It's totally psycho, I know, but he might just be wired that way. And when you're wired to be a ""production machine"" and your partner has a way ""easier"" job, sometimes the major difference makes it seem like the other person is ""lazy"", when it's not true, they're just not used to working as ""hard"". And I use all those air quotes because those terms are really relative. Again, I have  been guilty of thinking of my bf in the same light. For instance when it came time for us to apply to jobs, he'd be tired and stressed out applying to 3 jobs a day. I average 15. Even knocking out a million chores a day while completing 3 machine learning projects over the weekend is the way I'm wired. Filing taxes for my boyfriend is like a major event.

So as someone who's been on the other side of the fence it sounds like A) He's either being a dick or B) his workload / lifestyle is so far from normal that everyone with a normal workload appears lazy. Who knows, maybe it's both. Haven't figured it out yet myself."
relationships,etn1fj1,t3_ccbfe0,1562974075.0,"It sounds like your bf is still in grad school, correct? It's not totally unusual to not work during graduate school which is usually busy with class, studying, research / assistantships, work-study, internships (which should really be his primary focus if he wants to be competitive in the job market post graduation, not a minimum wage job at McDonalds for example), etc. It's also not unusual to use financial aid or wage earned from internships or work-study for living expenses (it's got to get paid for somehow). The only alternative is using it on on-campus housing, which is oftentimes even pricier than local apartments. 

&#x200B;

However, it *is* unusual to have all that on your plate, and then move in with a significant other into a lofty apartment that's hardly affordable. As someone who has been through graduate school, using savings/ financial aid / internship money / side jobs / work-study and family contributions are the typical way graduate students pay for living expenses. Living in an expensive apartment contributes to more debt.  


Is your boyfriend sitting around doing nothing or is he doing internships? Why temp work exactly? It's possible he's using temp work to get ""applicable experience"", but typically that's what internships are for. In terms of debt, he's not wrong. The question is, are you okay with his debt and how he treats it? I can also see where you're coming from, but presuming he's trying to go for a ""professional"" / office or STEM career, it makes since to want applicable work experience (again, unless he's sitting around doing nothing). To me, it seems like the biggest sin here isn't him being picky, but living in an apartment neither of you can reasonably afford, or at the very least, moving in before finances were discussed.

jobs,esnlea0,t3_c8aucv,1562137310.0,"In a similar situation except I know it's the technical parts I keep failing on. I interview very well and look great on paper but need to improve my coding interviews which I'm not the best at doing on the spot.

My advice to you is to network. If you're not applying to jobs (aim to apply to at least 3 a day if they're out there and interesting to you), you should be networking. Reach out to your alumni, go to meetups relevant to your profession, join professional groups (linkedin, slack, etc), attend conferences/ workshops. Try to add HR people too. Have informational interviews.

And most of all (and this is the hardest part) be patient. And don't burn any bridges. This part of life sucks but it's temporary."

BlackPeopleTwitter,esdy2yx,t1_es6r62l,1561872874.0,"One things that gets me is in coastal cities like NY, LA or SF, the liberal whites will be the first to tell you they love living there bc of the diversity, but when you ask for elaboration, you find out that just means the diversity in food options. Other than that, they generally don't spend a single second around minorities unless it's in a work environment, or just passing by (ie: gas station, grocery store). So I never understood the whole ""I love diversity"" response from them."
BlackPeopleTwitter,esdxcx5,t1_es9ugtu,1561872082.0,"Exactly. Not to mention taxes weren't included. If you live in California (like me), a cool 5th of your check will be gone with that wage."
BlackPeopleTwitter,esdwl36,t1_esdgugn,1561871261.0,"My bf is a white passing Latino with straight hair and he said him and all his siblings and cousins got lice growing up. No one in my family has ever had it. But truth be told, personal experiences are irrelevant. I'm assuming the original response was a joke given the actual numbers behind lice as it relates to race. There is a scientific reason as to why black people ON AVERAGE don't experience lice like other races, but race is really a confounding variable for hair texture. And most black people don't have the the environment lice seek in hair. If you look at research, black people get lice significantly less than other races. Of course hygiene is likely another important factor, among others, which is why it still happens. But I don't understand what's so wrong with pointing this out. We can acknowledge black people have a higher chance of, say high blood pressure, but suddenly acknowledging we dont get lice as often is out of the question? It's not that serious.

And fyi, it's not because black hair is ""rough"", it's because it's very curly and lice tend to gravitate towards hair follicles they can grasp and climb on to lay their eggs."
BlackPeopleTwitter,esdvpvc,t1_esc5ch4,1561870363.0,"Yeah. At this point I kind of wish her policies and history were circulating as much as her race. The longer we're focused on ""who's black and who's not"" the longer we're not talking about what shes already done to undisputed black ppl."
BlackPeopleTwitter,es0qigb,t1_erzw12u,1561481034.0,"The linear equation (y = mx + b) is pretty relevant to anything that has a linear relationship, which includes anything that has a direct correlation. For instance, there is a strong correlation between credit score and probability of defaulting on a loan. There's a strong correlation between caloric intake and weight gain. Oftentimes, there's a correlation between money spent on marketing your business and sales. Algebra in general is useful anytime to you're trying to determine an unknown value given various inputs. That's virtually anything in life that involves decision making, from figuring out how many cups of flour you should use in a baking recipe, to converting units, to figuring out how much your payments will be with different interest rates, to comparing prices for the same product with different quantities. Even most jobs require at least a sliver of analytic skill, which requires basic math skills. Basic algebra is probably one of the most useful things you've ever learned in school. The point is, she's likely used y = mx + b a million times over without even knowing it."
