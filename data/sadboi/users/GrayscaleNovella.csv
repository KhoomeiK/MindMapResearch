Just remember a nose job doesn’t change who you are. Your smile and frown and dimples and freckles and whatever other parts of you that are unique still look the same. It’s just a slight change to one small piece of you.

Maybe it wasn’t the best decision, but you were seventeen and your doctor or guardians should have realized maybe that wasn’t the right time in your life for such a big choice.

I’d consider finding a therapist who deals in body issues, or one just to help you process the anxiety your feeling.

I know it sounds kind of lame, but it really works when you do the work and find someone you trust.

In the first season or two you see how much AJ really loves Tony and is always looking for his attention. When Tony’s actually there it’s good, but then business always comes up and he leaves and you begin to see AJ shut down more and more every time.

Then he gets older and people start using him because of his dad’s “connections” and he’s just kind of floundering with no one giving him any real guidance. Carmella has permanently decided to have rose-tinted glasses as far as her family because that’s the choice she knows she made. And her influences of the men and families she’s been around and learned from.

She does love AJ and you can see her trying to reach out to him but she never ends up saying the right thing or anything more than on a superficial level and AJ just checks out again. Then he gets resentful.

There’s the nature versus nurture aspect of it, and I feel like he was failed on both fronts. The scene where he tried to kill himself had me crying because here we are watching someone who started out as a somewhat happy kid turned into a young adult so lost and emotionally alone not knowing anyone who isn’t like his own family to find help. I don’t think it was even about his ex, it was the final straw that just made him realize he has no idea how to handle his emotions and who he even is. 

My ex-boyfriend’s family was exactly the same dynamic, minus his dad being connected. We grew up in an area known for being basically the same as Tony’s neighborhood (and nearby). My ex needed therapy and had obvious depression and for the longest time his mom tried to get him to “exercise” it away. Luckily his father was intelligent and open to different ideas enough to get him a little help.

confession,fnhnkee,t3_g1piop,1586965629.0,"My younger sister was an avid user for a lot of her teenage years (triggered by some serious family trauma). 

At one point after relapsing she got pregnant while still in high school and had to get an abortion. I remember being furious with her because she had, had condoms under her bed that she was too high to remember to use. She also had a non-treatable STD she could’ve passed on to her boyfriend, a really nice guy who loved her to pieces.

My mom was sympathetic and helpful with her even though she was really distraught over the whole thing. I remember thinking no one was actually angry enough with her for torpedoing everyone’s lives and I wasn’t going to be so nice.

Before they left for the appointment I told her she was disgusting and almost ruined multiple people’s lives because of her stupidity. I told her, her baby was better off being dead then being raised by her. I was really cruel, but I was so angry at this stranger burning out in front of me and causing all of us pain. Our aunt who we were really close with too had just committed suicide and I felt like my sister wasn’t even grieving, didn’t even care. It felt like someone else had died.

I said some other awful things to her over the next few weeks, and didn’t speak to her at all when she left for rehab the second time (and the whole 6 months she was there). She was a kid and hurting but I didn’t want to see it.

That was eight years ago, and two days ago marks 8 years of sobriety for her. We (and my whole family) are extremely close now and her life is really great. I apologized for how I acted about the abortion. She forgave me but it’s something I will always regret. 
 
Family therapy helped re-open the wounds and let them begin to heal properly. The rest was just time and effort. We’re both engaged now and going to be maids of honor in each other’s weddings.

As someone engaged and also in an extremely expensive city, it’s just not feasible for only one partner to work. Even if you had a high paying job, it would most likely equate to you working extremely long hours and with the constant pressure of if you lose this job then what?

Benefits, retirement and bills will be entirely on you, and I’m sure rent is a fortune where you are if you end up not being able to afford a house.

Adding a child let alone multiple to the mix will be a huge hit to you both financially, and if you slip on paying bills it’ll be a backslide from there. Plus it’ll be almost impossible to build savings if you’re constantly just trying to keep your heads above water month to month. What if your child is born special needs? Or needs certain types of therapy? Or needs a carer? Is she prepared those might be real possibilities for a potential child?

Not even counting the fact that you’ll most likely build up resentment at the constant strain of supporting everyone.

It’s okay to want to switch your career, but she needs to remember a marriage is a partnership and that you have to think about your partner and their needs as well as your own.

I agree to what some posts say about possible marriage or financial counseling. Maybe hearing the facts laid out from a neutral third party could bring a little clarity to a touchy subject.

And the miners actually do well in the diamond industry, colored stone mining is the one that’s still fairly primitive and dangerous due to the inconsistency of the pockets. Diamond mines are huge operations that can supply steady jobs for years and years. 

That said, buy what makes you happy. Morganite, Moissanite, CZ whatever. I personally went with an Emerald. Don’t shame people for what makes them happy, whether it’s expensive, cheap, common or not."

Like, dude, you’re literally posting in subreddits asking for financial help and how worried you are about paying rent and you’re planning on having MORE children when you already have a kid? Why?

When I was a kid my best friend who was a girl had to share a room with her two older brothers until she was well into her teens because they could only afford a two bedroom apartment. The family didn’t have a car for several years because they couldn’t afford it, but also had several pets. The poor dog had fleas multiple times and swollen eyes from severe allergies because they couldn’t afford treatment.

Why would you want that for a child? Because of your need to procreate? It’s not fair to them and it’s selfish."

But you love who you love, and if he loves you, learn to rock holding that mans hand and fuck everyone who looks. Because after that they’ll probably go back to worrying about their own shit and not give it a second thought.

I think everyone is way too quick to bash a woman (or man) about not liking their ring.

You know what? YOU’RE the one who has to wear it everyday for the foreseeable future, and despite the “I don’t care if it’s a ring pop” mindset a lot of people our age have, it is a symbol of commitment and you want to at least know your partner put thought and care into it.

I worked for a jewelry store for several years in a slightly lower-middle class town. Average cost for couples on a ring was about $2,500. But I also sold way above and below that.

Didn’t want a diamond? Cool, maybe a colored stone or moissanite and we’ll keep it in your budget and still be beautiful. Want to spend $10,000? Sure, your money, your choice.

70% of the time the partner would come in to at least show/give an idea to the other partner what they were interested in.

90% would have at the very least discussed marriage beforehand and had a partner show them some pictures.

What’s hurtful is it seems like he’s bragging about spending so little. And I’m sorry but $20 is half-assed. It doesn’t seem like he spoke with you or did any research at all into what will wear well or what you may like.

It’s okay to be upset, it’s your relationship and you are absolutely entitled to your feelings (which don’t seem entitled at all for the record).

Maybe talk to him about picking something together because you’re worried about breaking that one? You can always wear it on a necklace and pick something that you both like.

I’m sorry you’re hurt OP and hope you guys are able to talk it out."

trashy,f62149i,t3_dq7caj,1572651344.0,"The non-local commuter buses by me have an unwritten rule: you can keep your stuff on the seat next to you UNTIL the bus gets crowded. Then you either move your stuff voluntarily or if someone asks to sit there you say “sure” and move your things onto your lap. This works because it’s usually business people going/coming from work and it’s their everyday bus, and because everyone moves their stuff when/if asked (usually before this point).

Also, the bus only picks up on one side of our bridge and does exclusive drop-offs on the other so you always have room again at some point.

If it’s above an SI2 and near/on the table, chances are it shouldn’t affect you looking at it with the naked eye or the durability of the stone.

Whatever stone you pick, check the return policy and see if you can view it with a 10X loupe if you really want to look closely at it for yourself.

She walked in and he was immediately mesmerized by her cavernous cleavage. After a moment as his eyes finally (somewhat) adjusted, he noticed her legs that seemed to go on for miles. Perfect for wrapping around a mans hips or flashing hints of silky smooth thighs in dresses that were all somehow sexily too short. Her hair was tied back in a bun type thing which would’ve looked manly on anyone else, but impossible on anyone with tits like hers. Her ass was nonexistent, but he told himself it was nothing some gym time couldn’t fix. Chuckling at the thought he walked over and began to panic as he realized those lengthy legs made her several inches taller than his 6’1 (read 5’9) frame. The height of a man!

For the record my sister is marrying a woman and one of my aunts has been with her partner since before I was born.

jewelers,f1q6poa,t3_dair3w,1569694616.0,"I honestly don’t think they would re-cut the stone as the price for cutting it isn’t really worth just getting a new one if the chip is that deep. (If it’s shallow, it’s possible they can polish it out but you definitely will lose weight as they’d have to even everything out so all the facets still line up). If you want to switch settings though, now might definitely be a good time. You can check-in with your jeweler about getting a prong-set semi-mount and either switch your remaining little diamonds over to the the new setting, or once again, it might just be cheaper to buy the setting already put together (sometimes it can be more labor intensive for the jeweler to remove all those little stones and re-set them). As for the chip, moissanite are very durable and cut well, especially coming straight from C&C. There’s really not too much you can do to prevent chipping other than being careful and removing it when doing anything with your hands that can cause damage.  A bezel head will have much more metal around it and hide some of the fire from the stone which is why most diamonds have some sort of prong-setting for at least the center stone. You can always do six prongs, double-claw prongs or platinum for a head but all except platinum will be a cause for more metal around the center stone. You can also always fix that setting and set another stone in the center for just an everyday ring. Basically, good news is there’s a lot of different options and prices to play around with. None are bad, just up to you. :)"
