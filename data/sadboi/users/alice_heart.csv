AskReddit,fp43iym,t1_fp40l7m,1588290971.0,"I think your major problem is what you pointed out in your post and edit - you just didn’t see the whole movie. You’re missing a loooot of context and drawing a conclusion that can’t really be drawn if you see the entire thing. You’re still more than welcome not to like it, i know a lot of people that didn’t enjoy it like I did, but it’s definitely a satirical farce and I think because you were sick and left early much of that might have been missed. Maybe give it another shot! The filmmakers weren’t making a cruel joke about what Hitler did or treating people wrong, they were actually commenting on herd mentality and the goodness within many of us as we just try to get by. 

edit: I read through some more comments and wanted to come back and say if you left pretty early then you might not have seen that the Hitler we see is Jojo’s interpretation of someone he views as his hero. We’re seeing an imaginary friend of sorts that we the audience, and many adults in the film, know to be wrong. It adds to the comedy element but is also used to tell a story of what happens when young people begin to think for themselves and take responsibility for their actions and make an effort to change when they realize that they’re wrong."

“You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi. I can tell that it’s gonna be a long road.” 

It’s just such a simple line illustrating such a perfect, private, quiet moment between two people.

AskReddit,foh6z2c,t3_g79cmj,1587761223.0,"For me personally I find a lot of hope in the idea that we are alone in the universe, strangely enough. To me, it makes our existence mean something, even if it was just a fluke that got us here. It means life itself is important. If we are alone then life is a practically insurmountable hill and we climbed it and kept climbing. The great filter might actually be behind us. Maybe it is up to us to spread life throughout the cosmos, or not. If we are alone then we are truly responsible for the continuation of life, our planet and eventually maybe other planets. If we are alone, then all we ultimately have is each other. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I can get very cynical about that possibility. But sometimes I like to think that it’s a bond between all living things that can’t be broken. Life spreading in the universe might be up to us. Maybe we are just a blip in a dark, dead universe. Or maybe we’re just the first. 

I don’t know, it’s easy to get caught up in the day to day but hoping for a brighter future with a purpose for us all helps."

TaylorSwift,fmux1ig,t3_fwrejb,1586400799.0,"ok this dream was SUPER weird and happened during the 1989 era. 

I was in New York and went to dinner somewhere and was invited into the back out of nowhere by Taylor Swift. I sat down and had dinner with her and she asked if I needed a ride home in her jet. Guess I did cause I said yes. Well we get on the jet and it’s hijacked and we are knocked out and tied up. We wake up, now suddenly in the back of some cargo plane, and taylor and i find something sharp and cut the ties around our wrists and we JUMP THEN FALL (hah) OUT OF THE PLANE AND INTO THE SOUTH AMERICAN RAIN FOREST. We crash through trees but land safely on the ground. We start hacking our way through the forest with her heels as machetes, and we know we’re being followed. We eventually make our way to a village under the cover of darkness and hide in a factory type building. But it’s here that we realize the people who kidnapped us are hiding. They own the factory and we overhear them talking about their plans to destroy a dam nearby. Because this is a dream, we understand that these guys are holding the village hostage for their resources and will destroy the village by tomorrow. Taylor suddenly stands. She has a gun in one hand, her stiletto in the other. She tells me to “Run. Get everyone out.” She runs at the bad guys, firing a gun into the air. I take off and jump out of a window. Taylor is fighting inside, gun shots are going off, everything is chaos. I crawl to the closest house. I knock and tell them we need to get out, the dam is about to blow. The villagers warn me that the bad guys have tigers in their factory. I round up the citizens but realize - I cant leave taylor swift. We all run back to the factory and in a moment of blind faith I release the tigers from their cage. My thought process? Taylor Swift loves cats. And apparently cats love Taylor Swift because they run right past her into the group of men she is fighting and they start attacking the bad guys. I also think more animals were involved in this part as well but it gets hazy. Next thing I know, Taylor and I are leading these villagers out of danger towards an airline hanger with a band of tigers as our protection. We get to the hanger, and Tree is waiting for us. She tells us good job. Taylor says we should get tea sometime. I say yes, that seems like fun.

It sounds backwards but it’s a fact that contracts go out and production companies can then demand insane things with little to no time for the artists and no change in compensation, which is why Cats was finished 6am the day of, I am sure.  It’s a real shame honestly because the good work we see can be attained with fair payment and more time, but it’s all about the bottom line, money, and release dates.

It’s not that few days of sick you feel after getting the shot. It’s not just a bad cold or a respiratory virus that is just named vaguely ‘the flu’. It’s not “oh i have the flu listen to this cough” or “creepy crud is going around and i got it! damn the flu!”, influenza is insane. I’ve had it twice, once with the H1N1 scare a few years back (which was taking down healthy young people as well as the usual elderly and very young so swine flu was a very scary time) and then again a couple years later. The first time I was so sick with swine flu that I don’t even remember the two weeks I was home from school and when I went back to school I passed out and doctors said I had contracted pneumonia so it was another two weeks of vague recollections and drowning in fluid. the second time however I was on a road trip with my family to San Francisco. We start the drive, I’m completely fine. 6 hours later I’ve got a fever of 103.5 and it’s rising, we’re pulling into San Fran and i’m covered in a blanket because every light is like a pickaxe to my brain through my eyeballs and I’m simultaneously sweating like a pig and freezing cold. I didn’t know if I was going to throw up or actually eject my heart from my mouth, i could NOT move it was extremely painful and exhausting. Literally five steps to the toilet in the hotel felt like an eternity and i had to sit for 30 minutes before I had energy to crawl back to the bed. I honestly thought I would die. Truly. I called my mom and said goodbye which was a little dramatic looking back. But I’ve never been so sick that I was sure I wouldn’t make it until I had influenza. It’s extremely terrifying. And if it can take down a relatively healthy 20 something with a working immune system like that, imagine what it can do to children or the elderly or people who cannot get vaccinated and rely on herd immunity. Get your freaking flu shots people. You and everyone you know will thank us for insisting."

Would you rather I spell out my entire life for you right here so you can make clear judgements or is it easier to just make assumptions and then unnecessary comments? 

Oh, and yeah. My pets are my kids. They don’t talk back and form shitty opinions like some people."

It’s so cute though! you look great! i wish I had gotten that one but I got the Death By A Thousand Cuts tee and i’m very excited about that"
TaylorSwift,f9juhhu,t3_e5er81,1575386074.0,"It’s ok bby we welcome you back. No rep stans, new or old, shall be excluded here. come. join the family."
TaylorSwift,f9juedf,t1_f9jpxmg,1575386015.0,"Can confirm, she also had multiple pictures in the Red and Speak Now eras, though social media easter eggs were less of a thing back then. but she had 3 for 1989 if I remember correctly."
Blep,f9jsrex,t1_f9j2x7z,1575384838.0,Our Thanksgiving toast is always - “to the pets we have loved and lost”. May they live on in our hearts forever and may we pass their love on to everyone in our lives

TaylorSwift,f97n81h,t1_f96s4gn,1575167832.0,Sounds like the AWESOME! sweatshirt but i loooove it because it’s so soft. And i’ve washed it a couple times and it’s still just as soft. I was actually really happy with it. So excited to get mine! You look fantastic!
TaylorSwift,f95l97b,t3_e3oiei,1575130231.0,"Bon Iver, Hozier, Death Cab (and all the lead singers side projects) and Ben Howard are some of my FAVORITE lyricists. They’re songs feel like i’m reading an impeccably edited novel from O. Henry, they just tell a story so well and so beautifully"
TaylorSwift,f91w3kv,t3_e34hye,1575003157.0,"Honestly I loved the music video. I just felt like she had so many LOOKS (hello rainbow dress) and it was just so fun and simple in a lot of ways. After all the crap she went through I kinda just loved seeing her jet set across locations, hanging with friends or alone, but still being an absolute bad ass with a big reputation. I just always liked the aesthetic of it."
TaylorSwift,f8uv29r,t1_f8u34r3,1574845750.0,That second one is my favorite picture of her. I LOVE the rep photo shoots
TaylorSwift,f8sz1s4,t3_e1smm0,1574792230.0,State of Grace was MADE to drive to with your windows down on a sunny interstate. I also jam hard to Getaway Car when I’ve got long trips.
TaylorSwift,f8sy1lz,t3_e1t0t8,1574791609.0,"I woulda loved if the piano was a bit from the Long Live / New Year’s day remix from Rep tour (then we hit Speak Now AND rep, and both of those songs symbolize the light of moving on, which Lover is all about) and then gone into Lover BUT i also realize she has time constraints. I just love that medley so much I was hoping it would make an appearance to check off a song from every album. BUT ILL BE ALRIGHT ITS JUST A THOUSAND CUTS"
TaylorSwift,f8sxlvc,t1_f8srxdf,1574791339.0,"they absolutely can, and that was the first thing I thought when I saw her as well. I also don’t wanna speculate but I think what got me was how when she walked and performed it looked stiff but almost like it must be hurting, which it probably was. lupus flare ups can be so painful so I’ve been worried she was fighting that the whole night. Lupus flare up or not, I am very proud of her for managing to perform anyway after a long time away, that’s gotta be harder than the GP can hope to understand, and i hope she didn’t feel like she HAD to. I hope it was she WANTED to and it was a personal victory. Autoimmune diseases are no joke and neither are flare ups."
