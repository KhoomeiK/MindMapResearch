Advice,fqhawa7,t3_giru8n,1589372846.0,"Choose your friends wisely. If you can't be real around them - if you have to behave or be different than who you are to be friends with them, regardless of how much you may like them, they are not real friends. Be loyal to your friends. Most people will have your back if you have theirs. If someone consistently won't be honest with you, they're most likely not worth being friends with.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes. That's a good way to learn.

ETA: If you have a job now, or the next job you get, save what you can. You don't have to be super stingy, but if you can, save half of what you make. Right now, your expenses are most likely pretty low, so you have a chance to save some money. Take advantage of that. You don't have to be super stingy. A while back, I had a job where I made $50 a week babysitting for 8.5 hours each Saturday. I saved $25 each week, and when I quit that job after 2 years, I had $2,500 saved. That's a bit extreme, but learn how to save and budget. Your future self will thank you.

It's your and Red's house/apartment, the two of you live there and pay the expenses to live there. I'm assuming that your friends do not financially contribute, so they have absolutely no say in what happens in your house. At a party, they are guests, nothing more. They are not entitled access to a room in your house that has the sole purpose of being a comfort/safe room when Red is stressed or overwhelmed.

I'm autistic, and it sounds like Red and I have quite a few similarities. I **DESPISE** being in pictures and would be quite upset if somebody put up a picture with me in it on social media. I wouldn't put up a picture of somebody else on any of my social media without asking. It's a matter of respect. I don't know if Red is like this, but here's how I am with my room and van - it's my place and I'm very uncomfortable with people coming and going because it's my place. I have a keyed entry lock on my room and only I have the keys. I always keep my van locked and *nobody* gets in my van unless I trust them, like them, and am comfortable with them. My van and room are my spaces, where I'm comfortable and can relax and I'm a bit territorial over them because it is essential to me to have a place I can escape from everybody when I get overwhelmed.

I don't know how well Red can stand up for himself or verbalize how he's feeling (this is something I can have trouble with), but step in, with his permission, to explain if you need to. You and Red have an understanding that the Forbidden Room is for him. It is not for other people. Nobody is entitled to that room unless they live in your house and are paying rent/utilities.

Good for you and Red for having a room that he can feel safe and comfortable in.

Honestly, it sounds like some of your friends have an unreasonable sense of entitlement. They need to respect that the Forbidden Room is for Red, not for them, and Red is the one who should grant access, if he chooses on his own terms."
unpopularopinion,fmqzba9,t3_fws1e5,1586310327.0,"I live in a town with a Church of Christ private university. It may not be an elite university, but you're going to be paying around $100K for a 4 year undergrad degree. Many attend the university and get a pretty hefty student loan debt.

I've seen people who are massively pressured into attending this university. I even have a friend who, while attending this university, was viewed upon kindly by their family. Due to unforeseen circumstances, they had to leave halfway through their last semester, and went into the workforce to pay off what they could of their debt (family did not help) and when they finally were able to go back to this university and finish their degree, their family turned around and looked favorably upon this person.

One thing I've seen with many friends who attend this university is that their parents will either partially or fully carry the financial load of their child's college education only off they attend this particular university. If they don't attend this university, then they're 100% responsible for any student loan debt. This is extremely common. I have several friends who felt pressured into attending this university and getting a degree that, 3 years after graduation, they have yet to use. That's their choice and their decision. I even went to this university for 2 semesters and my parents willingly paid for it. I'm in the same boat as all of these people *""either go to XXXX University and we'll pay for tuition, in part or in full, or you are completely on your own for paying tuition at another college or university.""*

There can be a huge amount of familial pressure to go to a certain university that plays into a person's choice in post high school education."

The two in the photo were made from printer paper. I folded the paper in half and ripped it apart so that the pieces would be 8.5""x5.5"". I then folded them again so that they would be 4.25""x5.5"". Once I got enough to make a journal, I set them all folded edges together and marked every half inch all the way down, then made a small cut on the marks. I put 5 sheets together to make each section, then used an awl to poke a hole through each section.

Once I had the sections together, I got a piece of cardstock, folded then ripped it in half the same way, marked half inch increments down the spine, and put holes at each mark. I put one on either side of the printer paper and put yarn in the fold of both pieces of card stock, and sewed up the spine. Once I was done, I glued the cardstock together to deal up the yarn, then glued a piece of cardstock over the spine to cover the thread.

What caused me to quit was that the parents and grandmother would not back me up on anything. All 3 of them work in the salon. Well, there's a Goodwill right next door. I would take some of the kids over to play and I would keep an eye on them. I could only handle the 2 girls and one of the boys at a time. (The girls were 4 and 7, the boys were 2 and 5). The reason I could only handle 1 boy at a time was because the 5yo boy has Downs, and wouldn't listen and loved to run, and it was essentially like babysitting a 2yo and a 2.5yo. I tried as hard as I could to get the boys to listen to me, bit there's only so much I can do as a babysitter. I could not take both boys to Goodwill without risking the safety of all 4 children. I explained this to the dad, and the parents were on my side. However, the grandmother was not and she was *very* insistent on me taking all 4 children.

I would have to get the children down for a nap. I had a pretty good system going. Get the boys to sleep, then the girls. Well, the 4yo girl started trying to get loud and jump on the bed after I got the boys to sleep. The boys absolutely had to have a nap, no questions about it, and if they woke up, I could not get them back to sleep. She knew exactly what she was doing. She would jump on the bed, be loud, and was very defiant.

My solution was to talk to the 4yo and tell her that she had 2 choices: be a big girl and be quiet and not wake up their brothers, or she could be loud and dance around. She could only be in the room if she was quiet. She would tell me she'd be quiet, but she never was, so I would put her outside of the room. If she was going to be loud and disruptive, she could do it where she wouldn't wake up her brothers, and where her parents could properly discipline her if they chose to. They chose not to, and would send her back into the room. I already had a separate job, so I told the parents I had another job and couldn't work on Saturdays anymore. That was partially a lie - I could babysit on Saturdays, but I was tired of the parents and grandmother taking advantage of me."

Advice,fkrelhp,t1_fkrds0f,1584467319.0,"If I thought that calling CPS would actually do good for her and get her and her sister out of the house instead of leaving them in there, I would have called a long time ago. But, as it stands, I really do not think that calling CPS would do much more than cause mom to gear up the crazy. If the parents/grandparents find out it was me that called CPS, that means I'm out of the picture. If I'm out of the picture, then the girls are stuck wit a mom who will steal and a dad who won't stand up for them and grandparents who just try to work through stuff. No shame on the grandparents.

The girls are subject to some degree of mental/emotional neglect and twisted mind games from mom, but they are fed and clothed and sent to school and medically taken care of. They are not beat on, they are not starved, they are victims of mom's mind games. I'm really not sure if CPS would do anything about that."

unpopularopinion,fk17aza,t3_ffoas5,1583773860.0,"My paternal grandfather lost all my respect beyond he's a person that deserves a base level of respect.

My dad's side of the family is Church of Christ. My mom's side of the family is conservative Mennonite. My mom walked away from the Mennonite church at 21. By 25, she was already in the CoC, where she met my dad. They got married. 29 years later, my dad's sister and their father have yet to respect my mom or accept her. My mom's side of the family has accepted my dad as an in-law, yet Aunt Sandy and my grandma haven't.

Once, when Sandy and my grandpa were at the house, I was sitting in the living room and my mom was in the kitchen right next to us. You can hear everything that happens in the living room when you're in the kitchen. Well, my grandpa, aunt and I were sitting in silence when, completely unprovoked, my grandpa told me ""The only reason your dad married your mom was because he was running out of time to get married."" Those were his exact words, when he knew my mom was sin the next room. This is also the same man who forced his other son (my uncle) to marry the woman he knocked up, and my uncle being in my cousins' lives has really fucked them up.

My mom was 26 and my dad was 29 when they got married. That's not running out of time.

I don't know my grandpa well enough to have anything more than base level 'he's a human' respect for him. I've spent a grand total of an hour around him in the past 10 years. No interest in spending a second more around him."

raisedbynarcissists,fjzh1sv,t3_fet5l9,1583719541.0,"This really hits home for me. I have a cousin who lives about half an hour away from me. He and his wife have 2 girls - 15 and 8. After taxes, my cousin barely makes any more than what his wife makes. They're able to make ends meet and live decently comfortable, but not much more. Anyhow, my cousin is spineless. It's just a bad situation for the girls, and moreso for the 15yo. I got her a lock box that only her and I have the key to, and now she has a place to put her money so her mom can't steal it.

Anyhow, my cousin's wife is HORRIBLE with money. My cousin pays for the school tuition for both girls, he pays all the bills, he pays for food, he pays for car insurance for both himself and his wife. The only 'family expense' my cousin's wife pays for is *maybe* $50 of groceries a month. She pays for her car payment, gas, and hundreds of dollars a month on spray tans and her hair and occasional fun stuff for the 8yo. It's ridiculous."

On Sunday, they have all doors unlocked until a certain time, after which they lock certain doors to funnel incoming traffic through certain doors. On Wednesdays, I know they keep certain doors locked in the middle of class, but it bears the end of class time, all doors are unlocked. So, you can always get in, you just may have to go to the other side of the building. During this meeting, all doors are locked."

Like I said, I have found cigarette butts in the bathrooms, along with dip turds and dip pouches on the mats in the urinals, and this is such a common occurrence and at the right time to be from members.

So it's not just the people who come to the meal and smoke, it's people who attend the church that use tobacco products.

Thank God He has grace and mercy for everyone who isn't the utmost reverent and respectful, because if He wasn't a graceful and merciful being, we would all be doomed to the pits of hell. That doesn't let people off the hook for not being respectful. Of course, everyone should try, but humanity is imperfect."
