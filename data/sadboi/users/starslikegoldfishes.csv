and all this just in time for my inevitable breakdown in exhaustion and self isolation and therefore destruction of all my responsibilities and friendships i build throught the past two months. 

i can stay in, reload, drink wine, paint and watch anime all day and no one bats an eye . im thriving right now!"

BPD,fjragvg,t1_fjpratz,1583583266.0,"narcissists think of people as an extension of themselves and we are used to seeing ourselves as an extension of an fp, plus we love similarly. 

we both have the tendency to love bomb,  which is when you go out of your way to make someone feel like the most perfect person alive, ever, and to switch on people. we just have different reasons to do so. 

i realised after a relationship with someone who was narcissistic that the extreme love and then withdrawal pattern made me feel addicted and gave me a rush and a longing sensation to be accepted again, (which I thought was really intense love, but its not)

 after some research it turned out that that is just the way that kind if relationship impacts our brain chemistry (more than with neurotipical people) we are used to feeling that way, a relationship where someone is stable and really loves us may feel unfulfilling or not like real love or boring, so with genuinely good people we tend to project past hurt onto them or create chaos because that is what we know.

Heavymind,fhlcafx,t3_f3rkqe,1581698737.0,"my idea while painting this was that it was about a girl who gives everything to someone she loves to the point of losing her entire identity (for this reason no nipples/face/pubic hair) she lives as a projection of what the one she loves wants her to be just for the sake of being loved and being able to give them her all.

the funny thing is that everyone who comes in my room and sees this painting has an entirely different feeling/ idea of what it means to them so id be interested in hearing yours!"

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fedu10o,t3_eoiz7t,1579019877.0,"ooh im always in for hating on freud (:

 he also believed lesbianism was a gateway to mental ilness but being gay was somehow ok because ""only men have moral sense"" and having a gay daughter was the dads fault. its insane. 

and he thought women always need a man to guide them. and thats why lesbians are loose cannons to him. 

he had a lesbian daughter (anna) which he tried and failed to ""cure"" through psychoanalisis. 

and he thought all children want to fuck their parents in some stage of their development. so yeah please go on hating this guy reasons enough to!"
BPD,fe4yv06,t3_enrtwo,1578864114.0,"yeah i had this in high school, which led me to forcing myself to only think the most socially acceptable least offensive thoughts i could, all the time. which was really exhausting."
BPD,fc0q6o6,t3_efhuix,1577296976.0,"i tried to make this question into a philosophical discussion in a bar once to get an answer as to how this works for neurotypical people, and turns out everyone had a different opinion on what their identity was, (memories/opinions/values/experiences/the choices you make and why etc) 

 but what made them sure about their identity was a sense of continuity. 

so its less of a knowing who you are but more of a belief/feeling of security that who you were last week is the same person you are today even if opinions or experiences or emotions change all the time. 

so ive been trying to identify less with thoughts or emotions and more with the part of me that experiences them, it seems to be working alright so far. 

and to remind myself that even if im dissociating and dont feel like a person, there is still a ""me"" that experiences this feeling and that its gonna pass, its just a feeling it isnt the truth.

maybe that could help you too?"
