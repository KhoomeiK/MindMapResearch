I used it last to distribute backend processing across multiple servers.  Typically you'd get a cluster, keep track of the host count.  Run the hash across your unique key and only process the ones that match your node.

Since the hash is consistent across runtimes you get the same answer for each unit of work, on each server.  Thereby allowing each node to decide what it processed or not, consistently, without communication (except cluster population).

You really only have to watch population changes.  That's when you have the likelihood of duplicate processing.  But idempotent workloads and all."

Those first years were insane.  Both of us hypomanic in turns.  We had no limits.  That first summer we only left the apartment for work and food.  Rest of the time we were in bed.

Kids evened us out a bit but it wasn't until a few years ago that I was finally diagnosed and we had a name for my crazy, which is intense.  Now we have full knowledge of what's happening.

bipolar,ff5z8st,t1_ff5wpyo,1579614957.0,"I'm feeling wise so you get some more.  In martial arts we cultivate a state where conscious thought doesn't really control us, we register and react by muscle memory.  That leaves our brain open to analyze, plan and adapt.

This state is called flow, or just being in the moment.  It comes with it a thread of thought, a voice that watches you perform, the outside observer.  Your body still functions, your brain is on autopilot and your actions are automatic.
Your brain is in essence watching itself.  This outside observer is completely dispassionate, you can't step outside of your body and drag emotions with you.

I find that it helps in bipolar as well.  It's interesting to watch yourself do something entirely insane, judge it dispassionately as such and still do it.  But if you can get yourself to listen to that outside observer voice, it cuts through all the cycles, all the emotions and just gives you information.  It might be a bit buried under whatever baggage you might have but I think everyone can have one.

I had to brutalize myself on the mat to find mine.  So much baggage in the way before.  Took years to find it, a few more to listen to it.  Still not a constant.  It so easy to lie to yourself."

Anyways, how it manifests is different for everyone, and changes over time as we become more aware and regain control over some behaviors.

You will have a subset of the experiences of others, not the complete experience.  Unless you are having delusions and hallucinations I don't expect you to lose memories, but that's just my experience.

Also some behaviors crop up on some parts of the cycle but we don't exhibit them on others.  Not every cycle will be the same, I get super fixated some cycles and totally distracted and slightly others.

What it boils down to is a trend, or cycle that becomes evident.  This cycle causes you trouble in your life or you wouldn't have sought help.

You therapist will help you more than I but the first step in controlling problematic behaviors is recognizing them.  The first step in managing bipolar is recognizing when you are in a state that is ""off"".  You do this by reflecting on your actions and judging them.  You will find your own red flags but when I snap at someone it's a pretty good sign I need to be in my room for a couple days.

So whether you have bipolar or not doesn't really matter.  It's just a label they put on things so they know kind of what to expect and how to help.  What matters is starting to recognize and track in your head the things you want to change.  Emotions are just information.  Actions can be choices.

Whatever, I'm trending up so you got me on a talkative day."
bipolar,ff5vo2i,t1_ff4ccfd,1579611824.0,"How you react to your meds short term does not on any way dictate whether you have bipolar.  Using that criteria in your thought process does you a disservice.

Think about what the criteria for diagnosis is.  No where does it say ""doesn't react to abilify"", or ""doesn't have episodes the day they quit their meds"".

They measure these things on the span of a year.  Even rapid cycling only cycles a few times a year (total bullshit btw, I go manic way more than that, even on meds).  So fix your thoughts, cause right now you are far into a red herring.

Think about what it feels like to cycle.  That tightness, the fuzzy thoughts, the lost memories, the irratibility, the flashes of anger, the buying shit, the inability to shut up.  Those are what you should be tracking.
