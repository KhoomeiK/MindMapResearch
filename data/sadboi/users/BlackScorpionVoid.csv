People do not understand what it feels like to struggle with the darkness. I have been having some very bad days the last few days and I have not really talked to anyone and have been withdrawing myself from people. It is a cycle.

I have not been able to find proper ways to completely manage mine, but the best thing so far is just to find things that keep you busy. Drawing, coloring, reading. Reading really helps, you get lost in a world that is not yours, be someone else for a while.

Well this night I randomly decided at this party, where all the other girls were just pretending to be drunk, well I decided to mix a shit ton of vodka with monster energy drinks... cause I am smart. 

I blacked out by 8pm. Woke up sometime around midnight or so. Only threw up once, but apparently I was throwing up while I was blacked out and clogged my friend's bathroom sink  with pizza. Hey at least I made it to the sink. No one informed me what happened in those hours besides that they couldn't keep me on the couch. Though I honestly think I died for a moment because at some point I remember a dream or something of everyone carrying me up the stairs and I was standing behind them. 

But when I woke up I was up stairs on my friends bed alone. I went down stairs to use the bathroom. That is when I found the puke. 

I went home shortly after and slept a bit longer. Surprisingly no headache or anything just tired from lack of sleep. 

Later the next day I was on the phone with my bff, who wasnt there, and he told me I was calling him almost every 5-15 mins getting louder and louder laughing and everything. And apparently threatening to kick people in the balls, and also apparently went down a flight of stairs on my knees. So sounds like it mightve been a cool night, if I wasn't blacked out.

Well of course there were more feelings there. And even though it took a few years after highschool for me to start feeling bad about not telling her the truth, it started to weigh on me. Though I have never dated a girl at this point I thought I would possibly try.   
Well she came here to see me, since we live states apart. But I still couldnt tell her and she still didnt know. 

I ended up telling her a couple months after that. And well yeah we basically arent friends anymore. She said she just couldnt date me, which I understood. But of course still wanted to be friends.
