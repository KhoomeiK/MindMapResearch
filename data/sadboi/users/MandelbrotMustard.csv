schizophrenia,fi67kmv,t1_fi5axkc,1582181900.0,I do understand this and that’s why I’m worried. What is it about the drugs that increase chance of development so much? I have already done them many times so I feel like if I have schizophrenia I should have gotten some symptoms by now no?
schizophrenia,fi67d4l,t1_fi5a302,1582181667.0,How many times did you do mushrooms (or any other drug) before getting symptoms?
schizophrenia,fi67b1p,t1_fi54udx,1582181602.0,Did you develop schizophrenia from psychedelics? If so how long did it take? Because I feel like I have done LSD so many times by now it would have already happened. I don’t know if this is how it works but I hope it is
