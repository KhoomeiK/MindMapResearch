(I know, I know. I have bpd too and understand this reaction, these thoughts and first reaction to what I‚Äôll say here. But hear me out.)

First, I want you to know that this absolutely says NOTHING about your : worth, looks, sexual abilities or anything else. This says woooorlds about the other two, though. 

Secondly, your boyfriend is scum. He does not respect you or your relationship and possibly, knows he can manipulate your emotions into staying with him because of your BPD. Double FUCK HIM for that. His skanky friend can fuck off too, assuming she knew he was your boyfriend and vice-versa.

Your worth is not dependent on other people‚Äôs thoughts and actions. You did not and do not deserve this. That woman is not ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than you. Both are shady, untrustworthy assholes.

It hurts. I know it‚Äôs overwhelming and the blame and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù will be put on yourself but it does not belong to you. It‚Äôs okay to hurt. It‚Äôs okay to cry and feel pain and hurt over this. It‚Äôs okay to be angry. You have the right to those emotions and the reaction to them is only under your control. Leave him. He doesn‚Äôt deserve YOU and YOU do not deserve to suffer mentally any more than BPD will already make you, over someone else‚Äôs mistreatment."

Screw assessing him and whether or not he was ACTUALLY going to hurt you here and take a look at yourself. Not that his actions would be your fault but to why you don‚Äôt value yourself and your safety more than this dude. The fact you even need to question, *seriously question* whether or not this was an event where he could have harmed you should be reason enough to get him out of your life and away from you.
