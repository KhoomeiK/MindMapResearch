bipolar2,f1mrg7l,t1_f1ltod2,1569600498.0,"yeah the being kind to myself thing is what I'm working on – whenever Ive had serious stuff to do with mental health happen I just waited for treatment to get done to immediately go back to overworking myself. I've learnt not to do it but the brain is still like WEEEWOOOO you SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE

I also isolate myself tons when depressed so trying to distinguish between healthy break and that is what I'm working on

as for coping I write a lot on my diary and have talking therapy. been interested in CBT but dunno where to start

thanks for your reply :)"
bipolar2,f16an1n,t3_d7x7mb,1569206935.0,proud of you! it's so hard to reach a year and you should be super proud of your milestone 🖤
BipolarReddit,f0s7gq8,t1_f0rhko0,1568900169.0,"thank you for such a caring reply! I have a wonderful therapist already and have made the medication mistake before (never again) but I guess my main challenge is going to be balance/figure out the idea of hypomania and productivity, because I overload myself when I'm feeling good then the depression hits for a month and everything is doomed. I've had one major mania episode (medication induced) and smaller ones that are paranoia based – it's a relief to know more people have also. Thanks again!"

AskReddit,ezhuybl,t3_d126qe,1567916953.0,"I speak six languages and pick up many words in others very easily – honestly in my mind I just speak in ""comprehensible"", which is a mix of everything, often the same word in three diff languages before I reach the one I want lmao but idk if that's atypical (English is my third language, for reference)"
productivity,ez13djq,t3_czqjls,1567644790.0,i Really struggle with that too and honestly it takes a lot of practice to get your brain out of that loop - CBT gives some tools - but it's fundamental to do some daily exercises on de-escalating your thoughts and being kinder to urself (and understand that it will take a while and sometimes you'll go back to it etc) it's like rewiring ur thought process

I've experienced both of those feelings & I'm like best friends with my ex boyf from teen days in the most platonic way and I thought that companionship was romance, ANYWAY. doesn't help for me that so much of my experience with men is embroiled in severe trauma so it's hard to unpick... but ultimately women good and also I have never wanted to make out and grow old and build a house in the woods with many dogs and a cat with a man so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

Re: etiolating, shes at a space with tons of light everyday and I live in a tropical country :/ the stretched out root was with her when she came along, pre all the flowers, and I didn't want to alter it cause i wasn't sure if safe, as I'm quite a beginner...do you have any advice on that? thank you!"
SapphoAndHerFriend,eyao5lp,t1_eyaefo1,1566966330.0,"Different experience but talking about confusion, I identified as bi *forever* and kind of never took myself as straight but am now, in my 20s, deconstructing the whole thing and my kinda attraction to men (which I literally have no clue if I even feel spontaneously or have just convinced myself I should feel) which makes me currently wonder if Ive actually just been gay all along.
