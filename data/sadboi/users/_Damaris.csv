Shihtzu,f8xmqbg,t1_f8x4vac,1574924301.0,"Honestly, my tzus rarely bark anymore. Sometimes if they witness activity/loud noise out a window, they'll bark intermittently. That's normally only if the subject is very nearby. I'll watch them sit and watch the neighbor kids playing across the street and they usually don't make a peep, unless a stray dog goes past in our yard or things like that. Even then, sometimes they'll just do that quiet ""boof"" noise. They will bark if someone knocks on my door but I'm trying to counter-condition them on that by giving treats when someone knocks so they learn that knocking is indicative of receiving treats and not something bad/scary. They are pretty receptive to it. Other breeds I have owned are dachshunds, a dalmatian, and a lab/shepherd mix. My tzus have barked the least out of all of them.

Since you live in an apartment my best advice would be to just make sure your dog can't see out a window while you're gone. I know, that can be easier said than done. It was difficult in my apartment because it was very small and I had a very long sliding glass door setup in the  living room. I ended up having to get one of those wire pens that come apart so you can turn it into more of a fence and I just stretched that along the length of it while I was at work to keep my female away from the windows."
Shihtzu,f8lcw7f,t3_e11lph,1574621061.0,"I have two shih tzus and their personalities differ in some ways but overall I LOVE them for my lifestyle.

My tzus get groomed every 2-3 months. Between professional grooms, I keep up on brushing them and bathe them as needed (my female LOVES to get wet/muddy).

Before I moved in with my significant other, my tzus were left alone in my apartment 9-11 hours a day with few issues while I was at work. My female is a perfect angel and does not have separation anxiety nor is she destructive. I set up a doggie cam and she just sleeps the entire time I'm gone and always has (she is 5 years old now). My male went through a bout of separation anxiety for a few months which getting some Trazodone from the vet helped 100%. I ended up having to crate him while I'm gone and I still do, because after a few hours he actually will start chewing on things. He is no longer on Trazodone now that I live with my partner because his separation anxiety has basically gone away completely since he isn't alone so much anymore.

The only issue I had with my female being left out and alone for hours on end, was I did receive complaints from a neighbor one time because my little girl apparently barked incessantly out the sliding glass doors. Both of my tzus will tend to bark at squirrels or if they can see people/other dogs passing by, so maybe keep that in mind when leaving them alone.

All things considered, if you had told me years ago I would own a shih tzu, let alone two, I would have said you were crazy. Having gotten fond of tzus since working professionally with dogs for years, I decided to get one, then I found I had to get another. They are seriously wonderful dogs and I have found they tend to do whatever you want to do. Want to go for a walk and play fetch? Heck yeah! Want to sleep in and relax all day? Heck yeah! They aren't fussy like some other breeds who constantly want you to do other things. They just want to chill next to you (or in the case of my male, he is actually kind of more like a cat and prefers to just lay on the back of the sofa until he decides he wants cuddles from you. But my female follows me EVERYWHERE).

Some people think small breeds are kind of pansies when it comes to the weather but I'm here to tell you both of my tzus love playing in the snow and it's hard to get them inside on a snowy day. My male sort of doesn't like the rain sometimes, but my female loves the chance to get wet and splash in puddles/roll in the mud. My female also LOVES playing frisbee. People laugh all the time at the dog park because they say they've never seen a shih tzu so obsessed with a frisbee.

A couple of things to keep in mind - shih tzus tend to have dry skin and runny/watery eyes which makes them prone to get tear stains. Give me those issues any day however compared to some of the other medical issues other breeds are prone to. Oh, and tzus are prone to eating feces as well, which both of mine do incessantly despite my efforts to try and get them to stop. This is just in their DNA as tzus are an older breed and very genetically close to wolves actually (and wolves eat feces for a good reason, so tzus just think they have to be cool and do it too). If your tzu ends up being a voracious poo-eater, there are different things you can research to try, like putting pineapple on their food which apparently makes the poo taste unappealing to some dogs. This doesn't always work though. This is something to keep in mind because my female especially treats any and all animal poo on her walk like a buffet and will gobble it up quickly, so I've always got to keep a close eye on her.

Anyway, I highly recommend this funny, lovable breed!"

Thetruthishere,f1pfrbs,t3_da6kdv,1569679497.0,"A few years ago I dreamed I was in the backseat of a car. There was one other person in the backseat with me, one driver, and one person in the passenger seat up front.

We were driving steadily toward some train tracks in the distance. The driver sped up and I began to get panicked as I saw the train approaching.

""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""We're not going to make it!""

""I think we can make it,"" the driver replied, speeding up even faster now. I remember gripping the seats as I screamed, along with the other passengers. There was no time for any other reaction. I woke up with a start as the train collided into our vehicle.

Shaking off the dream, I went into my kitchen to make some coffee. My significant other at the time was sitting in their normal spot, drinking coffee and watching the morning news. I stood there in shock as I saw the current story on our television screen about a vehicle that got struck by a train killing the people inside - of which there were three.

I just kept saying, ""Oh my god,"" and had to sit down. I felt shaky. I have never dreamed about a train in all 32 years of my life until that dream.

Unfortunately, this wasn't a dream that allowed me to warn anyone, allowing them to escape. So I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but still thought I would share."
