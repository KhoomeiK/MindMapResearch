depression,fafmd9b,t3_e8ybup,1576026401.0,"I feel you dude. I feel you. You expressed yourself clearly here. First, what’s the different points of this person from your exes? What makes you think that this person is different from the previous ones? and please ask yourself? Why did these words make you feel valuable and safe? Can you describe to be valuable and safe? Is that only human who provide these feelings to you in the world? Everybody wants to hear some kind of these words, it’s so normal but is it really a sign of value? What do you really need lately?

And vital point, I think you should disclose these with your therapist because your therapist stand for you in therapy room for this reason and this event maybe related to another issue and you can solve these with from moving here. Also, therapists don’t be judgemental. this will be contrary to ethics. so don’t afraid."

Instagram,f7j7gzl,t3_dwff2a,1573772090.0,"I think “likes” related to person’s popularity and some people buy likes themselves for feel more popular. Also we conditioned likes with beauty even if they are not. We try to measure beauty with likes nowadays unconsciously. This update maybe decrease these kind of thoughts. Also, maybe this update developed for decreasing the influencers’ ad income. Maybe Instagram wants to out of third party between itself and ad providers. Isn’t it?"

I guess you're full of some feelings such as anxiety, hopelessness, etc. and you cannot how to cope with them, therefore you feel constant discomfort. if you wanna go home you need to know first the where are you now and address. after, you need to overcome the potentially challenging path. try to explain yourself your feelings. why and how long you feel this way? what would you feel more comfortable with? try to look inside yourself, your thoughts and feelings.
