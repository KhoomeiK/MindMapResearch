But be very flexible in knowing that the answer might be just no or the answer could be yes but may be stopped in a moments notice and you may need to comfort her instead. Learn not to take it personally and be open to learning what exactly during sex might be what’s making her uncomfortable. Enjoy the moment when you can have sex but be ready if it doesn’t work out to sit down later, or whenever she’s comfortable, and see if she is willing to explain what was possibly triggering her. 

Just like anyone you have to learn your partner in bed. This will just mean you have to pay very close attention and have more communication than the average person does when they do have sex. Just think of this as a way to get to know her and her trauma better. It sounds scary and it is for you and her, but if you can communicate and be vulnerable together (and considerate with that vulnerability) you will become very close and have an even deeper bond. In the long run, this will be something you’ll always have to deal with in some way. But it can get easier for the both of you and the time spent on making this right for the both of you can really be something special that you can share. You’d end up with a very unique sexual bond literally tailored for each other. I wish you luck!"

Sad thing is what you hould focus on is NOT hurting someone. 

This is unnecessary. When the majority of the population thinks that ANYONE who says they were r\*ped while they were drunk ""just regret it"". You're continuing a really shitty trend by encouraging people to automatically assume someone ""just regrets it"". Your focus on ruining a man's life is actually what most of society says to erase people who WERE r\*ped. The amount of false accusations are NEVER anywhere near the amount of r\*pes. So, why is there always disproportionality more of a fight for men who were accussed than women who were silenced????????? 

Why dont you think about the consequences of the things you say in relation to how the world is. ESPECIALLY right now. Do you not realize that anyone who r\*pes someone, majority of the time, thinks they would never do that. That's why there's r\*pe culture. Everyone thinks it's wrong, everyone says no one should do it, but it KEEPS HAPPENING. And it KEEPS being swept under the rug by people constantly saying THIS. The literal r\*pist out there that think they could've never done such a thing explain it away with the same logic you're promoting. Because NO ONE WANTS TO BE A R\*PIST. BUT SOMEONE. MANY SOMEONES ARE. Self preservation makes them say ""she just was drunk and regretted it later"". THIS is NOT unpopular. Look at the upvotes. (The stupid idea that you upvote what's unpopular is a ploy to make you upvote everything whether you like it or not. So, no. These upvotes are the thousands of people who agree with you.) And amongst those, I'm 1000000% statistically, a LOT of people have r\*ped and/or harrassed SOMEONE. You just made a ton of people afraid to ever speak up.

Thyroid problems, reaction to life saving medication, mental health and more. Therefore, neutralizing the body is the movement you should be looking at. And YES it is fat shaming to not include things for overweight people who cannot be average weight, or hell, less than average (models). Excluding people in everyday society when they cannot get skinny as fast or as much as society says they should. Is not okay. But at least fat acceptance isn’t telling people they aren’t worth anything unless they look like x person which creates eating disorders. Another thing, telling someone who is fat that being skinnier is the healthier choice is extremely detrimental to those who are fat and have eating disorders. You cannot tell how much work people are putting in by the way they look. Even infinidad people, you do not know how much stuff they are doing in their life to be healthier just by looking at them. There are MANY people who are eating right and working out and just are fat. Believe it or not. And there’s many people who are in the middle of their journey to losing weight for their health. But I wish people cared about people’s mental health than how unsightly someone else looks to them. 

There  is no where near the amount of support for mental health. 
Bc let’s say someone is fat from overeating. Do you know what causes overeating?? It’s not a lack of discipline it’s almost always a link to a mental health problem. So saying those who are fat because of “choices” you have now diminished their value as a person, invalidated their traumas, and erased and mental health struggles. The problem with people against the body positive movement is that you are showing you care more about how some looks or even how their body works but care nothing about their mental state and WHO they are. HOW a they feel about themselves. 

At least body positivity and body neutral movements are about learning to be happy in yourself. It is sad to see so many people underestimate the need for better mental health advocacy. And actively and ignorantly stand against it by saying “body positivity promotes obesity”.  People who are like this as healthy as they seem and are just not fat. It’s a privileged position to be in to not have these struggles. The entire society sí not build on telling you you’re wrong Bc you’re unhealthy within it’s literal infrastructure. These movements are about taking care of your mind. Bc being “healthy” or skinny doesn’t mean you are happy and can lead to death just as well.

I realized something was off when she made it a point to tell me “I’m your mom. Not your friend” like it was a job. She’d boss me around like i was her maid at home after long hours of school and extracurriculars in a way that made me feel like a slave. She told me “how do you think people would see me as a mother if you killed yourself” when I was recommended by a school counselor to go into a psych hospital at 15. I always felt like there was a disconnect. She cried in front of me once and i almost laughed Bc it was out of character. I remember getting frustrated wi5 her trying to tell her that she had made me have my mental health problems. I knew she did but I couldn’t explain how she did it. So, I think I’ve known deep down, it wasn’t right because I thought “arent parents supposed to en the people you wanna go to for everything?” And I was keeping the fact that I was depressed to myself for years. I didn’t wanna tell my mom anything ever. I felt like that had to be wrong. But I started to think maybe I was wrong thinking that was what parents were supposed to be like. I started second guessing myself. 

I really didn’t realized it until this past winter when my boyfriend said “your mom sounds like a narc” after  listening to a phone call conversation she and I (really her talking at me). He has a couple of nrelatives and he and his mother knew a lot about the disorder(?). Then, I met his parents. His mom and I talked about having an nmom and she suggested resources to me.

But in the last few months, we’ve been struggling really badly and I wonder if raising kids is right for us to do. We decided not to have our own because we feel it would be unethical to add to the children on earth due to the environment and I do have the fear of passing on mental issues. We hadn’t necessarily decided we couldn’t even adopt, but lately I think maybe we won’t be able to. It’s kinda sad that illness can put a detour or change on achieving some of your dreams. 

But I think at this point, focusing on us and our animals might be as far as we can go when it comes to raising someone. I’ve sort of started to think this is where we are headed. And I’m becoming very content in that. But hey, maybe we can get to a stable place and adopt one day, who knows. 

But I agree with the OP, if you have mental health problems, consider seriously what that means with having a child if you have the chance to plan it out. That could mean for the child, but even for you. Think about how you may have to stop your medications while pregnant. Are you capable of doing that? (I personally miss one day, and I am a wreck.) Can you go 9 months? Do you have a plan if the child develops or show early signs of mental illness too? That’s just aside from the questions about raising them after they are born like: can you handle rough nights where your baby will waking you up every hour? Can you react appropriately to their tantrums etc.? Can you remember to do self care? Can you handle stress when they become young adults with very active lives and learning their own coping? Or would having kids be a good thing for you?!There’s a lot of questions to think about from both yours and the possible child’s perspective on if it is the right thing to do. 


But! If you have a child already, make sure you take care of yourself! Bc 1. You deserve it and 2. Your kids deserve you to be at your best. If you’re planning, don’t rule it completely out but think about it deeply and keep doing the treatment you need in the meantime!

I feel guilty because now she is 12 and I'm living on campus but she is stuck with my nmom. Meaning all she does is stay is her little room and sleep. I feel horrible for the amount of time she's been back there alone as I tried to keep my life afloat with my nmom, mental illness, school, and extracurriculars. I regret how she's been treated with us. My mom likes to say ""when she's gone......"" like she's waiting for her to die. Sometime I feel like I've been ruining her life. But I'm very grateful she is in mine and has been there for me as a kid and teen into adulthood."

For example, she bought me a car. I didn't ask for it. But she did. Now she complains about how i need to do more and buy her groceries bc she can no longer afford it bc she's paying for my car. Im not allowed to drive it alone even tho I've had my license for 7+ months. She drives it more than i do. Im talking about 20ish days out of the month bc it's more fuel efficient than her SUV, while i drive it once or twice every two weeks MAYBE. I pay half of the insurance. And when I'm home, i have to pay for gas. Even tho I'm not driving it. Like i said, once or twice every two weeks if im lucky. She also complains about the maintenance. But if i do anything that's not to her liking. She bought me a car. I should be more grateful.

One time she took me to europe. Europe is great. With my nmom no. There is vegan dominos in Europe. Not in the US so i wanted to go to it right around the corner. My mom said no and we went to a restaurant instead. Only options were a small salad and fries. I was pissed. Not bc of the lack of options. I'm used to that in that kind of restaurant setting. But bc my mom got mad at me for eating too many of the fries when that was one of my two options as she ate a full meal. And domino's was right across the street. Some stuff happened, i got angry and walked outside for fresh air and so i wouldn't make a scene. She got very angry and told me i was ungrateful, she would never buy me tickets to Europe again.

unpopularopinion,fjoiuj3,t1_fjls30v,1583528622.0,"Your point about a lazy mindset means you are ignorant to the many reasons a person can be fat. Medication, genes, trauma, an other underlying condition like thyroid problems. You assume fat people aren’t working out, that’s false. You CANNOT tell someone health regime by the way they look. There are people with very healthy lifestyles that are by social standards fat. Your last sentence is contradictory. You do not deep down think it is fantastic that people are being inclusive. You are close in one aspect. It is a mental. However, it’s not due to laziness for those who are fat and aren’t leading healthy lives. It can be due to underlying mental problems. But you tell me, how telling someone they are more inadequate as a human being because they are fat to a person who is obese and unwilling to change due to residual feeling of inadequacy from, say, being abused as a child? 

Being okay with being fat is a mindset that is put out because 1. Some people are just fat. No matter how they workout and eat healthy. 2. Some people cannot help their medical situation. If they have to take meds to stay alive being fat shouldn’t be looked down on while they DO show determination, just not how you see it. 3. Telling people being fat isnt okay, promotes eating disorders and makes being fat a character flaw. It sets back people in recovery. 4. Those who may be infinifat or how you may know them as “morbidly obese” deserve a life where they see themselves as a person not a gross thing to look at by society disguised in people saying they are looking out for their “health”. 5. People want to live and be happy and not focus their entire life on being skinny or “healthy”. What’s the point in living a long life if you’re a slave to food or the concept of being healthy? If you are unhappy?


One last thing, I recognize you put this in the “vegan” mega thread out of lack of options. You could have just posted it. Putting it under veganism is damaging. It promotes veganism as a diet. It is not, it is a lifestyle. Plant based is a the diet. But even then, putting with an idea that “fat isn’t okay” promotes restrictive eating. Plant based diets aren’t harmful. But paired as a way to lose weight, it’s dangerous. It feels like that is the connection here whether you meant it to be or not. I hope you’ll consider this and the rest I’ve said. Wish you well."
unpopularopinion,fjjss72,t3_fdnjn2,1583411008.0,"Some people do believe it doesn’t happen to men. Poor education sí to thank for that. However, most contexts that I’ve seen, people VERY much know it happens to men. And the people in comments (I see it online a lot) just said “what about men” as a way to move the conversation away and onto themselves. Which is disrespectful. It’s just tiring to see survivors undermine each other by saying “men too” or even “women too” in various contexts. I wish we could come together as a collective, and watch our language when talking about survivors. We shouldn’t forget stats in regards to those who aren’t discussed as much (men, natives, underdeveloped countries). And if we feel someone is being oppressive and erasing a group speak to them in a way that doesn’t cause disrespect to the survivors that they are talking about. I feel your frustration. I understand it. I hope we as a society can do better. Lastly, I hope you’ll consider putting a trigger warning before discussing these types of things in the future.

unpopularopinion,fj5wykq,t3_fbldy8,1583046306.0,"Some people blast it for various reasons. We ALL want validation. Just because you get your validation other ways does not mean you should hate on others who are more vocal. Now i say there is a difference between being actually upset and sad because if a short term thing. But i have to stop people on this: ""just because you post it, you're faking it"" bs. A quality we all have as people who suffer with these disorders is an inability to cope on our own or in healthy ways. Who are you to deem what is or isn't healthy for someone? Or judge their unhealthy behavior?  I say this because growing up my ONLY place to vent when i lived with my narcissistic and controlling mother, was online. I made an anonymous account and met a lot of people needing to vent as well. It was a futile but CLOSE community. This was when instagram was just getting started. This community still goes on. People who just need to vent anonymously needing solidaroty and support. Many people do this. Including me growing up. In a time i was developing and ALONE, feeling like something was VERY wrong with me.

The problem I have with people who write this post is: YOU are doing the SAME thing people do to US. Telling us nothing is wrong with us. When the truth is. No one knows what is really going on with someone. I KNEW i had massive depression. I was afraid to be diagnosed though and I was afraid to say that's what I knew I had BECAUSE of people who say the same thing this OP is. This kind of mindset pushes people who need help from getting it because they don't want to be an ""attention seeker"". When i was forced into hospitalization i was diagnosed with exactly what i KNEW I had. That I was only able to process and cope by posting my inner feelings online.

The world is changing. Technology is used as coping mechanisms and even healthy ones. Ive turned that old mechanism of posting my feelings into a better one because i learned what about that experience of posting online was helpful. Why is this such a strange concept????  Being public about how we feel??? Why are you so offended by someone having a breakdown? There is a lack of empathy in this opinion. Pity grab? It's called wanting validation and recognition something even YOU want. Just because you may do it differently doesn't mean you're above it and they are beneath you. If anything it should tell you they may need guidance on where to find professional help.

Can we PLEASE stop adding to the stigma our community already faces? Can we start seeing people who are having a breakdown and show some compassion????

Edit for clarification: I understand where the feelings of resentment come in. I get annoyed when people only think about Mental Health when a celebrity dies and post a hotline and never say anything about it again. This while we face depression EVERY SINGLE DAY. We don't get to forget about it. But any resentment that puts people down as BENEATH you. Is quite frankly very immature and apathetic. I hope we can learn to stop being so wrapped up in our own problems that we forget others have them too."

He was also, sadly, an inspiration to many black kids as well. So, yeah, I think the news is important. Important for the family. That people send their love. And important for the black community to know a major influencer for kids to go beyond their expected place in society has died, and for them to mourn.

But as a survivor I know, just Bc the government and society seems them as not guilty, doesn’t mean he wasn’t guilty. My point is, shitty people can make you learn big, good, things in life.
