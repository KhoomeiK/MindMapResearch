SuicideWatch,fqvtqeu,t3_gl7p94,1589684975.0,I can give you a bunch of reasons actually. Is there a tv series you haven't finished? Do you have books you want to read? What about a video game you haven't played yet? You cant listen to music if you're dead. The reason I didn't try last time was because I realized I had all these books to read and tv shows to finish and movies to watch. None of these are stupid reasons for me to not kill myself because any reason is a good one. I hear beastars is good. Twin peaks too.

SuicideWatch,fqvs6o1,t1_fqvpanu,1589683978.0,"I agree. You know which means you are capable of working on yourself to stop it. When I was in high school I was a terrible person. I would guilt trip people, gaslight them, manipulate their feelings, i was awful. I learned how shit of a person I was a year or two ago and I've been working hard to fix it. I haven't gotten a chance to work on some of my worse grievances because I have to be extremely close to someone to even have the opportunity to do what I used to and it's fucking hard. The shitty thing about being mean is that once you figure it out, you see it in everything. You learned to be this way for a reason, out of necessity. My sister is controlling and manipulative but it's because my dad was too and she was my dads favorite. Once you learn why, you can work on stopping it. The hard part about that is that you have to be hyper aware of everything you do so you know when you're doing something mean. You can't get better if you realize you did something stupid two days after you did it. This is hard and it's a process but I believe in you. You have good inside you and I can see that because you care so much about those you have wronged that you're doing something to fix it. I wouldn't say this is a good way to fix it but you're trying and that means so much.
In my opinion, a bad person doesn't usually care about their friends and family when they see they've wronged them. Give yourself another chance."

From googling crohns:

People may experience:
Pain areas: in the abdomen, joints, lower abdomen, or rectum
Pain types: can be mild or severe
Gastrointestinal: bloating, bowel obstruction, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or flatulence
Whole body: fatigue, fever, or loss of appetite
Anal: fissures or bleeding
Also common: cramping, depression, flare, mouth ulcer, slow growth, or weight loss"

Regardless of if you are or not, you should tell her if you haven't already. I know it's hard but you need to let her go.

I would break up with me back then if I was my bf at the time. What he's doing is self destructive behavior and what sucks is comforting him is enabling that behavior. If you talk to him, instead of comforting maybe you can say something like ""you're not a piece of shit but what you're doing still hurts. Can you think about working on that?""

When I was your age I was probably 160 which I think is a similar BMI to you now. Looking back now I'd just consider myself a bit chunky back then but not obese like I am now. I understand where you are.
I don't know your situation with your parents and friends and such but I'm willing to wager that you can't be that bad if you have friends. Friends get there somewhere and if you can, it's good to feel vulnerable somewhere where people you know care about you. You have a lot of life ahead of you. Are you particularly close to someone (preferably someone who won't tell a counselor or your parents) that you can go to about this? The only reason I'd say not to tell a counselor or parents is that they could enroll you in an inpatient facility which might further alienate you but it would only do that if you don't want to go to a facility."
SuicideWatch,fpz07i6,t1_fpyzghk,1589011199.0,I understand that. It's hard to give up on someone you love.

I hope you're still alive because I care about you even though I don't know you. If you're not, you still haven't failed me. Leaving this world will never fail me.

wholesomememes,fl2lnc3,t3_flvhse,1584753976.0,"I have a story about a cat. When I was around 14 or so, my mom, sister, and I took a volunteer position to help this old woman keep up with her house chores and stuff. She had dementia and wasn't able to organize anything or clean her cats litter box and other things. We cleaned her apartment up super good but eventually, her son decided to place her in a home and she couldn't take her cat. This cat was as old as me. She was 14, scared of us, and she didn't play. Old cats rarely get adopted and my mom knew I really loved cats so we volunteered to take her in. Her name was smokey and she lived in our shed at first. My dad didn't like her but eventually I caught him watching a late night show with smokey purring away on his lap. She didn't play but once she got to know us, she was a real snuggle bug. Eventually, around a few months later I convinced my dad to let her stay in our house and he let her. I was really happy. Eventually we take her to the vet and she gets diagnosed with FIV. Cool, she's an indoor cat now. She's pretty old, it happens.
Her next vet appointment she's diagnosed with some sort of kidney disease and the next appointment, she has a thyroid disease. Alright. This is fine, there are treatments. We give her thyroid pills every feeding and give her fluids once a week and she's going strong for five years. She starts to lose weight though and yesterday my mom took her to the vet and smokey has a euthanasia appointment on Monday. My mom knows how much I love her and smokey looked so comfortable  living with us. She'd be gone a lot sooner if she was left to a shelter. No one wants a cat that'll die in a few years. She was pampered for six years and I know she loved me. One time she stole the bread off my sandwich. Adopt an old cat. Adopt a cat with three legs. They're wonderful cats and I fully intend on my next cat being the most unadoptable cat my local shelter has. They deserve love so so much. If you have depression or anxiety and feel like your unlovable, that's what these cats feel like and when you love them, you're also proving to yourself that you deserve to be loved. I love smokey so much, all ""unadoptable"" cats should experience that amount of love."
