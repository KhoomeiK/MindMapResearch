Remember you likely will be meeting people who are also matured and will have a better, adult outlook on life compared to what u dealt with in the past. Ofcourse there are exceptions, and age= maturity but that could be one thing that's repulsing you and might make you more selective, sit down and think of exactly what you want and what you also can bring to the table for your partner and go from there."

Verified= alot of the times its that the Rx is ready in the bin or already been verified from the pharmacist, there could be a MSC on it or an exception that needs to be resolved, that's one common thing. There are other situations as well where it will be in verified status

OOS-> out of stock -> first scroll to see when the exception was created. If its before the cutoff time for the automatic order(around 5:30pm for us) then tell the customer it will be in the next day by 2pm/3pm. Tell them They will get an automated message when it's in stock, so make sure they are signed up for text messages/email to ensure they get it.

When someone comes to pick something up and it's not in the work queue, go to F9 -> central profile -> sort by last pickup date -> and see if there was anything stored that day or recently, or if the script was sent over to another store.
1) If it was sent to another store and it's not a control, ask If they would like you to pull it to your store and wait for 15 min to get it ready for them. 
- to pull a prescription that's sent to another store, 
1)press ""select"" then go to ""options"" when the script is pulled on the screen, then ""create new script""
2) before you ""Fill"" go to payment and change it to cash. This ensure that incase the claim was processed at the other store, you wont need to call the insurance to reverse the claim. 
3) press ""Fill"". Then go to the work queue, find the script, and update the fill. Change the Payment back to their Primary Insurance.
   
--> If they say no, go to a) Pharmacy MGMT -> Store Inquiry -> type in the store # to find out what store it got sent to.


 If there are no new scripts on their profile that they are asking for, check the F1's and see if it was sent there. You can do this by going to ""electronic Image Viewer"" and see if it's there or not. If not tell them to contact their provider if it's been a few hours to more than a day since they were supposed to send in a new script. Make sure they're signed up for texts/email always unless they really insist they dont want it.

If someone is picking up a script, and says they dont want to get one of them and it's ready, get the physical Rx, remove it from the bag, then find it in the work queue. ""Delete Rx to Stored"" 
This is important. If it's in ready status, you can ""delete it to Stored"" or if that option is not there, then press ""delete Rx"". 
Never ever press ""Delete Rx"" until you learn the differences between delete to stored and delete Rx. Ask some coworkers or the Rph for assistance with this."
MuslimMarriage,fd0v60u,t1_fd0tnwf,1578124189.0,"Hes too grown, if hes refusing help, just know you have done all you can. He will not accept help until he wants to do it from within, he has to want to do it. And I mean this in the most genuine way, do not let his wrongdoings affect your growth and your emotional state. You are not responsible for his actions. Focus on yourself, and let your parents deal with him if it's gotten that bad. You're not responsible for his actions. 

I completely understand the whole make haram-relations halal, but honestly I find this method to be harmful in the long run, but making things halal will still help him prevent zina. I know its usually done to save face and humiliation that the parents feel and any backlash for the community and also to help them stop committing zina. I think its selfish to say they get married because it ain't just that easy to divorce. Marriage isnt a game. Especially if they have issues and dont love each other. 

HOWEVER, If your mom really insists, as long as they're not married legally, and only islamically, that maybe easier. However from what I've seen it's difficult to find someone who will do a muslim marriage without the legal binding. 
I'm sorry sis, but I hope u stay strong and do as much as u can to not hold the burden of your brother.

MuslimMarriage,fd0pk1o,t3_ejta9f,1578122036.0,"How old is he? Is he in school, does he hold a job, any future goals you're aware of? 
From what you've revealed, it seems like he needs alot of work on himself before he can be in any relationship with anyone. He needs to notice his flaws and fix himself however he can even if that means going to therapy, getting help for any addictions. He may feel like his family is against him now as well and possibly this is his retaliation. If you have any type of relationship with him, try to still be there for him and have him trust you as his sibling to come to u if he needs to talk (ofcourse,if hes not abusive towards you and ur relationship is okay etc.). 

Marriage is NOT the answer, your feelings sound completely valid imo. Marriage is the last thing he should be doing rn if hes this unstable.
These are just a few things I can note from the top of my head, and I'm sure others will have some additional opinions and advice iA."

Which is such a ridiculous amount even with high end makeup products, unless u have a serious skin condition u are not disclosing. Makeup does expire, so you essentially are spending thousands on products you probably will not even use all of them or finish before they expire. 

Second, recieving gifts of makeup from your SO is probably gonna happen, if he doesn't rlly care about makeup but he knows it makes you happy. I can see that being acceptable for sure. Idk how common it is for guys to willingly spend thousands on products for you, but If u find that guy, then lucky day for ya. I personally wouldn't feel right asking him to pay so much money if I'm not contributing or if i have an income that I'm not utilizing for overall financial decisions in the marriage. 

As for laser, that can be something you guys split together. If he's willing to help or to even pay for your treatments, that's great  and nothing wrong with it if it makes both of you happy."

MuslimLounge,eq4peek,t3_bv5ucy,1559782294.0,"This was one of the most meaningful Ramadan's I have experienced yet in my life. I felt so peaceful and that I really do belong and found comfort in worship and closer to my deen. I have been more of a cultural muslim, where I dont really pray and I went astray with my faith, but alhamdulillah I feel so much better this Ramadan and got sad it ended. The unity and peace was amazing for my mental health and rekindled my faith much more strongly than before. I accomplished reading the Quran and took the time to understand God's words. I still have alot more to go but I feel accomplished nonetheless and ready to continue the good habits and hopefully starting to contonuously pray again 5 times a day rather than zero. I think I really needed this Ramadan, and even a few of my really close friends have felt the same way about Ramadan this year."
