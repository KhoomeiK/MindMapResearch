minimalism,fqimebs,t1_fp13cfv,1589397938.0,"no worries about rambles! thank you for explaining your thought process throughout the post, it is helpful! because i have a list of all the nice staples i need too but i can tell sometimes its creating more because im like ""yes this will go with my wardrobe"" so that lets me process ""okay so i need to just think about what i need to replace that when my current staples are at the end instead of bringing more in"" 
and the last few paragraphs make sense! that there has to be a balance and having to draw a line somewhere. so i have already streamlined with all the pieces i do acutally like but since i have too much, im going to put it into a couple diff boxes and try to rotate them. (because i can keep stuff with my parents, and i can rotate the boxes of clothes everytime i come back to save space in the shared room im moving into) 
hope that is making sense if thats what you want to try too! i think another post i have, somebody explained the rotation method (love box) im talking about. üòÅ"

I have diagnosed OCD and honestly ive just realized that my ocd has literally trickled into everything and it sucks. Long story short I was on meds/therapy in 2018 but my therapist was actual trash so my motivation to keep going with that fell haaard. But last month I went back and found a much better therapist who seems like we can actually address shit. She did mention my symptoms are ADHD similar as well. I think I kind of knew that my post was related to my compulsions and hearing someone else similar have this thought process feels very nice so thank for that

Also that is very true with minimalism and luxury about getting rid of everything just to buy something again. I do believe that people have made things very black and white when it comes to that. I guess its just about finding a balance and being realistic with yourself but not to the point where you start convoluting this perfect thing"
