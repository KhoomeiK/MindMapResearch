Coronavirus,fnx4rwu,t1_fnwjuvm,1587331465.0,"Actually, yes.  For the last two months, I volunteer at my local grocery store to restock their frozen and bread section Tuesday and Thursday mornings for four hours at a time.  My small community has had a shortage of workers even before the virus hit There are regularly 4-8 people who do it with me each time.  Everyone is wearing masks, gloves, long sleeves, and pants as we load and unload pallets with cases of food on them.  It sucks to wear a mask if it‚Äôs not properly fitted or slips.  At least once a shift, I‚Äôve had to take a quick break to wash my hands so I can reposition my mask or blow my nose (allergies). We are all breathing hard and generally get into each other‚Äôs bubble often.  Masks help lower the risk."

Now is the time to put both cash and action to use not only for the church and its members but for its communities and ministries.

KindVoice,f8mb4i0,t3_e12bp6,1574629756.0,"I had an outburst today at the dinner table.  I got upset and stormed away from the table.  A few hours later, my teenage daughter started crying and being upset about not having done her homework and feeling like she is always wasting time and unmotivated.   I believe my behavior lately is spreading.  I‚Äôm bringing others down and I‚Äôm not sure how to stop.  I love my husband and kids so much.  I want to be a positive and inspiring influence but all I seem to do is the opposite.   I used to be that way then I lost myself.  Gotta stop doing this before they stop wanting to be around me. Gotta get back up and try again.  Do it for me.  Do it for them.  I‚Äôm not sure how to do it though.  I want to say I‚Äôm sorry to my family and specifically my teenage daughter whether it be literally or with actions. Any suggestions?"

Good luck with your move and enjoy your new plant babies!
