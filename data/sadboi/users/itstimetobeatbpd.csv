DoesAnybodyElse,fqz6gj2,t3_glcbj6,1589760870.0,I straight up do the “lalalala I can’t hear you!” To myself anytime a memory pops up that I don’t like. Works like a charm!
AnimalCrossing,fqv75rd,t3_gkz4xy,1589671238.0,Seeing islands with names like this make me feel so much better about my island name. I didn’t think people would see it and then After seeing all these cute names I regretted mine right away. So thank you owner of poopoopee

AskReddit,fqe1tt3,t1_fqe0r6p,1589300369.0,No kidding! You have to be a really mentally strong person for it to even come close to working long term.
AskReddit,fqe077w,t3_gie42p,1589299595.0,One of mine is that if a company hires you on the spot it isn’t because you’re so great they have to jump at the chance. It’s because they are a garbage company that usually has an extremely toxic work environment. It is okay to weigh your options and really look into a company before you decide to work there.

It is hard for me to accept my actual weight so I always have to remind myself that what I see is not real and I need to work on being healthy. So seeing myself in videos is absolutely devistating.

offmychest,foxdk47,t1_foxdfbe,1588140775.0,That’s always how it feels. Like an unnecessary comment to try to get a rise out of the person. I hate it and I am over it. You think what you want and I’ll think what I want and unless the conversation is brought up by both people just shut your mouth. Gaaah
offmychest,fox5kpi,t1_fox4t8o,1588134620.0,Thank you! And if they don’t want to talk about it just don’t. It’s not that hard.
offmychest,fowzab0,t3_g9zl6w,1588130400.0,"This EXACT same thing happened to me, but it wasn't a school bathroom. It was the one at work. And the building had only four rooms all connected to the bathroom and I stunk up the whole office. It was awful and I still cringe when i think about it."
offmychest,fowyuib,t1_fowychn,1588130129.0,It just always makes me laugh when someone realizes that I don't think the same way that they do and then they blow up on me like I am some demon out to destroy the world.  Like I knew exactly what you believed and I was able to be your friend without making some huge deal about it. Just chill and enjoy my company. We do not need to agree on everything. And dont yell at me to shut up when I am explaining how i see things. Like wtf.
offmychest,fowyopr,t3_g9y6t5,1588130026.0,"I really struggled with this when i lost weight and when i gained it back. My last boyfriend made my weight such a big deal that i am now really struggling to lose it because it almost feels like the only way to find someone who loves me for me is to be overweight. I don't want to be unhealthy but I have such a negative view of losing weight now. I feel like it will never be good enough. 

&#x200B;

I am so happy that you lost weight for you and just remember that things are different but there are always signs to shitty people. Once you see a red flag, leave. Do that for you. I know you will find someone amazing. Just protect yourself in the way that you feel is best for you."

The best thing that you can do when you truly believe they are a threat to themselves is to call their parents or call the police. They will be mad for a little while, but getting them help is the most important thing you can do. You cannot handle this alone and it will break you down. It is okay to ask for someone else’s help. You are doing what is best for them, and getting them they help they need."

DoesAnybodyElse,fnehosx,t1_fne43ue,1586889557.0,Await further instructions. I thought it was awesome and actually liked the meaning behind it. But it is a shot movie. Still worth a watch. If you want a horrible movie that is so bad it’s amazing look up Bitch Slap. One of my favorites by far.

We watched this god awful movie where the side effects looked straight out of the 80s but it was so bad that I was busting up laughing and totally loving it. All he did was complain the whole time about how stupid and bad it was. He couldn’t even enjoy it at all and made me feel stupid for thinking it was the best crap movie I had ever seen. 

Find someone who loves the same shit movies and amazing shows that you love!"
