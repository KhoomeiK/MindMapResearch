timothyheller,fpxuxxf,t3_gg3rkd,1588990096.0,"agreed, i try not to bring up the allegations because nobody can be proven guilty or innocent (i just believe some people *wink* were respectful  and cooperative and some were not) and i dislike how this woman tried to armchair diagnose Melanie Martinez with NPD (i disagree with throwing around a diagnosis for someone regardless of if it‚Äôs a joke or a theory) 

i think this is much more well researched and based on facts than Pipers videos. Like Piper would say things about the dates not adding up when that‚Äôs irrelevant because Melanie admitted there was a sexual encounter. And Piper said Melanie wasn‚Äôt wearing a wig in a photo because ‚ÄúThe wig is blonde and they don‚Äôt make wigs out of bleached blonde hair‚Äù even though 1. the wig was synthetic not real hair because this was before Melanie had as much money as she has now for expensive wigs and 2. her caption literally said something alone the lines of ‚ÄúI got a cookie on my weave‚Äù"
