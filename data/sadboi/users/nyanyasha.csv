cheating_stories,fr3wxl2,t3_gmgmwg,1589868620.0,"It’s possible to have feelings for more than one person. Polyamory exists and is much more common than some people think. Most people who cheat are actually not suited for a monogamous lifestyle. The problem is the lying, the going behind your partners back and disrespect. They do it, because they are unhappy and immature. Mostly unhappy with themselves and their lives. Because they probably feel trapped in a monogamous lifestyle where they don’t belong but are too afraid to confront themselves with the reality because most people still reject the idea of a poly relationship."
sexover30,fr3wche,t3_gmguzf,1589868130.0,"I was the one teaching everyone (well, my girl friends at least) about sex. I was 13. I already knew pretty much everything there is to know. About safety, various contraception methods, clitoral stimulation, the g spot, stds, hygiene, what’s a cervix, what’s a uterus, the different shapes and types of labia, sex itself etc. I have explored myself too. Porn was nothing more than visual stimulation, I have never taken it seriously. 

My mother bought me a book that explained everything since she knew I was entering puberty very early and she wanted to prepare me as well as she could with proper information. And back then there was no such thing as sexual education beyond what we learned in anatomy."

A healthy relationship has everything - mutual respect, attraction, friendship, trust, fun, sex, but also disagreements and misunderstandings because no one is perfect.

You have to remember that in a relationship you are equal partners and you are not supposed to be taking on the role of his mother. You are not responsible for his wellbeing, he is. And he is not responsible for your wellbeing, you are. If he has a drinking problem then it’s up to him to fight it. Of course, support is needed but support does NOT = controlling him and reminding him each time he fails. If you don’t see yourself handling a relationship with an alcoholic - you need to leave for your own sake. He won’t change for you and you can’t change him, again, only he can change himself. It’s also not his responsibility to deal with your anxiety. He’s not causing it, he’s not the reason why you have the disorder, you need to be going to therapy for that, you can’t just blame him for it.

SubSanctuary,fr04w3h,t3_glnhvl,1589783831.0,"1. I knew because I like giving away control. I like to leave the decision making to someone else (Master). I like being dominated in and out of the bedroom. 

2. Being tied up and blindfolded isn’t necessarily a submissive act. It’s an act of the bottom. A Dominant can also enjoy being blindfolded. The difference is who has the control. You can be blindfolded and still controlling the situation or blindfolded and at the mercy of the other. Submission is about control and giving it up. It can involve bottoming, it can involve masochism but it doesn’t have to. I, for example, am a sadomasochistic submissive. I like inflicting pain, an act of topping but not necessarily Dominance. I don’t take away control and am not interested in it. 

3. Of course. A munch is just a social gathering. 

4. Depending on the event, really. A munch is just there to chat. I’ve experienced people talking about their kids, taxes and vacations on munches. A play event is very different and usually has rules of its own written out. No one will ever force you to play and no one will touch you without your consent but expect play oriented people there. 

5. I didn’t? I started playing and living it as soon as I realised I need it. Btw, the majority of kinksters don’t go to munches or events. The majority of people just live it privately.

Have you considered that the dynamic itself and the expectations that come with it can potentially become a huge burden on its own?

Just from my personal experience. In the beginning of it all, my Master was exceptionally stressed and the dynamic just ceased to exist overnight, it seemed. And to me the change was so sudden, I couldn’t cope with it. He was irritable, frustrated, annoyed, trying to sort out a lot of work related issues, followed by some health related issues and then being bombarded from ALL sides, including me being needy and centred on *my* wants and expectations. Of course, I care about him and what he feels but sometimes it’s hard to know what you’re feeling and what the reason for it is, so communication is difficult. It didn’t take 7 weeks but it took a bit for *both* of us to realise that sometimes BDSM just has to go. Sometimes, it’s vanilla that helps two people bond and cope with certain life changes. I let go of the sub/slave in me and hopefully became the pillar of support for my man that he needed. Without the expectations of the BDSM lifestyle and our contract, we are now doing better than ever in a vanilla setting. And now, a month later, the BDSM aspect is slowly making a comeback.

That hole isn’t meant for penetration in the first place and really rather raises the question of “why yes”. She said no and no means no. She doesn’t need any reason whatsoever for it. Maybe she has a mental block, maybe she’s afraid of that pain, maybe there’s a health issue or maybe she just doesn’t want anything in her poophole. Respect that."
BDSMAdvice,fo6eseb,t3_g5yy1x,1587556712.0,"We believe you, he’s an absolute aßface, show him this topic and tell him to gtfo of your life and stop hiding his abusive shit behind the title of a Dominant. What a tool."
AskWomen,fo6aeut,t3_g5wmvj,1587552542.0,"Put multiple glasses of water all around the house. On every surface that can carry a glass of water. Table, coffee table, night stand, work table, couch sides, kitchen counters, hallway, bathroom next to the toilet, next to the bathtub/sink etc. That’ll be a very good reminder that is hard to ignore..."
AskWomen,fo6a7ek,t3_g5mbl5,1587552328.0,"Very easy in my case - suicidal thoughts. They ALWAYS come first, before I even realise another depressive episode is coming. It’s like a tsunami... first, everything is calm, too calm, everything seems in order. Then the first wave of “I’m not good enough, I’m terrible, no one even cares about me (even though I have plenty of people who do care about me!), I am a disappointment, *mind going through all the trauma in my life*, tears, feeling like I’m about to implode and then the main wave comes in and crashes every single reasonable thought that was left in me - I WANT TO DIE, I CANT COPE WITH IT ANYMORE, PLEASE LET ME DIE."
AskWomen,fnzlhfd,t1_fnzkhw1,1587396340.0,"99% (per year btw, not lifetime) isn’t 100% and I happen to be that 1% who had an accidental pregnancy on an otherwise perfectly sitting IUD. And there are many, many more stories like that. Because 1% of 100 may be 1 woman but 1% of a million women is already 10000. And there many millions of women who use those methods, so the numbers are high. And they are high every year. Not to mention that many women can’t have hormones and have to rely on condoms, which are not very reliable or nfp methods, which are only reliable if a woman is very regular. 

I have a feeling that you’re one of those people who will blame women for getting pregnant even if they used precautions😒"
AskWomen,fnzijbs,t1_fnzgz9l,1587394738.0,But you do realise that there is no fool proof contraception method in existence other than removing the reproductive system altogether?
AskWomen,fnzefkb,t3_g4b01n,1587392435.0,I would feel included. Because the only result I will ever hope for is a negative.
relationships,fnw1u5g,t3_g47i7k,1587309709.0,"I have literally not read a single thing in your post that would somehow be in his favour. He lied to his wife, he cheated on her, he lied to you, he cheated on you, he keeps looking for other women and doesn’t involve you with his family. It really reads like you’re not even together..."
cheating_stories,fnuzbwl,t1_fnubt9f,1587275315.0,You wrote the topic as you did and madd the “responses” after I commented. Grow up.
RedditBDSM,fnsza9q,t3_g3kd5o,1587231632.0,"I understand your worries but this is pornography you’re talking about and you do know what else is out there aplenty, right? Child pornography, zoophilia pornography, actual rape, etc. The amount of illegal shit out there is astounding. And they’re not exactly getting away with it but they are. And it’s always been like this. If anything, these days the industry is getting more and more “regulated”. There’s a long way to go but it is what it is. I don’t know those websites but those who do and go there are likely to not really care."
cheating_stories,fnsnwrx,t3_g3m9vb,1587225424.0,"So, talking to any human of the opposite sex instead of you is cheating? Poor boy..."
