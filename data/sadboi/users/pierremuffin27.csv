I’m not emotionally numb, indifferent, or apathetic (like I was with Zoloft). I still have anxiety, but it’s controlled. I feel like I can more easily handle the anxious thoughts/feelings. I feel happier and more motivated. It’s easier to do things that I used to procrastinate due to my anxiety. I haven’t noticed any side effects. I’m not saying it’s a miracle pill and I’m cured, but it’s making my life easier and helping me feel better. If anyone wants more info or has questions about my experience I’m happy to share. :-)"

To get a nice brightly colored smoothie do fruits and veg that are the same color (e.g. peaches + carrots, greens + kiwi, beets + strawberry). Oat milk is great to make it creamy! If you do add greens like kale, spinach, etc. I recommend adding a splash of orange or lemon juice to cut the bitterness."
