I don’t want to hear what she has to say because she ruins things. Having to hear how much she hates who I’m dating or I’m friends with and what she thinks is wrong with them and how annoyed by them she is, etc. I’ve tried telling her everything under the sun to just let me be and let me do me and she refuses to listen to me.

I had to break up with my boyfriend cus they couldn’t get along and she started accusing him of being abusive. I’m back to dating him but didn’t tell my mom. If I try to tell her I know it will be a huge deal. A least a long lecture! I feel like this should all go a different way considering I’m 28.

Showerthoughts,fhhk7ts,t3_f3amgw,1581606063.0,"Quagmire has more of a personality. His creepiness and pervness is more thought out and more intelligent. His jokes are up there and has more of a story arc all around. You've met his family and he legit cares about them all, even his friends. 

The Todd is dim witted, a skilled surgeon, yes, but not much else going up in that head. His only personality trait is pervert. Everyone is disgusted by him and unlike Quagmire, The Todd doesn't actually get laid that often. 

Sure Scrubs would benefit highly from Quagmire being on the show, he would add a lot of better quality jokes and great secondary character arcs but it would change Scrubs quite a lot.

On the other hand, The Todd would ruin any scene he is in on Family Guy. His character is too boring and is too pervy without any other redeeming qualities. No one would want to watch a scene with him in it, it would be God awful. 

They are perfectly placed in their own shows, adding just the right shit to each show. Don't ruin that, please."
AskReddit,fhgf002,t3_f32ywf,1581565431.0,"Not being homeschooled by my high school dropout mom who had too many other people to take care of and no time to actually school me. I wish that when I told the school counselor that I was suicidal and they told my mom, that she would have just gotten me a therapist instead of pulling me out of school. It has seriously hindered 90% of my life. From common knowledge not being common to me, to not having good study habits for college and failing out, to having severe social issues and mental health issues and so on. That one decision that my mom let me choose ended up being the single worst decision of my life. It set the rest of my life up for one hell of an awful experience. I never got my initial treatment for mental health issues that I've been dealing with since I was 12 and when my dad died 4 years later, I went off the deep end. I'm only 28, but I spent ages 18-24 being stuck in my mental illness and stuck on disability. I'm having the worst time overcoming it. I feel like I was robbed of the most important parts of my life growing up that almost everyone had. Sure, I got to spend my teenage years at home in pj's doing whatever the fuck I wanted, but I had NO friends and my education stopped at 7th grade. I spent 6 teenage years watching TV, reading romance novels, gorging on food, talking to strangers online, inappropriately and living in solitude and isolation. I went fucking nuts the moment I got a license and a car. 

Now I'm 80lbs overweight, stuck on disability with no way out, no real work ethic, lack of motivation, anger issues up the wazoo, and any attempt I make at making my situation better always gets fucked up somehow. I can't crawl out of the hole. I keep trying but idk how to do it anymore."

To be fair, he was abusive and it wouldn't have worked out either way... But we were on again, off again for nearly 4 years. I was always close to my best friend and there were several times that it caused us to not talk for long periods of time. One of us always reached out and we went right back to where we were. The whole experience was rather fun in the beginning but it was chaotic in total. It ended over a year ago (the poly and 3some part) and I stopped talking to my bff cus of events surrounding it. 7 months later I left my abusive ex but waited 6 months until I reached out to my bff cus leaving my ex was just as chaotic as being with him and I needed to be more level headed before I sought my bestie out. That was a month ago that I reached out too. We are right back to where we were, but better cus we don't have my ex pinning us against each other. We made a rule not to go back to that whole experience with anyone again. We like it better this way. 😄"

At the worst of it, ""she"" takes over (causing me to black out and not remember anything) and has done things such as stab walls/pillows, throw knives at people, punch people or walls, throw things, break doors and a whole lot more.

I stupidly spent 4 years catering to his every need and he couldn't give me any of the basics. I had to fight for everything with him. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry, paid bills, bought cars, worked, went to college, raised his kids and basically sacrificed so much of my life for him. He wasn't worth my time.

He cheated on me for almost the entirety of the relationship. He lied about everything (and I do mean everything). He used a lot of my family and friends for various things. No one liked him. He seriously downplayed a serious crime he committed. And basically, I found out he just played me because he got free housing, free stuff and his own personal cheerleader. Never again. Seriously.

FreeCompliments,eveypha,t1_eveafdy,1564483529.0,"It's not an easy journey and it didn't just start this year! I've been working towards this for many years. I used to have really bad depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. I attempted suicide at least 3 major times (all 3 should have killed me but somehow didn't) and I was addicted to cutting for 6+ years. I have an eating disorder. I was an alcoholic and drug addict (really it was any drug, anyone was willing to give me... So I took a lot of shit that I have no idea about). And I was in and out of psych wards, crisis centers, etc. Mental health housing (group homes). So I had a lot going on that wasn't very good. I also was in 5 back-to-back abusive relationships for 8 straight years. The 2nd one was the one that kind of started me on this journey in its own way. Basically, I wasn't allowed to cut, attempt suicide, drink, do drugs or participate in my eating disorder as long as I was with this person. So I got sober while being abused. It kind of went from there. And the more positive changes I made in my life (whether I chose it or was forced into it), the more I started thinking clearly and being able to recover from things. This year just happened to be the year that I finally had enough with the abuse and toxicity of things and started buckling down with what I allowed people to do to me. So in a lot of ways, abusive relationships saved me. I started therapy this year as well to further help me recover cus on top of all these things, I also have anger issues which resulted in a split personality. I would not recommend going this route to help you but it's just what my experience was. Therapy is Definitely something I recommend though. That's helped me a lot.

Good luck on your journey! And thank you so much for your kind words!"

I used to value myself based on my appearance but I've come to realize that it's such a small part of what makes a person valuable that I strive more for what internally makes me happy rather than externally. Looks fade over time but your personality is here to stay. 

I am very proud of myself, thanks!!"
FreeCompliments,evetnrr,t1_eve3u0r,1564478567.0,"Thanks 💕 I am overweight by 70 lbs. And while I'm more on the healthier side of overweight, it still causes too many problems for me and my health and it would be better for my overall health to lose weight. I definitely don't have to lose all 70 lbs but I do need to lose at least half that so that I can do more things. It should also help with my fibromyalgia and pain levels."

FreeCompliments,evdpe41,t1_evdc28v,1564444019.0,"Thank you, I really am proud of myself! Most of my journey (so far!) has been learning that I matter just as much as anyone else, if not more so because at the end of the day, I have to live with myself. Learning to stand up for myself cus I don't need to live with someone treating me horribly. A lot of realizing that my thoughts, emotions and needs are important and valid and that I can do stuff for myself and I don't need to put others before myself, especially if it harms me in the process. And as far as body image, it's just knowing that I am beautiful and that I am healthy and that others opinion of me doesn't matter, just my own opinion."
