helpmecope,fqxquuf,t3_gli8wt,1589736463.0,"I feel like there’s a much deeper issue here. If it doesn’t make sense then that’s probably because that feeling is true, the information she is giving you isn’t adding up. It doesn’t make sense. There is something going on with her that she might be hiding from you, and it sounds like she is using this moment against you. As an excuse for her behavior. You mentioned the word manipulative when you described her. I don’t think you’ve done anything truly wrong. I can say getting to know another female on a one on one basis can be walking the line to lead to further temptation no matter how safe or harmless it may seem now. I would not hang out with just her alone moving forward, rather a more appropriate environment would be a group date setting where both of your partners are there. But that’s incredibly beside the point I know. I don’t know man this just sounds messed up I’m sorry for what you’re going through, but I would investigate further what’s going on with her."

It’s all about you and your feelings. Don’t ever let anyone continue to make you feel uncomfortable if you don’t want them to out of politeness. You’ll look back and wish you would’ve stood up for yourself. You’re the only one that will fight for you. You’re not overreacting. It’s about respect. Anyone who tries to downplay your emotions is wrong. I don’t mean to sound harsh but being too polite is what gets you raped. It’s something I have to remind myself of so I can shut down any person that tries to violate my space. You should feel good, safe, and sensual if you are having any sort of intimacy, even cuddling, with somebody. Anyone that doesn’t make you feel good come fuck off. No means no.

But I’m going to start by saying it sounds like this guy has a serious porn addiction and wants your to reenact his fantasies, which is unrealistic and unhealthy. It won’t stop with this request, as you already mentioned you’ve experimented and tried new things which I totally support. It’s going to escalate past this and the more you give in, the more extreme the requests will get. That being said I support being adventurous in a healthy environment. You should feel safe and in control AT ALL TIMES when you are being intimate with your partner. If you feel uncomfortable, your partner should respect you. And back off. 
It’s that simple. 
It’s up to you what you want to do. But let me ask you this. If your best friend or sister was coming to you with the same problem, what would you tell her?? Whatever advice you may think of, take. Take your own advice on what is acceptable to your own body. And side rant- he better be getting you off frequently if not every time. Random I know but your satisfaction is just as important as his. Just something to consider. If you don’t leave him hanging in regard to orgasm, he shouldn’t be leaving you hanging either. I hope you figure it out and love yourself first!!!!!!!!!!"

BipolarReddit,fbergg6,t3_ecx0dy,1576792210.0,"I'm not going to give you advice on whether you should leave or stay. Only you know your relationship.

At the end of the day being with someone like yourself, and like myself, whose mental health is a part of who we are, will influence our relationships whether we like it or not.
I've been with boyfriends who brush me and my flucuating moods to the side, and don't acknowledge my struggles. And I've been with a guy who took care of me and catered to that part of me. It makes such a big difference when you're with someone who works with you on your stuff. Find out what works for you in a partnership, and don't settle for anything less. If he is committed to you, then he will work on learning your patterns and recognizing the signs when your having an episode. He will do his research, work with you, and communicate on how to best help you in those moments. I wish you love and peace."

I don't feel that I've wronged anyone, I'm not a drug addict I've never done anything to anyone I'm related to besides choose my own path in life. Ever since I left the house at 18 it's always been me to reach out or instigate any sort of relationship. My family, and parents especially aren't bad people but it feels like my whole life they cut the cord when I was really young and I've been expected to have my own back with no support. I've never understood why I'm treated differently then the rest of my family. My siblings get financial help and support. I on the other hand struggle with bi polar, BPD, and so forth. Those 2 being my biggest struggle. Is it because I have BPD that everyone always leaves me alone?

Option 1 is courtesy of the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"", and that's to use it as a moment to get freaky and just be like oh my God babe you turn me on so bad so hard. Look at what you do to me.. Now Option 2, which is what I actually do, is try to make a joke of it. Like oh wow that was definitely so hot, oh yeah I just fucking love when fucking physics fuck my vagina over. That was my vagina for the record i swear. Then vigorously suck that d so hard that you both black out the embarassment. Both are very hard to do, but just practice eventually you'll figure it out. Also last pro tip, but crucial. When you are alone, experiment with angles and what angles make you queef. Then learn how to tighten your inside muscles, as you go into that angle to prevent the queef from happening. Sometimes it's unavoidable, most of the time it's not! Try it out girlfriend and good luck!! *Edit: lastly, a boy that can't handle all that the vagina offers is but a small little child. A real man would either laugh it off, or ignore it and  not make you feel ashamed or embarrassed. If any partner you have, leaves a perfectly good vjay over a little air, they are a BITCH BOY.

I could feel people around me but couldn't talk to them. And I couldn't leave that place for much longer than life on Earth. It was lifetimes. What if where you go is worse and this time you are trapped and can't kill yourself out of that shitty existence? I freaked out and called my friend and ended up going to the hospital.

trashy,f1egbef,t3_d8vgnj,1569421571.0,Who TF cares? Mind your business if she wants her buttocks out let her. I don't see a feed calling girls in bathing suits trashy. Like chill and let people wear what they want and let it roll off your shoulders its not killing anyone.
toastme,f18duos,t3_d86ndp,1569256281.0,Sorry for your pain and struggles. Depression feels like an unbeatable boss sometimes. I hope you have more days worth living for!

You can always talk with me however if you need to vent. I am 25 female, have had my fair share of feeling like I'm right on that edge. But you grow. make it to the end of each day and keep on going. Put something yummy and healthy in your tummy it's probably part of why you feel the way you do. Find the days worth being a part of they are close in the future!"

IWantOut,ezuua9u,t3_d2at76,1568160972.0,"Salt lake City for damn sure. Only like 700-1000 for a place of your own downtown or 400 for a cuuute house with roommates. Great weather tons of outdoor shit and people. Very active and green. And very decent price on food and drinks around town. Lots of $6 beer and shot deals. Park city 45 min north with killer ski resorts and nightlife. The Sundance film festival is held there. And zion national park about 3 hours south with amazing camping and hiking. I miss living there. And lots of younger people live.
Also huge lgbqt community! Salt Lake City Pride is insanity. Huge parade and block oarties. Tons of local businesses that represent, defend and support the community!"
helpmecope,ezszp8e,t3_d253zo,1568116667.0,If you have tonsillitis how do you cure it? Surgery? Or can you just take medicine? Also invest in hot tea it will help immensely.
helpmecope,ezszjyn,t3_d253zo,1568116520.0,"Maybe try taking a break from inhaling any vape substance. I have this problem everytime I smoke vapor for a couple days. Regular smoke (although still unhealthy) doesn't give me issues. Otherwise sounds like a variety of things. Could be allergies, your air filter in your place needs to be changed. New pets in the house? Or even asthma. A Dr is the only person that can get you a proper diagnoses but think about anything different that has been introduced to your environment in the past 30 days and yeah I would suggest testing if you are reacting to vaping by quitting for a couple weeks. If it goes away maybe try vaping for a couple days and see if it comes back. If so you know you don't react well to vapor but other than that could be a few different things."
