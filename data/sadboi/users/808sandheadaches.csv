She posts pictures and videos of herself all the time with no edits so why now? I really hope this is isn’t actually edited but it does look like it is
relationship_advice,fio30xa,t3_f8vurp,1582575317.0,"I’m gonna give a probably controversial opinion from his perspective as I did almost the exact same thing your boyfriend did. I was in love with my boyfriend and I would’ve married him. Never thought in a million years I’d cheat. Very out of character for me. Went to a party and got extremely drunk. A guy was extremely pushy with me and I ended up having sex with him. I told my boyfriend straight away and was remorseful. I can’t even begin to tell you how sick I was over what happened. I cannot speak for your boyfriend, but I know I would have never put myself in a situation even reminiscent of that again. 

Personally, I’d give him another chance. Especially if you truly love him. I believe people can make big mistakes like this and learn a lesson. I hate when people say “once a cheater always a cheater” because I do not think that’s even close to being true. People make mistakes. If it was premeditated or over a long period of time and he was hiding it I would say dump him. But It’s up to you to decide if this is something you can work through. If his heart is truly in the right place I think this is something you could get past. Best of luck to you."

xxfitness,fgszcso,t1_fgsy4uq,1581095808.0,Thank you! But you probably don’t want to take nutrition advice from me because I really don’t eat the healthiest. But a typical day of eating would be a vegetarian sausage biscuit with egg and cheese. 1 or 2 pieces of peanut butter toast with honey if I’m still hungry. I usually drink a big protein shake after my workout and lunch is something like rice with beans and vegetables. Dinner is usually half a box of pasta with olive oil and seasonings and 2 tilapia fillets. I snack on a ton of chips and cookies throughout the week as well lol. I’ve eaten this way consistently for about 5 months except for when I’m on my period and struggle with my appetite. Like I said don’t take nutrition advice from me. I work out a lot but I can also eat a LOT and have a huge appetite.
xxfitness,fgsvi6t,t1_fgsboyl,1581093517.0,"A typical quad focused leg day for me is hip thrusts, leg press or heel elevated goblet squats and walking lunges. A hamstring focused day is usually hip thrusts, leg press, weighted hypertensions and RDLs or lying hamstring curls."
xxfitness,fgst4ko,t1_fgsruat,1581092103.0,Thanks girl! I’d definitely qualify this as a bulk but I didn’t really intend for it to be one. I plan on lowering my calories a little in the spring to lean out a bit for the summer. As far as exercise levels I lift weights 4x a week for 1.5 hours and do an hour of hot yoga 1-3x a week. Walking my dog is the only “cardio” I do.
xxfitness,fgsr4yq,t1_fgsfrw1,1581090884.0,I’m on a 4 day split. Glutes/quads. Back and shoulders. Glutes/hamstrings. Chest and arms. I sprinkle in some yoga as well.

xxfitness,fgrxd71,t1_fgrw2il,1581061298.0,"Honestly I just took it day by day and did what felt right. I wasn’t necessarily focused on pushing more weight, it just kinda happened that way. Some days 215 felt like 500 and others it felt light. I really only used 45lb plates. I’d imagine progressive overload is the way to go though."
xxfitness,fgrurva,t1_fgru570,1581058335.0,"I definitely did add a little thickness to my waist during this, but I think it’s pretty proportional to the rest of my body. Muscle speeds up your metabolism and you are able to burn more calories while at rest. I also practice yoga which really focuses on core strength."
xxfitness,fgrrq1p,t1_fgrrl9r,1581055262.0,Definitely not. I actually prefer the smith machine because it keeps the bar moving in a straight line as opposed to a barbell where you can get a little sloppy with your movements
xxfitness,fgrrj3s,t1_fgrqwsl,1581055095.0,I wasn’t doing any squats or deadlifts as I only had access to a small apartment gym when I started. The “squeezing” at the top of the hip thrust is really what changed the game for my glutes so maybe try that with you squats and deadlifts. I’m not sure if it qualifies as a compound lift but I’ve found that a close stance with you legs at a 90 degree angle will really burn your quads whereas having your legs further out at a more obtuse angle will burn the hamstrings.
xxfitness,fgrqrg0,t1_fgrpxts,1581054402.0,Thank you! All I can say is lift heavy and feed those muscles! I was so worried about gaining weight when I started but quickly realized that muscle growth requires a lot of calories
xxfitness,fgrqmnp,t1_fgrqe5h,1581054281.0,No cardio but I do hot yoga 1-3 times a week
xxfitness,fgrqhm4,t1_fgrq2jp,1581054153.0,You can kinda see my setup in the first pic in the background. Basically place a bench about a foot or so away from a smith machine and lower the bar down. You want the bar to be resting on your lap sort of where your hip bones are (I use a folded up mat for cushioning) and your shoulder blades should be resting on the bench. You can use this same technique with a barbell or dumbbells.
