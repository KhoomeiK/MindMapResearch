TheOA,foxpox1,t3_ga2exk,1588151898.0,"Season 1 offered a better ending to the series than season 2 in my opinion. There were many unanswered questions but you could project many interpretations about what was going on, and it was an open ending that left room for your imagination. Season 2 clarifies what is happening, whether we should trust the OA or not and whether it's more a psychological drama or a sci fi show. Depending on what was your favourite interpretation, you may be happy with this clarification or a bit frustrated. I'll be honest, I wanted the show to go another direction... and yet season 2 was still awesome.

However it leaves even more unanswered questions than season 1 and the ending of the season makes you hope and believe that the cancellation announcement is fake. The ending of season 2 offers a conclusion to the series that is less satisfying than the ending of season 1 but I'd still advise to watch it, because it's beautiful."

It wasn't perfect but I liked it a lot. True, he secondary characters didn't have much to do once again. It would have been much more interesting if the Doctor remained a normal Gallifreyan Time Lord and if the Master had been the kid experimented on but I was so caught up in the episode I didn't mind that much while watching (now it really annoys me). There were plot holes within the episode concerning the companions' escape but the dilemna the Doctor was facing made me not focus on that.

But seriously. The Doctor let other people sacrifice themselves for her to escape, once again. She was there, being taunted about becoming death, about becoming like the Master, and seemed to doubt her plan but she let a poor guy kill himself and take all life on Gallifrey with him? The genocide was fine as long as she did not push the button herself? Throughout this season, so many characters have died for nothing. The Doctor doesn't care about people and about life anymore. I thought she still did a little when she made her speech about sacrifice but nope.

I'm not interested in seeing her trying to find her home planet or chasing the Master and his cyber crew. I want the show to address what a cold coward she has become.

At some point I thought the companions would just leave the Doctor to get back to their own lives - especially Yaz - but the companions' frustrations have been dropped during the last two episodes.

I'd really like it though. The relationship between the Doctor and the companions isn't great, the relationships between the companions themselves are not too developed, the adventures they've lived with the Doctor were not particularly marvellous this season (always on Earth, either in terrible futures when human life was on the brink of being destroyed or in important past events where the companions didn't know who the historical figures were), the companions rarely have much to do, and we've seen they are missing out on their own life and are saddened by it.

He's got a whole collection of plushie mice, but some of them are to play fetch with, while some others have to be grabbed by the nose so he can chase the mouse's tail. If you don't use them correctly, he'll just stop playing and look at you until you figure it out. He does a similar things if you send one of the fetch mice somewhere he doesn't consider fun. If you do so, he lays down and looks at you with contempt, so you know you have to get that mouse yourself and send it somewhere better.

They are getting disconnected from their own world, and by extension from their friends and families. I hope it becomes a subplot. It would be cool if one or several of the companions decided to stop following the Doctor because of this.  


I'm thinking about Yaz in particular. She's becoming estranged from her family. She's putting her career on hold, which was mentioned in this week's episode. She's there staying with people she has no real connection with: the Doctor keeps secrets and Yaz is clearly annoyed at that, and her relationship with the Doctor, with Graham and with Ryan just doesn't develop despite all this time travelling together. There's no spark between her and the other characters. I hope that at some point, she's going to decide to go back to her own life.

I'm also thinking about Ryan to some extent. There are often seduction scenes between him and secondary characters. Maybe at some point he'd like to have a meaningful romantic relationship with someone. Travelling with the Doctor doesn't give him space to do that.

I see Graham sticking longer because he doesn't seem as frustrated with the Doctor hiding stuff and because I feel like after his wife passed being with the Doctor, Yaz and Ryan gives him purpose. But I also think that if Ryan decided to go back to his normal, earthian life, Graham would follow him.

For the first time in the series reboot I don't see what makes the companions stay with the Doctor. She doesn't trust them with her personal stories, she doesn't particularly seem to care about them, and even the travelling doesn't seem too rewarding. The companions never have much to do, the places they visit are never marvellous, and they don't forge meaningful connections with people."

The oxygen supply of the cannister was limited, with a smaller crew not composed of people absolutely unfit to be there like for instance a kid or an old lady, they would have had more oxygen supply. Why was the Doctor affected by the lack of oxygen? Why was there fire everywhere in the tunnels despite the lack of oxygen? 

Lots of other facepalm moments in this episode too. Hopefully the next episodes will be better!"
doctorwho,ff2qk5w,t1_ff2jfns,1579519513.0,Yep. The new Doctor's personality and behaviour reminds me a lot of Tennant's Doctor and the new Master reminds me of Simm too.

NetflixSexEducation,feyokj0,t3_eqx853,1579448350.0,"Maeve and Otis's storylines in season 2 are too distinct and individually rich and interesting for Isaac to be a mere plot device to keep these two apart, in my opinion. Actually I don't really see them getting together, maybe becoming friends again but not necessarily more.

Maeve's story is about how tough she appears but how lonely and hurt she is, how abused she's been and still is, how her life is a struggle, and how she goes through all the tough stuff thrown at her, how she gets abandoned and mistreated by almost everyone around her. Otis abandons her and publicly humiliates her this season. Isaac manipulates her and appears to be trying to isolate her even more.

We indeed barely know anything about Isaac - even the memories he tells of his childhood are questitonable because he lies a lot. What we do know is how he treats Maeve, how he spies on her through his window, how he pushes things to enter her life, and what we do know is the point Maeve reaches at the end of the season: her mother and her sister have been taken away, her relationship with Otis is in a terrible state, and Isaac is there severing her ties with people around her. What she has left now is school, Aimee, the quiz group and the group of girls she was in detention with. Both the quiz group and the detention were linked to Ms Sands, who will maybe help Maeve a lot in the future. However I believe Isaac is going to try to take all this from Maeve as to be the only one for her.

I don't think Maeve's story is about her finding a romantic or sexual partner at the moment. I think it's about learning to love herself, finding real friends she can trust and managing to improve her life thanks to her hard work at school. She sort of got there at the end of season 2. Even her relationship with her mother improved little by little. But Isaac's actions and manipulations brought her to even more misery, and I see him as a serious antagonist to Maeve.

This arc goes way beyond being a simple love triangle."
NetflixSexEducation,fexsoel,t3_eqlu8q,1579435537.0,"I don't read it as a simple jealousy issue. How he interfered in Maeve's relationship with her mother was also, in my opinion, out of line. What he told her at the place where AA meetings were set, how he spied on her mother and told Maeve about her not going to work, agreeing on searching the flat... This part of the plot is particularly well made I believe because on the one hand we've got Maeve's mother who possesses drugs and who admits having used again once. There is the whole history with Maeve, and now there is a new child at risk. And on the other hand Isaac played a role on tensing up the relationship between Maeve and her mom, on leading her mom on the path to using again and on making Maeve decide to call social services right away without at least having a talk with her mother first. It's a very complicated situation, and Maeve's choice seems both very hard and legitimate.

However Isaac's role in having Maeve's mother taken away and him erasing Otis's voicemail at the end really leave me with the thought that he might be trying to isolate Maeve and to be the only person for her. I get narcissistic perversion vibes from his actions."
ptsd,fen029g,t3_epxmx0,1579273930.0,"I feel the same. How can they go on with their lives, fulfill their projects, gather with friends, advance in their career while I'm here living like a recluse, having anxiety attacks, being unable to work and leaving my bed only because I've got a cat to feed? It is incredibly unfair. I hate them so much and I hate this society, where I'll never find justice and where this type of situation is going to happen to others as well as to me again. I've lost all hope of things improving."

It actually helped me a lot to keep it to myself: my job was another world where I was not a victim, where I didn't suffer from trauma, where I was confident. I felt like shit out of the office but I was able to pretend to be okay there and it made my days so much more bearable. I decided to talk about it at some point for reasons and I won't go into details but it was a terrible mistake that impacted tremendously my ability to work."

polyamory,fehai28,t3_ep51g0,1579112546.0,"It seems to me that the core of the problem might be the lack of intimacy you have with your boyfriend, don't you think? The lack of sex between the two of you and witnessing that he had sex with his other partner plus not having one on one time with him while he spent time with his other girlfriend only may hurt you because you see him do things you would like him to do with you too? Also if he spent your next date texting her instead of being with you while the previous weekend was so hard on you, it's really understandable that you got hurt.  


How is your relationship with him outside of this weekend? Also, had you already met his girlfriend and did your boyfriend and you discuss that he might get intimate with her while you're also staying at her place beforehand?  


I still don't really know if I'm poly or not. It is a type of relationship I find beautiful and I hope to go back to this style of dating someday, but right now I'm at a time when I needed to go back to an exclusive relationship. When I was in poly relationships it was awesome because I love how fluid feelings can be, how good it feels to be honest with myself and to embrace loving multiple people, and how free it made me to accept that my partners could love several people and that them liking someone else didn't take anything from me. At the same time it was sometimes hard because I had lots of insecurities and I used to be a very jealous person, which were things I had to work on. I was able to feel compersion when my partners were honest with me and when I felt secure in our relationships. With some partners, it wasn't that easy: there would be a lack of clarity, a lack of stability that would make me insecure. In these cases I wasn't able to feel compersion because I simply didn't know where I stood for my partner. I don't like to feel like that so these relationships didn't last."
polyamory,feh7hdz,t3_ep1pxv,1579110744.0,"The title of this post is that you don't like his partner, but you don't actually say anything about her. It seems to me that it's your husband's behaviour that you don't like, and the fact that him dating someone else changes your relationship. And unless she did something horrible to you and is one of your worst enemies, I don't see why you not liking her should prevent your husband from dating her.

Anyway your problems with your husband'ss behaviour is something you need to discuss with him in order to try to reach a point where you are all comfortable. I say ""all"" and not ""both"" because his new girlfriend is a person too and she may not want the same things you do. For instance you want full transparency; maybe your husband and/or his girlfriend prefer to have privacy. You're not alone in this relationship, your husband is a different person than you are, and his girlfriend too, you have to learn to deal with it, to learn to trust your husband, and to work on your insecurities. Honestly from reading your post the worst thing to me is how you don't seem to consider these people as individuals."
AmItheAsshole,feftxza,t3_eoxqu2,1579065105.0,"YTA, why did you have to be hurtful when you could just have left it at ""yes I'm pretty busy at the moment, maybe we can catch up another time?"". 

I also don't get why you passed the opportunity to meet up with him at least once. Worst case scenario, you don't spend a good evening and don't see him again afterwards. But maybe he could have become your friend too. Maybe he could have introduced you to his other friends afterwards. And you'd have met people in another setting than your job. 

By the way, it's not always the best idea to be friends with your colleagues, depending on your area of work maybe. Be careful about that too..."
ptsd,fefgqh8,t1_fefepsz,1579055973.0,"Exactly this. If I forgot what happened to me, I would forget who my abusers are, I would forget what I now know about their various profiles, and I would become too trusting again. I suffer a lot and I'd like to be able to manage my fears and to have normal relationships, but I don't want to forget how horrible people can be and I don't want to lose what I learned. It would put me in more danger again, it would all happen again. And honestly, seeing my life and how I've been raised... there would be a LOT of memories to suppress..."

Pets,fdl7h32,t3_elt3c4,1578518346.0,"My cat destroys everything. He scratches the couch, my mattress, my books, he chews on chairs, on electric wires, on my bicycle's seat.... Because of him there's a lot of my furniture that has become very ugly and that I'd like to change. But what's the point? He'd destroy the new stuff anyway. As long as he's here, I'm keeping my ugly furniture. He helps me become more tidy, as I can't go anywhere without tidying up first, or else he'll chew on important stuff. Oh and I've arranged my furniture in a weird way and kept an open wardrobe I can't use anymore (as he scratched my clothes) to provide him with high spots and with hiding spots. I live in my cat's flat.

My favourite destruction story was once, I was laying on my convertible sofa which was in bed mode. My cat goes underneath, I don't mind. I hear some scratching, I don't think much of it. He scratches the arms of the sofa all the time and I actually let him do so. And well I finally needed to leave and had to put my sofa back in couch mode. However, there was no sign of my cat under the couch. Only little pieces of foam on the ground. After a moment I noticed a hole under the couch's seat. Finally, my cat let his little head out of this hole: he had dug himself a burrow in my sofa, and he was in the seat!

I laughed a lot and I've accepted that using my sofa in bed mode was not a possibility anymore."

DarK,fbt6ug6,t1_fbt5ppi,1577069882.0,"When Michael reads the letter Jonas shows him, he understands it is his own suicide note even though he was not planning on committing suicide. If we believe the characters keep some free will, things could go different ways here. Michael could decide this world is too absurd, that he suffered too much as a child, and decide to save young Mikkel, not write the letter, not kill himself. However Jonas would not exist. Michael decides to write the letter. He sacrifices himself, both as an adult and as a kid, so that Jonas would exist. Jonas then brings Mikkel back in time because Michael himself chose for it to be done, knowing very well all the hardships he had to face.

That is, I believe, the significance of this letter. A man sacrificing himself and a younger version of himself, who could suffer less, for his son. 

This scene adds a lot to Mikkel and Jonas's tragedy."
