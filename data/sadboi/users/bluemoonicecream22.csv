AskWomen,fmne6o7,t3_fvzp3y,1586224040.0,"Was in a very intimate relationship for 4 months. The last two months of it were some of the most stressful months of my life. So many things one after the other happening. I was irritable and more insecure during this time. He broke up with me just this March 27th. Said we weren’t compatible and even though he liked me he couldn’t deal with the fights. It is sad because we had amazing chemistry and a few weeks before he was gushing about me to his friend and he also wore my body wash to work to think of me all day. Then we had a big fight, next week I spent the weekend there and it was amazing. But apparently the big fight was the last straw and I couldn’t convince him that I was learning to cope better with the stress. Apparently I wasn’t enough to give me a little to learn how to manage the new stress."

And it’s probably pretty rare. The cases of this that happen are extremely sad and should be a reminder to us all to have some human interaction for our own sakes (and hopefully non-surface level interaction) and to help others. I don’t mean to belittle those who are this extremely isolated and lonely. I have depression and paranoia and I can try to imagine how someone may want to or are almost forced into isolation through mental illness or societal judgements. I am now encouraged to check up on my friends and past connections more than I have before.
unpopularopinion,fk3aulu,t1_fk394zd,1583824610.0,"Someone will notice. There is a line that Jonathan says in Buffy the Vampire Slayer to his “friend” when the friend tells him that the people in high school he thinks about never think of him. Jonathan responds that he still cares about them even if they never think of him. It’s beautiful and sad all wrapped into one. 
You have people out there that think about you and you don’t even know it. And you also think of others that don’t think of you and you leaving may impact them in ways they don’t understand, but will be emptier or changed when you’re gone. I think of not seeing my favorite gas station clerk when I moved away. I may look up a classmate from high school to see what they are doing- see they have cancer- and get sad and contemplate things in my life, etc. Even now, here I am being impacted by YOU. You matter, you influence others, you can fight even more to positively influence more people."

I finally told her I barely spent time there (lie) and she talked to me again and then when I broke up with him and got with someone else I continue to talk to her. Been dating my current Bf for 2 years 8 months now and sleeping over a lot for first year or so and then after actually moved in together. I try to lie and hide that I live with him. If she ever finds out (inevitably she will) I know she will cut ties again- most likely permanently this time. I need therapy to learn how to handle this. She has other issues I’ve dealt with through my childhood and adolescence. But I love her even still. It will be extremely painful to not have one of my parents due to her being religious/conservative. Like she doesn’t love me more than that premarital sex rule. Try to get therapy and prepare yourself for the worst. If you expect it to go well it may shock you. Sorry for the sad advice and story.
