Dogs need mental stimulation, very long walks will create a marathon runner not a tired dog. Another good option, only for supervised out of the crate use, is a wobbler treat dispensing toy, but they can be kinda loud depending on how hard your dog smacks it around lol."

The ortho I saw was an orthopedic surgeon so if I want to work on conservative treatment I need to find, not a surgeon I guess? That is if I decide I don’t want to go through with the surgery. I’ll start by researching conservative management and seeing if I can get another referral to a podiatrist."

We got it all figured out and then they realized that it was out of stock/on back order everywhere. So I left with ten 1mLs instead. So maybe the Envision thing had been added on back then. There was a different pharmacist working today. I think she was only frustrated because of how busy they were and the fact that she’d had to refill it twice because I asked about adding my new insurance on then went back to not using it. I didn’t realize adding my new insurance would be I was back to a single 1mL. As long as I don’t get a bill I’m good, I paid the price I expected so I’m happy with that...

gardening,fjdu86u,t1_fjdt738,1583259351.0,"I’m thinking I should just go ahead with it now before anything grows and leave the stump! That way nothing gets trampled or disturbed.

I’m sure I could find something interesting to do with it, even if I don’t it already looks pretty cool. Thanks!"
gardening,fjds4hj,t1_fjde3j4,1583258177.0,I was thinking about this too. They’re actually all full sun plants as far as I know. Most of the area around the tree already gets some amount of direct sun throughout the day. The tree leans to one side so it’s fullest foliage is more off to the side rather than right above the trunk.
gardening,fjdrwqe,t1_fjd25bl,1583258057.0,Thanks! I just don’t know how I could dig them up when they haven’t even started to grow yet this year? Would that require waiting for them to start growing in? Personally I am fine with leaving the stump so I might just go with that. My landscaper suggested removing it but I’m not sure why exactly. The tree is half dead and the roots are also disrupting the site of soon to be installed stone patio.
ChronicPain,fjahnib,t1_fj9yyjo,1583173691.0,"Thank you! This is super helpful and clear. I think I’ve also been having nerve issues since my most recent severe sprain. I’m starting to get weird numbness/tingling/shooting pains. I guess for me the worst that could happen after surgery is being totally unable to walk, but I feel like the chances of that happening are super low. I already have chronic pain and severe instability. I have to wear a stiff lace up brace at all times to avoid spraining my ankle, even with it on I have to be really careful when I want because quick turns and side to side movements are giving me shooting pains. And I have still sprained my ankle stepping out of bed or the shower when I couldn’t be wearing the brace :/"
ChronicPain,fj9tq87,t1_fj9s0ej,1583159365.0,"He seems confident in the success of the surgery, but not with the necessity I guess? He said many people just live with it and wear a brace. That if I am not an athlete it’s not super necessary. Maybe I wasn’t clear enough with him about how active my job (and hopefully someday career) and lifestyle are. I would have significantly lowered functioning following the surgery while I recover which is the biggest con. But thinking long term I would probably benefit a lot. He is a foot and ankle ortho surgeon, I don’t know about the sports medicine stuff though. He seemed glad to go ahead with it after seeing the MRI results he just said he couldn’t decide for me and wouldn’t really push me one way or the other... I don’t do well with big decisions lol. I’ve talked to my family about it now and they seem to think I should do it."

ChronicPain,fj3zujn,t1_fj3n736,1582997016.0,"Yeah I was pretty pissed that I had to do PT before I could get an MRI. Didn’t make sense to me at all. I guess his reasoning was, either PT helps and you get better, or it doesn’t help and you get an MRI and consider surgery."

ChronicPain,fi56n9m,t1_fi2u1is,1582156111.0,Yeah I feel like I need to. I will probably go see a podiatrist because I’m also having numbness in different parts of both feet. I just feel like without the MRI I will not have any way of knowing what’s really going on and he didn’t even want to do one.
ChronicPain,fi1vfjb,t1_fi0y29s,1582065586.0,"Thanks, this is well put. I do fear that surgery could make it worse and I’d be unable to do my job anymore, which requires being on my feet and walking for 7-8 hours a day. I also love hiking and backpacking, which is not easy on the ankles but it’s what I like to do... my ankle sounds similar, always at least a little swollen, hurts to touch at several points, hurts to go through the full range of motion. But it’s better than having no range of motion. I will see what doctor says after MRI comes back. I am looking at ligament shortening, not bone fusions. If I were looking at fusion surgery I would not even be considering it at this point because that is pretty much guaranteed to affect mobility. From what I’ve read and heard from my doctor about ligament surgery ideally it would just remove some of the hyper mobility so that the risk of injury is lower.

I am just tired of being told nothing can be done. It is frustrating. I am sure most everyone here knows that feeling. I would like to think that something can be done to help this. I am only 25 and I’ve been dealing with this since I was 20. Sure I can function now, most of the time, but i am always waiting for the next injury that will put me out for a while."
ChronicPain,fi0uzg7,t1_fi0uivt,1582045313.0,"That is true. I mostly want to decrease the frequency of re-injury. When I get new sprains I am unable to be active for weeks while recovering. I just feel like if there is any chance of having less pain, and less new injuries, I should pursue it. I also think I will have to wait and see what MRI results are to make a decision."
ChronicPain,fi0ukhv,t1_fi0taxw,1582045073.0,"Thanks id never heard of the 30/30/30 thing. I am just not sure what all the variables are for me. I am still young, but that makes me worried that it’ll just keep getting worse and surgery will become inevitable. The I’ll have a harder time recovering from a surgery when I’m older. If I didn’t spend so much time being active my pain would probably not be as bad, but being less active does not seem like a long term option for me. I’ve gone through periods of lowered activity to try to recover and it doesn’t last. But I would hate to get surgery and have it go badly and lose the ability to be active. At least right now I can do most things, except when recovering from my all too frequent acute re-injuries."
TalkTherapy,fhgdtjq,t3_f31w83,1581564592.0,"I’ve been through it. My therapist did it via text and refused to have a final/termination session. He also used the phrase “higher level of care” a lot. It really sucked.

HealthInsurance,fhe3wgg,t1_fhdrtoh,1581512938.0,"There is nothing that indicates they are out of network. I looked for that because I have no out of network coverage.

HealthInsurance,fhcxr0c,t1_fhcvdws,1581473075.0,I will call tomorrow and see what is going on. Just freaking out slightly so hoping someone has ideas. The fact that it has happened with two different providers has me confused. They are also providers that required referrals from PCP so maybe I somehow messed up by not sending referral directly to insurance company? I gave the referrals to the providers I assumed they would know what to do with them. :/

Veterinary,fh2d5ea,t3_f13nn0,1581247093.0,"I am not a vet. Behaviorally, newly adopted or fostered dogs should go through the two week shut down, where they are kept only at home and away from new animals, with limited exposure to new people and situations. This gives them time to adjust to the new handler, routine, and environment. This two week (behavioral) quarantine also gives them time to be monitored for any signs of contagious disease/URIs/etc.  I cannot imagine that a dog being fostered would thrive or be able to decompress being kept in a kennel at a vet from day one, this could greatly add to their stress especially if they were pulled from a shelter environment. If the staff is not able to arrange for someone to go to their home to take the dog out, then maybe fostering is not the best idea for them. That’s just my opinion."

I’d really prefer to see a woman or someone younger but I’ll take what I can get if it comes down to it. 

The insurance I had before was great, so I didn’t expect this at all. I had really good out of network coverage too so I could go anywhere and be reimbursed."

TalkTherapy,fgiv5o0,t1_fgih7jc,1580831600.0,"I just switched to this insurance in December and it’s my first time being off my parent’s insurance, where I had been on the same plan my whole life until now. So figuring it out has been hard. The therapist knows this. I talked about my uncertainty with getting this figured out. Then we talked about it again when I asked what was going on with it, and still have heard nothing from them over the last three weeks unless I initiated the contact. 

I also switched from an extremely good out of network coverage, and no referrals needed plan to a HMO. Zero out of network coverage and referrals for everything. The therapist is on my insurance’s provider list. But if for some reason my referral wasn’t properly done or whatever I am pretty sure they could still deny coverage, because I went there before the referral was in place. Also the place I’m going for physical therapy was initially denied coverage for being “out of network” even though they’re on my insurance’s provider list. So I don’t have a huge amount of faith in this online directory lol. 

My employer covers 100% of my high deductible, but it has to be approved as in network. I’ve already had lab services I had to pay out of pocket because my PCP is in network and the lab, in the same office, is not. I should’ve verified that ahead of time but I figured if my PCP is in network his lab would be too... ugh

Thanks for the advice it’s really helpful! Navigating health insurance is so confusing which is why I was really hoping they’d help out more like my other providers have done so far."
TalkTherapy,fgigkga,t1_fgif8xi,1580820967.0,Yeah I don’t know if it’s really worth trying to make it work at this point. They never reached out to me or said anything. When I asked what was going on with insurance they just said they didn’t know.

But if you are feeling guilt about daily use maybe it’s a good time to take a short break to think about things, clear any guilt you might be feeling, take a step back. That being said there is no reason to feel guilt about smoking daily if it works for you. It is likely just internalized guilt from society stigmatizing cannabis use."
BPD,felyrfv,t3_epldwt,1579234400.0,Oh I know that feeling. The weird failed attempt bounce back. Then feeling dumb for attempting at all cause you feel so great now that it must’ve not been *that bad*. Weird near death experience euphoria from a near death experience you constructed by yourself. Such a weird thing.
AskDocs,felxui3,t1_fekjy8p,1579233684.0,"My ankle is really loose and just chronically hurts. I have seen orthos, they just say they can’t do much of anything. I was told to keep wearing the brace with activity. I have done PT for Achilles tendinitis on the same side, and I still do those exercises to prevent it from coming back. Which includes calf raises and stretches. And daily ice and compression. I don’t usually do much balance stuff tho so I’ll add that in. Right now I can only do calf raises while standing on both feet. I used to do them standing on one leg at a time, which I guess uses balance, but the injured side can’t handle that right now. It always hurts and I roll it a lot it, it doesn’t usually swell like this."
TalkTherapy,felxf5u,t1_fekcaav,1579233365.0,"I am sure there are plenty of therapists willing to work with those things. They just either don’t have availability or aren’t in my insurance network... I just don’t have time to keep waiting to find the right person I need help now, ya know? It feels like it only gets worse with each failed therapy attempt. I can’t afford to pay for much out of pocket."
AskDocs,felx9b4,t1_fek3lbp,1579233245.0,"My initial injuries came from skateboarding years ago! My ankle is now “loose” from being sprained so much which is why I keep spraining it, but this most recent one is the worst I’ve had in a long time, possibly ever."
AskDocs,fek0fqo,t1_fek035c,1579189944.0,Yeah I use a brace daily. I was already using it before the injury because of past injuries making my ankle loose. The one time I walked outside without it I sprained my ankle lol. I just wasn’t sure if I was doing something wrong with treating it or if the persistent swelling meant something else was wrong. Keeping off it isn’t really an option if I want to keep my job so hopefully it goes away eventually.
TalkTherapy,fejlkg4,t1_fej34n3,1579179001.0,I know you’re right. But then I’ll just be stuck without a therapist again :( I’m scared of what will happen if I keep going without treatment. I don’t think I’ll ever find someone who is a good fit and willing to see me. Everywhere else I’ve called has put me on a wait list. I’m starting to look at places that are 45+ minutes from my house because nobody can see me. And I live 5 minutes from a major city.
TalkTherapy,fejlf25,t1_feiyc2a,1579178856.0,It has already happened before. It happened in November.
careerguidance,feibaun,t1_fei8529,1579134490.0,Unplanned absences without a note from a doctor. This is my first job with PTO so I didn’t know how it worked.
careerguidance,fehzri2,t1_fehzd7s,1579127185.0,Ah ok. I just wasn’t aware. I feel like not having the PTO to use could easily mean my future request for days off will be denied so that sucks
careerguidance,fehzo35,t1_fehz6wv,1579127129.0,I thought that only applied to unexcused absences
TalkTherapy,feh8r9b,t3_ep0dwi,1579111489.0,My therapist went through pros and cons with me. He also hospitalized me. If you say you are seriously considering it they legally have to hospitalize you.
medical,fefteez,t3_eov6n0,1579064633.0,"You should taper. I know that is hard because it’s sold as a six pack, you’ll buy it and want to drink them all maybe start by pouring one out before you even start drinking so you won’t have to fight yourself to not drink one after having five. I personally prefer SMART meetings to AA but you should look into attending one of those for a while, or even doing an addiction IOP."
CasualConversation,fefp3ga,t1_fef5eb4,1579061289.0,"If they actually did it at the end of the day, and not every 4-5 days, I wouldn’t mind. I have talked to them about it multiple times. I just don’t want to talk to them about it again cause I’ve done it so many times, I don’t want to be annoying or seem uptight."
CasualConversation,fefox7t,t1_fef4u6y,1579061170.0,Sorry I didn’t know that existed I will our future dishwasher complaints there
bipolar,fecibp8,t3_eocdjh,1578974608.0,You sound a bit scattered but this is all highly relatable to me. Im sorry things are rough right now.
TalkTherapy,febi6u3,t3_eo67ih,1578959087.0,I would be really hurt if someone said this to me because I’ve always been hard on myself for being sad despite having a “great” life. (It’s not amazing but compared to some it’s a great life) I always feel like I should be happy for what I have and the fact that I am still depressed means I’m a piece of shit
TalkTherapy,fe5vcue,t3_en7ovm,1578875783.0,"For me it was boring. It’s a good distraction and time filler. Repetitive information that I’d mostly already learned in therapy or on my own. It is a good way to have structure and something to do during the day if you are lacking that. It’s a good way to be consistently monitored. I despise group therapy so that wasn’t great for me. I’ve done some that are mostly educational and one that was more process based in addition to the education. I’ve never been able to open up
I’m group therapy so I didn’t benefit from the processing bit at all."

AskDocs,fe5ocjo,t1_fe5kh6p,1578872102.0,"Yeah, urgent care doc I saw said I should see a podiatrist. Guess I’m going back to the PCP for another referral... just saw ortho last week. I also have numb toes on my other foot and ortho said he can’t help with that, I need to see a neurologist. Maybe a podiatrist could help with the numb toes as well though? I’m just gonna get my feet removed they’re causing too many problems lol. 

Knowing that I also have numbness, even though it’s in the other foot, could peripheral neuropathy be a possible cause of pain localized to one toe? That was what the ortho said a potential cause was for the numbness."
Petioles,fdvh6jp,t3_en2hrg,1578747405.0,"Invest in the pax dry herb vape if you have the money, it’s pretty awesome. Not as convenient as carts but next best thing maybe. You got this tho, it’s always hard to quit at first. Start by just cutting out the carts I think that’s most important right now, especially if you’re not getting them from a trusted source. Shit is dangerous."
