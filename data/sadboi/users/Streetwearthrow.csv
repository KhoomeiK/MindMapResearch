I'll launch a game on my PC when I'm bored but within a few minutes I'm just as bored as I would be without it. When I know it's all I'll have for months or years, Civ 5 or CS-GO or whatever I'm watching on netflix at the moment suddenly feels suffocating, asinine, and pointless. It doesn't help that every single piece of media out there just serves to remind you of when things were normal and okay. And I miss my boyfriend, god I miss my boyfriend. It feels like a cruel joke to have moved several hundred kilometres back home to my parent's house, a five minute drive away from him, only to not even know when I'll be able to see him again. At this point I've resigned myself to not feeling any sort of joy until at least there's a vaccine, and even after that, I'm going to try not to get my hopes up, experience has taught me not to."
