painting,fng1lus,t1_fnfzx02,1586920199.0,"Honestly, what helped me was just putting those first few lines down and telling myself ‚ÄúI can do this‚Äù. I also spaced out my painting with 1-2 hr sessions and played some of my favourite music to help me out. I used to try to paint something in a single session and always ended up frustrated with my work and it‚Äôs flaws - ultimately giving up and not touching it again. Taking breaks in between let me think about how I want to paint the rest and what to fix. It was nice seeing the progression day by day, so when I would go to bed after a painting session I was excited about doing it the next day and told myself I‚Äôm proud for painting more that day. Sounds silly, but this all helped me out...now I have the urge to paint more and more :)"

geologycareers,f6kwawf,t3_drsexx,1572922319.0,"Western University has a nice program, it‚Äôs mostly mining and planetary based! Great faculty and research opportunities too. I‚Äôm sure you could combine it with a double major in business. I know some people in the industry that did their undergrad here in geology and then their MBA afterwards, so that‚Äôs always a cool option. 

Edit: As for student life, I‚Äôve had the best time of my life here after I switched from Med Sci into Earth Sci in second year. It‚Äôs a small program in terms of numbers of students but that makes it fun, you get to meet everyone and know the professors personally - easy for networking. Oh and we have a fun Outcrop Club where we run different events for students (field trips, destressor nights, game nights, formal dance, rock sales, etc.)"
