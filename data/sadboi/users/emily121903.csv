LandoftheLustrous,flnn79e,t3_fi20p6,1585322083.0,Im a sucker for character suffering and pain. Almost all the series I like are the same kind of sad and tragic
LandoftheLustrous,flm4or3,t1_fl3au7k,1585274502.0,"It's very much a play on our reality and society but with animals. Personally, these anthropomorphic animals are very much relatable to our everyday lives and I felt myself connecting with them despite the obvious difference. I really recommend it! It's a great show and really pulls at the heart strings at times. It's unique too. Just give the first episode a try and see where it goes."
LucidDreaming,flas40t,t1_fl9vclm,1584990009.0,Exactly! I have a hard time calming down so most techniques barely work so :( I'm gonna try again though
lonely,fjkiswi,t3_fdt2q1,1583427642.0,Happy birthday!
lonely,fjblwzk,t1_fjavcky,1583196265.0,genius
lonely,fjascgg,t3_fc1knf,1583179661.0,I feel you deeply. Even reading that I got sick. Do..people really live like that?
SuicideWatch,fg2emzg,t3_ewcap5,1580443551.0,Please seek a hospital. There's still hope out there in this world. I hope you're okay and still here with us.
SuicideWatch,fg2ee86,t3_ewhlj8,1580443425.0,"Because it's not the way to go. You may believe that you will suffer forever but with time, you can heal. But the sad part is life won't always be happy and perfect. You will still have sad days but eventually, it will get easier. Seek help my friend, don't let it consume you. ♥️"
SuicideWatch,fg2e39p,t3_ewarqm,1580443262.0,"I wish I could say a definitive yes but it's all based off of what path you choose. You can either let the darkness consume you or fight it, hold on. It won't get better instantly but with time, you'll eventually heal. They always say time is the best medicine. My advice is to seek help and think positive. I know death seems like the only way out but it's not. There's hope. Hope never goes away."
SuicideWatch,fg2drw5,t1_fg0b6oe,1580443093.0,I have the same method. I'm constantly holding on just to see a new content like a chapter update or amazing series.
depression,feak3bl,t1_feaj31q,1578949764.0,I meant they like them better
homestuck,faawl0o,t3_e7mosi,1575914523.0,"Good dog, best friend!"
SuicideWatch,f80f3f8,t3_dy49lr,1574127528.0,hello good friend
depression,f6wvxa0,t3_dtex60,1573236088.0,"I've been off sertraline for a bit since I can't refill at the moment but from my experience, it takes a WHILE to kick in?? I swear it took half a year for me to notice an improvement and even then it wasn't enough. But who knows I took like 25 mg which is what? The lowest dose?"
depression,f6wvpq4,t3_dt7c3q,1573235950.0,"Yeah. It's hard to believe people. Ive always wondered how people thought of me and I wonder if people even like me at all. Did I talk too much? Am I being annoying? Should I apologize? I moved away from the bestest friends I've had but I feel like they will just forget me. I won't even be a memory. The best thing we can hope is that it's not that. While honesty is preferred, it's painful."
depression,f6wviav,t3_dtdktj,1573235815.0,"Oh tell me about it. Even tho i haven't had very good dreams lately, I've had some great ones. I felt loved and I was held by others. I keep dreaming of people that don't exist but I loved them and they loved me. I hate waking up because i have to face that they aren't real. That it isn't my life. No one loves me like that. It's sad but you aren't alone."
depression,f6wv8na,t3_dt3zps,1573235641.0,"You're not alone. I have a hard time connecting with others let alone have the guts to start a conversation. I mean, what is there to say? What if I mess up? I don't really have close friends and the only person I talk to (online) disappeared on me. All I can tell you is keep going. Try to put yourself out there and meet others. Go to events of your interests and make a goal to say hi. Don't expect people to come to you because that rarely happens. Even if the first people you talk to don't work, be proud you tried and you'll be more confident to try again. I believe you'll find friends someday. :) Just need a little encouragement"
LandoftheLustrous,f5634d5,t3_dkiznu,1572017858.0,I would like someone to actually CARE about phos but we all know that ain't happening
depression,f4taaj6,t1_f4quph9,1571785887.0,"Sorry, I've never had to deal with loss before so I don't fully understand it. I know that grief doesn't go away but it gets easier with time. Loneliness however is a bit different. You assume that if you're lonely, go talk to people but it's not that simple. Although I do understand where you're coming from since grief is an incredible horrible feeling."
depression,f4pve7s,t1_f4p482i,1571743547.0,"I realize that in a way, they don't mean what they do. Many people are good I like to believe and while accountable for their actions, they couldn't control it. That's why I sympathize with most criminals since I understand what led them to it or what caused these things. I think it's just the way people are born that affects everything.

People are good, I've seen many good things that make me happy. When I came back from the hospital, my teachers left messages and my friend's parents gave me a gift. My health teacher was even gonna send flowers if there weren't for a winter storm. It felt strange since I felt like the most invisible person out there but the fact people know who I am keeps me happy. Even small greetings are enough. Although that can't change loneliness, I still don't think I've lost faith in people just yet."
depression,f4pujty,t1_f4p2vaa,1571743139.0,Grief tends to have more reason than loneliness though and goes by faster. You won't always grieve as much your whole life like loneliness. Loneliness should be something quickly solved especially in such a connected time but it's not.
depression,f4ova4z,t1_f4oozz7,1571709212.0,"For me, shipping gives me hope and for some reason I feel less alone. In a way, it's similar to how you watch someone else to be happy. :) I hope you find other things that make you smile in life."
depression,f4oci23,t3_dl56jh,1571699423.0,"Same here. I had it real bad last year, especially last semester. I didn't even want to wake up and go to school anymore. I was so miserable and I ended up failing two classes ((like full fs and all)). I wish I could give advice as I'm still working on it but I would try to do a little at a time. Don't procrastinate but take it at your own pace. Work on fixing your mental health to help gain back motivation."
depression,f4obu1o,t3_dl19jj,1571699211.0,I'm sure we can all do it :)
depression,f4obpma,t1_f4nq3t6,1571699143.0,Oh same!! Ive always had pleasant dreams that are worth staying for. Not as frequent anymore but I would have these happy dreams where I'm not so single and sad. :)
depression,f4objwk,t3_dl0h6i,1571699044.0,"It's the same thing for me too. I have so many things that are months in advanced I'd like to see which I guess is keeping me alive. 
Any reason is worth it if it helps you stay."
Rabbits,f2zr5kc,t1_f2yshsg,1570535750.0,He seems normal this morning. My main worry is he's such a fast eater.
Rabbits,f2ysbxq,t1_f2ys2sv,1570497273.0,Yeah he seems just fine. Attacked me when I gave him some pellets and stuffed his face in the measuring cup before I could pour it.
Rabbits,f2ys2sv,t1_f2yrre4,1570497092.0,He's laying down with his head a little up but it doesn't look like it's because he's trying to breath better and more like minor discomfort.
Rabbits,f2yrjtt,t1_f2yqg8t,1570496729.0,"He acted the same with food as usual pretty much. The main thing off is that he seems a little worn out and nervous but that's to be expected after what happened. I'll keep watching and hopefully he's fine by morning. If not, I'll call a vet."
Rabbits,f2yq734,t1_f2ypiay,1570495804.0,His behavior is a little strange. I keep hearing mouthing noises like he's drooling.
Rabbits,f2m6sj5,t1_f2ls21i,1570302405.0,"I'm making sure they will and if they don't, i will go there myself with buses. For now, should i monitor him and see if it changes once he gets his hay back or bring him to a vet?"
Rabbits,ezx0h29,t1_ezwo50a,1568229276.0,1/4 cup pellets and 2 cups of greens everyday. And unlimited hay of course.
Rabbits,ey8aysk,t1_ey6h3ql,1566915819.0,Nope! His nose might sometimes be a little wet underneath but I think it's cause he dunks his whole face when he drinks water.
Rabbits,ey69b85,t1_ey65sqz,1566850345.0,Yep! That sounds like it. He looks like he's ready to move. He usually does this around the same time of day too.
Rabbits,ey698d5,t1_ey65n55,1566850294.0,As far as I know yes. He's been even more active lately so hopefully it is.
Rabbits,ewohlrr,t1_ewlj22w,1565618202.0,"Of course, he was rejected. However we were able to prescribe a medicine on the phone (due to a financial issue we couldn't see the vet). They're sending the prescription so Hopefully baytril works!! We're gonna wait until he's fully healed before attempting to neuter him again."
Rabbits,ewleds8,t1_ewldqhx,1565520107.0,"Is a respiratory infection too sick? He sneezes sometimes, has minor clear discharge, and behaves the same. The only bad thing is his wheezes but he breaths fine other than that."
Rabbits,ewgqfs4,t1_ewgfyht,1565387935.0,Ive been cleaning his nose. He does flop but he's been hunched in a corner sometimes. He sometimes clicks his teeth during his rests but it's hard to tell if it's pain or content.
depression,evs0had,t3_ckwgss,1564724802.0,Yes. I once didn't do homework for a whole semester before suddenly doing all of it at once near the end. And I mean ALL of it. I really wish I could provide you advice but I still haven't figured out how to fix it. I could really use motivation daily :(
depression,evs0d6v,t1_evrrhhc,1564724679.0,"Same! And heres the hypocritical part about my mom, she HAS depression too so uhm?? MOm shouldn't you understand me too??"
depression,evs085w,t3_ckmvf8,1564724526.0,Same! I think of everything i want to say before hand but i never say anything about emotions during the visit. To the point i have to write things down because I can't seem to physically say it??
Rabbits,evn5ft5,t1_evn4675,1564619039.0,https://m.goodrx.com/sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim?dosage=200mg-40mg-5ml&form=oral-suspension&label_override=sulfamethoxazole+%2F+trimethoprim&quantity=20 is the one I'm currently looking at. It looks like the same pink stuff he usually has but it might be wrong.
Rabbits,evd1vl2,t1_evc1hc9,1564428262.0,"Haven't heard him wheeze in days now. Although his lips is still wet, i assume that's from the bowl since he likes to make a mess. He doesn't do the big flop on the back anymore, just littler ones. I always assumed that the big one was used so often because he would breathe the worst at the time. I think it was his attempt to breathe better."
Rabbits,evbliua,t1_ev7t2rb,1564382369.0,For the first time he took the whole dose voluntarily without restraint! I just put applesauce and oats on the tip and he starts drinking. I think he's starting to realize what he's supposed to do.
Rabbits,ev6xc6c,t1_ev35ftg,1564252517.0,"I will be attempting that method as well. However, i mixed it with apple sauce, oats, and the medicine. He licked it all up on a plate so I think I found our method. Its more direct and he doesn't miss anything. I think he's stopped wheezing as much too."
Rabbits,ev6x2kq,t1_ev4q9wm,1564252424.0,I do provide daily amounts of hay. He doesn't normally eat droppings so he mightve been curious to try it? I'm not sure but it isn't a habit of his.
Rabbits,ev2x6rz,t3_ciaee9,1564185289.0,He doesn't jump much he just jerks his head away a lot. He isn't a fan of a syringe in his mouth.
Rabbits,ev2vruh,t1_ev0r9sz,1564184575.0,They recommend that I give it to him in his mouth and that the food isn't very effective. It did work the first time so I have to try forcing it again
Rabbits,ev2tt9p,t1_ev0r9sz,1564183593.0,"My rabbit isn't producing anymore discharge it seems. If he is, it's coming out clear and watery."
Rabbits,euzv1yi,t1_euxgian,1564126911.0,What if the discharge is white? I don't know if there's a difference but it's worth asking. My rabbit sadly hasn't been doing better so i will call when they open and see what they recommend we do.
Rabbits,euxc6iq,t1_euvosi7,1564085837.0,He didn't have discharge at the visit so he wasn't checked. I worry if hes consuming the medicine correctly since it did look like it could spill. I'm gonna try a few more things before I'll call with the vet.
Rabbits,eupb8bo,t3_ch556y,1563954334.0,Older picture but he looks the same
Rabbits,eup9qpg,t1_eumr68o,1563953673.0,Also. How do I know which size onesie or shirt to get? Will my rabbit struggle to use the litter box in it?
Rabbits,eun6ekm,t1_eumr68o,1563924826.0,The date is set for after he runs out of the medication prescribed. So he should be healthy by then if all goes well. I'll look into the post and pre operative instructions as we get closer since it isn't for another 2 weeks.
Rabbits,eumpmym,t1_eumoo9z,1563918863.0,Although his fur feels a bit rough in some places. I think he's shedding but I don't know if it's normal
Rabbits,eumoo9z,t1_eukmd7j,1563918491.0,I think so. Definitely has more energy and quieter wheezes. Although we won't be able to know until a bit more time.
Rabbits,euj9a3o,t1_eufquxr,1563865725.0,I don't think it's blood as it likely would've gotten on his paws. He is wheezing but not as bad as before the medication. He usually gives this kinda big bottles wheeze occasionally or little small mouse sounds when he sleeps.
depression,euj6yf4,t3_cgjvw9,1563863988.0,"Even before I was suicidal, I could never imagine myself living a long life. Hell, I even drew up a picture of myself getting shot to death and carried by angels when i was like what 6? 7? Personality, I can't imagine a life past 30. I can see myself getting married, having kids and then just..that's it. I never pictured a future where I'll grow old. I've always felt like I'mma die young.

Just know that you're not alone in feeling this way."
depression,euj6rgh,t1_eui3d2w,1563863852.0,Yeah. Ever since i was young i had dissociative issues. Like.. elementary young.
Rabbits,euf37i0,t1_euettsy,1563761264.0,I put it in a piece that's shaped like a taco shell and he seems to fall for it. I will probably try raisins as well if he likes them.
Rabbits,euetnt7,t1_euczbi5,1563753629.0,I tricked him by putting it on a piece of lettuce. Will it still be consumed the same and work?
Rabbits,eucyckc,t1_eucwqnx,1563691969.0,Will do! Also i was wrong he did wheeze a little bit just now but he's mostly wheezeless. It just will take time for it all to heal.
Rabbits,eucwajo,t1_eucvs8r,1563689395.0,"It only took an hour so hopefully it gets easier with time. 

I haven't noticed any wheezing so far and he seems to be feeling better lately. He's been having a lot of energy but still naps a lot. He doesn't seem mad at me or scared after I try to handle him so it seems our bond is strong. I hope he gets well soon."
Rabbits,eucqn83,t1_euc0zwh,1563683289.0,"Will do. I'm making progress with him. He's taking more each day! Im training him to think medicine=yummies by offering treats during each part. Today I would say he took most besides a drop or two spilling but that's okay. I think he's like me where if you push something too far back on the tongue, they react. I don't know if rabbits have a gag reflex but I do think my rabbit isn't used to having something on his tongue."
Rabbits,eucqmpz,t1_eucp0y1,1563683276.0,Oh thank God. That means his heart rate is normal.
Rabbits,eubucj2,t1_eua7o16,1563657237.0,"That's what I'm trying to do. I learned that the first few times I did it, it got on the chin it seems. Only now I'm noticing that he's actually licking and moving his mouth. I know how to do it, it's just I can't kept his head still. Everytime I bring the syringe to his mouth, he jerks his head back. I'd love to have the vet show us again. However, we have no way of getting there or any money leftover."
Rabbits,eua7obx,t1_eua7nfa,1563604584.0,I think anyways. He was licking it afterwards and it didn't look like it was spat out.
Rabbits,eua7nfa,t1_eua7axl,1563604552.0,"I wish i could go back to the vet but it's likely I'll be charged again and i don't have that kind of money. I've figured out how to feed it to him, it's just getting him to stay still. I successfully fed him 1/2 day but he's still making the pained sounds."
Rabbits,eua3y2h,t1_eua2wch,1563600155.0,I had to do that because he moves too much. I don't want to hurt him.
Rabbits,eua2s84,t1_eua2j35,1563598917.0,Its likely because he didn't take his full medication. Poor guy has been refusing it for the last 3 hours.
Rabbits,eua2hwq,t3_cfhzjm,1563598623.0,It might be some sort of grunt or honk. He's doing this while sleeping
Rabbits,eua2a7q,t1_eua231j,1563598402.0,You can do that? Like inside the steam? Greens are about the only thing he will eat so that'd be worth trying.
Rabbits,eua01c2,t1_eu9z57f,1563596173.0,My rabbit associates a towel with being picked up. He avoids it at all time and if I try to make a burrito he runs away.
Rabbits,eu9t69b,t1_eu9qx88,1563590075.0,Alright. How do I know if he swallowed it or if it's in his mouth properly? The method im using doesn't let me see his mouth very well.
Rabbits,eu9qgaj,t1_eu9pul5,1563587799.0,Is there anything besides applesauce and banana that could be mixed? I wanna try to make it more easy for him
Rabbits,eu9q4co,t1_eu8c5r0,1563587525.0,It would be so much easier if he knew how important it is for them. 😔 My rabbit is lucky and still fusses over one mL
Rabbits,eu9oxmq,t1_eu8busb,1563586568.0,That's what I've been having as well. I can't really pick him up so I have to hold him on the floor instead and try to see the mouth.
Rabbits,eu9outr,t1_eu7owu8,1563586507.0,"Its hard to catch him. It makes him so scared. Last time i tried, he was breathing loudly. I think I'm just gonna hold him and get on the floor to see his mouth. It seems to work best. I'm gonna try putting stuff on the nub to help. Could mixing it into the liquid also work?"
Rabbits,eu71rjl,t1_eu70a49,1563515204.0,Is it possible he inhaled it instead? I can't tell what a choking rabbit looks like and I wanna make sure I'm not hurting him.
Rabbits,eu705lt,t1_eu701bl,1563513804.0,"I do believe the medication is working for him. The first night, he didn't wheeze until the morning when his next dose was due. I just think we failed to give it to him properly."
Rabbits,eu6zs83,t1_eu6zd5m,1563513489.0,"I'm not quite sure if my rabbit likes bananas. I offered him some and he ignored it 😅

Also, hes currently wheezing again. I feel like I should at least give him a tiny bit of his medicine to relax since he can't have the next dose until 9 more hours. Or should I wait? Because like before, he wasn't acting lethargic or depressed. He's still active but he's definitely uncomfortable."
Rabbits,eu6yxj8,t1_eu6xsvu,1563512773.0,By providing treats. Do I wait for him to finish or give it the syringe while he'd eating?
Rabbits,eu4ajjo,t1_eu3zwan,1563446676.0,That could work. I will definitely try it since we opted for a cheap dollar store bowl.
Rabbits,eu3pxuj,t1_eu3f2qm,1563421641.0,Yes the vet recommended it as well. I wanted another opinion. Hopefully I can postpone the appointment and he can be neutered in another week.
Rabbits,eu04lfc,t1_eu039ee,1563341694.0,Yeah I think he's fine. He just started mischief and ran around my room. Destroyed a cardboard box and ate some of it for fun. It's likely he wore himself out as he doesn't do that when he's in his space. Only when I opened it and let him go crazy. I'll make sure to update on his condition as soon as possible.
Rabbits,eu02q62,t1_eu01f2a,1563340821.0,"He's starting moving again. My boy's a fighter so he could make it. I don't think it has to do with heat as my room isn't very hot. He might've overexerted himself after running around so much. I'll keep an eye on him and if he does it again, I can try to bring him in."
Rabbits,etzzykv,t1_ety2c9z,1563339599.0,"My rabbit is like that too! When we first cut his nails, he stayed still and let us clip them. Meanwhile my dog runs away and squirms. 😂"
Rabbits,etw32x9,t1_etw1xt5,1563252247.0,Yes. I've done my research and even called to make sure he's in good hands. They said that they have many staff who handle rabbits well.
Rabbits,etw2yo3,t1_etw2bc7,1563252134.0,"It seems that he's unable to groom his paws. It hasn't even come out during the small butt baths we do to clean his behind. Even after cleaning his litter box permanently, it seems stained even on the front paws."
Rabbits,etw1n82,t1_etw1f18,1563250904.0,Its been happening for a bit lately. He's done it his whole life but the past few weeks it's more pained than relaxing. He seems to get up just fine. Hopefully the vet figures out what's wrong and treats him asap.
Rabbits,etq8j04,t1_etq6rby,1563075933.0,He's 3 years old.
Rabbits,etme8ib,t1_etmcz48,1562957944.0,"So the not eating was a false alarm on my part. He ate his greens later. However, i can tell that the cecotropes are too soft and that his bum is a bit hard for him to reach. I made the mistake of buying alfalfa pellets. He just ran out so he's officially getting the correct Timothy based ones and will be having a diet of mostly fresh greens. I provide unlimited Timothy hay for him as well. I do believe it's his diet of pellets is effecting his poopy butt problems. Thank you so much! I will be providing another bath to remove it again as well as schedule an appointment with a vet."
Rabbits,etmc7tv,t1_etm8166,1562956686.0,"It's alright. I'm attempting all of it currently. Hes just hard to handle. Everytime I clean the poopy bottom, it gets messy again. He most definitely will be seeing a vet and having a diet change in the coming week. Thank you for all the advice. Hes my first pet rabbit so I want to make sure I'm caring for him correctly."
Rabbits,etkxx7i,t1_etkslep,1562912739.0,Could it wait a week or two or is it somewhat urgent? I don't know how serious this is. He's still moving and eating so I don't think it's the worst it could be.
Rabbits,etkruv1,t1_etkr2kx,1562906542.0,Its a lot damp but that's mostly under the nose and near the mouth. He does drink out of a bowl so his mouth is usually damp. I can't really tell if it looks like discharge since his nose naturally has whitish brown yellow spots around the nostrils. It looks okay though. If anything it's likely a minor breathing issue but I will have him see the vet soon.
Rabbits,ethmofj,t3_cbrdut,1562820174.0,Can't tell if any of that made any sense. I'm just worried about my bun loaf
Rabbits,ethkrw7,t1_eth9ful,1562818450.0,He does enjoy head rubs. I don't know if he'd be scared of our home since he's been here his whole life. The environment he's in he's been adjusted to for a while I think?? I don't know
Rabbits,esb85xa,t1_esb7r73,1561781330.0,I don't think it's cecotropes as most of the droppings looks like the regular stuff. I heard cecotropes looks like raspberries and these are nothing of the sort. Even bunched up they look like normal stray poops.
Rabbits,es8dgd0,t1_es8a8lo,1561694294.0,Recently I've been fixing up his diet. I give him 1/4-1/2 of pellets with 1/2-1 cup of lettuce. He has only Timothy hay daily. I do think he's consuming too much pellets so I'm trying to reduce it.
