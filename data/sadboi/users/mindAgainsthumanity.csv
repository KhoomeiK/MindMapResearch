JUSTNOMIL,fhfi5rq,t1_fhfczwf,1581543853.0,That's what I chose!!!! I chose it because I love blue and I wanted my fiance and I to save money for our honeymoon and first home.
unpopularopinion,fhenm3a,t1_fhe9ci5,1581526146.0,"Anyone recall Jerry Sandusky? Just read what happen to everyone at Penn State who heard, knew about, or even witnessed his grossly inappropriate behavior with young boys. Graham Spanier, Joe Paterno...disgraced. (Molestation, exposure, grooming, pedophilia, etc...) Failure to report the abuse of a minor is EVERYONE'S JOB. Correct me if I'm wrong about the legal issue, but I'm pretty sure you have to be cold and heartless NOT to say something."
FemaleDatingStrategy,ffv39mq,t1_ffu0zlz,1580254666.0,This...explains everything
FemaleDatingStrategy,ffqmvq2,t1_ffpv9v8,1580138803.0,"My boyfriend did this to me a lot. Now I do one-on-one's with him to re-teach him how to do laundry, dishes, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom etc. His mom gave up on it because she had no patience when him and his brother gave her a hard time. 

 If we get married, I get sick, or am on vacation, he needs to know how to take care of the household duties. Also, you cant use the excuse anymore of not knowing how to properly wash clothes in the washer-dryer. You ruin my clothes- you buy me new ones! Theres no excuse for it when I even put directions in the laundry room. I use them too. If my brothers can do their own, so can he."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fb617x2,t1_fb1gww3,1576538853.0,Sadly mine too. This makes me cry.
Eloping,fakpkvg,t3_e90j5m,1576171039.0,"This is my exact plan!! I wanted the big wedding and craziness years ago, but after having attended quite a few weddings, no thank you. 

It's sad when I hear my friends talk about how much they spent on their big day only to hear how disappointed they were with the food, planning, rentals, venues and yes even guests. Also, they POSTPONE their honeymoon because they cant afford it after spending tens of thousands to please OTHERS! 

I'll pass. I'll save mine and my future husband money for a very romantic and intimate elopement and honeymoon. Call me selfish but a wedding is one day; a marriage is way more than that"
Nanny,f8tqfq9,t3_e21h5o,1574809046.0,"I haaaaaaatttteee that. Yes you are getting paid to still be there, but when you could be doing a million other things (that are time sensitive and are Currently increasing your anxiety), it really makes no sense. Sometimes I wonder if MBs and DBs do it because they're really oblivious to the nanny's needs."
insaneparents,f856qo0,t3_dyzm1s,1574268810.0,"Hi, fellow ED soldier here. My mom is TOXIC as f*** and has been since I was young. I'm 32f and she still makes comments about my size, weight, figure, regardless of whether I've lost or gained weight. Oh and she's from a no- nonsense German family. 

The comment your mom said about wanting to be lighter than you sets off tornado sirens. Ditch the scale (go Office Space and take a bat to it). Scales are the enemy. Every therapist, psychiatrist, and nutritionist has told me not to have one. If your therapy team tells you otherwise, then follow their lead. 

Mother-daughter  relationships are so tough and she seems like, despite the distance, she has a way of getting  into your head. I'm really sorry you are going through this. It's tough to set up boundaries but the more vague you are about weight and specifically numbers you can be, the better. She may give you backlash, but it will be worth it. 

I really hope this helps."
BipolarReddit,f7oayaa,t3_dx5mls,1573924316.0,Wow I really appreciate this. I have a really hard time trying to explain simple concepts to my employer as well as my fellow co-workers and even my own employees. Usually I too use elaborate analogies and thus sound incredibly inept. Thank you for these resources!
Nanny,f7hozrx,t3_dwacnl,1573744879.0,"As a nanny for several years, I can completely feel your pain. That sounds miserable. I wouldn't be able to make it another day. 

I had a simillar job around this time last year with a ND who was EXTREMELY overbearing with his two NK. He worked from home and it caused so much confusion in terms of discipline, when they could ""visit"" and not visit, when to be quiet, when they could be inside or out... etc. Try explaining that to a 2 yr old! It became a power struggle really fast. This person sounds like they are a helicopter parent in training. Nightmare. 

Have you been able to effectively communicate with the NPs? If you can, I'd say something about feeling overwhelmed and wanting to create a routine more. However, I can see that might be difficult because the NK is so young. 

If you do stay on the career path as a nanny, stay firm in working for a family where both parents work outside of the home. You will be able to have a better relationship with the parents, kids, and honestly your sanity!"
BipolarReddit,f6x5b8x,t3_dtem9k,1573242286.0,This is exactly how I've been feeling this whole week. Thank you for posting this. I too have started to cry.
