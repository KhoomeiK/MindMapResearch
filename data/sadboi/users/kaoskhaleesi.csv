Seeing your partner turned on by just you existing and enjoying themselves with you can be a difficult thing to master especially considering y'all are HS sweethearts. Perhaps making an adjustment to foreplay would be beneficial. I understand not really minding if you receive foreplay but that could possibly be some of the problem, in and of itself.

For me, there's something about putting on a show when I'm going down on my partner that turns, not just him, but me on too. Enthusiastically performing oral can be the difference between mind blowing sex and the same old grind. Voice things that you wouldn't mind being surprised upon you.

Yall have been together a long time as well and maybe a sex therapist, or even couples counseling, could help restore the fervor you're looking for. Counseling isn't just for when things are horribly wrong in a relationship."

His words can only harm if your actions prove them true. It's natural to want to get him to stop.

You can allow his smear campaign to continue and those who know you best will ask you questions about it. Those who don't, yall didn't really need anyway.

As for your friend's empathy, she may be more empathetic than others but we are all capable of it. Empathy is a skill to hone based off of your own core values and beliefs.

MaladaptiveDreaming,fc6sacm,t3_eggn6r,1577488203.0,"Daydreaming has been a big part of my life. I started daydreaming heavily in my preteen years. Sometimes to the point my schoolwork would slip right through my procrastinating fingers and my grades would suffer.

There was a lot going on at the time. My former step-father's mother passed away. His and my mother's relationship started to get mentally abusive. My parents were fresh off divorce. I was bored as hell. Daydreaming gave me something to do and also... A coping mechanism.

High school, I met my ex boyfriend and we proceeded for 12 years through an entirely abusive relationship with him the abuser and myself the victim. My daydreaming only became more persistent as I desperately clung to some form of happiness to deny what was going on and that I was most likely depressed. Needed help depressed. My fear of him held me for a long time.

My life has significantly changed for the better and it's taken acknowledging these things about my life, understanding that it wasn't normal, and being okay with that to finally stop daydreaming uncontrollably.

Mindfulness meditation, my support system, and my therapist have all been successful tools for me. Now, every time I daydream, it causes me to think about why instead. What am I worried about? Who do I need to discuss something with? Am I nervous? If the answer to all those questions are no, I keep going. Most of the time there's a yes in there somewhere.

I use daydreaming as a coping mechanism. I try to stop it as soon as possible, leave fun ones for when I'm actually dreaming.

I had the same problem growing up. I distinctly remember daydreaming around the same age you did.

I was quite an anxious teen. I'm 32 now and only just figured out what maladaptive daydreaming was and what I used it for.

A coping mechanism to escape everything that was going on at the time. Mindfulness meditation (coupled with counseling but I understand hesitancy to speak to a parent about these things) helped me go from daydreaming daily to only doing it when I'm trying to figure something out.

Try to figure out what causes you to daydream. If the problem seems bigger than yourself, do your best to ask for help from a trusted adult, whether that be one of your parents, an aunt/uncle, or a teacher.

For the sake of speculation, let's say you get the girl. You still have a lot of work to do to establish a healthy relationship with her. If you're this obsessed in your thoughts of her already, how would this manifest? Life isn't like the romance movies, you don't just get the girl and happily ever after happens. A relationship is hard fucking work and it never ends. You have to want what's best for you and them.

You both need your own social lives, jobs, hobbies, etc. Stand on your own before considering someone else. Yes, ya'll can have some common ground but spending every waking moment together can turn toxic fast if you end up unintentionally isolating her and yourself. Been there, done that for 12 years.

I'm sure you're pretty confident you can keep this mindset of yours hidden from her but I'm telling you, it'll get exhausting and you will, most likely, do something you will regret for the rest of your life.

All jobs are valid. It isn't your fault that they can't see that because you're taking a path less traveled due to the difficulties of receiving recognition. You should be proud of this accomplishment and if they are anything but supportive, they can find out instead of being told and wonder why you don't recognize their praise if they even praise you."
abusiverelationships,f86n0hx,t1_f86m7gy,1574302169.0,"I appreciate it. It's been 6 years since that day and I can't complain. He did some damage but luckily I've powered through the anxiety that relationship caused.

I try to think of my anxiety as a friend trying to tell me something is or was wrong when certain things happen. I started counseling 6mos back and they've helped me process a lot. Things aren't perfect and won't ever be but I have worked very hard to get to a new normal, set boundaries, and follow my intuition.


I'm doing okay. I hope you are too."

It sounds like this isn't the first time, nor will it be the last, OP's boyfriend has been abused like this. Until her boyfriend gets fed up with this problem, nothing will change. If this was a friend of his, would he continue to tolerate what's going on?"
