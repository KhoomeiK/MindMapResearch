depression,fkiurq7,t3_fiqxvw,1584229123.0,"I have struggled with hygiene & self-care a lot throughout my depression. At the moment I'm decently consistent with it. One technique I find myself using a lot (I think I read this tip online somewhere) - I negotiate to just do the first step of a task. Baby steps, if you will. Like in the mornings, I wake up and need to pee, so I go to the bathroom. Then since I'm already in there, I'll say to myself, ""Okay, now I'm just going to brush my teeth. I don't have to do anything else and it will only take a couple minutes."" Then after that, I notice how nice it feels to have clean teeth. Then I negotiate the next step. I realize I need a shower because I stink & it's been a couple days. ""Alright, well I know I don't have the energy for a full shower, I can at least turn on the hot water and stand under it, that might feel good."" Then once I'm in there, I continue each task by telling myself ""just one more thing and it'll be over"", etc.

It feels exhausting at the time, but then afterwards I acknowledge how great I feel now that I'm clean and refreshed. Then I find a way to reward myself for doing a very important task, like for example I love tea so I'll make a cup. Oh and I like to buy bar soaps that smell really amazing, so that's kind of a reward for washing, too. If that is the only thing I get accomplished that day, that's great! I'll thank myself for taking the time to care for my body.

The combo of mindfulness, appreciating small things, & breaking things down into very simple steps has helped me a lot; maybe it will for you, too. I know all this might sound silly or overly simplistic to a non-depressed person, but really I understand your pain. I used to go weeks without showering. I had to re-train myself slowly, some days will be harder than others. But it's mostly habit now, though I still feel that resistance inside sometimes and slip some days.

Every day is another chance to try again! Go easy on yourself. Look into CBT therapy, if you can find it for free/low-cost near you. Things CAN get better & I hope they do. <3"

depression,fizsc01,t3_faluc3,1582872720.0,"I can relate a lot to this. I'm also terrified of the reality of waking up one day in my 40's or 50's and still feeling this way, knowing if I don't get proper treatment for this, it will be my future.

From observation, a major issue I've noted that depression thrives on is rumination over the past and the future, never living in the present moment. Because that is where that carefree mindset is found, when you're grounded in the present and doing what you enjoy. It's much easier to be in that adventure mode when you're younger, before you know how hard life is. I miss it, too.

I wish I could say analyzing all this helps. Depression makes me feel like I'm really great at analyzing things, but my brain forgets it is sick, tricks me into thinking I can think my way out of illness, makes all sorts of negative conclusions about reality. It's really interesting to observe how subtle mental illness can be, how well it disguises itself, how it becomes your new filter on viewing life without you even noticing until you're absolutely miserable.

I'm not starting a family or moving up any traditional life ladders, either, and I have to accept that that's OK. I'd rather be a kid at heart and not live up to what society's standards are on what I'm 'supposed' to be doing with my life. Now to just find a way to get back in touch with said kid at heart, that's the real struggle. 

Dunno where I'm going with all this exactly, but I hope it helps that you are not alone in the struggle. There is still time, every day is a new chance. We can fight this."

If you have an iPhone, I'd recommend putting social media apps in their own folder and moving them to the farthest right home page so you don't easily see them anymore, plus disabling badge notifications & only getting messages in your notification center/lock screen. Idk how that works on Android, maybe there's a similar function. Just a tidbit for what has personally helped me stop checking things so often. Best of luck!"

Psychonaut,fibi9ed,t1_fi9j8dd,1582322518.0,"Sure. The police knocked and claimed they were looking for a man who had multiple warrants out for his arrest. They mistakenly thought he lived at my address, didn't believe me when I told them I had no idea who the person was, so they forced a brief room-by-room search through the house. I tried to stand my ground and told them they did not have permission to search with no warrant, but they pushed past me and claimed they had reasonable suspicion to search due to smelling marijuana. They later came back with a full search warrant and conducted a SWAT-style raid, guns and all. I was charged with three felony accounts after they found my stashes of mushrooms, LSD, & cannabis.

To this day I'm not sure whether the initial reason they came to my house was truthful, and I just had bad luck, or if they just made up an excuse to search, but I'll never know. I lived in a small town in the southern US, where the cops are always bored and aggressive. I just wish I'd gotten rid of all my drugs before it was too late; stupid mistake on my part. My record's clean now, at least."

(But I could never stomach eating flesh again, it grosses me out.) 

Literally everyone I care about, everyone around me, every stranger I meet eats animals, so it makes my choices feel insignificant. It is a lot of energy to care about something that others don‚Äôt give a crap about and sometimes even actively make fun of you for it. It feels hopeless at times and I wonder why I bother. 

But then, when I‚Äôm online I see protests, forums, and other cities where there are lots of vegans, and I see mainstream US restaurants slowly testing the waters on vegan options. That gives me some hope. I just wish there were more of us, social pressure is hard to deal with."

Psychedelics,fh73nw3,t3_f1ifdw,1581313986.0,"I've had plenty of psychedelic festival & burn experiences. It's more about expressing yourself and feeling truly free. Of course, like any large gathering of humans, there will be people having sex and people who are not. I wouldn't say it's the main aspect to the experience, at all. I'm positive you are not the only festival-goer that is not into casual sex & abusing psychedelics; I go to these events and neither am I.

People are simply more open to radical self-expression in those settings. I would argue that people dressing in ""revealing"" clothing or even running around nude, does not equal a sexual environment. Once you overcome the culture shock, you realize no one really bats an eyelid. It can be as non-sexual or sober as you want it to be. To me, the important thing is whether the event helps to foster a culture of understanding the concept of enthusiastic consent.

Watching videos of psychedelic festival environments is very different from actually attending them. Find one that fits your interests and go for it. Or don't. No one's forcing you. :)"

I‚Äôve worked so many pointless menial hard labor jobs and it‚Äôs extremely hard to cope when you‚Äôre working just as a wage slave. Based on this post alone, you seem like an intelligent person. I think for most intelligent people, we think deeply and critically about all aspects of life. If we don‚Äôt create our own meaning to our existence, we end up depressed because the system is flawed and favors worker bees who can be more simple-minded. (I don‚Äôt mean to judge anyone by saying that - some people find meaning even in the worst/hardest of jobs. I‚Äôm just not one of those types, either.)

Perhaps think of careers that would help you feel like you‚Äôre contributing to making the world, or even just your community, a better place. This world is fucked up, for sure. But that‚Äôs seemingly the only solace I have found, personally ‚Äî contemplating how to develop a career that will lessen the suffering of others.

If that‚Äôs not really your thing, maybe try to think of what interests you and how to turn that into a career.
College or trade school can at least get you more skills and expand your options. You can even teach yourself without school, ofc, but either way it helps to have valued knowledge or skills. 

Then again, I know how bad depression can get, and that sometimes it feels impossible to think of interests or long-term goals. You will have better days and this too shall pass someday. 

In the end, no one has more control over your destiny than yourself. If you don‚Äôt want to be a wage slave, then find a way out, even if it takes a long time. You have so much value as a human being and the power to overcome anything, I promise you. It‚Äôs going to be ok."
