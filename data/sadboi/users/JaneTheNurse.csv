schizoaffective,eyhv44p,t1_eyhury1,1567093180.0,"Exactly! There actually was a very cool study done recently on the brains of deceased people who lived with schizophrenia, and there was a pretty significant finding in the way the proteins were malformed in certain areas of the brain. Similar to the way they malform in diseases like Alzheimer’s. Very cool to see progress in the causes of it!"
schizoaffective,eyhstv5,t1_eyhrse4,1567092199.0,Thank you for sharing! It’s funny you mention therapists telling you to pray because the first one I brought her to acted scared when we described what she was seeing and she asked us if we had tried calling a priest yet. I was livid!!! We do have spiritual beliefs but there’s a huge difference between spiritual illness and mental illness.
schizoaffective,eyhpj1u,t1_eyhnn1c,1567090772.0,"Thank you! She’s pretty amazing! I’m sorry to hear of your experience. I hope that some day you’re able to use that to inspire others or raise awareness. 

My daughter began treatment as soon as I found out she was having issues, which at the time took us almost a full YEAR to get her help. This was when she was 7 years old. She’s had therapy and an active psychiatrist managing her symptoms ever since. She did have every test under the sun ironically because she was so unresponsive to any treatment, to rule out any other causes. It definitely is a long road with lots of us and downs, but it’s so nice to hear from others who are adults and have lived it."
schizoaffective,eyhlpsb,t1_eyhizec,1567089115.0,"It hurts my heart when I hear stories of families that are ignorant to or just plain refuse to acknowledge mental illness and the need to care for our children’s (and our own) mental health. I see times slowly changing though, and I hope we can all keep being transparent to encourage future parents. I’m actually writing my Capstone Literature Review on the benefits of incorporating a depression screening into well child exams leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment. It’s amazing the statistics I’ve found and it’s sad that there’s such a neglect present in addressing adolescent’s mental health. 

I really resonated with your descriptions of seeing various things as my daughter often describes things very similar. Stress worsens it, hence the increase in symptoms with the start of school. I think viewing some of these hallucinations in the way you describe may help her identify more of her own feelings and the role they play. One of her traumas she relives is hurting a sibling during a psychotic episode. 

I am soo happy to hear you have a strong support system available to you. I am working on expanding ours, though I have a tendency to want to do it all myself so to speak. Thanks again for reaching out!!!"
schizoaffective,eyhe243,t1_eyhdeet,1567085826.0,Thank you for the kind words! I am so happy that she has found her outlet and that you have yours. It’s such a devastating thing to experience at times and it gives her a little break in her reality to lose herself in her artwork.
schizoaffective,eyhdrfy,t1_eyh6x51,1567085699.0,"Thank you so much! It’s really nice to hear others’ experiences for her and myself as well. She has a lot of issues with meds working, stopping, etc and cycles frequently through them as well. She will be so happy about the art compliments, it’s so important to her and brightens her day. I appreciate the offer to talk, I will let her know. How old are you now if I may ask? I have a soft spot for kids and families going through this as well, though from a different perspective than yours. I’m currently a RN working toward advance practice as a Psychiatrist Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. It would mean the world to me to give back to other families in a time where help can sometimes seem so far away."
schizoaffective,eyh4pzi,t1_eyh2rmo,1567081849.0,"Thanks you so much for the kind words, I try my best to instill hope, but teenagers alone without the addition of mental illness, have a tendency to only see the here and now. Hormones have definitely changed her experience and it will be a ride I am sure. It’s nice to be reminded though that time changes all. I really appreciate the recommended reading. I will absolutely read your journal, I think it’s wonderful that you are sharing your experiences to help other understand and relate. Again, thank you so much!"

schizoaffective,eygor1p,t1_eyfuivj,1567073872.0,"Thank you, that means a lot. She has been having symptoms her whole life and started hallucinating at 7 years old, at least that’s when they got bad and I was able to get her help. I already do see her growing so much in the last couple years. School is such a stressful time too, she’ll be happy to hear this advice though, thank you!"
