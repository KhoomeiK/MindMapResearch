It's like a weird yoga juju thing they say tension from sadness, anxiety and trauma is stored in the hips and lower stomach/bowels. When you open up your hips and it's a bit stretchy feeling, like sitting cross legged, it can release a ton of feelings.

I'm not sure if it's maybe confirmation bias (probably is) but I've experienced uncontrollable crying after doing feel hip opening stretches.

I will probably get down voted for commenting this stuff, but I just wondered about your position while meditating, and if anyone else had experienced hip opening and sudden sadness and crying but then feeling release from that."

auslaw,fmfzr1j,t3_futxp9,1586038264.0,"It sounds like you want to be a detective, not a lawyer. 

You say you've looked into it and your not interested in being a police officer first.

You're trying law school but you aren't interested in studying the menial. It doesn't sound like you want to be a criminal lawyer, unless it's prosecutions you are after. Even then, it's menial. Lots of deskwork, lots of paperwork. Law is drudgery. I speak as a family lawyer though. I have law school friends who are now in the DPP and a police prosecutor and their work hasn't changed, just the employer.

Mate, with all due respect you need a dose of reality. Unless there's serious unethical and unrealistic nepotism involved, you need to rise up the ranks. Even then, most that do find themselves into positions through nepotism tend to fail abysmally when afforded that opportunity. No experience, no allies or friends. 

It seriously still sounds like you want to be a detective. So put up with the drunks and the homeless and the theives. Pay your dues, these lessons are important because you learn more than just how to deal with drunks. You're learning how to read people, how to respond to and to question difficult people. How to assess dangerous situations. How to work in a team. Networking and making allies. 

People have more respect for those that work their way to where they want to be and wade through the shit to get there. How often do you hear gripes and resentment towards people whose uncles got them their position? You don't want that, people don't respect that. And you will need to command respect to be a good detective who gets the juicy difficult crime cases.

You don't need law school to be a detective. Look into justice studies."
