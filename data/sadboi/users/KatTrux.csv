Unfortunately there's a lot of assholes like this guy that make claims of having had something, just to feel better about themselves.
I too would want to punch him in the face."
alcoholism,f3e2ofk,t1_f3dhwop,1570855224.0,Oh my gosh! Me too. My mom let us watch horror movies for as long as I can remember. I remember having nightmares about them. I hate horror movies now. But at the time seemed normal.
bipolar,f3e2hy1,t3_dgn12o,1570855018.0,"Yes, I really struggle to answer the phone or make a phone call."
BipolarReddit,f3e1sqp,t3_dgolpw,1570854222.0,Yes! I go from really high focus and productivity to not being able retain information or focus on anything. Simple tasks become so difficult.
bipolar2,f2dhaop,t1_f2dbxem,1570154196.0,Oh my gosh yes I can relate to those detailed plans.
bipolar2,f2chzwi,t3_dctlde,1570138421.0,"For me, once the hypomania hits, I start a project of some sort, that I just feel I must do. I become obsessed with it, on average about 3 weeks. Then I go buy all the books and supplies for chosen project that includes way more than what's actually needed, such as 10 books on the subject. I max out my card if I don't have the cash or I don't pay my bills to buy things. One time I decided to start a jewelry business and maxed out all my cards on supplies, website, etc, only to lose interest in it after depression hit. 

When hypomania subsides I crash and abandon every project. Each time it happens it's always something new. I will stay obsessed with a given project stay up all night doing it, get mad when asked to do something else, then sometimes start drinking lots of alcohol as it's the only thing that takes me away from it. Or I drink and work on the project all night. 

But once I got on meds, I stopped this, and have been working on getting my debt repaired. 

Short answer is not all of us over spend, but the criteria would definitely be what's causing a negative impact on the person."
bipolar2,f2ccvr3,t1_f2bgfnd,1570136764.0,This almost exactly the same as my story. It all changed once the meds kicked in. Now slowly paying off my debt.
bipolar2,f18x709,t3_d85l0o,1569264708.0,"I sleep pretty normal also when hypo, except maybe a few hours less also. I also find when hypo I can stay awake as long as I want to without any difficulty especially if I am obsessed with a project (usually the case.) But still sleep if  I try."
bipolar2,ezfvw3n,t3_d0w7dn,1567885243.0,This is exactly what I experience! I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 2.
bipolar,ex55e3f,t1_ex51a9p,1566016985.0,I do this exact thing!
alcoholism,ewx1ui6,t3_cq6jwm,1565841536.0,"I've been taking it for a year. I've had some slips when taking it, but drank much less than normal. I still have to work at not drinking at all, but the Naltexone helps.
The Sinclair method hasnt worked well for me, but it works well for brother. 
I recommend it if you have a healthy liver. It can damage your liver faster if you drink with it."
