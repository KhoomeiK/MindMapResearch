Like screen shotting her Facebook, doing impressions of her and straight up complaining and bitching about her. I have said not to do it (i am the manager). I have complained to them, told them how out of line it is and no longer partake in the group at all. I’m looking for work elsewhere but it’s difficult with the imminent recession.

These people, half of whom are sweet funny people, are mocking a VOLUNTEER who works UNPAID with no complaints and only enthusiasm.

ireland,fqhipje,t1_fqhfyxy,1589377799.0,"I think people will be more conscious of the elderly and their community in general which is great. A fantastic hangover from this will (I hope!) be a revitalized morale. People are being kinder, more patient, less rushed/selfish. I don’t think it’ll be a 180 change but it’ll be a positive change. 

I think offices and office buildings will not be as much in demand and people will be prioritising (and supported by businesses to lower *their* overheads) to work home- at least part time. Then as a result I think shared offices will become more popular (personally a NIGHTMARE having to move your shit away at the end of every day). I also fear that this “work from home” *may* mean some of our tech industry jobs can now be outsourced so we may see a further hit to the economy long term, but I don’t know how bad the impact would be. 

I think people are going to prioritise staycations over travel for the coming couple of years. But it won’t compensate our hospitality sector enough so we will see more places closing. 

Related to WFH, I think the city centre retailers will be screwed. I think people will commute less, and offices won’t be willing to pay high city rents so people will be staying closer to home. So less city footfall. Increase of online retail as a preference. 

Also might see rents and city focused housing panic reduce... might see a resurgence in commuter town businesses and and revitalisation of villages but... that seems a little extreme."
