depression,eqskgz2,t3_bzc9jt,1560286941.0,"I lowkey wish you weren't dealing with this!  I had something recently push me over the edge. I had someone threaten to kill me and rape my SO. It drove me bat shit mad and I ended up pushing a good friend out of a moving vehicle during a Manic swing. Fastforward 3 gallons of vodka latter.... I was forced to stay at an inpatient clinic from 5/31 to 6/5 due to suicidal ideation, voices, etc...  My medicine got adjusted. I had a week to think about everything without being stressed. I feel productive again, and its like the clouds are parting for the sun. 

&#x200B;

As someone has already said remember that this is just a moment in time. Also, know that you don't always have to be productive.  Productivity is not the meaning of life."
