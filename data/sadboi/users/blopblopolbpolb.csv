depression,f4uq9gd,t3_dlfw2v,1571823908.0,"I've just tried for so long that it's hard to keep trying anymore. When you feel the way I have for \~15 years, suicide always on your mind, how do you even get past that? I'm pretty close to my siblings and my mom and it would devastate them if I killed myself. It's getting harder to keep going every day. I just wish something would kill me so it wouldn't be a suicide, maybe then it'd be easier for them to accept rather than thinking they could have done anything to save me.

Mom is finally with a good guy and she has been really happy with him recently and I wouldn't want to ruin that. Brother is having a kid and seems to be happy as well. I think my other brother is depressed too, so I always do my best to make sure he knows that I care about him. My sister had a kid at 19 and she is struggling, I wish I could help her, but I'm not doing that well either.

I'm 30 now, crap job, crap life, never happy. I just want to fade away."
