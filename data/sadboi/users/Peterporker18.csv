I mean I still have an oily t-zone and dryness in some areas, depending on the season, but I stopped using product and only exfoliaters. It really helps. My skin is very sensitive, I'll even break out from Aloe Vera. I'm guessing your skin was free of all the harsh chemicals and just needed the naturalist thing there was...water."

needadvice,flfd2a3,t3_fogil1,1585103528.0,I'm not sure about the guidelines. But that sounds like total bull. If they really wanted to protect people they would have everyone just stay home. Besides at a time like this you would think they need as much help. Especially in the medical field.
relationship_advice,flfc1j3,t3_fnw16b,1585102821.0,Fuck ya. But That's me. Birthdays are a big deal. Even if they weren't if it's the bday of someone i love it instantly becomes important because i love them too and their important. I say fuck him. And find a guy who will make ur bday feel like you were just born again. Happy birthday by the way. I hope it wasn't a complete drag.
Anxiety,flfbkse,t3_fo6h6w,1585102500.0,Idk if it's me. But sometimes i get bad anxiety and then i get sudden itches. And i keep scratching random parts of my body. Maybe im broken or sum. But it happened to me when i had to go online for a video chat for school bcuz of the virus. I thought i would have to show my face and saw only me and one other RUDE girl showed hers. And i didn't wanna suddenly leave after the teacher saw me. So i started getting anxious and noticed i kept scratching.
AskMeAnythingIAnswer,flfbav4,t3_fo8jwr,1585102315.0,Me tooooo. I like cheesecake though or ice cream. But I'd probs always choose salt over sugar. Ig I'm salty not sweet lol.

depression,fi5ra3o,t3_f6f23k,1582168975.0,"They didn't deserve you. They just didn't understand because they didn't go through the same things. Ik a lot of people who need to get away from "" depressed people"" and I was even taught in one program to stay away from people who are ""negative"" because it makes it hard to be happy, in some aspect I can understand both sides. Like if someone was really deep into a drug issue and said they would stop and didn't, it's hard not to walk away. But don't blame yourself. My ex was a piece of shit who used me everyday for sex for like a year straight and the last time I saw them they raped me, I was really depressed before them, they took advantage because they were literally a psychopath. And I've seen a lot I shouldn't have as a kid, still do, but I've been able to walk away stronger than I was before. One day hopefully you too will find the strength to say FUCK THIS SHIT and go get yourself a nice plate of mozeralla sticks or any food you really like and member that no matter what you are Badass bcuz you say you are and it's all gonna work out in the end."
depression,fi5pjrb,t3_f6cgry,1582167957.0,"Keep moving forward! You got this. Keep telling urself it til you believe it. It might seem like bullshit. Hell maybe it is. Even I don't believe myself somerumes, but I do know that if you continue to do something eventually it will become a habit. Keep telling yourself you're gonna be okie. And take life inch by inch no need to rush anything. But please do think about all the things in life that you would miss out on. Ik the world can be a bad place. And it might possibly be worse than it is good. But when you do find those things worth fighting for then you're gonna forget you were ever sad from the start. For me it helps to set goals ik it's hard heck I got so depressed for a few years I stopped drawing and I still can't motivate myself too. But I dnt feel as sad as before because I have a plan to move out soon save money and hopefully one day see the world. To wake up one day in a new country and see the same sunset that I saw when I was a kid, the same sun my mum has, and my grandma, and everyone else before. DON'T LET ANYONE EVEN YOURSELF take away the power you have. You can do whatever you set your mind to. It's up to you and no one one else, but don't forget you aren't alone. It helps me to listen to some good music, happy music. Music from the 60 and 70's tends to be very uplifting. And the 80's :))) disco is nice if you wanna dance around ur room."
