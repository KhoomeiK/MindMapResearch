RVLiving,fhclke4,t3_f25ht2,1581465463.0,"I bought my RV used last year! It's a 1988 Fleetwood jamboree rallye. When I bought it, it only had 48k miles on it and now it has like almost 50k from me living in it full time and traveling. The biggest thing for me buying an old RV was just does it run? Anything in the cabin could be dealt with. luckily it runs great. About a week into me having it it started to rain and I realized very quickly that their was a major leak above the driving cab in the ceiling above the cab bed. So bad that I had to have it completely ripped out and have new wood installed because it had rotted that part of the ceiling completely out. The only other fixes it needs are the generator has got something wrong with it and won't run and the propane leaks if it's on so I have to get that fixed as well. As far as that everything else is solid. I would just make sure everything is in working order as well as the engine goes so it doesn't break down on you that's the biggest thing especially if you're going to be living in it full time. I got mine for 5k and I thought it was a good deal. Aside from the ceiling situation and not having off grid heat this time of year everything is great."

AskReddit,fgjfyzz,t3_eynu3k,1580843236.0,Paying rent. I gave up living week to week and bought an old RV outright so I could take the stress of having no money out of my life because rent was completely sucking me dry every check to the point where I didn’t even have enough to feed me and my dog at the end of the week. Now I have a house on wheels with a king sized bed a kitchen heat air conditioning electricity provided by my cabin battery a shower a kitchen sink and a bathroom and can move my life around as I please. All rent free. I have never been so stress free in my life. I recommend it to absolutely everyone.
RVLiving,ff9qqwb,t1_ff90j6k,1579718925.0,yeah I agree with everyone here. I did a lot of research because I wanted a pull behind and after learning all of the ends and outs of it decided it was a lot safer and more practical to have one with a cabin that was just attached to the driving cab like a class C. towing isn't as simple as you're probably thinking it is. There's many factors that go into a tow trailer.
RVLiving,ff9q6g4,t3_esbzdr,1579718508.0,"tbh if you live off grid I pay nothing but gas, insurance, and propane. I love it. It has been extremely cheap compared to renting an apartment. Even some RV parks are 350-450 a month to park if you want electric without having to run your generator. There are also some RV parks that only allow permanent monthly payments for long term residents! This community is a lot larger than a lot of people realize! And I truly believe for me personally it has been a cheaper way to live and save money! I wouldn't recommend getting something that's that large. I have a 27 footer that's perfect. It's definitely not as big as a class A but it has a full kitchen, a king sized bed, a shower, a toilet, a bathroom and kitchen sink. Also keep in mind that gas mileage is NOT what it is in regular vehicles. I get about 8-10 mpg in mine and its an 88. filling the water tanks, what kind of gear you carry, and especially towing a vehicle will bring the mpg down in some cases dramatically. I opted out of towing my vehicle and put it in storage. I drive this thing everywhere pretty comfortably without issues. there's just some roads and bridges I can't get under but that's about it. Also remember that when driving a high profile vehicle you need to REALLY pay attention to the weather. I tend to try to avoid driving in heavy rain and wind. Especially wind because it will blow you around a lot which is kind of nerve wracking at first but once you learn how to ride the wind especially from busses and 18 wheelers blazing past you it isn't so bad. :) good luck and I definitely over everything recommend rubber tramp life!"

AskReddit,f293g3r,t3_dcah97,1570079182.0,"Everyone is familiar with the well known poet and horror master Edgar Allen poe. However most people aren’t familiar with the eerie coincidence that happened. In 1838 Edgar Allen Poe’s novel was the published, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym. The story centers around a crew on a ship by the name of Grampus who find themselves stranded on the ship with no food or water. The crew then has to decide which one of them will be sacrificed to provide meat for everyone else. They decide on a former mutineer named Richard Parker who is then stabbed to death; his hands, head and feet thrown overboard. The two remaining crew members are close to death at the time of rescue. Here’s where it gets fucking weird, the year is 1884 and a yacht named the mignonette leaves England bound for Sydney, Australia. The yacht ended up sinking and the four man crew barely made it out in the lifeboats alive. One of the men on the ship is a 17 year old man by the name of, get this, Richard Parker who was eaten by the other crew members so they could survive after stabbing him to death just like in the story. If that isn’t one of the most odd coincidences ever I don’t know what is."

I think it really shows her that even if something doesn’t work out that you can still have a mature adult relationship. Even though you guys aren’t together anymore y’all are in a way still a family unit in a weird split way and she has to respect that for the sake of your kid.

occult,ey5d0m3,t1_ey4tygv,1566828549.0,"My experience with him started when I was 3. I don’t remember the first time I ever saw him but I just remember noticing him multiple times every single hour to the point where even as a toddler I knew it was real and it wasn’t something I was imagining. For the first 4-5 years until I was 7 or 8 I could only see him out of the corner of my eye. He was about 9 ft tall and the blackest black of a shadow I have ever seen. His outline was a tall man with a cape and a top hat. He scared the shit out of me. I remember I used to throw myself on the floor as a kid and scream at him to go away and cry because I was terrified. Eventually it became physical and at that point I knew he was real. The first time he ever came into physical contact with me I remember clearly that I was making something in the microwave, probably spaghettios or something I was like 7, and I felt something grab all of my hair and pull it like you would if you were tying your hair up into a pony tail and then it yanked my hair SO HARD that my neck cracked when my head was pulled back and my scalp was actually bleeding. The hair pulling was a common occurrence after that. I also would wake up with scratches down my arms and sometimes it would happen when I was awake and it was a horrible burning sensation. He would also throw things at me. I cannot even count how many times I have watched something levitate off of a table and come flying at me from across the room. This continued until I was 13 when I saw him for the second to last time. It was summer and I was home alone and walked to the top of the steps from my room to go downstairs to get a drink and I saw him for the first time in my direct line of vision which scared the shit out of me.  I took it has a sign that things were about to get worse and I screamed at the top of my lungs for him to go away and that I didn’t want him here and he disappeared. After that for the first time in 10 years I didn’t see him for a few days and I thought it was finally over then one day I was walking to my sisters room and had to pass the doorway to the 3rd floor of the house to get there and there he was just standing in the doorway leaned up against the frame staring at me. That was the last time I saw him but i feel like I have felt him sense then. In fact I was told by a medium I went to that knew nothing of him that “you have a lot of friends but you need to get rid of the black one in the hat” I could feel my skin immediately go about 10 shades more pale than I already am haha. But I’ve experienced a lot of weird things. Lots of poltergeist activity and doppelgängers were probably the 2nd scariest experience to him. I do believe it was a gift, not him obviously but everything else I could experience. Everyone in my family has a little bit of something spiritual going on I believe especially my grandmother who has vivid premonitions that come true. Her and I have a really weird bond and always know when something isn’t right with the other. When theres something wrong with her I will always wherever I am smell the strong scent of the perfume she wears and I know I need to check up on her when it happens. Idk I just know I need to tune back in to what I know lives inside of me and trying to figure out how to open up a door I don’t know how I closed has been difficult."

Growing up with abuse from people who are supposed to love you and don’t makes any kind of relationship challenging. I feel like I can’t get close to people and like I push everyone away but at the same time when I’m in a romantic relationship I try hard and it’s hurtful that he doesn’t try. He has had a hard life and some awful things happen to him due to hopping freight trains, living on the street and drinking for almost 10 years. So we are both pretty damaged but I just feel like he is SO selfish. And I have gotten to the point where I don’t even want to have sex with him because it doesn’t feel legitimate and honest. I don’t ever feel like he wants to. He also tries to like plan it in advance which is so freaking weird to me I can’t even wrap my mind around “tonight a 10” like wtf"
