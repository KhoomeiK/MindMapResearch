service_dogs,fncdf1w,t3_g0wcss,1586834079.0,"I received my first SD at 16 for Bipolar type 1 and General/Social Anxiety because it was so intense.  16 years later I’m with my 3rd dog who is still a SDiT.  I’ve also been diagnosed with more mental health and neurological conditions as I’ve gotten older.  Having a Service Dog since my teens has literally saved my life.

Don’t let anyone tell you what call to make.  Just make sure it benefits and mitigates your mental and physical health.  

Panic Alert
Mood Swings
Anger Outbursts
Anxiety

Try not to think about what ‘tasks’ they need to do so much as ‘what would save my life?’

My SD’s are Suicide Alert dogs...
Tasks include - 
getting ‘help’ his dog phone and calling 911
Self-Harm reduction and blocking
Panic Alert and Reduction
Vertigo Alert and fainting 

My SDiT hasn’t learned these more advanced tasks, yet - but I always start the easiest with DBT, and using that as a base for most physical tasks.  Retrieval is also being worked on.

I recommend Lelah Sullivan’s books for clicker ‘games’ to play while teaching your dog how to be a service dog, even if using a trainer.  My dog loves it and they’re super fun, easy and with Covid, it’s keeping us busy.

Like I said - think about what would save your life.  No matter the disability, a SD should always be seen as a life saver.  Don’t let people bully you about it."
servicedogs,fncbe3u,t3_g0pmo4,1586832743.0,"A lot of hardware stores are very SD friendly as well as larger retailers such as Wal-Mart or even Costco as long as you and you’re dog remain safe.  I do not recommend anywhere that involves a routinely large amount of animals in and out, like a pet store"
servicedogs,fmwcqqg,t3_fxou4n,1586444174.0,"My first two were retired when it became clear they no longer had the stamina to go a full day.  They were both retired with family.  First dog was retired at 12, lived to 16.  Second was retired at 11, rehomed at 14 and currently almost 16.

Current dog is a SDiT - chance for career change but performs tasks great.

It depends on your dog, and if the job continues to be safe for them.  If pain, age, sickness or accident compromises your dog from working - it should be retired.  My first dog developed cataracts, my second slipped in the library when she was 11 and fell.  I called it there and then, took off her vest, took her to the vet and she stayed with me until stairs became an issue.  She was rehomed and still living the good life.

Hope this kinda gives an idea of examples of retired SD reasons and what that might mean.  Yes, I am in contact with my previous dog, but she’s in a much better situation for her.  They saved her.  My first dog stayed with my family after I moved away.  Also best situation for him.

If you can keep your retired SD - they make great teachers for your next one.  9 months with my retired SD made a huge leap forward with my SDiT.   I’m very confident in him."

OMG I thought I was alone on that.  I also hate being on the phone, but most of my therapy and doctor appointments are now via phone only.

My coping mechanisms is to write down the basics of what to expect in the conversation, like what questions to bring up.  Ask if she can take the time for you to write point form of the conversation.   Simple notes can help remember important details.

Don't give up, you're doing great"
servicedogs,fmrn360,t3_fww40m,1586328408.0,"I have a Lab/Shepard mix as a SDiT right now
Before that a Lab/wolf mix senior rescue (7yrs)
My first was a Lhasa Apso

Standard Poodle mixes make great PTST dogs for their clingy nature and ability to learn.  Very good for multipurpose 

Believe or not, bully breeds like pits and rotties are also great.  They often have a very gentle way about them, and offers a lot of confidence.  I would suggest professional trainers to work with you.  Protection dogs need to learn what is acceptable service etiquette. 

Example:  I had a ‘friend’ enter my apartment building due to faulty security lock.  They knocked on my door and tried to offer me a loosely rolled up ball of tin foil ‘that I made just with my hands.’  I knew this person only a very little, and creeped the fuck out.

My SDiT who growls at the door when something new is going on - this was not that.  It was very clear my dog was alerting me and warning the person to leave.  I said they needed to leave, only to proceed by ‘I’ve changed!  I’m a child of the lord now.’  I gave a last warning, leave before I call the police or I’ll release my SDiT

Person left, haven’t seen them since.  My SDiT has never reacted so aggressive before, and I’ve had police and ambulance come to my apartment more than once.  Always friendly but not a social boy.  He just doesn’t like too much attention but he’ll soak it up all the same.

You gotta think about what you want your dog to provide you with.  I like having a dog I can feel safe and protected, but also knowing I can trust him with family and kids.

Think of traits you’re looking for and also research shelters for dogs under 2 years.  It can be done!

Any dog can be a service dog but not every dog is capable of the work.  Be prepared for career change if self-training"

servicedogs,fmh31uf,t1_fkwi3rw,1586065146.0,"My first dog was a Lhasa Apso - He was trained as a SD but due to laws at the time did not support self-trained or rescue trained dogs.  Only dogs from expensive training kennels were acknowledged.

When I received/rescued my second dog - I did the same thing - except I worked with the MD of my province to show what a self trained, rescued SD could do.  Top it off?  She was part wolf (I didn’t pick her, she was dropped off at my door).  

So many of us came forward with our ‘non-official’ SD’s (my big girl only went inside a few select places... otherwise she was tagged as an ESA because that’s the best most of us could do.). Our laws were changed - still strict as fuck - but at least now I can at least try.

I’m on my third dog.  My first passed away at 16 in 2015.  My big girl has been rehomed to retire with retired family friends.  She’s 15.5 which has surpassed my expectations when I first adopted her.

My puppy right now is not big like my big girl or little like my Apso.  I will tell you - he will be the first and last puppy I’ll have.  He learns faster than both of them, attention span of a gnat, and has tantrums when bored... on the bright side... he’s getting better.  He is the first to be recognized as a SDiT, and I want us to succeed so bad.

My Apso and Lalf never got the chance to work - which they loved.  I hope my pup likes working and passes his exams when Covid 19 hype lowers and we get more PAT practice"

TigerKing,fmdjy4q,t3_fub3m6,1585969755.0,"Saff is fucking hot and labels should be left at the door.  Calling my husband Queer when he isn’t is the same as forcing someone to be straight when they’re not.

I just happen to fit in between that, and I’m part of the trans community as well because I have a fluctuating gender duality.  

My husband only cares about who I am.  He has never walked with me in a PRIDE parade or most PRIDE events.  I only came out to his parents last year.  He stays out not because he’s against it - but because he doesn’t understand what the Parades are for.  He doesn’t understand the fear.  That’s a straight privilege you can’t understand unless you’re forced into it.  He’s never witnessed it.

The fact that I was born female makes it easier to ‘hide’ my male persona.  I don’t like having or using pronouns for myself and I dress as neutral as possible.  

Fact of the matter is - you can fall in love with someone who may or may not originally be attracted to - but that doesn’t make you any different from who you were at the start."

Edmonton is the worst place to be.  Don’t go to a reserve unless invited and you know who you’re seeing.  Strangers aren’t often welcomed and regarded as potential threats.  People blame drugs and alcohol but sadly, it’s lack of faith and trust.  Many still recall Distribution Schools meant to ‘Christianize’ and ‘Civilize’ our people. Many children often ended up beaten to death for speaking their native language, wanting to go home, refusing to obey.  Some were killed for just being different, like me.

Calgary I found to be a better place to live if you’re going to live in a big city.  

I live up North, we just got news first case was detected here about 2 days ago.  Basically I have a rule for living in Alberta.

This doesn’t include the special battery charger (which I highly suggest using) or back up batteries.  I also recommend at least a good solid foundation on what vaping is, the benefits and downfalls, cost, potential dangers and precautions.

As an example, I always turn my device off if I travel with it.  This prevents any overloading or accidents, as I don’t trust lock mode on any device.

I use a Snowwolf MFeng UX with a Phenix King Tank and Bamboo Double Coil that was made for the tank.

 Saying all that, I love I can blow huge clouds in my apartment and not smelling like ash.  I can’t do any really neat tricks other than using my clouds to create spooky witchy pictures that more dramatic lol.

Also, if you’re a long time smoker, it’s better to switch than not quit at all.  Lots of choices on nicotine strength and flavour profiles.  I like my 6mg nic and honey or custard flavours.

I still find talking to random people that I meet extremely easy, and not much of that has changed - but I still remember people recognizing me as Scooter Girl.  The young 20 something in the pink helmet that never stopped smiling on a ride.  I guess seeing that made a lot of peoples days brighter, even if they never knew me personally.

I’m now in my early 30’s and cannot ride or drive.  I since moved away, but I’m still connected to some of my old friends.  Sometimes just having fun, whether on your own or with friends, and being different from everyone else is enough to stick out in anyone’s memory.  I mean, most riders were middle aged people on full sized bikes and I was just a kid basically.  Always be polite and respectful to those around you, whether you know them or not.

BPD,fbiocue,t3_edam3w,1576907548.0,"Letting go is one of the hardest things we go through as sufferers with BPD know too well.  Break ups, burnt bridges, death of a loved one - they hit us like a brick wall.

To walk away and coping with such a challenge is so hard for me, so this is giving me extra hope I can get better and more independent."
