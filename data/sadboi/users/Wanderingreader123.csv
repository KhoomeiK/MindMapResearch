Ingredients were:
Kikkoman Sauce (Less Salt variety)
MSG
Sugar
Mirin
Ginger
Green Onion
Cooking Oil
Chicken Stock Powder
Packaged Instant Ramen Noodles (Japanese)

The only ingredient I was missing was Fish Stock Powder. I was actually going to buy it at the asian supermarket (Hondashi, to be exact) as I shopped for them, but my folks were against it because the japanese products were expensive and they have no clue how fucking ramen is made (even though they were insistent about me doing my own cooking). I had Fish Sauce, but that shit smells awful and it's too salty as hell.

Tare was simple to do, but aroma oil and soup is where I fucked up. For aroma oil, I completely screwed up the process by draining and removing out the necessary oils to use for the ramen. For soup, I actually thought to use chicken to create the broth from another video. However, it was on that one video that I was supposed to use chicken SKINS (but the chicken meat was still good, though). Fish Stock was missing, but I had chicken stock, atleast.

But the worst part of it all? The noodles. I did not realize you were supposed to boil the water BEFORE dumping the noodles. But even then, they tasted awful.

So, there you have it. 2 out of 3 fuck ups in one sitting."

Chaotic Evil, to me, sticks out for being an underutilized alignment (as PC, anyway) and only stays in one beaten path (which just amounts to insane trolling). If Chaotic Evil was a path, it would be a road with multiple lanes and crossroads; neverending but never meeting it's destination (or perhaps it will, but with all roads leading to destruction). You can make different personalities, faces, designs, and motivations, but it's the impulse that's always consistent and one that really needs to be reined in order to avoid painting a big target on your back. That's pretty much the reason why I'm so curious about Chaotic Evil and why I've brought this question up in the first place. It's a self-contradicting mess, but one where it's ""possible"" to roleplay as, let's say, one in a million."

And from your experience, it sucks that you've had to go through with those people. The only reason I brought this up is how to best AVOID putting a big target on your back while still in the Game.

Compared to most alignments, CE just seems too ""difficult"" to roleplay, and it CAN be easy to get everyone to hate you within a heartbeat.

And I suppose my question can be ""hypocritical"" now that you mention the Chaotic Good example. Perhaps I am going to broad with it, as well.

[Force Abilities - Consume Essence] Another one that was on my first print. Wanted to be very much unstoppable. By that time, I didn't realize that Force Push, Pull, and Jump were free. So, I needed to balance out my character a bit. Plus, it would seem out of character for my Sith to be clueless.

[Events - First Kill (Band of Thugs)/ Lightsaber (Treasure)/Baptism of Fire (Esctasy of Battle)/Wandering Sentinel (Sinister Scar/Merciful)/Rival (Hostile)/Camp Fire (Confession)/Forbidden Love (Well-Kept)/Ziggurat (The Fountain)] Alright, just like the philosophies; Three's not enough. Unlike the philosophies, they certainly made a point with this one. There was a lot that I wanted to touch upon, but I'd end making a bloated mess of a first print. And all of this I planned out in my head AFTER I sent in my Sith. But it would still feel too much, though. But I'll speak about one topic, which is my favourite topic in every CYOA; romance. Now back to the Sith Mistress; if I ended up with her, not really much would deviate EXCEPT for a certain plot arc (Confession to Forbidden Love). I don't know why but tragic romances get to me. The sort of Love that you usually find end being twisted and beaten down to the point usually intrigues me for some reason. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with my current master (distant father-son relationship), but the Merlin-Nimue romance archetype (but reversed) would've been a great to emotionally torture the audience. I would go on further with the rest, but I'll save them for another day."

I should've died back then. Alone, pitiful, and tiptoeing to the edge of my death. Abandoned in an alleyway by my ""caregivers"". Where they are, I'll never know, nor do I care. What mattered was that I was but a speck in this city's eye; waiting until death draws near and no one would care about it. I accepted it, and waited. Waited until I no longer existed to everyone's eyes. Everyone... but him. I don't know why I was chosen. Most likely out of pity, but they don't teach you about those type of feelings. Regardless, he gave me his hand, and promised me that I would one day truly leave a mark upon the Galaxy, if I took up on his offer. And I did.

[Backalleys/Beggar/Despair]

My master was very much a teacher, first and foremost. Neither kind nor cruel. Still, if I were to be shaped as his successor, he will push me to the brink if he had to. During my apprenticeship, my master conditioned me to be a hardened warrior, but with a flexible mindset to get around dangerous situations. First, he would have me deprived of any comforts, such as food or water, in order for me to survive under harsh extremities. Then, he would have me ambushed with attacks, traps, and anything he could throw at me so that I would quickly adapt to whatever future attacks that would lend my way. And as I have find out during his tutelage, he was rather ""inordinary"" for a sith. He was never opened about it, as the bruises have told me, but he always seemed to have a rebel-streak among other sith lords. It never gave him much problems, but he certainly caused a few uproars. Still, he was far from a revolutionary figure, and he would rather keep to himself. Another thing to note, is that we constantly travelled. He never had a home to go back to (or none that I know of, atleast). It was very much part of his code, I guess.

[Austerity/Adaptability/Unorthodox/No Home]

Training as a Sith, I've learned from the start that I was no wizard. Regardless, I excelled in Martial Combat to make up for lacking in the Force. My master knew this and he pushed me to be ready for any close quarters. As for force-using, I was practically dead-weight, but that didn't stop me from being a problem-solver. My martial of choice is dual-wielding; always fun to keep my enemies on their heels (just makes it all the more entertaining). Much of my training had turned me into a monster on the battlefield. A mad demon let loose certainly struck fear upon my enemies. Combining aggresive assaults with acrobatic feats, it made any jedi knight look like stormtroopers on their first day to work.

[Furious Style (1 Style) - Terror, Cold Blood, Hular Zekem (3pts)/ Acrobatic Style (1 Style) - Wind Steps(1pt)/ Defensive Style (1 Style) - 360⁰ Defense (1pt)]

Even though I mastered in Combat Prowess, I was definitely not stupid enough to negelct some skills in the Force. Precognition during battle and Force Senses serve me enough to survive during combat, but not enough against Force-oriented Jedi (which I'm savvy enough to avoid at all costs).

[Battle Precognition/ Force Senses]

As much as I would love to boast about my training as a Sith, there are memories that are as clear as day to me. Sometimes, I've often pondered about from time to time. Many were quite bad that I would like to avoid talking about. As for the few, though. Few still stuck to my heart. During my training, my Master decided to test my conditioning. And so, dropped me off on a hostile desert planet. And by ""drop off"", I mean kicking me out of his forcedamned ship, with no lightsaber, and completely buck-naked for that matter. This lasted for about two weeks. Got chased by several predators (almost lost my junk off a few times), and I would've died from the elements were it not for the extensive conditioning. Looking back, I find it a bit amusing these days (in a darkly manner, that is). Another memory, on the other hand, is more uplifting. My master decided it was high-time to visit High Society for a bit. Not that we were exactly glamourous-looking, but he had some connections in high places. During the visit, I had ended up bumping with a socialite at some banquet. Can't even remember why I was there to begin with (something about assassinating a political rival on behalf of a ""sponsor""), but damn if I must confess that this woman certainly knew how to be sharp-tongued. This ivory-haired porcelain beauty possesed a sharp and keen mind that knows the ins-and-outs of politics (or as she called it ""The Game""). During our chat, it seemed she was more interested in another form of entertainment. Not gonna go into detail in what happened after that, keeping it private. But what happened after, blossomed a relationship of sorts. But Sith Code states that Love and other similar forms of connection is forbidden (as does the Jedi Code), despite the arbitrary in its laws. Still, we kept it secret, and made sure not a single trace of evidence was left behind. Did it for about 8 months during my stay and it seemed like we were a match. But despite all of this, a part of me wanted to distance itself from all of it. And so, it was high time that I moved. Coincidently, my master had decided that it was time to relocate. Before we left, I told her it was time we seperated. And this was the first time, that I saw a part of me that was reflecting back; Despair. She pleaded and begged me to stay with her till the Force takes us at last. But I didn't budge. My goals were still mandatory, and my training was incomplete. Never once looked back. My master didn't speak to me during our relocation. Guess he knew about it. Which brings me to another memory. After all the epic battles, the brutal training that I had to undergo, the knowledge of the Sith Code, none compared to what I had witnessed; my Master's confession. We were camping in preperation for an upcoming battle; one of strategic value, of sorts. It was the two of us, seperated from the other imperial regiments. Was expecting to hear him spat out some Sith wisdom in preparation. Instead, I laid witness to his lifestory. He had told me about who he was before; how he had eventually slain his cruel master after his completion; about how he once fell in love... only to throw it out for the sake of a philosophy; to even how much he hated the Sith Code. And then me. Whether it was out of pity or a sense of potential use, he took me under his wing. I never understood why he told me all of this; was it moment of weakness? A story to plead sympathy to avoid betrayal? Or a feint to let my guard down? I'll never know. But the last words he said to me, still struck me to this day. ""Don't be stronger, be better.""

[Trial - Dexterity/ Forbidden Love - Solitude/ Camp Fire - Confession]

Finally, we've come to this moment. It was time that the student had become the master. After all of the teachings he had passed down; of all the training that I had experienced; and of all the memories that were flown through me, I was finally ready to become a true Sith. And he knew it as well. One night, he had left me. Not even leaving a single goodbye. What he did leave, though, was a holocron. It contained a map, leading to unknown location (or as I eventually discoved, an old Sith temple). Setting my sights, I followed. I've arrived where he was stationed, and there, was he prepared. He said his last rites, stood himself up, and prepared for what would happened. I don't remember how it began. It was brutal. Not a single moment was wasted. He had thrown everything he had at me to prove that I was his successor. I've seen through all of it; it was simply child's play. But all of it was to soften me up. What came next was next to impossible. The earth was quakeing in my feet, flashes of lightning started to burst around us, and visions of painful memories were forming in my head. Bastard was practically cheating against me. But it only made me stronger. No, better. He was simply testing me. During all those moments, I was practically dancing in a battle-trance. No matter how many memories he tried to rip open to distract me, or how many wounds he was inflicting, my focus was strong. And in that focus, I had finally struck the killing blow. After undergoing through mental and physical exhaustion, I had achieved my goal... and yet, it never felt like a victory. I looked back to see my master. He had laid dead for a moment. I took his saber, in case he had laid a trap. But he never moved. I turned his body. And saw something that I never expected; a smile. Not one of malice, but one of peace. His training and tutelage had finally come to fruition. Paying my respects, I carried his body back to his ship, and made it into a funerary pyre. And so, concluded my training.

[Cause of Death - Epic Battle]

By now, you may be wondering of my whereabouts. Well, I've travelled from planet to planet in my late years. In search of battles to sate my bloodlust, assassinating the rich and influential in Power Plays, or simply wandering like a vagrant of sorts. But the one constants has always been coming back to see my old-flame again. I always see her from a distance, and it seems she had stayed in solitude much as I did. Save for one thing: a child. I wonder who it is. And I wonder if I could go back to her again."
