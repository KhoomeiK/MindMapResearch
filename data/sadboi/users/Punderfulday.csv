It took years to be able to leave the door to my house without  having a person literally hold my hand. I would have panic attacks in the grocery aisle. I am doing better now.

Since I have gotten better I decided I wanted to do the work the person waa ho helped me in my recovery did. I did my internship in a mental hospital. I worked mostly with people in psychosis. They are not crazy, they are ill. 

No one deserves to be dehumanized because they have an illness. We are all people. We all deserve respect, empathy and opportunities."
TrueAskReddit,fi6udxu,t3_f6s8jf,1582207648.0,"Simply put no one is crazy. That word disempowers every single person who has a mental illness.  

Do you mean psychotic? Is a person in person experiencing psychosis? Let a psychoatris decide. The person isn't crazy they are in a mental health crisis.

Is a person acting in a way you feel is irrational? Maybe that person has anxiety, PTSD, OCD, bipolar disorder, BPD etc. They are not crazy they have a mental health condition and deserve empathy. 

Is a person labile (moving quickly from emotion to another)? Maybe the person he frontal lobe trauma, maybe they are in mania, maybe they has emotional dysregulation, schizo affective disorder or even BPD. They are not crazy they have a health condition.

Does the person have flat affect and SEEMS not to experience emotions or empathy? Maybe the have Schizoid personality disorder, maybe they have schizophrenia, or even ASD. Are they crazy ? No. They may just not be physically capable of expressing emotions, it doesn't mean they don't have them.  ( Small note that ASD is a developmental disorder not a mental illness)

Are they hysterical? Yeah this one is super fucked up. Freud told everyone some big lies about hysteria: Saying shit about how hysterical women fantasized about being raped. After WW1 veterans were exhibiting the same symptoms freud described from female hysteria. They made post war rap group that changed history and how we treated so called hysteria. Turns out today we call it Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Those women with hysteria had PTSD because of sexual and physical abuse, those veterans had it from combat neither are crazy, they just had traumatic experiences that there brain was trying to make sense of and thus they were and are reliving horribly traumatic events over and over. Not crazy, its a natural response to trauma. 


Crazy and Insane are both words that have been use to harm people with mental illness and lock them away from society, in some cases force sterilization against their will. Crazy isn't a diagnosis, its not a medical term and therefore there is no treatment. There is no way to draw a line or who is and who isn't because no one is.

Plus at least 6 other friends from the community.  (This not including my indigenous friends who are from other communities)

I am highly aware of the colonial history behind social work and actually for my final Integrative project I am working on a tool to help inform new teachers who are coming into the community of the historical context, and the impact their whiteness will have on the way they connect with students and the importance of relationship building etc. I have lots of little cousins ( by proxy) who are school-aged and high teacher turnover rates are atrocious. 

Perhaps its a selfish reason but I love my partner's culture and everyone has been very welcoming to me. It just makes sense to work in the community that I will raise my kids.

She was the kind of girl who once she got into a relationship her friendships didn't matter.  I had been being stalked but an ex-classmate and even once he stopped I was not able to feel safe anywhere. Not too long after I was hospitalized and diagnosed with PTSD. Turns out the stalking also brought up some rape trauma I had tried and briefly (for 6 years) had succeeded at forgetting.

 She had being seeing this a new guy as a fuck friend  for 5 months and decided she was in love with him. He word for word called her a "" piece of shit you can't wipe of because its stuck to your ass hairs"" he would denegrate her about her wait etc. But he who were her friends compared to this guy. 

Upto when I was hospitalized I had been calling her frequently and she was avoiding my calls ( likely because she owed me rent and wither couldn't or didn't want to pay it). About 2 days into my hospitalization I give her a call from the hospital phone, she picked up because she wanted to know who the private number was. We talked for about 20 minutes. She promised to come visit me. Never died. Also said she would store my washer and dryer when I moved.  Never did. Also never answered any of my calls after that. 3 weeks later no visit, no message, no contact and I am discharged from the hospital.

I messaged her multiple times to let her know to get her stuff because I was going to move out. She said she had  I moved.

A few weeks later she messages me to say she can't find ger grandfather's ring. I hadn't  seen I told her I would get back to her. Maybe a month later I unpacked my jewelry box and found it. I message her right away and say that she can come pick it up any time. Just let me know.

At this point I was still willing to forgive the debt if it meant keeping her as my friend and planned on letting her know that hey "" the 2000$ you owe me is excused. I won't  lend you money again but I love you and I dont want to lose you over something as petty as m okkney even if I am flat broke"" 

Hindsight is 20/20 folks.

6 months pass she never comes to retrieve it. I find out her boyfriend is threatening to have his  friend wait outside me door and cause me physical harm if I dont give them the ring. She had apparently told him I was holding it hostage for money or something.

This surgery means the parents choose if their child is going to be a girl or a boy moments after birth. The affect of this on intersex kids is negative. 
1. These surgeries are unnecessary and cause harm to the child. There is not guarantee this child will ever be able to experience pleasure from  contact when they come of age. There is often nerve damage from the surgery.
2. The child's gender is not affected by the surgery. Meaning mom and dad says its a boy and then that boy grows up not understanding why he has a feminineside. Often children who find out later into childhood will transition to the opposite gender.

AskReddit,fg4xmvq,t3_ewmszg,1580513398.0,Far Cry 2. I couldn't  figure out how to get to the base in the tutorial. ( I was 14 and I have dyslexia and it affects my ability to spacially orient myself with mini maps ...l because I genuinely don't  know my left from my right.) I feel like I have gotten better at gaming in the last 12 years and would be willing to try it again.

 S/he would then be aware of the problem without you having to bring it up an see her/his react. Then when you are in session s/he will likely bring it up so you can elaborate and explore what is going on."

AskReddit,fg2cyeu,t3_ewbty3,1580442661.0,"Okay, so I was to meet up with this uber hot girl and her boyfriend for a threesome.  They picked me up and I immediately regretted agreeing to it because her boyfriend was a colleague of a lot of my friends. We met, we hung out, and it came up that I was a singer.
