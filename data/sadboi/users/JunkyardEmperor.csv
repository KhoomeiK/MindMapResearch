There\`s also another suggestion - do not shut the gates during an epidemic, if your character is brave or charitable. That's what brave people do, right? Stayin with the poor, helping them etc. Also you can try and switch to religion if your character is ill. Not just to heal, but because it was medieval way of thinking - if you are diagnosed cancer or some kind of pox, you go and pray for your survival. If your character is cynical or deceitful, you can pick seduction and go whoring instead - you will die soon, who cares? Another idea - if your character is good at stewardshit, then you can go for building and trading instead of conquering - that will be rational and historically accurate."
