tinnitus,fq66fk9,t1_fq5bky2,1589125447.0,"I'm 34 y/o, I never cared about my hearing when I was younger, used to have a band, go dancing and stay near the giant speakers and listen to music on my walkman/diskman (I'm so old) at full volume, all of those things can damage your ear in a different way, there are different parts of your ear that can get damaged. The tinitus ""inside the head"" in particular is caused by some sort of ""hairs"" inside your inner ear that get messed up and the brain interprets this damage as a constant tone (there are many articles online that explain it better, I.E: https://hearcolorado.org/how-does-tinnitus-happen/) if you're like me then you notice you can hear everything else just fine even with the high pitch tone full blasting inside your head... this is still inner ear damage but just for certain high frequency sounds, speech and things you hear every day come in much lower frequencies but if you were to damage the other parts of your ear (eardrum, hammer, etc) you could suffer hearing loss so its always recommended to use earplugs if what you're doing involves loud sounds. People that works with loud machinery use them all the time, I mean, that's what they are for. My uncle (RIP) went hunting when he was young, someone shot a gun right next to his head and boom... good bye eardrum, he went semi deaf in that ear for the rest of his life, so yeah, you can't go wrong with those. But don't just take my word for it, study how the ear organ works, how all our senses work and don't be paranoid, just take the necessary precautions, after all remember that you're just a brain inside a meat and bone mech suit and these senses are your only connection to the outside world so you should take care of all of them the best you can. Ok I started getting philosophical meaning this post is too long, sorry XD, take care!"

tinnitus,fq1qn3c,t1_fq1laex,1589048117.0,"Sorry I translated it wrong from Spanish, it's basically any disturbance in your ear caused by damage or another source (punctured ear drum or accumulation of wax, etc) it doesn't feel the same as regular tinitus because it disrupts your hearing while tinitus is inside your head but you can hear the other sounds just fine (at least in my own experience) in Spanish tinitus is also another form of acufen. I guess the difference is what part of your entire hearing system is being affected."

But don't think even for a second that life is about failing or not failing someone else, that happens to all of us and sometimes that's exactly what brings change, a lot of times for the best, and then you look back and realize those moments led you to where you are now, there's always new roads to explore, death is the final destination, you'll get there no matter what so just enjoy the ride while you can, trust me it's worth it.

tinnitus,fq1byhz,t3_ggh7p9,1589044230.0,"You can definetly tell the difference between an acufen and Tinnitus at least in my own experience, tinitus feels like it's coming from inside my own head while regular acufens feel like they come from inside my ear (like someone place a miniature speaker inside blasting a high pitch tone), actually masking other sounds which Tinnitus doesn't. I'd check with my doctor about the left ear acufen, could be wax or something else :)"
tinnitus,fq18evr,t3_gfw3eh,1589043177.0,"Look, at first I felt just like you and it would be a lie to tell you that I don't wish for it to go away and leave my brain the fuck alone but after a while I realized that just moving on with my life as usual makes me completely ignore the tinitus for days at a time, the human brain is an amazing thing, it can ignore sounds and smells (when you go to a friend's house they all smell different but after a while you stop smelling it, right?) shit, there's even a part almost in the middle of you eye nerve that CANNOT SEE, your brain basically ""photoshops"" it out and you wouldn't even know about it if you couldn't test it (look it up) same happens with tinitus to the point you only hear it in completely silent environments or when your blood pressure rises. My point is that the best way to live with tinitus is to continue doing the things you love and forget about it, and when you hear it, accept that it's a part of you, it's inside your head, welcome it into your life, give it a name if you want XD but don't be afraid of it, when your brain is occupied it just ignores it :)"
Vive,fq15706,t1_fq120d2,1589041897.0,"It's just an opinion, I'm not saying anything it's just from my own experience, OP should buy whatever he feels is better, bases also suffer from tracking issues when you have reflective surfaces around. And yes, base tracking could be a little better (putting your hands behind your head and not track only by accelerometers, for example) but not enough to affect gameplay and it definetly doesn't out balance the convenience of mobility and much much easier setup. I don't know about the rift S, like I said I just tested inside out tracking with a cheaper Lenovo explorer and it just worked great. I've been watching video reviews about the Quest and it's the one I would get after having a Vive myself."
tinnitus,fq12qz8,t3_gfr0t9,1589040959.0,"Yeah same here, I realized I had tinitus last year (I believe I've had it for much longer and didn't know about it if that makes any sense) and I feel like the high pitch tone I hear is ""inside my head"" mostly on the right side so I hear it all the time (unless my brain is ignoring it or I'm wearing headphones or something) but it doesn't affect my ""external"" hearing."
Vive,fq0xadr,t1_fpz1mgp,1589038776.0,"You'll be fine for the games you wanna play. I got a Vive and same specs as you (actually a little lower) and the games you mentioned run great, HL: Alix also works... But if I were you I'd buy an Oculus Quest since you can take it anywhere and also use it with your PC as well, just like the Vive but better resolution, but the best part is not having to deal with bases, trust me, inside out tracking works great, there is almost no difference (the one I tried myself with inside out tracking was a cheap Lenovo explorer and worked just as well as the tracking on my Vive) the only reason I'm stuck with the Vive is because I'm an early adopter and I can tell you the best part about VR is sharing it with someone else, so in my opinion the quest is the best way to go. Oh! and it's also a lot cheaper :)"

SuicideWatch,fefbd9p,t3_eoqdch,1579052586.0,"Hey, we're here for you.

I understand what you're feeling. I just want to tell you, what you now perceive as ""your life falling apart for the tenth time"" are just stones in your path, you can learn from them and move on, you wont trip on the same ones again, you can learn to love this complicated parts of your life when they become the foundation of your future self. We're all going to die some day, we don't really know what happens after... if anything, but what we know for sure is that we have this life and for what I can assume, since you live with your mom and bro, you still got a lot of it ahead of you. There's this ""stages"" in life where your mind, your body and your thoughts change radically and that's when you will look back at this moments feeling proud of not giving into the void today or after, feeling happy of what you haven't missed. Concentrate in your studies but also in finding what makes your gears turn, it doesn't matter what it is really, just as long as you find yourself by doing it. That's my advice, don't end your life because others would be sad, just don't end it because whats ahead is worth the trouble of living. Sorry for my broken English, get well soon! (from the fever) :)"
