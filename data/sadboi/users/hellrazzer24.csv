COVID19,fr18ctc,t1_fr0wcrq,1589815164.0,"Most likely not. Here is a [study](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/61/6/980/451431) we can extrapolate from. 

> Hundreds of millions of vaccinations are administered in the United States each year. 

and

> VAERS received 2149 death reports, most (n = 1469 [68.4%]) in children. Median age was 0.5 years (range, 0–100 years); males accounted for 1226 (57%) reports. 

This is from the years 1997-2013. If we look at average age of death being 6 months old, then most of these vaccines that are considered a ""factor"" in the death are at most 3 months since injection ( I don't believe kids get their first vaccines until 3 months old). So that probably discredits the idea that anything happens after a year or so, let alone a decade. 

Additionally, there is this at the end.

> For child death reports, 79.4% received >1 vaccine on the same day. Inactivated influenza vaccine given alone was most commonly associated with death reports in adults (51.4%).


So most of the infants that died due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (which can happen anyways btw) got a vaccine that same day. 

The idea that something is injected into your bloodstream and displays no adverse effects for years would be a scientific mystery as well, let alone a decade or two. 

Lastly, let's also look at the denominator. 100M+ vaccines given every year. Probably means Billions given over 15 years of this study, and we have 2149 death reports, which I'm assuming there isn't black and white causal relationship between all of them. If we use 2Bil as our denomintor, which is very low, we would get a death rate of .00011%. At least 3 Logs lower than the ***best case scenario*** IFRs for COVID19.

I just got back into it after taking a 3 month break. I think I'm getting close to the end of my first playthrough but I'm not certain. The game is excellent; one of the best games I've ever played. I love the variety of the combat, it always feels satisfying and fun, never stale. The bosses are always somewhat challenging and require mixing up strategies sometimes. I die often on Valkries, which I love fighting. 

The story and pacing are also top notch IMO. I've played God of War 3 before, but I never got far (never played the first 2). As a newcomer to the series, I feel like I know a ton about the plot and the characters. The addition of the talking head to include banter and backstory in the ""down moments"" is excellent as well. The dialogue never seems to run out of cool things to say or tidbits to explain. I'm quite impressed by it to be honest. 

There is also a TON to do and explore. Being in my 30s with kids, I doubt I'll get a chance to 100% this game. In the past, this would be the type of game I would 100% complete and probably go for a ""hard"" or ""insane"" equivalent run and really beat the game. The world feels big, but not too big. You can't really get lost, but there is a ton to do. 

Overall, I can confidently say its one of my favorite games ever. I will miss it when I'm done with it. The developers did so much right with this game, I'm surprised its not talked about more often. Open world, but not boring and dull. Great characters and story. Great progression and fighting system. Many skills and ""runes"" to try. Upgrade system isn't overly complicated or penalizing. 10/10 game.

Imagine the Moderna vaccine hits a snag in Phase 3 while ChaDoX1 cruises through in the UK, wouldn't the USA want to have their millions and millions of doses in production at that point? 

Just to ponder a bit more on it... the ChaDoX1 vaccine, if all goes well, is expected to have a <5 million vaccines ready for the UK come September. Operation Warp Speed is planning to have 300M doses in the USA by January 2021 (100M by November 2020).

COVID19,fqaxali,t1_fqarlzw,1589226876.0,"> If you're one of the people whose ""kid-like"" immune system nukes CV19 so well that you don't have enough antibodies to register positive on a serology screen, then you certainly have little to fear from any future infection.

We can't know that for sure, can we? Immune system ""health"" can change over the months/years. Your first bout with COVID19 could be asymptomatic because your T-Cells are either really good or a really high amount, but that doesn't mean if you contract COVID19 in the next year your TCells will be up to the same task? Unless T-Cells themselves have some ""memory"" for fighting COVID19 again."
Anxiety,fqawqu5,t1_fqar753,1589226613.0,"if 99% are really mild then that probably goes to show the virus did mutate somewhat and is causing milder disease. Either that or their testing is just capturing the vast majority of the spread now. Either way, its good news."
Anxiety,fqawed2,t1_fqapg3j,1589226447.0,"The closest vaccine we have to COVID is the MERS vaccine. It took us about 5 years but we also had time as a luxury since the outbreaks were just a few cases here and there. That is an example of a vaccine we created as a ""just in case"" vaccine. We would have done the same with SARS had it not disappeared completely for almost 2 decades."

Games,fq6nsh4,t1_fq5y7dp,1589135094.0,"Most people complained when it came out about how bad it was compared to Arkham City. I personally really liked Arkham Knight (other than the over reliance on the batmobile). 

To be honest, I love all 4 games in the series."
