AskWomen,fde1o2b,t1_fdbtkwo,1578329170.0,"I struggle with this myself. I am bisexual too and “love women” like that. As far as the other stuff you said, I feel like I still don’t like “traditional” girly stuff and I never really have. I don’t like dressing girly, I don’t like wearing makeup, I don’t like the gossip mags or really any reality TV. I like my video games and Netflix and shooting the shit with my friends. That’s about it. 

I don’t really feel like I’m “not like other women” because a lot of women are like that. I do fear some women because of my negative experiences with a lot of women being catty and shit talkers behind your back... but this isn’t different to how I fear men because most men in my life have been abusive and liars and cheaters. Idk maybe this is just how I am?"

That being said, eventually after years of your behavior you will see it’s a problem or you won’t and you’ll be fine or you’ll die of alcohol related issues. 

I don’t know you or your life, but the way you responded sounds exactly how I responded when someone told me I was an addict. Spoiler alert: a year later, I came to figure out that he was right."

As long as I knew I had a problem, it didn't matter that everyone was invalidating my experience. I literally had a sociology professor shut me down and embarrass me in front of the whole class for saying that marijuana is addictive. Idc anymore. If someone doesn't get it or makes fun of me or says something rude, oh well. I'm sober and grateful and that's all I care about. Addictions ruin lives. Period.

addiction,f7jjsvu,t3_dwbs4k,1573779171.0,"I was addicted to weed for about four years. The last year or two got very very dark. My life went to absolute shit. I joined r/leaves and started going to AA. Really I went there because it was the strongest 12 step fellowship here and I just substituted weed in my head when I spoke about my “alcohol” addiction. I’ve been sober since June 18th, 2018. No THC or anything else since then. 

Really this is what I needed to get me sober. You may need both or neither or something else like rehab, a counselor, etc. I am in therapy to this day and started antidepressants. Hope you find something that works. Feel free to post to r/leaves and ask others how they did it! No matter how dark things are now, there is hope. Feel free to check out my one year post on r/leaves in my post history where I go into more detail about where my addiction took me. 

Feel free to message me any time."

EDAnonymous,f7db8ru,t3_dvaov0,1573612274.0,"When my ED was at its worst I was constantly judging others in my head. What they ate, how they acted, what they looked like. The foods they picked, the way they chewed, whether they were eating more or less than me or faster or slower. I could accurately tell you anyone's size just by looking at them. It was a constant calculation in my head of other people's weight, height, and clothing size. It was maddening and I couldn't stop.

Nowadays I can look at people and not obsessively think these things about them. I don't obsessively take my measurements or weigh myself either. I no longer take ""progress"" pictures and check the mirror every 20 minutes in fear that I've miraculously gained 50 pounds.

My life isn't fueled by fear and judgment anymore. Fat people don't bother me anymore, because it's not my life and it doesn't affect me, and all that judgment ever did was make me miserable. I'm not 100% better but I'm better, and if I could get better, even though I was so severely obsessed and messed up, you can too. x"

It really really hurt when I was younger. One time I asked my mom why she did it and she gave me some generic “well at this point I just kind of expect it from you.” Now that I’m older I just see the true shittiness of it all and it doesn’t bother me as much as we’re not in contact."
