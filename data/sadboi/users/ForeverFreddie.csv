Shows preference for some by disregarding the rules of the debate for some, while ignoring others or shutting them down? The same media that asks the worst questions in order to get a rise out the audience and the candidates for them to get those sweet ratings and sound bites for later use? Let‚Äôs not get into how disrespectful the audience is, you‚Äôd swear you were watching the finale of a reality tv show. 

News networks should not run the debates period. They only care about how much ad revenue they can generate through ratings. They‚Äôre as biased as they come. That‚Äôs what happens when news stops being a loss leader for media outlets and is expected to generate revenue. 

The best scenario for debates is to have a 3rd party host and moderate then, such as The League of Women Voters had before 1988 when the RNC and DNC decided to move to network television. It would behoove us all to create and independent non-partisan organization that could host and moderate the debate instead of the networks, should people view The League as a partisan entity. This way you ensure little to no bias. The exclusion of an audience, which would allow candidates to be able to debate their positions and policies without having to worry about audience participation or being pit against each other for ratings. Rules would be better able to be enforced, and allow for the public to become better informed about the candidates running. It‚Äôs time to end the reality tv show circus that our current debate system has fallen prey to."

I digress however, if people are that uncomfortable with them, it‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility that a committee can be created and be filled with non-partisan parties to host and run the debates going forward. 


Both the RNC and the DNC had no issues allowing the League to run the debates before they decided to allow media to run them. It‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility that they would allow them to be ran by them again. If anything at least the DNC can turn away from having the networks, who only care for ratings run them and restore integrity to the process. Candidates get a space where they can actually talk about their issues and voters get to actually listen and be better informed"

Many conservatives have been effectively kicked out of their party. They aren‚Äôt going to vote for trump no matter what. Centralism isn‚Äôt the problem.

They have no cohesive or united message. Republicans no matter where they are always have the same message. Democrats do not. Democrats war with one another and provide their base with a stupid amount of policies while Republicans create a simple message to get into office and mold the nation in their image. democrats can‚Äôt seem to realize that the common enemy is the GOP and not each other. The GOP has been playing the long game, and this is why we are in the position we find ourselves in. The GOP is masterful in how it can get its base to vote in droves. Democrats cant even turn out young voters or inspire non voters to vote. This just creates a cycle of apathy among the base and leads to the infighting that is ravaging the party.

Trump now has a huge obstacle in front of him, he did not want Biden as the nominee. He straight up gave people at his last rally the game plan for his re-election.
