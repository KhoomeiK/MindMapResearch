Games,f8fxl1t,t3_e0n15x,1574550905.0,"I think it's a perfectly good game. It's reminding me of the B-tier games that you don't get anymore. Not encountered any bugs that I would consider bad, but tonnes of little things that would normally polished out in the last 3-4 months of development. 

Things like being able to take damage when the game locks you into an animation without my explicit permission. BD-1's health indicator turning on and off as you go through the squeezing parts. The time you have to hold down the button to travel to worlds is way to long and I think its strange how that controls been mapped. The default mapping for going down whist climbing is different to swimming. The padiwans hair is great fun to watch as it flies across the room. 

Then there are some design decisions that I question. Like giving some bosses moves that can stun lock you, and take you down from full health to death before you've seen the move for the first time. Why do some crates need to be spliced when the player is guaranteed to have that ability when they reach that area? Why show so much info on the map (which is hard to read) but then also not add things like crates or other stuff I would like to see. The environmental design could be a wee bit clearer sometimes, and I almost always don't see cracks in the wall. No fast travel at the point I'm at sucks and has stopped me returning to areas that I would have done if this was a more classic metroidvania style game. 

My biggest complaint is the performance. I'm playing on PC with something that defaulted to epic settings. The load stuttering is annoying and constant, I don't know if any of the settings I have changed have impacted that at all. But putting things like render distance and shadows down a couple of notches ruins the visuals. If you're running PC build then I would highly recommend keeping these on high and changing other settings if you need to.

While these are all complaints I'm still having a great time overall. It's one of the few games I've actually been okay about recommending to others, which is unusual for me. The two thinks that really put me off the game at reveal was the animations and combat looks poor, borderline unserviceable. The gameplay animations have improved dramatically since the launch, and the combat works. Each planets sandbox feels unique. Individual enemies are fun to fight, learning about each one, how they interact with others, their tells, their strengths and weaknesses, and then executing on a plan has provided a good loop that ends just as I think I'm getting a proper handle on each enemy type.

The story has been a standout for me though. Cal and Cere are a great duo to have and the first twist that is revealed I think was one of the best I've ever seen, game or otherwise. Provides a good twist that wasn't clearly broadcast, made perfect sense, characters reacted to it naturally and in an very interesting way, and I just liked it. It's what's really pulling me though and I've heard the ending is wild. I'm just past the ""fall of the hero"" part of the Hero's Journey structure and already planning on picking up the sequel if it ever gets greenlit. For star wars fans I think this is a must get as long as you are okay with modern game controls, failing that have a friend or a partner to help when you need it."

An old example is how they rendered the reflections in Super Mario 64. Modern graphical hardware has been designed to make these tricks efficient to compute, and rendering tech has been designed to take advantage of what this hardware does well.

Ray tracing mimics how light/sound rays/rays propergate in the real world to produce more realistic effects. Sending out thousands of beams out from the camera that then bounce around the game world taking the properties of what they interact with. Which is how we see rays from the sun, just reversed to make things more efficient. 

This has been done in CGI for a long time now but has typically been reserved for prerendering stuff like movies as they can tell each ray to bounce around hundreds-thousands of times before they produce one frame. This is why it can take movies like Toy Story 4 30 hours to render one frame. While a game wants to render a frame every 33.3 ms. 

Ray tracing has been possible in real time for a while but as I mentioned graphical hardware has been tuned to make traditional rendering methods be fast in real time. Having dedicated ray tracing hardware makes real time ray tracing much more feasible as that's what it's designed to do well. While it won't be up to snuff with pre rendered snuff, as a game may be limited to 100 rays with bounces limited to a maximum of 8 bounces. But programmers are smart, we can be selective with how it's used, and it can be used in conjunction with trational graphical rendering to produce great result."

I can highly suggest (for you and others) learning a new skill in your spare time instead of passively watching videos. If at all possible doing learning in a group setting. It will help with a slightly stale social life, learning something new is great in itself, it might help in career progression (or at the very least be something you can talk about in entry-level career interviews), and will give a bit more variety in your life.

I find it very helpful to set micro-goals when doing something new. I think that modern western childhood conditions people to a much shorter feedback loop in terms of time from effort to payout. Learning to play a new musical instrument takes time, but nailing a scale consistently is a much smaller goal, that helps you stay motivated.  

Discipline is also a skill that you can learn and improve over time that you can measure progress with micro-goals."

See forth and fifth [definitions of genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide?wprov=sfla1). Then read stories about ICE, to make up your own mind... but here's one from [The Guardian.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/31/us-immigration-detention-centers-pregnant-migrant-women). I couldn't find the story about the couple of cases (and it was just one or two) where women were very clearly being treated in a way that would purposely increase the changes of a miscarage. Whether you can link that to the 'certain group' part of the definition I'm not sure about, but detainees are all supposed to be 'Non-US Citizens'"

After 22 months the phone broke I sent it off for repairs with Vodafone who refused to fix it. Turns out that they messed up the phone pretty bad as it had puncture marks, broken glass, metal hanging off, and more issues. I complained on Twitter and they ended up giving me a Sony Xperia that is utterly shit, didn't match any of the specs I asked for, but I got it for free. Now have a regular income and phone that I hate (but is functional) but only costs me 0.5% of my salary before tax. Not sure why I'm even paying that much. Have unlimited texts + 500 minutes whist I only sent 5 texts and 40 minutes this month which is pretty heavy useage for me 😅"
