traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,f6vqaak,t3_dt0w4h,1573195476.0,"Ugh, my theater teacher just said this yesterday: ""Ladies, gentlemen..... uh, and THEM! .... Did I do that right?""

And then of course the other nonbinary person in the room who uses they/them pronouns told her that she was fine in saying that because ""It's the spirit!"" ðŸ™„ All the while, I'm making meaningful eye contact with the nonbinary person in the room who uses she/they pronouns like ""reaaaally?!"""
bipolar,f3aggl5,t1_f3ag2nq,1570772246.0,"Not going to lie, this was one of the most anxiety-ridden things I've ever done. I wrote an initial draft (over 900 words) over several hours last night, edited it for an hour today, and agonized a bit about posting it... but I had planned this for a couple months (and trimmed my facebook friends list a month ago in preparation!) and was pretty determined that I was going to be the first out-as-bipolar person I knew on campus. I've received lots of positivity both in the comments and via PMs, and only one slightly-insensitive remark... which I'm luckily hypomanic enough to pretty much ignore. I'm so relieved and happy that I did it :)"
UnsentLetters,ev3ry1r,t1_ev3qdrm,1564200644.0,"It's been four years, and I've made my peace with it. I just wish my mom would acknowledge the impact that this (and other things) had on me growing up, and stop pretending like she's a flawless mother."
AmItheAsshole,eund6l4,t3_ch0hkd,1563927270.0,"ESH. Your professor sucks because he should have assigned a more manageable project that could be completed using what you learned in class. You suck because you should have gone to office hours or emailed him about this, and asked if you could copy from online sources, before going ahead and doing that yourself. If your professor's policy is to not allow copying of other people's code (which is the case in most CS classes), and you turn the project in without admitting that you copied code, that's academic dishonesty."
AmItheAsshole,euj15rw,t3_cgnjf5,1563859923.0,"NTA. You have a right to privacy.

My mom did that to me in my freshman year of college, and also somehow bugged my phone so that I couldn't prevent her from tracking me. To this day I still don't know how she managed to get my own phone to take photos of me without my knowledge and send them to her. (She'd send me the photos later, asking me where I was in this photo and that photo. Creepy as fuck.) I ended up buying a new phone with my own money, switching service providers, paying for my own phone bills, and even changing my number and not telling her my new number for several months.

Just want to warn you that this is within the realm of possibility, depending on how much of a control freak your mother is."
AmItheAsshole,eucw8mn,t1_eucvrz5,1563689330.0,"Yeah, she used to be a bit annoyed that I did it, but didn't tell me to stop doing it. (The whole ""theater is demonic"" thing came later.) I've always played down my theater involvement, to the point of hiding two whole productions from her, but I didn't think I had to hide everything. Now she's totally anti-theater all of a sudden and has decided that no theater involvement is appropriate. Well, I guess it's time to go completely underground with my theater activities."
AmItheAsshole,eucvc8t,t1_eucuz6m,1563688267.0,"She used to be more okay with me doing theater - I didn't know she was *this* anti-theater until recently.  I haven't told her anything at all about my fall plans, but now she is demanding to see what classes I'm registered for.

Yeah, I will probably end up secretly auditing classes and not telling her about plays that I do."
AmItheAsshole,eucuj7j,t1_eucu1n1,1563687358.0,"I am really confused by all the people saying ""she doesn't want to pay for a specific major."" It's not as if I'll stop taking physics classes?? The tuition is literally the same whether I take theater classes or not. True, I could graduate in fewer semesters were I not taking theater classes, but my parents have also specifically told me to **not** take fewer semesters. They want me to take eight and exactly eight semesters. This does not change whether I add on an extra major or not. I know for a fact that I'll be able to finish in eight semesters even with a theater double major.

I wouldn't be pissed if my mom said ""no theater major for you."" What I *am* pissed about is that she said ""no theater classes and no plays whatsoever.""

Sidenote: I'm not terribly particular on pronouns but I prefer they/them."
AmItheAsshole,euctunu,t1_euctm1j,1563686604.0,"Good advice! The local theater scene is pretty intense in my area, but it might just be time to step out of my comfort zone and wade into that."
AmItheAsshole,euctl4l,t1_euctcmr,1563686314.0,"Yeah, I cut this from my post for length, but I've lied about my theater involvement before, and even successfully hidden two entire production from her. I may just end up not taking more theater classes, but doing plays on the side and not telling her."
AmItheAsshole,euct4v4,t1_eucsiji,1563685835.0,"I mean, it's a private university and you don't pay for individual classes; tuition is fixed. And basically her stance is ""no theater at all"" so I wouldn't even be able to do plays with a theater club.

Also, I'd still be getting a physics degree in the normal four years.

Yeah I guess the emotional blackmail might be an asshole move on my part but that's the language she speaks."
AmItheAsshole,eucsssv,t1_eucsmju,1563685483.0,"Yeah, I know I'm entitled. It's true that one of the main reasons I'm still on speaking terms with my parents is that they're paying for my education. If they weren't, I would have cut off contact as soon as I graduated high school."
AmItheAsshole,eucso0s,t1_eucsfll,1563685345.0,We never really had a formal agreement; it was just understood that my parents would be paying. I've been a STEM nerd since elementary school so my theater passion was totally unforeseen by anyone.
AmItheAsshole,eucskre,t1_eucsea0,1563685252.0,Private university - tuition remains fixed and is not determined by classes. You do bring up a valid point that I could offer to pay for part of my tuition - maybe that would sway her.
AmItheAsshole,eucsha1,t1_eucs8jo,1563685151.0,"I mean, I guess it's not really even about the double major. It's the fact that she won't let me do any plays at all, or take any classes. The classes I could do without, but I feel like I would die emotionally inside if I were not allowed to do any acting for two years."
