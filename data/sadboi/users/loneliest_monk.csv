GTA6,fn4ukdl,t3_fyu8yd,1586649292.0,"I’m replaying San Andreas and I prefer it to V. There was so much complexity to the world and it’s elements. GTA 6 needs to bring back those rpg elements (gym, eating, other stats) that made early 2000s games so popular, while incorporating the atmosphere of the earlier titles. V veered away from what made GTA games so popular in the name of pleasing casual action game fans. Let’s hope 6 can bring back that serious tone while still honoring the quirkiness of the universe."

Anxiety,fll3ybd,t3_fpfm4w,1585253172.0,You’re not too paranoid. Me and the wife get into this argument a lot. I’d rather them all stay in the house (I’m essential so I don’t get a choice in the matter) but she’s hellbent on being out every possible second. My off days are the only days I can truly self-isolate and that’s when she wants to plan family outings. Smh.
Anxiety,fkufmmi,t1_fkrx38s,1584548521.0,"I’ve also noticed that people with anxiety can develop a sort of acid reflux when eating and acid reflux can produce a dry cough because you feel all of your food sitting on your chest. Between allergy season and acid reflux, I literally convince myself I have COVID everyday, even though I avoid all crowds, wear masks at work and compulsively wash my hands."
Anxiety,fkuegy6,t3_fkayil,1584547888.0,"I’m so thankful for this thread. Let’s me know I’m not alone. I work in a grocery store. It’s super dusty which makes my voice hoarse and keeps me coughing all day, it’s also a constant 45 degrees which sends us all home sniffly and shivering after each shift. I’ve developed an intense case of acid reflux as a result of my poor eating and anxiety, so I literally leave work with chills, a cough, and chest pains everyday. It’s soo stressful, but when I’m home, I’m fine. I’m hoping my store gets shut down because there’s way more than 250 people that cram in there at a time."

thewalkingdead,ez3xhqb,t1_ez3l48q,1567677170.0,"Even with that, I just don’t buy the timeline. Season 6 opens with the quarry and while they discovered it rather quickly after the events of season 5 it appeared that they took their time preparing to confront it.  (Built provisions, trained alexandrians in combat) They also appeared to be more established in the community. The events of the first half of season 6 took place over the span of 2 days in which we found out Maggie was pregnant, but we know that there was a month time jump in between Carl getting shot and Rick and Daryl meeting Jesus. Meaning from that point until the end of the war, another 4 months had to have passed. On TOP of all the additional time it would have taken for them to deal with the hunters and travel from GA to VA during the apocalypse."
thewalkingdead,ez0nk7s,t1_eyy9rda,1567639353.0,I believe it takes place in under 6 months(some women don’t show even up to that point in pregnancy) but 3 weeks is ridiculous-even with the split/bottle episodes.  I feel like Daryl was tortured for at least 3 weeks
thewalkingdead,ez0mgp5,t3_cytakp,1567638901.0,"I just can’t see rick and Carl traveling on foot to safety, Carl nursing a hurt Rick back to health, reuniting with michonne, running into the marauders and Daryl on the road, reconnecting with the rest of the group, walking to terminus, getting kidnapped, getting saved, finding the church, surviving the hunters, searching for Beth, leaving for VA(all the back roads and gassing up and rummaging they must’ve had to do), surviving the storm, meeting Aaron, going to Alexandria, spending time getting acclimated, Noah’s death, Reggie’s death, the season 6 premiere (which felt like it came after a brief time jump,) all in 3months."
