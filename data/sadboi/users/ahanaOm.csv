depression,ewpx9b4,t1_ewpx2t4,1565651519.0,"Don’t push yourself to be happy . Some days are bad for everyone .
Once in a while spend time with family . With old friends . Siblings or cousins . 
Not to make yourself happy but to make others happy ."
depression,ewpx0ed,t3_cpilnx,1565651347.0,"What you feel now .... it’s a feeling .... I have been there and done things to feel better . But now after 3 na half years of learning .... I finally understood how to get things together . 
I don’t know if this will help but do try it ...
1. Try something new . Could be a new hair cut or a new cuisine or a new restaurant or even trying out yoga . Something small and easy but something new . 
2. Try and make big travel plans . One that needs so much of planing and saving and consumes a lot of thinking . Like if you live in London plan a trip to Vietnam . Or india . Someplace where you can’t just leave instantly . Keeping your mind occupied helps a lot with feeling bored and low .
3. Stop using Instagram and facebook when you feel low . Instead watch a movie ( happy types ) or a scifi movie . 
4. Next time you are outside .. observe people who seems happy . Like how long they smile or laugh . How crooked is their teeth . Observing others can teach you to look closer at other people and you will learn a whole different way of looking a happiness .
Please let me know after you try this for a week .
Anyways you have given up . You can do this for me . What can you loose .

Eagerly waiting ."
depression,ewpw1it,t3_cpa2dl,1565650683.0,"First of all a tight hug .... you made it this far ..
I know you must have tried eveything to get over this . 
I tried them too . What finally worked was trying not to fight it . 
Learning ways to keep things under control ...
But what will always help us sharing how you feel with others . 
Please keep talking to others and always try to do one good thing for someone no matter how small and donit without expecting anything in return . 

Please feel free to talk to me if you need someone who will just listen to you . 

No one is alone in the world . You just haven’t tried enough ."
depression,ewpvhuq,t3_cpfejw,1565650309.0,"I’m sorry you feel that way and I have felt the same too. 
I though if I didn’t wake up it would be so much better . 
One of my friend passed away in a car crash and I was with her friends and family . 
That made me realise how much death of one person effect so many others . 
Next time you feel this way , thing of how your parents would feel . Your siblings , each of your friends and family. 
Think of how hard it will be for them to overcome this and to accept it . 
When you think of the misery it will bring to your loved ones and the depression it wil being to them , you will eventually stop thinking of it .
And also what sort of helped me was that I always though of how lonely and sad my husband would feel if I died being married to him . And I didn’t want him to think that me giving up meant I didn’t love him . So think of your closest ones .
Hope you will feel a little better everyday and come to a point where you forget you were even depressed . 
It’s one step at a time ."
depression,ewpv2fg,t3_cpesdl,1565650020.0,"Doing activities together with loved ones can show that you are not alone and they love you and wants you t be better . 
Not everyone might have the words to make you feel better . 
Cooking together might be your moms way of showing her concerns to you .
Try and do the same with other people in your life and you will see how much better it makes you feel ."
depression,ewpuxh9,t1_ewpu2fv,1565649925.0,Ouch !! But praying is sort of meditation and she might have a remedie there .
depression,ewputki,t3_cp8u1c,1565649852.0,"One of the main problems faced is that a spouse or partner or parents or friends do not understand you and hence cannot support you . 
There are so many educative videos on YouTube that you can share with your loved ones as starters . So they get a small idea .
Second step ( what I did ) is text my spouse when I felt low . 
Because talking felt way too emotional . Try and text the person what you feel even if they are sitting right next to you . 
And always text them of how you feel . Never mention “you” instead always say “I” .
Let them know when you are low cause sometimes they tend to not notice ."
depression,ewpuf1t,t1_ewmttwy,1565649576.0,"I felt the same way for a long time . The truth is most of the people do not understand how exactly we feel inside . In fact most of the time we ourselves can’t figure it out . The key as per my experience is to understand is not put someone else in pressure . Meditation helps for some . But sometimes I find that Netflix with some pizza or ice cream is equally good . 
The answer is that we do not fit In because we are way too emotional to try an fit with them.
When we feel uncomfortable. Do any of the following 
1. If it’s a close person , tell them that you feel a little low so you are going to do something else to keep yourself distracted .
2. Try to talk about things that interests you .
3. Try and meditate ( or cook , eat , whatever is your thing) 
4. Make your screensaver your happiest picture ( of yourself or someone you love ) and every time you feel uncomfortable or as if you don’t fit it , look at it ."
