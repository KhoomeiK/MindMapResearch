RantsFromRetail,fpt7cyr,t3_gfdpof,1588886150.0,“HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW YOU WERE AT THE OTHER REGISTER?!” how do you stop yourself from immediately saying “because i’m fucking standing here?”

RantsFromRetail,fnlx2fu,t1_fnlkwg2,1587061233.0,my register doesn’t even have 20s in it in the mornings and i have people trying to pay for their breakfast protein bar with 100s
RantsFromRetail,fnkaam6,t1_fnjakwd,1587019886.0,the thing that bothers me the most about this is... find someone on the fucking floor. in that fucking department. when you were shopping there. why wait until they get to the checkout line to ask if we have something in stock and hold up my lines waiting for the product because you refuse to use common sense??

BPD,fbcycii,t3_ecjw8s,1576738331.0,"Yooooooo YES. This is happening to me right now. Boyfriend randomly dropped off the face of the earth for a weekend and I freaked, turns out his depression was acting up. No matter how many times he assured me it was nothing I did I can’t stop convincing myself that he’s getting ready to leave me"
BPD,faoqv96,t1_fao2hp1,1576270511.0,"Same, it happens with my boyfriend more often than anyone else. He’s also just really bad at texting as communication. It’s really frustrating but at least there’s a part of my brain reminding me that it doesn’t make sense to get mad at him all the time about it"
BPD,faauh3a,t1_faaop18,1575913687.0,"Exactly^^ OP I get into those ups and downs too, exactly like you’ve described. Recently I’ve tried to start framing it in my head like “it’s okay if you take a small chunk of time to yourself, like a few hours to just chill, everybody needs time to themselves.” That reminder makes it easy to think later on what if I just did one small thing I was talking about? Like did my laundry instead of cleaning the whole house, for example."
ItTheMovie,f8x15je,t3_e2pjwp,1574905436.0,This is phenomenal!! I’d definitely pay for this.

TwoXChromosomes,f48yu70,t1_f48xol0,1571452715.0,Thanks dude. I really needed to hear that.
TwoXChromosomes,f4655gb,t1_f454zxm,1571404210.0,"I’ve had this weird no-symptoms thing pretty much since I was born. I’ve ran a fever once in my life when I was a baby, whenever I would get strep they would say I didn’t have it during the exam and then the test would come back positive. It got so bad I had to get my tonsils taken out. It’s like my body doesn’t feel anything until it’s debilitating and then it’s like “oh right” and does extra everything all at once"
TwoXChromosomes,f423eoa,t1_f40a5iv,1571326979.0,"It’s actually not as great as you’d think lol. People have told me the itchiness and burning suck, but I’m limping around because this node is so tender, I can’t stand for too long and I’m a cashier, plus the symptoms that I’m having are flu-like so I’m getting a fever and body aches. I feel like it’s a toss-up lol"
TwoXChromosomes,f422zef,t1_f3ylp5k,1571326836.0,"Oh god, did you ever find out why it was so frequent? Or was it just a thing that was happening?"
velvethippos,f1f7x2p,t3_d93ele,1569438642.0,The best surprise!!
2meirl4meirl,evdwai1,t3_cji32d,1564449126.0,Hard same. Sorry dude. I hope it gets better.
AskReddit,eoojlgu,t3_bshgdx,1558740156.0,"I don’t think I want to finish school but I’m terrified to tell my mom or anyone else. She’s stood by me through all the time and money I wasted fucking up in school because of mental illness. I’m afraid she’ll be so disappointed in me. I’ve also planned huge events in my life around school. If I don’t finish, it’s like.. I don’t know what to do."
