Story time:

I got stung when I was like 2, and my parents separated when I was about that age too and they hated each other after that. This is relevant -- Mom's always been afraid of bees because a nest fell on her when she was a kid, so whenever I was scared of any bees or wasps and I was at my dad's, he blamed it on my mom and tried to ""condition"" me to grow out of it. 

One time when I was about 6 he made me sit outside on the patio for like two hours with a bunch of wasp nests overhead in the ceiling (he was a hoarder and didn't give a fuck about his property tbh), with wasps coming and going constantly â€“ forced me to sit out there and learn not to be afraid of them, they weren't going to touch me if I didn't fuck with them, etc. I remember sitting there listening to my walkman, staring at the picnic table blankly, just shivering and sweating with fear, trying not to cry. I couldn't concentrate on anything but what if one landed on me or near me, then what would I do? I think that's what made it an actual phobia because it was so fucking traumatic."

* [Vegetarians and vegans make up approximately 8% of the world's population](https://wtvox.com/sustainable-living/2019-the-world-of-vegan-but-how-many-vegans-are-in-the-world/)
* [15% of the world's population are Hindu (don't eat pork or beef)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_by_country)
* [24% are muslim (don't eat pork)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/)
* Jews don't eat pork either but they're a relatively small population (~14 million) and the above figures will have some people who are pretty lax about their religion, so I won't include this stat. Not being antisemetic here â€“ I'm part Jewish â€“ it's just easier for my quick 5 minute stats.
* An estimated 6-7% of the world's population may be gluten intolerant â€“ [based off of US statistics](https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-people-have-gluten-sensitivity-562965)
* [1% of people worldwide have celiac disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3264942/)

So many people have broken down into tears in front of me over the last few weeks, not to mention the growing hostility. I have to patrol by myself because management refuse to pair me with another person. It costs too much. If someone comes up behind me and cracks me in the head, it's over. I could be lying on the sidewalk for hours bleeding out and no one would care because I'm the one who issued them a parking fine last week. I'm the one taking their grocery money this week.

Just because your kids know what it looks like doesn't mean other kids do -- and it may help them realize that they need help. And that's a good thing, too. Stop shitting on people who choose to openly discuss their mental illness. You're free to stay as quiet as you like, that's your prerogative, but I broadcast this shit on the off chance it'll help someone. Whether it does, I'll never know, but what I do know is staying quiet will never help anybody except yourself."

>No - young people donâ€™t vote because they are lazy and have better things to do than vote. It has nothing to do with gas lighting . Adults are gaslighted by politicians too- we still go out and vote.

That's a direct attack on today's youth. You say ""we"" when referring to adults, so we know you're talking about the present day. Don't try to play stupid when someone calls you out on your bullshit. 

Apathy (not laziness) is one reason why ANYONE chooses not to vote.

That said, there are people actively making it more difficult for college students and minorities to vote. That coupled with the fact that elections are held on Tuesdays during business hours, makes it difficult for people who have working class jobs to actually get to the polls. Classism is a huge issue when it comes to this and unfortunately young people and minorities often fall into the lower income end of the spectrum. This makes it harder for them to get to the polls. Just one reason of many in a house of cards stacked against the working class."

That is, if voting amongst the ""youth"" has been a problem since the 1970s like you're claiming. Maybe stop attacking a single generation for a problem that spans multiple generations, and actually try to come up with a solution."

AskReddit,fldiai5,t3_fo40gu,1585065087.0,"My parents separated when I was a toddler, but both were well off with ~$1mil houses, mom had a six figure income, dad only worked a couple months out of the year doing government projects. I primarily lived with my mom though. For reference, we had a housekeeper. 

When I was a teenager, my granddad came to live with me and mom. No one else in our family cared except for my mom, so she took care of him until he passed a couple years later. That's when her brothers sued her for allegedly misusing his estate. She signed checks to herself for his expenses by agreement with him, which I witnessed, but that wasn't good enough for the judge -- so we lost almost everything. Had to move house after near-foreclosure, I transferred schools, she had to file no-contact orders against her brothers because they started harassing us after that, touting victory, etc. Stole things of his, too. Said that we'd be living in a cardboard box by the time they were done. 

Things got so bad that she took a leave of absence from her work due to severe depression and never went back -- instead she wound up having to find work at a fuel station 5 years later (lived off her 401k until then) because no one else would hire her due to age. When I got into high school I had to get a job to help support us. I remember one year we got a thanksgiving food basket donated to us by the church, and another year she was denied unemployment. I skipped meals to save money, tried to reframe it as a new diet plan because I was chubby and developed an eating disorder. I put my college plans on hold to work to help support her as she was getting older, but lucked out getting a job that came with discounted tuition so I finally got my degree by the time I turned 25.

My dad developed Alzheimer's and was scammed out of his fortune by a contractor. We reported the contractor to APS and the police but dad's finances were such a mess that I couldn't handle untangling the web with my own mental health already suffering. I was his only relative nearby when he was being taken advantage of and I was just 19 at the time, so there was a lot of guilt from that which I'm still trying to get over 10 years later. My sister (half sister) is his caregiver.

So I guess my life has been a rollercoaster, like... 0-13yo upper class, 13-22 poverty, 23-29 (now) middle class by sheer luck tbh. Things are looking okay. Well, aside from coronavirus and the impending Great Depression, but hey, at least I have toilet paper."
