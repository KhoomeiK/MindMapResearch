You're welcome"
alcoholicsanonymous,fo2mz8t,t1_fo2bz9x,1587468328.0,Thank you! What is grapevine may I ask?
FoodPorn,fo0etqt,t1_fo016e9,1587411829.0,This is about 98% similar to the Sri Lankan Caramel pudding. Looks yum!
BPD,fnhxgzf,t1_fnhwn5s,1586970483.0,"That's not the case at all. I honestly think he has it worse than me, if we must go there. I'm actually at a better place now. What pissed me off was he shutting me down when I tried to share a moment with him. But now that I've calmed down from when I wrote this post, I understand that I was being so self absorbed at that time cause that's my usual defense mechanism to look out for myself cause nobody ever did that for me."
BPD,fnhwipn,t1_fnhuke1,1586970029.0,"What made me mad was that he just threw a ""same"" at me when I tried to share a moment with him, which I don't do often. He casually shares songs with me all the time and I know the minute when he wants to initiate a conversation about something that he wants to talk about cause I observe and sense every move he makes. And I was mad that he never does."
BPD,fnhubj3,t1_fnhtae4,1586968975.0,"It's actually the opposite of that. I got mad cause he actually gets me and still he chose to throw a ""same"" when i tried to share a moment with him."
BPD,fnhu088,t1_fnhaff3,1586968821.0,"No i guess you're the first person who actually gave me an answer. I was acting impulsively when i wrote this post and now that I've calmed down, i understand that what pissed me off was he shutting me down with a ""same"" when i tried to share a moment. And honestly, i can't blame it on him either cause he's never gonna magically know what goes in my head and what I'm about to do. Thank you for the reality check."
BPD,fnhtcaj,t1_fnhi4wr,1586968494.0,"Maybe you got me wrong. I really don't wanna be the ""special one"". I don't wanna be like this, trust me. What pissed me off was that I shared a moment with him (and I rarely ever do), and when I did that he just slapped me with a ""same"" than just hearing me out. That's what pissed me off. Also I acknowledge and validate his feelings more than anybody else."
BPD,fnhsoy8,t1_fnhcqil,1586968175.0,YES! YES!! YES!!!
BPD,fnh8qmq,t1_fnh45vb,1586957505.0,He knows me so well and I do too. And I know he's got some issues as well but we're so different like that and he knows it. That's why it irritated me so much.
BPD,fnh80y7,t1_fngzo22,1586957054.0,"That's the thing, he knows everything about me and he knows how different everything is for me. I know I was irrational at the time but I can't help but fall into this cycle of thinking that he doesn't even try to genuinely understand me."
BPD,fngzl29,t1_fngszzw,1586950571.0,"I get you. What people don't understand is that what we go through is completely different and we simply don't know how else to describe it oyher than the typical way. We might say ""I'm down"" but what it actually means is ""HOLY SHIT I'M FALLING DOWN A DARK RABBIT HOLE AND I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA GET PARALYZED AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP! PLEASE HELP!"". So it's very fair to get mad when the other person says ""same""."
BPD,fngs2bc,t3_g1o3p2,1586942845.0,"I've been wondering the same thing for years. Apparently it has a pretty simple explanation according to my therapist. When our inside and outside worlds don't match, we get confused and we try to make sense of it, sometimes aggressively. There's a lot going on in your head, but your life outside your head is comparatively fine. So you try to make that inside pain tangible by creating and inflicting some kind of a pain on yourself, by yourself. It makes you feel relieved that pain is now tangible and visible to you. Also the act itself is more of a release.

I've been clean from self harm for about 8 months now, and yet I struggle with staying clean. Therapy and good friends have helped me a lot. I hope you find that support soon. ‚ù§"
BPD,fngp5f8,t1_fngnd0v,1586939787.0,"I know that feeling. It feels like there's nothing to hold onto anymore. And I guess you've tried to move on from your mistakes but the people and life that surround you keep reminding you of everything that went wrong. I don't know you but I can say that moving on for you is long overdue. But even if you don't have a reason to believe it will ever get better, what if it does tomorrow? I don't want you to miss out on the other side of this, and believe me when I say this, it's worth the pain. Stay strong fam ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
BPD,fnglzrg,t3_g1mges,1586936615.0,"No you're not. You're just someone who's tired of being under the weight of your own actions, which you allowed yourself to indulge in that feeling of ""living in the moment"". That guilt has taken over you and you've been blinded by it. But trust me, you're every bit of precious as anyone who walks this earth. Your brain is lying to you. It doesn't let you see the other side of the bridge. True you've fallen to the rock bottom. But the good thing is when you're there, the only way to go is up! Stay strong. I'll be thinking of you ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
weddingring,fn6v9ha,t1_fn4bjr2,1586708028.0,"That's why I started with ""unpopular opinion"". What really matters is if you're completely in love with your ring. I'm so glad you found yours and congratulations! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"

BPD,f36vtdk,t1_f33oxxn,1570718241.0,"YES! YES! YES!!!!!

It's been going on for days now. I feel too numb and empty to even feel depressed. It's like I'm a hollowed out bottle. Everything I try to pour in, goes right out. Nothing stays."
BPD,f36vbuh,t1_f33i8tc,1570718058.0,"It makes perfect sense! I also play some metal on spotify when I find it hard to concentrate on one specific thing alone. But as of now I've gotten so worse that reading your comment + replying took me a good whole 10 minutes to get done. Anyway, imma go see my therapist tomorrow :) thanks for leaning in to help <3"
