MakeupAddiction,fppo0pn,t1_fppme1q,1588805849.0,You are consistently downvoted in most subreddits you frequent. Think on that. You taking a weird high road in an effort to appear in control of the conversation doesn't change that.
MakeupAddiction,fpplqz0,t1_fppkjat,1588804627.0,"You are entirely too pressed about this. You know men post here all the time too, right? Your lack of knowledge isn't because of your gender. It's not necessary to add."

Makeup,fphl56i,t1_fphkpf3,1588623201.0,"I can relate!! I will not start if someone is in the room...at all. It feels like dressing myself up for the day, it's like a private thing for me. To be honest I am super new to actually doing looks and trying to keep them on instead of wiping them off immediately and I'm still learning so I feel the ""I look ridiculous"" feeling with every look I do...only just recently made a look my pfp, and it was so scary. It feels like it's not really me because I still never wear makeup."

OP, I hope you're doing ok"

That would be an impressive *sounding* statement to say it emulates all of them, heh"
