RomanceBooks,fp07ubs,t3_gak3i4,1588204109.0,"I kinda get it. Yes you are young. I felt this way when I was that age, I wasn't reading romance back then. I found moving through life you meet different people and some guys are gross and some are great.

Currently I read a lot of romance/erotic novels and I've tried to separate them from love in reality. As fiction is so, because it's not based on exact reality. 
Of recent I have explained to the bf why I enjoy aspects in the fiction I read and he has listened and pondered them.

Hope that helps. X"

When i turned 18 and moved out of my family house i did the same thing. went a bit sex crazy. I felt wanted and worthy, it gave me excitement. Also on a basic level release happy chemicals which made feel good. After getting into my first serious relationship, I realized that having that friendship etc as well as the sex was sooooo much more fullfilling. Also, I know its hard but try not to what would have happened that won't help IMO. Go from where you are know.
