I used to be a voice and accent trainer in the Philippines, and your delivery suggests that you are Filipino (possibly from Metro Manila).  

Filipinos are pretty good when it comes to American English. When trying to improve, however, most Filipinos focus on grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. These are definitely important, but not enough attention is given to intonation. Knowing which syllable to stress (e.g., ""address"" used as a noun versus as a verb), as well as the ability to use the appropriate intonation pattern for a question (as opposed to, say, a command) would help a lot in terms of clarity."
