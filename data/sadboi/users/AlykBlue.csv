BPD,erl4mo4,t1_erkwwlk,1560978178.0,"I've been on zoloft since forever, but as far as treatment goes I'm still in the early stages right now. Living in a country where english isn't the main language so finding a therapist is HARD. 
I've had to train myself in CBT and DBT techniques for the most part. They help moat of the time, but the dissassocation, guilt and 'making friends' issues are still pretty epic.
I don't reccomend anyone go it alone - I just kinda didn't have a choice for the longest time - but man, I wish I could have gotten help sooner."
BPD,erkl8ur,t3_c2h3a8,1560965923.0,"More power to you! I was diagnosed around 10 years ago, ignored the crap out of it because it scared the living s*it outta me, and only very recently been coming to terms with ""yes okay, I have this, I need help.""
Looking at the past decade, I wish I had done it sooner. So GO YOU for doing it now, good luck!"
