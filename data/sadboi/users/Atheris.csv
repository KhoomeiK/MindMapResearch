I have a 5 gal that I want to rework. It's a reptile tank, so I need to strip the caulking and put in proper water sealant. I have purchased an undergravel filter and small heater. I do not yet have an aquarium light. Youtube has helped with figuring out cycling. My biggest thing is finding a proper species that can tolerant lower lighting and temperature. 

We have a small one-room apartment with only one window. It's an older design so lighting is tricky and the air conditioning is uneven, so some spots are really cold, and others muggy. On top of that, we now have two rescued cats. (Yeah, I know, not the best combo with fish)."

I've tried to ""will"" myself better when I was still in denial. To just learn from mistakes and not make them again. But it doesn't work that way the executive functions in the brain are short-circuited. Medication and behavior accommodations help, but, at least for me, the difference comes from the constant anxiety that is not if I make a mistake but when. How bad will the mistake be, and what consequences.

They can try pitocin if she's still feeling alright to help jump start labor again. If she's looking tired, they may suggest to go ahead and spay her. Kinda a two for one deal, since I doubt any others are alive. 

Is she still nursing baby #1? I'd take both her and the baby in together in a blanket inside a carrier/box/et ect. She will be less stressed if not separated, and given what you've said, odds are she will be there for a few hours to overnight. She can keep the kitty warm, clean and fed. The hospital can bottle feed if she's out for sx. 

And yes, I apologize for not acknowledging your gratitude. ;P People like you are why I do what I do. It's awesome to see someone that really cares about their babies and are willing to ask questions. I see too many clients that just don't seem to care, or go the opposite extreme and treat their pets like baby dolls. 

Oh! A big P.S. before I forget. You can look up an organization called Modest Needs. They help people in financial need by paying directly to their emergency. It's faster and helps weed out people that would be looking for cash. They are a non-profit and all funds are donations.

My computer sucks. Anyway, how are you doing? How is KitKat? Where I'm located veterinarians are considered essential services because we provide rabies vaccines. Emergency vet clinics should still be available. You could always call a local vet and ask what they recommend. As for cost, a lot of clinics will have an emergency fund to help clients in need, or do payment plans. You could ask about that on the phone too. 

If you are certain there is still a kitten, I would recommend going to the vet. They can give drugs to help contractions, or just do a cesarean. Most vets will go ahead and spay the cat during a cesarean and it shouldn't interrupt nursing. As long as the babies are warm and dry they will be ok for a couple of hours alone. A drop of corn syrup on their tongue will prevent low blood sugar. This is if they are separated a while. They go back with mom as soon as she's awake enough."

The second part is reminding myself that no matter where in life I am, I am making an active choice to be there. Like walking through sucking mud, or wet snow. I may not be going anywhere fast but I have to keep taking that next step. It's easy to fall into feelings of helplessness, or that things are beyond your control. I hate my job. I remind myself that I have the option of just not going. I verbally tell myself, ""I am going today because I will make X amount of money"" or some such. Just remembering that you have the choice to do something really drastic and don't helps.

The secret to the second part is to break everything down to its smallest pieces. When you think you have, keep going and do it again. For instance. Thoughts of, ""I hate my job; I'm not going anywhere; I'm a slave to a horrid malignant narcissist "". I first think, ""ok, so I need a different job"". That sounds terrifying and instantly impossible. So break it up. First, gotta have a resume. How do I do that? Find a template. Fill in the easy stuff first. Et ect. Some days just opening a word document is the small step I get through. Something easy that I can do quickly. Even if it takes days to do, and I'm an anxious mess afterward, sending one short email asking for a letter of rec, or a friends advice. Sometimes that's all the energy you have for that day. But it is something.

I like the app ""Habitica"". There are depression groups there that can help you form and maintain goals. People to talk to that get it. If you are able, sometimes avoiding neurotypical people helps. Nothing drives home feelings of disfunction more than listening to assinine babble about ""just do something fun"" or ""we've all been sad sometime"". Find someone that you can connect with. Also Betterhelp.com is online counseling. It's a lot easier to write emails back and forth, than deal with someone face to face.

A lot of this is hurry up and wait.  If this is a first litter it's likely to have fewer kittens. Take your cues from her. If she's relaxed, don't sweat it. We only worry if they are trying to push but nothing is coming out. That can mean bad position or big baby. 

Some bleeding after is expected but since cats keep pretty clean you probably won't notice. If there's discharge after several days or a week, or fresh blood I'd make an appointment.

I work for an organization that promotes cat colony caretakers. People often want to put out food and shelter for feral cats, but that only makes the problem worse if they aren't also going to be sterilizing them. Some caretakers get really attached to their cats. They know them by sight and can tell when someone is missing or injured or if there is a new cat that needs to be TNR'd.
