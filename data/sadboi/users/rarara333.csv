It’s tricky to explain, but imagine you are in public & you trip over. You’d probably feel pretty stupid, but that doesn’t mean that you are actually stupid. It just means that you tripped over because you were distracted for a moment.  What you feel is very real, but it’s not actually reality. I’ve worked with a counselor for some time, but can’t remember the proper term for this. 

Next time you’re feeling awkward, keep yourself busy by helping in the kitchen. The host will love you, it’s a quiet place to escape to, and if you offer to hand around a plate of canapés you can say hello to people, but have an excuse to move on quickly."
