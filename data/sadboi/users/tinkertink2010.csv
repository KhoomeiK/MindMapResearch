YouniquePresenterKM,fp46w9r,t3_gakn8z,1588292884.0,The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I don't know what her daughters long term plans are but it really saddens me that she hasn't gone onto further education as I think it would be so beneficial for her. I know education is not for everyone but she would be around people her own age and not being KM's maid and nanny.
YouniquePresenterKM,fp468re,t3_garojf,1588292513.0,Crusty! I feel claustrophobic with the amount of product she has on her face.

ketouk,fi3lir7,t3_f69g4w,1582122158.0,I'm in the same boat. I don't like tea or coffee with cream so I've been adding a splash of semi skimmed  milk. I measure out 100ml of milk into a little jug and know that is less than 5g carbs. That's more than enough for the amount I drink. I tried alpro almond milk but hated it. I've read that blue diamond brand is much nicer so I've got that coming tomorrow with the asda shop. I'm hoping it's OK so I can give up the milk and use the carbs for something else!
YouniquePresenterKM,fgu9wix,t1_fgshgyk,1581115759.0,The other day she did a game night (bingo) where people paid $25  (I think) a ticket to win younique products and other tat. Bare in mind these are probably what she buys with y cash (free) that she earns through sales. There were a lot of partakers. She is all about the $$$. As she has previously said she would do anything for money.....

YouniquePresenterKM,fekso7o,t1_feknins,1579206784.0,"I agree (mostly) I'm not saying she isn't attractive, has a lovely house and kids, it's all the lies. She is always preaching about accountability. The whole cancer girls scam, the beads will help all your ailments (from cancer to constipation), the skincare pics that show ""improvement"" which can be explained with lighting and filters, the blocking and name calling when asked to clarify things, the driving while filming herself, poor Frank her service dog and a million other things."

YouniquePresenterKM,feie4z7,t3_epbgji,1579136393.0,Oh KM we don't hate you because we are jealous. It because of you asking for money to young dying girls (who you said you face time) who didn't exist. And for shilling magic beads and dollar store quality makeup. Please get a conscience.

Lots of cheap nuts, pork scratchings and most have a fridge and freezer section with lots of deli meats, world meats and sausages, Halo Top ice creams super cheap, hartley's sugar free jelly. Also every town has pound shops which have things for even cheaper. Another cheap shop is called Herons. Similar prices to Home Bargains.  Have fun in the UK! X"

My favourite keto meals are fathead dough pizza, spag bol, a fry up, crackslaw (pork mince with cabbage, sesame oil and other spices) - Google it its so good! Chicken satay (using Jimmy's sate sauce) tastes like takeaways. Also have been having fried sauerkraut with bacon (hate it raw but so delicious fried in butter and bacon!)"

The NHS mental heath treatments have changed a lot over the years and you can now self refer yourself to access different services. Google IAPT Liverpool. They assess you to see what service would be best for you. Even if you go just to have someone to talk to. I think moving somewhere you don't know anybody is kind of self punishment. I hope life improves for you hun.
