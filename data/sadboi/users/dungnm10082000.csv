Another note is the thermals. My laptop is the refreshed version, with the supposed better thermals compared to the UN, and I haven’t experienced throttling, even when playing heavier titles like FH4, the i5 8250u and the mx 150 performed as expected, although the laptop did get a bit toastier than I’d like. Of course, when buying an ultrabook, performance isn’t your first priority, although things like thermals can affect the span of the laptop, as I had to had the motherboard changed once, and the SSD changed thrice, and if you’re under warranty (like I was), it could be quite a trip to the service center and back, (unlike Vietnam, where service centers are everywhere), although with the exception of Apple, I think this is true for all laptop manufacturers.

Take a look at the NextGen, any of them is now capable of beating the Big Three in a Bo3 tournament, but can we confidently say the same about Bo5s? No, especially at RG and Wimbly.

I agree, Wimbly is more prestigious, but that in parts is because it is one of, if not the first tournament of tennis in the history, it’s played in England, where people relate to being royal and all that good stuff. The fact that it favours attacking imo is just one of the things that make it great. It’s the settings, the sense of occasions, the royals, the outfits, everything.

I don’t want to believe that you don’t like the French that much is because Pete never won it (correct me if I’m wrong lol).

And what’s wrong with grinding it out on the baseline? It’s a sport, a competitive sport, endurance and resilience should be counted in, you can always luck out with a serve, but it’s harder when you have to grind it out.

And I’m sorry, I’ve seen old films, and serve and volleys isn’t my liking, it looks too simple, there’s little to no chance for a break, but every point is the same.

You said of skills, well I agree that grass favours those with great attacking skills, ie Roger, but clay favours one with better defending skills, how can you say a player is more complete when his defending skills in relatively poor compare to 2 others (again, Roger has better defending skills than most of the players in the history, but I’d say that he pales in comparison to the other 2)

You said Roger is the GOAT, well neither of them is done, they have more to give, especially Nole and Rafa, are you that certain Roger will have the most when it’s all said and done?

You said of depth, well I don’t mean to disrespect, but Roger haven’t be able to consistently out rally the other two, what happened? Are his techniques not right? Are his shots bad compared to the other two’s?

This is not me bashing Roger, no, I think that he is one of the three greatest players who have played the game, he is a freak of nature, ranked 3 in the world at age 38, 20GLs, the list goes on, but fedtards don’t get to trash on the other two greatest players of all time, they are freaks as well, one dude won 15 GLs in 10 years, the other won 12 RGs in 15 years, and the only thing that realistically stood in his way was injuries."

tennis,fc4jqk7,t3_efsqb3,1577418676.0,why compete for the best match of the decade when it is a strong candidate for the greatest match that have ever been played

tennis,fbeatft,t3_eb7w7i,1576782024.0,"Soderling has a strong case here, he’s beaten both Roger and Rafa at the FO, and remember, the only other player to have done the same thing (I think Nole probably beat Roger that the French somewhere during the last 15 years) is Novak, who is regarded as one of the three greatest players of all time, the player who have reached the highest level of tennis in history (not my words, Rafa’s). Granted, Rafa was injured back then, but it’s not like he was 100% in 2015.

It’s sad that many people forgot about him die to his short career."

Like, everyone has great shots compared to lower class players, but some just hits some shots better than others, like Rafa prolly hits better forehands than Benoit."
tennis,faya92f,t1_fanojtg,1576397392.0,Base on what can you say your mental game is strong?
tennis,fay9kqd,t1_faolk9z,1576397074.0,"Rafa’s book is pretty awesome, gives me at least, a glimpse inside of his monster mentality, is observations. I mean, I didn’t learn anything technically, but I learnt about trying to stay calm in any situations, and his views on the game and life in general. 

A good read if you’re interested in how a guy can overcome being born with a silver spoon in his mouth to become the biggest fighter in the sport"
tennis,fay602x,t3_ead15d,1576395415.0,"Well, you can basically say bye bye to serve and volley for good, which is something I think this sub would want to see, instead it’s points after points of players grinding it out, and let’s be honest, can get old real quick.

Each players have their own strength, if you reduce the 1st serve, you basically threw out thousands of hours practicing from players like John Isner or Riley Opelka, who relies on their serves a lot since their heights doesn’t allow them to grind it out with the likes of Diego Schwartzman."
