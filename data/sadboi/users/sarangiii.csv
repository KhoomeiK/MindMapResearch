12 (for a high E string on guitar)
16 (for a G string on guitar)
18 (for a G string on guitar)
20 (for a G string on guitar)

I think they typically come in packs, so I‚Äôd get a pack for the G string with the sizes above and if you can, a single 12g for the high string.

I won as a second-time applicant this year. I used the same affiliate, but they wrote a new letter. This time around I looked at former grantee essays and it was super SUPER helpful for reformatting and re-selling my original project idea into something that was more feasible and appealing to my commission. I used 2/3 of the same recommenders, but opted to change the 3rd to a former adviser (he was my PhD adviser for the 6 months of my PhD that I started before I left the program) who could speak to my ability to act as an informal US representative abroad, as the program was in the UK. 

Keep the dream alive. Don‚Äôt give up and try again. If you feel like you can or it‚Äôs necessary, try looking into a different country.

Mine does not sound like a violin when played by someone more familiar with playing styles that are more idiomatic to Nepali music. It does when I play it, but that's not due to its shape. It's more to do with my inexperience and novice with the instrument."

If you're planning to use Fulbright to do research you'll contribute to your thesis, I'd recommend waiting to do it towards the end, if whatever other funding you've got for your MA program allows for it. 

The first time I applied, it was because I didn't know what to do with myself. I knew what I wanted to research, but I didn't know what I wanted to do. They can and did see that from a mile away. Didn't even make it past the NSC. The second time I applied, I knew exactly what I wanted to research, why I wanted to research it, and how I was going to go about doing it (both applications were post-MA), and now I'm a finalist.

My point is, if you have a concrete research project in mind, know why it's important to you and why anyone else should care about it (which they obv should, but it's on you to sell it), go for it. If you're just looking for something to do and kinda have an idea but want to use the time to figure out what you really want to do, my advice would be to reconsider and wait until you do know what you want to do."
