YouTube will help for sure. Most sources always say ""no size fits all"" and that is true. But you can find lots of guidance, and most of them will encourage you to experiment. So if in doubt, find a different video and use their buzz words and topics to make more research in Google.

triathlon,fp7jpls,t1_fp7hz1u,1588371907.0,"Also, I'd add: there's no n00bs in triathlon. There are responsible and irresponsible athletes. There's soooo much to learn, so everybody should get time to prepare, read, learn. It's totally fine if you don't know something,you can always ask.

The following is something I'd call irresponsible that happened to a friend last year: she had been training tri for the whole 2019, we started together. I read, learned and practiced how to change a tire and took some time to explain some buddies including her, personally one person at a time. She didn't train and the day before of the competition, she got to the hotel around 6pm, I was getting my stuff ready as I was doing 1+100+10k next day and trying to sleep early.
Long story short: I ended fixing her flat (that had been flat for 2 weeks) because she wouldn't have been able to race. She had no tools, no spare, no patches, and no knowledge. Even though I had already explained her everything about that, months before. She was negligent in being prepared and that's wrong. 

I'm always eager to help a friend, but don't compromise me like that. Another lesson? Always carry lots of extra spare tubes. They're not expensive."
triathlon,fp7dncj,t3_gbi929,1588368662.0,"As everybody has said, go clipless. It's a good idea. But... 

If you're slipping out the pedal while riding, it's likely because you lack some more skill on the feel for your feet or overall bike handling. It's common to have to pedal a little it harder when the gear is changing, or to have a specific foot where you feel that your bike changes better.

With or without your clips, being comfortable on your bike is the most important issue to the sport. So I'd encourage you to get some more km, but focus on the feel. Don't try to go real fast. Get a slow street, find some hills, go up and down. You'll feel when it is time to have a fast gear or a hard gear, to preempt your gear when going into a hill.

Read a little bit on what cadence is, about your bike fit (saddle height, arms reach, frame size). All of those details, are things you *need* to learn before or after going clipless. And they will help getting your mind busy and satisfied before the expense of the shoes+pedals."

You can take a very saturated electrolytes mix and dilute it among the water bottle on each fill-up if that's possible. 2 liquid bottles tend to be very tight on hydration for that kind of ride.

Make sure you know how to change tires, patch one (even if you take 2 spares). Make sure your chain is well oiled.

You'd like to have a rear red flashing light, to be seen, even during the day.

Your bike should be very well maintained; you don't want to walk 50k if something goes slightly wrong. Be ready for everything. If you're not in a competition, then time is not an issue, then you can carry some weight for risk management. of course, you can divide weight carrying between 2 people, which is good"
costa_rica,fo0drnu,t1_fnhigk1,1587411178.0,"Lol why is this getting downvoted.

 You need to consider: CR is a smaller market than a mere city in the US can be. Competition is harder because of the lack of clients (in any business). What other said of the budget going small because of the crysis, that's right. I hope your research of ""nobody's hiring branding"" includes a broader time span than the last 2 months where covid-19 hit.

If you want to come to CR to do business, you'll need to speak Spanish. Otherwise, you'll close yourself a lot of the little business possibilities that there are here.

That's why Gmail is so rough with emails and their ""accept loading images"" message. Your spam folder won't ever load images. 

They can add a 1 pixel image that you'd load if you opened the email. When you load the email, it can have a unique code that will tell them ""yeah Jessica here opened the email because the image http://images.com?code=1234 was loaded"".

I can eli5 into how that works, but the practical issue is that one.
