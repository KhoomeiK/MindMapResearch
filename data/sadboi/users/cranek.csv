He won't actually be able to get anyone to come out with him because he comes across wrong/rubs people the wrong way in these first interactions. One way or another, he will find the answer, but I think going out and trying to make new friends is the first step into finding out what his actual issue is."

socialskills,f8vid2p,t3_e2hht3,1574870117.0,"Honestly it's make more friends; if a couple of people aren't willing to make time for you or reschedule, then it's time to find some that are willing to. No offence, but why waste time on non-quality people? Broaden your circle of friends and find people who are actually interested in doing things with you instead of trying to force people who aren't interested."
depression,f5xdxf6,t1_f5xb0um,1572539402.0,"What would be left would be actually who he is; a person who doesn't feel as if he amounts to anything because he doesn't see the value in what he's earned. When you take away what everyone thinks (gj you have a good job, you're ""doing well"" in life) and ask him why he's actually unhappy it could be two things: a chemical imbalance in the brain (definitely possible, although the likelihood of such a brain malfunction is probably not very high) or that he is doing things for others because he thinks that is good.

Why else would everyone praise him, but he himself sees no value in the things hes doing? His facade as he eloquently puts it makes him believe that that is what people like him for. 

'Genuinely don't know why people like me'. He's so good at pretending at being someone he believes people will like that he can't even identify if that's actually him anymore. All of this points to him doing things for others instead of himself; I get it because I was the same way. When you stop trying to please others and ask yourself what you really want, you realize you aren't a fake anymore, because you're doing things for yourself."

relationship_advice,evq4szp,t3_cksbzx,1564686383.0,"It's mostly a mindset thing; you view a relationship and sex as being something special and intimate most likely; people that hook up easily without having the aforementioned problems see sex as just something that's fun and that they can do to blow off some steam. When you realize that sex is just something normal that people do, like running or cycling, then it makes it easier for you to accept the sex as just for what it is and not for something more."

hsp,evlr1l5,t3_cjbosp,1564598110.0,"Congratulations! You've managed to step away from toxic people and you should feel really proud of yourself! That's the first step done! Now that you have your own time to yourself, you have to start thinking about what it is **you want to improve about yourself.** This is literally the next step; figure out what facet of your life do you want to improve on. Do you want a loving gf to have an amazing relationship? You can start learning about how to become the kind of person that attracts a loving gf. Do you want more money? You can start looking at ways of increasing your income. Being alone is alright; we're always alone and we die alone. But it's the way that we spend our time when we're alone is what turns a person into an exceptional human being."
hsp,evln71q,t3_cjdc49,1564596732.0,"I think that's a great way to learn about your friend! She basically let you know how much attention she feels is okay in your relationship and now you know you need to tone it back a bit because she's not okay with you being too attentive.

&#x200B;

It's a great thing that you really care about her (you said shes a close friend) so this is just one more piece of information to use when going forward with your friendship with her. Everyone has their own levels of comfort, personal information they choose to divulge and personal boundaries. We just need to make sure that when we know we've overstepped our boundaries to not do it again, and slowly see what they are actually comfortable with. Learning this just means that your friendship can become even better now that you know how to make her more comfortable with you!"
