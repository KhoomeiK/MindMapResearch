Except in my year he was going through an incredibly messy divorce.

Because people don‚Äôt only use it to describe entitled customers anymore, they use it to describe any women who does something loud or pushy or demanding or asks to speak with a manager over something  reasonable or talks to HR or does something they don‚Äôt like or speaks up. Listen entitled people suck, but ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù at this point isn‚Äôt just used for that purpose. Tons of people use Karen when someone speaks up. You might not, but the phrase itself is being used unjustly , and it would be better for everyone to refer to entitled customers as ‚ÄúECs‚Äù or entitled people."

Or are you talking about the phones getting old? If so, you should note apple comes out with new iPads often and old ones would need to be replaced anyways. Using phones would save the school money because students who‚Äôs parents make over a certain amount per year would provide there own phones to be used in class, thereby utilizing an already existent tool. If your suggesting offering iPads to the kids who cants afford phones, that would make them feel excluded and sorta highlights there inability to pay.
