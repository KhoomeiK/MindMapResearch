The point was good (except maybe the ''don't pass out in the metro'' message... which I still don't understand why they thought it might be useful to tell people passing out sucks), but the tone was SO condescending it gave me headaches.   


The one about not blocking doors went like ''we're all sometimes late, but acting like a great samurai with your umbrella to get in the train something something''. With the most condescending tone of voice. I never even saw anyone blocking doors on purpose to get in (except teenagers one or twice to let in their whole gang of friends). I've seen people do it accidentally because they hopped in and their backpack got stuck in the door."

WinterBlues,f9unoh7,t3_e6yvnr,1575654423.0,"Light therapy has a more long-term effect. It's recommended to use it at the same time every day, and it helps to ''set'' your brain to a regular daytime schedule. It helps reduce depressive symptoms in general after using it regularly for a bit. It might help you wake up in the morning and have some energy to get things done. It doesn't work for everyone. 

Inducing insomnia when you already have depressive symptoms is a really bad idea!"
