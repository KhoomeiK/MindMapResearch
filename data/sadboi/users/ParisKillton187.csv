metalgearsolid,fnd5g1p,t3_g0zxvs,1586859486.0,Its going to happen for sure considering the success of current remakes but the huge concern for me is is that the only person who is capable of making this work properly wants very little to do with it and we will probably end up with something fairly underwhelming due to it.
gaming,fnd4ckj,t3_g12pex,1586858257.0,Low hanging fruit and stupid post. Bioware used to be one of the most prolific and important developers in the world and what EA did to them is very sad and is a cautionary tale about capitalism's compulsion to destroy art if they see enough people enjoy it.
residentevil,fnd3e0b,t3_g0zeif,1586857165.0,"I know you guys are going to hate me for saying this but I don't want this. While it is a game that is on the level of RE2 and FF7, I just think it's too soon and we need to hold off here."

I like shitty things sometimes too. Sometimes I eat hot dogs and I didn't mind The Last Jedi.... Just enjoy what you can while you can enjoy anything at all.
bloodborne,fn5a1u7,t1_fn59vh7,1586659576.0,Absolutely. It seems like peanuts in comparison... not to say that the end game is easy by any means but after those fights you will probably feel like a god in comparison to what is left.

He was clearly mentally ill though and as a result we can assume very lonely and the manager was engaging with him in every little bit of conversation that this dude could muster up in a non patronizing fashion. He cared about what this guy was saying. He wasnt rubbing him off like a booger on the back of someones couch like some people may have done in that situation. He treated him like a human being and found things to relate to him with. It was beautiful. He still works there and man... I just gotta say. Their employees were what made that store. Good people.

PS4,fmzcohr,t1_fmzc2td,1586515480.0,If you think that more information than that of what is presented in this review is required for you to buy a copy of Final Fantasy 7 remake. You should not be playing it in the first place. You should be watching tutorials about how to make Youtube videos so that you can vent your frustrations caused by your incapacity to enjoy anything good in the world.
PS4,fmyfwpv,t1_fmy2ucg,1586485212.0,That totally makes a lot of sense though and to be honest I want a physical copy and this is one of those games I can wait for.

PS4,fmxuoto,t1_fmxtizd,1586472226.0,Well I obviously want to play it. The game looks really good but if my theory if correct this has to do with manufacturing physical copies which could potentially mean we will see Cyber Punk 2077 before we see The Last of Us Part 2.

What I mean is there is actually some things you cannot simply do with a controller that you could do with a mouse and keyboard and Doom Eternal has sort of left it just as hard as it would be with a mouse and keyboard for someone playing with a controller which I do not fault them for at all it is just simply a fact that it is harder to play it with a controller than a PC set up.... if not seemingly impossible sometimes."

The problem is is that people today seem to be more passionate about youtubers who talk about videogames than videogames themselves. Unfortunately in order for youtubers to get more views and therefore more revenue they tend to be negative about what ever they possibly can be because negativity sells, it creates views and views give them ad revenue. What would be a more interesting video to click on? ""New Resident Evil Remake is good as good as I expected it would be."" or ""WTF NEW REmake is Garbage! Should Have been DLC!"" This negativity creates a hivemind that is not just annoying but very concerning as a videogame fan because people who don't actually play games and are just addicted to youtube clout and likes on their videos are going to begin dictating what games certain corporations decide to greenlight and we are just going to end up with nothing but garbage in the future."
