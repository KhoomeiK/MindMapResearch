 professional issues: a lot of my therapist didn‚Äôt really see it as abusive and just as ‚Äúthat trash boy‚Äù and to stop ‚Äúworrying about him‚Äù when it was very obvious i was being emotionally abused. 
resources: this reddit. podcasts (kissed with abuse) helps me feel less alone, and that my abuse is valid even though it wasn‚Äôt physical. finding the right therapist worked wonders. and just the right support system helps too. cutting off people who were my best friend for saying it was my fault i was abused helped tremendously. it‚Äôs nice to get rid of the negativity."
