I remember in 2008 when we had the economic bubble burst and how many people took their own lives because of unemployment...what will become of us after this crisis?
SuicideWatch,flb8vig,t3_fnly3z,1584999747.0,I think I am a likely candidate for this virus...had pneumonia twice before and am 34...if I catch this it would kill my weakened lungs for sure....pneumonia weakens your lungs after you recover from it and coronavirus pretty much destroy your lungs so...though it would be an bad way to die...
AlchemistCodeGL,f7opiyu,t3_dwk5ko,1573931483.0,Thanks phato...i am gonna try it now....I hope they fixed the problem that abhiu had on Episode 1 3-5 too.
AlchemistCodeGL,f7kuziw,t3_dwg6oz,1573826636.0,"This is the one I am stuck at!! Made a thread about it too...Caesar and sabareta are in God mode and just keep attacking us like crazy...it seems it's happening to other stages as well this endless guts bug...I will send a bug report too...tried yesterday but got an endless ""connection failed"" and had to quit..."
AlchemistCodeGL,f7kunyn,t3_dwlz9i,1573826373.0,I saw you post in my thread and it seems this bug is happening in other stage too...we should report it since it may happen in future story stages...just like in 2-9 where Caesar and the thief boss who has endless guts too and are immortal due to it....
AlchemistCodeGL,f7kucai,t3_dwk5ko,1573826108.0,I guess it's best if we all send support tickets....this is a damn roadblock and it may happen in other stages and will drive away new guys like us from the game...
AlchemistCodeGL,f7k32u2,t3_dwk5ko,1573793315.0,Yes I even looked all over for a guide thinking this battle had some special condition(didn't find anything by the way) but as its happening too with you guys it looks a major bug...it seems I will have to try to contact support or wait for an update to fix this endless guts skill
valkyrieanatomia,ezy6mol,t1_ezy63ij,1568259339.0,True...I play lots of gachas and this one got to be the worst of all for rates...they don't give enough gems in daily login plus the rates are awful...i remember when I blew 25 k to get lezard and got two artifacts for the other char that was with him... I am not even considering getting Guts when he arrives anymore...star ocean anamnesis had crappy pull rates but at least they gave lots of daily gems
valkyrieanatomia,eza6y3v,t1_eyqhdo6,1567795923.0,What the...I was present in the Valkyrie Alice banner and didn't get a step 1 ticket at all .. I went to the step 1 ticket exchange booth and there is nothing there!!!
soanamnesis,ew5jgqc,t1_ew3b58c,1565137749.0,I am trying another Eden...just to kill time till tales of crestoria and FF war of visions...I am going to be extra careful with namco games after the whole tale of rays fiasco...war of visions will probably have an long time since it's still FF
soanamnesis,ew5ivxh,t1_ew3b06k,1565137355.0,"This is the first gacha that I played that closed so I didn't know...but it still is a an asshole move since you see so many people still clinging to hope about an big update being prepared and their utter silence about it...to me it reminds me of the classic era of RPGs(snes,ps1 and PS2 era) where the great jrpg titles were released in Japan and the Western audience would get nothing...star ocean and tales of rays are still open there and all our time, money and enjoyment spent on this is gone...I have waited a long time to get lezard...spent  45k to get him and failed...had to reroll three times and got him...was really happy playing as him since it's that I wanted way back from VK 1... and suddenly can't enjoy the second season of the story as him...to hell with square enix"
soanamnesis,ew5hfsr,t1_ew4f5l9,1565136355.0,I really hope they do that...but I already uninstalled the game and trying Another Eden for the first time...I have never seen an gacha game that once closed be reopened just.like that....if this miracle happens I would come back...but the way I see it seems to me that for square if it's not final fantasy and it doesn't reach one million download or more they close it down...I already fear for the future of valkyrie anatomia and hope that by the time they close it down tales of crestoria or FF war of visions is released....tales of rays never came back despite lots of people were upset about it closing down
soanamnesis,ew3as77,t3_cmmjw2,1565070319.0,Yeah looks like people were right about all the signs of closing down...those fucking bastards could have done it sooner instead of creating ´´suspense´´ with a whole month of nothing...I fear for the future of valkyrie anatomia.....it seems square will ONLY keep around the final fantasy games and the rest they will shut down...
soanamnesis,evzu2yd,t1_evzklo9,1564967304.0,If this falls then Valkyrie anatomia will most likely fall too in a couple of years...it seems square only fully support their final fantasy games... I downloaded Valkyrie anatomia on day 1 and am a fan of the series but it they don't reach 1 million downloads then they are more likely to shut it down
soanamnesis,evydy3x,t3_clw1xz,1564930167.0,I can only see summer Maria but not summer Millie...I am using Android too latest version
soanamnesis,evx96wf,t3_clpxre,1564885458.0,"I have seen summer maria in the character guide too...I am not interested in pulling them but are those two the only ones for ""summer"" units?"
soanamnesis,evx0ckj,t1_evvayw2,1564878316.0,I will definitely quit...I want to know the story and not just play for the sake of playing...I was kinda hopefull that they were just delaying but after all this time and only these reruns I kinda lost hope about the game...its a damn shame since I went to a lot of trouble to get lezard(failed his banner with 45k gems and had to reroll thrice to get him) and now this...It instills fear about valkyrie anatomia future too...it seems that any game of theirs that dont reach 1 million downloads then square will shut it down....I have been wanting to play as Lezard since the VK days and in this game I thought he was great and its really bothering me about losing everything....this is the first time I am saddened about an gacha game closing
soanamnesis,evtas5c,t1_evt8oxn,1564766436.0,😓
soanamnesis,evtama9,t1_evt5z79,1564766336.0,"Well at least we will have tales of crestoria to make up for it lol...and I don't think square/tri ace will make another star ocean mobile game so we either stay in this one or it's gone...in the other post the guy that sent a ticket and got like ""we can't tell you anything... Keep checking the website"" ...why give this ""suspense"" type of answer if they would plan to shut it down? Well nothing else to do but wait I guess..."
soanamnesis,evt9lbe,t1_evt3uzo,1564765716.0,I will play mostly for the story and who knows If I can get stronger to do the whole event of the other FF characters events( I only did like half of lighting's event)...plus I got to play with my favorite FF job(black mage)...in this game's case I just find it really strange...I mean if they wanted to shut it down wouldn't be easier to just do it instead of waiting like almost a month? I don't think it would take all this time just to write a sob story letter about the game shutdown....
soanamnesis,evt3ons,t1_evrvksl,1564762150.0,But at the same time why would it take them that long to shut down the game if they really planned to do it? It's been almost a month now and the even the infamous tales of rays/link case didn't take that long
soanamnesis,evt3f4w,t1_evszuxx,1564761988.0,I stopped playing Mobius last year because I thought they would shut it down after the end of the first story arc...then a while ago I have learned they added plenty of content and continued the story too ..even now there is the new FF 8 content and squall job card...I am Installing it again to get the 3rd anniversary goods...same thing could happen here... suddenly tons of content coming out way
soanamnesis,evt2ue2,t3_ckvnov,1564761637.0,I hate being dramatic but this is really strange...I mean I have never seen a gacha game being empty like this...but at the same time I don't think they would take this long to say something if they planned to shut it down....it's been like what ..almost a month now? It seems to me they run into some crazy technical issues with global update..or 2.0 story taking too long to translate...
valkyrieanatomia,eojovvl,t1_eo9ewv1,1558640823.0,Inst there a way to reroll in this game?? I did this on star ocean to get lezard there and it worked(on the same day he was released)... I dunno if this gacha is viable for reroll though
valkyrieanatomia,eohryyp,t3_brnceg,1558590528.0,I was kind skeptical about the collabs...about the licensing and stuff...but getting the first collab so soon with Full metal alchemist made me more optimistic regarding them and I think Berserk has a good chance to show up....thought to be honest I am only aiming for the Berserk Collab...I am saving all my gems/tickets for Guts and I do hope I dont have to go through all my recent trouble with Star Ocean...burned all my gems and tickets for Lezard there and got nothing...had to reroll 7 times till he showed up...I do hope I dont have to reroll here too :S
soanamnesis,eohrlq2,t1_eogc2rl,1558590173.0,Yeah that was my fear...I play other gachas and unlike Nier some limited units simply dont return...in brave exvius for instance its been a long time people asking for the secret of mana collab to return and nothing on global so far....my suspicion paid off with your info now...I am glad I rerolled for him otherwise he would be an goner for sure....if he were an regular ace I would wait but collab units usually dont return(unless they are from nier)....thanks for the congrats mornstar and galvatron261 try to reroll for your desired units....you may get some of them...I only wanted Lezard so it was simpler for me.
soanamnesis,eofu22p,t1_eoeu8v3,1558543486.0,"Yeah...and I thought it would take forever...I didn't even consider trying before the 1x draw pull since I thought that if I can't get him on a multi pull imagine on a 1x...but then I thought about the ""rare ticket"" try on brave exvius...the lowest chance to get your banner summon on exvius...and compared it with 1x draw in star ocean...turns out it worked...it seems from now on I should try the lowest chance pulls  on my gachas...it was like this with fei on brave exvius and now with lezard...I am saving like crazy on Valkyrie anatomia for Guts when shows someday...gonna begin with the tickets lol"
soanamnesis,eodwmnk,t1_eodmgm6,1558482738.0,"Yeah I only play that because of the step up....I didnt get Fei in the whole step up but on the 4 char ticket(ironic inst it)...but dark mage golbez I got him on my second step up...I pretty much got all the chars I wanted there...eventually will only do an mass pull when they rework Cyan one day(most FF 6 units are getting reworks)...otherwise my party there is pretty much set up...Fei and golbez were my main target anyway....and I managed to pull Lezard here on my reroll, I made a post down here...got him on my 7th reroll on 1x Draw(the hyper irony of all lol)...anyway thanks for all the info and moral support you and Luna gave me...I didnt bet my chances on reroll but there you have it"
soanamnesis,eodwatq,t1_eodkxog,1558482519.0,YES I finally managed to pull him Luna!!! and it was on my 7th reroll...I thought I would be stuck uninstal/install for days till I get him...and I got him in the most unlikely way...multi summon awarded only two 5 star(roddick and viktor)...free day pull only a 3 star....4-5 ticket only an 4 star I dont know...then only had like 1500 gems and thought ´´Screw it´´and used the 1x Draw on Lezard banner.....in the past I managed to grab 5 star Ace with 1x but it was REALLY rare...on my second 1X draw pull he showed up...thanks for all the moral support....anyone reading here and is after Lezard or Mystina and are out of gems/tickets give the reroll a try even if it is annoying...I didnt bet my chances on it but it really worked...
soanamnesis,eodvq5f,t1_eodp9ln,1558482131.0,Yeah thanks for all the info....I managed to get Lezard on my 7th re-roll today...and it was in the most unlikely way...managed the multi summon and got nothing...the ticket gave nothing....even tried the daily summon...still nothing...I thought ´´to hell with it´´and used the left over gems on 1x summon pull on Lezard banner....managed to get him that lol...I thought I would spend days uninstalling/installing but it paid off in the end...I had some ace 5 on my old account but the one I was really after was Lezard so now I will have to keep pulling and get others
soanamnesis,eodn7wt,t1_eodkxog,1558476583.0,Well I am gonna try my 6th now...its frustrating the whole ´´uninstall and install 2gb all over´´but like I said he is mostly the reason I am here....so no choice unless reroll everyday I guess...I am a F2P player on gachas and only use units I like...dont much care about the ´´powerfull unit´´of the month and only use chars I enjoy...so that why I am so adamant on getting him...I mostly play as Wizard/Mage type characters and Lezard is an wizard type I really like.
soanamnesis,eodm71g,t1_enyvnog,1558475946.0,OMGIAMAWESOME I am having really bad luck in the VP banner...I mean the ONLY char I want from the VP series is Lezard...the rest are a bonus....I am trying the reroll method some users recommended me too to get him...tried 5 times so far and nothing(before I hoarded 45k gems and lots of tickets and No lezard).....how many rerolls did you do to get the nier chars??? and do I have a chance to draw Lezard with the 5 ace ticket you get too??
soanamnesis,eodkbo4,t1_eocvuho,1558474994.0,Mornstar01 have you had any luck getting your desired unit only by reroll? So far it's being really unlucky for me..
soanamnesis,eodk049,t1_eoddyc9,1558474861.0,So this 6% for this game are simply not reaching me....on brave exvius I got fei from xenogears using only two 4 star character ticket...got another one on an 10k pull...was waiting for dark mage golbez got three of him spending 15k...not to mention got basch/wilhem and ayaka without spending a dime...just the same in opera omnia...got cloud ex weapon on a draw ticket...ramza ex weapon spending 20k....here you only get the gems and the tickets are worthless for the banner chars...a while ago tried for the 5th time rerolling for lezard and got nothing again...having to spend 90k for only an char is crazy...anyone here got the desired unit using only reroll?
soanamnesis,eodik0x,t1_eocfv2a,1558474292.0,Me too...I hoarded only for lezard...spent 45k gems and nothing...tried rerolling 5 times already and nothing too...if this 13 days pass and not get him then I quit too...limited collab banners takes forever to come back ....
soanamnesis,eod5kxg,t1_eociuc7,1558468771.0,I tried rerolling...4 times now and 0 lezards...got other 5 star chars but only one chance per reroll so have to redo all over...thanks for the info about the reroll...at least it's a chance to get him but it's really a pain to redownload all the time( I use Android non rooted)...the other gachas I play(all the Final fantasy ones minus Mobius) I got  what I wanted by hoarding...for instance in brave exvius I got an limited banner char I have been wanting for a long time last week...
soanamnesis,eochi77,t1_eocgfs3,1558458332.0,How can I reroll?and what is reroll? I mean I do like star ocean but I have only played the first game...VP I played all the games and always wanted to play as lezard (permanently)...This amount of frustration I am feeling is because It never happened to me before...all my other gachas I usually get my char or artifact with only 40k gems.. sometimes less...in this one I spent all my tickets and gems and got nothing
soanamnesis,eoc8ld8,t3_bqr74r,1558454605.0,I can't believe this....spent 45k on gems and didn't get lezard...spent all 5 star tickets and nothing...on all other gachas I play this never happened... everytime I hoarded for a char I got it...this game must have shitty rates for banner pulls...now 13 days left and only have 3k gems...I am seriously thinking about uninstalling since lezard was the only char I ever wanted(wanted to play with him since VP 1)...I dunno I can obtain 2k gems for an multi draw on 13 days with the login bonus...
