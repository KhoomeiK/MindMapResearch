I didn’t really think about the drops, that’s a good question. Maybe animal related items like wool, leather, bones, or honey. maybe saplings from the biome the player encounters it in.

aspergers,fqv46uj,t3_gkyleo,1589669527.0,"I have the same problem with cooking. It’s embarrassing and I feel really guilty about it all the time.

I really don’t understand why I can’t bring myself to do it. Depression is a factor for sure, because the most time I ever spend in the kitchen is when I’m manic or hypomanic.

It just feels completely overwhelming. It’s a combination of bad sensations, high risk objects like knives and fire, the planning, then time it takes to do the process, then clean up. Just interacting with the amount of objects it takes to cook one meal is something I really don’t want to do. I don’t want to touch 10 objects and avoid cutting and burning myself, avoid touching slimy and sticky things, the water for washing dishes is either too cold or too hot with basically no middle ground. Standing and waiting for real food to cook feels like an eternity, but I don’t want to split my attention with some kind of entertainment because of fire risk or just ruining the food. 

Everything about cooking feels horrible. Physically and mentally horrible.

Edit* and I completely forgot all the fucking noise. Clanking dishes and sinks and ovens and dishwashers and trying not to drop and break things."

This is problematic for me because I spiral out on certain lyrics and experience emotional issues.

For me, the semantic content of the music is problematic, so for the past few months I have been experimenting with only listening to French music (I don’t speak French.) now I constantly have those songs stuck in my head but the lyrics don’t mean anything to me so I don’t spiral out, instead I just vibe on the way it sounds. It’s no cure but  it has helped me better manage my head noise and I’ve actually been thinking about making a post on this to recommend it to others."

I play with my daughter at home and using a boat, elytra, or even running in a straight line for too long is impossible because the world in front of me is just sky and then an X-ray view. In the boat and with elytra I often crash into terrain I can’t see because it looks like just sky with the x-ray of caves underneath.

I’m just playing at home, docked, offline and the chunks load too slow to use the boat or run too fast.

Any suggestions would be really appreciated by my family.

For reference: I downloaded the game from the online store, I have no mods or textures or anything like that, it happens playing solo or split screen, less than 10 worlds saved and most are basically empty."
