Im not saying I wasn’t aware, I am more saying that I am dumb, in denial and impulsive. But this response was definitely a wake up call to my dumbness. 

I was taking prozac before, though at a lesser dose. 20 mg instead of 40mg. I was having these same manic symptoms but I was not doing any other type of drugs. Then they took me of prozac and now im back on it. Only this time with weed and acid in the mix.

I’ve been realizing that we have been given this life, and it’s our choice to live it how we want. 

I’m trying to go in the mindset of not getting addicted and I realize I  I want to live life how I want to. I have to at least try. If we are capable of experiencing something, why stop ourselves from experience it. That being said, as long as it isn’t hurting anyone intentionally, and I am living how I want to, I think that’s a life worth living. 
I definitely don’t want to run into extreme financial struggles. My economic situation is relatively simple. I’m not a materialistic person. As long as I have food and a roof over my head, can afford books and the occasional travel/experience I’m good. 
It’s awesome to hear that you are able to live despite your usage. I am for certain being responsible can be difficult, of course I am not aware of to what extent.
