I used to have Sleep Paralysis a lot when i was younger and still living in our old house. Like OP, i learned to recognize it so i just wait it out. I thought that it happens because i'm tired and slept on my back. I would just see weird shadows moving or hear inaudible voices when it happens, nothing too scary. But there's one that i can't ever forget. That time, we were 3 in the room. My sister and i sleeping on the bed and my cousin on the floor. We had the lamp on, as we always do. (This will be impt for later). Initially, i just can't move, i knew i was having an episode so i tried to wait it out. Then in the corner of my eye, i saw a tall black shadow standing beside the bed, facing me. It's standing so close i couldn't see it's face. Okay...still tried to stay calm but i think the shadow knew i saw it. Then my room became so dark and something pulled me upright and is shaking me like a doll. I can't see who is doing it to me. I couldn't breath and It' squeezing the life off me, shaking me then would slam me into the bed. I started to panic. I never had this before. I can see my sister sleeping beside me so i called for her but no matter how hard i scream, no voice is coming out. The shadow would shake me and strangle me then slam me back into the bed again. I still can't move my body and I was getting desperate to get out of this nightmare so i tried to recite a prayer like i see in movies. I started with ""Hail mary"". As i was chanting i could hear the shadow laughing at my attempt. Then it started mocking me by chanting the prayer with me. I tried changing prayers to Our father then to The Creed. It stopped mocking me at The Creed, it didn't strangle me again. Then i woke up. I couldn't sleep back again but i was so scared that i took the rosary from the altar. Now, i am not a very religious person, i am more agnostic. I just grew up in a catholic family and went to catholic school my entire life. The following morning i told my sister, cousin and aunt about it. Coincidentally, my cousin also had a nightmare that night. I never had that kind of sleep paralysis again and since we moved, i don't experience it as often as i used to."

Not that my mom isn't mean anymore, but i think i developed the shield to protect me from all of her arrows. It took me a long time to develop my own defense but now i can stay at home for more than a week. And in time, if you work hard, you'll get your own place too :) And for the skin issue, i hope you get comfortable with your own color one day, really. Mean jokes used to affect me so much (esp coming from my family) to the point that i starve myself when they say i'm fat or binge eat when they say i look sick for being too thin. Then I got sick. That's when i realized to stop the BS i'm doing. It's your body, it's your skin, no one gets to tell you what to do with it but you. I think self -esteem plays a factor in there. Surrounding yourself with positive friends actually helps (the ones who will hype you up). This comment got so long. Sorry lol. I just can relate so i feel like maybe you can take comfort from my story."

COVID19,fkeb855,t1_fkeabyg,1584109475.0,"I mean, does the ACE2 gets used up once the virus attaches and diffuses into the cell membrane?"
unpopularopinion,fkdkvii,t3_fhnd8e,1584082838.0,"I think we should just be more considerate and sensitive. Like if you know you're sick or was exposed, don't go out and quarantine yourself so as to not spread the virus. Don't hoard those alcohols, leave some for the others, don't sell overpriced masks for god's sake, just those little things can actually help."

rant,fkdbe75,t1_fkdaa4g,1584073329.0,Let's just do what we can. Educate ourselves and stay safe. And stay away from people haha. JK. (FR tho social distancing to avoid spreading the COVID)
COVID19,fkdb8l6,t3_fhpoiz,1584073202.0,"Can someone explain to me properly how ACE2 , an enzyme, is used by the Virus? I only read a few papers about it but i came up with more questions than answers. From what i understand, ACE2 is used as the ""key"" to go inside , from that point, what happens to the ACE2? Is it used up ? 

Also....just for clarification if i understood it: one of the reasons why people with comorbids like HPN are more susceptible and has the worst outcomes is bec some of the meds they use increases ACE2?

Please enlighten me. Thank you"
rant,fkda7v2,t3_fhnaxm,1584072395.0,"Same. 2020 started with the worst bang. My head is aching because of all these. I want to understand  all of this, the COVID ( i'm  in healthcare), the government's plans, etc. Because i want to be as rational as i could and help people...but damn. The people is more stressful than the actual virus itself"
