APUSH,fqro4mk,t1_fqrnm4e,1589588327.0,Yeah I think there were 4-5 prompts but everyone had different docs for the most part
APUSH,fqrkr6y,t3_gkjwjv,1589586339.0,"I go to a specialized high school for American history, so the apush curriculum is split up into 3 years and we take the apush test at the end of junior year. we learn the information in so much more detail than we need to, so the class is hard, but not impossible. my teacher this year for apush taught lecture style so he just stood in the front of the room and talked, but he is a really effective teacher. my notes are pages long, and its really drilled into my mind. we usually have like a week with little to no hw and then the next week is a lot of hw. he gave 2 tests and 2 essays per semester. the tests were hard and i did really bad on the first one but after that i did really well. while they were hard and annoying, i always got high 90s on the essays. i learned a lot from his class and he was a really great teacher. i can say the same about my other 2 us history teachers from freshman and sophomore year."
APUSH,fqrk04z,t3_gkk3yy,1589585896.0,it said mid july on the confirmation page
APUSH,fqrjwey,t3_gkk4km,1589585836.0,"im not a teacher or anything, but i think that they don't usually take off points for things like that. they usually just ignore something if it is wrong. as long as it wasnt something required on the rubric/ you had other information about it im pretty sure its fine."

Anxiety,fpiny0z,t3_g8v0l8,1588644885.0,"I completely agree!! I am the happiest I‚Äôve been in years right now because I get to spend time with my family, work on my hobbies and complete my schoolwork quickly without the distractions of classmates. I get so much more sleep and I am so much more productive. My zoom classes and a few phone/FaceTime calls with my friends a week is completely sufficient for me and I don‚Äôt even really miss them which is a little concerning to me. I really don‚Äôt want to go back to normal. Why can‚Äôt life always be like this!?"
Sat,flpm6cv,t1_flplqrs,1585362860.0,I used the college board sat book for practice tests and passages and it has some tips for English. Practice was the most helpful thing for me in terms of improving my English score.

Sat,flp7fj7,t1_flp5mou,1585353218.0,"Thank you! You got this, keep working towards your goal! I wrote out my studying tips as a reply to one of the other comments ! üòä"
Sat,flp5sn8,t1_flp2bsx,1585352251.0,"Yes! 

Here is the short version:

My main tips....
- tutoring (revolution prep)
- Khan Academy 
- cracksat.com for practice questions 
- I used the practice tests from my tutoring company, and the ones from the gigantic college board book (I think some of them can be found on khan academy)
- analyze your mistakes so you understand them! (Especially for math!)
- practice tests often
- change your mindset 
- just suck it up for a few months and devote all your free time to studying. You will have so much more time to hang out with your friends when the sat is over if you just work really hard and don‚Äôt have to take it again!

And here is the long version..... (sorry it‚Äôs so long I love to talk haha)

I started studied over the summer with my tutor. I took practice tests once a week over the summer but once school started I did them a  little less frequently. after I took each test I spent a lot of time going over it, making sure I understood my mistakes, and if I didn‚Äôt I watched khan academy videos or worked on it with my teacher. I also improved a ton on math by becoming more confident with it through a lot of practice! I also reach out to my math teacher for help often on topics I don‚Äôt understand especially if they appear on the sat. Reading tends to been hard for me because I have ADHD, but I just also practiced a lot and did practice reading passages whenever I could. The main issue I have with reading is timing, so I did single reading passages and gave myself a time limit that I had to try to complete exchange passage in. Then I took the test in December. I felt really prepared, but I got there, it was hard, and I was nervous. I knew I didn‚Äôt do well the minute I left the test. I did some khan academy practice on my own while I waited for my score. When I got my score, I knew I had to change some things. First thing I changed was my tutor. While she was helpful in teaching me reading strategies, she wasn‚Äôt as strong in math so she mostly had me practice reading, which I kind of reached my potential in on my practice tests. I found a new tutor and we did math for 1-2 hours a week and I was also learning a lot of the math in school so it was starting to make more sense to me. I kept practicing timing for reading on my own and a little with the tutor but I really honed in on math. From December to March I took as many practice tests as a could. If I fixing have time to take them all at once, I would do them section by section in a few sittings. That‚Äôs basically what I did to study, but a lot of my improvement came from my change in mindset. After the December sat, I knew I let the test defeat me. I didn‚Äôt want that to happen again so I worked on increasing my confidence. I began telling myself I was good at math and this was only a test and I just had to sit there for a few hours and then I would be done. I didn‚Äôt want to take it a third time, and go through all the agony of studying all over again, so I basically changed my mindset to: ‚Äúsit there for a few hours, take the test, you know how to do this, you‚Äôve done it before, just do it well once and you will never have to do it again‚Äù. And yeah, it seemed to work lol. It feels great to not have to study anymore!! It took up sooooo much of my free time. 

Sorry this was so long!"
