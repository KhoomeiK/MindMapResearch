Esthetics,fpklxex,t3_gdqlcz,1588697021.0,"Letâ€™s use some basic math. Thereâ€™s legally 2,080 work hours in a payable year for salaried employees. That averages out to a little over $33.00 an hour. I worked within a medical esthetic setting at a plastic surgeonâ€™s office and the most I ever made was $20 an hour.

I also independently booth rented at a spa. I offered micro-needling, Dermaplaning, microdermabrasion, all the expensive facial ad-ons that are vital to a successful self owned business. I also offered Mink eyelash extensions were VERY lucrative.

That all being said, your start up cost being a self-employed esthetician will be hefty. You have to buy your own product, your own furniture, your own machines."

Itâ€™s scientifically not addictive but anything you use to alter you reality in an abundant amount will fuck you up. Be it psychologically or mentally. Be proud of your sober moments and seek them more often. Donâ€™t be jealous of your high friends. Read about the Hedonic Set-point-it will help you understand things.
