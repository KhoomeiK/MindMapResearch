I couldn’t, we have similar stories in that I was also in a poor family growing up, and once I started working at 16, it started with my mom asking for $20 for gas which was fine because that wasn’t a huge part of my check, and eventually the amount of money started increasing and it got worse when I tried opening a bank account and have it tied to my moms since I wasn’t 18, and off of that she had direct access to my checking me account. It eventually got to the point where she would stop asking to take money and she would just take and leave me to find out later. Mind you since I was still in school working a part time job, I was only getting around $300, and she was taking upwards of $200, and she didn’t support me much either so I had to take myself to school and work without a car. Her excuse for taking my money was that I lived in her house and that I should willingly give up my paycheck to her to continue living there. What irritated me the most out of all of it was that she would willingly go and drop $400+ on make up, then complain that she doesn’t have money and take mine. I no longer live or talk my mother and haven’t for a little over a year and have no intentions of doing so, it ain’t so bad after a while. I also know these are rookie numbers compared to your 15k, but it’s just to relate and share my piece."

I should’ve told her she needs to give me those fries back but you know, I’m the customer service, there’s that insanely stupid, “the customer is always right” rule so I had to let it go."
