mentalhealth,fr6amqt,t3_gmupxd,1589922847.0,"A few things. Firstly, yes it's super unethical and your relative could lose licensure for it depending on the state.

Secondly, I work in child welfare and you could lose your foster home status and face potential consequences for doing that. Courts can order it for the child, but nobody can force them to participate and any therapist/psychiatrist worth their salt won't diagnose or evaluate someone without consent. 

Lastly, recognize that even if someone can evaluate them, without official documentation, which your relative can't legally give without consent of the child or legal guardian (child welfare services), the diagnosis or evaluation will have no meaning or bearing on anything. It can't be admitted into the case documentation. It can't be the basis for any future therapy or medication. It can't get any accommodations through the ADA. Etc. 

I know you're trying to help, but this would destroy the relationship between you and the child, would almost certainly end up with the child being removed from your care, and would make them very unlikely to ever trust anyone involved in their case or care in future. They would also most likely not seek any future treatment and have a lasting distrust in mental health professionals."
AmItheAsshole,fr4263u,t3_gm3duc,1589873274.0,"YTA and that's also straight up illegal. I work in child welfare and as foster parents you can't deny religious observance to a child. You can say you won't drive them etc. Basically telling them they can figure it out on their own, but it's 100% illegal, in the US at least, to tell them they can't attend their preferred services.

If you adopted you could do that but you'd still be the a-hole because adopting a child (nearly adult) knowing they value their religion and then telling them they can't practice is terrible.

Lastly YTA because you're saying the Catholic church has a bad history with kids ignoring that Unitarian churches have also had their share of allegations. Unitarians are also doctrinally very different and if you really cared for this kid and valued their freedom to choose to practice religion you would help them find a Catholic parish with a priest you trust. Unlike Unitarians etc. the Catholic doctrine is fairly standardized across all the parishes. You could find a good parish with a priest you trust and still allow her to practice. Instead you've decided that even after the Catholic church went through and cleaned house hard you can't trust them. 

Honestly, YTA all around and if the courts got wind of you denying religious observance they could have you stripped of your Foster home status..."
AmItheAsshole,fr3l8pa,t3_gmbije,1589859874.0,"YTA sorry man, but children/families are a conversation you should have before marriage. If she wants a family and you can't give it to her she should know before she chooses to tie the knot. You should have had that conversation while talking about getting engaged. 

Even if you somehow just spaced it for forever, you should definitely have told her as soon as she first mentioned ""trying"" etc. I just can't imagine how you didn't have that conversation the first time you discussed having unprotected sex. Potential for pregnancy is something most women are aware of and thinking about during all sex, but especially if she's off the pill and you're not wearing a condom.

I'm really trying to see it from your perspective man, but I just can't see any honest way you could have missed saying that without knowingly leading her on at best, or straight up lying to her at worst."

AmItheAsshole,fqmj7pa,t3_gjdxqi,1589478333.0,"NTA I've got a bachelor's in psychology. If your friend had tried to tell you to follow your psychiatrist's advice and you been the one to disagree disagreed or had even expressed concern or distrust about medication that would be one thing. But allowing their distrust to make them contradict a psychiatrist is the issue. 

I have told people about reservations I have about some specific medications (looking at you lithium) but I would never tell them to stop taking a prescribed medication without a lot of evidence that it wasn't working well and even then I'd suggest they schedule a med check with their psychiatrist. (In some states psychologists can prescribe as well and in more states they make the med recommendation and the psychiatrists basically verifies and signs it.)

I admit that comment would hurt me too, but it would start me down a good path. Did you cut them harshly, yes, did they need it if they wanted to pursue a career in the field of mental health, also yes.

Psychiatrists are medical doctors with psychological training. Your friend with a bachelor's degree isn't even a psychologist. It's true that the bachelor's degree teaches most of the background and a master's/PhD teaches the practice, but that doesn't mean a bachelor's level graduate can do anything other than express opinion."

He has seen a professional therapist and been tested (autism testing in adults is subjective and they basically just rule out other things since we have no tests for autism specifically scaled to adults.) and was told that he could get the diagnosis but that it would only serve to make it difficult to get a job. Because he's higher functioning he would be diagnosed aspergers under the old DSM, but the current one lumps that in with autism making a lot of people avoid the formal diagnosis even if they have the unofficial one.

She texted her mom who basically said well duh, we just didn't tell you because we didn't want you using it as a crutch. So my wife basically spent 20 years of her life thinking that physically and emotionally debilitating panic attacks were normal and that everyone else was just better than her at coping with them.

Anyway, that was a bit of a rant, but the context was important. She isn't the bully ever, but she does think I ""pull stuff out of my ass sometimes"" and often doesn't believe me.

I've always been socially awkward etc. The last few years it's almost as if for 20 years the fuse was burning and now it's gone. I just don't have patience for people being stupid. Politics has me mad at everyone, religious intolerance has me mad at everyone, social issues have me and at everyone. I've just felt like every time someone talks they're always missing half or more of whatever story they're telling people. Social media is killing me, but if I leave the idiots on ""both"" sides win. Like somehow it's my responsibility in my head to correct false info, or to present opposing arguments, or to explain when people use logical fallacies. Now even my wife tells me ""this is why I say you shouldn't talk"" and all I can think about is how much I want to just tear the world apart. Somehow aggression seems to be the only answer because being polite gets me ignored and people can sometimes just go f*** themselves.

DestinyTheGame,fp53zzm,t3_gbbtu9,1588315567.0,"So as someone who has studied stats and data presentation extensively they did a good job of hiding a crucial piece of information. Hunters are being punished for having been active players all along and Titans are being rewarded for having not been active. 

They took the number of active toons for each class from the previous month and divided the number of medals earned by that number. So Hunter medals are worthless because they've always been active.(Admit it, you see them everywhere.) Titans had a low activity rate in the month prior and so when they flooded back in their medals were weighted super high since the value was being divided by a small number of initially active players. Hunters got no such luck. And of course Warlocks make sense. They have a slight decrease after earning all the content from last release and then jump back a bit when there is something to do. Hunters have given up because they are being weighted so low and the drops from the event suck. Titans are just excited to have any excuse to brag about how awesome they are and how everyone else sucks and does nothing but whine and ""shoulder charge isn't overpowered in crucible, you just suck."""
