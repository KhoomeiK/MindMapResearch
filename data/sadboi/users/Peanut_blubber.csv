Not sure how many hours/days/weeks I spent just driving around, listening to YouTube videos sending me messages and looking at mailboxes (I was convinced the position of someone's mailbox would reveal whether they were marked for extermination).

Overall very dark and scary time, but highly invigorating. I felt like I had an extremely important purpose -- a feeling I certainly miss. Somehow miraculously I maintained my professional job through all of this. Then I got depressed and went to a psychiatrist (although I wish I had sooner instead of waiting. I felt like damaged goods for a while after the episode).

On meds now and all is right except I'm depressed as a motherfucker. It's gotta turn around soon though."
