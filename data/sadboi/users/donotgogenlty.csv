This is really sad, he was basically out of the woods but was probably not given medication to manage the inflammation (IL-6 inhibitors, etc) and must have developed heart failure due to his own immune response. There needs to be wider recognition of medications which prevent damaging inflammation modulated by the body's response to the virus and manage cytokine release. This may have been preventable.

Yes, HCQ is a Zinc ionophore. You can't just give it to a patient who's having cytokine storm (usually the stage where ARDS presents itself and needs intubation).

Anything you give them overwhelms their ability to even process it and it can be debated that it actually leads to a quicker death, like a domino effect.
