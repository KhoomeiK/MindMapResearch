BipolarReddit,ewlfj7e,t3_cods30,1565521823.0,"Makes sense! I have this guy that is sexually harassing me at work and I lied to my parents and just told him he got fired. A big step was telling my therapist I lied to my parents. 

Another example is in 2015 I got divorced. I saw my psychiatrist a few days after we signed the paperwork. When she asked me how I was doing I said fine nothing new lol. 

I dont know why I carry around shame OR try to act like I have my shit together when Iâ€™m paying someone $145 for 30 minutes to write me a prescription. Ugh

I guess acknowledging it and admitting to it to strangers on Reddit is the first step."
