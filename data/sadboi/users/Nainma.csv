I can see how it would seem awkward being in someone's house but a lot of the time I'm doing it for people who have had cleaners majority of their adult lives so they're used to it. They're more cautious of leaving out questionable items and some won't even leave much mess for you because they care about what you think of their house. So I feel like there's a shared understanding there.

Don't know if that helps you feel better about getting a cleaner or not! If you find a good one, they're not going to judge you for needing a cleaner or anything like that. We're there to clean your house and to help you keep it looking excellent."

This was over a few weeks whenever she was home. I very quickly went from supportive friend to apparently, an unsupportive horrible person who lacked empathy.

But this cycle was particuarly bad and leading up to my period I was struggling with severe boredom outside of work and the loneliness made me feel like I couldn't enjoy my time off because I had no one to enjoy it with, and that meant that I was a pathetic and worthless person and nobody likes me and so on, so forth. (Trust me, people definitely like me and I know this) It was annoying though as I really enjoy having my weekends to myself and making the most of my time off. I had also been getting strong thoughts of self harm leading up to and during my period but they've become a bit like empty threats especially because of the improvement in my mood the last few days if that makes sense. It's like I get the urge to self harm but I'm aware of how illogical it would be and how I'll just regret it later (that's thanks to therapy and coping mechanisms).

It doesn't go away until I make it back to my car. 


It's also triggered by drinking alcohol so as soon as I start to feel tipsy I'll begin to depersonalize. In a social setting I'll keep talking and appearing to be with it but I'll feel like I'm drifting into a dream state. I have to drink water or leave the room entirely to snap back to reality.
