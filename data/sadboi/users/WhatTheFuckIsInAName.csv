I’m stuck with my mother due to COVID-19, so healing is a little hard when she’s basically retraumatizing me every day, I’m more focused on survival. But it helps to hear things like this. I have to remember that she can’t force me to feel a certain way. Even if she thinks she can. She can’t force me to give her that reaction. 
Right now I can’t forgive her. I can only pity that she’s such a sad and miserable person, that she threw away all of her chances at getting to know her daughter as a person. She’ll never know the person I am becoming. And that’s sad. I can feel sad for her without needing to fix her. She has to fix herself, and that’s the really sad part, because I know she never will.

Even to this day I just want my parents to see how they hurt me and apologize, but they won’t. They refuse to listen and if I push, I get the same words back: “Why are you dragging up the past” “Why can’t you let things go” “I was a terrible mother, is that what you want to hear?” “You’re so sensitive I can’t say ANYTHING around you”"

I literally have always thought I was asexual because I could never once picture myself engaging in the act with a man without feelings of disgust, literally like imagining myself in bed with one and touching him even just like....on the shoulder or something is like....euuugh...but then I think about doing that with a woman and while i still have the self-esteem and body issues, mentally I’m a lot more “huh, I think i could be down for that”"

I did this recently with my childhood PS2, and realized that the experience I enjoyed was heavily coated with nostalgia. I’ll always treasure those memories, but I can’t get them back by playing the actual discs anymore. Which, as others have said, are prone to degradation and corruption. 

That said, many people consider them to be collector’s items, or important pieces of history, and it’s up to you to decide how much you value them.

And in the process of trying to heal from that, trying to gain a clearer picture of my childhood...stops cold with the N-Parent, because she can’t look back at it either, in case she sees something that would expose her for the less-than-perfect mom she knows she is, deep down. 

Once, I asked my NMom what she remembered about the day I was born. I asked in good faith, I was not trying to manipulate a response out of her. I wanted to hear a story from a time I could not possibly remember, the beginning of my life. Who is not curious to hear a story like that? But just asking her was like I told her to go lick shit off the floor. She was completely angry and disgusted. “I don’t know, I was on a lot of painkillers.” “Why are you asking me this?” “What do you want from me?” ...her reaction hurt me, in the moment. But when I went back and though about it later I realized that she reacted like this because the guilt she feels deep down over motherhood started the day I was born, and she can’t separate those feelings from the actual events. So she saw me asking about those memories as a plot to dredge up dirt against her. Which is so twisted and sad. I’m still hurt about it, but mostly I just feel sad for her. And scared for myself, because I can see that I employ a lot of her defense mechanisms. When an emotion is too hard for me to face I sometimes lash out or run away. I am trying not to become her."

- Very very intense female friendships as a kid, and never more than one at a time. I was a serial best-friend-er. I was always crushed when these relationships “fizzled” i.e. the girl probably got tired of my laser focus and wanted a more normal friendship. At least, I can only assume.
- Preoccupation with the few out lesbians I did know in real life, but always too afraid to ever talk to them or let them know I existed. I feel like they could smell it on me somehow, as a few of them teased me. 
- Someone else said it on here, but: skipping ahead in straight porn whenever it was about pleasing the man. But, I also don’t like it when lesbian porn is obviously for male pleasure, either, because it seems so fake.
- There were more than a few instances where I was point-blank asked if I was gay as a teen. My own mother, some of my best friends...I denied it each time, offended that my lack of interest in boys somehow equated to being gay. This is a big one, looking back on it.
- Dating boys was always something I felt like I ‘had’ to do, still do kinda, it’s never that I see a guy I’m attracted to and wish he’d notice me, or desire to go after him, it’s usually that there’s a willing guy there and it seems like a convenient way to ‘get it done’...of course, the reality is usually after a few dates the shine of it wears off and I once again convince myself that I’m just undate-able, unloveable, and unable to feel desire.
- “Jokingly” cuddling and holding hands with my female friends. And of course the truth or dare games, “Haha dare you to kiss me”
- Getting really into yaoi/gay porn as what I now see as a sort of total avoidance of the female body. It was the perfect way to address sexuality without ever having to think about MY sexuality.
- Being, in the very early 2000’s, a super woke/invested LGBTQ+ ally, knowing all about what was up with the political scene with gay activism, consuming a lot of gay media, seeking out any media that portayed queer relationships, and getting super offended and passionate whenever someone made a disparaging comment about gays. But no, I’m straight, I just care a lot about civil rights."
latebloomerlesbians,f9ljm48,t1_f9lcttb,1575424714.0,"This is sort of my path to realization as well and what I’m going through currently. I call myself bisexual despite sort of...kind of deep down feeling like I’m a lesbian, only because I have such deep depression I never could imagine being successfully with a man OR a woman, so I figured it didn’t matter what I really desired. This is despite consistently seeking out women, wanting to be around women, feeling secure with women, whereas with men I always rejected them even when they were interested in me and I could admit they were objectively attractive. It’s funny how deep denial goes even if we think we’re ‘open’."
startrek,f9fcja8,t3_e4tz04,1575266403.0,"I agree. Star Trek is definitely a sort of coping tool/warm blanket for me and it’s part of my routine to watch an episode to destress. I find different series are great for different moods...I watch DS9 when I want to get swept up in a story, TOS when I want to feel nostalgic, TNG when I want something soothing on in the background while I cook..."

She just exploded on my tonight saying I haven’t been pulling my weight and making her do all the housework......the fuck, a week ago you were saying don’t worry about it I just want you to get better!"

Anxiety,f5oflwv,t3_doc2xx,1572316873.0,"This could not be more relevant. I just got back from the doctors where I got a referral to a cardiologist. 

He gave it to me in spite of me having three EKGs and blood work done in the last two months and all of them coming back normal and the reason, he said, was “I think it’s just anxiety, and I think you know it’s just anxiety, but I think it’s not going to stop giving you anxiety until you go see a cardiologist and have someone who is an expert on heart health tell you that nothing is wrong with your heart”

I didn’t feel condescended to, in fact it was very validating that he understood how my anxiety worked and what I needed. 

Full disclosure we also talked about seeing a therapist and anxiety medication so I it probably helped that I showed I was working on the anxiety thing too."
raisedbynarcissists,f5odzz1,t3_doipyg,1572315765.0,"Holy carp, are you me? This was pretty much my exact family dynamic growing up, including the making fun of children (my dad did this too, but they would both judge *children* and make comments on their clothes or weight).

We lived near the ocean and would often be at the beach, my mother would *only* ever just sit and sunbathe and I have memories of begging and pleading her to build a sandcastle with me or going into the water and just like your story, she had a thousand and one reasons why she wouldn’t. Tiny, dumb reasons, but it wasn’t just the beach, it was *everywhere* and *always*.

My mother was also abused as a child and also rarely laughs unless it’s at someone’s expense (it is frequently mine, she is always mocking the way I look or sound or act). 

But your post made me remember so many moments at different places,  I’d look over to find my mother sitting, stone-cold in a chair by herself, unsmiling, while everyone else was joining in and having fun. Now that cell phones are a thing, it’s even worse, because she just disappears hunched over into her phone."
raisedbynarcissists,f5oca6i,t3_doi3tz,1572314674.0,"I’m 30 now but looking back on my high school days, all of my friends came from abuse families one way or the other even if we didn’t realize it at the time. And yes, it was as you say."
Anxiety,f5oa6g2,t1_f5kn8fl,1572313325.0,"I lost a great job this year, mostly as a result of my anxiety, and the only silver lining was that I could then qualify for Medicaid. It’s been really hard to find a good doctor, let alone a mental health worker, with how overburdened the system is, so it took me WEEKS AND WEEKS but I finally have a prescription for something and am on the right path to finding a therapist. 

No, it wasn’t easy. Yes, I choked up and panicked while talking to the doctors. I cried and leaked snot everywhere and felt stupid and scared while trying to tell them what I needed. But I had to do it it, because the alternative was me living with my mental illnesses wearing me down until there is nothing left and I don’t have any other options but the permanent one. When thought about in that way, I will take the former option easily."
