If your sex life is stale now imagine how it‚Äôll be when you guys have a kid? Do you really wanna be with someone long term when they‚Äôre not even committed to making sure you‚Äôre happy? Not just emotionally/physically but SEXUALLY as well? If someone is right for you they‚Äôll hit all the blocks not just one or two.
