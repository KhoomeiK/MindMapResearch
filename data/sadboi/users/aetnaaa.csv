AskWomen,fqvkzda,t1_fqueh5m,1589679509.0,He said that’s NORMAL? Girl get you a man that tries to win you and please you everyday like it’s the first time......the fact that he won’t do it even when you ask is kind of a red flag. If your sex life is stale now imagine how it’ll be when you guys have a kid? Do you really wanna be with someone long term when they’re not even committed to making sure you’re happy? Not just emotionally/physically but SEXUALLY as well? If someone is right for you they’ll hit all the blocks not just one or two. Besides......there are some people that have been married for 10+ years and their sex life is still great.......

Heard it ding. Didn’t get it tho because I was staring at the wall. At nighttime I talk to myself/the universe and talk about my problems. I ramble to the point where I don’t even know what the fuck I’m talking about. Yesterday I got so frustrated I grabbed my sketchbook and started drawing. I zoned out and started scribbling everywhere over and over and over again until the page was just covered in black scribbles and started stabbing my pencil into the page.

You are most definitely not doing anything to help sexual assault victims ESPECIALLY male victims. They already have a hard time as it is.
