**CAPS Mental Health Services and Slug Support**

[Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://caps.ucsc.edu/news/caps-spring-quarter-services.html) has many online services, including individual counseling, psychiatric services, online groups and workshops, mental health crisis services, the Let's Talk drop-in program, and free online resources for students. As a reminder, you have access to CAPS services through your student fees, not UC SHIP. However,[ UC SHIP and CruzCare](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/ucship-cruzcare-offcampus-cancel.html) also covers students no matter where they are. 

For CAPS, contact (831) 459-2628 and speak with one of the staff to make an appointment. Students can get access to video appointments quickly and, in many cases, be seen for extended treatment. On evenings and weekends, CAPS has an after-hours service that will put you in contact with a live mental health professional. Call the main number at (831) 459-2628 and press 3. This can be particularly helpful to students in different time zones and students needing support in a crisis. Slug Support is available for immediate basic needs and other emergency situations via phone at (831) 459-4446, Zoom, and email at deanofstudents@ucsc.edu. 

CAPS also has an extensive list of[ online resources](https://caps.ucsc.edu/managing-coronavirus-stress.html) on our website, including meditations, relaxation exercises, and online therapy assistance. And if you are comfortable working remotely with a therapist who is not CAPS-affiliated, you can also find a therapist through[ LiveHealth Online](https://caps.ucsc.edu/pdf/livehealth-online-flyer-041519.pdf).

 It's important to have friends that question your motivations but this just comes off as shallow. Race doesn't define who you are inside, it's what you do that defines you, your body is simply a vessel.   


So find people who treat you with the care and compassion you would receive from a good family member and disregard those who are unwilling to look past their own bias and are about as deep as a bowl of cereal. Of course, give people chances but not to the extent of the cost of your own character, find someone that lifts that character up...which will be difficult at 20yo."

Lenovo,fnpawom,t3_g35691,1587142295.0,"TL;DR: It sounds like a software issue. Reinstall windows. If that doesn't work, it's time to get a new computer.  


Lenovo laptops are not secure.  
Lenovo has a reputation for harvesting user data, ref: superfish, and that it's owned through majority shares by The Chinese Academy of Sciences.  


the c940 does not run well with linux distros either lots of problems with the transition from computer to tablet mode. Arch and subsequently Manjaro have said they have gotten the speakers working...however it is still only partial. Similar with the fingerprint reader and there is alot of steps involved in downloading drivers/make files.  
Fedora is in a similar position as well. the X series has support for Linux, but not the yoga series.  


The Tor Browser is not as secure as many people opting to act as relay nodes harvest user information. Just use firefox or if you need that extra security I2P, as they randomize routing with zero fixed points to attack."
