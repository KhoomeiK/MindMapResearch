depression,fk5ac0m,t3_fge6hs,1583876548.0,It sounds as though you have a family are really care about you and are keen to see you well again. They sound a little overbearing but that is much better than not being bothered about you. I have been to see a number of psychiatrists and although they have not been so helpful to me they are to many people. The point I want to make is that all the psychiatrists have been human beings and not at all to be worried about seeing. They will ask you a lot of questions about your life but that is to help them to determine how best they can help you. Try to go with them and be open that way you are more likely to get the treatment best suited  to your needs. They may recommend medication. If they do take it as prescribed for the period prescribed that way you will really know whether it has worked for you. It may need later change or adjustment. But medication is not the only route. They might suggest some kind of talking therapy like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or something else of that nature. Whatever they suggest give it a chance. It may not work at first but if you stick at it then it might. If it doesn't they will suggest something else. Don't be surprised if they suggest more than one treatment. My message go! And though you will probably worry it will not be anywhere as bad  I think you fear. All the best for a quick recovery.
depression,fhi3od4,t1_fhi2hin,1581617174.0,"I must reply to this. If your mother and partner break up it will not be because of you. A real, true, solid, loving relationship can stand the odd knock or face up to a difficult situation. It sounds to me that the relationship is flimsy and in that case, if it is not broken by one thing it will be broken by another. They both should be supporting you in a positive way and they are clearly not. So their problems are not your fault. Love your mum by all means but you have to love yourself also. I heard some advice recently which was, ""look after yourself as though you were looking after someone else' We often neglect ourselves in ways that we would not neglect someone who was in our care. Care for yourself and the very best to you."
depression,fhi27gg,t1_fhhfprq,1581616360.0,"You are not a loser. You are just starting out on life it is way too early to make those judgements about yourself. You need to see a doctor and to immediately start on medication. I take several types of anti-depressant and to types of anti anxiety. I hold down a responsible job despite the struggles and fights with myself and there is no way it makes me a Zombie. I am sorry your family behave as they do. It sounds like a poisonous situation. You must, must seek a doctor's help and be medicated. Then to try to get away from family get out and walk. I know it sounds so hard but you can do it. As you walk just notice your surroundings, have a conversation in your head about what you see. I have had  depression 40+ years and when it begins to overwhelm me I walk - after I have been to the doctor. The family you live with are wrong, wrong, wrong. Take no notice. At least try what I have suggested and I pray it works for you."
depression,ffutyv0,t3_ev5g5g,1580249294.0,"I have been in exactly that place. At the moment the first two hours of a day are hell then when the medication kicks in the horrible feeling lifts just a little. Only then am I able to remind myself that I only have the moment for sure and the future probably. I tell myself regrets and looking back is pointless. Sometimes I am able to convince myself other times not. But it is true and it is worth reminding yourself even if you don't always succeed in convincing yourself. And remember, look after yourself like you were looking after someone else or at least just try to."
depression,ffit7th,t3_etqbpl,1579982123.0,"I am sorry to hear this. People like the people who write on this forum know the truth about depression and know you are not faking it. Sadly you need to distance yourself from these people and, I would say, also from the person or persons who disclosed this information to you as they did you no favours."
depression,ffcvu4e,t3_esqc7z,1579808324.0,"I am not exactly like that no. What I find is that when I am particularly depressed I avoid conversations at all costs and if I unavoidably get into one I am rude in making my excuses and get out of it. Having depression ruins one's life, but I guess you experience that. It's no consolation but you are not on your own."
depression,fezzgwa,t3_eqs4h8,1579463543.0,"I can relate entirely to what you have written. I have had various degrees of depression for in excess of 40 years. All I can say for myself is this. I have tried so much medication (still taking loads) all so many psychiatrists it is unreal, but nothing has worked. I am always depressed but do have better days than others. First I have accepted who I am and that it is not my fault. People who don't accept who I am can sod off. Then on my better days I try to do something when I am having a better day and that gives me some satisfaction. We are born with depression, people generally don't understand but the people writing on this forum do. We have to just do our best and support and congratulate each other in forums such as this. So sod their silly comments we understand mate. Bless you."
depression,fen72rt,t3_epydpj,1579278402.0,I don't know what country you are from but here is the UK we have gone through the protracted battle of Brexit and believing so deeply in the remain argument the frustration and disappointment has done me no good. I can totally understand where you are coming from. People like us have no control anyway what ever system you live in and we are only kidding ourselves to think that we do. So good on you. Give it up. And when you feel well enough to give it attention again you will find that for you little has changed! There might be a different government but for you little will have changed.
depression,fekkrmi,t1_fekk5u3,1579202099.0,You are right. The problem is I often volunteer for things stupidly just to try and 'keep in' with people. Then I find I can't do the task either quick enough or well enough. I know I have to have a word with myself!
depression,fekj7vs,t3_epe2m7,1579201176.0,Yes I can relate totally. Everything is an enormous effort and I am always falling below people's expectations because of the things I have not managed to do. I have been building a workshop for three years now and that has become a running joke amongst the people I know. They don't appreciate that having stuck at it for three years has taken an enormous amount of effort. And like you I am surrounded by people but have no support. I have been depressed so long I have no real friends as nobody wants to be friends with an old depressive. I do try my best to be positive but it is a huge effort.
depression,fe5qz2d,t3_eno7v3,1578873289.0,"Jesus himself said 'in this life you will have troubles'. St Paul admitted to having a 'thorn in his side' that he had prayed would go away but it had not done so. There are Christians such as myself who have prayed and prayed for their depression to leave them but I can tell you it has not done so. I have realised that my illness is something I am going to have to live with as a Christian.  And so I want to say explore Christianity by all means, I wish you would. Don't let well meaning but ignorant people put you off."
depression,fdlnao3,t1_fdjqyzi,1578527903.0,I completely understand what you are saying everything I see with myself including your last comments. No choice really but to carry on.
depression,fdf4135,t3_ekxc8k,1578352805.0,"I know I have been in that place. I am suffering from depression but not at that very low point at the moment. I just want to reach out and say I understand. My experience is that time does change how we feel but, when we are in those deep troughs we don't or can't believe it and we panic like hell which makes it all worse. Try to hold on to whatever hope you can muster."
depression,fdeql95,t3_ekwbox,1578344549.0,"Yes I have been depressed to varying degrees for over 40 years. I have visited a number of psychiatrists and taken all the medications for depression. Nothing works. There can be something actually positive and liberating in concluding that you are unlikely to ever be fully well. I am resolved to use the time that I am not feeling so bad more positively. That is not to say my life is not pretty shitty,

 it is. And I am a pain to myself and those close to me, but I do get some things done just to keep my head above water. I have concluded that this is the best I am likely to achieve."
depression,fd0ruck,t3_ejamne,1578122906.0,Yes I can relate to that. Years ago I could cry but now I cannot. I have to say however that when I did cry the release was short lived. Even so it is strange that the ability to cry does go over time and a kind of numbness sets in.
depression,fc9x0vf,t1_fc9e26q,1577559454.0,"You miss the point. A depressed person would dearly love to be working those long hours and gaining worldly success but they can't because they are depressed. There is an implication in what you write that the depressed person has a choice but they do not. Like you can't climb a hill with a half tom lead weight on your back though you would dearly love to do so, so you struggle to achieve in life with the weight of depression."
depression,fc2nqya,t1_fc1jkvd,1577368422.0,"Yes you will improve over time stick at it. I speak as someone who has been there and still returns there from time to time. Push yourself but don't expect too much. A shower and a walk are a great start. Try passing the time of day with people and even reading the paper, anything that get's you interacting with the outside world. God bless your efforts."
depression,fbb3n82,t1_fbamyhy,1576692617.0,"You say your ""parents deserve a better child"". I read what you have written totally understanding what you are saying given that I have suffered depression for many years. However when I got to ""parents deserve a better child"", I had to reply to you. As a parent of young adults one still at university, I will bet that your parents love you dearly and unconditionally. The question of what they deserve will never arise in their minds, they have you and will love you whatever your view of yourself. Just do what you can at University, you can have no idea of what opportunities my open up to you although I do understand that you do feel as you do. Depression distorts reality. I understand that your country is not always as you would wish it to be, neither is mine (UK) but it will climb out of it's current phase and good men and women will win in the end. For now just do sufficient to hang on in with your studies. Don't expect too much of yourself."
depression,fb8rvvb,t3_ebvuwk,1576620485.0,"If you are able try to get out and walk. Just look around and notice things, try not to ruminate on problems. You may not feel any better immediately but keep doing this and there is a chance with time the sadness will ease back just a little but by sufficient to make a small difference to build on. This is what I do when I find myself deep in the pit of emptiness and with nobody to support me. It has worked a little for me. I hope it might help you. I am sorry that things are tough at the moment but time does change things."
PoliticalDiscussion,fb64g8m,t3_eaau9f,1576541137.0,Don't worry puzzled American we are not about to sell our NHS off to you nor adopt US style food regulations. It's 'Fake News' as your smart Commander in Chief likes to say. I have also not missed the snide comments about Britain's role and economic power. Lets reserve judgement until a little time has passed. Might I suggest we wait 10 years before we try to dance on what we think is the corpse.
worldnews,fb1yg89,t3_eaxdgq,1576442975.0,Conversion therapy how does that work?
depression,fahxlzx,t3_e97egy,1576095609.0,"My friend depression is very real I have suffered from it for 40 years and it has very much affected every aspect of my life. I understand what you are saying about people brushing it off and then when someone takes their own life those same people say 'oh if I only had known'. But look, it is how it is and we just can't change it. There are times when I can do nothing as the depression pervades my whole being. However there are days when it is less acute and on those days I force myself to do something like my part time job! When I push myself I find it gets easier and on those days I have small wins, not as much as I would like but small wins nevertheless. This way I have a little of normality around me. It is hard sometimes F\*\*\*\*\*g hard but we have to try. There is nothing else for it. I wish you all the best and be sure there are people who understand it is just a matter of finding them!"
depression,f9k82hp,t3_e5a1lk,1575394854.0,I can totally relate to this. As someone who has carried depression for at least 40 years. The point is that nobody around you can understand it unless they they have experienced it. That is maybe why you have a particular love or connection with the people you know share your experience. Good on yer!
