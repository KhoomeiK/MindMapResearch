BPD,fepxnaw,t1_fepkeuz,1579334204.0,"Same.

I go into full-blown panic attacks when somebody sighs or shows signs of irritation, even if I know 100% that it isn't because of me. Even if everything's perfect, I have an unshakeable feeling that everybody resents me; everything remotely negative is just proof of that.

Emotions suck, lol."
BPD,fepiz76,t3_eqbj0k,1579321717.0,"Tbh the examples you gave seem pretty obviously condescending vs. supportive; I'll freak out over way less, lol. 

It's why people refer to relationships with pwBPD as ""walking on eggshells."" The difference between ""good morning"" and ""good morning!"" or the slightest variation in inflection (""hEY"" vs ""Hey"") can cause disproportionate emotional reactions.

My FP smiled at me this morning and I had to calm myself down for a second because my first thought was ""she usually smiles more excitedly, maybe she hates me."""
BPD,fepi0oi,t1_feosact,1579321011.0,"It is terrifying, but if he's acting disrespectfully and it's having this large of a negative impact on your life, then you deserve better and will be happier without him.

It'll hurt. But it sounds like it already hurts. And there will be somebody out there who's better."

BPD,fdy3khh,t1_fdxb2q1,1578775704.0,"Exactly. My 20's were terrible, but I'm 27 now, and things are finally... good. I think I'm comfortable using that word now."
BPD,fdwkenj,t3_en8kc5,1578759629.0,"Life can be terrible and frightening and I understand why you feel the way you do.

It does get better. I promise. You will find beauty and joy. It will be hard, but it's worth it to keep fighting. There are people who you can talk to, and you have a whole community here who understands your pain.

But you can't give up everything in your future trying to chase a reset button that doesn't exist."

BPD,fcwvluc,t3_ejad2s,1578039471.0,"I used to do that a lot when I was a teenager.
For me, it was a combination of an attention-seeking behavior, splitting, and an attempt to cope with dissociation.

It was almost always because of insecurity over someone I was fixated on at the time: jealousy, slights, feeling ignored, or whatever.
These insecurities usually caused me to enter emotional spirals. I'd delete my social media because I didn't want to see that person anymore (in that moment), I wanted to commit social suicide over it, and I simultaneously hoped that maybe they'd notice and would give me sympathy for it. Then I'd reactivate it because I knew it was abusive to expect them to feel sorry for me, I didn't want to lose contact with them, and I didn't want to lose my social life and the other people I cared about. This would go back and forth multiple times over hours or days. 
Typical bpd stuff.

As I got older, the urge to do this shifted to me just unfriending/re-adding that specific person (which is a much faster way to get blocked, lol), to eventually getting control over it all. (Mostly.)

For me, the biggest thing was identifying the cause of it (insecurity over FPs). I then tried to avoid situations that would trigger me until I could, eventually, accept these triggers and learn to control my reactions to them.
I'm still working on it, and it's taken a few years, but admitting why I did these things was the most important step. I haven't had the benefit of therapy, so that may make it easier, too. 

I dunno if that helps at all."
BPD,fcv3mx9,t3_eiywo8,1577993964.0,"I asked a crush out awhile ago. When she said yes I had more energy and excitement than a 5-year-old on a sugar high.

Of course, after a few hours I crashed back down when I started to retreat into my ""people don't actually like me obviously this isn't real"" mentality.

I think when it's event based like this it isn't a form of mania, just mild elation that gets magnified like every other emotion with bpd. But I'm not a psychologist."
niceguys,f9vnr16,t1_f9une59,1575675015.0,It's supposed to. It's the same reason incels use words like femoid. It's dehumanizing.
niceguys,f9tumry,t1_f9tt1p1,1575639005.0,"In short, it's the expression of genetic characteristics (genotype). I think incels use it to mean looks or body structure, but it's weird because literally everything about you is a phenotype, so it's pretty meaningless."
niceguys,f8uos56,t1_f8u3gat,1574837180.0,"I always read it as the emoji equivalent of ""meh,"" or ""I don't know what to tell you.""

It's dismissive, but I wouldn't say it's confrontational in its dismissiveness."
