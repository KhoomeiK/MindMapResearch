For starters, Native American themes and aesthetics were *all the rage* just a few decades ago. Disney always adapts folklore to suit children, but the reason they chose Pocahontas at all is because Americans love that shit. Native American accessories, outfits, scouts lessons, toys, games, movies  etc. The same Americans *still* love that shit, but thanks to pc culture its not okay to go around making Native themed things for ""fun"".

Native Americans actually still push it super hard, in their products, art culture and media. But the white folk with all the media conglomerates now have to think to twice about using it.

Expedition mode gives you limited number of lives thats shared between everyone. When someone dies the lives drain continuously until theyre revived. Its actually pretty brutal, but yokai realms restore a bit of it.

Warframe,fq0n94q,t1_fpz0q35,1589034630.0,"Because its clearly not a war scythe, I said it can be used like one moveset wise because it has a double edged blade, where the outer edge makes it a regular polearm like a glaive, axe or wae scythe.  Were talking about movesets. Are you here to discuss WF or did you just want to be right about something?"
Warframe,fpybjz8,t1_fpy7src,1589000572.0,"Again, the dokrahm blade functions as the end of a polearm due to the double edge and would be used in the same way as a poleaxe, glaive, war scythe etc. My point is that theres no excuse for how uninspired the scythe movesets are. They dont have the reach and arcing swings of the realistic war scythe, nor the reaping motion of the scythe tool/fantasy scythe"
Warframe,fpxi94q,t1_fpxhqiu,1588983128.0,The dokrahm is sharp on both sides (its also an axehead) letting it function like it has a straight edge. Movesets are still lame. Theyre especially missing the actual sickle reaping motion if we're talking realism
Warframe,fpx7f3i,t1_fpwpn7y,1588977109.0,">entirely realistic 

Were talkin about Warframe here tho. 

>war scythe 

Thats the dokrahm to a T. Still horribly utilized"
