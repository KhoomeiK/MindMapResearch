conspiracy,fpwb5aw,t3_gflljv,1588960367.0,Cheers and I drink to that.
SuicideWatch,fpwaq25,t3_gfvnse,1588960159.0,"I also feel the same here, and I hate those quotes that say something like 'Stop waiting for someone to save you.' or 'Stop waiting to be rescued and make your own life'. That's bullshit humans need each other. Imagine telling that to someone who's about to Jump on a cliff to commit suicide. Maybe there is some truth to it but not everyone has energy to overcome, get up and get shit sorted out.  
Am sorry man and I hope something good comes along to cheer you up."
ForeverAlone,fpl2i6r,t3_gds1ax,1588705214.0,Thank you for the truth. We need more of that please.
ForeverAlone,fnp8xso,t3_g2w1rx,1587141303.0,This gave me a good laugh ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Thank you I needed it.
conspiracy,fmxe90r,t3_fxoq60,1586463355.0,So what do they do with the data they collect?
SuicideBereavement,fmi8gjb,t3_fv8fuf,1586104522.0,Hey! Thank you for sharing.
Coronavirus,fjkt7hy,t3_fdwg6v,1583433422.0,I guess he's been waiting for some time to use that. Finally the chance came.
SuicideWatch,ffqrqjs,t3_euo34a,1580142120.0,"Am so sorry. It's not your fault. Think about what your sister could have wanted. If she was here am pretty sure she would have wanted you to keep on living and be happy. She would tell that accidents happen and that don't blame yourself for what happened. Your suicide failed for a reason.
So hold onto life for your sisters sake. Of course getting rid of this negativity is difficult. Am disappointed with your parents because they are the ones who should emotionally support and help you move on instead blaming you. I hope find something that will make you heal your pain. 
So please hold onto it."
ForeverAlone,f1e7ugu,t3_d8w00r,1569415345.0,Yeah man. You are not alone. It will drain all that stress and anxiety in you and leave you calm.
ForeverAlone,f0q5y2t,t3_d65vw8,1568854470.0,How old are you? Are both your parents still alive?Do you have brothers and sisters? How is your relationship with your family and friends? Do they love you or hate you? Ever been in a relationship?
ForeverAlone,f0q3jwh,t3_d62yr0,1568853225.0,"I loose concentration shortly after I start reading. So I don't read. But mostly I just listen my sad songs, watch movies and sleep. A lot of sleep."
ForeverAlone,f0q2f6m,t3_d65bb4,1568852601.0,"tried to be be honest with a girl I liked, told her how I felt and she laughed so hard that it drained all the confidence I had in me. Upto now I'm still wondering why she Did that.
So I've made a promise myself that I will never do that again. I won't flirt with women , I just be acting like I don't give a shit about them no matter how pretty.
So should you. Love yourself. Do things you love. if you hate your job work on getting one that makes you feel a sense of accomplishment."
ForeverAlone,f0pyllq,t3_d63707,1568850494.0,Yeah. Me too. And when am talking to people it feels like am just forcing myself.
