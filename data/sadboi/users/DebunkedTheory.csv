Now that landscape, and many others around the world where sheep and other hoofstock are left to graze, is 99% grass. No trees, no flowers. Just grass. 

Without them there would be flowers, that would bring in more insects on which birds, bats and other animals could feed. Amongst the flowers would grow trees in which the birds can nest and beneath which mammals can shelter. The trees also filter rainwater from the soil which reduces flooding and stops erosion. All of this isn't only good for wildlife it's good for people too. It's good to have not just lots of animals, but a variety of species. It's good for crops, the soil, the waterways and the atmosphere.
