I just think so much of what you’re saying is anecdotal. There are shitty and very good public schools and I don’t know if we can really say “most private schools are better academically” because my state is known for having excellent schools as a whole. Of course public schools tend to have larger enrollments and such but the education I got at mine was great.

I get WHY Leah is the way she is but I do think she would cheat on another partner if she had the chance and was unhappy and would find a way to make it okay in her head, even if she does come clean about it."
