I can recognize and distinguish Michael Jackson's Billy Jean from any other song starting with the same four on the floor groove just by hearing the first two beats of the kick (and snare).

And just think about drone music. Drone relies so heavily on timbre, it can't be notated, it can't be translated... A piece of drone music certainly can't be recognized if performed with different sounds than that of the original recording. 

How we define music is constantly changing and evolving. I argue it can't really be defined. Or maybe, but not as an object, but rather as an activity. I digress."

In arrangement view: If you have the same clip duplicated so that the clips are seperated from one another, you won't be able to make changes quickly to them all. What you can do is to drag out the first clip in your arrangement so that it overwrites all the seperated clips. Now, click on the long clip you just made and make sure the 'loop' function is active. When you make a change in the midi clip, this change will be applied to the entire looped clip. From there on, if you want to make a change to just one section of this clip you will have to make the bars you want to change and slice the clips (ctr + e on Windows).

I recommend reading through the manual and trying out all the functions as you read along. It will save you a lot of time. 

The session view and arrangement view are completely seperat from one another, and I don't know of any way to link clips. It would be cool to have that option though, like how 'patterns' work in FL Studio.

EDIT: HOLY CRAP! I found this in a different thread here on Reddit which - if you have Ableton 10 Suite (and Max4Live) - will grant us this functionality. The solution is alias clips! https://sonicbloom.net/en/link-midi-clips-to-get-updated-at-once-with-max-for-live-device-alias-clips/"

Self-confidence applies to many different aspects of personality. You may have great self-confidence in socializing, but you may have low self-confidence in performing arts. To clarify, here are some questions: Do I trust myself to be monogamous? Do I trust myself to raise a child? Do I trust myself to lead a conversation about climate change? Do I trust myself to start a new career?

From Wikipedia: ""One's self confidence increases from experiences of having satisfactorily completed particular activities.[1]¬†It is a positive[2]¬†belief that in the future one can generally accomplish what one wishes to do.""

I'm quite adept in Ableton Live and I can see no possibility of this being the result of something I have done. The clip was recorded quite simply with no effects, the only function used being quantization. Actually it might be a problem with quantization? I can't recall if this has been the case in the past.

Sorry for the lack of info, I have troubleshooter quite a bit. I'm on Windows 10! I have run into the same issue on Windows 8 and 7, but NOT on OS X (but I've had limited use in OS X) 

The problem still persists after (1) eliminating all plug-in chains (affecting midi and/or audio), (2) swapping out instruments, (3) duplicating midi clip to a new track, (4) deleting notes and re-recording them in the same clip, (5) importing track and/or midi track to a new project, (6) removing (if any) all automation withing midi clip and (7) unplugging all connected USB devices, including keyboard and mouse and lastly (8) unplugging audio interface and swapping driver to Windows built-in audio.

The screen dump is taken from a project containing only ONE TRACK with no other plug-in active other than Kontakt Retro Machines. Kontakt is not a part of the problem.

This is just a freaking mystery to me. Baffling. It can get very cumbersome and demotivating having to re-record midi clips time and time again. :("

My gf told me recently that nothing makes me light up more as when I receive and test a new digital gadget."
dysthymia,ewhum7w,t3_cf77t0,1565423225.0,"I was stuck in what I believe to be a double depression for about 3 years. I had to move back in to my mom's place for a year, because I fucked everything up in the city I initially moved to (and eventually moved back to). I always downplayed my mood and emotions with others, even my mom. I also masked my depression by being more cheery around others. It was so exhausting. I would always try to be interested and engaged in others, always thinking of what to say when things got quiet. Anyway... I think my mom was confused as to what state I was in. She would tell me to stop wallowing in self pity and stop being lazy. It fucking sucked. But I understood her, and I hold no grudge. She didn't know. She couldn't possibly know how I really felt. I rarely share my true feelings, and it was hard for me at the time to even identify the feelings I was (or wasn't) having... Going to a psychologist soon, hoping to get a diagnosis, in which case I will share with my mom."
depression,ew9c690,t1_ew8bo1q,1565222964.0,I've started a new habit. Every day I wake up I immediately grab a book I have on my night stand and start reading. It helps.
depression,ew9bwwq,t1_ew78ug1,1565222845.0,"I got to that point a few years ago, when suddenly I stopped dreaming at all. It was impossible for me to continue lucid dreaming. Very odd. Started dreaming again a year ago, but not often. I've been able to lucid dream once since then."
depression,ew3lrh8,t1_ew38twf,1565085408.0,"Damn! I started doing this when I was 11 y/o. I kept doing it, and it just got worse with time, and in high school I would just NOT do my homework at all. I didn't pay attention in class either. When there was an upcoming test I would speed study for the test the night before and go to school without sleep. I always passed, somehow. I actually did fairly well, it all came easy to me. I didn't actually learn anything, but I was good at ""cheating""."

depression,ew12jh4,t3_cm8c95,1565013511.0,"I tried two different study programs and just hopped off after a month during the first semesters of both programs. The consequence of that was me being denied student loans in the future, unless I passed previous exams that I didn't even try to study for. I went to see my GP to tell him I was depressed during those years so that he would send a letter to the student bank. I got my loan for my current study program and I get by. Better than ever. Thing is though, I really felt that I was lying to get ahead, cheating the system. I felt like I was just being fucking lazy, pathetic and hopeless for not handling my shit. The shit that everyone else handles so well. I never truly realized the severity of my depression and how it was royally fucking up my life. I only just realized that a couple of days ago, at the age og 27, soon to turn 28. 

It feels awful. Worse now than ever, because now I know had I only identified the true culprit I could've took action and see a psychologist for evaluation and avoid wasting so many years of  my early adulthood. Fuck.

I also lie a lot about other things. Especially about the way I feel, in any given context. I thought I was just a compulsive liar, as I've been lying since I was 5 years old. It turns out though that I think I've only protected others from the pain of seeing me suffer. And also protecting myself, because I feel so strongly (hypersensitivity) and I shut down or lash out when I feel judged or misunderstood. I can say very hurtful things to the people close to me. My strategy since early adolescence has been to channel that sadness and frustration into my music. Which helps, up to a certain point."
