This is what happened I went to go see my psychologist for the first time. when I came to the appointment it turned out that he went out sick and I had two appointments to see him and a psychiatrist so I ended up just talking to the psychiatrist and she determined that I had a personality disorder and decided to give me medication but I wasn't trying to take it just because I'm not into it hard drugs. especially for the first time meeting a therapist or a professional I don't like that they push the drug on me just to feel better.

Is pretty much to have a low-carb/ clean keto diet. You can let your endocrinologist know because it is important to let a professional know how you're feeling but just saying they usually won't do much for the issue just because it's a very underlying issue that they can't even solve. if you're really feeling anxious and you need something to help relieve the anxiety and even help relieve autoimmune conditions I suggest trying a low cannabis strain or CBD it is known to help with relaxation. I tried the same things you tried and I didn't really feel that great until I smoke cannabis and read up cannabis and auto immune conditions. I can link the video if you like.
Hypothyroidism,fiy8obu,t3_fa7bkv,1582834707.0,"Cannabis for autoimmune disorders :

I came to this conclusion based off of the comment section, based off of my own knowledge/experiences and based off of debates. Cannabis is not entirely to blame for anxiety . I believe, It's the man made high amounts of THC that is the underlying issue. You might ask "" what do you mean man made?"" Well growers engineer higher amounts of THC into cannabis now so you can get higher and they also lower the amount of CBD during the process. 

And that right there can be an issue for most people specially to new consumers. CBD and THC co-exist from one another to help make you relax and enjoy the high. If one of the two chemicals are out of balance, your most likely going to have an uncomfortable experience. Either one giving you a certain high that you love but giving you anxiety during the session or another that relaxes you, but not give you the high that you want. 

It's a pretty technical thing just because it requires more balancing with things compared to alcohol. so everybody pretty much varies with consuming cannabis and that's why there's a lot of misconceptions with it. If you give a man who never dranked before a can of beer. He would probably be buzzed out . But if you give him a bottle of vodka and tell him to finish it . He would be vomitting, sweating, have mood swings and probably regret ever taking the bottle to begin with. That same scenario can be applied to cannabis aswell.

 If random people are consuming random amount of THC, then that in itself can be dangerous. It ruins your mental state by giving you high amounts of anxiety or psychosis. Know what your taking , start low with THC and do not go overboard with it. If you still feel uncomfortable with the lowest amount of natural unfucked with cannabis, then it's time to try CBD oil/flower , it has the lowest amount of THC. In fact I say start out with that first if your curious about cannabis. Be responsible in what you consume and you should be A okay! I believe drugs like this are not the issue, its the lack of knowledge that the school system/ public needs to update on and know. Consume responsibly and be safe üëç"

And since cannabis now and days is more potent with higher amounts of THC I can see why that's an issue for people. Since it's known to increase anxiety and psychosis."
weedbiz,fiy43hb,t1_fiy3xar,1582832112.0,What's that?
eldertrees,fiy1mwp,t3_fadcyn,1582830714.0,"I came to this conclusion based off of the comment section, based off of my own knowledge/experiences and based off debates. Cannabis is not the issue believe it or not it . I believe, It's the man made high amount of THC that is the issue. If you give a man who never dranked before a can of beer. He would probably be buzzed out . But if you give him a bottle of vodka and tell him to finish it . He would be vomitting, sweating, have mood swings and probably regret ever taking the bottle of vodka to begin with. That same scenario can be applied towards cannabis. If random people are consuming random amount of THC, then that in itself can be dangerous. It ruins your mental state by giving you high amounts of anxiety or psychosis. Know what your taking , start low with THC and do not over consuming it. And if you still feel uncomfortable with the lowest amount then it's time to try CBD oil/flower , it has the lowest amount of THC. In fact I say start out with that first if your curious about cannabis. Be responsible in what you consume and you should be fine.I believe drugs like this are not the issue, its the lack of knowledge that the school system/ public needs to update on and know."

Hypothyroidism,fiprtvr,t3_f963bj,1582618259.0,For Diet what are you eating and what are your consuming ?
trees,fioy7va,t3_f8qat8,1582593777.0,Okay people can be a tad over the top with weed lol.
Hypothyroidism,fiorsy9,t1_finzr88,1582589490.0,what is your diet like ?? No offense but sounds like your overweight and no matter if you have a thyriod disorder or not being overweight makes everything worse. I would handle that problem first by going on a low carb diet and also IBS and stress makes auto immune diseases worse if you have one .
