schizophrenia,fl4dopb,t1_fl3gn07,1584811338.0,Indeed god is a narcissistic sadistic man who made an entire cosmos to worship him and if it didn’t then we eternally burn. I have a very hard opinion on this and agree with you.
schizophrenia,fl4d7it,t3_fmb853,1584811056.0,"Mine started fairly young it was when I was about nine when it started and I’ve only gotten my diagnosis recently and I’m 15 now. I’d have to say my first episode was when I fell asleep in my grandmothers living room and when I woke up the paintings and pictures on the wall started moving and talking screaming things at me telling me how awful I am. I would see reapers frequently on the side of roads just starting at me and I never said anything because I just figured it was my imagination in a sense. I was very disorganized and just rhymed random words with no correlating meanings all the time (still do) I could manage though. Recently however my hearing has been really bad I keep hearing people say my name when no ones near by or home, I also hear scrapping and screaming a lot. When I lived with my father for I year I used to hear a foghorn and sirens a lot and then see a man with a black coat on it happened a lot at school and I got silent and distant from the rest after about 2 weeks my teachers got concerned and pulled me aside and asked what was wrong I told them nothing but they asked again so I told them I saw things and heard things that weren’t there and then I pleaded to them to not tell my dad but they had to. I was given a pink paper that my dad had to sign if I wanted help and he signed it but I didn’t want help I didn’t want to believe there were things that I sensed that no one else did. About a year ago I started seeing “monstrosity’s” from my dreams like demonic looking things, and it started to overwhelm me and I got close to taking my life. During a time when I was contemplating ending my life I was in an Xbox party with a kid from school and just started crying out of no where (and it’s hard for me to cry I’ve always just had trouble doing so, like if a family member died I’d just feel eh and move on with my life) and they asked what was wrong and stayed with me, that helped me realize that some people care about me even If I don’t care about myself. Then I decided I wanted to see someone about it which would be hard for me to ask because I don’t really talk about it to anyone I just push it down and say it’s all in my head, I’m normal, also my grandmother who I live with is religious (she’s a pastor) and I was concerned she was going to use this a religious point and say I’m seeing demons or it’s the enemy (I’m not religious, she thinks I am). Either way I knew I had to ask her and I did so about 3 months ago I was diagnosed and yeah story so far."
schizophrenia,fl4b22x,t3_fm9k1r,1584809772.0,That’s funny In a way; I have this brown hat that I always wear like everywhere it’s got bleach spots and a lot of pins on it. Whenever I wear it though it comforts me a little bit.

ElderScrolls,fh9kasz,t3_f1qdrr,1581383300.0,"Just gonna say the only reason to side with the imperials is to save Skyrim from the elven invasion. However if you side with the Stormcloaks you rightfully liberate Skyrim from imperial scum although it will taken by the elves, but if you don’t kill pathroux then you can possibly have the dragons side with the Stormcloaks since you’ve freed them. Point is Stormcloaks teamed with graybeards ultimately teamed with dragons is superb."
