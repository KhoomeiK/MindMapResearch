My girl just turned 2 and had a cleft lip, no palate. When we first found out I'm sure like anyone else we were terrified and shocked. 

I told some of my immediate family about it, they were really supportive and that gave me the courage to slowly start telling other family members and friends, honestly all I got was support, and as the comment above me suggests, one of my mums friends said that his son had a cleft lip. I was like what?! I had no idea. 

The scariest part is the unknown, so for you, now. Google didn't help me and stressed me out more.  When your baby comes out you just deal with it, like anything else. It's seems like a massive thing now, but honestly (from my experience and how I felt) you just get on with it and it takes you about a week not to even notice it. 

You won't believe a word of this but he will probably have his operation around 4 months old, when he does, you will miss it. No one prepared me for this but I became really upset, I actually missed her cleft and felt it changed her. It didn't. She was obviously just groggy and sore from the operation. She soon returned back to normal but I think it took me longer to get over them repairing her cleft than first learning about it!
