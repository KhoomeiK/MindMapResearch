Maybe add 666,- for Ungdomskort too but yeah. With no luxuries 1500 DKK for food is quite enough. 100 DKK for Lebara's packet with 100GB internet."
learndota2,fqul6rz,t1_fq6clst,1589660687.0,"How can your MMR be so low lol? I remember when I had 900 MMR when I first started. Then I bought a seasonal ticket that made it possible for you to re-calibrate, then it calibrated me at 2.9k (from 900)."
DotA2,fpnm9tt,t1_fp0ym6t,1588767262.0,"First off, I had a few bunch of female teammates in DotA before. I treat them no different than others. I acknowledge their strategical assessments since they are the same MMR as me, I acknowledge they should be as good as me, but when I flame, I flame them too.

Secondly, I am pretty sure that it's not only about the guys' fault. The number of girls that revealed themselves playing games are infinitely small compared to the whole gaming community. Trust me, I saw maybe 50x times more men pretending to be a female than being a real female. Most of the times, trolls being troll. In most cases, ""send me tit. pics"" is another way of saying ""I don't believe that you are a girl, if you were a girl, you would be able to send me tit pics"". I am not arguing how ethical, it is, or how appropriate. But especially in MMORPGs it was a solid scam that scammer men trying to seduce other men in disguise of being a woman/girl using other female people's pictures from the internet & voice changers. Also, I am pretty sure at least 80% of all DotA players have played MMORPGs before so they are familiar with this, ""culture"".

So, whenever someone claims to be a girl in a game, unfortunately, they are extremely more likely to be a man instead of being a girl. Even they finally believe that you are a girl, their minds still reject that you can be a normal girl so they assume other things - which is ridiculous.So what is the problem here? (I don't include the social & cultural ridicules that has huge impact on this case, let's just assume that they are already there so what can we do more to lessen the effects)

1. The most fundamental problem is, girls need to play more games. I know it sounds ridiculous, but trust me, very high portion of gamers (if not all) assume that the people they are playing with are all males. Because of all the reasons I've discussed so far.
2. Girls need not to blend as males in the game community, instead they need to contrast that they are not male. And they unfortunately should ignore any harassment they are being imposed.
3. Girls may need to form some sort of activities in the particular game - such as tournaments (girls-only) - and say - stream it on Twitch.

In conclusion, you need to make the community accept that there are actually girls playing the game and that is completely okay."

However, after watching the videos that has been shared above, I started to check if there are any TPRS courses in Danish in Denmark. I cannot find any so far, but this comment includes one of the best alternatives I suppose. Mange tak!"
