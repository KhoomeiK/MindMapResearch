AskReddit,fd0xpkk,t3_ejr5rg,1578125185.0,"I can pin point my mental health deteriorating as far back as 6 years old. I was being repeatedly sexually assaulted at school by another child, had a parent in and out of hospital with cancer and very little family and friends around. I wasn’t the most ‘normal’ kid but I remember I was kind and had good intentions. I rarely acted out, (well not until I hit adolescence anyway) I just used to say odd things now and again because my life at the time wasn’t your average 6 year olds life. From aged 10 I was bullied and often isolated all the way through secondary school and it even spilled in to university. I couldn’t problem solve, I didn’t understand my emotions and at a time I struggled with any interaction people were turning away from me. I had to learn all these things as an adult.

If there was one thing I noticed, it was that adults weren’t kind to me. So many people saw I needed help and ignored me. Teachers, parents friends, my own friends. I built this view of the world that everything was my fault. I deserved it because I wasn’t “good enough” and that I was the problem. Luckily when I was 19 I met a really amazing group of friends and if it wasn’t for them my life would have gone a very different way. They were kind, supportive, made me laugh and 13 years later we’re all still really close, we’re bridesmaids at each other’s weddings and a lot of us happened to have kids at the same time. I also made a career for myself by pursuing a job as a therapist. I want to help stop others from feeling the way I felt growing up and in my early adulthood.

I often wonder why so many people wrote me off as a child an adolescent but in all honestly it doesn’t matter now. I came so close to lighting the match but didn’t."
relationship_advice,fcysmt4,t3_ejgink,1578086208.0,"It’s more likely that you’re 18 than 4ft 7. Dating is a completely different ball game at 18 to later into your 20’s and onwards. I’m aiming for this to sound reassuring rather than patronising so sorry if this goes the other way. A lot but not all people at 18 need to learn a bit more about how to be in a relationship (not just romantic, friendship too) and generally just live their life a bit. School is often a toxic place where we’ve learned to survive rather than relate and it takes a while to get out of that way of thinking. Adult life is new, work is new, everything’s terrifying and the majority of people if not most people are secretly a little bit scared of failure. No-one knows what’s going to happen over the next few years of their life, who they might date, where they might live, if the job they want will happen. Being a bit short never stopped a lot of people so maybe push aside any comment about never getting married, no-one knows what’s going to happen and being a bit short shouldn’t hold you back, including being in a relationship."

AmItheAsshole,fatt1kr,t3_ea4hnu,1576341361.0,NTA I work in mental health in the UK and treatment for phobias is widely available. Most local mental health services will offer CBT based therapy and graded exposure which is shown to be highly effective. Good luck to you both and hope you get through it together.
Anxiety,eybwqtq,t3_cq2yu2,1566993093.0,"This is the first time I’ve been on this subreddit and hearing so many people say things that I’ve done for years is partly a relief. So in answer to your question, yes 100% with texts and emails too,"
depression,ewpp4xs,t1_ewpkvkg,1565646101.0,"Ah okay, not what I thought it was, that sounds pretty awful to be honest. I feel for you living with that. No idea what you can do or whether similar strategies would work, have you run it by a doctor or other medical professional?"
depression,ewpkgn7,t3_cpi3dp,1565643119.0,"I don’t know to be honest, what do you mean by brain fog? I get concentration issues, I find I have to use the “stop” technique (initially recognising it) and then some form of mindfulness exercise to focus me back. The worst is when I don’t recognise it and ruminate."
depression,ewmoofp,t3_cp1iaf,1565556745.0,"A lot of what you’re saying I’ve felt as well. I have two kids, a chaotic background and I seem to be dipping up and down into a depression. The monotony of the days, especially how you describe having just an hour in the evening is something that gets to me too. I’ve felt guilty beyond belief for bringing children into the world when I feel like this sometimes but I know that I’m their world, whatever level of parenting I’m on that day. Parenting isn’t easy for someone at the best of times let alone when you have to constantly battle with your head as well. It’s also so much more common that you might think, children are both amazing and a huge source of stress. Your life goes from having free time and thinking about a few people to you sacrificing so much of your life for someone else. I think the Dads often get a rubbish deal because they go to bottom of the pile. Keep talking, to people who might understand, to those close to you, on here on Reddit. Know that however flat and rubbish you feel you are a good parent and also know that you and your health are so so important too. Hope that helps even a tiny bit."
CasualConversation,etqifa4,t3_ccsuxb,1563086398.0,"My husband and I rarely wear ours either, he’s an electrician so I’d rather he didn’t wear his at work for safety reasons. We meant to get him a silicon one but never got round to it. I’m a therapist who works in a hospital, they don’t allow stoned rings for infection control reasons. We came to the same conclusion, we know we’re married and that’s all that matters. We both know from conversation that if we’re out separately and happen to get hit on (rare for both of us) it’s a nice compliment but both of us happen to drop into conversation how much we love each other and our kids. It’s nice to hear someone else who doesn’t wear a ring either as it just isn’t the norm these days."

pregnant,epx4i2a,t3_bwamsi,1559591826.0,"I was told about something called hypnobirthing when I was pregnant, at first I thought it was just a bit of a hippie thing but it really wasn’t it just talks about birth in a really positive and practical way that makes you feel you can do it. There are lots of people, courses, books that you can find but the best one that I found was the positive birth company by Siobhan Miller (she has free videos on YouTube). It really helped in preparation and during my twin birth. It’s 100% normal to be scared, normal to panic and normal to cry just know you’re stronger than you realise and you’ve got this mama ❤️"
