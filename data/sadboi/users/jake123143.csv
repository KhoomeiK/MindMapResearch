depression,ermhz6y,t1_ermhnfw,1561023727.0,I still think about all the times I'd rather be alone with my thoughts than with them. That's a pain I want you to be able to avoid. I'm sorry for rambling and spamming but I just dont want you to make the mistakes I did. No one deserves that pain.
depression,ermhtmd,t1_ermhnfw,1561023478.0,"I didnt mean that you didnt love them, so I'm sorry that's how I came across. I know its difficult to cry when you cant allow yourself to do it around them. All I know is that when the day comes you can never see or hold them again, you'll wish you never had to be alone to cry again. I still dream about seeing my father after he killed himself. I remember his body and when I see him sitting on the couch I just break down sobbing and begging. Asking him not to leave me. Just dont make yourself feel so separate with your pain. Be open with them. They love you."
depression,ermcwax,t3_c2fuf3,1561015873.0,"You think that's true but frankly, it's not. Try having to cry and needing someone to hold you and waking up to realize they're dead. Why dont you just love them while you have them. Do you know how painful it is to know that your parents rather die than love you? And then to want to cry but remember you dont have anywhere to go. I dont want to sound like a dick but just be happy for what you have. I love every little bit of what's left. Even if I'm all alone now."
