KUWTK,fmh5p3e,t3_fv3ecv,1586067591.0,"He's a genius because he took risks that influenced a generation and multiple industries. 

He is one of the biggest influences and forerunners of modern hip hop. There were two main groups of hip-hop: ones talking about gangs, girls, and money and ones that were more political and about social justice (the former was more main stream). When Kanye entered the scene, he paved a third avenue. He wasn't part of gang culture, he wasn't talking about all his bling,  but he wasn't rapping about a revolution either. He talked about family, his religion, his personal battles, him dropping out of college. His brand was very personal and told a story, which was very unconventional back then. In large part because of kanye, we got JuiceWrld rapping about missing his ex, we have Drake who borders between pop and hip hop, and many more rappers that didn't grow up in the stereotypical gang communities. (He mentored Travis Scott, Kid Cudi, Big Sean, etc.)

Also, his producing skills are amazing. He brought soul sampling back into mainstream rap and gave rap music more dimensions with layered vocals, samples, etc. He popularized chipmunk soul, which is the high pitched soul voice that's found in many songs today. He gave rap music more body and melody. 

He's also very versatile. His albums are very distinct from each other. College dropout was his debut album and it gave off a ""regular person"" vibe (which, again, was very different than rap at that time). But then you have an album like Graduation, which was meant to be for partying at clubs. But you also have Yeezus, a EDM hip hop collab. More recently, he put out Ye, which is more somber and about his mental health. And most recently, he put out Jesus is King, a gospel album. 

Moreover, he has definitely made his mark in the fashion industry. Many people mocked his clothing line because it looked ""so basic and homeless"". But people describe outfits and color tones as ""kanye-esque"" which shows that his designs are unique enough to have a distinct style. He also made a big splash in the men's shoe fashion world too with his Yeezys.
