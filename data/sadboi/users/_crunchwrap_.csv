glee,fr12w3l,t3_glvydh,1589812197.0,I don’t see it like this at all. Brittany was trying to be supportive because she saw that Santana was struggling. All she wanted to do was to help Santana come to terms with who she was. She wanted to help her become comfortable. I didn’t realize that being encouraging or supportive meant that you were being forceful.
glee,fqymv7u,t1_fqylp3z,1589751170.0,People do call out the other characters not as much maybe but they do call them out. I know I do. I bring up Blaine specifically because I LOVED Klaine in the beginning and then that happened and it became a shit show from there. Also characters that have not cheated from the top of my head are Jesse and Artie. Artie got cheated on by Brittany.
glee,fqy2udz,t3_glkwi9,1589741688.0,Blaine cheating on Kurt. Hands down. I can’t justify it.
glee,fqtqy2p,t3_gkvshe,1589644374.0,I don't think she was turned on by Puck. Nor was she turned on by the Spanish teacher. Just because you're gay doesn't mean that you're blind. You can still find people aesthetically attractive. Santana probably used Puck in a way because she was lonely. I'm asexual but I can still tell if people are ugly or not. I'm just not sexually attracted to them.
glee,fqbngtb,t3_ghwwni,1589240301.0,Hello! Songs that Glee should have done is currently a locked topic as it is discussed quite a bit on our subreddit. Please feel free to use the search bar to find other answers. :)
glee,fqa3bs8,t3_ghpt3a,1589212073.0,No
aromantic,fqa10xy,t3_ghmdp4,1589210870.0,I’ve honestly been wondering the same. I’ve kind of given up on the idea all together even though it is something I eventually would like to find if I ever stumble into it. I probably make it harder on myself with the fact that I want it with specific genders.
glee,fq7qzzb,t3_ghb7db,1589150436.0,Interesting you have both Santana and Finn in the God tier when Finn outed Santana before she was ready to come out
birthcontrol,fq6glah,t1_fq6g6z4,1589131119.0,"You’re not alone! I have questioned whether my birth control made me asexual. There was one point in my life where I remember having a libido but I can’t pin point exactly when it went away. I’ve honestly always been confused what sexual attraction actually is. Same with romantic attraction. I’m also aromantic. Either or, regardless of why you’re ace you’re still ace if you feel comfortable identifying that way!"
birthcontrol,fq6ezww,t3_ggyxqu,1589130240.0,I just want to say I’m glad you feel comfortable discussing this here! I’m asexual and on birth control. I wouldn’t say my birth control is the reason for this though. I never really had a strong interest in sex before and whenever I did have sex it was because I thought it was what you were just supposed to do. I looked at sex as more of an experiment. I always found it awkward and uncomfortable. But some things to remember are that libido and sexual attraction are different. I have a low libido but that’s not why I’m asexual. I’m asexual cause I’m not sexually attracted to anyone.
glee,fq40gfm,t3_ggrlf0,1589072344.0,"I don’t think he didn’t think bisexuality existed or was any less legitimate. Even though he quite literally claims that. I think he was just frustrated and scared to loose Blaine so he took it out on the whole idea of bisexuality. I’m not saying the way he handled it was right, but I don’t think Kurt was inherently trying to be an exclusionist."

glee,fpx19fr,t3_gg23kv,1588973760.0,I have never seen Will Schuester in a top tier. I disagree with the majority of this. I thought my tier list was different but this kind of tops it.
aromantic,fprp90o,t3_gf54cd,1588859323.0,“I want to want that.” I felt that.
glee,fpq7vq2,t3_gexcuf,1588816943.0,Neither of them are. Bipolar is a serious mental health disorder. And it’s not just going up and down all the time. If you are referring to Maddison she had attachment issues with her brother. Kitty was just a bitch at times and she had self hatred issues and took it out on other people. She became a better person because she evolved like most people do when they realize they are wrong. None of them were bipolar.

glee,fpgi64o,t3_gdcnzf,1588603190.0,My two favorite things in the world. Glee and The Office.
glee,fpev182,t3_gd24ny,1588555544.0,The fact that the episode was named Shooting Star should tell you everything you need to know about how problematic that episode was. Killing off Brittany would just be the icing on the cake.

glee,foyvpny,t3_gaawx4,1588180052.0,Glee would not be as good in 2020 as it was in 2009. They wouldn’t get away with half of the jokes on the show. I honestly think it wouldn’t be as enjoyable. I’m glad it aired when it did.
glee,foyh3au,t1_foyd3xw,1588172406.0,"Thank you! You explained this perfectly. I wanted to come in defense, but I wasn’t sure how to word it. As an alcoholic myself who is now clean, we don’t choose to be addicts. It happens. Suffering from addiction isn’t problematic. More so what we choose to do with that addiction is."
glee,foy6gvb,t3_ga7xch,1588166401.0,"Ryder was one of those people who wanted so badly to be the good guy but he just ended up being bad. As simple as I can put it. He kind of tried to guilt Marley into being with him because he is a “good guy”. Once you start playing that card one too many times, you start to become unlikable as a character imo. If they had just stuck with his dyslexic storyline, I would have honestly preferred that. Instead they made him too complex. Which is something he originally wasn’t supposed to be. Don’t even get me started on the Unique + Ryder situation."
glee,foy60jh,t3_ga2r4r,1588166112.0,I can def talk to some of the other admins about setting this up! I think this would be fun.

glee,fortlwx,t3_g9392c,1588018291.0,I ended up going back and watching some Youtube videos of it and I can't believe I didn't realize how cringy it was at the time lmao.
glee,fortg13,t3_g96go3,1588018209.0,I stopped watching during the second half of s4 but then I made myself watch the rest during a rewatch because I wanted to see what happened. I don't regret going back and rewatching all of it. I just regret watching Puppet Master.
glee,forszzw,t3_g96n04,1588017988.0,This is a really binary poll. I don't fit either of those categories. I watch the show and I'm nonbinary. I'm also queer.

glee,fond6od,t3_g8eu34,1587917210.0,"I said no but I also think it would depend on what cast members would be comfortable doing it. I watched the recent mini reunion and I’m not gonna lie, some of the cast members on there looked kind of awkward and out of place. Darren expressed that a lot of the cast were overworked to the point of exhaustion. I would only want those who truly would want to do it to attend."
vcu,folevvg,t3_g7nr6i,1587860740.0,Allison Ryalls! I’ve taken several of her classes. She truly has her students best interests at heart. She’s super understanding and is passionate about what she teaches. I also really love Misty Lewis. I took her class at 9AM and she was like a fresh cup of coffee every time. She didn’t make me dread going to class and she’s also really passionate about what she teaches. They’re both social work professors.
glee,fol6iq5,t3_g82x20,1587855848.0,I wouldn’t have had Klaine get married. Especially not have a baby. I would have loved to just have seen Santana and Brittany get married without Kurt or Blaine. They deserved their own wedding. Other than that I have no complaints. I got my endgame which was St. Berry.
glee,fol3crw,t3_g82llt,1587854075.0,None of those characters have the range for that song imo. They’d have to completely remaster it. I think Brittany would do good with it.
glee,fol3447,t3_g8087l,1587853940.0,I really love what Glee did with Becky and how they gave her an abled boyfriend. I complain a lot about Glee but the writers usually weren’t abelists and I really do admire that.

glee,foe4fov,t1_foe1jeb,1587695819.0,I *was* a really big fan of Klaine so that’s why I can’t look past Blaine’s cheating. I wasn’t a fan of Finchel which is probably why I can look past Rachel’s cheating. Neither were right. But I love Rachel as a character as well despite all of her flaws and that’s also why she is in top tier.
glee,fodu1ad,t1_fodtsaf,1587690114.0,Poor character development. Not to mention I can’t look past his cheating. Also shit just got mad weird.
glee,fods2je,t1_fodrwqx,1587689069.0,"Brad the piano guy was iconic imo. Jesse has always been a high favorite of mine because of St. Berry and just his over all growth.

glee,fnsxibe,t1_fnsxbxp,1587230675.0,But we did to some degree. Her and Sam bonded over it. Because he went through something similar. We didn’t get much but it was something other than her mother being interesting.
glee,fnswuc6,t1_fnswn55,1587230312.0,I disagree about being poor not making her interesting. In the beginning it showed her mother having to make her daughters clothes and then struggling to pay for Marley to go to therapy in the later episodes of s4. Which I thought was interesting and that they could have expanded on that but didn’t. I do agree with some of your points though.
glee,fnsrvkm,t3_g3qazl,1587227617.0,I honestly wouldn’t want to apply. Imagine being around a tone of Rachel’s all the time? A true nightmare. Love her but no.
glee,fnsdg4u,t3_g3o0to,1587219207.0,It’s also Glee. It’s not supposed to make sense a lot of the time. Sue and Will’s feud was one of those moments. There were times they didn’t feud btw and were actually adults.

glee,fnidkb4,t1_fnicw3r,1586978186.0,"You’re kidding right? Santana may never have sent someone to the hospital, but she has definitely harmed people.

glee,fni9gv6,t3_g1xxko,1586976237.0,"At least Sebastian actually changed his ways after being a bully and tried to make things right. After Santana came out, she had time to change but she didn’t.

This will be my first time trying it. And I'm not sure if all Netflix's around the world have Glee. However, we do have an option where you don't have to use Netflix and can use another method if need be.

Edit: I think you can actually turn subtitles on your own screen! You’d have to test it out though to make sure."

glee,fn43l2c,t1_fn438eh,1586633358.0,I never said that they put pressure on her just that she felt pressured due to insecurities. She felt like she couldn’t be herself around them and that she felt as if she was never good enough. Finn always had his eyes on Rachel subconsciously and Schue rarely gave her any solos for the exception of season 2 and a couple of others for assignments.
glee,fn3i47w,t3_fz7tpp,1586621198.0,"Quinn is a very complex character and a lot of people don’t realize and understand this. All they see is her surface level. The bitch facade. But she was so much more than just a bitch. She was probably one of the few characters that had a lot of depth. She felt all of this pressure to be someone else and felt as if she couldn’t be herself because in her eyes she would never be good enough because so many people would constantly bring her down. Example: her parents, Sue, Finn, and Mr. Schue. They all had good moments with her but not enough. Quinn is under valued and under appreciated. Most people don’t like her and it’s not an unpopular opinion."

glee,fmy4xkh,t3_fy2tm4,1586478205.0,I’m not a huge early seasons Brittana fan but I think Klaine was way more toxic. However I understand why people would think Brittana is more toxic. My main reasonings are of the earlier seasons when Santana manipulates Brittany into being with her and cheating with her when she was in a relationship with Artie. Santana could have gotten Brittany on her own but she didn’t have that much confidence as she let on.  Otherwise she would have let things happen organically.
