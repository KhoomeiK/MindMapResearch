I want to give you a slew of encouraging words, but losing your mom is a whole moment/super gut wrenching personal experience in its self that I fear to identify with at any time. I know I wouldn’t be able to process anyone trying to process or dissect my feelings with me at this time.  That being said, I know eventually your heart will heal & the hurting will eventually have stopped on its own. Feel all the feels. It’s your feelings to feel and that’s okay."

Somebody, ANYBODY make it make sense, cus whhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaa🤔🤦🏾‍♀️."
offmychest,fq7c82c,t3_ggyimh,1589144510.0,"Good for u bro! Fuk those dudes. They were obvs NEVER your friends. Better to hold out for the real ones and be a loner for awhile. Good people that don’t do shitty things like this  DO exist. I know right, crazy given the stats. Get to know yourself and drop the dead weights. Proud of you for sticking up for yourself💪🏾."
relationship_advice,fq7ahgu,t3_gd02cr,1589143874.0,"Chyyyeah, not cool. Not sure if he’s had childhood trauma or if he’s used to enclosed masculinity from learned behavior, but it’s unfortunate that he can’t just enjoy that your son’s just freely being a kid. It’s obvs this accusatory behavior is getting under your skin, and I can only assume that’s not good at all for a wife and husband relationship let alone a healthy family home dynamic. Maybe counseling will allow both of your to express your feelings and delve deeper into what’s really going on. Discussing this in a professional safe space with no judgements is better than stewing on something like this. Good luck, and I bet your son is absolutely a darling individual💓."
relationship_advice,fq786mx,t3_gds6m7,1589143031.0,"Naaaaaaaah. He’s a fukn creep. Everything he’s saying and doing is BEYOND inappropriate. It might be uncomfortable to tell your bf, but fuck it TELL HIM. I also know u mentioned you’re timid, but this dude keeps on persistently harassing you ...draaaag his ass verbally, hold him accountable for making you feel gross, but please before doing so have someone (a safety net better yet your bf) waiting in the sidelines for you to leave or call on if it gets out of control-his reaction that is. Regardless you need to GTF outta there. Once again tell your boyfriend IMMEDS."

selfharm,fq0ryde,t3_gg1tzg,1589036836.0,"It’s hard not to give a shit. I tots get it, but I read something somewhere (wish I remembered), but basically it said people like yourself and I shouldn’t shame themselves for their battle wounds. It’s apart of your story, and it has become something that’s apart of you/your story of survival. I understand people can be truly fucking insensitive (god I hate people so much-like legit fukn hate it here!!!!), but keep your head held high AF, bcus ppl like that are BASIC, unable to comprehend the idea of social respect, and don’t at all deserve a little bit of you. So don’t even give em that. Anytime you feel some type of way just always remind yourself of the saying: “Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.” Fukn losers."
CasualConversation,fq0q7r7,t3_ggfl6b,1589035924.0,"..srsly supr hard to stop these habits/repetitive addictive behaviors. Trust, I know. Weirdly, we sound like the same person, minus the fact that you had the mental capacity to just up and quit everything cold turkey while remaining consistent with no slip ups for such a period of time. Personally doing these self destructive things def make me feel good in regards to my dissociation and dissatisfaction with my current life in comparison to my past life(as a creative-dancer/writer/blah blah etc). So it’s hard AF to just stop. I know it’s OD to commence forth w/ how I’ve been commencing forth, but reading something like this actually gives me a sprinkle of hope that it’s possible to get back on track. Good luck with everything and congrats on getting back to the normality that is You."
