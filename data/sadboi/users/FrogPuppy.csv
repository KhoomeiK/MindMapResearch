aspergers,fp8ohfj,t3_gbzmsx,1588397974.0,"I was having basically intense panic attacks whenever I am near people in highschool, and frankly before then. But, it drove me to suicide attempts and depression, so I started searching online for mental health disorders and such that would coincide with my symptoms. Fast forward about 15 years and I finally found a winner.

Sadly, getting diagnosed is not an option, since medi-cal doesn't want me to have one or doesn't believe me because when I asked for a therapist to diagnose me, they referred me to a family therapist. I asked if she had expertise and experience handling autism/aspergers, and if she could diagnose me. She told me no to both.

Worst part of all this is my family is abusive, and none of them want to admit the abuse, nor the fact that they are autistic/aspies. How do I know they have aspergers? Because every single one of them does one of the symptoms-one way social interaction, where they tell me about shit I never asked about, nor was it even a topic in the conversation, and they go on and on and on about it regardless of whether I show interest or not. They all have a special interest as well. I know myself, that I have almost no clue on social interactions and cues. It's like telling me to reverse engineer a space rocket.

The main thing I have struggled with is the social anxiety. It's so intense that it makes me become frozen, both mentally and physically. It's like moving and thinking through molasses. I think it comes from a long history of abuse and learning to fear people because they keep hurting me."

Honestly, I'm just trying to take better care of myself, put myself first instead of others. Do things I want to do, not what others want me to.
