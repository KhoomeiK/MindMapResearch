secretsanta,fqzgevr,t1_fqz49od,1589766826.0,I actually just tried the parchment paper method today but found that it collapsed the sides of the boule during transfer so I'm probably just going to go back to placing it in the dutch oven while attempting not to burn my fingers. I like how easy the tranfer is though so I wonder if I can find a workaround somehow.

ynab,fj0jx80,t3_fasxvb,1582901687.0,"At the end of the month I find it beneficial to think of the budget in terms of weeks vs for the month. When I use the last check I put 1/3 to half of my ""non-negotiable""(food, gas,household etc) into the current month so I'll have something to finish out the month. That way I can use a little and then have something to rollover to bump up the next month. If you find that you have to take from the next month expenses than it's just a matter of rolling with the punches and reprioritizing or finding some additional income to help ease the way,"
