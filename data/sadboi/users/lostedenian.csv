dcuonline,fb8py0n,t3_ebv7jr,1576619199.0,I started playing In July of 2017 I currently have 374 sp there are tons of feats to get sadly most are tied to collections briefings investigations and group content. Just make sure you have an active membership to do certain episodes. Play legends a d get your iconic legends for the lpve events With that said try to find a feat hunting group. I try to find some groups myself.
