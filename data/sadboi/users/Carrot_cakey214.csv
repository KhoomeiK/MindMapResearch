AnorexiaRecovery,fr2bzp3,t3_gm97do,1589834680.0,"Sometimes I'll be eating what seems like a rather large meal, but I have to remind myself that what is large to me, is normal to most people. Food is nutrition, and not something we should be avoiding. 

Idk if you're working or not, but you NEED food to function. You need food to have energy. You need food to stave off the lightheadedness, the dizziness, the weakness. You can never restrict in a way that is beneficial to you, at least as an anorexic."
Lolita,fqbihf7,t3_gheu37,1589237604.0,"Even though I can imagine it being super difficult to find a chiffon blouse similar to the burnt orangey colors of the fish, I feel like it could be achievable if you died an ivory chiffon blouse!"
Lolita,fpaihra,t1_fpae9bj,1588448866.0,"Ahhh yeah. Finding what I'm passionate about has been so difficult given that I have so many little interests that I find worth pursuing. I hope you don't mind me asking, but whatever it is that you found, did it make you happy? Did it prove to be financially feasible? If it wasn't, did it take time to be happy with that job?"
Lolita,fp5qiss,t1_fp5ekyo,1588337507.0,Thanks for being so real with me. I really needed that wake up call! I appreciate your advice and definitely am starting to get a better idea of what I should do now. Thank you!
Lolita,fp3kxli,t1_fp3kjhg,1588281121.0,"Wow, thank you for such a thorough and thoughtful response! You're right. As much as I love lolita, I have lots of other interests I can pursue as well! Those are things I should definitely consider."

To the OP, I would definitely have a talk with management. As a student, you honestly shouldn't even be closing. That shit takes away from your schoolwork, big time."

AnorexiaRecovery,fh6v8l5,t3_f1gxof,1581306957.0,"I've been going through a lot recently too and it's been tough trying to cope with everything. I just have to keep reminding myself that food is the only thing I have that will nourish my body physically. Whatever I have to do, I can't think and be hungry at the same time. The eating disorder will only inhibit me from getting to where I want to be, and I know that it's a much smaller fragment of myself than I used to let it be. You can overcome whatever it is you're dealing with. You CAN. You must be strong for yourself. Anorexia is not who you are, it's an obstacle you have to overcome."

Also, the nerve she has to announce incentives for the ""fastest delivery drivers"" of the month when she's wasting precious minutes of our time dispatching us 3-5 minutes before our food is even out. I've even witnessed her dispatching a driver 7 minutes early, which is LUDICROUS. I had no idea why she was doing it but now that I know Im just super frustrated."

Dominos,ezg48ik,t3_czezjr,1567891039.0,"I was the queen of mistakes when I first started, ohhhhh man. My very first run, I lost my balance on my way out and almost flipped the deliveries, but was balancing them in the UGLIEST possible way (using my upper torso to support the entire order while Im bent backwards scuttling to my car across the street). My second fat mistake was to drop a customer's 2 liter right in front of his very eyes, and it exploded ALL over the floor during the Superbowl rush. Soda was EVERYWHERE and I felt AWFUL for everyone helping me clean up. The final mistake I made, involved a school order and their PO. The school asked for a delivery on a weekend, but the person responsible for writing them out was off duty, since it was a weekend. Long story short, because of this insane accident that caused WAY too much of a shitstorm, we now have all of our POs emailed to us from the school district :-)"

  I know weed was mentioned earlier, but as someone who smokes all day, every day, I know that it doesn't help EVERYONE. Idk if you live in a legal state or not, but I don't, and I feel like if I had access to proper strains it would be more beneficial."
