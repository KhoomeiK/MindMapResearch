AvPD,fqrkf7b,t3_gjywq5,1589586145.0,"I just fell in love so bad that my need to talk to them, get to know them, be close to them was stronger than my fear. That‚Äôs the only way I can describe it.

To be fair, at that point my childhood memories were still safely repressed, and I thought constant anxiety was normal, I was just autopiloting through life, fell in love, had no concept of consequences and nothing to lose."
AvPD,fqriqd4,t3_gki736,1589585162.0,"I couldn‚Äôt function in my old job (too many people, horrible bosses, I was too dependent/replaceable, I never felt safe) so the labour and welfare administration is financially supporting me through a bachelor‚Äôs degree that will give me better work options, like a coder, so that I hopefully will have a job I can live with long term.

Edit: so I guess my advice would be to think about what an ideal job situation would be for you. For me, that would be 1) a job where I feel safe and needed, for that I need an education that‚Äôs in demand right now, 2) a job where I have to deal with a minimum of people in my day to day life & 3) a job that will pay me enough money to live a normal life, even if my mental health wouldn‚Äôt allow me to work full time. 

So for me I chose programming and economics, because it lets me work on the computer and not with people, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs in demand (which is both good because it makes it easier to get a job, but also it makes me feel more valuable, which in turn makes it easier to stand up for myself), and it pays enough to make me feel safe. 

I also considered archive-work, storage, or lab-work.

Edit2: do not fall in the Amazon-storage-type jobs though. Humane bosses are extremely important for people like us (for everyone really). When in interviews ask questions about the work environment and company culture and stuff. 

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm rambling, but I feel so strongly about this topic. My old job made me want to die every day. I felt so hopeless, worthless and replaceable and I never ever want to be in a situation like that ever again, and I don‚Äôt want anyone else to struggle like that either. We spend so much of our lives at work, it is SO important to have a safe environment at work."

I sometimes think I was so focused on the hurt my father caused and dealing with the aftermath of that, and so I haven‚Äôt really dealt with the pain my mother caused me.

You‚Äôve done everything right, and I‚Äôm so impressed by the way you‚Äôve handled it. Now it‚Äôs time to take better care of yourself too. Have you thought about therapy? It can help you become more aware of your feelings, which reduces your anxiety, and helps you put things into perspective. I struggle with suicidal ideation, but talking to my therapist is very grounding and validating."

CPTSD,eovzove,t3_btbgdx,1558903069.0,"I should print this out. I can‚Äôt seem to get rid of that voice in my head that insists that yes, it is my responsibility to take care of my parents, make them comfortable, make them love me, make their lives easy. But it‚Äôs not my responsibility. I feel sad that they don‚Äôt take responsibility for their own health, but that does not mean that I should pick up the slack. It‚Äôs not my responsibility. It‚Äôs just not."
