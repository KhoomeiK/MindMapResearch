Yes, I’m recognizing the deficiencies of public AND private education being funded by capitalists.

> what if you don’t like the state curriculum 

It should be a studied process, not up to individuals to decide. There’s a correct method to educate citizens effectively no matter their inclination— in Germany you get music classes as mandatory, all the way up to college, even if you want to become a scientist. Why? Because it boosts brain development — it’s not about getting “music jobs”, it’s about raising educated, intelligent, aware individuals.

But in America the corporate dictatorship, kids are seen as assets, cattle, cogs in a machine. That’s why the “private sector” has a hand in everything. We’re zombified by capitalism to serve Him as the ultimate master. The private sector wants obedient workers, desperate for a paycheck — not intellectualized free thinkers who see the truth for what it is.

Only a brainwashed American would say something like that — “send your kid to a school that focuses on arts or whatever”. See, school is not a fucking supermarket where you pick your peanut butter brand. It’s supposed to be an institution you can TRUST to deliver the highest quality, most well-rounded and complete education known to science.

YES of course in areas like healthcare and education we have to eliminate the private sector! It’s an abomination and abuse of human rights to even allow *for profit* medical and education systems. 

Anyone sane in the head with decent reasoning skills is vehemently against that"

All you can do is write sarcastic smiley faces making the childish assumption that if public education is messed up, it *must be the people/governments fault* :)

Yes if the private sector is to blame, I want to *strengthen* public institutions. NPR and PBS are some of the best content we have, and we can do the same with schools if we keep corporations out of it. Again... are you paying attention to what I’m saying?"
CapitalismVSocialism,fomncgi,t1_fomn4hw,1587896645.0,"Yes we’re the product of a public education system that was purposefully turned to shit by corporate lobbies so they could build a narrative that “private business does it better”.

I was fortunate to get my education in Europe, that’s why I can still understand the difference between problems created by “government” and problems created by corporations. To Americans that’s really hard, things get foggy"

If people had remained well educated with decent public schooling and public media like NPR and PBS, we wouldn’t have Trump today. He is the product of millions of stupid people brainwashed by Mountain Dew, Cheetos and Fox News, voting like the morons they were conditioned to be.

NPR is public - are they Trump's mouthpiece?... Doesn't Trump represent corporate and capital power more than government?

When the media is corporate-owned (like right now), doesn't that make them the official mouthpiece of corporate power?....

Even applying your logic... at least we can still (sort of) vote political powers in/out of office. Can we vote for what rich guy owns the media? Nah. Corporations don't answer to the people - never will"

There is real evidence correlating worker abuse and capitalism... but under more socialist or communist economies, that evidence is fuzzy -- workers actually tend to enjoy more rights. Watch American Factory on Netflix -- even the Chinese at one point realize American workers actually take home less and are more overworked. Yes, this is from Chinese, who literally commit suicide over workplace abuse already. The situation in the US is BAD"
