Railroaded is a word that comes to mind as well as them wanting to pin it on an innocent person vs making the responsible party.. responsible. I’m so sorry this happened to you.

This isn’t something a student or minor should have to deal with. Sending good vibes your way. ❤️"

It’s the great void of repeating unrequited .. well ..everything except unhappiness. I can’t even stand typing this. It’s quite pathetic but it’s the truth.
