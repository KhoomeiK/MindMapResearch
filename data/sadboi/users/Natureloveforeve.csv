All I can say is she did nothing wrong apart from the fact that the ink might be toxic. Coz let's be honest the Bible itself has been manipulated and some scripts which puts men on a higher pedestal is very doubtful. Why would God differentiate between the 2 genders?? Why is the Bible only written by men?? Why was Magdalena's book never included in Bible?

My mother had cancer and was leaning towards prayers. Praying isn't but she was so crazy about these Evangelists groups that she donated shit load of money to such people while me and my sis wore torn clothes, didn't have proper food to eat. We have been bullied a lot by our relatives, cousins and friends.  There were some good people who tried giving thier kids hand me down clothes to us but she would refuse to accept and donate them. She said she was teaching us to be modest. She's long gone now but those memories are still fresh in our minds. My sis still has lot of darkness in her mind.

depression,fpcechu,t3_gcj8rj,1588497362.0,"Sometimes blood relations are toxic. You had a better childhood and so you might have some expectations but please don't. Here's my story in short.My mom got cancer when I was 1 and half. She died as it relapsed in 10 yrs. All my life I saw her on bed, bathed her, cleaned her spitting dustbin full of blood. But she didn't care. We had money but she chose to donate it to Church and prayer group. Whereas I wore torn clothes and hardly had anything to eat. But this was nothing. Hell broke loose once she was gone. My relatives treated me like shit, cousins bullied me, badmouthed me. My father was away working in another city so they bitched about me to him, he believed.  Everyone made sure that I was all alone. I tried to end my life  several times but was unsuccessful as my body pulled through. Years went by I got in relationships only to realise that they where just using me whereas all I wanted was love. Again I tried to end my life but yet again I was unsuccessful. After that I decided enough is enough. What if this is only life I have, there's no second chance. I need to take control of myself. Therapy is bullshit. Most of them just want to make money. I told myself I have to be strong. Went to doctor got myself on medication. I owe nothing to nobody and I don't expect anything from anyone. I've made my mind tough as a rock and my heart cold. Nobody can do shit to me now. My relatives are shit scared of me now, as I call out their bullshit. I don't need nobody. I choose to let go of fake people calling me thier friends. I am by myself and much happy. Screw the world. Live your life. Don't let it go just coz of other people. Remember you don't owe them no shit."

The numbers are going high now due to various reasons like numbers of testing is more now, mass migrations of daily wagers last week, the tabligi incident, populated slums, people taking medicine before check at airport, people not declaring travel history, hospital not taking suspected cases seriously etc. Even though our numbers are highest statewise, My state government is doing a very good job to contain it. In Mumbai most of the areas are containment zones, even my area, if I step out if absolutely necessary I can't go more than 2 kms. Unless it's an emergency and one has a pass provided by the authorities. In city most people are taking it seriously NOW!! Today, I had gone out after 2 weeks to get groceries and medicines and I was impressed with how people are following the instructions of social distancing. Some shops have even marked circles which are 2 mtrs away for customers. 
This is what I hear every morning on loudspeaker of a police van:
Wash your hands thoroughly when you come from out.
Use mask (it's compulsory).
Maintain cleanliness and hygiene.
Clean your groceries.
Wash vegetables and fruits with salt water.
Carry sanitizer when you step out. 
Eat healthy cooked food.
Maintain social distancing .
Don't step out unless it's absolutely necessary.
Inform helplines if you feel unwell. 
Also the local authorities have been providing free food, groceries to the needy ( I saw with my own eyes)
So I feel the fear has set in a bit more now. Roads were empty compared to 2 weeks ago.
