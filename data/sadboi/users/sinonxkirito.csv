addiction,etoyrxt,t1_etnuasx,1563041114.0,"Yes, i feel like that too. At one point, when i think i can't live my life with the very bad state of my life (starting to binge-ing hard at my bad habit which is not using substance, but is very harmful too), that's when i decided to stop. And that decision really giving me power to quit.

But my other problem is, in the next few months, when i forget why i should fight hard not to give in to my old habit, that's when i start to considering whether if i should be doing that bad habit again. Hope i can figure it out, so i can always remember the reason why i need to stay away from my bad habit every time. 

Hope you doing all good. Congratulations :)"

NoFap,eshw2ob,t1_eshbqnd,1562002098.0,"Yes, i really agree, find what went wrong and try fixing that wrong moves until you can solve the wrong thing you're doing that leading you to fapping.

I strongly reccomend we must try to note everything, so we can remember what are the thing that causing us to fapping. It looks like this. If the yesterday you fap, remember again what you do at those times. If you remember you are watching some tv series that had something that arouses you, stop doing that, and write it down. Always do it, everytime we relapse, and i hope we can find some pattern and try to stop that pattern.

I pray for you to have a burning passion to always keep fighting the good fighting until eternity. And if that burning passion isn't there, please look and try literaly every way to keep you from choosing the bad options..
Thanks for taking your time to read this.."
addiction,es8vgme,t1_es7sdd0,1561716968.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that, i pray for you to always have burning passion in your heart to keep fighting the good fight until eternity.

Okay, for when my mind is in the good state as it is right now, i can understand and will choose that logical and really clear conviction about ""don't need to learn the hard way, i can get clean today and never use again/ do my bad habit again"". 
But, sometime, this conviction doesn't appeal to me when i have some really bad state of mind.. maybe I will think ""oh i have a bad day, and i am pressurred by this and that thing, why bother not doing the stuff that make me feel good?"" Do you have any tips to deal with that situation? What about meditation? are you already try it in your day to day?
Thanks again, sorry if i can't phrase my question in a better way.
Hope all the good thing for you."
