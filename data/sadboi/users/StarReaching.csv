It is not fair to take responsibility for the actions of another person, not even your sister. Don’t put that on yourself, it is not your fault. 
A couple important things to think about...

They don’t give you clues because they don’t want you to stop them - you didn’t know because she didn’t want you to know.

Also, it could have been a very impulsive action she took.

The healing in you will take time, it is not an easy road, you can always rely on others who have gone through the loss of a loved one to suicide. There are unfortunately a lot of us, and a lot of us find it healing to help others and also get help from others.

Keep talking and reaching out!

“Estes describes the effect I described as ‘collapse’ – it’s the best description I’ve ever heard for what happens to me in these situations.

Collapsing is a syndrome where when someone is angry or being negative towards you, instead of staying strong and present as an adult, you go into a psychic regression, get hooked into old feelings, feeling worthless, unprotected, not knowing what to do next, wishing to be invisible, even wishing you would die to avoid the pain of rejection and separation that you feel, the abandonment that is triggered. Instead of acting sanely in relation to the present circumstances, you journey to a horrible place in the past and react from the feelings of that place.”


And here is a link to where I got this :

I also have learned that being yelled at activates our root chakra injuries which shift us into this “place. “ 

A person  can learn to come out of this response...it takes some awareness and learning to be prepared and shift from that chakra quickly when we feel it activates be this treatment from another person.

I stopped in a shop for aromatherapy for grief and had a conversation with a woman who seemed very spiritual and intuitive which meant that she spoke with love .... here is what she shared with me...
Death is as precious as birth.

I have pondered that for the last two and half years and  have found that even as imperfect as my friends passing was - it was absolutely precious to have walked a portion of his path with him that turned out to be the last nine months he was on this earth.

Your fathers passing wasn’t perfect. You were perfect in your love for him and devotion and determination to honor him, his life, his wishes and his death.
By all the details in your post you were a precious soul/daughter that was pouring your every ounce of effort, love and even what guidance you could give him.
It’s ok that you let go of his hand for that moment. It was not a betrayal and he knows for sure without a doubt that you were advocating for him and loving him every moment.

Much love and gentle light sent your way. I’m so sorry you are grieving. <^>"

Empaths I believe need a lot of alone time or time in quiet solitude of some kind. 
Nature and meditative sounds help me a ton. I also have learned to take advantage of every opportunity I get for down time. This means sometimes declining invites to hen I know what I need is to decompress alone.

Advice,f7ucmc8,t3_dxj7b2,1574013605.0,"I so feel for you. See it’s ok and socially acceptable to call a white person a racist. So when a black person is a racist it’s almost an unheard of tenant in our culture. 

Many black people are blatantly prejudiced against whites in the city I live in. One of the worst racially immature climates I have lived in is here, I am  in a southern part of the Midwest in the USA.

I am in grad school and have observed a black professor I have giving preference to black students. Special opportunities and incentives given only to black students have been a blatant part of the culture here at the university I attend. There is no chance of addressing this without coming out bruised and having to defend why being white is not in and of itself indicative of being a racist.... no more than being black is. 

As a white woman I am horrified at the blatant prejudice and bias against whites that is allowed to exist.

I wonder if you can move on to another profession because there is no winning answer to what you are describing. At 25 years old you have time now to steer your course and hone in on a different objective/direction.  I know that you are probably a teacher for admirable reasons. The reality of life sometimes can suck the loveliness out of good intentions. I’m so sorry you are having this battle.

Ignorance combined with claims of prejudice are impossible to reason with. It does not sound like you will have any other choice but to advocate for yourself. Image that, giving the kids the best of you and then defending that you have done that to their parents. 

It is a shameless stance for a black parent to withdraw from parental responsibility and then play the race card.

AND the climate in our country is so over the top sensitive .... it’s become a difficult cross to bare being a white woman.

Also - consider removing yourself from Facebook. No good ever comes from it. I’m almost 3 years of being off of that platform. 

Sending you a hug! You sound like a good person with pure intentions.

Hope my opinions don’t seem insensitive. They are my true experience!"

My thought on that is that it could nervousness for some people that talk over you... some people are really wanting to tell you more than they want to hear you unfortunately and also some people may just not mean to be rude but kinda are since they don’t allow you to speak and finish your thoughts.... 

I get it. The reasons possibly why mental illness drove her to it... it drove my closest friend to it also.

I relate an incredible amount. I lost my sweetheart to suicide two years ago, within the next three months I found out my pet of nine years had lymphoma.... I had to put him down after dragging him to chemotherapy for 4 months and putting way more money than I have on my credit cards. 

I finally decide to go adopt another pet. I found Harry, a cat left at the animal control due to his owner passing away. Harry had been at the shelter for about two months and I went to go see him. The workers warned me how grumpy he was. I did not care because I felt certain he was grumpy like me. I’m only grumpy because of sadness really. And after getting him home with me both of us stopped feeling so grumpy rather soon.

Harry changed things around for me emotionally. I have a new reason to smile. His antics keep me laughing and he is quite a refreshing presence in my home which had become like a funeral home in the ambiance I had ended up in after losing my friend to suicide and then my pet to lymphoma six months later.

I think you should look at videos on YouTube about narcissism. I have a very similar parent and I have found that the info I find about narcissism on YouTube helps me put a name to and identify the issues I am up against with my awful parent. 
Sending you love and hope. You sounds like a very loving soul. Keep reaching for support here. 
Finally, I am truly sorry for the loss you have experienced.
Best <^>"

SuicideBereavement,f4ypyd4,t3_dm41ue,1571882366.0,"Tears. Tears and more tears. I’ve lived as a survivor for about 2.5 years .... it flooded back recently and it’s debilitating at times still. I like your resolve to advocate. I’m 100% in the same way using advocacy to heal myself and try to humbly help others
Your post is heart wrenching and inspiring also. Thank you, you helped me know it will get better.

SuicideBereavement,f4ue40f,t3_dlm51w,1571807124.0,"She left a huge task for you. Much light and healing sent your way - I’m so sorry you are facing this.
The thing I think is really important is that you do what you are comfortable with. It sounds like you’d like to honor her and respect her arrangements with you. 
It is a lot to put on someone. I think maybe just breath for a while as you process what has happened... sleep has a way or helping to the next step ...  if you can nap and sleep a bit if you are able to rest - I really think it helps in the process of grief, especially in the beginning.
it sounds like you have a strong bond with your friend.That friendship still exists even though she took her life. The connection you have will always be there. 
Also, it might help to make a drawing of your grief....I made a drawing of my grief a few days after my friend passed ... it was therapeutic in the sense that I wasn’t using words but lines and colors to express my grief and shock and guilt for not predicting it so I could have tried to stop him.
One thing I learned in processing is that the person who is planning their death the way your friend did and my friend also did.... you didn’t  know because they made sure you didn’t know .... it’s unfair. I hope you can talk to a counselor and find support. 
I hope this may help a bit. It’s just my perspective and experience. Again I am so sorry. <^>"
SuicideBereavement,f4kq3f8,t3_dktuqs,1571656069.0,"I’m so sorry you are going through all sorts of emotions. So sorry for the shock and loss of your dear beloved friend. Keep reaching for support. Keep talking  and getting the emotions out so they don’t get bottled up. This will take time to heal, there are others like me who have gone through what you are feeling. My friend hung himself in March of 2017.  I feel it has gotten less intense and I have come to accept that this was my friends choice and not something that anyone could have known he was going to do. I had a hard time with guilt. Over time I have come to realize that no one knew my friend was going to do this because he made sure no one would. Hope you find ways to lift your emotions up by loving yourself and your friend. 
Again, I’m so sorry for what you are going through."
SuicideWatch,f4gybrk,t3_dkfkaq,1571586299.0,"No suicide is not inevitable. Let your curiosity of how it will unfold keep you in this life experience. Keep reaching for guidance when you don’t know the options even if you have only yourself at times ... your life has multiple purposes and potential ... please keep going, things change sometimes for the better and other times not. Keep eliminating things and people that pull you down. Explore what options are outside of your realm of existence today.... sending you strength and love <^>"
SuicideBereavement,f4gx7j5,t3_dkh5ss,1571585973.0,What a beautiful love you have for him. This is very deep and full of love and pain. Sending you healing and lightness. <^>
GriefSupport,f4bg5y6,t3_dk7mgo,1571511986.0,Beautiful moment - yes he was connecting with you !!
SuicideBereavement,f44t22g,t3_dj8l7x,1571358304.0,"Yes, suicide is a contagion. I understand the difference you are talking about in your own thoughts. That 2% that is there now that wasn’t there before.
I have it too. My closest friend who I loved hung him self on his birthday two years ago. Suddenly I was suicidal. I hadn’t been suicidal for eleven years. I know you said you had never been suicidal. In any case, suicide was as distant to me as Antarctica. It was something that never entered my mind. Now, after the shock and the loss of him...  I now have three separate suicide plans that I have decided on in my 5%, I’m about at the 5% departure 95% stay ratio.

I get what you are talking about. I’m so sorry you have this. So sorry that your husband left in that way. 

Here is one concept that stops me.
I believe we are soulful beings... I believe when my friend died our friendship continued... continues...He is near me often. I’m open to that at times and sense a connection. Maybe your husband is with you ? Have you ever considered it possible or maybe sensed it?
What if that connection is real? 
What if in this realm our soul gets to occupy our physical bodies and in “that other side” they ( my friend, your husband) are just Energy with no body. What if your husband gets to enjoy you live the rest of your life watching your beautiful soul occupy your beautiful and expressive body.... what if he wants to enjoy that until your natural time comes and then you’d be reunited in a new and satisfying connection again with him.... 

This is an imaginative and truly hopeful theory I have come up with to fend off the suicidal thoughts when they come.

This is all with another belief I have. That is that he regrets his choice of suicide because he knows so much more now.  

I hope some of my philosophy may inspire you to have one way to cope with those thoughts when they come. 
I mostly wanted to say that yes there is a contamination of sorts .... your soul is not contaminated though. Far from it. Your emotions have been altered ...You have been traumatized like I was too. I hear you. <^> grief counseling helped me a lot with the thoughts too. Sending love and light ... keep stepping ahead one foot at a time."
SuicideBereavement,f402x4s,t1_f402tn0,1571283401.0,And thank you. It really is a horrible way to lose someone special to you. :(
SuicideBereavement,f402tn0,t1_f3ziog2,1571283317.0,"I feel compassion, glad to send some support and  hope you find a lot of gentle patience with your self... take extra care to be good to yourself. I’m sorry this all came to you in the time you are coping with your mum’s passing. It sounds like such a very difficult time right now.  I’m sorry for the shock of it all. Take care."
SuicideBereavement,f3zhodw,t3_dixhnn,1571269282.0,"It sounds like a lot of information to take in. I think its ok to feel all kinds of things and just process what you now know.
I know this about suicide, when my friend was arrested for the third time and about to go back to jail. He took his life instead. He felt so low. 
I have no doubt your dad was coping with life the best he could and if he was under circumstances that led to jail, he also was doing the best he could with the life he knew. Sometimes the cycle pulls people into the jail system and jail sort of breaks the soul for some and they seem to get tied up into that life without ever meaning too... I think you were loved and an attempt to protect you from the harsh reality made this all the secret that you now know. 
Human behavior does all kinds of strange things .... your heart will feel best if acceptance of what is and staying in a place of love.
I am soo so sorry you are faced with all of this.
Hope this may help a tiny bit. Best <^>"
GriefSupport,f3ryatr,t3_dhbg73,1571093920.0,"Sending you support. It sounds like you have learned to cope. It must be a challenge to live not knowing him. He must be so proud of you as he watches over you grow. I believe that our deceased loved ones are right there with us. He hears you. He feels your emotions and is with you through it all. 
Much love to you."
SuicideBereavement,f3rxm53,t1_f3r1n8v,1571093607.0,"Also it helps some people to journal or draw a picture of what you feel .... it’s therapeutic even if you don’t feel like an artist this can help....
I hope you have lots of support when you get back home. The emotions will feel like they are never going to lift or end. This will get better over time, lots small healing increments will happen a day at a time. I agree with the person  above that emphasized to keep going. Much love and compassion to you."
SuicideBereavement,f3r1n8v,t3_dhjudl,1571083492.0,"There is a very desperate and despairing grief that one has to face with a suicide loss. Especially your brother being a sibling and having done this at your mums house.
I am so sorry your brother left that way. There are lots of online resources, however I think the best thing may be talking to a grief counselor.
I experienced the loss of my best friend to suicide. March 20 of 2017 he hung himself on his birthday In his fathers house. It takes a lot of time. There are many people who care and are willing to help you.
Again, I am so very sad to read what has happened with your brother choosing suicide.
Sending love and light to you."
