Quick instructions:

""1 - Fill the bowl with your beads, 1/2 to 2/3 full is optimal.


2 - Curl your wire into a hook. Make sure the end of your wire is flat, not with any awkward cuts, which will make it harder for the beads to get onto the wire.


​3 - Hold the hook over the beads with the tip just skimming the top of the beads (not touching the bottom of the bowl).


4 - Spin your bowl using the spindle and the beads will jump right onto the wire. My wire tip is pointing right, so the bowl needs to be spun to the left. If you are left-handed you may need to do the opposite with your wire on the opposite side of the bowl.""

insanepeoplefacebook,fqjb5xs,t3_givud2,1589407505.0,"The Bible and Jesus himself are quite clear about obeying the law. Here are a few, of many, passages from the often unread book of their professed religion.

**Romans 2:13**  
For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.

**1 Peter 2:13-17**    
Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.

**Romans 3:31** 
Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.

 **Romans 13:1-5** 
Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience.

**Titus 3:1**

A cruise ship doesn't have numerous doctors, ventilators, nurses, etc. available to every single person. That could be several thousand people (crew and passengers). Cruises are literally floating petri dishes and had sickness breakouts on the best days prior to covid. The ventilation systems and close quarters of cruise ships make them ideal places for illness to jump from one person to the next.

Ships from the main cruise lines all will have at least one doctor and two nurses onboard. Many larger ships sail with two doctors and three or four nurses for 3000-5,000 passengers and 100-2,000 crew (usually a crew-passenger ratio 1 to .07) and they have more of an infirmary than a hospital with the very basic of medical equipment - maybe 1-2 ventilators max."

Specific to the eyes are Ocular Autoimmune Diseases where the immune system can **attack** the eyes - **not eat**.

IsItBullshit,fq8pk8h,t3_ghd64b,1589172000.0,"[According to the U.S. National Institute of Health:](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/fact-sheets/25/81/hiv-and-gay-and-bisexual-men)

In the United States, gay and bisexual men are the population most affected by HIV. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2017, adult and adolescent gay and bisexual men accounted for 70% of the new HIV diagnoses in the United States and dependent areas.

**The factors that put gay and bisexual men at risk for HIV infection?**

The already high percentage of gay and bisexual men who are living with HIV means that, as a group, they have a greater risk of being exposed to HIV.

Other factors may also put gay and bisexual men at risk for HIV infection:

*Anal sex.* Most gay and bisexual men get HIV from having anal sex without using condoms or without taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for getting HIV or passing it on to others regardless of sexual orientation.

*Homophobia, stigma, and discrimination.*  
Negative attitudes about homosexuality may discourage gay and bisexual men from getting tested for HIV and finding health care to prevent and treat HIV."

The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of things - by being tired one day, stressors, medications, not having a good diet, etc. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses.

The energy levels from 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this.

The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays."

The Portraits:

There was a hunter in the woods, who, after a long day hunting, was in the middle of an immense forest. It was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until he was clear of the increasingly oppressive foliage. After what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing. Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night. He approached and found the door ajar.

The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning. As he looked around, he was surprised to see the walls adorned by many portraits, all painted in incredible detail. Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred. Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable. Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep.

Face down in an unfamiliar bed, he turned blinking in unexpected sunlight. Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows."
