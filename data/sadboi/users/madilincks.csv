mentalillness,fljc03s,t3_fp4qih,1585206186.0,"A stressful experience or series of stressful experiences that might seem like “nothing” can overwhelm the nervous system in the same way that trauma does. I like to define trauma as anything that is too much, too soon or too fast for out nervous system to handle, especially when we can’t reach a successful resolution. Traumatic/stressful experiences do not necessarily lead to a complete breakdown in adulthood. It can lead to something like a decreased ability to feel satisfaction or emotional or physical pleasure. 

So I would say that there is a reason for your depression/anxiety/etc and it has nothing to do with your brain being “broken”. In fact, I would guess that your depression/anxiety/other symptoms are actually responses indicating that your brain is working correctly. Those symptoms are a normal and common response to any stressful or traumatic experience throughout your life that has not been resolved. I don’t know who told you that your brain wasn’t working right, but I certainly would disagree with that. That perspective tends to come from a medical model that does not incorporate a person as a whole - mind, body and spirit. 

Hope this helps!"
therapy,fl9ejdt,t3_fnci2o,1584952064.0,Look into EMDR therapy and see what you think. It is a treatment for trauma and it might be helpful!
WritingPrompts,fl38omg,t3_fktxxm,1584772939.0,"I have always felt insignificant. I mean, when you compare me to the rest of my family, I am insignificant. Sometimes I think that I was born just so they could become stronger and better able to fix and restore anything. I am the best at destroying everything and they are the best at fixing. It has always made sense...until last night. 

I was out at dinner with a friend. She has been going through a rough time lately and has been seeing a trauma therapist to deal with some issues from her past. She began talking about a memory from childhood where her father was screaming at her. She didn’t remember much from this memory, but she said that she saw the image of his face, red hot with anger. She said that she felt terrified and that her stomach was turning over and over until she felt like she was going to puke. 

That’s when it happened. Everything went black for a few seconds. I was transported into an intersection of brightly colored light streams crossing over each other like I-85’s spaghetti junction. The streams of light were buzzing and hissing, changing colors and shapes rapidly. I didn’t have to think. In fact, when I tried to think logically, a piercing noise screeched and the entire network of light streams turned into a dark, endless abyss of nothing. I quickly adapted and brought myself out of my head and into my body, though I had no idea what the hell was going on. 

I slid down a neon purple stream of light. As I was sliding, dark clouds rushed in rapidly and I felt empty, scared and alone. I ducked underneath the clouds and rushed down another connected light stream. There was a loud, grumbling voice trying to tell me something.  I couldn’t make out the words, but I felt hopelessness and worthlessness rush over me and beginning to crush my chest and construct my lungs. As I traveled further down the pathway, it became darker. I was transported into a dream-like fog and I was drowning slowly in a lake. The water was heavy and I sunk deeper and deeper until I reached the dense sandy bottom. I felt my lungs fill with water as parts of me began to escape faster and faster. 

I had never felt so empty before in my life. I sunk deeper into the hazy, lifeless fog until I saw another light stream appear and fly past me. I lifted my limp, tired body off of the bottom of the lake and rushed into the light stream. Shame, guilt, powerlessness, emptiness, anger, sadness, and hopelessness began to pulse through my veins. I could feel them as they heated up inside my body, swirling around and getting hotter and hotter. 

And then everything became light and cool. The light became less harsh and the darkness faded away all around me. I stepped off of the light stream and I was back in the restaurant with my friend. I felt exhausted. My friend looked calm, bubbly and at peace. 

“What the fuck just happened?!” I shouted loudly. My friend looked confused and remarked, “I don’t know, but damn, you look like shit.” 

I felt like shit. And then slowly, as I ate my mall Chinese food, I began to feel stronger. I could tell that the feelings were unrelated to the MSG in my food, but they were still strange and unfamiliar. 

My friend has constantly found herself in one shitty relationship after the other, always questioning herself and her sanity. She has never known her worth. Fights with her boyfriend send her into an intense, full body panic. She can’t think. She has had deep feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and despair. She often wonders what is wrong with her or why she can’t do anything right. She’s gone to countless therapists and only seems to feel more stuck. She doesn’t feel this way anymore. 

She can’t explain any of it but she often laughs and mentions our dinner that night. That was the last time she can remember feeling those deep, painful emotions and shame for who she is. She feels light and whole. She respects herself and sets boundaries with others. She finds herself in the company of people that make her feel safe. She feels whole and fulfilled. She doesn’t overthink as much anymore. She lets things happen and embraces each moment without pain, fear, nightmares, and flashbacks. She experiences moments fully as they come and feels connected in those moments.

I think that I might have a knack for fixing something different than the rest of my family. Unless I have schizophrenia."
