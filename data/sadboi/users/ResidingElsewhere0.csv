I don't feel that way anymore. I'll still look in the mirror sometimes and think ""oh I really look tired today"" but i don't feel worse as a person for it. 
Things slowly changed as I improved my social skills, improved depression, and gained healthy relationships. Things improved as situational factors influencing my depression became less a part of my life (mostly gaining independence from a dysfunctional family). Those thoughts of hating to look in the mirror are really toxic and complex. I don't think of my self as ugly anymore, and though my appearance change some, mostly my confidence and mental health improved. 

There are reddit pages for people seeking advice to improve their appearance. A change in appearance can provide a confidence boost, which is awesome! But you'll also need to address the complex factors influencing those thoughts."

I don't think anyone suggested a large age gap. Sexual selection is based on many culture influences and social status growth.

Good luck OP. There's a wide spectrum of sexual needs, and you'll find someone compatible with you. I don't know how common micro penis is, but I dated a young guy with ED who had very similar reactions from females who laughed at him. You might find some applicable advice from those circles. 
Also, as you know, there are lots of ways to please a woman.

Went out to the club with friends. Stayed later than anticipated making sure everyone else made it home safe. I lived in a village a 15 minute motorcycle ride away. Decided I wanted to go home and sleep in my own bed. Went to the street light in the road to get a bike, though there's not a lot out that late and I know id be paying more. Two bikes stop while I'm alone in the road. The two men told me their not taxi bikes and won't give me a ride and I'm a women who has no reason to be out. Just kept saying I'm a women and shouldnt be out. Asking what I was doing out. They're scaring me now. An actual taxi bike pulls up, I immediately jump on and tell him I'll pay whatever to take me home. He drives off and the other two speed after us, following, yelling at us. There's no street light now and it's super dark. Then a truck pulls in front of us barricading the road. Bike stops. I jump off and book it back to where my friends were. Just think "" Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I'm in danger."" Some men run after me, grabbing my arm. Telling me to stop. There's a ditch and wall to my left and dark ass road with no where to go but i try to keep walking. I realize one of the men is a police officer, the truck in the dark was a police truck. They demand I go with them. I'm completely surround by nonpolice men (about 10) against a ditch/wall and this police truck of 5 male officers are telling me I have to come with them and I don't fucking trust them. I tell them who I work for and call my safety coordinator, who is a very well qualified woman. (It's our protocol to call the safety coordinator for something like this.) They call their boss. I talk to their boss, being talked over and down too as some dump woman making a fuss. I was pretty demanding with the boss that he has no need to talk to me so, I have a safe place to return to, and I don't feel safe with the police. Meanwhile, an officer is on the phone with my safety coordinator and I can tell she's getting no where. Same condescending treatment. We switch phones back. My safety coordinator says the police are going to take me and I need to calm down. But the police boss tells the officers to let me go. I wasn't far from my friends and just booked my scared ass back to them and crashed with them. 

I want to acknowledge I don't know the intent of any man their and I was not injured in anyway. Outside of this event I felt safe in this country. Harassed frequently as a women, but no actions to harm me ever occured. However, I'm aware of sexual assualts that had occurred. It was dump to travel alone that late anywhere in the world. Most of all, I want to acknowledge this incident would have ended very differently for a host country national or foreign woman of color. They may have not been stopped at all or not been able to leave the police.

What was going to be a weekend visit from my sister has been her living in my would be study room for 7 months. She is a very loud presence and always has TV or some other noise going. That combined with other behaviors feels like there's this constant intrusion preventing me from clearing my head.
Anxiety,fgr570y,t3_ewbhpn,1581038431.0,Something I realized in my early 20s was in furrow my brow and relax my face (which goes with the clenched jaw). It helped me present a more accurate me than before.
AskReddit,fghs3up,t1_fgenlsu,1580792283.0,Agreed. All would agree. Except for mother.

MechanicAdvice,fge57yd,t1_fgc6h2o,1580691642.0,"Thank you! Found actuators affordably priced on RockAuto.com. Watched replacement videos for my model and it's something I can do. Since it may be the BCM, I'm gonna check the power supply before ordering actuators."
AskReddit,fge3nf5,t1_fgctekc,1580690612.0,"My friend did this when he started working at a big tech company living on the west coast where he knew no one. One weekend he volunteered as valet for a benefits concert. Just this super smart, triple digits bitch parking your car for you for free to make some friends and add value to life."
AskReddit,fge39za,t1_fgcfacy,1580690366.0,My mom bought a large one off Facebook Marketplace and paid way too much for it. She gave it to me without warning. I had a super small apartment I was moving into and that was her way of paying back money I lent her. Love her to pieces. But man she pays way too much for things. It ultimately became a bad pantry/liquor shelf.
Vaping,fg990l7,t3_euz1k0,1580635787.0,Thank you for all the responses their all super thorough and I appreciate it!
MechanicAdvice,fg98diz,t1_fg92fj3,1580635510.0,"Do you know if it's common/possible for a faulty actuator to lock properly and only fail to unlock? I keep googling this possibility, but can't find it."
MechanicAdvice,fg8nste,t1_fg8k7k7,1580625833.0,Thank you so much!
FuckYouKaren,fg89ese,t3_ewzoxb,1580613083.0,Had a friend who's mom would drop him off at Barnes and Noble during the day. He's a really good reader.

Frugal,fg7qzx0,t3_ex4yxg,1580599279.0,"A French press changed my relationship with coffee. I just use heavy whipping cream now. No sugar, because it doesn't need it. I personally use Cafe Bustelo, bc it cheaper and taste really good. 
To second a point made earlier, cafes can provide a space. So living across form a Starbucks, I go there to study and avoid distractions and loud people at home. But the coffee is better and cheaper at home."
sewing,fg7m9ty,t3_exaryo,1580595957.0,I love this!
AskReddit,fg5ue68,t1_fg4s27o,1580539277.0,When I was 9 or 10 yo. I saw my mom take Tylenol PMs and thought if I took enough regular Tylenol it help me sleep. Luckily I didn't recognize the difference between ibuprofen and acetaminophen (Tylenol) which were used interchangable in my house. I took like 12 ibuprofens trying to sleep one night. Years later I realized I could have died had I taken that many acetaminophen. I still don't know if the ibuprofen did any damage.
Frugal,fezfb83,t1_fetv6k0,1579456752.0,"Same. My (Pixel 3) service works fine in NYC. My partner (iPhone 8) has some service issues. Partner is convinced the iPhone 8 has an older, less effective antenna, but it might be variance in the Visible service. 

Mint mobile was a service I really liked in 2017-18. Moved abroad, came back, returned to Mint.. and the service was useless. But I never tried it in NY."
aww,fet1gy4,t3_eqhl8k,1579370917.0,Needs a NSFW label bc now I'm crying without context in open office space.
