sketches,f3tq7jk,t3_di2ag9,1571143179.0,"Okay, step 1, focus on hands and feet. Step 2, learn the groups of muscles that work together, draw those from different angles and practice them in motion step 3 practice them all together with figure drawing and Step 4, repeat entire process. I hope that helps some"
sketches,f3tl7ud,t1_f3tku5f,1571138643.0,"Yes and no, hands and feet yes, but for example back muscles (if u wanna get the jist of it quick) I would learn to do as a whole from different angles. One tip that helped with motion is that whenever a muscle is flexed like the biceps the opposite is stretched/relaxed such as triceps. Take the body in chunks like arms and torso etc and draw them as much as you can stand if u don‚Äôt want to take the time to get too in-depth.  Sorry I hope this is helpful"
ICanDrawThat,f3tgzvj,t3_dhegsp,1571133700.0,Okay so my personal fav was octopus samurai. And since two others tied i decided to choose the lab coat cat. It‚Äôll be awhile but I‚Äôm almost done with the octopus and next will be the cannon cat lol. Ill make sure to post them when they are complete. Thanks for the fun guys
sketches,f3tfko3,t3_di2ag9,1571131811.0,"The best way is to look, draw, repeat. I‚Äôve been working on this myself and really there is no ‚Äúquick‚Äù trick. Learn about the bones, muscles, etc. but studying the figure and drawing it over and over and over is the best way.  You can break it up into parts, highlight, or whatever but like I said, it‚Äôs repetition ( in my opinion) that makes people better at it."
