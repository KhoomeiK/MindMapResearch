She isn't my girlfriend, never will be, never had one either. Im simply too fucked up for anyone to love.

Its not that i want to end my life with 30, its more like the last straw, without that limit i would have killed myself a long time ago. But with that i got a light at the end of the tunnel so no matter how bad shit gets ill try till im 30. At least i hoped so but lately im not so sure if i can manage keeping that deal. If shit goes on like this ill be dead in about a year."

SuicideWatch,f8x3k4s,t1_f8x2u1b,1574907285.0,"Oh someone is trying to judge about people he doesn't know, if that aint something new. Listen K  is a bit dumb, he didn't have any bad intentions he just doesnt rlly know how to handle feelings either. And its not like im worried just now either. Ive been there from the beginning and i tried whatever the fuck i could to minimize the damage since its not my fucking life so i cant just barge in and kick someone on the face like o wanted to do. 
Everything went kinda ok till he came again and that was the point where i went to talk to him, A was mad as fuck at me because she knew i was about to tell him to fuck off if he aint serious. The talk didnt happen tho because i crashed my car that night but he realised he fucked up on his own wich is good for starters. I still talked to him afterwards and he obidiently agreed to stay the fuck away this time because A surely cant handle any more than that.

Im not really sure what you're trying to say with you're comment because it seems like you're blaming me for trying to make K look good wich isnt the point of this at all. If you got any tips on how i can help A then stop being a dick and tell me please."
AskReddit,f8x1kzk,t1_f8ti897,1574905767.0,"My whole family caused me trouble by maling me the black sheep, nobody but my mom, gramdma and grandpa ever belived me when i said i didnt do something. Everyone just saw my father in me and was constantly telling me im like him while also telling me that hes a piece of shit. Wich he really is, there's no doubt about that but it still hurt to be the bad guy just because i exist. 

It kinda makes sense ig. But its not mainly about my parents. Especially not my dad, he can burn in hell for all i care. I feel like a burden to my friends too wich is why i usually highly dislike talking about myself because people just tend to get overwhelmed or they dont care at all. I made a mistake and told the girl i fell for about some of my problems and that i intend to end it when im 30. Now she thinks a lot about only having a bit more then 6 years left with me wich isnt helping her already unstable mental state."

Its not the most painful thing i guess but it only hurts while i do it and unlike cuts it doesn't annoy me with a weird burning sensation if something touches it. Probably because i burn away the nerv end wich means i wont ever feel anything on that spot inless that stuff can heal.

I'm an atheist, a nihilist to be precise, i feel like o deserve it because i hurt everyone around me, i dont want to but it always happens, i feel lile a burden to everyone and it fucks me up really bad.

I wasnt really aroused for months, not even when I was in ned with the girl i love. I tried masturbating a few times but it just doesn't give me any pleasure anymore. Its more like some tedious work than anything else.

Excuse the typos, im tired af and kinda high rn."
AskReddit,f8ml6ju,t1_f8mkxbn,1574632416.0,Im male. Ig im not that sensitive when it comes to pain but yes i feel the burning. It feels good because i feel like i deserve the pain. It just feels like im doing the right thing as i said.

SuicideWatch,f8dflfv,t1_f8det4k,1574488769.0,"I mean its not the only thing thats keeping me down, i have a lot of other problems too like, my whole family is a shit show, i was pretty much all alone for years since i was 11 because my mom had to work 2-3 jobs to keep my fat ass well fed and i feel kinda guilty about it since i didnt realize how much she struggled, didnt have any friends for years and when i finally found some they all left me because i fucked up, this happend a few times tbh. I used to bully people to cope, people always leave me, and i never had any relationship since im just ugly af. All that and probably some other stuff that im too tired to think off makes me absolutely despise myself. The girl is just the cherry on top of the cake.

I like listening to the stories of other people since i can learn much from them, i am pretty weird myself and i lack any social skills. People think im just the ""thinker"" type wich is only half of the truth. I dont know how to talk to people, somehow it always works out but i always feel like im at the edge of a cliff and the slightest mistake would make me fall down.
Im happy you met someone as great as your husband and glad you could find happiness since you seem like a wonderful person :) 

Yes im still at home and i think ill go to sleep since its almost 7 am. Thanks for being here ^^"

Im going to kill myself eitherway but im not sure im able to stay strong for as long as i have planed. 

Im sorry you had to go through that, feelings are a tough thing and im sure you're lovable, you took your time to try cheering up a total stranger afterall.

I feel like ending everything right, right here. Im now home, my moms at work so im drinking to numb the pain at least a bit, i wish i had some drugs on me tho."

Recently i fell in love with a girl, we almost fucked too but since im just too fucked up to even get horny it didn't work. Now shes at some dudes place probably fucking, yes she knows i love her, she also fucked a ""friend"" of mine, her and the friend are the only people that know about my affection for her.

This putting her in a bad light but she has her reasons and i understand it but it doesn't change the fact that i feel like im not enough and never will be.

After a pretty hard mental breakdown like a week ago i started burning myself because i dont know how else to cope anymore.

Dont get me wrong i felt like shit before too but ffs i prefere my days of isolation over this rn.

Nobody will ever love me and i cant even blame them. Im so fucked up im surprised every time someone doesnt run away in disgust when they talk to me."

 I've been feeling low for about 10 years now and while stuff got better periodically, with every raise theres an even bigger drop. Every time i get my hopes up and feel better i just end up falling even lower, yearning even more for death. Drugs dont help anymore either, friends just amplify the loneliness and work makes me feel physically worse and worse every day.

I made a pact that i wont kill myself for a few years but honestly im not sure i can keep my promise. Not that my friend would care anymore either.

That and my mother are pretty much the only reason why i didnt off myself already."
