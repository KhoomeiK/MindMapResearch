>have any of you been turned off by people who are... a bit TOO happy/upbeat?

I need a bit of cynicism, pessimism, nihilism, and dark humor. Otherwise, I can't connect with people."
Vent,fr174vj,t3_gm2lji,1589814516.0,"I can relate. I don't smoke anymore, but when I did I never enjoyed smoking with other people. It always made for some uncomfortable, awkward situations. I never enjoyed picking up a bag, because they'd always want to smoke me out, and I just wanted to get out of there. I prefer being on my own, doing my own things, getting lost in my head, etc."

I'll bet some INFJs are extremely meticulous with their planning and organization, maybe even using a planner and strictly adhering to it, but I've never been like that.

infj,fq5smck,t3_gh0f2w,1589116349.0,"Yeah, we're huge planners. That's our J. But I don't think it means we plan everything.

DeepThoughts,fq3u2lw,t1_fq3swuv,1589070280.0,"Yeah, they refer to the functions. Fi is introverted feeling, Si is introverted sensing. The loop happens when you turn inward and utilize those introverted functions rather than other, extroverted functions. The loop can be beneficial to understand personal issues, but it can also lead to unhealthy thought processes. There's a lot to it, and I'm no expert by any means, so I'll include a link for you at the bottom. A quick Google search will also give you some good resources.

Out of curiosity, what makes you worry about being a good person? I know there's the obvious answer, but I'm curious as to why that is so important to you deep down."

I think introversion/extroversion is more about how you recharge your social batteries. If you feel drained in social settings and need alone time to get your social energy back, you're probably an introvert. If you feel drained when you're alone and feel energized the more you're around people, you're probably an extrovert."
