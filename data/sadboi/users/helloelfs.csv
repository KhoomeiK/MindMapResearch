People that are supposed to love you and do anything but are the ones with shortcomings, not you. Please hang in there. Also it's normal to feel the way you do, please don't beat yourself up. You can't be a perfectionist when it comes to the mind. Those thoughts aren't who you are - just weather. Just shows that you're not getting emotional needs met and are in a lot of pain. No one thinks 'purely' all of the time and you are so worthy of love."
SuicideWatch,fltcm4r,t3_fqzflg,1585467228.0,"I have no one either and I'm like you, I need people. I don't have anyone to video call/phone. Certain friends that could reach out have blatantly left me out and shown their true colours. I've never felt this suicidal. I don't have the motivation either to do stuff."
SuicideWatch,fltc1ee,t3_fqtx8q,1585466565.0,"So, so much. You hit the nail on the head."
