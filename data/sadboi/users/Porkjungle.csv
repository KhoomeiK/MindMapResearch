I struggle with mental illness, sometimes I can't have good days. But I fucking love that kid, I do almost all the parenting, she's doing well because of the support she has at home. 

Being a good parent comes from being a good person. Mental illness doesn't turn you into a shitty person. If you're shitty that's on you, that's not bipolar disorder's fucking fault."

If you rack up a bunch of hospital bills and you're broke you can apply for relief through the hospital. My boyfriend just had 20k in hospital bills even with health insurance from surgery and 8 days stuck recovering in there. He's recently unemployed and so they gave him a 100% discount, no joke."

She's on a rock climbing team and I see her sprawled out on the ground in a mess of blood and broken bones. I hate it.

You say you can't create, but you created this post. Writing is a form of expression. You say maybe you don't care if you continue to live but you wrote this post to reach out and that makes it clear (at least to me) that you totally want to stay alive.

Every single relationship suffered, from love to family to work, I made a mess of them all. Time didn't help, but therapy did. Unfortunately it's a shit load of work, and none of it comes easy.

Like pushups, jumping jacks, bicycle kicks, easy stuff you can do at home.
