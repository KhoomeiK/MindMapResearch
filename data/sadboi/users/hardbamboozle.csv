MortalKombat,fpphd1j,t1_fpo9jja,1588802292.0,I've bought the standard edition on launch day and dropped 40$ for KP1. At least give Standard Edition players a discount (20-25$ would be an acceptable price) and premium edition players the same discount with a couple of exclusive skins or something.
MortalKombat,fpph0xu,t1_fpo8jkj,1588802116.0,They know what they're doing. For a lot of people the game has gotten stale because they were disappointed with Spawn and other DLC characters such as Terminator. So releasing new content might make the game a bit more fun for said players. There's probably a lot of people who will buy this extension even though they don't agree with the price because of this issue.
MortalKombat,fpodm16,t3_gemyu0,1588782710.0,"I love MK and characters individual stories (from Towers) but I play fighting games because of the competitive nature of them.

I never play the main story in fighting games because I think it's a waste of time. Nothing against people who do enjoy stories in fighting games.

So if I would buy the expansion I would essentially pay 40$ for 3 characters which is a disgusting price tag.

I agree with you that the pricing doesn't make any sense for people who play since launch and paid 70$ for the standard edition or the premium edition which I think was 90$.

I think they should do it like Star Wars BF2 which has an upgrade expansion which is like 25$.

I already paid 40$ for KP1 which was fine considering that it included 6 characters.

I hope that this decision bites them in the ass a bit because new players get the best deal here but players who play since launch get screwed."

MortalKombat,foc86s1,t1_foc7vmf,1587668246.0,Buffing variations would be a great start to improve the game. Certain characters have a 3rd variation so NRS can say that every character has 3 of them. Some are just useless and feel like they were put together in 5 minutes.
MortalKombat,foc7okq,t3_g6mmeq,1587668073.0,"One thing that frustrates me is that certain moves or even characters can't be punished.

Kabal is safe on all of his strings no flawless block gaps.

The Joker has a safe meter less launcher and is also pretty much safe all the time. He has a launcher which is (I think) -20 on block but can't be punished by the majority of the cast.

That's a problem a lot of characters have. They have unsafe moves but because of the pushback it can't be punished.

Moves that have a KB tied to them need to be punishable like Jacqui's Punch.

There is basically no risk/reward for certain characters which is frustrating.

Certain FB's can't be punished.

50/50's shouldn't be safe.

Sub Zero's slide is punishable but sometimes my (Skarlet) 123 string just whiffs on the first part (first being the 1 part) which gives the oppenent time to block."

MortalKombat,fobvyso,t1_fobve3n,1587664272.0,Adding the run mechanic is a great idea. They could add it and make it cost 1 bar of defensive meter. Which would also maybe get rid of the very frequent breakaways.
MortalKombat,fob8rgs,t1_fob6345,1587657284.0,"As a Skarlet main I know what a useless tournament variation move is haha. I think with balance patches this could work. For example if Terminator uses Terminate make him recover like Shang Tsung when he steals a soul.

I think generally what people want from MK11 is more ""freedom"". If you play MKX it feels like a sandbox, compared to MK11. So many combos to come up with. In MK11 you can learn a character in about 15 to 20 mins. That's why I actually won't buy KP2 because characters lack depth in gameplay."

MortalKombat,fnrrn27,t3_g3drxc,1587198965.0,"What I don't understand is when NRS makes a character don't they see that a character is total ass? It's like they made him bad on purpose. MK11 has a big problem with archetypes.

Let's look at Sonya what is this character supposed to be? A rushdown character or a zoner? Oh wait she's both. And the same goes for other characters as well.

Some characters have oppressing zoning and great up close pressure. For example Sub Zero. Not only do you have to  to guess all the time against him up close but he also has great zoning. At least make his Axes unsafe. The same goes for Kabal.

This makes the characters who actually are designed to perform a certain way look weak in comparison for example let's look at Skarlet. Skarlet should have the upper hand at full screen against Sonya, Liu Kang and Johnny Cage but no she doesn't and up close Skarlet is bad because she was designed to be a zoner.

So what is Shao Kahn supposed to do in this game? His spear is slow as hell. He has strings which he should be able to cancel but can't. His buffs are hard to get out in a real match. He has pretty much only one KB he can get in a match.

I hope NRS comes with a big update to change certain things about MK11 not only characters but mechanics as well."

MortalKombat,flz70ej,t1_flxzlso,1585616920.0,"Skarlet is a zoner who can get outzoned from rushdown characters like Sonya, Liu Kang and Johnny Cage. She has a string which leaves her at +6 (or 5 don't know anymore) but both hits are highs. She is probably the easiest character to flawless block. Her KB's are pretty bad. For some reason NRS decided that Skarlets far teleport is so good that it costs 2 defensive bars. The only real combo starter she has is unsafe (Joker has a safe meterless combo starter). The only thing Skarlet excels at is at getting life back. Her parry which is her only good KB (besides universal D2 kb) gives you a decent amount of life back and one of her projectiles gives her life back as well. She's got the most damaging FB too. She really needs some type of buff. In her first tournament variation she has one of the most useless moves in the game, if they would exchange it with a different move that could be a small but great buff."

Someone at NRS was like lets put a wig on Kotal, let's recolor Jacqui's base skin and make small changes to Erron Black. Not buying KP2. Only buying Ash. The whole KP1 was pretty much disappointing. Terminator, Sindel and Shang are boring to play because they barely require any execution. Jokers set up variation is fun.

That way I can figure out if my opponent is using a lot of throws, unsafe strings, likes to poke, likes to stagger or if he's D2 happy.

Also I don't think a lot of people use the Kombat Breakdown in between KL matches. Which is also helpful."
MortalKombat,eyobyqa,t3_cxxjsv,1567273920.0,"His F4 3 string would be more acceptable to deal with if it didn't have a KB that can lead to a 50% combo in the corner.

I hate KB's and how unbalanced they are. I main Skarlet and her KB's are a joke. 

KB and FB are the additions to MK11 I genuinely don't like."
gaming,eyn6zsu,t3_cxh3r1,1567234341.0,"2K is the worst. I played the mode in 2K19 and haven't spent a single dime on it. After some time I got a ""special offer"" from 2K. They wanted me to buy virtual currency to open packs. This offer only appears for people who don't spend money in this mode. 2K basically wants people to pay for digital cards that don't have any value. Fuck that. 

I love the idea of the mode. Current and legendary NBA players playing on one team that's why I play it. As I said I haven't spent a single dime in this mode. I play 2K since 2K11 (which was the greatest of them all imo) and since 2K16 I only buy the game when it's on sale."

Games,eycl40u,t1_eycbwif,1567003473.0,"The worst part is that the official NBA 2K MyTeam Twitter always posts when new cards are released in their packs (lootboxes) and people act like they dropped some meaningful content. 

Are they brain dead?  They're updating their fucking slot machine and you say ""thank you, I'm gonna open packs when I come home.""
I hate people who don't see the bigger picture with shit like that. Every year it gets worse. Maybe  not buying packs would help? Oh no I must be crazy."
MortalKombat,eycfsbz,t3_chlbuv,1567001291.0,As a D'Vorah main I hate how people who mash D1 or D2 get away with so much shit. She doesn't have a fast mid. Jailing people with her D1 into her 1 2 string isn't easy online against people with 180 ping.

 In KL it's more of a disrespect thing I think. Opponent doesn't see you as a threat."
