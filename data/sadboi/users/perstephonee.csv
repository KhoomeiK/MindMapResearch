Avoidant,fqyyiba,t1_fqyxp77,1589756753.0,"I was thinking about that as well, but it will probably be very difficult for you and it may take a long time for him to work through. I don’t mean to sound pessimistic but it’s definitely difficult for me to put things on other people so I like my space when I need to work through emotions, he could definitely be different though. Try having a conversation with him about triggers, if he knows what he needs to minimize these triggers you definitely can stick around. But avoidance is tricky, it can be very difficult to want to work on yourself and that can be very hard on the people close to them. I wouldn’t want you to suffer is all"
Avoidant,fqywx0f,t3_glmqm8,1589755963.0,"I can definitely relate to this behaviour. Usually I start pushing people away when I feel as if they’re abandoning me. This feeling can come from something as simple as a wrong look, change in tone of voice, the feeling that the other person is withdrawing (even if it’s for a good reason like dealing with their own struggles and needing alone time), etc. So I can definitely see this being the case with your boyfriend as well. 

I think he’s probably confused and hurt, he’s probably feeling anxious about the state of your relationship most days. This is not your fault at all, the way you act sometimes may trigger him into feeling these things but unless he can sit down with you and share all those triggers and honestly work on minimizing his ability to be triggered than I don’t think things can work out between you two. This is also most likely why he tries to end things so often, some part of him probably doesn’t fully understand why he gets so triggered and it can seem very daunting trying to figure them out as well as how to fix them. 

Sorry this was so long, and I could be way off base but the behaviours you described are very familiar to me. I was only able to fully work on those behaviours once I took some time away from romantic relationships and spent time building my own self esteem. It seems like he has some stuff to work through and if he can’t do that while in a relationship you’ll, unfortunately, have to let him go."
CPTSD,fqw9c80,t3_gl38uk,1589696650.0,"I definitely relate to this. Personally I think it’s because my parents tend to gaslight me or find round about ways of blaming me when I try to tell them I don’t like something they say or do. I try to notice when I’m invalidating myself and instead think “just because someone else may have it worse does not make my pain any less relevant.” Pain is pain, emotional or physical, and unfortunately a big part of our pain tolerance is found in genetics. Trauma, and other mental disorders are generally passed down through generations so some of the trauma may not even be a reflection on you specifically but your family history. Hopefully that helps you too, I think this type of trauma too can be so frustrating to deal with because someone else usually puts it there and we had no way of stopping that so in a way it feels hopeless but that’s when you can start too look at it as an power move. My family dumped all this trauma on me but guess what? I’m going to fix it!"
AvPD,fqw2hj8,t3_gl6a99,1589691028.0,"I can definitely relate, I feel almost repulsed when people express concern for me and I immediately try to change the subject. You are not alone ❤️"
NPD,fqvg3dj,t1_fqvewfe,1589676529.0,"Check for online programs, or even just some phone apps for journaling and mood checking, you can start charting the way you feel daily and some of your recurrent thoughts and then bring them up to someone when they’re available. It may also be helpful if you can’t get to talk to someone right away to start reading some books on narcissism, if you have audible they usually have some good ones. I’m not sure what’s available in Sweden but good places to start would be: “You Might Be A Narcissist If...” by Paul Meier, Lisa Charlebois, and Cynthia Munz and “Narcissism: Denial of the True Self” by Alexander Lowen"

NPD,fqvax5a,t1_fqtnokr,1589673421.0,"You can start with a school counsellor, ask them to help you find a therapist, psychologist, or counsellor to see outside of school as well however those will cost some money and you may need to ask your parents help paying for the sessions if you can’t afford them yourself. A counsellor won’t be the best source unfortunately but at least it’s something for now until you can talk to someone who’s more specialized."
NPD,fqrszm9,t3_gklf27,1589591255.0,"Unfortunately when it comes to diagnosing personality disorders, you cannot be diagnosed if you are still a teenager because the hormones and peer pressure can be causing a lot of those symptoms. My recommendation would be to continue researching and try to get in to talk to a professional but don’t concern yourself with the diagnosis just yet. You can still find ways to correct the behaviours you dislike without having to put the label on it exclusively because as I mentioned before a lot of doctors may refuse to diagnose it yet. If you start talking to someone now they may even be able to recommend treatment for you in the future, like a specific therapy or program. The first step though is to talk to someone and target those behaviours."
CPTSD,fqortci,t3_gjw1e0,1589522984.0,"I relate to this so much. Isolation has become my safe space and it’s very difficult to let people in if I want to, let alone when I get so turned off of people that I can’t stand being near anyone. You’re definitely not alone, hopefully we can figure out a way to trust/open up more in time."

I keep coffee in my room, a stockpile of food beside the fridge and in the fridge, and I have a collection of mugs that I keep in my room as well.

The baristas at the Starbucks I live near know me and my sister because we both go in there so often, and every Starbucks near a job I’ve worked has gotten to know me as a regular as I usually go to Starbucks on my lunch breaks no matter where I work.

TheStaircase,fpat9va,t1_fpaskb2,1588455248.0,"Okay fair but that’s a cat, a cat is significantly more vicious than an owl so that attack actually makes sense, why would an owl randomly viciously attack a human, and personally of someone were to be flying around my head making me unable to see I would probably feel the need to scream whereas a cat isn’t blocking vision or near your face"

TheStaircase,fp8d7x1,t1_fp8czw0,1588389386.0,"The tape wasn’t heard from inside because that was inside, she would’ve been attacked on her way in from the pool, so she would’ve been outside with no walls or door absorbing the sound plus she’d be closer to where Michael was so he should’ve heard something, the tape was only to test if her heard her screaming inside not outside"
TheStaircase,fp8aavf,t3_gbya98,1588387395.0,Another thing that doesn’t make sense with the owl theory: if KP was attacked by an owl wouldn’t she scream? If she screamed wouldn’t MP hear her? And if he heard her why didn’t he go help immediately?

In high school, I started browsing 4chan groups to warn people that we’re being targeted (at the time they were targeting people on insta telling them to kill themselves, most of them were already depressed/suicidal).

interestingasfuck,fowcvv3,t1_fow3c0k,1588117335.0,"Fun twist on this story, Zeus actually knew the whole time, he had actually given Hades permission to take her. Since Persephone is Zeus’ daughter as well, Hades never ran it by Demeter and nether did Zeus, he only reluctantly got involved when Demeter refused to grow the crops and the humans began starving. Even more fun twist, all of Persephone’s children are the result of Zeus tricking her by pretending to be Hades to sleep with her. In my opinion the whole story is often misunderstood, making Hades out to be a bad guy when in reality Zeus orchestrated the entire thing."
