It’s not offensive to say that, it’s just true. Take Jessica yaniv for example. According to them they’re a transwomen but we all know they’re just a perverted man in a dress. Also we don’t know if she supports them, from everything I’ve seen she’s supported their free speech. Even if I disagree with places such as the westboro Baptist church, I still support them in the sense that nobody should be able to stop them from doing what they choose to do as long as it hurts nobody else directly. There was a woman fired for being openly transphobic and not wanting trans women in the women’s bathroom. This is where Rowling said #istandwithmaya, and tbh so do I. Even though I don’t agree with her and she may not with me, that’s nothing to be fired over if you’re just voicing your opinions. Saying that all trans people are rapists is different. Saying you don’t think they should be in the same bathroom is an opinion."

Also don’t you think god would want all to be happy whether or not they praised Jesus. And what makes you so convinced that your religion is correct, and others aren’t just as correct? Even though I may not agree with you, if you harm none then do as you will. But saying that true happiness can only come from worshipping someone is a fear tactic and somewhat cult like.

I’m not Christian but I am Wiccan and my faith is really just about not hurting others and spreading love, that’s the main part of it, the foundation really. It makes me sad that others can’t see that we all just should be kind and loving. I’ve also been accused of working with the devil, which I don’t believe in I just believe in balance and polarity, mostly just because of witchcraft, which in reality isn’t what most think of it as. It’s really just positive, at least if you’re speaking to a Wiccan, I can’t really speak for others, but it’s really all just about harnessing the energy around you and directing it a certain way. It’s all about intention really. There was a Japanese scientist that found that water molecules make very gorgeous and beautiful shapes when told positive things, like you’re beautiful, playing classical music, while if it were the negative things being told or played to it it would create very distorted and negative shapes. It even worked when the words lovely and fool were written and paper and taped to it. Really quite crazy. And I mean we are 70% water so being kind to others quite literally changes them."

It’s caused by hormonal bathes in the womb where there’s either too much testosterone or too little put out, which is what develops a childs genitalia. The child’s brain forms before it’s genitalia, so the mother’s body is meant to recognise the brains gender so it can send out the right amount of hormones. Sometimes this is messed up, which causes someone to be trans. Go do some actual research and not some biased looking at one video where it’s extremely political.

Of course it’s not normal, it’s an illness can you believe that? It’s when that you’re in the womb and your mums body goes oopsie not enough testosterone or too much testosterone and it doesn’t match your brain, which is formed before genitalia and actually has gender defining characteristics. That’s why we transition, to make our lives easier. It never completely goes away, but it gets a hell of a lot better. And guess what, you go to therapy to get diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is basically the only requirement for being transgender. So uhhh you’re right but in the wrong way"
insaneparents,fqcy3im,t1_fqb8uxk,1589272919.0,"Oh my god that’s just fucked up man. From my experiences most religions have some weird ass standards for what’s considered right and wrong. Like I’m Wiccan and our biggest thing is “An it harm none, do what ye will” which is basically just if it harms nobody or nothing, you have the freedom to do it as it’s not negative in nature. That’s pretty much the whole basis for it. Cause and effect and harming none. Some things are just wack tho"

insaneparents,fqcxsiz,t1_fqb3r52,1589272614.0,"As a minor who’s somewhat realised that my parents are messed up, still kind of refusing to acknowledge they might be abusive, I’m genuinely hoping I’ll be able to change this and actually become a good parent if I choose to have kids. As of right now, I don’t feel comfortable doing so because I won’t cause any pain towards others, I’ll just have dogs and cats and birds and rabbits and pigs"
insaneparents,fqcxnvr,t1_fqa8emr,1589272487.0,"Lmao I wish I would be able to go to a mental hospital man. Not a bad one, obviously, but a decent one. My mental state is shit. I quite literally can’t function and I’ll go into catatonia way too often as well as just hallucinations and general fucking depression with some C-PTSD thrown in there too. I genuinely need to like make sure I can’t kill myself since I’m like this close"

insaneparents,fqcxdmm,t1_fqbdfl3,1589272202.0,"There’s a difference between helping and actually working. Helping is spending some time to do something to benefit everyone because we all do our fair share. Working is doing something that’s hard labour and takes up a lot of time and energy, as well as typically doing it either on your own or with someone else who is just doing something else speeding up the process, but not making your load any easier. That’s work, and that should be paid for. You wouldn’t expect a plumber to just do work and not get paid because you know them or they’re family. You would still pay them because they put in work. If it’s immediate family, then yeah sometimes if it’s a voluntary thing then yeah that’s helping out. But employing someone else to do something is work and that shouldn’t just come free or with having a child. Children have just as much right to all aspects of life as anyone else, sure the quarantine is messing with everyone but their pay doesn’t even have to be money, it could be extra video game time or something to show that work pays and then they’ll learn to manage money or currency for that matter. Children are just as entitled to all aspects of life except for complete independence as they just don’t know how the world works completely yet. However, they are just as human as anyone else here."

insaneparents,fqcwqxv,t3_ghnqdr,1589271572.0,"Haha I feel this. Went to the hospital for self harm, not like it needed physical attention my mental was just down the drain and I was in severe catatonia and I could barely process things around me. But like ya know I just wanted attention. And totally not like the doctors just said that he’s fine and I should just go home and take a bath and read a book and then I’ll feel better. Haha noooo. Totally not like I’ve been seriously contemplating suicide for the past like week or so haha totally not like just debating if it’s worth staying alive for my dogs or not. Hahaha"

CPTSD,fq5jslr,t1_fq30t9u,1589108104.0,"I can totally see that but my mum would always scream at me to forgive and blah blah blah all that shit to gaslight you and make you feel bad blah blah blah. And because of that shit I’ve practically also refused to ever forgive them. The pain I’m in and was in thanks to them doesn’t ever deserve forgiveness. I wish they were dead so no one would be hurt by them again. I will never forgive them for what they did to me. It still ducking hurts, it feels like it always will and they don’t deserve me to forgive them at all. Ill always hate them and I’ll always hold that hatred. I was always told to forgive and now I refuse to. I have a right to not forgive and I was never given that so now I’m giving it to myself"
