genderqueer,fqbxruu,t1_fqbgz2y,1589246030.0,"Yeah, that’s what I’m concerned about definitely. As I said, I place way more value on my appearance than I should so changing it in an uncontrolled manner is really scary to me though I also know I’m completely and utterly miserable living as a girl to a really extreme degree so I keep flopping back and forth between how I feel about it. 
I’m thinking about waiting until after surgeries (top surgery in about 6 months, hopefully body sculpting at some point) and see if I’m satisfied with surgery but I’m also concerned that my current body will get worse in that time period  if its being estrogen-fueled, so to speak. 

Birth control definitely isn’t an option for me though, the idea of taking it makes me really dysphoric unfortunately. 

Ultimately I guess I’m just really distressed because unpredictable changes are honestly a scary thing to go through even when you want them but living the way I am now doesn’t feel like an option either."

I honestly don’t even know what to talk about or how to. Its just so hard and it feels so crushing and overwhelming. Its such a heavy choice to either choose something completely life changing and unpredictable or to be miserable and stuck until I die. I’ve been in awful situations before but situations can be escaped but I can’t run away from my own body."
EDanonymemes,folrbcs,t1_fol2c1z,1587868644.0,"Unfortunately there is no surgery to reduce hip size at all, top surgery would be to create a flat and more masculine chest. Hips and thighs are just the absolute worst when you’re trans because there’s so little to be done about it. 😔 I’m definitely trying to not restrict again though because I need to be at a safe weight for the anesthesia when surgery comes around."

HollowKnightMemes,fjnpkdj,t1_fjn6u57,1583512084.0,"Yeah! I think its pretty much /Very/ Likely that it’s gonna be set after the events of the Embrace the Void ending, considering the framing as a cliffhanger.

I kinda feel doubtful that we would meet the Hollow Knight /in/ Pharloom because I feel doubtful that they’d just up and leave Hallownest on their own or be in a state to do so but I do hope we get answers about what the heck that little cutscene was. I definitely agree with you about it probably not being a fight, she got into a fighting stance but I don’t even know if the Hollow Knight would be in a physical state to fight either after all that. I really want them to get a chance to be happy though. :’)"
