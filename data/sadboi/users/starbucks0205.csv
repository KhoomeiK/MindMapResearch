(and believe Me I double-checked by searching the place of the mall and lo and behold it existed and still looks exactly the same as I remembered) Basically what I’m trying to say is, maybe it wasn’t sex trafficking, but the sexual abuse did happen just in a way that makes more sense but can’t be uncovered yet cuz the Brian is confusing.

As for your first question yes and no. Some ppl who feel interested will generally stray closer to the front but we don’t always keep a close eye because it is no longer required of us to do so. 
we only ever take charge if the core appears to be in distress .  It’s kinda like sitting in another room from the front. If they need help, help but other than that we just mind our own business.
-16

Great now that 16 has successfully answered the first half well, in all honesty there are ways to block ppl off but generally it’s really not within my control. It’s  done instinctively and most of the time is like breathing you just do it naturally its only when you start focusing on your breathing do you start to get into trouble. So to keep it short there are ways to block ppl off but they are done so naturally I and the others barely even realise we do it. We just do it. 
-core

As for co-conning, In the beginning, co-conscious with the core was a difficult feat for us. This is because communication was not exactly the best for us especially since many had held feelings of resentment for our core. Generally the experience varies. I and my core both share joint control over the body. While others like Nat can only take over certain parts of the body itself. However while fighting is still a common place no longer is it as serious as it used to be if borders a lot more on playful roughhousing. And yes, occasionally one might have to compromise and give control it generally ends quite peacefully. Likely due to our better communication, we mostly function quite seamlessly regardless of who is co-conscious with the core. 
And getting things done are the same as how you who I presume to be a normal person gets things down. Yes it’s a little more complicated but I Assure that such things get better with time. How’s from what I have observed with other members who are co-conscious we barely experience any delays save of the occasional squabble and banter. My apologies, I am not quite sure what the aim of your question is, hence the slight, rambling. But I do believe It has answered your question yes? 
Sincerely,
16"
AMA,f8a6mqe,t1_f89qti6,1574389120.0,"one of the ways to heal  that don’t involve intergration is trauma processing and building trust and communication within the system and me the core. 
This is because one of the main distressing things bout DID is teh effects of trauma eg: flashbacks, disassociation, triggers. And the forced switching by alters who are weary and do not trust the situation to be handled accordingly. 
In addition to all the fighting.  
Which is why trauma processing is important as it helps to manage disassociation, and deal with triggers or flashbacks as it gives the  individual  skills to handle such events. 

For example when I was having a flashback that I was 6 again, I grounded myself or prevented the flashbacks from getting any worse was by standing next to a really tall object and constantly reminding myself that a 6 year old wouldn’t be able to be that tall. 
It’s things like that, that can make all the difference. 
Trauma processing also  makes getting triggering less intense so even when I get triggered, I am able to walk it off as my Brain as more or less recognised that welp, that shit be over. Disassociation also gets less intense so i am more likely to remember certain events however vaguely which is a great improvement for me as my form of disassociation comes in teh form of complete black outs. So joy. 

Communication is also important as it helps to trauma processing and make living better as alters will be more willing to help eg if I forget something due to disassociation somebody who was near the front could relay the info to me. 
It also reduces fighting and time lost by forced switches.  Because we all have a better understanding off each other and are more likely to trust each other to handle things accordingly even if we may not always agree on how it is handled. So yeah, there are many ways to heal that doesn’t need intergration. -core"

Tbh it’s hard to form outside relationships if you don’t  front that often as such things require time that we don’t  have.  Not that it’s. A bad thing, it’s a must have especially for a system as large as we are. Most of us aren’t even that bothered by that fact. Why should we care?

And yes we do hold contradictory beliefs. Like religion Some of us view religion as a good thing while others like me the core have complicated feelings towards it. Not to say I hate it, but it’s complicated.

Yes. We all also have different habits. Aqua used to drink a lot. But recently she’s been trying to wane off her addiction I am very proud of her for that. And there are others who are well know for their compulsive cleaning while I .. ai just like to make a mess. Idk why I just generally am a very messy person. Others liek Aasil just love to garden. Or others like Akira are really Into woodwork or cutting objects into specific shapes. He even has a mini knife collection. And dewdrop has a mini gemstone collection and a book about precious stones. so yeh we all have different habits. Why would we not?

As for how we found out well uh, truth be told, unlike most system our inter-communication has always been very good,so we’ve always been aware of our large number. Because we see each other in the headspace every day. Sure some may be less well known to the majority, eg ppl like autumn who are so far Into the head space ppl barely knew she existed except for ice.

Hmm maybe? I can’t say for the others but I’m pretty content to say we more or less have everyone it’s been 2 months and there haven’t been anymore strays 
(ppl who have neglected to come to the front ) so ehh. But who knows? sides, it’s always nice meeting old friends! 😁(also lol sorry for the weird language me and the core at like Co-conning right now 😂) 
-dewdrop 💦

Ps: co-conning is a term where both both alters are sharing the front. Dew is here cuz some of teh questions are alter-related. That and she likes to meet new ppl. 
-core


Hmmm well let’s see, for me I simply developed over time! The core has really terrible social skills so in a way I was there to help them, eventually they picked up my skills by learning form me and viola! 
I was forming when the core was 6 cuz they needed help with school mates cuz well, they were extremely weary of ppl for good reason too! But still, really weary 😅! 
Anyways back to topic, it varies for us. Because our system is so large, some of us liek 16! Who spilt from a certain incident not gonna go into details but it was pretty scary. While alters like me or Aqua are spilt but developed over time. 
To put it simply, for those who spilt form certain incidents, it’s kinda like putting growth hormones into a chicken!😁
While those who develop overtime are like the ones who go thru a natural lifecycle of growing. Both are completely valid tho!😁
Let’s see for the whole appearing thing, that’s a reeaaally strange question you see, it’s hard to remember the details for how I got here. 
If I take a Guess towards your statement, I’d say maybe? 
But from what I remember, it’s like like bring in a warm, dark and fluid-covered place.  
where occasionally I get to experience the outside and grow. Until eventually the darkness fades and suddenly there’s a bright light aaaannd I’m here! In the core’s mind! prrreetty strange huh? But as I have said before, experiences vary because for those who are formed and develop quickly it’s literally like flying through a void at high speed before a bright light appears(at least that’s what 16 told me) I don’t know OP it’s hard to tell your question it’s not one that’s easy to answer 😅 not in a bad way of course but still 😅.
Hope you still found this satisfactory tho!😁
-Dewdrop 💦

Also, it’s alright, you haven’t offended any off us in any way you were respectful to us so I dotn see a reason why we should be upset. 
As for certain things to watch for, well, ppl with DID are extremely weary ppl, 
so sometimes if you suspect a switch but they don’t come forward sometimes it’s best to play along and pretend nothing happened that is unless you are extremely familiar with the system. 
Or if they just told you specifically that it is alright but even then, it’s still hard because what one person/alter says is not always agreed upon by another.
So it’s best to try and be respectful.  
Another thing is disassociation, sometimes it can take the from of being the blurrest person alive so it could really help (at least in my experience) if you explain things in lots of details because when disassociated, your Brain doesn’t see or connect dots as quickly as it should. For my system, (and from what I’ve seen, from most systems) we just address me the core or whichever alter is playing the role of host. 
This is because  referring you guys as a whole can trigger ppl to front when they didn’t want to and also make the body really tired. 
So unless it is explicitly stated here in the replies that we are co-conning or someone switched out to answer these questions. Just assume you’re speaking to me, the core. 

Also I like to  say that one common misconception is that ppl confuse the role of host as automatically being the original. you referred to my friends as them appearing in the “host’s mind” that is not correct. The more accurate term is “core’s mind” 
This is because Host is simply just a role that handles daily living.
eg: going to school, homework etc etc.  It’s a role that any alter who is fit can play. Which is why some systems have more then one host. 
Core on the other hand, is the original. It is what ppl dub as the original. It is actually the one ppl refer to when Asking bout the body in general not the host. As host is literally just a role that anyone can play. It just so happens that I am best suited to it. So I am both core and host. Does that make sense? Also I hope that answers your questions!"

Also the ironic thing bout these supposed “systems” is if they were a real system and pulled all that shut aka openly being like oh this one is so edgy or gods forbid posting a vid bout a sad and vulnerable little which in my opinion is the most telltale sign of a faker cuz like who in the right mind would let the whole World see a crying young kid probably 3-5 yrs on the internet. much less a crying traumatised  kid crying on The internet?? Which is arguably more easily manipulated and vulnerable to harm and self-destructive behaviours than your average toddler or child. 
Like bruh teh internet is a dangerous place y’all. The last thing you want is for ppl to take advantage of a CHILD by letting the world world see how vulnerable they are it’s like literally holding up a sign going manipulate me please! like seriously what is the rationale?? 

But anyways as I was saying, if they were an actual system,  they would be so fucked none of them would trust each other and would probably hate each other more considering how often  these ppl like to make vids bout how these alters presumably hating each other and actually acting out it out. 
Not even counting the public system rants which would further decrease overall inter-system trust and communication and increase aggression cuz they’re gonna get angry for the breach in privacy plus not even gonna trust the host or whoever posted as the posters have made it clear nothing can make them shut their mouths. Making other alters angry and shut their mouths. 

Like seriously It  took me months to convince my system that it was safe enough for ME and only ME to post anything online without their consent and multiple checks. And paranoids others taking it all down before reposting only to take it down once more. Mind you most of the stuff wasn’t even remotely relating to trauma or systems in general. they were just that cautious. Like seriously who are these ppl trying to fool??

And I agree excluding trauma (I’ll get to that later) having to work with ppl who have blocked you from having success or what is best for everyone can be extremely frustrating and unfair. In addition with the very reasonable fear of having to process shit that will further endanger your lifestyle. I understand why you do the things you do. However that being said, have you considered that, maybe having  all that repressed pain may actually affecting your life? You may have no conscious have memories or feelings but just because you don’t remember doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. I’m not saying dealing with that pain won’t give you trouble it will. It will give you a lot of trouble. But it is also vital for you to heal and I can guarantee will improve your overall functionality. In addition I understand that you may not feel comfortable letting your system speak but as I said if you truly want to improve and catch up your lifestyle, you will have to. as if you don’t, they will continue to get in the way in attempt to make their voices and needs heard. And some might even take it to extreme that could endanger your body. And you, will have to deal with your Brain constantly freaking out overseemingly normal things which all in all does not sound like a fun or productive life to me. I understand not feeling like it’s the right time but, unfortunately, truma and healing never has a right time. You just have to grit your teeth and do it. It will be difficult. Healing is very difficult. But I promise you it will be worth it. However that being said, I understand your worries and your struggles.

Because There are many ways to host. Because the Host is basically the alter that handles daily living  aka how a singlet would live their life going to school, working , getting a job etc etc. However, that doesn’t mean there cannot be more than one host because like I said, a job as host is to do well, normal ppl stuff. And sometimes systems require that extra pair of hands. Sometimes meaning not every system has 2 or more hosts. Others can only have 1. Either way, When then there is more then one host, we call that host and co-Host. Yeh. 
There are also  times when alters who used to Host now for whatever reason can’t or won’t want to be host anymore and the role just kinda switches to a more capable and willing alter. And when then happens the alter is referred to as ex or old host and new alter taking the job as well, host. Because hosting like I said,  is literally just a role to be fulfilled. Like how a system has roles of protecter and caretaker. Host is also just another role within the system. That is just as helpful and required

It’s literally a voice replying back for me at least. With the same thing happening for alters in my system as well. Like we literally sit down and talk. With no intrusive thoughts or anything just literally talking.  Of course such a thing took a a lot of time but it’s still possible so ehh. And not all systems work like that but so maybe that’s just us. But Its still a thing so eh . Hope you find that helpful. We’ll also be really happy to answer any questions as well.

DID,f26g56k,t3_dc23p1,1570008547.0,"Ours is just a big grey building surrounded by a forest, swamps, floating crystal platforms. Etc etc We all have our own rooms for each alter. But Some doors do lead to specific places such as one door leading to a costal town or another just depositing you in an underwater abandoned City. Or another leading to a open field. Or a workplace for the other half of the system but that’s like hardly counts as a room. But we do have a main area which consist of a large ass kitchen and some sofas and a tv which will occasionally turn into a screen which we can view what the body sees. Even the core/host has their own room which is connected to  the fronting chair. But it changes everyday depending on their needs/mood so there isn’t much to say about it. Only that ppl can enter at will but can’t always use the fronting chair to front. Or sometimes you need access by the host to enter their room cuz you know permission and privacy but we all have that shit so eh. And From what I know, the host hangs out there a lot and can occasionally enter the inner world at will when they aren’t busy cuz I often see them hanging around the garden (another specific room) or chilling by the main area. Or joining us for camping but that’s a recent shit they could do  so yeh. Can any other hosts enter the inner world at will? I’m honestly kinda curious. Cuz ours couldn’t do it but eventually could after we improved communication. But yeh that’s ours. Oh and before I forget we have a mini courtyard where we either stargaze, camp or throw mini barbecues. So yeh that’s us. Yay

And in turn reducing switch to Albe to function more effectively.  Using apps such as mystagram and self-talking also helped to build communication which helped a lot.

DID,eybrjgi,t3_cweikr,1566990467.0,"One of the things we struggled with was pressure for communication with everyone and for everyone to communicate with the host. You see there’s always smaller systems out there that are Able to do those  kind of things that alters have to learn to be idk exclusively out or something, but as an alter and the main protector of this system, I advice you to not worry about not having communication for very single alter and to personally know everyone. A poly system is very different from smaller systems Due to the vast amount of us there are. Instead focus on building trust and respect between you and your alters, yes communication is important but when the system as a whole trust you to do what’s right it makes Everyday functioning and getting along as a whole much easier for all of us even if you the host don’t personally know certain alters and they don’t personally know you as there won’t be ppl pushing their way to the front out of fear that something won’t be done right or overriding your or the majorities choices. This trust and respect can be built by showing that you the host take them and their fears seriously and showing responsibility in Everyday task such as making sure you are on time for errands or even small things like making sure that the body eats or even doing work in like the hardworking way. Of course this is all the advice I have to give and good luck all of you on your journey ! take care!

“Don’t believe internet tests”

Ok first off yes, I agree with the statement that you shouldn’t believe online tests as such things aren’t always accurate. But you do not have the qualifications to tell someone to disregard a professional’s advice unless you happen to be one yourself. Which I highly doubt cuz no professional in the mental health industry worth their salt will say such such ashine things. However, I do not believe you are a  bad person as I  do understand where you are coming from and I do not know you in person so it will be wrong to assume. 

“If you look your self bipolar, your brain will automatically assume that you are bipolar. “


But I kindly advise that you reframe your thinking towards mental illness as mental illness does NOT include your brain assuming things. 
It doesn’t matter how many times you assume. Unless you are actually mentally ill none of those assumptions will yield any permanent affects. There is a reason why ppl who romantise mental illness despite all their twisted admiration and longing for said illnesses never actually have it. Your statement is the very reason why there is still such a high stigma against it and is still not taken seriously by the general population. 
Mental illness does NOT come about with the Brain assuming things and acting accordingly.  
if it were that simple, everyone who wrongly assumed they had a mental illness would have it and the rates for mental illness will be much, much higher. 
Because with this day and age everyone thinks they have a mental illness regardless if they are actually right or not. 
In fact, there is actual scientific evidence to support this statement that mental illness is not caused by a placebo effect. 
Which I highly suggest you look up. 

“Consult a psychiatrist but don’t take any medication even if they recommend one.”

Secondly is this, medication is often also part of a vital part of recovery and management of symptoms. When someone is mentally ill  not only are they psychologically struggling, their body is also experiencing a chemical imbalance that can either further worsen symptoms or worst case scenario can actually lend them in a Long term care facility thanks to said chemical imbalance beginning to affect or worst case scenario, even permanently change how their brain processes things . How I do know this? I have an aunt who landed in a Long term mental care facility because she refused to take her meds out of her fear and the incorrect assumption that it was her medication that was causing it. And to paint you a better picture she’s been there for the past 20 years. So hip hip horray for a lack of education and stigma right? 


To end this all off, I would like to reiterate that I do not think you are a bad person and I apologise if you felt threatened or felt like I was shaming you as that was not my intention. I am simply trying to educate/ tell you that mental illnesses are not as black and white as the general population thinks it is. 
The reason I am so harsh on you is because the stigma is exactly prevalent and 
it affects many ppl who are struggling with said mental illnesses and having ppl assume it is that easy to recover or get a mental illness is not helping. And as someone who also struggles from a mental illness just as rare and as controversial as bipolar . I take high offense to that as I can tell you my condition had been a part of me Long before I had been diagnosed and will be even if I hadn’t. And I can also tell you that this misconception you are harbouring does not make my life or anybody else with a mental illness any easier. 

Good day to you and I hope this helps. 
Take care."

Even if he does creep me out sometimes 😅he’s kinda like a mechanical clown with a mix of coralline’s other Mother . Truth be told he’s huge and he’s kinda awesome looking! I wanna draw him someday but I’ve got no time 😅. I like him. Also same!  I haven’t heard of anyone else having someone like joker so it’s nice to see someone similar around !
DIDart,ewrm3yy,t3_coqnbg,1565708670.0,Holy shit dude that’d amazing also I can’t believe I’m saying this but he looks really similar to an alter in our system called joker! Like seriously! He even has the hanging chains and clowns theme and all! Also nice work! Your art is great!
DID,ewrlwti,t1_ewrgog9,1565708538.0,I see thank you very much! But how did you do it? If you don’t mind me asking? Like did you slowly cut contact or did you up and leave?
DID,ewrlhjk,t1_ewrg13q,1565708261.0,"Hey  it’s cool I know  how it is. You’re in a very similar fucking situation I was used to be in. So I thought you could use a hand. It’s chill. The others used to ignore me a lot hell. ( they still  do but some have gotten around) it got so bad they eventually just locked me away along with the other prosecutors until the host came along/ found out and kicked sense into them to let us prosecutors go. Unfortunately for you it doesn’t seem like your host will pull that shit so here’s my advice. The rest of system they’re all emotional pieces of shits who don’t really think clearly and are paranoid as fuck. if you wanna know  how I figured it out well I’m honestly ashamed to admit this but it was once again the host who figured that out that helped me to get along with the others by copying that shit. But like I said it doesn’t sound  like your host is gonna pull that shit. So If you wanna get someone to listen to you / stop treating you like shit, know this: They probably avoid you cuz they think you’re dangerous as fuck. And cuz they think you’re a dangerous shit well, I already said they are probably paranoid as fuck didn’t I? And judging by the way you fucking talk you probably are dangerous as fuck. Idk who and what you’re like or how the fuck you even behave, but I hope that shit helps. Cuz that sure as hell helped me. Best of luck to ya Alex. It is was.... nice talking to you and... I’m Glad whatever I said made ya feel just a little better.

Edit: That being said, it’s also up to the others to be more accepting of you if ya try your fucking hardest screw it and just do your best at whatever job you do in your fucking system . Or a find a hobby you can do In the Inner space whatever works with you. But if they ever come around, you can shit on them for a bit, hell you can even stab them, I mean that’s what I did.  But.. don’t let it stop you from knowing them and them knowing you. Cuz trust me no matter how unreasonable they are and no matter how unreasonable your host is at times, trust me when I say they’re aren’t that bad. That and remember that you’re just as an unreasonable shit as they are. So y’all can be unreasonable together. Welp, Thats it for me I’m hopefully gonna end it here bleh never have I sprouted this much philosophical shit. See ya around Alex."
DID,ewrftl6,t3_cpsnei,1565704374.0,"Listen if you’re having this much fucking trouble with your fam you should suck the fuck up and talk to the host to get freedom or at least compromise on something cuz Guess what ? that dipshit is gonna be stuck with ya and the 2 of you have to suck it up and compromise. Not saying that you’re in the wrong but you have to try and reach for something instead of being angry and bottling it all up. Cuz the rest can’t read your mind. They aren’t right but if you want shit to get better you have to try and make them understand.  As an alter and the prosecutor  of my  system (I ain’t stating my name cuz frankly I don’t trust your unstable ass right now.) I get shit on a lot and one thing I can  tell ya is that the best thing you can do is try to talk to someone doesn’t even have to answer the host cuz if someone is on your side it’s bearable. 
Second yeah being an alter fucking sucks ya don’t get your own life , ya don’t even get your own fucking face and the off chance you’re out would end up being to clean after an alter or having put up with host daily ass activities. But it’s worth it trust me it is shit but it is worth it I can’t explain it but it is. 
. But it gets better so just hang in there ya hear? 

Best of luck to your sorry ass cuz you sound like ya in a shit ton of trouble both externally and internally."

DID,ewkv1za,t3_cnw1na,1565495493.0,Yo guys I just found something called selftalking. It literally lets you talk to yourself in chat format meaning alters can communicate like in a WhatsApp chat without it being way to intrusive. It’s pretty looks pretty useful.
DID,ewj4doa,t3_coeuk5,1565461158.0,"For splitting the best way to do it is learning grounding techniques and crisis skills. 
As for rapid switching and communication we usually have clear short term goals so that way everyone is more or less on board with each other so less switching. 

Also try to build like a communal board in the inner world so any goal that is there for the day should be stuck on the board. 
That way it will help for those not out but close enough to want to know and stop them from interfering with the host or panicking due to the lack of info.

Frequent internal communication is also very very important so y’all better learn to work to together and compromise cuz if you’re a large system most of the time you ain’t gonna be Able to get the body to yourself for your own needs and purposes so get used to passive influence and compromise .😂 
Don’t worry guys to really not all that bad it’s actually quite fun!😁
( also host I can see that look don’t worry mate we ain’t suffering we are very content with our lives don’t worry) 
Anyways, don’t worry to much about host to alter communication so like try not to worry too much/ feel to bad about personal face to face talks. Like that’s important but you should focus more on building trust and respect. 
Cuz (for host) if you’re a polyfrag face to face is hard and near impossible to attempt so treat the rest of us except the really close ones that you see frequently as your penpal or online friend you see regularlyish. 
but you still trust and respect and accept plus support each other!😁😋 
Another thing for communication is to build 
a mural and general respect and trust. 
This can be helped by the host treating and taking care of the body and showing responsibility in their goals and chores for the day. This is important as it helps more distant alters feel assured that they will be safe and that the host can handle themselves or themself and that the body in general will be safe and that they can trust the host to get things done. 
Which will / might improve general system anxiety, mood and the buzzing cause communication will be better cuz if there is a problem more alters will be willing to be open about it for help. Cuz y’know trust.

Alters can also help by being respectful and gentle with each other and the host 
( especially the host also just try not to overwork that’s a problem our host has an issue with) 

Another thing for communication is, 
we also like to keep like a mini chat group on the host/ cores phone which we use to communicate to each and to the host we even have our own individual groups if we ever need to use it. 
So that’s about it for us hope it helps!

Also almost forgot! try to keep list of everybody’s name and the roles and type of alters in the system or systems! It’s really helps! 
The buzzing should go away after communication gets better but if not the host either likes to sleep to shut us out or play music sometimes we really do talk to much we can’t help it😅 sorry host we really love you mate we do . 

Anyways that’s about it for us folks!( or until we think of something new or remember something) so we/I hope this helps and best of luck OPs!😁
