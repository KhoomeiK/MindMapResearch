Deep down I know this wont solve anything, and the chances of these outcomes are slim, but I cant help it and continue to fantasize anyways."

gaming,fahb1pl,t3_c1bwle,1576082759.0,"I was going to say Soma as well, but second on my list was Metro 2033. Resources are very limited and fending off monsters is tough. Too many stealth levels which took ages to get to the end of each level. 

With that being said, beating the game still felt really great and I felt accomplished. But I definitely thought I wont be coming back to it anytime soon and a big nope when I saw the trailer to the new Metro coming up."

Hmm..maybe..the game you mentioned \*\*do\*\* have some insects flying here and there, and it looks like you have ample spaces flying around. But I remember the game OP mentioned is infested with all kinds of bugs."

Asking him for advice is just extra/optional work that's stressful itself. My experience tells me that I should ask him for it only if I truly don't have any other alternatives. He avoids the topic of my suicidal thoughts like the plague with the same ""Life is Hell and if you kill yourself you'll have to relive the exact same life all over again without your memories"".

Apology for the rant."
