polyamory,fjhi1wy,t3_fdghoi,1583348519.0,">So I was just curious if there's anyone out there who has felt the same, but managed to do a full 180 and become a polyamorous person. 

Yup. My nesting partner and I did that. Monogamous for over a decade and now she's got other partners. I'm currently not in any other romantic relationships, but am happy to use the ""poly"" label. 


>And if so, how long did it take to make this transition?

We did lots of reading and discussion for 2-3 months, and then her first non-mono partner asked her out ðŸ˜‚.

I think it's important to know that *feeling* jealousy is completely natural. It just depends what you *do* based on that.

For my NP and I, it took a lot of vulnerable, difficult conversations to get a better sense of what we both wanted out of opening up the marriage. I feel like we're way better communicators with each other now, and have a deeper understanding that seeing other people doesn't mean that love for each other is diminished. But that it's also on the table to inform the other person if that's perceived to be happening!

A lot of the initial transition is, imo, learning not to take your current partner for granted, learning how to express your fears/wants/needs constructively and to allow your partner to do the same."

A majority of my friends are white, which I think I specifically tried to achieve back in high school because I didn't fit in with 1st gen kids, or kids born in HK for example.

Now, as an adult, I find myself wanting more non-white friends as I sometimes want to rant about white people to someone who will get it! I hate having to explain to even my close friends for the 50000th time the difference between Cantonese and Mandarin, for instance. I hate going to whitewashed Chinese restaurants because the good ones are too real for my white friends. I like having those similar cultural touchstones where you don't feel like you have to explain ""your culture"" to give context. 


Seriously though, for the most part, I do feel that certain values, norms, and tastes are quite different even with 1st Gen Asian people, and it's hard for me to connect. I am pretty counter-culture which I don't find much of with other Asians. I've found more success in making Asian friends who are in the LGBT community, as I find they are much more willing to challenge traditions and have experience navigating different worlds."

travel,fdizqou,t3_eliac1,1578454808.0,"- I did the Machu Picchu Monuntain hike (not Huayna Picchu, the short, steep, ""stairs of death"" one) and it was amazing. The archaeological site looks tiny, and you can watch the clouds come and go, revealing the site in a pretty magical way. It was about 3-4 hours round trip I think. You need to book in advance, as they have limited tickets per day. They're also very strict about entrance time (the official at the gate turned a guy away who was 10 min late for his ""departure time"" even though there was clearly enough room on the trail for him... there were only maybe 20 of us at this departure time). 

 There are a couple of sections where you are pretty close to a cliff edge, but it's not as death defying as Huayna Picchu. And less crowded.

- I did PeruHop and enjoyed it as a first-timer to Peru. It feels a bit like a bus tour (because well... it basically is), so if you're vehemently against that, then it won't be for you. It is really convenient though, and you get to meet other travelers more easily. 
Bus is pretty comfortable, and they take care of the connections for you. That is really handy. 

 I did the Lima -> Cusco route without the stop at Lake Titicaca, and here are some quick thoughts (in reverse, from Cusco - Lima, for your interests):
- Arequipa is a busy, colonial-type city. The picanterias (restaurants that specialize in one-plate meals) are heralded, but IMO the food was super heavy and not incredibly varied. We stayed 2-3 days and thought it was nice enough, but felt okay leaving after that.
- Nazca stop was cool, the scenery in that area is unreal, but it really is just a leg-stretch stop.
- Huacachina is a bit of a tourist trap, but the dunebuggy + sandboarding tour was super fun, definitely a highlight of the trip. We had a driver that was completely insane and drifted the buggy towards other buggies and took us to sand dunes that were crazy high and no one else went to. Amazing landscape in the desert there. 
The town itself is clearly based around tourism to the sand dunes, and apparently water and electricity cutting out/running out is ""normal."" Happened to us one night.
- Paracas stop was also nice. The boat tour to the island was interesting, and the landscape into the reserve was beautiful. I'm also into birds so there's that.

- I actually liked Lima. It's not super geared towards tourists, but that's sort of the point. It's a city where people live and work in, and it's more about hanging out than having these amazing museums and tourist sites. If you surf, that seems very popular there!"

martialarts,f6xyb32,t1_f6wa0bt,1573262108.0,"Judo is pretty ripen for concussions when randori or tournaments come into the equation. Even though you are taught how to break fall, the probability of getting a concussion is still way higher than in BJJ just because of the nature of it (primarily standing and throwing, vs groundwork).

Assuming you don't want to compete, going to a boxing or muay Thai gym where you aren't expected to spar would be fine for avoiding concussions. Just doing pad work and bag work and that kinda stuff is fine."
AskReddit,f6xts4u,t1_f6xa9vx,1573258312.0,"But some ""string"" (like butcher string) seems to be make of smaller threads. Is it technically rope then?"
AskReddit,f6xa2z8,t3_dtlex3,1573245468.0,"My partner's bleary ponderings early in the morning:

Rope, from what I can tell, is a braided or somehow bound collection of thread. String can be similarly constructed (E.g. Twine, yarn, butcher strings, guitar strings).

So, at what point (gauge, material, etc) does one use the word ""rope"" vs ""string?"""
Anxiety,f6wuipg,t3_dtd0fi,1573235165.0,"I hear you. I feel exactly like this on my unstructured days off/weekends esp if my (few) friends or partner are busy doing things without me. And then when I see them I feel guilty and anxious about being an emotionally needy person...

Could I give some advice that has helped me? 
Try setting up a calendar or bullet journal of tasks you do/could do for each day. You could do this day-by-day in the morning, or in the evening of the previous day (what I do). Just listing out some things you could get done/accomplish in the next 24-48 hrs. Even things like ""Take out recycling,"" or ""Walk for 30 min"" or ""Go to the library."" if you're seeking employment, you could schedule meetings with a free vocational counsellor or schedule time to work on job applications or something. 
I found that this was pretty helpful in getting me to see what sort of things I *do* do, and helped me feel less like human detritus. It also puts some pressure to get you to do the thing you wrote down, as it's now a ""To do"" item. It's on paper, less just in your head, which is where lots of us anxious people get trapped... In the ideas and feelings surrounding things and not directed at the act of doing it."

vancouver,f5x2bze,t3_dp20z0,1572534321.0,"Born and raised Vancouverite here.

I love this city, even with all its flaws. The almost perfect ratio of mountains, green space, waterfront, and urban living are hard to find in other Canadian cities. We have real parks that have trails and trees and landscape features, not just a tract of grass. There's all sorts of great food here too. Many neighbourhoods are safe and enjoyable to walk through. 

I'm not much into clubs and bars, so I can't comment on that. My own bias, and from what I've heard from other out-of-towners--is that Vancouver is more about low key socializing at a friend's place or over cocktails and craft beer, rather than late night parties. 
Also, if you live in Vancouver proper (not any of the suburbs), you don't really need to own a car, which saves on expenses. There are ways to get to the mountains and all that good stuff without owning a car - others have chimed in already about that. 

It does rain a lot, I'll give you that. 

Sorry to hear you're having a hard time adjusting. I think if you give it some time and start to figure out the flow of Vancouver, you can grow to appreciate it."
