Drugs,fq3un5a,t1_fpzur7x,1589070478.0,"Trust me. You‚Äôre not. I went through the same thing a year ago... smoked way too much, had a massive panic attack, heart rate went up to 160 which doesn‚Äôt sounds crazy but to me it was terrifying. Called the ambulance, they came and told me I was fine but ohhh man was I not! I had severe panic attacks for the rest of the week, thought I was going crazy, couldn‚Äôt be alone, couldn‚Äôt focus. It was horrific but it‚Äôs not YOU! It‚Äôs the anxiety. And trust me, it will pass. I went to a therapist who saved me ... and I highly recommend professional help but everyone is different.

It‚Äôs insane because I used to smoke week every day when I was younger ....anyways, just know you will be ok and you‚Äôre not crazy - AT ALL ‚ô•Ô∏è"

The occasional meat joke or vegan joke is thrown out there but honestly, I let that slide off my back. Course, I try and educate at times and that can go either way. But regardless, I choose this lifestyle for many reasons and I‚Äôm not willing to change that because of other people‚Äôs opinions. I understand I will have to work with dairy cows and other animals used in the food industry but as I read previously from another vet student whose vegan, yes it will be extremely difficult but imagine coming out of Vet school and being able to help so many animals. To educate people about those industries and being apart of the movement towards veganism. Don‚Äôt ever change your dreams because you choose to live a certain lifestyle that is GOOD for this planet. Be who you are. Always."
