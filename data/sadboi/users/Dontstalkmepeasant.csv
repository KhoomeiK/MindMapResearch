porninfifteenseconds,fpcxtuy,t1_ffizyuy,1588515434.0,"Squirter here. I've been dehydrated and used the washroom right before being aroused (I really tried to make sure that my bladder is empty) and still squirted a considerable amount. 

It is watery, colorless, probably acidic, probably odorless (not sure because I think it mixes with the thicker secretions from the Skene's glands) but usually doesn't smell like pee (sometimes, but only faintly). 

It probably comes out of the urethra and uses the fluid in the bladder (it makes sense that there's no other organ to hold large amounts of fluid), but it cannot be called ""pee"". It is very likely that they are chemically different. It may have some pee mixed with it though because they both come out through the urethra/bladder)

Obviously, I haven't done scientific research, only my hypothesis based on observation. So you cannot refute that it isn't pee. Also, no uterus, no opinion."

depression,ff76ich,t1_ff5szi4,1579642086.0,That's a very good analogy! Thank you! I find that most people even fail to grasp what depression actually consists of and don't even realize that 'laziness' is a huge symptom of depression. It's not just me 'giving up' and refusing to help myself. It's like blaming a person in a wheelchair for being unable to walk.
depression,ff2hhnb,t1_feymk4n,1579506343.0,"Of course I haven't achieved any ultimate truth, it's just that it *feels* that way. There's a strong feeling inside me that just *knows* that everything in the universe is pointless. And that there is no afterlife because *you* (whatever that is) will cease to exist just like this concept of *you* didn't exist before you were born. I've tried reading multiple philosophies and spiritual texts. Obviously I know I could be wrong but I can't seem to be convinced otherwise."
depression,ff2ha7m,t1_ff273ak,1579506087.0,"Of course I'm seeking help and willing to try out any and all options. I've been seeking counseling, medication and spirituality too. There may or may not be a solution to my depression but this is the way I feel at this point in my life without any hope of the future."
depression,ff2h51n,t1_ff0aa03,1579505910.0,One of my friends said that to me in an intense conversation we were having on my birthday. I was opposing his opinion that there's no point to life and he said exactly what you did. He died in an accident two months later and I feel devastated since then.
depression,fexyg55,t1_fexxfpd,1579438307.0,Not sure if it's a wave. I've been feeling like this for quite a while now.
depression,fexy8j1,t1_fex9kxi,1579438212.0,It's great that your advice works for you. Doesn't work for all and tbh it's minimizing other people's experience of depression. Acknowledge that people have different experiences other than yours and your advice isn't universal.
depression,fexwhzz,t3_equt0c,1579437623.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that hun, that sounds scary! I wish I could help you but I don't know how to. You try breathing exercises, listening to some music or talking to someone. Very generic advice but I hope you get better."
depression,fexuwgz,t1_fexunxo,1579436864.0,"That's not true either. I can accept that people genuinely love me but still hate myself because I despise who I am as a human being. Sure, others don't feel that way and that's fine. Making a strong statement like you'll never find someone who loves you if you don't love yourself first is dangerous especially on this sub."
depression,fexuftu,t1_fexr85t,1579436392.0,"This is a bunch of bullshit. I genuinely love my family but don't love myself. Also, there are many instances where an SO can actually help you out of depression because often times depression is a side effect of loneliness and nothing else. Of course, that's not the case with everyone. Saying you need to love yourself before loving others implies that you're not worthy of being loved if you can never truly love yourself and in fact, fuels the sed hatred."
depression,fextol6,t3_equvx8,1579435906.0,"Try thinking of the last time that you were focused and studying. Everyone has a completely different method of studying and all won't work for you, you'll end up wasting your time. Write down what you did last time and start doing it without thinking. I find that meditation helps me best and once I start studying, I'm okay. Stay away from social media! Good luck!"
depression,fexsx33,t3_eqv6f1,1579435582.0,"Okay, hear me out, Why do you give a fuck about anyone anyway? I've plenty of family and friends who genuinely love me but I don't feel like I deserve to be loved. My depression and loneliness is still very much real. I can be surrounded by my family and still wanna blow my brains out. I don't think loved ones help with depression, it's only you."
depression,fexs8af,t3_eqv7ox,1579435326.0,You could definitely try it. That was the first medicine that my psychiatrist prescribed and she said it's used for pediatric depression too. I didn't have any side effects but it didn't help me much possibly because I am mildly bipolar.
depression,fexruhh,t3_eqv8e2,1579435193.0,Same! I'm so scared of trying out the simplest tasks that everyone seems to do with such ease

depression,f8bukhv,t1_f88j8fz,1574445665.0,If you believe there's no such thing as anxiety and depression you're on the wrong subreddit dude. I sincerely hope you never have to face it in your life ever because it's going to uproot and question all the things that you've ever believed and yourself.
depression,f8bu92l,t1_f88o4vr,1574445455.0,"You could try taking your parents to your counselor? No matter how stigmatised it is, they're bound to understand because it's about your life and your health. 

I get what you mean by putting work off and being overwhelmed by it. I feel like I'm not gonna make it through the end of my semester. Let's just take things one hour at a time. We can do it."
depression,f88ibqs,t3_dzlqvu,1574355169.0,I totally understand you. I'm in grad school in a foreign country and I regret it too. There's so much of financial responsibility and I hate it. But I'm planning to go back to my parent's. I graduate in May and I'm just pushing through. You can do it too. But it's also okay to quit. It doesn't make you a failure and money you spent on grad school is insignificant compared to your mental health.
depression,f86d4tc,t1_f84wao7,1574295332.0,I'm in my early 20s and I graduate next year but finding a job terrifies me too. What's worse is I have a deadline and my visa will expire so I can't even take a break. Moving halfway across the world to get a master's degree and spending thousands of dollars all would be for nothing.
depression,f6pef7e,t3_dsev1j,1573054489.0,Happy Birthday! I hope you come out of this depression stronger and wiser and have the most amazing year ahead.

depression,f6jh1rk,t3_drge2a,1572894597.0,"Honestly, this post is so motivational. Until now I've been acting how society has conditioned me and being a materialistic, capitalist, studying so I can have a better job and earn more. This has been giving me terrible anxiety. I wanna be free of society's chains and I think your post help me push a little in that direction. Thank you!"
suggestmeabook,f5t43n3,t1_f5sgayf,1572450003.0,I have been and that's what making me existential and have a pessimistic nihilistic worldview. Do you know any that would help me overturn this?
dating_advice,f226t4s,t1_f21temn,1569883108.0,"I know! If people's thoughts, words and actions were in harmony with each other, the world would be so much better. This is kind of making me dislike the whole dating/guessing game."
dating_advice,f226hlz,t1_f20ovxm,1569882887.0,Thanks! Yeah that explains a lot. I don't believe stuff people say on the first date but we had been chatting for months so I thought we sort of knew each other.
