It was easier for me to talk to the kids individually which made it easier to create that bond. This made it easier to be loud. But still it was a temp job, so I tried really hard to get out of that place."

MovieSuggestions,ffd71e4,t3_essm4q,1579814670.0,Weird and effective use of camera angle... In most (I think  all) scenes the camera never moves. The dinner scene is very disturbing mostly because of the camera. No music too. I don't know how this movie was able to work as much as it did.
