depression,f68sz89,t1_f5y6pw9,1572731452.0,"Thanks for posting this! I have been on an NDRI (Wellbutrin) for years and been....'OK'....but I hit with a really bad DD episode and just added a small dose of an SSRI (Paxil) and I'm actually starting to feel better. It's so strange; I have forgotten what it's like to not feel that constant weight. My therapist and I talk about life-changes a lot...pills don't fix the problem, but they can give you a stable platform to build on. Anyway....thanks for sharing."
depression,f68sbzz,t1_f5yjapp,1572731234.0,"Wellbutrin saved my life. I just added a touch of Paxil, as I got smacked with our old pal double depression...but Wellbutrin has been in my toolkit for years now and I have no plans to stop.

Your mileage may vary"
depression,f68r6w4,t1_f5x77ao,1572731017.0,"I just got diagnosed a month ago. It's hard to swallow but at the same time it puts SO much into clear perspective. Makes total sense. I'm still processing but anyway, I wanted to say holy shit I didn't know there were so many of us out here and it kind of helps to know I'm not crazy/alone."

depechemode,f1kz6rx,t1_f1imozc,1569543100.0,Yeah it seems to vary by theatre
depechemode,f1kz4qr,t1_f1iubvg,1569543065.0,hells. yes.
decaf,eyw9jim,t1_eyvq7fo,1567524224.0,"Yeah I recently heard that the opposite of addiction isn't sobriety, it's connection. I try to get out in the world at least once a day even if it's just to walk to the grocery store and be around other humans. I tend to isolate."
stopdrinking,eqaobbg,t1_eqabdm7,1559936796.0,Yep! Same here. I've put I almost15 lbs since this time last year and it shows.

stopdrinking,eor3esq,t1_eor23pm,1558800522.0,"Thanks for that. I feel that in my gut; I'm down to a 6 pack-I can take the leap from here. I put 4 days together late last year and the anxiety got pretty bad, but I never felt like I was in real danger. I don't shake in the mornings or anything.   


 ""I figured if I could make it 'til 5:00 every day I could make it through the night. And I did.""  


That. Yeah I'm gonna hold on to that one. Thanks again."
