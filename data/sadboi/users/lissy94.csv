AmItheAsshole,fjiiwd5,t3_fde4qr,1583368630.0,NTA. Lawyer here: raising a child is not a contract. Your parents canâ€™t ask for their money back nor are you entitled to. Itâ€™s not like they invested that money with the expectation that they would get it all back if it didnâ€™t work out. This is completely ridiculous.

The more  you answer an email or call the better you get at teaching yourself that itâ€™s going to be ok and the terrible thing that you tell yourself is going to happen isnâ€™t going to happen. 

I started therapy this week and itâ€™s helping too. The key is to be kind to yourself. I know itâ€™s more easily said than done but you can do it!"

Also they canâ€™t sue you because you donâ€™t have a contract with them. Hope youâ€™re doing ok!
