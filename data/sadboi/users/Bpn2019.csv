Also I’ll be honest as a husband of a groomer, it takes a serious amount of stability to be a dog groomer. You need fast reflexes, lots and lots of patience for dogs, but more so people, and lots of training.  People don’t always tell you that their dog is a dick, and you can get but, and sometimes they don’t know that the dog or cat can be that way if it is their first time.
