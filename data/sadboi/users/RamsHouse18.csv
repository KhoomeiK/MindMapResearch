NarcissisticAbuse,fr3doou,t3_gma9dj,1589855179.0,"The one red flag I can remember is how my ex told me about 3 months into the relationship is how she didn’t want to take things seriously because she starts to freak out and act crazy. 

Well things got serious and she was right about herself. Sucks that’s she doesn’t know how to stop it."
NarcissisticAbuse,fr3bige,t1_fr3agth,1589853859.0,That is what happened to me. I would say that I was somewhat abusive at certain points because I would react to her and call her names and things I didn’t mean. But my ex just wouldn’t stop trying to push buttons and she would always blame me for everything. And I felt like I could never bring anything up to her because she would push it back onto me and say everything is my fault or that I always do this to try and create drama. It was exhausting and I lost myself and I am still trying to find myself.
BreakUps,fr3acdw,t3_gmdfre,1589853166.0,I hope I will be able to handle it. My ex’s birthday is in a week and that day will be two weeks from when she said we can no longer talk. It’s gonna be a tough one for me and I don’t know how I will handle it.
BreakUps,fr1gnah,t3_glxxry,1589819390.0,"You have to let him go. Block him. Do whatever you need to do. My ex was doing this to me and I told her that she is literally killing me by talking to me and making me feel like there is hope. And then once she felt ok enough and happy enough she left me on the side and said that she wants to enjoy her life drama free with her friends and I didn’t wanna be a friend. And she hasn’t talked to me since. 

So do what you can to move on cuz they are just going to tear you apart."
DecidingToBeBetter,fqzkwgh,t1_fqzjf80,1589769529.0,Thanks! And happy cake day!
DecidingToBeBetter,fqzhyu1,t1_fh1mi6f,1589767776.0,"I’m glad I came back to this. I went back to my ex. And ultimately she ended it and told me she only wants to be friends and I told her sorry but I don’t wanna be your friend. I want more than that. She never responded. 

But on Friday I was moping around at work and my coworker asked me what was going on. I told him “dude I feel like a wreck and I don’t know why I keep talking to my ex. I am getting pissed at everything. I don’t wanna be here and I am just hurt.” 

My coworker told me, “bro if she doesn’t wanna be apart of your life that’s on her. Don’t let her change you or affect you. Just keep doing you cuz you will be ok in the end.”

I changed after that and have looked up. I know I can get through this."
ExNoContact,fqzhfqy,t1_fqn8nst,1589767448.0,"I always try and look back and try to figure out what I could have done differently and that maybe my actions caused a lot of it but I am trying my best to remind myself that no matter how hard or how much I tried the relationship was probably always going to turn out this way. It was always going to end badly. 

And the thing that sucks is there was nothing to stop it."
datingoverthirty,fqxkop7,t1_fqxh971,1589733788.0,Maybe that’s why I feel stuck and keep going to her. I feel like I need her more than I want her. And I know that I am not happy when I am with her
BreakUps,fqqg5ba,t1_fqpq03v,1589564942.0,"Alright I will. I am stuck in a rut this morning. I have been angry, sad, happy, and content all within the first 5 hours of today. But it’s also only been 2 days since she decided we can no longer talk anymore cuz I don’t wanna be her friend. 

My relationship was about a year and half. It was off and on and she wants to be a friend and I want more and I wanna figure out a way to stop the off and on pattern. I am so broken cuz I wanted us to work."
BreakUps,fqpkrvn,t3_gk2mmh,1589548700.0,"I think that’s what hurts the most right now. I know how I could have improved and what I did to the relationship but she still thinks everything was my fault and that she didn’t nothing wrong. It hurts so bad right now. It’s too fresh. 

I just wanna forget about it all already."
ExNoContact,fqmxr3n,t1_fqmkop4,1589485295.0,"Yea it’s kinda dumb how that works. She constantly thought she wasn’t good enough for me and no matter how hard I tried to make her not feel that way it still ended up wrong. 

I will never understand it"
datingoverthirty,fqmwg0u,t1_fqmjwl6,1589484666.0,"I found that in the last couple weeks I got more needy but I also found that she was feeding right into it which is bull shit. She was playing the game but yet she accused me of playing games constantly. I feel used by her to get what she wanted out of everything. 

I am more hurt now than I have ever been. I met her through work and her family still works here and just today when I have seen her family I get angry. I get pissed. I am not being nice to myself right now for sure. I am not taking care of myself. 

This is hard."
datingoverthirty,fqmiqqd,t1_fqmg1qo,1589478115.0,I for sure can feel that I turned into a needy person. I know for a fact that I did. I lost myself. I don’t feel close to the person I was before. I don’t even know where to begin right now.
datingoverthirty,fqmfjw1,t1_fqmc51c,1589476612.0,"I feel that now. Last week I told her that this is all just killing me and being just a friend was killing me inside. But yet she continued to reach out to me. 

She ultimately said yesterday that we shouldnt talk anymore cuz she doesn’t want a relationship. And she wants a friend. And I feel somewhat better right now just knowing that I told her that “I am sorry but I can’t be your friend, I want more than that. I want love and a relationship with you but if you want just a friend then I understand what you want and I understand your wish. If you change your mind you know where to find me”

And I left it at that."
ExNoContact,fqmeyif,t1_fqm6noz,1589476330.0,"To this day I was still taking it. No matter how much I told myself to be patient with it I just couldn’t handle it. And it continued to tear me down. I honestly feel like that’s what she wanted. She was cheated on in a previous relationship and I feel like she thinks every guy will cheat on her so she tears them down. She doesn’t see a problem with how she acts just a problem with how the guy acts. 

I wish I saw one big red flag at the beginning cuz about 3 to 4 months into the relationship she told me she was scared to get serious cuz she starts to freak out and act crazy at some point. But yet she didn’t have a way to stop it and she didn’t wanna go get help for it. It was always me that had to cater to it or do what she wants. And for what? To make myself miserable and turn into nothing. I don’t know who I am anymore"
datingoverthirty,fqmedby,t1_fqm2870,1589476054.0,I am pissed right now. I am angry. I am hurt. But I am trying to find a way to move on. How ever that might be. Guess the first thing I have to do is make myself happy cuz I am not. I am a mess and don’t even know who I am at this point
LosAngelesRams,fqmcrl0,t1_fqmcmfs,1589475304.0,So really they didn’t say anything about when they will ship
LosAngelesRams,fqmceh2,t1_fqm7vtk,1589475134.0,When did you get the email?
ExNoContact,fqlzi2v,t1_fqlyzf8,1589468881.0,Wow that’s kinda brutal. But I guess I really didn’t do a good job of standing up for myself and that’s probably something I needed to do. Instead I just reacted and made things worse.
datingoverthirty,fqlzcqc,t1_fqlwxyy,1589468806.0,Yup I for sure know that I didn’t handle things well. I know what I can fix. And I am doing what I can to hopefully fix that. I am going to therapy now. The relationship was probably doomed from the started which sucks
datingoverthirty,fqlz231,t1_fqlu9el,1589468657.0,Yea I dont know what I have left at this point. I feel empty and feel like I cave to everything right now
ExNoContact,fqlrk90,t1_fqlpk1z,1589464712.0,Yea I am gonna try. It’s a struggle. The relationship has been like this for the past year. So I am have to find a better way to handle this
ExNoContact,fqlrfxt,t1_fqlq4bm,1589464647.0,Hmm interesting. Never heard of those before but it makes sense. I am now going to therapy cuz I feel like I have a problem. I feel like I don’t know how to talk to people. And all I do is react.
LosAngelesRams,fqj5nog,t1_fqj1efh,1589405381.0,Yea I don’t get it. I think blue would have been a better choice. Or at least more yellow
LosAngelesRams,fqi54xm,t1_fqhuubk,1589390277.0,Yea that’s what I am thinking. They are just giving themselves breathing room
LosAngelesRams,fqi51a5,t1_fqhtmm1,1589390225.0,Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this haha it’s probably the unfortunate truth
LosAngelesRams,fqi4uo8,t1_fqhujb7,1589390133.0,Same here. I’m excited to get it
LosAngelesRams,fqi4qfy,t1_fqhzpcz,1589390073.0,Damn. Yea I don’t know what to expect right now. Like someone said above this might be all because of Covid.
LosAngelesRams,fqi4na1,t1_fqi0km2,1589390026.0,Yea same here! I’m sure they are gonna look way better in person too
relationship_advice,fqfnj4i,t1_fqfmntm,1589328126.0,Yea true. I am trying to fight the urge to wanna tell her off right now cuz I am pissed. She knows how crazy I am about her and now she is doing this. It’s bs. I don’t get it.
BreakUps,fqfhz28,t3_gij2sc,1589325224.0,This is true. And something I wanna start living by. I find myself too many times asking myself what I have done wrong or what I could have done better. But in reality there may have been nothing I could have done better. Which is hard to take but currently I am trying to take things day by day and do what I need to do for myself. No one can make us doing anything and no one should have the power over us. We all have our own power over ourselves and we control ourselves.
BreakUps,fqekgo7,t3_ghjk2n,1589309043.0,I wish I could just be free of her. I feel stuck. Saturday she had her son call me to come over and help her cuz she wasn’t feeling well. We ended up in bed with each other and had sex. We talked on Mother’s Day and everything seemed fine but fast forward to today she is ignoring me and I am devastated again. I don’t know what I did wrong.
Anger,fq6v71r,t1_fq57kpy,1589138265.0,Well I use it when I am angry and feel like doing something dumb
Anger,fq4v0vv,t3_gguijs,1589084818.0,"I use a crisis hotline. They might be able to help. Text Start to 741-741.


They help me a lot"
UnsentLetters,fq4flsh,t3_ggndif,1589077135.0,Ouch. This one smacks me right in the face. I feel like my ex could have wrote this. I wish I treated her so much better than I did. But now I have to face my issues and fix them and live with what I have done.
losangeleskings,fp2v0fn,t3_gayds9,1588268344.0,"What a series. I remember going into this game how nervous I was because I went to games 4, 5, and 6. I couldn’t make it to game 7 so being superstitious I was worried that I was gonna ruin the chance for the reverse sweep haha. I am happy they pulled through."
nfl,fp0jo7c,t1_fp0isxn,1588210610.0,No. The Les Snead came out and said they know about the money that they are owed but they are scheduled to get it at a later time.
nfl,fp0jnig,t1_fp0isxn,1588210598.0,No. The Les Snead came out and said they know about the money that they are owed but they are scheduled to get it at a later time.
losangeleskings,fp0ef85,t3_gakw1t,1588207668.0,For sure visiting the Shark tank for game 5 in 2014! That place was rocking and the kings shut it down. Definitely an intimidating place to go to
Anxiety,fowam9h,t1_fov7gpc,1588116109.0,I am going through the same thing right now. I am struggling with my relationship and anxiety. I go through phases and I feel like once a week I struggle and I am going through it right now. I just don’t know how to stop it and I wish it would all just end. I finally have an appointment set up with a therapist for next week but I just wish it would come faster. I am tired of feeling this way.
BreakUps,fop5kva,t3_g8owa0,1587953574.0,"So I did the dumping and I am here. This is the hardest relationship to get past and I am hurting and always wondering what my ex is doing and if she will talk to me. 

I didn’t wanna end the relationship but we weren’t doing the things to fix it and I feel like I was wearing down on her."
datingoverthirty,fojhqfz,t1_fojhaoa,1587821223.0,No I’m not saying you are like my ex at all. Don’t get me wrong. Just the comment that I saw reminded me of what I was going through in my relationship. Guess I should have clarified more. Sorry about that
datingoverthirty,fojh8aj,t1_fojgzok,1587820827.0,Well yea I know it’s not the same situation. It just reminded me of what I went through and how i started to pull out of the relationship after she started asking for my phone. But the constant accusations were there way before the phone thing started.
datingoverthirty,fojghl8,t1_fojfr3b,1587820232.0,Yup. I agree. My ex had a problem with all girls I had on Instagram. And I continuously told her they are all on there cuz I was bored and I added them all before I even met my ex. Well she constantly accused me of cheating on her and she would ask me to show her my phone so I can prove that I wasn’t. I always told her no I am not gonna show my phone because 1. I know I wasn’t cheating and 2. I felt like if I showed my phone the one time them I will always have to show my phone to her and the questioning will only get worse.
BreakUps,foih7wu,t3_g7mq5x,1587786581.0,So I am someone that left my girlfriend cuz of my anxiety and my mental health and all I felt I was doing was hurting her. In my opinion and what happened to me while my girlfriend would try to help me out and say things like you said to your ex was that I wouldn’t hear what she was saying and it wasn’t connecting in my mind and I was stuck only thinking about myself and what was going on in my mind but once I got away from everything and was on my own for a month things started to click more. And I didn’t know what impact all my anxiety had and I didn’t know what I needed to do to get better.
datingoverthirty,foifnnq,t3_g7m7rd,1587785538.0,"So actually I am a weird one I guess. I hate all of the above haha I hate phone calls, I hate texting, I hate snapping, and I hate talking haha. But I really hate phone calls and texting the most because people can easily be misunderstood while texting."
LosAngelesRams,foid9ld,t3_g7m6ay,1587783979.0,Damn I was hoping I just had too many beers
relationship_advice,fo9efu5,t1_fo9e86f,1587617274.0,Yea I guess that’s true. I can’t really avoid the past cuz I find myself getting anxious cuz I want things to go back to how they were when they were good. I am trying to do too much and not let it flow and be free right now. I know I need to work on things still and I need to start controlling only what I can control.
CitiesSkylines,fo8y7qg,t1_fo8mtg2,1587606362.0,How?
UnsentLetters,fnsnf0p,t1_fnrmzwy,1587225149.0,Well I don’t know for sure cuz I was the one that ended it and she was pretty hurt
UnsentLetters,fnqye9g,t1_fnqf6if,1587174968.0,Well I sent it. But now I am worried she isn’t gonna even respond. I am trying to take the mindset that I did it and I shouldn’t expect a response
UnsentLetters,fnqevrp,t1_fnqef4a,1587163239.0,I am debating if I should or not. And if it should be a letter in the mail or a text.
BreakUps,fnqbqo5,t1_fnqb37v,1587161528.0,Yea that’s a good point. It probably is too soon right now. I will let it be for today and see how I feel tomorrow and then do it all over again tomorrow haha
BreakUps,fnqaxq0,t1_fnpyw7r,1587161081.0,Yea I am sorry to hear that. I haven’t talked to her since we ended things. And I am debating on if I should even send it to her. At this point I probably will because I am gonna be thinking about it for a while if I don’t
BreakUps,fnpqpgq,t1_fnpnlfh,1587150246.0,I wish I had the guts to send it to her or even take it to her
BreakUps,fnpqlci,t1_fnpglkd,1587150186.0,I wish you were her but yea it is something that I had to get out. I would love to send it to her.
UnsentLetters,fnozus1,t1_fnoxc5a,1587136724.0,And it’s killing me cuz I wanna send it to her so much but I feel like she doesn’t wanna hear from me
BreakUps,fnnd81n,t1_fnn6nde,1587089699.0,Wow I’m sorry that happened. :(
socialskills,fnnagk8,t3_g2q17b,1587087961.0, Not at all. I am a runner that runs a very populated bike path in California and I get annoyed and think people that don’t say hello are weird haha
BreakUps,fnn04fc,t1_fnmuvj0,1587081605.0,Dang I am sorry to hear that. Things will get better. Just take it day by day.
BreakUps,fnmjbb0,t1_fnmeuvb,1587072454.0,Yea it’s definitely hard to do but I know I am getting there. Breaking up with her was the only thing I felt could be done but now that I am gone part of me feels the same way. Maybe if I did one thing differently that things would have been ok. But then I remind myself that there is no guarantee that things would have been fine. It still might have ended the way it did. Which I am starting to feel ok with. I just get the urge to wanna try and make it work every once in a while. And I can see myself starting to change. Instead of focusing on her and how I can get her back I am noticing that I am trying to find ways to improve myself now.
relationship_advice,fnjfsbp,t1_finefxg,1586998084.0,Can i message you? I have some questions
BreakUps,fng4gim,t1_fnfyolu,1586922094.0,Yea I could try. Idk I will have to think about it. Obviously I still love her and wanna talk to her just a lil nervous about if she would blame me or not.
BreakUps,fnfygwt,t1_fnfq5tq,1586918189.0,Nope I haven't talked to her since I ended it two weeks ago. And I am not sure if I want to tell her cuz she will somehow blame me. What was said in the video is exactly how her behavior is but she would blame me for stuff when I would try to bring stuff up.
BreakUps,fnfndkr,t1_fnfb2cx,1586911524.0,I just looked up some stuff on youtube about anxious attachment and the video I watched described exactly what was going on. I wasn't patient with her and I wasn't really understanding with her. I didn't know what was going on and now I feel like a jerk and feel bad that I didn't listen and know what was going on. I wish I found the video before all of this happened.
BreakUps,fnfktch,t1_fney59m,1586910021.0,I was completely shocked to hear what he was saying. He was describing exactly what was going on in my relationship. I almost feel bad for my ex now. I had no idea that was what could have been happening. I am going to have to watch a few other videos too.
BreakUps,fnfaiqt,t1_fnf3ybk,1586904431.0,Exactly. But it’s hard. I am not at peace right now. I want her back but I feel like my ex thinks that I have to be perfect and she doesn’t have to be. I feel like if I mess up or say something wrong or do something wrong it turns into a fight and then it turns into us breaking up
BreakUps,fnf1zu7,t1_fneqgi1,1586899942.0,Ok that’s me. Sometimes I am sure and other times I’m not sure. Right now I am stuck on her. And it’s hard to break it. I wish it was easy to just put everything back together and keep it together
BreakUps,fnem39b,t3_g19ujm,1586891799.0,Yea if you could share the videos that would be awesome! I am trying to get out of an on and off relationship right now and everything you described about your relationship was exactly what was going on in mine.
baseball,fnekbpd,t3_g17vsq,1586890902.0,What did I just watch
BreakUps,fnbz8bp,t1_fnbwhe1,1586825296.0,Well yea that makes sense. I guess what made me mad though is when she would question me about it. It always seemed to happen right after I would leave her house for the night and each time it would be her sending me a screen shot and texting me to enjoy her and she can have me. I never even had a chance to defend myself and show her how nothing is going on. So I would get defensive and react which then made it all worse. So I was tired of it cuz I knew I wasn't doing anything and I was mad cuz it never stopped no matter how hard I tried to prove to her that I wanted her and only her. But overall I think I should have been more patient and understanding.
BreakUps,fnbvnak,t1_fnbr68a,1586823224.0,"Ok well since we are gonna get into that haha let me first start of by saying her previous relationships all ended cuz she was cheated on. So in the first month or two of us being official I had a coworker, who is a female, ask me about where to look find hockey tickets for a certain game, which happened to be a game that me and buddies already had tickets for. So I was just being nice and offering to help a coworker and I didn’t see it as a red flag at all. I see it now how someone with trust issues or even no trust issues would take that. It seems shady. So yes that could have raised her concern. 

And then before I even started talking to my now ex I used to go on Instagram and Twitter and follow a bunch of girls and like their posts. Well my ex would go on google and search my username all the time and she would see all of those pictures come up. She would then question me about them and ask who I am talking to. To which I would tell her “ babe that’s all from the past. I can’t go back and change any of that now. I have you and want no one else. But I am sorry that they are still there. I am gonna try and figure out a way to get them removed so you don’t see them.” Well that exchanged happened at least 5 or 6 times and I would get even angrier each time it happened cuz she was hurting herself cuz she went looking for it. So I get that part as well about how it would be weird but I would constantly show it that it was from years ago but it would still get brought up. 

So yea there were things that happened but in my eyes i only wanted her and I was with her for a reason but she didn’t believe me when I said i only wanted her"
BreakUps,fnbqogc,t1_fnbj90u,1586820424.0,True. That’s definitely something that could have been better. But it was toxic cuz she would accuse me of going behind her back and hanging with other woman. To which I would reassure her that I wasn’t but then she would t stop accusing me until I would snap and get really angry and start calling her things that I didn’t really mean. And then I felt like I couldn’t leave my phone cuz she would blow it up if I didn’t answer her or even tell her where I was. And I felt like I couldn’t see my friends cuz she would accuse me of wanting to be single and then she would threaten to broke up with me. So I stopped trying and I stopped helping out. I stopped speaking up. I stopped doing the things I love. I lost myself. But yet I still wanna be with her. Why?
BreakUps,fnbq8yn,t1_fnbfnx1,1586820186.0,That’s exactly what happens to me. My ex and I broke up and got back together at least 10 times and it’s the same time each time. I question why I came back and then once it’s done I question why I left and why I didn’t do anything to change anything. I feel stuck in a cycle
BreakUps,fn7vbhr,t1_fn70c6h,1586728367.0,I definitely could have tried harder. I was the one that ultimately left her because of it. I basically had a breakdown and told her that I need everyone to leave me alone and that included her. I get that it hurt her a lot and now I just don’t really have the guts to apologize to her at this point. And frankly I don’t know if she even wants to hear from it.
BreakUps,fn6yq4y,t1_fn6s8o9,1586709952.0,"I guess i used my mental health as a way out. But in the relationship I couldnt think with an open mind and i would just freeze and break down. I dont know why it happened. 

But ultimately i left because i felt like i was causing more damage than good. That goes with me hurting her and hurting myself as well. 

But who knows maybe i walked away too soon and didnt find a way to fix it while in the relationship and part of me wants to go back to her but i know the damage is done at this point."
BreakUps,fn6ydp5,t1_fn6wprx,1586709758.0,That would be nice. I feel like i cant come here anymore cuz everyone is younger than 20.
nfl,fn6wk8w,t3_fzwsgz,1586708752.0,As a rams fan should I even speak up? I can name 4 just in this offseason.
BreakUps,fn4mfiv,t1_fn4b7hb,1586644401.0,Well thankfully today is only one day. So get up and try again tomorrow.
UnsentLetters,fn4md8z,t1_fn4b5wy,1586644362.0,Thankfully writing that in that moment and getting it all out definitely helped out a lot. I don't know how I would be feeling right now if I didn't get all of that out. I wish I could reach out to her but I know personally I need to move on. I know I don't need to keep on feeling this way and I know I will be ok. Hope all is well with you!
ExNoContact,fn47732,t3_fzee1w,1586635451.0,Hahah jeez that sounds brutal.
UnsentLetters,fn1h5v2,t1_fn171xl,1586561919.0,"It’s all good. I was definitely in a low moment and balling my eyes out when I wrote that yesterday. But somehow it actually helped to get it out. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders right now. And I feel like everything is going to be ok. I still do have moments where I hurt through out the day but I feel like I am able to finally accept the fate of the relationship.

I am sorry that you had to go through it as well."
ToyotaTacoma,fmzv2pp,t3_fyet7j,1586530140.0,Agreed! Love the one I have. Makes a huge difference
UnsentLetters,fmzpyh5,t1_fmzmo4l,1586527019.0,And do I wish you were her right now. I wish she was able to see this so she knows how I feel and why I had to walk away and let her go. I hurt so much right now but I know it needs to be done this time. I know I need to find my strength to walk away and be myself again. To be someone that can be happy and enjoy my life and enjoy the things that made me happy before all of this. It just sucks that it comes at this cost of losing someone I love.
BreakUps,fmu0p1a,t3_fx3ylt,1586382412.0,I am right there with you. Granted it’s only been a week.  I am just doing what I can to get through those moments where I wish she was back but it’s tough.
Vent,fmst0k3,t1_fmsor1f,1586361538.0,I don’t know if I can directly address with the other person with what I have done at this point. I don’t think she wants to talk to me. And frankly I don’t know if i should talk to her at this point cuz she doesn’t need the drama anymore. I just don’t know how to address myself and look past everything I have done.
Vent,fmsfbth,t1_fknuei1,1586354280.0,Well I didn’t go anywhere but I know I need to change myself I just don’t know how.
BreakUps,fmqbrp8,t1_fmq2npv,1586296650.0,"He might be but after 5 months i honestly don’t know what his mind set would be. It’s hard to say after 5 months if he still is thinking about you. But for me I should have never ended things to begin with. I know it was me running away from my problems and no facing them or fixing them. I know I could have done better. But I know I couldn’t keep dragging her down that path and I ran out of room of telling her that I was gonna fix myself and take care of my depression and anxiety. I said I was going to fix it for too long and never did anything about it. 

But if I were you, you should focus on getting yourself better and move on and if he does come back he will."
BreakUps,fmpuq8u,t1_fmlqva6,1586287690.0,"Ok. Well I am trying my best to not be so hard on myself right now. It’s tough to not just wanna beat myself up over all of it. I thought I would be able to figure out a way to find myself during this time but only thing I have found is that I miss her and wanna talk to her. I haven’t done anything else. 

We never used those tools to help. It was talked about time and time again but we just never followed through with it. I have referrals for counseling but haven’t followed through and met with someone."
BreakUps,fmpsol0,t1_fmpkn1n,1586286622.0,Yea i get that it sucks. And hope you find a way through this. But I don’t even know if I taking this “break” the right way right now. The whole time all I have done is think about her and that’s it. I haven’t even worried about getting myself together. It’s just too hard without her. Especially with everything going on.
nfl,fmpjjbm,t1_fmphzeo,1586281970.0,True. I don’t know of any chargers fans here
BreakUps,fmpdsrv,t1_fmmyx4q,1586279046.0,"Yea it’s really fresh for me and I am fighting the urge to wanna reach out to her right now. I just feel like she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore and also I don’t wanna reach out and hurt her more. I am beating myself up pretty bad over all of this right now. Especially cuz she was always the one there for me no matter what. And I pushed her away. I honestly feel like such a crappy person right now. And wish I could go back and fix everything right away. 

But I wish I could just tell her how much I love her and how much she means to me. :’(

This sucks."
nfl,fmpbkz8,t1_fmpa93w,1586277932.0,I don’t know about everyone. I am a rams fan here in LA and just at work I am outnumbered by raiders and 49ers fans.
BreakUps,fmlogv6,t1_fml0gr3,1586190292.0,Wow. I never thought of it that way. I am in her ex’s shoes and to me I felt like I couldn’t fix anything while I was in the relationship. It has been a week since I left her but maybe it is me running away from my issues and maybe it is me not wanting to face them and tackle them. I know what I need to do but I just don’t do it. I would always tell myself that I need to fix myself for the relationship but I just never did. I don’t know why I didn’t and why I didn’t just step up and take care of myself with her by my side. I hate that I hurt her cuz of this and I wish I could go back and change it right now. But the damage is done. :(
BreakUps,fmkcus1,t1_fmkazeg,1586150837.0,"I feel you on that. I’m sorry that you are going through this. Just take it day by day and stay busy. I know it’s hard right now with everything going on. 

But same here. Leaving her was the hardest thing I have ever done. But a big part of it is cuz she also has two kids who were seeing all of it as well. And we got to the point where we were fighting a lot cuz I had no motivation to do anything but go to work. I wasn’t helping out anymore and I just lost myself. It wasn’t cuz I didn’t want to help out I just had nothing except the depression. I couldn’t get out of my own head. 

I just miss the three of them a lot. And wish I was ok and could just make everything ok."
BreakUps,fmkaavk,t1_fmk9r1q,1586148714.0,"That’s all you can do. Just stay busy. My ex was really angry with me and probably doesn’t want to talk to me cuz I break up with her. But I felt like I had no choice but to leave at the time cuz I was in such a dark state. I want to reach out to her and tell her how sorry I am for all of this cuz I care so much about her but I also don’t want to reach out cuz I don’t want to hurt her again by telling her how sorry I am. So it sucks. 

So I am still depressed cuz I don’t have her but I feel like I am able to fix my own issues right now."
BreakUps,fmk6sru,t3_fvqemd,1586146018.0,"So I am coming from the perspective your ex has. I am the one that ended it and I was the one that ended up depressed and anxious during the relationship. 

I love my ex a lot and wish I didn’t break her heart and hurt her. She means the world to me and still can’t imagine a life without her. But I know that I wasn’t healthy for her anymore cuz I was putting to much on her cuz of all my mental health issues. I needed to get away from the situation because there was no other way for me to fix myself and love myself again. I would love to make things work with her but I know i can’t expect her to wait for me. She deserves to be happy and it wouldn’t be fair to her to have her wait for me anymore."
CitiesSkylines,fmisn6a,t1_fdjyy87,1586116101.0,how do you lower the streets with the move it mod? I cant figure it out
ExNoContact,fmciiq8,t3_fudc2h,1585946331.0,A toxic one and for me it’s not even close. I keep finding myself wanting to go back to her even tho I know how bad it is for me. My ex and I have broken up and gotten back together at least 10 or more times and it always ends up in the same fights. But I can’t get away from it.
ExNoContact,fmbusb1,t1_fm8vqfu,1585933595.0,"Ooo yea I know she did love me but it was almost suffocating at times cuz she wanted me around all the time and when I wasn’t with her there was always a fight somehow. I wish I could talk to her now and let her now that she needs to talk to someone about all the trust issues but I have done that before and at this point it wouldn’t do much. I know she needs to figure it out on her own now but it’s just hard to not want to reach out to her right now. I know I have things that I need to work on myself cuz during all of this I lost myself and turned into someone I never wanted to be. Each time I was accused or each time we got in a fight I would say things and call her things I didn’t mean cuz I was getting angry with her. I did get better about it the last month or so with not saying things I didn’t mean. When we weren’t together and we were fighting I started ignoring her calls and texts and I was telling her I am not gonna answer right now because I do not want to say something I don’t mean. I know I could have handled all of it better by trying to talk it out and control my anger but I just felt like at the time ignoring her was gonna help me calm down and not say something I was going to regret later. 

But hey at least you recognize what you feel like you did wrong. I know it hurts a lot right now but what has helped me look past my angry moments that i ended up regretting was that we make mistakes and we can’t take them back so why keep looking at it and regretting it, just use the mistakes as reminders and learn from them for the future. Regretting and holding onto things will only make it hurt worse. In my opinion everything happens for a reason. And yes the things we have done in the past hurt us but either we can continue to let them hurt us or we can learn from them and grow into someone more."
