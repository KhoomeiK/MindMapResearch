You are signing off tune and sound like you are shy on the microphone. 

Take your time on your writing and don't rush to produce your music. Work on your craft. My piece of advice take 6m-1year just practicing everything step by step, production, writing lyrics, singing lessons, mixing, mastering ect. 

Don't look for perfection but aim for progress. Only release music when you have a finished product. I understand you are a new artist and want to get yourself noticed, but don't rush. 

Good luck."
