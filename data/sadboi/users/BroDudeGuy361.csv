with:""

Vitamin K1  travels to our livers more effectively than it does to our bones or blood vessels. The liver is where we use vitamin K to make the proteins involved in blood clotting, so vitamin K1 is better at supporting blood clotting than it is at providing other health benefits.

MK-7 is much more effective than K1 at reaching bone. This doesn’t just make it good for bones: our bones use vitamin K to produce a hormone known as osteocalcin, which improves metabolic and hormonal health and increases exercise performance. Thus, MK-7 better supports these health benefits than K1 . The portion of MK-7 that reaches the liver, moreover, stays active in the liver much longer than K1 before being broken down; as a result, MK-7 is even better than K1 at supporting blood clotting.

MK-4 is taken up by our tissues very rapidly after we consume it. While it hasn’t been studied as carefully as MK-7, it may be less effective than MK-7 at reaching liver and bone but more effective at reaching most other tissues. This would make it better at protecting those tissues from calcium deposits and cancer development and supporting sex hormone production through its direct actions within our sex organs.""

This time, you started crying after sharing the gospel with someone you are attracted to. I don't see why you would feel bad about that. 
Did she respond negatively or in another way that you didn't expect? Do you think the issue may be unconscious loneliness or disappointment in not finding a girl that shares the same feelings toward Christ as you do?

If one needs to appeal to others to better understand the knowledge in the Bible, that doesn't necessarily refute it's value. Besides the examples in the Bible of prophets teaching others, and modern day pastors, we're told in Romans 12:6‭-‬7 NIV:

""We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach;"" 

Proverbs 18:15 NIV:
""The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.""

There's nothing wrong with seeking knowledge from others to help discern what is being told in the Bible. Yes, it is the Holy Spirit that will help us come to conclusions, and we aren't meant to take any man's words as the ultimate answer but instead use them as guidance on how we read and study the Bible.

Finally, we are all created with free will. That includes the free will to choose to take things out of context or to choose to not spend time trying to understand God's words."

exchristian,fnxcbix,t3_g493or,1587335758.0,"To me, the Twitter post seems like a person acknowledging their perceived shortcomings but trusting that God still loves her. We can't necessarily assume she is judging others for their actions. I could be wrong though since I don't know her or have seen any other posts.

But yes, it's unfortunate that there are many Christians that are quick to judge others. In my opinion, these self-professed Christians tend to seem like the majority but are not.

Christians should be trying to live by Christ's words in Matthew 7:1-3: “Do not judge, or you too will be judged.  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"" 

and Paul's words in Romans 14:4:
""Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand."""

Christians,fnv3qh1,t1_fnuvfef,1587279234.0,"It is my understanding that the ""ministry of death"" was referring to the Book of Law of Moses, which included temporary ceremonial law and ordinances, as well as the punishment for not following them. As you mentioned, there were numerous laws and the 10 commandments were part of them. However, they were of seperate imporance. 
Deuteronomy 31:26(NIV) says:""Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.""

Deuteronomy 10:4-5 (NIV) says:
""The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me. Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the Lord commanded me, and they are there now.""

So the Book of the Law of Moses was placed beside the ark, and the 10 Commandments were inside it. This highlights their differences. I like the further explanation from https://www.eternalgod.org/question-and-answer-1233/ . It states:

“The reference to the ministry of death includes the death penalty for violating God’s spiritual law. The penalties were first written in the Book of the Law of Moses and then engraved on massive stones (Deuteronomy 27:2-3, 8; Joshua 8:30-32, 34). Since Christ died for us, we don’t have to pay the death penalty, if we repent of our sins and obtain forgiveness. In addition, the ritual sacrificial laws, which were among the laws written on stones, could not forgive sins–they only reminded the sinners of their sins. The Levitical priesthood was, in that sense, a ministry of death, as people would still not be able to obtain eternal life, even though they brought sacrifices.”

With this background, let us again carefully review verses 3 and 7 of 2 Corinthians 3. In verse 3, reference is made to the Ten Commandments, which were written “on tablets of stone.” Christians today are to keep the Ten Commandments in their hearts–that is, it is not sufficient to possess tablets of stone which include the Ten Commandments, but we have to internalize them and obey them “from the heart.”

Verse 7, however, does NOT refer to the Ten Commandments. As stated above, the “ministry of death, written and engraved on STONES,” refers to massive stones (compare again Deuteronomy 27:2-3, 8; Joshua 8:30-32, 34), on which ALL of God’s laws were written–not just the Ten Commandments, which are spiritual and eternal, but also temporary ritual laws regarding washing and sacrifices. While the two tablets with the Ten Commandments did not include any penalties, the subsequent massive stones did.To reiterate: The Ten Commandments were written on TABLETS OF STONE–the laws of the Book of Moses, including the penalties for sin, were engraved on COMPLETE, MASSIVE STONES.

2 Corinthians 3:2-11 does not teach that the Ten Commandments are abolished. Quite to the contrary, the passage teaches that the Ten Commandments must be kept today. However, they must be kept in the Spirit, that is, they must be applied in our lives with their spiritual intent, as Christ clearly explained in Matthew 5-7. In doing so, we can escape death and inherit eternal life. If we refuse to do so, Christ’s warning in John 3:36 is still applicable for us today: “He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him (Revised Standard Version).”

Luke 4:16 shows that Jesus read on the Sabbath:

If that's the case, then it should be considered if that person has a condition that puts them at a higher risk."

I understand that people say that churches changed the day of worship to Sunday since that is when Christ was resurrected. However, if that's the reasoning, then they are following the culture of man versus the command of God to keep the seventh day holy.
