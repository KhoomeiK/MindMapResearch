This is entirely different than taking it somehow in the lungs of a living person and being effective there.

Rossman says he would expect chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the lab, based on what is known about its ability to raise endosomic pH. “But there’s often a huge gap between how it works in the lab cells and how it works in the body,” he says.

The drug is potentially dangerous when used at high doses or for prolonged periods. It can cause permanent blindness and even death. Rossman and Seidah agree that larger clinical trials are a must before chloroquine is considered safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19. ""

> I understand why they are frustrated they want express service in a line not prepared to deal with deaf folks.

They aren't. Nobody ever implied they ever did. Getting told they're faking it, then having to wait at the curb to get their order taken instead of ordering at the window (there's no difference in taking the order verbally or written) even when the drive through is empty, then having to wait 30 minutes for 2 drinks and fries (don't tell me that's normal and everything faster is ""express service"" - I never had to wait that long even for complicated orders and when it's busy) and then having a nice employee tell them that the manager told them to wait there for a ""bad reason"" and that the manager threw away the food when he wasn't looking so he had to retype the cancelled order. All that together is what frustrated them and I don't know why you don't want to acknowledge that and instead want to reiterate that they're just angry that they weren't pampered by ""express service"". That's just disingenuous. Also everyone is prepared to read a 2 line order - again you don't need special equipment to do that.

> My point is MCD has a app, that handles that https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/mobile-order-and-pay.html

They also tell you to drive to the window and let them help you with the order when you're hard of hearing/ speaking. So you can't be mad if they don't use your favorite way when the restaurant is offering different ways. You aren't mad at other customers when they don't use the app for the drive through, are you?

>I know they have rules on how long fries can sit. and I'll bet they have rules on how long an order can sit before being delivered. -quality control, vs vindictiveness.

And I told you that in these cases they just redo the order right when they throw it away. There is no need for another employee to notice that they threw it out and retype the order. That would only happen if they cancel the order, as in not having any intention to make it again.
> McD doesn't normally have curbside ordering or delivery. But that's what they wanted, and they got.

They didn't want curb side delivery or ordering. They wanted to order and receive food in the drive through just like other people do or how they would in any other drive through.

>It wasn't fast enough? maybe use the app, or go inside.

Aside from the old ""not fast enough"" straw man, what exactly would make it faster for them to show them the phone inside instead of at the drive through window?"

Concerning the 'timed out' theory I would find that a very highly unlikely accident under this circumstances, but the other employee already stated that he had to retype the order when he noticed they threw it out. They just redo the order directly if they mess up, there's no need for another employee to notice and having to retype the order when it wasn't intentionally cancelled.

As stated in my other comment, speculation about their motives for showing the video and the managers behavior are totally separate issues for me. Nothing the customers did was unreasonable and warranted this type of reaction."

I really get the impression that you watched a different video: Not the customers threw the food away but the manager. The nice man who went outside to get their order said they sent him away, after which the manager threw the order away. The nice employee had to redo it after he noticed when he came back: https://youtu.be/_gXbWtGAcS8?t=714.

You'd have to speculate if they want internet points, I don't know them so I have no idea. But I don't have to speculate about what they asked for and how it was handled.

I also don't see how it's different for the employee to push in the order if she get's it verbally or by reading it, but you're right maybe she was overwhelmed by the situation somehow and waiting in a separate place for the order to be taken is not that bad by itself.

In combination with being told ""He's faking it."", letting them wait for 30 minutes for 2 drinks, a burger and a medium fries and then being told that the manager did it ""for the wrong reasons"" and that they threw the food away after the nice employee went away, does make it seem somewhat deliberately and bad.

How is going inside more easy for the deaf person? They have to order the exact same way by showing his phone, just that he just can't have food if he can't exit the car for any of the mentioned reasons.

So it does not say that they are bad pets for prepared households, but they are hard to accommodate for, for many people and are given away very often.

They go back where the cart returns are - there's one over there, I can show you where that is."". He only noticed the video camera in the end, so this could not have set him off in the beginning.

Even if he would not be polite - if I show disrespectful behavior towards others and/or their property, how can I feel so special that I need to be super-politely made aware of that or else I'll try to fight you? That's not how the world works, especially not in a big city like NY. Try stepping on people's feet in the metro and getting pissy about non-polite responses.

And for your argument that he's looking for conflict for the channel. Maybe, maybe not. He says that in most cases people just bring their cart back and that's end of story. We could speculate if that's true or not, just as we could speculate over his true intentions. What I don't need to speculate about is that I find the initial request reasonable and polite and the driver's reaction to be the opposite of that.

The big difference afaik (I'm not a lawyer) is that you (or a lawyer) and the prosecutor have to present your case to the judge who alone decides on ruling and extend of punishment (within the penalty range of the relevant laws) and not a jury. There are some cases which have to be decided by 3 judges and 2 ""Schöffen"", which are laymen judges who applied for this position, but generally there is no jury anymore since 1924. 

This seems to lead to more technical arguments, based on legal knowledge than trying to appeal to a jury, to an extend. Again I'm not an expert in neither the German nor the American court systems, but this is what i was told about it.

On the moral side of looking at accidents, I agree that for many people there is a strange fascination with accidents and in itself I don't see this as malicious either. The problem with accidents is that gawkers cause further problems, like obstructing emergency services. The moment someone realizes he could potentially harm this person and still values his urge of sensation over the well being of another person, in my opinion it is legitimate to 'remind' him, that his actions, even if they are 'normal human behaviour', have consequences for others by issuing a small fine.

On the topic of photographing injured/ dead persons without consent, the very first article of our ""Grundgesetz"", which is comparable to your constitution (or the amendments specifically) says ""Human dignity is inviolable and it is the duty of all state powers to respect and protect it."". So the prohibition of photographing a helpless person in order to to display this person's helplessness is at its core not necessarily about protecting privacy, but more about protecting this person's human dignity. Since these persons are helpless, as in unable to protect their dignity themselves, the German state is bound by the first article of its Grundgesetz where the civil rights are formulated, to protect it for them."

For instance I've been in quite a few arguments with people on here about free speech. They claim that hate speech is not protected speech. But this is entirely false. Hate speech is free speech. The constitution does protect that.

So are you arguing that libel/ defamation is free speech, or are you trying to explain that libel/ defamation laws are different by bringing up an example of an entirely different topic? In the first case your own laws are disagreeing with your opinion and in the second case I don't think you know how to form valid arguments.
