adhd_anxiety,fqhpoja,t1_fqdw1yz,1589381886.0,I also got my degree in education. It was moreso a cop-out for me because I needed to complete a degree with a job at the end of it (not like my arts degree). I completed the program knowing full well I didn't want to teach kids in a classroom but I had no idea what else to do. So when I graduated and moved to a new province I applied to volunteer tutor adults who couldn't read. It's been just over 5 years and every year is different and more challenging but also super rewarding. It's in a non-profit organization but it's getting standardized in September so I'll be competing with teachers in the public system in terms of salary and benefits.

CPTSD,forn3a1,t1_fnoukpm,1588015024.0,"Honestly, I clicked an ad on Reddit. I used BH before but only for 2 months. When you sign up you answer a few questions and then within a day (in my experience) you get paired with a licensed therapist. It looks like you can request a different therapist if something doesn't mesh but I met with mine twice now and I love her."

CPTSD,fnkucsk,t1_fnb7xd2,1587040171.0,I have the same thoughts and they intrude any time I meet someone that I want to like me. It's like we continually set ourselves up for failure even though the world wants to give us a chance. I don't have any solutions other than to practice positive self talk. My mind races in circles too but we cannot control anyone else's emotions and thoughts so we might as well *try* to see how far to get with someone.
CPTSD,fn9vril,t3_g0fdsc,1586785704.0,Yes. I chose a job where I am an outsider to my colleagues but have more in common with the clients we serve. It gives me a middle ground between worlds.

I was actually talking to my dad two weeks ago and out of nowhere he casually mentioned him and mom fighting when my sisters and I were small and I cannot remember what I said to him at the time but I remember needing to get off the damn phone because it triggered a response of flight in me that I felt so many years later and through an invisible phone line. I was never physically abused either but the pain is real."
CPTSD,fn7nha9,t3_fzqzy4,1586723847.0,I am this way too. I still occassionally get paranoid that all my coworkers talk about me and judge me and assign psychology to me behind my back. Part of the reason is that I moved to this city to escape my own family and I vowed to not let my story out. As I learned to trust my coworkers (who are my only friends here by the way) I have let some of them in on my part trauma but only in tiny bite sized pieces. I fully regret that now because I'm paranoid everyone there knows. They're all so nice to me and I keep finding ways to push them away.

I am under the impression that as long as you don't drive to trails, and that they're in our neighborhoods that we can walk there? The news is changing so fast, so I don't appreciate the tone.

NovaScotia,fm5wau9,t3_ft8x2p,1585781268.0,I just got home from a walk behind Cole Harbour Place and we saw two new barricades that weren't blocking anything. I mean that they weren't closing any of the trail exit points off but they weren't there on Monday. Does this mean more closures are coming?

CPTSD,fm5oefj,t3_fsebo2,1585776790.0,"I taught myself this mantra when I decided to be the first one in my family to go to university .. solely on student loans I might add! It was the only way I could mentally get out of my situation living at home with my mother. I didn't have a plan either so ""fake it till you make it"" got me through an Arts degree and then Education. What the hell. My passion and love is not with people, it's with animals and so I faked being a people person and now am working in a good job but without my heart there. I do, however, work with adults who have all mostly survived their own traumas and I'm kind of an untrained counselor to them now too. It's a mess."
CPTSD,fm5ncu7,t3_ft8e65,1585776211.0,"I'm happy for you that you can reflect now on some of the obvious pointers from your past. I can recall a similar meeting in junior high where I was acting out and the principal called a meeting with my mom. She would never have responded the way your mother did, she would have kept it all inside and left me to deal with it myself."
CPTSD,fm5m4wa,t3_fsuuot,1585775536.0,"You know, I am only recognizing for the first time that the reason I feel like I'm not taking taking this as serious emotionally as others are *because* of my trauma. Huh. Don't get me wrong, I'm doing all the right things as advised by the health professionals but the mental taxation of ""what will we do?"" Hasn't hit me. I goffed back when Italy were talking about closing schools. I simply never thought of something of this magnitude to get the world the way it did. 

That said, I will need to need your advice and think clearly about how my conversations go. My dad called me about two weeks ago to unload his fear and experience and I realised he uses me as a support and it's mentally taxing."
Anxiety,flrcqz3,t3_fq8z5a,1585417577.0,"Dude, this is me. I have two bold (unread) messages in my inbox right now from adult students who are waiting to hear what we're going to do for classes and learning. I haven't specifically set up boundaries for texting during this and I know they're all messed up from the quarentine so I messaged both back initially that I would get back to them on Monday. However, they both replied back with some excuse as to why they needed to talk... I left them unread and will address it on Mon like I told them but my mind is in circles over doing it."
CPTSD,flqyv65,t1_flqw6pf,1585409350.0,"Thanks again, you're right. I will call the clinics and get advice on my next steps. Unfortunately, I think I'll have to wait until Monday but I'll see about it today in any case and come up with a list or an action plan. 

Yes, it's hard but I think you hit the nail on the head with my belief that doctors are dysfunctional authority figures and that my experiences and beliefs aren't theirs. They do deal with a lot of web-md hypochondriacs but I like to go prepared with some idea of what I'm going through because when it comes time to actually go and talk about it, my survival brain turns on and my memory is affected. So I wrote it down before and then put off planning a visit and now covid. 

Sorry you experienced the doctors being so offended when you come to then knowing some idea of your own symptoms. That must have been hard to cope with, and then having to find other doctors to begin the process over again.

 I really needed to read your last comment, too. Who do I think I am?! I am a human and I need help. Thanks."
CPTSD,flqnf1n,t1_flomkms,1585400964.0,"Thank you for your thorough, understanding comment. 

I never thought of it as being chronic vs acute. I definitely have chronic anxiety that goes back as far as I can remember. I remember volunteering for an anonymous interview for a psychology student once and some of the questions I was asked really highlighted this as proof. But, I was so so good at ignoring my symptoms because I drowned myself in hobbies and other busy work so I didn't have much time to reflect honestly with myself. 

You're right about the follow up from doctors too. I guess I understand they're too busy to call me up and go through things. I didn't describe everything wrong with my trust issues there though. I have never felt a human connection to healthcare professionals, which, when I'm describing symptoms   and need a human to relate, becomes a feeling of dependence and helplessness. I take pride in being independent and strong as a rule to avoid feeling weak and incompetent. My doctors never explained what psychosomatic means. My doctors never explained that I was feeling what I thought were real symptoms related to mental health. Nobody ever asked me about my history or mental health so a lot of my beliefs and trust stem from the abhorrent thought that I don't matter to them and I'm just wasting resources trying to look after myself with a doctor when I've been going just fine on my own. 

I live in Canada so I do have free healthcare. My partner has benefits but a basic package that might not cover specialists. Again, I haven't done the work I need to do to figure it out. Also, my province has a notoriously bad waiting system for low cost therapists and mental health practitioners. I know I sound hopeless here and will commit to figuring it out this upcoming week; I have been putting it off for a while because I prefer to play the victim card. I'm trying to take more control over this though. 

Thanks again for reading."
