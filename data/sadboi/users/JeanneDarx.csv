spaceporn,esdfrrw,t3_c72vow,1561856129.0,Love this picture
BattlefieldV,esbo5o0,t1_esav1dg,1561803089.0,man... gotta give that a bash XD
BattlefieldV,esbo570,t3_c6prwd,1561803067.0,"I'm also worried about these issues... when will it all be fixed? Stuttering I've had for WEEKS actually, now only a tiny bit worse after last update. 

Also very demoralizing when you see the bullets hit the enemy but no damage is shown and you shoot and keep shooting some more and then \*PLOINK\* you're dead. 

Evidently, I wasnt the only one using Alt+F4 when I want to quit the game XD"
SuicideWatch,ertc8ff,t1_ert7sd2,1561238330.0,"Good reminding me of that book, I have it on my to read list. I'm reading meditations of Marcus Aurelius rn. That, and a journal by a soldier who fought in ww2.

I'm sure it's good. What is the fiction about, what elements you like to write about, the plot, or character design, anything else?"
SuicideWatch,ert3hp7,t1_ers26v0,1561231431.0,"So what book are you reading lately?
And what do you like to write about?"
SuicideWatch,err8mik,t3_c3hvs3,1561163350.0,What do you like to read?
AnthemTheGame,eq4efms,t1_eq4dpr5,1559775090.0,Hopefully!
AnthemTheGame,eq4d5y0,t1_eq4crho,1559774374.0,"I never was any lucky finding leggos on the live server, only temporary when the chances were ""accidently"" high for few days,that was at the beginning after game released tho.. Anyway, last night when I played strongholds, this new gate mission in freeplay and cataclysm, I got a decent amount of leggos! So, way better drop chance now on this test server."
LowSodiumAnthem,eq4cu1z,t1_eq4cnie,1559774180.0,"Yeah I also had few crashes, and also connection error but hopefully they will fix this before the pts comes live. Thanks again man!"
LowSodiumAnthem,eq4axe5,t1_eq4anxu,1559773072.0,Nvidia shadowplay ^^
LowSodiumAnthem,eq44sdy,t1_eq44k2q,1559769218.0,Haha ohyeah I can imagine
LowSodiumAnthem,eq3zbsn,t1_eq3wwof,1559765942.0,U mean npc voices? Being added later they said
LowSodiumAnthem,eq3vtcs,t1_eq3vrob,1559764015.0,It gives armor
LowSodiumAnthem,eq3ughn,t1_eq3sko1,1559763266.0,"Tbh the loot is better on the test server than the live server, so maybe you won't get disappointed once it's out!"
LowSodiumAnthem,eq3nlo3,t1_eq3n4tm,1559759425.0,Hahaha I can imagine you did.
LowSodiumAnthem,eq3i4ov,t1_eq3hmal,1559756385.0,"Yes exactly ^^
Haven't tried much gm3 yet but I'm hearing ppl get showered with good loot there"
LowSodiumAnthem,eq3ef2a,t1_eq3dx8i,1559754351.0,"Thank you for enjoying this :D
So far it seems like the loot drop got a little buff which is great, really. I do like the 3 chest challenge part you get inside the storm gate, the idea feels kinda fresh so concept is great. Cataclysm is quite tricky, you need good team play to finish it and it's very interesting boss fight in the end!!
I also uploaded the new story mission if you're interested to check it out! ^^
Regarding complaints, there are a bunch of bugs here and there but feedback is being sent to devs so hopefully they will polish the game soon enough!"
LowSodiumAnthem,eq36zg5,t1_eq34nyq,1559750590.0,Yeah.... That's the internet for you i guess :/

LowSodiumAnthem,eq34g4k,t1_eq33url,1559749388.0,"you know... i have actually been more lucky with loot on the test server than live one! so yeah, a slight increase in leggo drops! ive been playing strongholds and each round gave me 1-3 leggos in gm2 :)"
AnthemTheGame,eq0khpq,t1_eq0ehid,1559686943.0,Pretty much yeah
