I’ve been wondering, our existence was given under this purpose from our parents, does that make supporting the parents our own purpose? Obviously this is mismatched in reality, but I’m alive because of this. It does not matter it get worse for me, if I’m alive for this purpose, I should be here to fulfill it. 

I don’t like the circumstances I’m in just for the safety of my parents. But after reading Bukowski, I’m willing to try the idea that as long as you are alive and trying, there might be hope for me to make my existence my own."
