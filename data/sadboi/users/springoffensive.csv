Anxiety,fcvzq6n,t1_fcv1ygi,1578013802.0,"I have the exact same fears especially as someone who's trying to go into medicine. For me, holding on to a sense of purpose helps. It can be vary from person to person, but I encourage you to think on what you want out of life or what you hope to accomplish. That being said, I'm terrified of my 3rd year which is basically you paying to work full-time and be a student-full time. I worry that I won't make it through and that all of my free time will also be spent studying or doing upkeep chores. If you think about it, so much of each day is maintenance (brushing your teeth, taking a shower, dressing professionally, eating, exercising, sleeping, etc) and the thought of that simply drains my energy. I wonder how ""normal"" people manage to do all that while working AND taking on other major responsibilites like the ones you mentioned in your post."
Anxiety,f9kow4a,t3_e55pek,1575404898.0,"It's crazy how much your story parallels mine. In high school, I had recurrent GI issues and was diagnosed with gastritis despite a normal endoscopy. Over the years, I eventually realized my GI symptoms were a reflection of anxiety, but didn't understand that the acute episodes I was having were panic attacks. I had a complete breakdown when I started my 3rd year of medical school and am currently on a leave of absence to deal with everything. I'm being treated for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder with psychotherapy and medications; I meditate, exercise when I can tolerate being in the gym, and eat nutritiously, but I often find myself lamenting to the universe why I have to live this way. It is torture feeling that you are incapable of going somewhere or doing something because of the fear of an attack (the agoraphobia you mentioned). I have very similar sensations to you when I panic: HR increase, parasthesias (those tingly sensations), hyperstimulation by normal environmental sights, sounds, smells, a sudden urgency to urinate/defecate, and the sense of such an enclosure around myself that I feel the need to escape. The feeling of being trapped/needing an escape basically prevents me from using public transportation (buses, trains, airplanes) or going to crowded public places (restaurants, bars). I almost always have to run to the bathroom to calm down when I panic, but I feel that its not sustainable if I'm to move forward with my life. Anyways, I just wanted to say I wholeheartedly understand what you are going through, I'm struggling to survive myself, and you're free to chat with me about it anytime."

After Re3, Black could play Kg7 threatening to take the rook. White may have Nd5 if dxe3 occurred in order to break through on f6 but it's not necessary to go into these complications as White is up a piece"
