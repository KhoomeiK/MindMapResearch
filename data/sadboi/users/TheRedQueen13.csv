AskWomen,fjjs8qe,t3_fdrwlj,1583410491.0,"Yes it is! I moved to a new city thousands of miles from my friends and family it‚Äôs been incredible lonely. I have my boyfriend of 7 years and he is my best friend but I don‚Äôt really have anyone else. I attend the university here but am 12-15 years older than almost off of my classmates. 

Sometimes I miss meeting a girlfriend for coffee or getting our nails done or grabbing food and drinks.  I miss having someone my age to talk about life, hopes dreams and difficulties. I have become more and more of a homebody, I spend a lot of time studying, working and hanging out with my dog and cats. 

Also sometimes when there is an argument with my boyfriend and I need space to think and calm down. There is no where to go, no friends to call, so I just get more upset and cry in my car before going back and talking with my boyfriend. 

The loneliness is deep and heavy and sometimes I feel like I will drown.

puppy101,fhzargn,t3_f5gm3s,1581994808.0,"We also abandoned the crate when our pup was 8 months old. To be honest, he was never a fan of the crate, to begin with, and putting him in the crate just causes him to freak out. He will try and break out, he would howl, bark, cryand never settled down no matter what, so we abandon the crate.

 There were a few minor issues and some non-important but easy to replace items chewed up in the beginning. He ruined two sets of cheap window blinds, ripped up his bed and ate some books. The more we left him alone for small amounts of time he got better and better. Now he is just over 1 year old and can spend one night a week along for 7 hours. That is the longest he is ever alone.  He does amazing. He has access to the living room and the bedroom only and now has zero issues and doesn't destroy or have accidents at all. 

 I've come to realize that crate training isn't for every dog, he still knows the command for kennel and will go to it but he is never relaxed or feels comfortable in the kennel when he is alone. He is my freedom puppy. 

Your pup might regress a bit when she hits adolescence and may ruin or destroy something but it will pass. Just keep all important, expensive, non-replacable items out of her way."

If your interested in it go in and ask question about the program, what kind of experience and qualifications the trainers have and ask if you can observe a class. 

I would never do a board and train place because you don‚Äôt  learn how to train or work with your dog. But I understand some dogs need that kind of train and there can be some good ones.

You don‚Äôt need to sound so high and mighty and rude about the situation. You don‚Äôt know my dog or the amount of work I have put into his training. Just because he has some issues during certain times doesn‚Äôt mean he has them all the time. He is a very good dog and he loves training.

I do snap at him and get frustrated and I feel so bad and guilty when it happens because he so sweet and kind inside. I do need to work on building his confidence and trust in me. 

Adolescences is awful. We have way more bad days but the good days while few and far between are awesome. I thought the early puppy stage was hard oh man is this time such a struggle."
lexington,f2kit9e,t1_f2k7qtz,1570285997.0,Awesome! We will definitely check out the Barktober fest.
lexington,f2jywzu,t1_f2jxf9e,1570279365.0,"We have been to a number of dog parks but not Fort Boonesboro legacy trail. Need to check it out.

The veg fest might be interesting. Thank you the suggestions."
Anxiety,f15ei47,t3_d7wfv9,1569188951.0,"Because I don‚Äôt have a choice. I have bills to pay, food to buy and a family to support. My pets need supplies and my husband doesn‚Äôt make enough for a single income. I have to work to contribute to our life together.  So it doesn‚Äôt matter how my deplorable anxiety is making me feel, I force myself up and put a smile on my face."
puppy101,f13w7ln,t1_f13cdmn,1569166292.0,This teenage phase is a really trip! I can‚Äôt wait till he‚Äôs over it. I think it‚Äôs more stressful than when he has a baby puppy.
puppy101,f13w1ph,t1_f137og4,1569166222.0,He does love to sleep the morning away. And he is full of energy in the afternoons and evening.
puppy101,f13g5ud,t1_f13dhiy,1569159949.0,"Oh wow, so he can get bigger! I didn‚Äôt realize they grew till that age. Good to know."
puppy101,f136xku,t1_f11iqhw,1569155716.0,He‚Äôs is already pretty big but we always allow are animals to sleep in bed with us. Is he going to get much bigger? He‚Äôs a lab mix and already fixed. I figured at 9-10 months they wouldn‚Äôt grow much more.
puppy101,f136r41,t1_f134869,1569155561.0,"Thank you. You are probably right that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a mix of a number of things. I am also a very light and restless sleeper so it‚Äôs probably annoying for him. 

It‚Äôs just sad to see him sleep with my husband and not cuddle with me. I‚Äôm sure it will get better over time."
Anxiety,f0kl5xs,t3_d56opw,1568681817.0,That‚Äôs sooo me!!!!
Archeology,f0igmak,t3_d50fza,1568641442.0,Will need to get your master at minimum and your PH.D to make any major impact or research in archaeology.
puppy101,ezwgrui,t1_ezw7hcy,1568216319.0,"I agree. I also take mine regularly for the same reasons, plus my pup is more reactive when on a lease so off lease is better for him. Being at the park I am hyper aware of the possibility of a dog attacking mine or a fight breaking out. 

The whole time I‚Äôm at the park, I‚Äôm always looking around at other dogs and their owner and  I always know where my dog is and stay close but also allow him his independence.  I watch body language of the dog and also how the owner interacts with their dog. I have left the park a number of times because I felt like there were dogs that were to, not aggressive but maybe to intense and could potentially become aggressive."
puppy101,ezw0zp7,t3_d2nzv0,1568204753.0,"Im so sorry that happened to you and your puppy. I‚Äôm glad you puppy is alright. Puppies bounce back pretty quickly and often times don‚Äôt seem to bothered by events we find very scary. If your puppy seems fine I would take him again maybe when there are fewer dogs and see how he acts. If your pup seems scared or upset being at the park then you should leave and see about waiting a few days. If your pup seems fine and wanting to play then let him. It‚Äôs often more traumatic for us than the pups. 

There are a lot of mixed feelings on here about dog parks. I take my puppy almost every day to one and have been since he got all his shots and he is now 9 months old and he has never been attacked or had any issues. Other people will tell you they never take their dog because it‚Äôs to risky and events like you experience are common and hard to predict. Unfortunately it is on the owner of the corgi to be responsible for their dog and there isn‚Äôt anything you can do to prevent it from happening. If you see that owner or corgi again you should leave the park to prevent any more incidents from happening again. Or if you have a park department or animal control you can report it."
puppy101,eyi2awn,t1_eyhjjj0,1567096496.0,I do this with people he does it to and he will take treats out of their hand but then goes back to barking at them. Sometimes he will stop on a treat is given but usually not. I also carry his favorite ball so the person he is barking at can play with him. That works a bit better than the treats but I can tell they are uncomfortable with my pup and his barking.
puppy101,eyi21yy,t1_eyhr9ph,1567096377.0,"I have a coworker who is a PoC and my pup is fine with him most of the time. Sometimes he barks but he is familiar enough with my coworker that he doesn‚Äôt bark as often. We don‚Äôt live in a very diverse city or state. So we don‚Äôt have a lot of access to PoC or ethnicity. It‚Äôs very sad. 

We have socialized him since he was 3 months old and he was fine with PoC until about 7 months. We take him to Petsmart a few times a week, go to pet friendly stores, the dog park, and walks..We have done 3 levels of training classes at Petsmart as well."
puppy101,exhrs79,t3_csyo43,1566312601.0,Crate training is different for every dog and owner. My pup didn‚Äôt take to the crate well. It took about 3 months for him to be fully crate trained. He will now willing go to his kennel for a nap or at night but only if we are in the same room.
