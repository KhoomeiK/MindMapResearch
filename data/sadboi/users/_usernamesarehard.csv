pitbulls,fr2y8c7,t3_gm1f3w,1589846207.0,Good luck!! Sending love for you both ❤️
90dayfianceuncensored,fmln3fo,t1_fmk8c9b,1586189596.0,Oh absolutely!
90dayfianceuncensored,fmk3g0l,t1_fmk2p6c,1586143613.0,I didn’t catch that (only 1/2 watching) but I wouldn’t doubt it.
90dayfianceuncensored,fmisur2,t1_fmiqh0s,1586116221.0,"Oh god that’s so messed up & I totally agree! At one time he said “my mother’s a sweetheart!” And while that sentence normally wouldn’t be that weird, the way he said it made me think otherwise. 

I agree Larissa is gross too, the only time I agreed with Colt is when he said “you should respect me” and all she could come up with was that she cleaned the house. Ugh"
90dayfianceuncensored,fmief89,t1_fmide35,1586107934.0,I agree. They tell them they have sooo much money and they’ll buy them anything and they can live the Dream in America! And then someone asks for something that they were promised and they’re suddenly a gold digger and only care about money. Money is one thing you can’t make up & fake!
90dayfianceuncensored,fmi9p4l,t1_fmi9gqv,1586105234.0,"I haven’t seen them yet, but from what I keep seeing it definitely does seem the same"
90dayfianceuncensored,fmi8ejo,t1_fmi77yr,1586104489.0,I love when he got the new car and they played music like he was some big spender 😂
90dayfianceuncensored,fmi8c8m,t1_fmi7gd1,1586104453.0,"Yeaaaah, that’s so horrible. Not only is the age difference unfortunate but he clearly doesn’t see her as an adult based on the way he treats her, which makes it so much yuckier to me"
90dayfianceuncensored,fmi87u6,t1_fmi77u3,1586104384.0,"Ugh yes, her yelling at me with that voice would make my ears bleed. 

Edit: the scene where he kept grabbing her face telling her things would be okay made me SO UNCOMFORTABLE!!"
pitbulls,flzoctk,t3_fs42xk,1585628784.0,My first thought was Mila? Not sure why but here it is
PlusSizeFashionAdvice,fjzk5ux,t3_ffi9il,1583721643.0,You look great!
PrettyLittleLiars,fiirwan,t3_f83227,1582425443.0,"I think you’re thinking of when her parents were having a sober coach live with them? And she fell asleep because he was reading to her ( I think) so her parents made him leave.
I could be wrong but that’s what I thought of!"
AmItheAsshole,f0i4o6r,t3_d4x0zs,1568635995.0,"YTA. As a young woman who’s situation is eerily similar, I can not imagine my dad telling me to choose. It’s not her fault she has another loving father figure, you should be happy she has another man taking care of her and loving her instead of being so jealous. 

My dad has a very similar mind set as you, and it’s strained our relationship for a decade now. Don’t let your own insecurities ruin your relationship with your little girl."
pitbulls,f0ggstc,t3_d4p006,1568599396.0,"My girl is a red nose & was the runt, comes to my knee (I’m 5ft4in) and she weighs in at 50lbs. Girls best friend!"
spiderID,f065wki,t3_d3zp6f,1568430054.0,Thank you!
femalehairadvice,ezll9dp,t3_d1aiof,1567978170.0,I LOVE your style in both pics! So cute
femalehairadvice,eyd1nuu,t1_eyd0ez8,1567009890.0,Maybe also look into a nice brow gel to hold them in place and make them look sleek and fresh!
90DayFiance,ewwtg99,t3_cqfktc,1565834904.0,“Red bag with my makeup!” Is still one of my favorite lines of the show and honestly if a makeup bag like the one here was available I’d buy it in an instant 😂
Degrassi,ewpbgvk,t3_cpf4yg,1565637575.0,The first thing that popped in my head was Spinners voice saying “Ter- you’re pretty” lmao
AmItheAsshole,ewoi164,t3_cpbhg9,1565618518.0,NTA NTA NTA! Parents need to teach their kids how to act around animals and make them understand that just because they’re a pet they’re still a living creature with feelings.
pitbulls,ewoelag,t3_cp3hvu,1565615860.0,I started to cry at work reading this. So sorry for your loss:(
SkincareAddiction,ewnjzu4,t3_coyevc,1565580490.0,"Not on accutane but a sufferer of dry lips! My favorite lip mask for night is the CO Bigelow “my favorite night balm” it’s thick and stays on really well & has a slight sweet smell. I saw someone else mention O’Keefe’s lip balms & I gotta say 10/10 recommend! They have a stick form and a squeeze tube form, both stay on pretty well, have no smell, and actually make a difference!"
OliveMUA,ewc3z6u,t1_ewbzsl1,1565277569.0,Oh I hadn’t thought of this! Thanks for the suggestion!
90DayFiance,ew9etri,t1_ew9amo5,1565224171.0,I’m so glad someone else noticed them 🤦🏻‍♀️
depression,ew2nrge,t3_cmcier,1565051349.0,"I just left a job purely because of this. I came into work a few times upset and not all there as happens when depression is bad & was told to figure it out by tomorrow or find a new job. I decided to just leave because it’s better for me in the long run. Very high stress job & overall not worth it.

Should also mention the job was in the mental health field lol"
self,eve4q73,t1_evc1mex,1564455512.0,"Truthfully I can’t put my finger on it, but there’s something giving me a very bad vibe. There were also a few things I wasn’t informed about until after I had started training & while I get that’s common to not know everything before staring a job, they’re kind of important things. 

I didn’t end up going in today, something important came up. I think I am going to give it a shot, I won’t know unless I try & I’d rather try it and not be there a long time than not try it and regret it. 

Thanks for your response, I truly do appreciate it :)"
depression,erdewm9,t3_c1ekrk,1560739767.0,Omg so glad it’s not just me. Over a year ago my bf left me and I relapsed and barely left my living room floor for weeks.
PrettyLittleLiars,eqsgki8,t1_eqqorkg,1560284414.0,I feel like it really would have thrown us all through a loop & at the same time given a lot of people what they wanted
PrettyLittleLiars,eqnuhbm,t3_bxz7gs,1560180395.0,Charlotte shouldn’t have died & she should have been helping the liars figure out who AD was AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALI
Degrassi,eqh3i2x,t1_eqd0ns3,1560048100.0,Came here to say this lol I’ve watched all from season 1-14
MakeupAddiction,epwsva9,t1_epwspel,1559583877.0,I agree! Maybe a fun wing and a bright lip too
Degrassi,eptwnpw,t1_eptw0l1,1559499111.0,Came here to say this 😂 I’m watching season 12 now and I’m still just waiting for her to get less cringe
MakeupAddiction,epbj0yl,t1_epbhw1z,1559143261.0,"I’ve found that a water proof mascara can help hold a curl better, or you could try warming your eyelash curler before use"
selfcare,ep7uh2b,t3_bu5tru,1559086501.0,"I’ve found with things like this it’s good to gently try to educate, and if they don’t seem to be into that I change the subject. I have a few stubborn people in my family lol and I definitely know what it’s like to try to tell people about something they’re not “used to” and them getting defensive about it."
