For amusement I like to read and take care of my cats.  I can't drink alcohol any more, but weed doesn't interfere with my meds so I do that in moderation.  I live with my elderly parents, so I help them out a lot just with life tasks so that kills some time. 

I'm out of work now, but I've been relatively stable on meds and at the same job for almost 5 years now.  It helps that I started when I had been stable about  8-9 months.  They've never seen me when I'm bad off."

Some days I can barely get out of bed, other days I can't stop cleaning.  I try to stay abreast of the news, just in case there's some new direction from the government, but it's generally totally depressing.  Then I play with my cats or read a book, and kind of forget myself and the coronavirus, and I'm happy.  Then I snap back to reality and end up depressed again.

I can't count the times I've thought in the last few days ""I am not a sane person."" But I think it's being markedly exacerbated by the virus and isolation."

Everything you say tracks with my experiences generally.  As I got older (early thirties) I started cycling more rapidly and drinking heavily, both of which progressed and ended up as recurrent mixed states until I finally ended up inpatient where I got diagnosed and began the climb...
And hypersexuality can certainly be a sign of mania.
But definitely be honest with a professional.  That'd be way more helpful.  Good luck"
bipolar,fqytyl1,t3_glfavz,1589754509.0,"*trigger warning* 
Yeah guy, it's called being nuts.  No worries, I'm nuts too.  The key is to find a psychiatrist/psychologist to get a diagnosis, meds, therapy, etc...   That will usually help most people (myself included) get within shouting distance of ""normal.""   Not perfection, but definitely better.  And if you are doing all that, reach out to your providers, or find new ones.  Either way professionals need to be consulted.
And for real STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS & ALCOHOL!  It may feel good short term, but you are setting yourself up for long term brain dysfunction.  And I hear huffing can cause respiratory failure on the spot.  Please take care of yourself and good luck."

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Staff Sergeant Carlos N. Hathcock, II (MCSN: 1873109), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Sniper, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division, in connection with military operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam on 16 September 1969. Staff Sergeant Hathcock was riding on an Assault Amphibious Vehicle which ran over and detonated an enemy anti-tank mine, disabling the vehicle which was immediately engulfed in flames. He and other Marines who were riding on top of the vehicle were sprayed with flaming gasoline caused by the explosion. Although suffering from severe burns to his face, trunk, and arms and legs, Staff Sergeant Hathcock assisted the injured Marines in exiting the burning vehicle and moving to a place of relative safety. With complete disregard for his own safety and while suffering excruciating pain from his burns, he bravely ran back through the flames and exploding ammunition to ensure that no Marines had been left behind in the burning vehicle. His heroic actions were instrumental in saving the lives of several Marines. By his courage, aggressive leadership, and total devotion to duty in the face of extreme personal danger, Staff Sergeant Hathcock reflected great credit upon himself and the Marine Corps and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

tl;dr Years later he was in a vehicle that got blown up and in the aftermath he saved a bunch of Marines while ignoring his own significant burn injuries."
