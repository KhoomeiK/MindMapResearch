In a high quality team, you should have a mix of people with varying professional and life experiences.

Like most young companies, they shun older people (probably anyone over 35) and therfore are missing out on valuable experience from someone (s) that have gone through this before and knows what works and what doesn't.

I'm also willing to bet that the company culture is to not encourgae debate out of fear of losing your job.

Feeling safe enough to sleep well is important to little ones. 

I have 5 kids and I never let them cry it out, all but one.

Four of them are well-adjusted and secure individuals. The one we did let cry it out. Not so much. He doesn't like being cuddled. He's very introverted compared to his siblings. He doesn't accept help or ask for help as easily as his brothers and sister.

I suspected something was up becuse in the weeks leading up to her leaving I caught her sexting to an ex-bf, she was spending the night often at her ""girlfriends"" house.

Do not hire a cheap photographer. 

But you also don't have to spend a ton of money either.

A decent photographer, with average skill, about 125 to 150 USD for 1 or 1.5 hour session. 

Vet them based on their website portfolio. A halfway decent photographer that is looking to make money should have one.

At the very least  they should have a FB page or IG account you can browse.

Don't settle for cheap, you get what you pay for, trust me. Find a photographer that has a style you like. Meet first at a coffee shop or some other place, see what she/he like. If you feel good and they make you comfortable, AND you like their portfolio, then go forward. 

Never pay up front. Pay when the product is delivered. Most photographers don't give you the RAW photos so don't ask. If they do give them to you, it would make me wonder about their skill level as the majority of photogrpahers trying to make it are well aware of what handing over RAW files mean.

Finally, tell them right off the bat that you need photos for social media and OLD sites. A good one will know exactly what you need.

Good luck!"

Labs, ultrasounds and fibroscans are useful tools but they can only tell you that there is at minimum scarring. But none of those can tell you for certain how advanced the scarring is. 

The only way is a tissue sample and examination by a pathologist.

I was initially diagnosed with cirrohsis but it was downgraded to S3 Fibrosis. 

My last recommendation is to find a hepatologist. A lot of folks on here are seeing gastro doctors; however, that's like seeing a general practitioner to evaluate a serious heart condition. See a hepatologist, liver is their speciality.
