fuckeatingdisorders,fr0jmlk,t3_glud63,1589798008.0,"I suffered of anorexia for some time. My bf has been the one who managed to heal me basically, where everyone else failed. He has been so supportive, patient, and even seeing him angry and super worried when I wasn't eating helped a lot. 
I just accepted I wanted to be happy for real with him. His great love taught me to love myself again and made it possible. My ed is fading away slowly and thanks to him I managed to accept that having some curves on my body is amazing. 
Love is very powerful. It worked more than antidepressants, therapy and all what I tried before starting living with him. He is super proud of me and honestly it just feels so good to be able to eat and enjoy also this part of life with him.
There has been hard moments where I was going crazy thinking I would have just became fat, and I didn't . He was there, holding me tight while I was crying .
It will be hard but his love will make you love yourself again slowly. 
I wish you all the best and please text me if you need to talk! I know how hard can be but I believe in you!"
