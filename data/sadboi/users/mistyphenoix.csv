endometriosis,fjadxff,t3_fcddr5,1583171516.0,"Youre not alone. Ive been dealing with unbearable agony since i started my period at 14. It got even worse when i turned 18. Ive been on so many high doses of pain relief and contraceptives, in fact i stopped my contraceptive yesterday. I havent been diagnosed but have gone through gastro and everything had been ruled out, had multiple blood tests and everything is FINE. My doctors immediately said â€˜theres no point checking gynaeâ€™. I worry that even if i did see them and get a laparoscopy that nothing would show up. At the end of the day your pain is valid, no matter what a doctor says. You shouldnt have to just put up with that agony, its NOT normal and there is a reason behind it. You just have to trust that the doctors etc will be smart enough to understand the complexities of endometriosis and other gynae related conditions. I really hope the laparoscopy shows something just so you can get help! All the best ðŸ’–ðŸ’–"

I cant take any NSAIDs. Gels or tablets or anything, they set off a massive asthma attack!
I have gabapentin and amitriptyline from tenosynovitis and im tempted to try those but im not sure."

The other day I was doing an essay and wanted a stapler and plain paper and they werent where i left them. I tried to calm myself and forget it but i could feel myself getting more and more anxious. I eventually had to get up (it was 1am) and wake my mum up so we could unpack tons of boxes to find it otherwise I would have had a major breakdown.
Its so so irritating, especially when others donâ€™t understand and get annoyed"
Dreams,fcrb3l6,t3_eiftfk,1577899386.0,I used to have recurring dreams of a guy running throughout my school on a motorbike shooting people. It was exactly the same every time I had it. Id wake up terrified
UnresolvedMysteries,fcq2sjp,t1_fcpew26,1577877485.0,"Im saying no parent can know exactly what the â€˜childâ€™ thinks. Her parents were overbearing and almost suffocating. She had already been lying about her whereabouts unsurprisingly, so her running away is pretty believable. Lots of people run away. 
Its also not out of the realm of possibility that her suffocating parents could have done something."
AskReddit,fcp498d,t3_ei9bm3,1577849992.0,"Definitely.
I have ASD and no friends or family so I never feel human contact. Sometimes I just get a want for a hug or to hold a hand or something. Im not good at switching the feeling off and so usually it turns into depression."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcooum5,t1_fcomv7z,1577837652.0,"Thats so bizarre. I live in the town and theres posters on bridges, in every shop, some people have them in their cars and house windows. There was a massive argument about the Â£5000 reward. A man offered like Â£15000 and the police refused."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcokuiz,t1_fcoitw0,1577834771.0,"Well the family until recently had hope she was alive, but since her brother killed himself, they said she wouldve done anything to go to his funeral so they now believe shes dead.
A lot of people have assumed shes dead for months now. Just taken on her route to work or from meeting someone who killed her.
I just dont get a good feeling about her family at all"
UnresolvedMysteries,fco1zv8,t1_fcnz4qb,1577822619.0,"She definitely does. I never trust parents that say those things anyway. I tend to suspect overwhelming parents as well. 

Her brother supposedly had conversations with his parents about leah just before his death, how he felt guilty/worried etc. It was just a theory I ran over with my mum seeing as its the talk of the town. 

The whole relationship thing is so bizarre. Makes you wonder if she met up with someone who did something. The fact theres been 0 trace of her since that morning is utterly bizarre, then again MK is huge and theres so much green land."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcnw3pb,t1_fcnuz9y,1577819609.0,"I agree, her mothers overwhelmingly involvement in leahs life is... weird to say the least.

In regards to her brother harassing the man; that could be him following orders from the family who were/are all suspicious of the man. Either that or trying to find something on the man/ pushing him to confess to something he didnt do. Who knows. Its all very strange."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcnrpp2,t3_ei3hp2,1577817161.0,"I remember when this story started, I live in the same town and am roughly the same age as her. I remember the first thing I said to my mother was that I thought her brother did it ( I said it jokingly) or that she could be like an older maddie case and her parents had killed her.
When it was reported her brother had committed suicide it made me think more about the possibility it was her brother. No evidence whatsoever, I know, but its possible. 
Her parents continually say she would never leave without telling them, but supposedly she was doing many things her parents didnt know about, and claims like that by the parents are always bullshit."
