What do you plan to do about chem practical  though  , that's one part I'm concerned about too 😣😣."
SGExams,fo5nbf4,t3_g5ns8n,1587530022.0," Fellow private candidate here .... I'm in the SAME EXACT POSITION AS YOU except I probably did much worse. You can find home tutors at (smiletutors.sg) or (nanyang academics) , dont worry I'm 100 percent sure that the online tuition would be feasible for you , if anything it might be better and less daunting without the tutor directly staring into your soul while you do your work 😂. Group tuitions are also there if that's what you  prefer , personally I'm attending a group tuition for maths it's quite good he teaches us online and then gives us hw which we submit through WhatsApp and then he corrects it and gives back. You can also stay back to ask questions. 

Retaking is a very difficult decision and I know it's very hard everyday you'll be filled with sheer  uncertainty on whether you can make it. Sometimes the only thing you feel like doing  is just lying down and crying your eyes out but don't give up this might be a blessing in disguise. Another year for us to learn from our mistakes and to try harder. 

If it helps know that you're not alone. There are in fact many people like you and me who retake. I read here on reddit SG exams of a private candidate who got straight Us at his first attempt and then eventually ended up getting 90 rank points with his second. The key is not ever  to give up.  

What is your study method for now and if you dont mind me asking what's your subject combi?"

Right now things may seem a little hazy but tell you a thing mate not one person in this world has their life figured even if they do life always finds way to divert our plans. That’s okay not everything in life has to be sorted out with a plan. Sometimes it’s a different route but the destination will always be the same. 

Perhaps what you need right is a lot of rest and support. If you feel that your mental health maybe be deteriorating or that you feel dejected please consult a therapist. MI offers a wide array of opportunities. Moreover you have an ample amount of time to prepare for your A levels. Plus the pace is rather adequate, just right for you to grasp the concepts and even clarify your doubts. 

Doesn’t matter whatever your O level score was , there are people who barely managed to scrape 20 points and ended with full on distinctions in A levels . Whatever happened is in the past, you will move on to do great things in life. Ten years, hell even 5 years from now you won’t worry about what happened now. Yes painful memories leave scars but they will heal overtime. Whatever happens don’t give up, life is a tough journey but you are even more stronger for being able to go through it. I believe you can do this. Focus on your dreams and passions , find your purpose. I hope your things get better for you. Proud of you for hanging in there. Pain is temporary, it is just quite good with it’s illusive nature of tricking us into thinking that whatever we are facing  is a major problem when it isn’t. Don’t  fall for its tricks.  You have a lot to live for, so much things to accomplish and you’ve come this far what’s one more :D! Hang in there buddy you’ll get through this!"

So don’t he too disheartened, they will be there for you. Plus you guys can probably enter the same university together right? There are also so many holidays in between for you guys to  enjoy. Don’t lose hope true friends never leave you behind. I’ve had friends who still go out with their primary school mates( didn’t even know that it was a thing but oh well ) so yeah :) as much as life takes away it also gives back so cheer up mate :D for better days are coming your way!

SGExams,feqbvnd,t3_eqebig,1579339955.0,"Hey look at me you are going to be okay. Are you still able to enter ITE?? You can still enter ITE and get into your preferred courses. This is not the end, although I know it might feel like you just lost your footing  but this part of your life is going to change. Before you know it ,you are going to progress into higher institutions and do greater things and you’ll look back and O levels will be nothing. I suggest ( totally up to you) that you continue studying especially these days tertiary qualifications are very significant for jobs. Another option is to retake o levels although it is very rigorous but I believe if you do it one more time you can definitely do extremely well. Also 46 is L1R5 mah still got your L1R4. You see it’s a cliche story but Jack Ma failed so many times , he was beat down completely but his will to succeed made him a millionaire. You can do it, 10 years down the road your results wont matter. Take this time to heal and find happiness. Think about your passion and what you like doing. There are also university foundation programmes  that you can apply to.Dont lose faith in yourself, you are more than your grades. Like bro there’s literally so much more to you as a person. Your attitude is what makes a difference although your aptitude is also somewhat important.  

For the time being you can work part time,  if working is really what you want to do. There are still a countless number of jobs available.  Whatever you do, stay strong. I’m proud of you regardless, you made it through O levels and that itself is an accomplishment. I hope you’ll do great things in life. Sorry if I wasn’t of much help. 💪Hang in there mah dude  :D"

Holy shiet Heisenberg. You seem really passionate and looks like the person who can talk about your hobbies for hours. You are a really interesting person. Your personality outweighs all other factors. 

Also seems like you have an eloquent taste in music. You are stronger than you know and you have more potential than you might think. Im so sorry that you’ve been bullied there are so many cruel people in this world. But hate and anger is always a secondary emotion. Those who bully have their own insecurities and all they want to do is project it own someone they know they can take advantage of. Don’t succumb to their harsh words. I know it’s hard but I need you to seek help. Bullying is a very important thing. Please talk to a therapist, you may have anxiety and the low self confidence might be a result of all the bullying. Also let me tell you right now in your teenage years is where you discover the most about yourself. This is the time where you have  gruelling thoughts about life , your individuality etc. So take this time to discover your passion. Also if you feel like you are socially awkward there are so many freelance stay at home jobs that you can do in the comfort of your home. 

I’m so proud that you have triumphed through all these years. Looking at you makes me think of my ownself. Don’t push yourself down. You have to radiate the kindness and love inside you. Take the good parts of life as memories and the bad parts as lessons. You have a wonderful personality.  You’ll graduate high school splendidly. You need to trust in yourself. Life is always changing nothing will be constant. Trust me, it will get better. We all take time to bloom. One day you’ll find people who share your interests and things you like and you’ll feel content. Dont give up on yourself , or at least believe in me who believes in you. All the best in life. You can do this. Feel free to talk"
toastme,fecaz8b,t3_eod3ri,1578969866.0,"First things first it is important that you don’t beat yourself over your mistakes. It doesn’t matter what’ve done. The thing about life is it offers second chances and third and a million other chances. Right now you may feel stuck and tired of trying, you may think very poorly of yourself but you don’t realise the potential you have. It’s not too late. There have been people going to uni at 80, people getting married to their loved ones finally at 60, people becoming millionaires at 16 . Age doesn’t matter. We all take time to bloom and wither and bloom again. You may feel powerless but you do have the power to change this. Thing about your life, im not asking you  to plan out your entire future but think about what you are going to do tomorrow and how it’s different from what you’ve done today. Be a better version of yourself everyday. 

None of us here are saints, we have all made mistakes and will continue to make them but the important thing is to learn from them. Im so proud of you, at least you are seeking help. Perhaps the first thing you could work on is probably getting a degree on something you might be interested in or perhaps you can do part time jobs and earn some good money to support yourself. Immerse yourself im hobbies and do things you like. 

If you are depressed I suggest that you talk to a trusted friend, family or a therapist because if you let it be it might turn out disastrous. So seek help for your mental health. It’s very important.

 Lastly bout love , you’ll find love. True love takes time, you’ll know because there is a specific warmth associated with being in love. Have you tried dating websites? Take your time to discover more about yourself and your aspirations. You are in control, dont feel beat down by all the pressure. I believe in you, and you are going to do amazing things. Hang in there buddy. Proud of you for coming this far. Life is a journey so embrace it while it lasts. All the best and do update us :)!"

Things are not going to be easy perhaps they moght become even more tough but there will be silver lining. We take the good parts of life and add it to our collection of memories and take the bad parts as important guiding principles. Suicide is a very stressful experience, I’ve gone through it. I’m sure you must have been very stressed and sad. It takes a lot of effort to end it all, just sitting in a room and crying incessantly about everything, feeling your life flash before you. 

Please get continuous therapy okay ??? Mental health is very important. I hope you have a trusted friend or a family member to talk with. The key is to talk and receive  the necessary help you need. You might need to consult psychiatrists or psychologists in case you feel like you still have a pending problem or a traumatising situation or just depression in general. Please seek help :D.

Congratulations on your job. So proud of you. I hope life rewards you generously. Pain is temporary and it will pass. So stay strong( I know it’s not easy but I know you are trying your best).

Next thing is to continuously send applications to companies that you are interested in.

You may also wish to look at payscale to see the average remuneration for your job. Aim to send at least 10 proposals a day. You’ll definitely be called in. I know it’s hard but at least you are trying and that’s all that matters. There are so many opportunities in this world. I really hope you’ll find one that resonates most with you. 

Also please take care of your mental health, it is very important. Try to indulge in your hobbies and perhaps volunteer or do part time jobs till you find the stable  full time job that you wish for.  We take the good times of life as memories and the bad times( or the not so good times) as lessons to learn from. Life is a journey so enjoy it to the fullest while you can.

toastme,fec7d0i,t3_eoeb2j,1578967916.0,"You are really not ugly. Besides looks is not what matters. If your personality is pleasant, people would appreciate you nevertheless. It sucks that people  say harsh and demeaning things. Beauty is really in the eye of the beholder. You look handsome actually ( I think everyone is handsome and beautiful) ,like first of all I really don’t understand why anyone would judge by looks but I guess each to their own so I can’t criticise them.  Just curious who are these people who call you ugly? You have really nice eyes and an adorable childlike face. How can you be ugly??!Like it’s beyond me?

toastme,fec6nxt,t1_fec300d,1578967550.0,"Sometimes it is better to break up than they stay in a relationship where there is no chemistry and love and even worse when there is manipulation and other emotional abuse. I’m happy that you got out of a toxic relationship. Although cheating on you   when he could have just told you he wanted to break up  was quite immature and indecent on his side but we also have to be balanced and look at both sides. I’m so happy for you, you will find great people. People who will share your perks and quirks. People who will love you for all your jokes, things you love and just have deep conversations. When you find true love you’ll know because there will just be a certain warmth that you feel. ❤️You need to forgive ( I know it’s not easy) but forgiving would help you move on. Once you forgive you need to forget which also takes a lot of time.This would help you heal. Don’t hold grudges against both of them. Forgiving doesn’t mean you are losing out , it just means you are more courageous and rational and most of all mature. 

Second about your coursework. Art is a very gruelling but rewarding subject. The reason why you may be falling behind is because you may be very depressed and your mental health may be suffering. When we feel sad we often tend to procrastinate or push things for later. You mentioned about your best friend, maybe you can talk out your problems with a trusted friend, family members or even a good therapist. I’m so proud of you nonetheless because even though things are hard you are still trying. Really grateful that your best friend is helping you. Just take one step at a time. Perhaps if you spend 4 hours everyday with breaks in between and do it consecutively for 10 days you’ll be able to finish your project. You’ll get through this. Try to use art to express whatever you are feeling inside, then it won’t seem like much of a chore. May I ask , what type of art are you referring to? :) 

Also I really with the best for you.You are trying your best so dont push yourself down.We take the good parts of life and use it for the memories and the bad parts( or the not so good parts) as lessons. You’ve come a long way so don’t give up. Talk to your teacher, and request that you be given more time. If she is caring enough she’ll understand. ❤️Stay strong 💪"

SGExams,febx2m3,t3_eo7567,1578963715.0,"Pretty sad that you thought of poly nursing as a dumping ground :( . Nursing has a lof of career progression and it requires a lot of passion. Not everyone can do it. You have to work for long hours and sometimes you are not even remunerated enough. Plus the gruelling shifts would make you extremely fatigued. But what would keep you going is the burning passion to help people. You seem like a nice person so I assume that you were fed these misconceptions through your family members or otherwise. Nursing is so much more than it is thought to be and to degrade it is very irrational and narrow minded. At the end of the day when you are direly sick , there’ll only be a nurse to nurture you and offer you comfort. 
Nurses and doctors are totally two different occupations. Mind you, nurses are not doctors’ assistants they are the ones interacting with patients perhaps 10x more than the doctor. Some nurses including chief nurses are paid heftily so do keep an open mind :). 


With that said I suggest that you try a JC instead it’s not good to enter something halfheartedly. Also do note that nursing and medicine are TWO DIFFERENT COMPETENCIES, so I suggest if it’s medicine you’d like to pursue then you might choose to enter JC or poly Biomedical Science. I’ve never heard of anyone go to poly nursing and then became a doctor, maybe there is but you can go research if you are adamant about it. 

Last note is keep an open mind. Every job has its ups and downs. Let’s not diminish the value of our passions and jobs. Ask yourself why you really want to pursue medicine is it cause of the passion or just the money( which is totally okay if that’s what you want) because even being a doctor requires sleepless nights, very good precision and also a strong heart to deal with all sorts of situations."

mentalhealth,f7ddp04,t3_dvl50d,1573614049.0,"That is so f**king sad, YOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS. Tell your mother that her life is precious. Sit down with her and tell her how much she means to you. Tell her she has a lot to live for like seeing you graduate, seeing you and your brother get married, she deserves to see beautiful places she has never met before, and enjoy the bliss of listening to retro music, playing with your grandkids etc. 

Please advise your angel of a mother to leave her job. She doesn’t deserve to be mistreated like that. There are so many employment options out there. I know it’s not easy but staying around people who constantly criticise your mom is going to severely affect her mental health.  Also talk with your brother and explain to him the situation if possible :), advice him to be more kinder to your mom. 

I understand that your brother has some problems as well ( poor thing ❤️) Does he go for therapy? Talk to him about his problems. Let him know you are there for him. The reason why he argues is because he has so much anger and pain inside him that he just has to get it out and sadly he gets it out on your mother. Help him get treatment or therapy. 

Since two of your family members are at high risk of suicide, I really suggest that you if you can, bring them to a psychologist. They need to get the proper help to better deal with stress.Depending on your location there might be free mental health services available. 

Also do urge your mother and brother to contact mental health hotlines. I was on the verge of suicide, and I talked to a hotline. All they did was listen and that was all I needed. Sometimes talking to a stranger about our problems can really help. 


About your aunt, if it’s difficult to talk about the situation with  her, then I suggest you try to avoid your mother from conversing with her as much as possible. Tell her you aunt if possible about the things your mother is going through. Is it possible to relocate your aunt? 

I know that you are caught in the middle of all this too. Don’t lose yourself amidst all this chaos. It will pass, life is a lesson. Please consult a psychiatrist if possible.

I hope everything gets better. Please take care of yourself too. You problems are valid and feel free to talk about them anyday, anywhere."

lonely,f6of4rt,t3_dsarv9,1573015729.0,"Man this is the most relatable thing I have come across , I know everyone says personality is what matters but really nobody even bothers to get to know you if you ain’t pretty. 

But then again there’s a silver lining. Sometimes people ( although very few) really do consider  personality. I really cant imagine connecting with someone who doesn’t have a good personality. 

It’s really horrible that you feel that you are unattractive. Don’t recite it to yourself all the time. You seem like a really cool person in touch with their emotions. You come off as a bold person to me and that to me is sexy. You don’t deserve all the hate. Beauty isn’t constant. You find flowers beautiful but you also find glow in the dark stickers stunning, but they dont look anything like each other. Beauty manifests itself in many forms and I know society makes us think otherwise but really inner beauty is more crucial than  external aesthetics. 

You need to slowly love yourself. When you love yourself you’ll radiate confidence and that would attract people to you. Plus let me tell you dear, beauty will fade but personality would never EVER FADE. All those people who are loving you solely for beauty they are not in love with you they are in love with pretty things. 


I wish I can show you how amazing you are. Look, I already want to talk to you and be you friend and I’ve never even met you. Trust me there are so many people out there who would kill to have someone like you.

OP you seem like a wise and thoughtful person. Maybe you might think of demeaning things about yourself but what I  see is a bold and confident person staying strong despite their hardest times. It takes a lot of strength to hold on to life even when you are at your worst and for that hats off to you OP. You are doing more than you think. Love is all around us, we just have to let it come through. Give and receive love from unconventional things like your pet, a blooming plant, an old grandma at a nursing home, an intriguing book, sumptuous food, making a baby smile at a supermarket etc. I really hope you get better OP. I hope you’ll find someone as amazing as you. All the best in your future endeavours, you’ll go on to do great things in life. Hang in there okay and dont EVER BE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT.

Wish I could be you friend. You see, like Paulo Coelho said in Alchemist , When you really want something the universe conspires in getting it for you. It will take time but you’ll surely find someone. You seem like a really mature and wise person and I bet there are many people out there who wish that they can find a person like you. 

I deal with loneliness too on a daily basis, and I  hate it. However slowly I began to find ways to cope with my loneliness. Do you like pets? Animals are great companions if you are interested. You may also try nurturing plants. When you feel the need to take care of something, it gives you a purpose. Focus more on your hobbies, things you love doing. I know everywhere you go you see people with company and friends, but take it one step at a time and try to embrace the loneliness and channel it into confidence. Talk to a therapist, loneliness can be a MAJOR PROBLEM OF YOU DON’T seek HELP right away. Dont shy away from speaking out about your loneliness like you did ( I’m so proud of you for doing that). You can also try volunteering if you like to help people. Depending on where you live, you may also wish to foster or adopt children if you are fond of kids. Searching for a romantic partner in a dating site may be helpful. You are still very young, take your time to go on dates and explore your likes and dislikes. That being said I know loneliness is not as easy to get over as we presume it to be. In fact it takes a lot of courage. So take it slow, everything you do is an accomplishment. ❤️

Also I’m really fudging sorry about the passing of your dear friends. Don’t beat yourself over it, they met you, they made great memories with you and now they are just enjoying eternal peace and moving on to another phase in life.  They are never really gone until you forget them, and they’ll live on in your heart. Are there group talk sessions about losing loved ones near your area? Talk about it okay, don’t keep this pain to yourself. 


I hope you find your peace and have an amazing family in the future. Things will get better, they always do or at least we become stronger and more capable of dealing with our problems. Your problems are valid, thus dont be afraid to speak up. There are more people than you think in the world who are willing to stay up all night listening  to you and comforting you. I know this might not have helped. I really wish  you have a fantastic life ahead. You have important milestones to conquer. Don’t give up for this too shall pass. Hang in there :)"

wholesomememes,f5sikfi,t1_f5pqskg,1572432184.0,"To be honest I feel you because I’m unattractive af too but, dont worry it’s really fine if someone doesn’t get attracted to us. Yes loneliness hurts.    
: ((((((  but then again being single also means more time to spend with ourselves, do the things we love, the only validation we need is from ourselves. Like I go to the movies alone, eat at restaurants alone. At first I hated it but then I got used to it, and now I love it. 

Attraction is also subjective, while it is hard to believe and accept : beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 

You seem like a nice person. You never know :)! If you do find someone, that’s awesome if you don’t it’s still okay. 

Have a great life bro/sis ! Please don’t be too hard on yourself, you deserve good things! All the very best :D stay safe and healthy."

If he really loves you, he should be appreciative of what he has. This ain’t right Queen. Talk to him ya, tell him how you feel but if it isn’t working I suggest you break it off. He seems really controlling. You don’t need that kind of negativity in your life >~<! Give us an update love and take care."

nursing,epxesbg,t1_epx6v6l,1559598907.0,"I’m going to show this to my parents and let them know what they really become when they look down in nursing. Exactly there is nothing shameful about nursing, it is a very noble profession with a lot of opportunities to research, be a lecturer or continue as a clinical nurse. Nursing is a holistic career and you learn so many values and skills. I seek an apology on behalf of my parents, thank you so much for motivating me. ❤️ God bless you :)!"
nursing,epxehcc,t1_epx6pcq,1559598694.0,"that is really very insightful , one component I missed out in my research is exploring the nursing opportunities in other countries, perhaps I can use this to show my parents that nursing can be a very adaptable job. 

Heck even I might show the whole thread , and show them what everybody else thinks, maybe that would change their minds for good. 

thank you :))) 💕"
nursing,epxe65z,t1_epx7ddz,1559598474.0,"I am ever so grateful for your help❤️, thank you so much for letting me know about this crucial information. When I  was researching I only found put the salary to be $3000 SGD which is a very sustainable amount for me and I was satisfied with it but when I presented it to my parents all the commotion began about how it’s too low and things like that. Even though for many other jobs the starting salary revolves around $3000 SGD. They are really just biased. I’ll present this information to them next year when I collect my A level results. thanks again :)"
nursing,epxdp09,t1_epw9mrj,1559598137.0,"I REALLY NEEDED THIS ❤️ what you said is very accurate many a times when I felt like giving in to their demands , I felt very powerless and vengeful of my family. Nursing is the only thing I have ever been so passionate about and I can’t give up on it no matter what. 

When my A level results are posted I will sit down and have a conversation with them and convey to them the information about nursing I’ve gathered and either resolve it in a pleasant manner or if they are still not convinced I’m just going to take matters into my own hand and apply for nursing. Maybe my parents disapproval could be a thunderstorm before the rainbow. thank you :”)"
nursing,epxd2ht,t1_epwh8il,1559597700.0,"It is , my parents are first generation migrants who came to singapore and they have are very grounded in their cultural roots.

It’s just very hard when people who are supposed to support your dreams turn their back on you. Thanks again❤️ for making me a tat  bolder , I just need to be more firm in my morals."
