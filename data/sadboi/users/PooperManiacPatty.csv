SGExams,fo5nbf4,t3_g5ns8n,1587530022.0," Fellow private candidate here .... I'm in the SAME EXACT POSITION AS YOU except I probably did much worse. You can find home tutors at (smiletutors.sg) or (nanyang academics) , dont worry I'm 100 percent sure that the online tuition would be feasible for you , if anything it might be better and less daunting without the tutor directly staring into your soul while you do your work üòÇ. Group tuitions are also there if that's what you  prefer , personally I'm attending a group tuition for maths it's quite good he teaches us online and then gives us hw which we submit through WhatsApp and then he corrects it and gives back. You can also stay back to ask questions. 

Retaking is a very difficult decision and I know it's very hard everyday you'll be filled with sheer  uncertainty on whether you can make it. Sometimes the only thing you feel like doing  is just lying down and crying your eyes out but don't give up this might be a blessing in disguise. Another year for us to learn from our mistakes and to try harder. 

If it helps know that you're not alone. There are in fact many people like you and me who retake. I read here on reddit SG exams of a private candidate who got straight Us at his first attempt and then eventually ended up getting 90 rank points with his second. The key is not ever  to give up.  

What is your study method for now and if you dont mind me asking what's your subject combi?"

Right now things may seem a little hazy but tell you a thing mate not one person in this world has their life figured even if they do life always finds way to divert our plans. That‚Äôs okay not everything in life has to be sorted out with a plan. Sometimes it‚Äôs a different route but the destination will always be the same. 

Perhaps what you need right is a lot of rest and support. If you feel that your mental health maybe be deteriorating or that you feel dejected please consult a therapist. MI offers a wide array of opportunities. Moreover you have an ample amount of time to prepare for your A levels. Plus the pace is rather adequate, just right for you to grasp the concepts and even clarify your doubts. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter whatever your O level score was , there are people who barely managed to scrape 20 points and ended with full on distinctions in A levels . Whatever happened is in the past, you will move on to do great things in life. Ten years, hell even 5 years from now you won‚Äôt worry about what happened now. Yes painful memories leave scars but they will heal overtime. Whatever happens don‚Äôt give up, life is a tough journey but you are even more stronger for being able to go through it. I believe you can do this. Focus on your dreams and passions , find your purpose. I hope your things get better for you. Proud of you for hanging in there. Pain is temporary, it is just quite good with it‚Äôs illusive nature of tricking us into thinking that whatever we are facing  is a major problem when it isn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt  fall for its tricks.

This is not the end, although I know it might feel like you just lost your footing  but this part of your life is going to change. Before you know it ,you are going to progress into higher institutions and do greater things and you‚Äôll look back and O levels will be nothing. I suggest ( totally up to you) that you continue studying especially these days tertiary qualifications are very significant for jobs. Another option is to retake o levels although it is very rigorous but I believe if you do it one more time you can definitely do extremely well. Also 46 is L1R5 mah still got your L1R4. You see it‚Äôs a cliche story but Jack Ma failed so many times , he was beat down completely but his will to succeed made him a millionaire. You can do it, 10 years down the road your results wont matter. Take this time to heal and find happiness. Think about your passion and what you like doing. There are also university foundation programmes  that you can apply to.Dont lose faith in yourself, you are more than your grades. Like bro there‚Äôs literally so much more to you as a person. Your attitude is what makes a difference although your aptitude is also somewhat important.  

For the time being you can work part time,  if working is really what you want to do. There are still a countless number of jobs available.  Whatever you do, stay strong.

Holy shiet Heisenberg. You seem really passionate and looks like the person who can talk about your hobbies for hours. You are a really interesting person. Your personality outweighs all other factors. 

Also seems like you have an eloquent taste in music. You are stronger than you know and you have more potential than you might think. Im so sorry that you‚Äôve been bullied there are so many cruel people in this world. But hate and anger is always a secondary emotion. Those who bully have their own insecurities and all they want to do is project it own someone they know they can take advantage of. Don‚Äôt succumb to their harsh words. I know it‚Äôs hard but I need you to seek help. Bullying is a very important thing. Please talk to a therapist, you may have anxiety and the low self confidence might be a result of all the bullying. Also let me tell you right now in your teenage years is where you discover the most about yourself. This is the time where you have  gruelling thoughts about life , your individuality etc. So take this time to discover your passion. Also if you feel like you are socially awkward there are so many freelance stay at home jobs that you can do in the comfort of your home. 

I‚Äôm so proud that you have triumphed through all these years. Looking at you makes me think of my ownself. Don‚Äôt push yourself down. You have to radiate the kindness and love inside you. Take the good parts of life as memories and the bad parts as lessons. You have a wonderful personality.  You‚Äôll graduate high school splendidly. You need to trust in yourself. Life is always changing nothing will be constant. Trust me, it will get better. We all take time to bloom.

toastme,fecaz8b,t3_eod3ri,1578969866.0,"First things first it is important that you don‚Äôt beat yourself over your mistakes. It doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôve done. The thing about life is it offers second chances and third and a million other chances. Right now you may feel stuck and tired of trying, you may think very poorly of yourself but you don‚Äôt realise the potential you have. It‚Äôs not too late. There have been people going to uni at 80, people getting married to their loved ones finally at 60, people becoming millionaires at 16 . Age doesn‚Äôt matter. We all take time to bloom and wither and bloom again. You may feel powerless but you do have the power to change this. Thing about your life, im not asking you  to plan out your entire future but think about what you are going to do tomorrow and how it‚Äôs different from what you‚Äôve done today. Be a better version of yourself everyday. 

None of us here are saints, we have all made mistakes and will continue to make them but the important thing is to learn from them. Im so proud of you, at least you are seeking help. Perhaps the first thing you could work on is probably getting a degree on something you might be interested in or perhaps you can do part time jobs and earn some good money to support yourself. Immerse yourself im hobbies and do things you like. 

If you are depressed I suggest that you talk to a trusted friend, family or a therapist because if you let it be it might turn out disastrous. So seek help for your mental health. It‚Äôs very important.

 Lastly bout love , you‚Äôll find love. True love takes time, you‚Äôll know because there is a specific warmth associated with being in love. Have you tried dating websites? Take your time to discover more about yourself and your aspirations. You are in control, dont feel beat down by all the pressure. I believe in you, and you are going to do amazing things. Hang in there buddy. Proud of you for coming this far. Life is a journey so embrace it while it lasts. All the best and do update us :)!"

Things are not going to be easy perhaps they moght become even more tough but there will be silver lining. We take the good parts of life and add it to our collection of memories and take the bad parts as important guiding principles. Suicide is a very stressful experience, I‚Äôve gone through it. I‚Äôm sure you must have been very stressed and sad. It takes a lot of effort to end it all, just sitting in a room and crying incessantly about everything, feeling your life flash before you. 

Please get continuous therapy okay ??? Mental health is very important. I hope you have a trusted friend or a family member to talk with. The key is to talk and receive  the necessary help you need. You might need to consult psychiatrists or psychologists in case you feel like you still have a pending problem or a traumatising situation or just depression in general. Please seek help :D.

Congratulations on your job. So proud of you. I hope life rewards you generously. Pain is temporary and it will pass. So stay strong( I know it‚Äôs not easy but I know you are trying your best).

Also please take care of your mental health, it is very important. Try to indulge in your hobbies and perhaps volunteer or do part time jobs till you find the stable  full time job that you wish for.  We take the good times of life as memories and the bad times( or the not so good times) as lessons to learn from. Life is a journey so enjoy it to the fullest while you can.

I‚Äôm happy that you got out of a toxic relationship. Although cheating on you   when he could have just told you he wanted to break up  was quite immature and indecent on his side but we also have to be balanced and look at both sides. I‚Äôm so happy for you, you will find great people. People who will share your perks and quirks. People who will love you for all your jokes, things you love and just have deep conversations. When you find true love you‚Äôll know because there will just be a certain warmth that you feel. ‚ù§Ô∏èYou need to forgive ( I know it‚Äôs not easy) but forgiving would help you move on. Once you forgive you need to forget which also takes a lot of time.This would help you heal. Don‚Äôt hold grudges against both of them. Forgiving doesn‚Äôt mean you are losing out , it just means you are more courageous and rational and most of all mature. 

Second about your coursework. Art is a very gruelling but rewarding subject. The reason why you may be falling behind is because you may be very depressed and your mental health may be suffering. When we feel sad we often tend to procrastinate or push things for later. You mentioned about your best friend, maybe you can talk out your problems with a trusted friend, family members or even a good therapist. I‚Äôm so proud of you nonetheless because even though things are hard you are still trying. Really grateful that your best friend is helping you. Just take one step at a time. Perhaps if you spend 4 hours everyday with breaks in between and do it consecutively for 10 days you‚Äôll be able to finish your project. You‚Äôll get through this. Try to use art to express whatever you are feeling inside, then it won‚Äôt seem like much of a chore. May I ask , what type of art are you referring to? :) 

Also I really with the best for you.You are trying your best so dont push yourself down.We take the good parts of life and use it for the memories and the bad parts( or the not so good parts) as lessons.

SGExams,febx2m3,t3_eo7567,1578963715.0,"Pretty sad that you thought of poly nursing as a dumping ground :( . Nursing has a lof of career progression and it requires a lot of passion. Not everyone can do it. You have to work for long hours and sometimes you are not even remunerated enough. Plus the gruelling shifts would make you extremely fatigued. But what would keep you going is the burning passion to help people. You seem like a nice person so I assume that you were fed these misconceptions through your family members or otherwise. Nursing is so much more than it is thought to be and to degrade it is very irrational and narrow minded. At the end of the day when you are direly sick , there‚Äôll only be a nurse to nurture you and offer you comfort. 
Nurses and doctors are totally two different occupations. Mind you, nurses are not doctors‚Äô assistants they are the ones interacting with patients perhaps 10x more than the doctor. Some nurses including chief nurses are paid heftily so do keep an open mind :). 


With that said I suggest that you try a JC instead it‚Äôs not good to enter something halfheartedly. Also do note that nursing and medicine are TWO DIFFERENT COMPETENCIES, so I suggest if it‚Äôs medicine you‚Äôd like to pursue then you might choose to enter JC or poly Biomedical Science. I‚Äôve never heard of anyone go to poly nursing and then became a doctor, maybe there is but you can go research if you are adamant about it. 

Last note is keep an open mind. Every job has its ups and downs. Let‚Äôs not diminish the value of our passions and jobs. Ask yourself why you really want to pursue medicine is it cause of the passion or just the money( which is totally okay if that‚Äôs what you want) because even being a doctor requires sleepless nights, very good precision and also a strong heart to deal with all sorts of situations."

mentalhealth,f7ddp04,t3_dvl50d,1573614049.0,"That is so f**king sad, YOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS. Tell your mother that her life is precious. Sit down with her and tell her how much she means to you. Tell her she has a lot to live for like seeing you graduate, seeing you and your brother get married, she deserves to see beautiful places she has never met before, and enjoy the bliss of listening to retro music, playing with your grandkids etc. 

Please advise your angel of a mother to leave her job. She doesn‚Äôt deserve to be mistreated like that. There are so many employment options out there. I know it‚Äôs not easy but staying around people who constantly criticise your mom is going to severely affect her mental health.  Also talk with your brother and explain to him the situation if possible :), advice him to be more kinder to your mom. 

I understand that your brother has some problems as well ( poor thing ‚ù§Ô∏è) Does he go for therapy? Talk to him about his problems. Let him know you are there for him. The reason why he argues is because he has so much anger and pain inside him that he just has to get it out and sadly he gets it out on your mother. Help him get treatment or therapy. 

Since two of your family members are at high risk of suicide, I really suggest that you if you can, bring them to a psychologist. They need to get the proper help to better deal with stress.Depending on your location there might be free mental health services available. 

Also do urge your mother and brother to contact mental health hotlines. I was on the verge of suicide, and I talked to a hotline. All they did was listen and that was all I needed. Sometimes talking to a stranger about our problems can really help. 


About your aunt, if it‚Äôs difficult to talk about the situation with  her, then I suggest you try to avoid your mother from conversing with her as much as possible. Tell her you aunt if possible about the things your mother is going through. Is it possible to relocate your aunt? 

I know that you are caught in the middle of all this too. Don‚Äôt lose yourself amidst all this chaos. It will pass, life is a lesson. Please consult a psychiatrist if possible.

But then again there‚Äôs a silver lining. Sometimes people ( although very few) really do consider  personality. I really cant imagine connecting with someone who doesn‚Äôt have a good personality. 

It‚Äôs really horrible that you feel that you are unattractive. Don‚Äôt recite it to yourself all the time. You seem like a really cool person in touch with their emotions. You come off as a bold person to me and that to me is sexy. You don‚Äôt deserve all the hate. Beauty isn‚Äôt constant. You find flowers beautiful but you also find glow in the dark stickers stunning, but they dont look anything like each other. Beauty manifests itself in many forms and I know society makes us think otherwise but really inner beauty is more crucial than  external aesthetics. 

You need to slowly love yourself. When you love yourself you‚Äôll radiate confidence and that would attract people to you. Plus let me tell you dear, beauty will fade but personality would never EVER FADE. All those people who are loving you solely for beauty they are not in love with you they are in love with pretty things. 


I wish I can show you how amazing you are. Look, I already want to talk to you and be you friend and I‚Äôve never even met you. Trust me there are so many people out there who would kill to have someone like you.

It will take time but you‚Äôll surely find someone. You seem like a really mature and wise person and I bet there are many people out there who wish that they can find a person like you. 

I deal with loneliness too on a daily basis, and I  hate it. However slowly I began to find ways to cope with my loneliness. Do you like pets? Animals are great companions if you are interested. You may also try nurturing plants. When you feel the need to take care of something, it gives you a purpose. Focus more on your hobbies, things you love doing. I know everywhere you go you see people with company and friends, but take it one step at a time and try to embrace the loneliness and channel it into confidence. Talk to a therapist, loneliness can be a MAJOR PROBLEM OF YOU DON‚ÄôT seek HELP right away. Dont shy away from speaking out about your loneliness like you did ( I‚Äôm so proud of you for doing that). You can also try volunteering if you like to help people. Depending on where you live, you may also wish to foster or adopt children if you are fond of kids. Searching for a romantic partner in a dating site may be helpful. You are still very young, take your time to go on dates and explore your likes and dislikes. That being said I know loneliness is not as easy to get over as we presume it to be. In fact it takes a lot of courage. So take it slow, everything you do is an accomplishment. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also I‚Äôm really fudging sorry about the passing of your dear friends. Don‚Äôt beat yourself over it, they met you, they made great memories with you and now they are just enjoying eternal peace and moving on to another phase in life.  They are never really gone until you forget them, and they‚Äôll live on in your heart. Are there group talk sessions about losing loved ones near your area? Talk about it okay, don‚Äôt keep this pain to yourself. 


I hope you find your peace and have an amazing family in the future. Things will get better, they always do or at least we become stronger and more capable of dealing with our problems. Your problems are valid, thus dont be afraid to speak up. There are more people than you think in the world who are willing to stay up all night listening  to you and comforting you. I know this might not have helped. I really wish  you have a fantastic life ahead. You have important milestones to conquer. Don‚Äôt give up for this too shall pass. Hang in there :)"

: ((((((  but then again being single also means more time to spend with ourselves, do the things we love, the only validation we need is from ourselves. Like I go to the movies alone, eat at restaurants alone. At first I hated it but then I got used to it, and now I love it. 

Attraction is also subjective, while it is hard to believe and accept : beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 

You seem like a nice person. You never know :)! If you do find someone, that‚Äôs awesome if you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs still okay. 

Have a great life bro/sis ! Please don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself, you deserve good things! All the very best :D stay safe and healthy."

When my A level results are posted I will sit down and have a conversation with them and convey to them the information about nursing I‚Äôve gathered and either resolve it in a pleasant manner or if they are still not convinced I‚Äôm just going to take matters into my own hand and apply for nursing.
