arrow,ffvncb1,t1_ffvmhu3,1580268193.0,"Laurel couldn't be resurrected for the same reason Robert couldn't be, her death shaped who he became.  The ""final boss"" was the first person on the list he didn't kill which also helped shaped the hero he became so it was fitting for the show to end with him.  The ""new mystery"" would have been a waste of time and disappointing to waste time on for the series finale of ARROW.  And if you actually paid attention in crisis the anti monitor said that the monitor becoming the monitor and creating the anti-matter universe was inevitable."
