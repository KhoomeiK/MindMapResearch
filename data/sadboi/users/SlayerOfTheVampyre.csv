TwoXChromosomes,flwjbnq,t1_flwhdrf,1585552776.0,"I’m not OP but maybe I can help answer this. 

Reckless driving (driving tantrum) is a good reason to leave someone. If your partner is willingly putting you in danger because they got mad, and now they are swerving or speeding, then that’s a complete disregard for safety. 

Anger by itself isn’t bad, it’s just an emotion that is good to be acknowledged and understood. Someone who handles anger badly can be scary, though. I have a tough time around people who yell, for example, even if it’s yelling at something like video games. For me, an occasional frustrated “my team sucks!” is alright, but a full blown temper tantrum that ends in telling people to kill themselves- well, you don’t know who is at the other end of the screen, and what damage you’re doing by saying that. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is that it’s very subjective and nobody is perfect. Badly handled anger can be very hurtful and scary to people around them, though. I wouldn’t be with a partner who had trouble with their temper, but it might not bother others as much. What you’re describing- kicking furniture and yelling at reckless drivers- that’s not totally out of the norm, and it doesn’t hurt anyone, so it’s probably okay."
