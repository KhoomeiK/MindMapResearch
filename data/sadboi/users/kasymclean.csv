I still get anxiety and depressive periods but the severity is much less (part of that is knowing more now than before) and the periods last for a much shorter period of time. My suggestion is to take the medication but stay in regular contact with someone who knows you well and who you trust. Tell them your concerns and ask them to watch for any major changes.
