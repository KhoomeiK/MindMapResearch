NoStupidQuestions,f6xs77s,t3_dtnyud,1573257030.0,Correct. I should’ve explained better but this is what I was looking for. Sorry if I was vague I was trying to rush through. I appreciate everyone’s input:)
NoStupidQuestions,f6xrxz7,t1_f6xrun8,1573256829.0,YES!!!! omg thank you this was killing me lol

NoStupidQuestions,f6xrob8,t1_f6xrm2r,1573256624.0,No :/ I’m pretty sure it’s just one word. I’ve tried google but that shit doesn’t help lol thank you though!
WDP,f3t84kr,t3_di3ihr,1571122054.0,"I see it too!!! The comedy in shows nowadays is so different. Honestly I think people just have dry taste in what is “funny” now.  Not sure why it’s hated on so much, I never hear anyone complain about That 70s show or make fun of it. 

I love both shows btw, but the hate on Friends is so high I don’t ever hear anything about any other older comedic shows. But the people I have seen hate on it are normally younger people anyway so I think it’s simply bc it’s outdated and it’s a genuine show that doesn’t portray drugs, violence, killing your brain cells content 24/7."
AmItheButtface,f3h3m3u,t3_dgyyma,1570918642.0,"This would bother me as well! I say, sometimes you will just have to suck it up. Leaving them there would just build up more mold and smell.. is that something you really want to deal with? I say this bc I’ve experienced this living with my sister. I cannot stand a dirty kitchen, it’s so disgusting to me. I hope you guys can find some sort of middle ground. Maybe try doing them together, or you do the dishes and he wipes the counters or sweeps or something. Good luck OP"
WDP,f35vy3p,t3_dfphlu,1570693627.0,"because people will believe in anything, as long as it can justify why they’re bitter, bitchy and so on. every time I read a horoscope it always sounds so fucking cliché. like oh wow, so you have trust issues, and everyone hates this sign, and this sign lies a lot and this sign is sooooooo real, wow. people just need to feel like they’re in control and have some type of guidance in their life. have you ever heard someone say they can FEEL what kind of sign someone is? I can feel how shallow those people are. haha!"
AmItheAsshole,f32enot,t3_df44zg,1570605323.0,"NTA 

I know someone who is in this very spot... and I’ve seen it first hand. It’s really frustrating bc they do it all for their partner and their partner does not show any appreciation. They would have no regard for how dirty the house seemed but were quick to snap at him for not spending time with them (while their partner is cleaning, cooking, taking care of the kids and working FT and PT job, only off on sundays) or she would go out all the time and spend the money their partner made....  with no care for how the bills or food would be paid. oh and she would use anxiety and OCD as an excuse saying she can’t clean bc she isn’t in the mood. 

I hope you’re able to get away from this toxic relationship. It isn’t fair to you or the kids that she is not making an effort to keep a clean home while you try your damn best to do it all alone. 

You do not deserve the short end of the stick! Good luck OP"

TooAfraidToAsk,f2e9w1s,t3_dd3jfh,1570188112.0,"It’s going to take time, don’t feel alone bc you’re not! What are some things that you are good at? I would put more energy into that as it may help with your self esteem. If you don’t have any, maybe explore and get out of your comfort zone. Take lots of pictures, I think that by doing this and looking back at them, you will grow into loving what makes you, YOU. On the beard thing, you are plenty young still so it may take a while to grown in, but you can shave once any facial hair starts to grown in so that it comes back thicker and fuller and maybe once you start growing more facial hair invest in lotions and conditioners."

TooAfraidToAsk,f2e9hrk,t3_dd48n8,1570187645.0,"I think it’s probably your body sensitive to touch since you’re becoming more exhausted and relaxed, touch somehow throws it off. I personally have not felt this but it makes sense. It’s almost like the touch is alerting your body and brain to wake up. It’s almost like when you dream you’re falling and you wake up in jolt. I haven’t done any research so I’m sorry if this isn’t useful"
TooAfraidToAsk,f2e91d8,t3_dd51ku,1570187092.0,"Sometimes it’s not a matter of choosing but rather than surviving. A lot of good paying jobs demand experience without allowing one to learn at an entry level. It can be tough so to say to find a good paying job with no experience. I personally, have not gone to college bc I do not have the finances and am not going to be stuck in debt to “better my life” and pay back loans 30 years later. I also know tons of people who have gone to school and aren’t working in their field of study bc of lack of pay, experience or simply just work. Retail is shitty, but it’s pretty much what you can get your hands on and sometimes the hours are flexible. Most people are lucky if they can get out and land an entry level job and then move up from there with the experience they gain. It has its pros and cons, pros can be flexible scheduling, extra hours during holiday seasons, you can move up quickly bc people are constantly leaving. Cons - shitty customers, a lot of times shitty management, stress, sleep and energy deprived etc. Retail can suck you dry of motivation, so you wake up day in and day out in a funk to go to work and make the money you can to survive in this dead end economy. You can’t quit bc who knows when you’ll get another job or what the pay will be (unless of course you have one lined up) It gets the bills paid so you lower your standards and suck it up to survive. 

Some people are good for it, some people love the customer interactions and up selling and are good at it. However, even the sweetest and most bubbly personalities I’ve met in my years of retail have always said as soon as they get a job outside of it, they will leave and never come back. Even the sweetest people get tired of being treated like shit by both customers and companies."

WDP,f0ldur0,t3_d5arej,1568712825.0,"Personally, I think it’s because you’re joining the other persons food culture. You both start eating and trying new things, eating what the other person likes/cooks. You explore each other’s tastes and also new ways to master certain recipes or just mix it up and try something completely new to the both of you. Sometimes divorce hits people hard, and they either lose weight from not eating as much because the sadness has kicked in or they’re not eating as much because the other person isn’t there to continue those food adventures and explorations. 

It can be a healthy weight gain or loss, physically and mentally."

Twitter,expho2j,t3_ctc66j,1566490441.0,"People have been having issues with twitter lately. 

Maybe this won’t help but maybe it will — try to do a hard reset on your iPhone.

If it’s the 6 or older it should be the volume up and lock screen button and hold until you see the apple icon

Or if it’s newer, it’s volume up, volume down, lock screen button hold until then icon comes up. 

Hope this helps & make sure all your apps are closed."
depression,exe84vk,t3_cs2ogj,1566203165.0,"Hi, first of all I want to remind you that you’re only human and it’s okay to feel things such as sadness and depression. But, you can beat it — you’re not alone. You have all of us as well who have been there or are going through it currently. Remember to take everything one day at a time. Breathe. Life is precious, I promise it is. It took me a long time to get to where I am, but I am so grateful that every attempt I’ve ever made did not go through. There is always a light after the tunnel. Depression is not a choice but living is. Choose your family, choose us, choose tomorrow, choose the thought of being happy you chose to stay someday. Choose being someone else’s light in this dim dark world. Choose yourself. 

Choose living, one day at a time. With love and support from your family, from us, from me."

Constantly starting drama and belittling me in front of my employees. I do my shit, mind my business day in and day out, and yet they treat me like I’m incapable of performing my job.  I can’t even go to the SM because he’s just as petty and fake. It’s like they’re all just buddies and fuck around while I pick up their slack and run shit."
