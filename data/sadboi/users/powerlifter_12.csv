mentalillness,fpazo12,t3_gcbbjq,1588459054.0,"I‚Äôve rationalized it after my uncles suicide a few years ago. I was already diagnosed with depression and attempted once at the time. The way I had to explain it to all my family is that the brain is an organ that can become diseased and in some cases it wants to die and suicide is one of the ways it wants to die so it tells you that you‚Äôre not worthy of life anymore. This is something I‚Äôve thought long and hard about, I‚Äôve accepted death but my desire to live is much greater now than it has been."
MiniatureSchnauzer,fo9i91w,t3_g6efgj,1587620282.0,"For the barking and stuff, a bark collar or a shock collar might work. They have different makes and models for em so I would do research on em. We used a shock collar for a different breed of dog and it worked well for him. My aunts vet suggested a shock collar for the barking for her mini (if she gets another mini) and start her out early to not go crazy barking. My first schnauzer absolutely loved everyone and never met a stranger. The one I have now, is getting more attached to me and my mom (I live by myself and I take her everywhere with me) and is very shy when she meets new people. 
Hope this helps, I know it‚Äôs long"
