I would talk and talk and talk about extremely private and creepy stuff to strangers or coworkers or managers or family members. I remember I went to an HR manager, who I knew well, at a coffee break and told her like ""yeah I'm bipolar and you know we have a lot of problems with alcohol and drugs and can have dangerous sexual lives and I'm often depressed and suicidal ;) Btw these scars are self-harm lol"". 
I'd have thoughts like ""ok so next plan is quit my job, apply to PhD programs, and if it doesn't work, I'm gonna end my fucking pathetic little life lmao"".
My psychiatrist told me ""You're telling me horrifying and dreadful things but you smiling and laughing and you seem too happy about that"". She also told me it was the most dangerous situation because I definitely want to die like when you do a depressive episode, but you also have the energy and ""optimism"" of mania."

For depression, it's kind of complicated. I can't count the number of severe depressions I've done since these past 4 years. I've been more depressed in 2018 than normal. My only advice is, try to be at least functional: shower, get dressed, try to walk around, see people. See it as small victories. Small victories are better than nothing. Now if it doesn't work, be really careful and listen to your suicidal thoughts. If they are getting out of hand (you know what to use, when you'll do that, the letter is ready or you're thinking about it, you're planning things), then tell your therapist immediately and go to the hospital.

I used to be very patient and calm, and was scared of being seen as aggressive but now I don't care I just say ""It's private sorry"" or ""I don't want to talk about it"".

I must precise that I indeed don't want to talk about it because a large majority people tend to say inappropriate, rude, or disrespectful things. If they're the kind of people that ask me what's my problem the first time I meet them, I'm pretty sure they're gonna be the rude type of people."

https://bust.com/feminism/195520-toxic-femininity.html

> A pick-me is a woman whom desires the validation of men to the point of promoting and agreeing with sexist standards, all to be praised by sexist men and hopefully be chosen by a “worthy” sexist men. Pick me women rely on respectability politics, slut shaming, and constant comparisons of themselves to “lesser” women. These women are toxic because they also dabble in promotion of rape culture, victim blaming, and promote the idea that submission patriarchy is better for women than having control of their own life. They promote the ideas that women are meant to be nothing more than breeders, maids, and cooks to men and that a woman’s own personal goals and ambitions are secondary to those of men.

iamatotalpieceofshit,ep477je,t1_ep09yv1,1559034864.0,"> No, you have to define your words properly. What is ""Masculine"" about social norms, exceptions and stereotypes? You can't just gender a word and then say ""Oh well, its all just this evil shit in the society dude""

Do you read the answers you get ? What have you been reading in my comment, I have no idea where that came from. 

There is nothing masculine about social norms, expectations and stereotypes. I've never said that and i really don't understand this sentence. 
Toxic masculinity : ""Men must be this way, and this way only, or we're gonna fuck them hard"" - Society. Men must be strong, violent, they must love sex and sports and mechanics etc. 

Does that mean that men can't love sex, sports and mechanics ? NO. IT IS FINE TO LIKE THIS. Is it wrong to **force** men to love this, by educating them to be this way and this way only ? YES, LET MEN DO WHAT THEY WANT. 

What don't you understand in ""Bashing toxic masculinity is about saying fuck to people telling you what you're supposed to do because you're a man even if it hurts you"". It's about helping **you** do what you want and not be called a pussy or faggot. Why do you think men have a higher rate of suicide ? Because men aren't supposed to cry or talk about their feelings, because only women do that because they're sentimentals and emotionnal (**oh, a stereotype that concerns women and that is not toxic masculinity, but on the contrary, does the same for women**).

Why is it called toxic masculinity ? Because we're talking about stereotypes about **men**. Want to talk about toxic feminity, sure, do your thing, **but** toxic feminity isn't about bashing women, it's about bashing people that say women must be this way. 

Conclusion : 

* Toxic masculinity = Society **attacking men** if they don't fit the social standards (strong, violent, dominant, not emotional and cold, like manly stuff like sports and cars (exemples), etc.)

* Toxic feminity = Society **attacking women** if they don't fit the social standards (soft, loving, sentimental, romantic, like feminine stuff like pink, shoppingn cooking, etc.)

Who created these standards ? Society, since thousands of years. Who, today, reinforces these standards for **both** men and **women** ? Almost everyone. Men and women attack men for not respecting masculine standards ; men and women attack women for not respecting feminine standards."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ep44zlr,t1_ep0e6bk,1559033829.0,"Funny how you assume my position on a topic before letting me answer. 

Let's see. Why toxic feminity is not about blaming women for their own victimization 101. First let's explain (once again) what TM is.

Toxic masculinity : society says that men are supposed to be this way, and only this way. If they're not, fuck them and treat them like they are less of a man (i.e let's call them pussy, women, faggots, little girls, babies, little dick, etc.). You know these posts on r/gatekeeping which say ""if your boyfriend doesn't have a beard, you have a boyfriend"". Guess what ? Toxic masculinity. You know these posts on r/tinder where girls say that small guys are mosquitoes and ridiculous ? Also toxic masculinity.

Consequences : Let's mock these men, abuse them, insult them, not believe them when they're raped or abused, condition them to fit our definition of masculinity and have them be affraid of talking about their feelings. 

Does fighting against TM criticize men ? No. Does it want to change men and make them fit another discourse ? No. What does it want then ? It want men to be liberated and be what they **want** to be. However, if they want to be assholes, let's blame them personnally. 

So. Is there something similar if we look at women's condition ? Is there a phenomenon which force women to fit social norms ? Are there rules that state ""women should be like this and not like that"" ? Let's think about it reaaaaaaally hard.... Oh yeah, it took me two secs and i have my answer :) OBVIOUSLY YES. 

Are women in the middle eastern victims of this ? Are they forced to fit a social narrative on what it means to be a woman ? Obviously, yes.

Social norms pressure people to follow some rules and punish them if they don't. Who do you think is at fault ?

Conclusion : Toxic masculinity is **not** an attack on men. It's an attack on expectations and pressure set on men. Why is this article an exemple of toxic masculinity ? Boys are supposed to like sex, so it's not rape (according to your detractors). Obviously it's false : it's a rape. The boy is **victim** of toxic masculinity, not because he is a boy, but because everyone think that because he is a boy,  it wasn't a rape.


EDIT: i found great exemple to prove that everyone, both men and women, find this topic (statutory rape) funny. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM28YFrMdfI
Look at the actors and the comments. You'll agree it's actually a rape (same as what the article describes). But it's seen as funny, hahaha what a joke, of course he liked it, he's a boy and boys sure do like sex!! It's awful but people don't take it seriously. I'm sure you'll agree with me, we both agree on this. No one is safe, neither from men nor from women. Why is it awful ? First it's a rape. Second, people find it funny and say ""good job kiddo"" while the boy feel disguting and also lonely, because he's the only one that knows it was a rape."

Saying a 15 year old boy can't be raped because he would like it because he's a boy and all boys like sex ? It's toxic masculinity. Yes women can support and be responsible for these stereotypes. But men also. Just look at the men saying ""yeaah way to go"", ""nice, dude"", etc.

No, 80% of the shaming don't come from women, they mostly come from men who don't want to be seen as pussies or fags by their friends and that feel like violence is the only answer to conflict because they want to prove they have a huge dick.

I didn't say that i hated them or that they were assholes. I said that i was grateful they try. But sometimes you can hurt someone even if you are supportive. In my case, i did a pretty severe depression when i was 14 and tried to kill myself. My parents tried to reassure me and said it wasn't that bad, that i was just sad. They meant well but they fucked me up and i didn't get help until last year, 10 years later.

I told my therapist about all the things my father said to be supportive ( stuff like ""i'm more fucked up than you"", ""it's just a burn out"", ""it happens to everybody"" ) and she told me he meant well, but that he was toxic. I don't hate them, i love them and i don't want to be an asshole, but when something really hurts you, you have to make it stop even if it means you have to be a little selfish.

And obviously they could be more antagonistic. But just because there are worst people out there doesn't mean we should overlook our own problems.

People don't know how to react when you tell them you're ill. Which I understand of course. We talk a lot about people that are mean or treat you like you're crazy and stuff. It sucks obviously but we talk so much about them that we forget about the other side of the coin. 

When people are too benevolent or sympathetic, they can also cause damages. I am surrounded by friends and by my family and they all support me which is great and i'm very greatful for that. But sometimes (or always) they have absolutely no idea what to say but feel like they must say something no matter what. They usually try to reassure you but doing this they just get the opposite reaction. I call it minimization.

Basically, they tell you not to worry, what you're experiencing isn't that bad don't be afraid, they also feel like this sometimes IT'S GONNA BE FINE

Stop. Doing. This. It's the worst. Imagine you feel like shit or that something's reaaally wrong and you're afraid, and then someone tells you ""meh it's okay everybody have ups and downs ;)"".

Am I faking it?"". So yeah, not useful at all, I'd rather be told to worry so I can get some help instead of keeping it to myself. Also it's painful and really annoying so now I just don't talk to anybody at all, except my sister.

Just listen to my rants or worries or news from my doctors, but don't say anything.
