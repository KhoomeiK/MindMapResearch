Most of my takeaway from that class had nothing to do with that part lol, but a piece that did stick out is how songs like spring are used a lot in popular media, I assume because they're old enough to be fair use. Often in that class the professor would play a song and we would instantly recognise it as something that player in a commerical or the likes. Idk other than that the song itself is fine lol it's not even my favorite in the seasons but it's the most recognisable and therefore made the most sense to go with my story."

Of course you don't have to do anything and an internet stranger telling you too isn't going to change your decision, but if you do live in the future you might regret it as much as I do. The constant loop of want to die, but too scared to die, but too scared to live, is fucking draining and it's even worse when you can't find a way out."
