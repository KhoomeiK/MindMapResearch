Anxiety,fpt1q83,t3_gf7ars,1588883345.0,"Want to stop anxiety? Stop trying to stop it

Anxiety is perpetuated when you the sufferer is trying to gain control of it. It's a pointless exercise - it would be like trying to gain control of digesting your food. Anxiety works on the subconscious level and is perceiving your perception of danger. The bluff of anxiety messing with your head is basically your brain saying ""well shit she is still wrestling around, trying to ""fight"" this danger, better continue producing anxious symptoms."" And then the cycle perpetuates - you fear your own fear producing mechanism, it releases adrenaline, you feel the symptoms, you fear them, etc.

I recommend this to everyone - stop fighting anxiety. You cannot win, there is a 0% success rate to fighting anxiety. Want to know why panic attacks happen? Because people keep fighting control over them. But that in turn makes them worse! Accept anxiety, keep an open door relationship with it, and you'll realize it's a big paper tiger that can't hurt you, just duping you.

If your mind now sees eating as a fear, chances are now the pattern will repeat. Anytime you approach food, anxiety will activate because it stores that moment in your head as something to be scared of because you perceive it so. The way around it is continually doing that until anxiety concludes that it doesn't need to be around anymore, and the ""danger"" will dissolve. This really is like the most caveman part of our brain at work. Anxiety doesn't listen to rhyme or reason, it acts as silly as someone fearing balloons or window curtains - it treats all perceived dangers the same."

I think the first step of walking through fear is to change your attitude - which MAY sound counterintuitive at first, but it can make an impact. If you change your reaction to anxiety on the outside, that is smiling in the mirror, laughing, it can diminish its grip. I tend to be roll my eyes and beg it to do its worst because I know it can't hurt me, despite how bad it WANTS to convince me otherwise (and it's supposed to - anxiety is supposed to make a threat YOU perceive as REAL as possible so your life is saved, even in a threat where you consciously know isn't life threatening)."
Anxiety,fpfhc8s,t3_gcsugq,1588571263.0,"I see your post and read - ""fighting.""

Do you realize fighting anxiety is what keeps it alive? Your body will do something that may not gel with you and odds are you freak out, worry, and in turn tell your brain, which is already in a sensitized state, to now worry about this fear, and activate anxiety. Anxiety activates and creates the symptoms you're feeling because you perpetuate it as a threat. But it isn't - it is your subconscious mind reacting emotionally. You cannot win in this fight. It is NOT meant to be a battle, are you batting with your stomach to digest food the way YOU want? Fighting your bladder into filling with urine at YOUR desired pace? Anxiety is the same, you cannot consciously control it.

Anxiety is a puzzle not worth solving. Just quit fighting and let it do its worst. It can't hurt you, whatsoever. It's a paper tiger that tries to be big and scary, but pull back the curtain and it's one big bluff, just like Oz."
Anxiety,fpfh3ov,t3_gczbik,1588571059.0,"I assume that you're a currently anxious person - this means something set your body in a sensitized state - whether it be a constant buildup of stress, panic attack, whatever happened it put your nerves in a red hot state, meaning they are more susceptible to triggering at the slightest stimulation.

You want to know why they never go away? Because you are trying effortlessly to wrestle with a mechanism that is controlled by your subconscious. All this effort to gain control, to wish it away is futile. You cannot gain control over your anxiety. That is why I personally think practicing acceptance is the best, natural method to overcoming anxiety. With acceptance you break the cycle and just allow your mins to run rampant. You don't assign your subconscious defense mechanism as a threat! It's a paradox! Everything you are feeling, despite how weird and uncomfortable, is all an effort to save your life! We aren't supposed to be cognizant of when our anxiety is running. It would be like trying to consciously control digesting food."
