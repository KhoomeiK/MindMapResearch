Anxiety,fqc46ap,t3_gi0huc,1589249751.0,"You're not alone. There's actually comfort in our mental disorders (weird to say I know) but basically that means that it's become so a part of who we are that we're subconsciously terrified of getting better. It can lead to self destructive behavior. 

When I start to feel good and begin to move in the right direction, I then have horrible anxiety that something is gonna go wrong or I'm going to fuck it up somehow. And what do you know, it happens. I'm dead certain it's my mindset. 

Healing from mental illness is a journey. It's hard and its exhausting. But you deserve peace from your own mind. 

Remember, you have anxiety but anxiety doesn't have you."

Fuck your parents. Fuck every parent like this. How dare someone have children and then treat them this way. I could NEVER imagine being this way to my sons. Ever. They're my babies but they're not my possessions. They think freely and will grow into their own person. 

You can't fucking try to force your child to be how you think they should be, be disrespectful and hateful to them, and then cry and moan when it not only doesn't work, but it blows up in your face and bada bing bada boom, your child can't stand you. 

Congratufuckinglations to your parents, they're staring at the hole they dug for themselves. 

Don't feel bad love. Your parents are toxic.

If she is able to work and can shoot you dirty looks then it's obvious she's not so disabled where she's unaware of her environment and her behavior. She's doing it on purpose and is using her disability as an excuse to behave how she wishes. I've seen a lot of disabled people who are perfectly functional but it's been hammered into them that they're mentally handicapped (usually by fucked up parents) so even though they're self aware, they become spoiled in a sense that they know they can use their disability to get out of pretty much anything.
