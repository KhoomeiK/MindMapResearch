No need to go out of your way to avoid her, but limit your interactions with her. If she needs help, it seems she is the kind to reach out to you. Maybe let her initiate next time and give her time. 

If she really does not want your help... that is her choice. Respecting that is the most important.

However I chose my mental health first and decided chasing money isnt going to make me happy. I realized it when I sat by the administrative assistants as there was no more space in my team for me to sit. They left work earlier than me and were way happier. I was often the only one left late into the night. 

Sure those people make a lot of money, but I also see they barely sleep and see their families. I bet they don't have a chance to enjoy their own hard earned money. You got one life. Embrace it!"
