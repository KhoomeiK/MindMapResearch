The mundane is sacred for without it nothing could be sacred. for the same reason, sleeping people are needed at this time to allow for wakefulness to happen. time is transient and already happened everywhere all at once forever... right now, there are some people asleep. there are also some that aren't. so what? it is meaningless. mind your own business - takes a spade to know a spade. we only see ourselves in these 'sleepers'/'dreamers', a past reflection of perception. there is no spiritual 'type' only egos that wear the costume of 'spiritual vocabulary and paradigms', much like egos that wear the mask of 'not spiritual' relevant to their experience and symbolic understanding of the universe or cosmos. 

&#x200B;

what's warped is our sense of what's real and what's not and what matters ultimately. you'd have to be asleep to some degree to not see the absurdity of even trying to make sense of it all. to be completely awake would be to be asleep, for you'd realize that the world is perfect in all of its imperfections and for you to think you know better or could improve upon it is pure hubris of the ego in an attempt to overthrow 'god'. 

i prefer to feel as though i'm lucid dreaming - awake, but asleep. red and blue pilled. lol
