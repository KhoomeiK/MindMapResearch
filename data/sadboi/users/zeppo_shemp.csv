- you will stay in the area for 5 years or more. property tends to increase in value over the long-term, but buying and selling within a few years can be a loss after all the moving costs and mortgage paperwork, inspections, etc.

- you have an emergency fund of at least 3 months of savings

- you have a down payment in addition to the emergency fund, 20% or more is ideal to avoid Private Mortgage Insurance but not always possible with a first time purchase.

- the mortgage will be a max of about 3x gross household income with a payment of no more than about 25% after-tax income per month. from this angle you could potentially afford a $100k house.

investing,fqjk15v,t3_gj5zh4,1589411040.0,"there's a lot of research showing that lump sum investing tends to outperform DCA (citations below). when DCA is defined as you're already sitting on $X ... should you invest $12k all at once or invest $1000 per month over the next year? that's true DCA, as opposed to regular investing from a paycheck into a 401k. 

there can be a practical advantage to DCA when dealing with someone who makes investing decisions with their stomach. if they would freak out after investing all $12k at once, and the market slipped 10% in a week. for those types of people DCA can calm their nerves and keep them investing. but hypothetically they'd tend to under perform someone who invested all $12k all at once, and let it ride. 

front-load fees are similar. on paper, a 5% front load fee plus an annual management fee is just a rip off compared to a similar fund without the front load. by this line of reasoning, American Funds should have been out of business decades ago when there are lower fee options on similar funds from other companies. but Ken Fisher (IIRC) said somewhere that in real-world scenarios the front load investor often comes out ahead in the long term. the front load fee makes people feel more committed or locked-in to the mutual fund. they stick with the plan. this is in comparison with many investors who are constantly chasing trends, buying or selling at the wrong time, etc., and undermining their long-term growth even though the fees might be lower compared to a front load fund.

most of the DR haters clearly don't listen to the show. it gets tiring to reply to all the misinformation in threads like these.

EDIT -- hey OP, think about this: some of the people on this sub are so angry at Dave Ramsey that they'll *downvote research from Harvard and Northwestern Universities if it validates what Ramsey has been saying for years.* That's nuts, completely insane, like people on a health sub downvoting research from the May Clinic. also ask at /r/DaveRamsey or /r/personalfinance for opinions, don't assume the people on this sub have a monopoly on wisdom. people who are willing to change their habits and mindset seem to be a minority. believe it or not, Ramsey was the first person I heard who told me it was okay to say ""no"" to money requests from my crazy, addict family. content like that was absolutely critical to me. I was debt free when I came across his show in about 2007, but he helped me fine tune my budgeting and investing. it took me 18 months to pay off my credit card debts, but if I'd had a clear simple plan could have done it in closer to 8 or 12 months. I started paying attention to the 401k and investing in about 2005 or 06, and Ramsey helped keep me calm through the market crash. he was saying the same things he's saying now: don't panic, stick with the plan, the US market has always recovered after a crisis...

And also think about this: did anyone on this thread say, ""I don't like Dave Ramsey but go check out John Doe or Karen Smith, they have a better plan?"" Nope. Did anyone say, ""I personally developed a plan that went like this..."" Not that I saw. mostly it was relentless negativity, hostility and criticisms. 

The truth is that Ramsey's plan works. If it didn't work, big companies like Costco and Aldi wouldn't be sending their employees through Ramsey's Smart Dollar program (a secularized version of the plan, with no religious content). these companies have done it for years, so listen to Costco more than you listen to Poverty Finance. 

And it's all free: you can use the budget app free with a dummy email address for privacy concerns. you can follow the baby steps free. you can get the books at the library when it reopens, read 'em and follow the plan. community suport can be a big part of success on the plan, but if you can't or don't want to take the financial peace classes in person there are online forums where people are encouranging rather than negative. if you don't like where you are and you've been doing behavior X you need to stop doing X and try Y or Z. just try it for 90 days, if you don't like it try something else."

(1) stopping retirement contributions, because if you keep contributing to retirement while you have debt it's as if you're using debt to finance the retirement. think of a balance sheet: Debt on one side, assets on the others. 

(2) cutting expenses (eating out, vacations...)

(3) selling the car and downgrading

investing,forhd7c,t3_g8o98t,1588012253.0,"read books. a good book can go into far more detail than the best online resources. a few I've particularly enjoyed, with some rambling commentary because I'm stuck at home: 

- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. somewhat dated but historically important and still has good advice. Graham pioneered value investing, a strategy of buying stocks that are on sale or priced low relative to an analysis of the company's 'fundamentals': income, earnings, profits, and 'book value' (the total of all assets minus all debts if everything was sold). historically and over long periods, value investing has tended to out perform every other strategy. 

- The Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville, a 1984 article about value investing by Warren Buffett. he was one of Graham's students and is probably the most famous and successful investor of modern times. https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/columbia-business/superinvestors  Buffett's letters to investors in his company Berkshire-Hathaway are also worth reading. https://berkshirehathaway.com/reports.html

- All of Peter Lynch's books: One Up on Wall Street, Beating the Street; Learn to Earn is aimed at teenagers and has simplified versions of the same data. Lynch was one of the most successful investors in history while managing the Magellan Fund at Fidelity. Lynch's books are also somewhat dated, such as due to the internet it's a lot easier to find info vs. in the 1990s when Lynch wrote and you had to read the Value Line newsletter for in-depth stock/company info. But a lot of what Lynch says is still relevant today. **Especially**: don't chase trends or the hot new startups particularly in IT/computers or biotech (re-reading these books recently it was as if he was describing all the hot new cannabis companies). Instead the best investments are usually boring, established, well-managed, low-debt companies with moderate growth (too-fast growth is a red flag) and an advantage or niche to ward off competition. most of his best picks were not exciting or glamorous companies: Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts, Wal Mart, La Quinta hotels, various well-managed Savings & Loan associations or railroad lines, and Crown Cork and Seal which makes bottle caps and beverage containers ... all boring established companies with a niche. e.g., Taco Bell was the first Mexican fast food chain when American was dominated by burger joints, railroads have a sort of built-in regional monoploy and even today can be insanely profitable, La Quinta was the first mid-price hotel chain when there was a gap between luxury Hiltons & ultra-cheap Motel 6. Lynch says you want to invest in a company that an idiot could manage, because eventually an idiot with an MBA will be managing it. Lynch says there's a place for amateur stock picking, citing an amateur group that beat the markets 60-70% of the time IIRC, but he advises a very small portfolio of at least 5 and no more than 10-12 stocks. With 5 well-selected stocks he says you'll usually get 1 underperformer and 1 out-performer with the rest performing well but not spectularly. But the hobbist simply doesn't have the time for a detailed analysis/comparison of more than ~10 stocks. 

- Big Money Thinks Small by Joel Tillinghast. He worked with Lynch at Fidelity and manages the Low Price Stock Fund which specializes in small and mid size company value stocks. (interesting tidbit: Tillinghast writes how back in the day the economist John Maynard Keynes failed misterably as an investor when he tried to predict large market trands, but started beating the UK market when he turned to what people today would described as small and mid cap value investing). Tillinghast's fund had a rough few years recently (he tends to underperform in the final years of bear markets) but the fund has a history of out-performing the market. 

- Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman, a hedge fund manager and value investor who has a history of out-performance. this is out of print and absurdly expensive, but PDF scans are easy to find online. https://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/Margin.of.Safety.by.Seth.Klarman.1991.FullScan.pdf

- Lessons from the Greatest Stock Traders of All Time by John Boik. profiles of a dozen prominent successful stock traders from throughout the 20th Century.

- Ken Fisher has written some good stuff, his The Little Book of Market Myths is free online  https://www.kenfisher.com/books/little-book-market-myths

- Reminiscenses of a Stock Operator, by Edwin Lefevre. partly of historical interest about the early days of Wall Street before the 1929 crash, but it's very readable and has some practical insights into the mindset or psychology of investors, such as the risk of making decisions based on hot tips. http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60979

- John Bogle's  Little Book of Common Sense Investing Advice and Bogle on Investing. He didn't invent index funds, buthe did popularize them for the everyday investor via Vanguard and was a very influential guy who based histheories on the Efficent Market Hypothesis (EMH, the idea that assets are priced accurately by the collective decisions of all investors in the market, so there's no use trying to beat the market over the long term). See also the Boggleheads Guide to Investing by some of Bogle's most prominent followers.

- Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel a Princeton professor. presents the Random Walk Hypothesis that says stock prices move in an unpredicatble or random manner so you should just buy low-cost index funds rather than anything that's trying to beat the market averages. 

- When Genius Failed by Roger Lowenstein. About the collapse of a hedge fund with Nobel Prize winners and other assorted smart guys on staff. a good study of hubris, failing to consider risks, and the dangers of leverage. 

- What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars by Jim Paul. About an investor who well, lost a bit more than a million bucks via futures trading. Another cautionary tale.

- All of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's books (Fooled By Randomness, The Black Swan, AntiFragile, Skin in the Game). these books touch on investing but are not investing books per se, he writes about risk and probability from several different angles. He was a Wall Street options trader and one of the few people who saw the 2008 housing crash and managed to profit from it. 

- the Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson. he's a historian and this also isn't an investing book per se, but explains the origins and development of modern banking, bonds, stocks and insurance. 

- The Millionaire Next Door, the Millionaire Mind and Stop Acting Rich by Thomas J. Stanley. not investing books per se, but very important to understand if you want to be wealthy. Stanley was a finance professor who in the 1970s and '80s did some of the first systematic research into high wealth Americans. to his surprise, he found there are more millionaires per-capita in blue-collar and middle class neighborhoods than in upscale or white-collar neighborhoods. the TL;DR is that doctors and CEOs might earn more money than teachers, plumbers or farmers but the high-income earners are more likely so spend too much on lifestyle and status items like expensive foreign cars, Rolex watches, etc, and lower-income middle class people are statistically more likely to have a net worth of $1 million or more. based on their percentages of the general population, MDs are under-represented as millionaires while teachers and farmers are over-represented. Millionaire Next Door (1991) outlines the premise and Stop Acting Rich basically updates it with more recent data from 2009. Millionaire Mind is about those worth $10 million or more. 

note that these books can contradict each other. The Bogle books and Random Walk recommend buying the whole market in low-fee index funds, and they subscribe to the EMH. but Lynch, Graham, Klarman and Tillinghast say buy individual companies with certain traits. Peter Lynch is skeptical of academic theorizing generally and attributes most of his success to un-learning what was taught in his MBA program; he says Random Walk is garbage & EMH is highly dubious. Klarman notes that value investing is based on a rejection of the EMH. Tillinghast thinks the EMH has merit in a soft or weak form, but also proposes that the regular existence of bubbles and the fact that value invesging tends to beat the market over time show that the EMH is not foolproof. Buffet perhaps contradicts himself: in 1984 he outlined in detail how good value invesging can beat the market by applying the same analysis to different assets, but he's also recommended the typical investor should lean on low fee indexes. The point is a good education, formal or amateur, should involve reading a lot of information some of which clashes and analyzing or synthesizing it to reach your own conclusions. 

I feel compelled to stress that I don't buy or trade single stocks, despite reading a lot on the topic. I think it's too high risk, I'm 100% in boring established mutual funds. mostly indexes with substantial minority holdings in some established lower-fee growth, value and sector funds. if someone insists on single stocks, there's an old rule of thumb to keep it at a max of 10-15% of the overall portfolio.

povertyfinance,fnlan2i,t3_g2eymr,1587050148.0,"*bad* credit score or credit history is worse than *no* credit score or history. for example, with no credit score you can potentially get approved for a mortgage with a process called ""manual underwriting"" (it's the old-school way of verifying income, rent/utility payments, etc). in contrast, a bad credit score will usually prevent anyone from getting approved for a mortgage. it's also easier to rent an apartment with *no* credit score, if you can show steady employment and money in the bank ... but a *bad* credit score will make it harder to get into an apartment because a bad credit score usually means a history of late payments and if you'd be late on a car loan or credit card you'd also be late on the rent. 

I think your parents should stay away from 'building credit' of any kind, and limp through this mess until they can save up enough cash to buy a used car outright, no loan. research from the Federal Reserve shows there's low connection between credit score and income; people who 'build credit' often have their priorities backwards. they often need to earn more income rather than 'building credit'. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/are-income-and-credit-scores-highly-correlated-20180813.htm

edit -- and for god's sake if they insist on financing, don't get financing at used car dealership. go talk to a few local credit unions (NOT big mega banks like BoA or Wells Fargo). but if the CU recommends a credit card, just forget it and save cash. car loans are for broke people. your parents need to change their habits, not get back into the debt machine that already chewed them up and spit them out."
AskReddit,fnl9tl7,t1_fnkrg1n,1587049714.0,">Our system is based upon the assumption, popularly regarded as implicit in the doctrine of equality, that everybody is educable. This has been taken without question from the beginning; it is taken without question now. The whole structure of our system, the entire arrangement of its mechanics, testifies to this. Even our truant laws testify to it, for they are constructed with exclusive reference to school-age, not to school-ability.
