Edit: Lyrics for those who might want them.  


God forbid I forget you  
I'll hold to it if it comes through  
The darkness swallowing me whole  
Could never strip me of your soul

These chains so complicated  
These memories so faded  
They say I can't feel nothing  
But in the ocean, I heard a heartbeat

I don't know you  
I don't know me  
But somehow I know you mean everything  
You can set me free

You don't know you  
You don't know me  
But I feel a warmth inside me  
I just wanna stay like this until the sun sets on nobody

""Your mind's made up?  
Why did the keyblade choose me?  
I have to know  
You can't turn on the Organisation  
You get on their bad side and they'll destroy you  
No one would miss me  
That's not true, I would""

I'll run until I find you  
Aimless direction bound through  
The deepest crevice of my heart  
Or whatever lies beyond this dark

And yet there's something you don't say  
It seems you're somewhere else these days  
You say that this is all wrong  
But I'm scared of what's beyond

I don't know you  
I don't know me  
But somehow I know you mean everything  
You can set me free

You don't know you  
You don't know me  
But I feel a warmth inside me  
I just wanna stay like this until the sun sets on nobody

""Who are you?  
Again?  
It's weird, I feel like I'm forgetting something really important  
Kairi, remember what you said before  
I'm always with you too, I'll come back to you, I promise  
I know you will""

I don't know you  
I don't know me  
But somehow I know you mean everything  
You can set me free

You don't know you  
You don't know me  
But I feel a warmth inside me  
I just wanna stay like this until the sun sets on nobody

That's not true  
I would"

There are so many fields of magick it’s hard to give a direct answer, and to be honest I sort of “fell” into magick almost 15 years ago so I don’t remember clearly what I did. The closest thing I associated with was Wicca. For me, it was also about learning the sabbats (the wheel of the year), elemental correspondences, how to build an altar, and other symbolism. That is a personal love of mine.

That’s one thing I’d say about magick. It is very personal. You can choose to share or keep close as much as you’d like. You can practice in a solitary way, or seek out a coven. It’s up to you.

Maybe you could try YouTubing others who practice magick and see if you resonate with what they say? And from there you can build your practice. I follow a small number of witches on YouTube: Ember HoneyRaven, The Witch of Wonderlust, Harmony Nice, and Owlvine Green are some channels I’m subscribed to. There are so many more.

Best of luck!"
