SuicideWatch,f73bvb2,t1_f72qs85,1573390072.0,"Just to clarify, I was in no way encouraging or condoning anyone should PM or offer PM help to you or any others here.

I was only trying to say people in general would do well to listen rather then speak if they want to help. 

Listening to what you say you're feeling and why you're feeling it is much more beneficial and productive from my experience, from both sides of the topic.

Listen, learn, understand.
This is my personal philosophy when it comes to trying to give back in some way to others who also suffer from any kind of depression or similar issues as myself.

I would like to apologize for any part my inarticulate post may have played in creating negative feedback for you. I am sorry."
SuicideWatch,f72re51,t1_f72pzp3,1573375470.0,"One friend, three words.

""I am here.""

We ended up just sitting there for a few hours with nothing else being said, nothing more being done.

It was the most powerful and meaningful help I ever received.
I still struggle daily but that friends words have stuck with me ever since and I will always be grateful for both them and what they did."
SuicideWatch,f72f02t,t1_f727kcp,1573360830.0,"I apologize if I made you feel attacked. That was not my intent at all. Nor did I mean to imply or assume you don't struggle or have your own issues to deal with. Most of us have learned how to keep that mask on. Even if we have to nail that damn thing in place via terrible methods. As a fellow person who deals with it via SH I believe I just might be able to relate in some way. I even feel I can relate to having a short temper when feeling slighted or misunderstood in some way.

These may just be words to you, I don't know. I say it with all sincerity and honesty. I do care, even if I don't know you. As you said we are kin of some kind. You will never be wasting your breathe when talking to me. I will always listen and do my absolute very best to try and understand what you are going though.

I meant only to express my frustration with the ""fixer"" type mentality people often show. I obviously did so poorly.

So I will say again. I apologize that I made you feel attacked in any way or if you felt I thought you did not have your own problems, issues or struggles."
SuicideWatch,f723jjj,t1_f71wzf2,1573352979.0,"Very much this.
Trying to understand and relate often does so much more then just trying to help. Hell, a lot of the times this IS a very needed form of help."
SuicideWatch,f722xcm,t1_f71sy5z,1573352680.0,"""I won't die until I save at least one of you bastards.""

This is a perfect example of the point of my post above.

This is exactly why ""You and me are not becoming WE"" in so many cases.

Open mouth, closed ears.

Your ""good enough"" reason might not be mine, his, hers or theirs.

Take your own advice.

""You could and can be a shoulder for others in a time of need.""

Apply this.

""But God Damn I'm going to try.""

To this.

Listen, learn, understand.

Then you won't have to just imagine what people are feeling. 

Then you can begin to help."
SuicideWatch,f71mu5u,t1_f71l9hn,1573343940.0,"Indeed.
It has been my experience most people don't want or attempt to try and understand the problem or problems. They only want or try to fix them. Something they absolutely cannot even attempt to do without first accomplishing the first and most important thing with any problem. Actually understanding what it is."
SuicideWatch,f4jzhim,t3_dklin6,1571630175.0,"This shit breaks my heart, something I thought wasn't even possible anymore. While they might ultimately mean very little I wish I had the words to help relieve you of the feelings you have of being ugly, unwanted and isolated. Nobody should ever have to feel that way.

For whatever it might be worth from some random person on the net.

I am proud of you.

Proud of the strength it takes to share all of what you have.
Proud of your embracing a part of you that you have repressed for so long.

I hope your post has helped you process some of what you're feeling, even if only a little."
