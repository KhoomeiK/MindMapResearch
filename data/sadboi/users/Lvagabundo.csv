I kind of put her on a pedestal and rebuffed other girls who wanted me. Maybe they weren‚Äôt as beautiful as she was, but they had kind hearts that I never saw into. 

Well what I wish I did was ‚Äî here‚Äôs my advice: without seeming emotionally manipulative, tell her how her coldness makes you feel. Let her explain what it will take and why to get to the next step in your relationship. 

If you want something more out of your relationship and you‚Äôre unhappy, you deserve to be with someone who does make you happy. Otherwise you‚Äôre just wasting time you‚Äôll wish you had later. Don‚Äôt let the fear of not finding anyone as good as her keep you from leaving. I fell into the oneitis trap for years and I still kick myself for it 

I don‚Äôt want to seem cynical but find out if she‚Äôs cheating on you. Even the most seemingly conservative girls can be more affectionate than what you‚Äôre getting. There has to be an underlying reason why she‚Äôs holding back."
