MovieSuggestions,fjdx9y3,t3_fcrbpc,1583261024.0,"Hereditary – I gasped so loud, had my hand over my mouth for a good 2 minutes.

Midsommar – my mind was screaming wtf the whole time

Parasite – great twist and super shocking at the end, can’t say anything because I don’t wanna spoil.

Don’t Breathe – definitely gasped a few times and literally didn’t wanna breathe in the most tense moments.

Get Out – interesting plot and great twist.

Us – also an interesting plot with a shocking twist."

Anxiety,exi1wsa,t3_csy70b,1566319308.0,"Me too i live in England, just finished college and I’m 18F. I chose not to go to university because I don’t have a clue what I want to do in life still so didn’t want to commit to paying for classes in something I might not even use in the future and also I hate trying to make friends, I only made one friend in the two years I was at college. So I have to get a job, my parents have made me sign up for universal credit which means I’ll get some money while I look for jobs. But I wish they didn’t make me sign up for it because I’m getting constant messages from people at the place where you get it from asking me to come in and discuss things I don’t even know about and it’s just too much it’s suffocating. I was meant to answer a phone call from them today but I was still in bed asleep 😂 so they rescheduled it but I’m still dreading the phone call and the many meeting I have with them coming up. I’m too anxious to apply for jobs and I haven’t found anything yet that I think I could work without my anxiety making me want to literally die. 😣"
