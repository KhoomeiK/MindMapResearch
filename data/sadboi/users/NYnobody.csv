DougStanhope,fqi6fsy,t3_ggkcx4,1589391147.0,Hahahahaha trolls are having too much fun in quarantine. Did anyone see the 3 part documentary about the hunt for jerry Garcias missing finger? What a production!
depression,fol6yop,t1_fol6liw,1587856098.0,"Lol I figured, but the high feeling is so enjoyable to the point where my mind doesnt expect it to end. Thanks for your fast reply too."
depression,fol6ed2,t3_g833nc,1587855781.0,Feel free to send me any thoughts rants etc and I'll try to understand and also send one back. I feel the same way often.
depression,fnsynjp,t1_fns4te2,1587231294.0,"I agree with what others are saying but this hits home, my sisters do the same for me, it's hard to talk to them about shit things because they deal with their own, but those little gifts, or sometimes my sister will mail me old photos from our childhood, they're the only reason I'm still here so it's nice"
depression,fnqcpuy,t3_g36yxc,1587162054.0,"Amen, we're all just playin in shit"
depression,fniq4x1,t1_fniocnc,1586984390.0,"Alot of people seem to want to help and tell us its okay and just do what you love, but I agree, what if everything is just too much, or at the same time too little. You want me to work 9-5 for 30 years to enjoy the remaining years before death and that's a good life? Why cant I tap out now if I know I cant/wont contribute in ways that will benefit society. 
Life is more than video games though.... ask me what it is and I cant give you an answer. Life is just a ride."
depression,fnio4c5,t1_fngsdk1,1586983373.0,"Yea dude same, either way you know it will hurt so bad, but a suicide is even worse no matter how much you might stress to them they couldnt do anything different throughout life, fuck"
depression,fninwc0,t3_g1oozo,1586983265.0,"Hell yes. Its horrible, I feel like a failure either way, I'm alive but just waiting to die, but my family isn't grieving, but I'm wasting. Fuck everything."
depression,fmq35ja,t3_fwnmg6,1586292019.0,"Still here, I got comfortable for a while, but this weekend hit me hard. It will pass I hope. Got some yard work done today and getting seeds started. Always brings me just the slightest bit of happiness to give life to something that will feed me eventually."
depression,flyex1z,t3_frr0cp,1585600876.0,"Same situation here, I've already seen my moms reaction to my cousins death and it would be tenfold if it was me. 
Just stuck in this shit situation."
depression,fjv6pbb,t3_ff3ag9,1583623634.0,"Hey I failed too! On 2 occasions, ended up having seizures and diagnosed with a seizure disorder, so things have gotten much worse since. I also have no one that cares about me besides immediate family and that's sort of forced upon them/me. Mailbox is open if needed. But you're not really alone."
depression,fjv58oj,t3_ff3dbr,1583623266.0,"Same, have a supportive family, parents worked in psych in the past so they know how to deal with me.... but I'm just so fucking tired of being tired. Very hard to explain. One of my good friends had a really rough upbringing and he seems so strong and confident, while I'm feeling like I have no reason to feel the way I do. But it's just how it is, you're not alone, message me if you want, dont think I can help you but I can listen I guess. 
hang on though please"
depression,fjq9ow6,t3_fesdzb,1583569907.0,"Hey friend, glad I'm not alone at this late hour. Feeling a bit hopeless myself. I've never reached out to any real help though, I've just done drugs and keep pushing everything down. It's a horrible feeling. Idk if I can help, but you're not alone on a friday or Saturday at 3am where I'm at."

Epilepsy,f0tx5ny,t1_f0thn3i,1568930502.0,"Damn that is rough, I've yet to bite my tongue but I have fallen backward into an IKEA shelf, and my very first what I assume was a seizure I remember walking thru my basement then I woke up leaning on a broken statue of Mary I think, it didn't make sense for years and years"
Epilepsy,f0twm68,t1_f0tvspn,1568930228.0,Thank you for all of that helpful information. I am on keppra since I had 3+ he said I have no choice really and it would help. But i haven't monitored at all like you said I just sort of wrote down generalized feelings but now that I'm sort of understanding what's really going on I can keep a better record. I want to also try the camera monitor as well. Thanks again ♥️
