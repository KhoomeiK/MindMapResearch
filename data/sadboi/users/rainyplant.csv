Anxiety,eu3yvkl,t3_ceno4x,1563430597.0,"I have this. I have this bad.

&#x200B;

One thing I do is I try to remember my boyfriend's voice when he told me he loves me or that he tells me that it's okay. And when I start to feel insecure, I try to reassure myself in his voice. I know that if I start to try to reassure myself, it's going to devolve into self-bullying. But somehow, if I imagine it in his voice, sometimes I can feel some comfort.  Idk, thoughts?"
depression,etwawl3,t3_cdr2wh,1563261149.0,"I get this way sometimes...  I chronically don't get enough sleep or food though, so a lot of the time, my therapist tells me that I probably need to sleep and eat properly, and things will get better. Sometimes I'm definitely just depressed, but  I kind of feel like she's right some of the time."
depression,etw6y86,t3_cdspg2,1563256311.0,"Sometimes, the most comforting thing is knowing that I'm not alone if feeling depressed. Everyone always says, ""Hey, It'll get better,"" or ""Feelings come in waves. You'll feel better soon. Don't worry."" But I know that shit already. I feel like a misfit or an outcast or an alien because I feel so bad when everyone seems so happy. It helps to know that having negative feelings doesn't make me non-human, it makes me very human. The best way to convey that to someone is to tell them that sometimes you feel the same way, and that they aren't alone."
depression,ett0yic,t3_cd9p5b,1563161143.0,"I used to work in social with with a bunch of therapists, and I can tell you, they care. They care so much. They think about their clients all the time, even after work hours. I don't know your specific therapist, but my guess is, odds are that they care.

&#x200B;

It sucks that it doesn't seem to be working though. That's the thing I think you should probably think about fixing, if anything!"

GradSchool,etkrn90,t3_cc0csc,1562906349.0,"I think it's the comradery and social lubricant.

&#x200B;

Grad students have their obsessions in common, but sometimes you don't want to nerd out together, you want to sit and eat and drink together instead. But, grad students also have a hard time discussing things that aren't their research, so social lubricant (aka alcohol or weed) can help.

&#x200B;

At least that's how it is for me and a few others that I know. I'm sure this isn't the case for all grad students"
depression,et8i9uf,t3_caaupv,1562557285.0,"This is so beautiful. I'm sorry you can't be together. But the fact that people like her exist is a reason for hope, even if you don't feel hopeful right now."

Anxiety,esqs2yk,t3_c8ui30,1562208659.0,I'm 26 and I get stupid nervous about stuff all the time. Sometimes I get anxious about having to decide what to eat lol.

depression,esjvf9n,t1_esjmgsz,1562043008.0,"It really is heart-wrenching.  I don't respond that often to reddit posts but my stomach turned when I read this. I'm so sorry man.

It won't be heart-wrenching forever. Just do what you've been doing, getting through the day each day, taking care of yourself. Over time it won't be so bad. (And don't forget to do the things you love! That's the ultimate self-care!)"
depression,esjm516,t3_c82rr1,1562036250.0,"Fuck man that sucks. That's bullshit.

depression,esa8up8,t3_c6nokt,1561754180.0,"I feel sad about this too. I'm always the one to text people first or call them first.

&#x200B;

One thing that kind of helps is when I call them, I can hear their voice. If they sound happy, it makes me a little bit happy."
Anxiety,esa6ui1,t3_c6o4ss,1561752858.0,"When was the last time you asked her if she still loves you? Do you remember what her voice sounded like? Remember the intonation?  The next time you feel anxious about it, just remember the last time she reassured you of it. :)   We all feel anxious sometimes. You can use her voice in your head to soothe yourself :)"

depression,es5q5ou,t3_c62ee4,1561622586.0,"Holy shit dude. Good for you for leaving. Glad that you're now safe.

&#x200B;

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship, and couldn't get myself to leave for a long time, over a year. I felt horrible about the break up. That's just to say that I don't know exactly what you're going through, but I think I went through something kind of similar. Even though you're in a better place, it still feels bad.  And that sucks. But don't worry. Making yourself safe is the right thing to do."
depression,es5fxy9,t3_c60vtw,1561610590.0,"Hey. I'm really sorry you're going through this. It sounds really hard to feel like you don't care about anything.

I'm struggling with my summer too. I'm older (26, actually) and in grad school doing research. Summer has been kind of soul sucking, in some ways.

&#x200B;

If you could do anything this summer, what would you do?"

Or an alien. I feel like I'm an alien all the time. Like a kind of unpleasant creature.

For some reason I have a hard time believing other people are aliens though. Do you feel the alien thing?"

Anxiety,es59td3,t3_c5xn2y,1561605270.0,"Literally tearing up reading this :) I'm super happy for you, and this gives me a lot of hope to keep trying myself!

I've had pretty bad social anxiety and depression on and off for years and years now. I started seeing a therapist a few months ago, and tbh sometimes it's just so hard and I worry that none of it will pay off. This really gives me hope.

What's Daylio? How did it help you? :D"
depression,es59hke,t3_c5zqy5,1561605018.0,That's so wonderful :) This makes me happy to hear!
depression,es4ruz6,t3_c5ty1g,1561592254.0,whatup friend. I'm a grad student so I just obsess about questions that most people don't give a shit about. I feel you in feeling like you're too weird to be loved. I feel it. I feel it hard.
depression,es4rly4,t1_es4847z,1561592065.0,"idk man. I've been trying to start easy and try to remember what foods and music and stuff I like, but it's not easy when I don't really feel excited by anything.

What's your fav article of clothing? lol"
depression,es4rg82,t3_c5tff2,1561591943.0,"Good for you for accepting love! That's a really beautiful thing.

&#x200B;

I think it's super scary to accept love from someone else and to love them back. I start to feel weird when I realize that I love someone. I start to feel dependent and  crave their attention, so I feel you when you say that you're alarmed about being dependent. I feel kind of sick and disgusted with myself to be honest.  I'm trying to figure out how to be in love without being dependent but I'm having a hard time.

&#x200B;

I want to mention something. Just because his door is closed doesn't mean that he's rejecting you. Just because he hasn't turned in his application to officially move in doesn't mean that he's rejecting you. I know you didn't say that, but it seems implied in what you wrote, and I wanted to challenge that a bit."
depression,es47nep,t1_es3x8m2,1561578828.0,"I agree, this is such a valuable idea. Depression is NOT me. Depression is NOT you.

  
It just get's hard when you live in depression for so long that you don't remember who you are anymore.  Then, Depression IS me...

Know what I'm sayin? How do you separate yourself from the depression?"
depression,es46y96,t3_c5pl27,1561578404.0,I feel that too.  Sometimes I can't even really answer the question of what food I like.  I just lose all sense of self...

Sometimes people ask me what's wrong and before I know it, I've just sort of trembled in silence for 2 minutes. I've been told that it can be annoying because it seems like I devolve into a child who can't speak or communicate. I feel like now I have this extra hurdle. I have to find a way to palatably convey my negative emotions ON TOP OF coaxing myself into expressing how I feel to begin with! It only feels like it's getting harder and harder...  It doesn't help that it feels like I'm just annoying people when I try to express how I feel. I already feel like a burden on people. This only makes it worse..."

And, I don't know anything about you expect for what you posted here. **I want you to know that I feel a bit less alone after reading what you wrote. Thanks.**

Sometimes I see posts like this and I want to write something encouraging or happy, but I also don't like being ""jollied up"" by others when I feel like this, and honestly, I don't have the energy to write something peppy.

I talked to my parents (almost 9 years after I left the house) about how I was planning to get a therapist, and the first thing she said was, ""You're not depressed. You're just not sleeping enough.
