It more begs the question on how old you are, mainly because if you are still young then your mother may not allow you to have some things that may symbolise “acting black” (however she phrased it)

In the end, your mother is your mother, she’ll love you no matter what, and I think you should have a conversation with her about this, seeing as it is your identity and you deserve to have it in your life.

Don’t accuse her Of being racist though otherwise she would just deny it"
