I actually have free time for the first time in probably 2 years. I am playing the Sims and watching Netflix *just because* which is HUGE for me. I can enjoy alcohol and marijuana again without having to worry about getting up early the next day.

One of my fitness coaches puts it this way: one pound of fat is 3500 calories. If you eat in a calorie deficit of 500 calories every day, you will lose one pound per week. 

Try tracking your calories for a little while. A food scale is important to have, so try and get your hands on one if you can. Make sure your are getting enough lean protein. You might hear “one gram of protein for one pound of body weight”, but 140g of protein is A LOT, so honestly just shoot for around 100g if you can. Veggies, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats. I’m sure you know the drill. Counting macros might be beneficial to make sure you’re not over eating carbs. Every body reacts a little bit differently so it might take some time to figure out what works best for you. 

Hang in there.

Edit: i was also going to say, under-eating is just as detrimental as over eating, so really try to get your calories in!! You should never go under 1200cal. When i was exercising the lowest i went was 1500."
