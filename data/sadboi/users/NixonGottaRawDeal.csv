we don’t sit around as guys and talk about sex, and if we do it’s very rare. then it’s even more rare that someone is *purposely* being derogatory to the female. when they do tho, it’s not okay and something is normally said.

there was no “band of brothers” mentality about dealing with emotions, sex, etc. we figure it out on our own. we are not taught by other men how to “be a man” yet it’s so engrained in us that we subconsciously tell ourselves it to a point it causes probably psychological harm.
