Have you talked to their parents about that? Because that’s a situation that can and should be reported to CPS. When were you going to report that? You’re only thinking about reporting it now because you’re angry and want to retaliate, instead of because there’s an effing THREE YEAR OLD roaming around alone and you’re worried for her safety. 

There’s a reason CPS doesn’t encourage people to talk to the other party before reporting. It’s safer for the reporter and also the abused if the abuser is blindsided by it. They have less of a chance to prevent the abused from talking, and they have less of a chance to retaliate against the reporter. Believe me, everyone is safer by the system working this way.

Now, I get it that you’re angry. It’s a terribly scary and frustrating place to be. Just be honest with the caseworker and everything will be fine. It’s GOOD that you have unsafe places inaccessible to your child. It’s fine that you let your kid play in the living room and make a mess in there as kids do. The caseworker will see that you’re doing your best for your kid and the case will be closed.

And FFS instead of spending time trying to get revenge on these people, focus on your wife. She clearly needs you right now. Quit making such a big deal out of this because that puts more stress on her and she doesn’t need it. Neither does your child."

truechildfree,fpv91a1,t3_gfpd74,1588938851.0,"No. I’ve never wanted kids. From a young age I remember watching my parents struggle with everything and I wondered why they decided to have me (I knew what abortion was by this point and also knew that babies were put up for adoption). Their lives would have been so much easier if they didn’t have me. 

As I got older and things like sexual abuse, depression, anxiety found their way to me I didn’t want kids. I didn’t want to give them a life like mine.. I saw so many very young people (a girl in my 8th grade class got pregnant and every school year after that had at least one) having babies and all I could think was “don’t they know they don’t have to do that? Why would they go through that?” 

As I got a little older I was involved with some predatory people and my first instincts were “do whatever it takes to not get pregnant” and luckily I never did. 

Now as my 30th birthday approaches and I’m living with the love of my life, I couldn’t imagine brining a child into this world. There are so many things that are going to cause so much suffering within the next few generations. I love my nephews but I really worry about the world they’re growing up in and the world they’ll live in as adults...Then there are so many kids that already need someone and aren’t getting the help they need.... 

I can’t even imagine being tied down with kids. Most of the parents I know are miserable. I’ve seen a baby be born and I’d never want to go through that myself. I don’t see childbirth and motherhood as something I’d ever want. I get stressed out when my ball python won’t eat.. I’d be a basket case with a human child I’m responsible for constantly. Finding a kennel for my dogs when I go on vacation is hard enough. It’s just not for me and that’s ok."

PlusSize,fpv7kbm,t3_gfdzpv,1588937558.0,"My family has always had a bad relationship with food. When my siblings and I were young we’d take a bag of Doritos, grate half a block of cheese on it, microwave to melt the cheese and then dip the nachos into sour cream, as a snack between lunch and dinner. We always had tons of soda, my stepmom worked at a grocery store and they’d let her buy flats of soda (like 36 cans) for super cheap; she’d buy them 4 at a time. We always had candy and gallons of ice cream and shit... So naturally after puberty hit I started to really gain weight. (My dad and stepmom are both very heavy and so are their parents.) well sophomore year rolls around and I decide I don’t want to be chubby anymore. The only thing I can think of is to be what I call “basically anorexic”. I eat two oranges throughout the day and maybe a cup serving of whatever is for dinner. I ate that way for months. Instead of being concerned, the whole family complimented me on losing weight. I was 14/15. I didn’t hide what I was doing. They’d always made comments on my body and that didn’t change, but more of the comments were positive for once. 

Luckily I had friends who cared enough to get me to understand that eating like that wasn’t good. Unfortunately, I went right back into eating horribly like my family did and major overeating. By the time I graduated I was wearing Juniors XL clothes on my 5’3” frame. 

I still don’t like oranges and that was 15 years ago."

If they’ve really changed and are making amends for the pain they’ve caused and not behaving that way anymore, go for it.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fptozxi,t3_gf84ij,1588895395.0,"So I have a small wallet, a smallet if you will, and I generally only keep my license and Costco card in there. (I have a larger wallet that I keep in my purse that has all the other wallet stuff in it) Normally I keep my smallet in the console of my car so that anytime I go anywhere I have my ID. It’s important to note that last fall I moved from my home state to my SOs home state. I waited to change it over to new state because I had a thing on my record in my home state that I was waiting to clear... Anyway I also realized I’d lost my SS card and you need one to get that newfangled Real ID, so I went down to the closest SS office and waited 4 hours to get a new one sent to my new address. Eventually the new SS card arrived so I immediately put it inside my smallet, you know, so it wouldn’t get lost. Then we left to go somewhere so I put my smallet back in the car like usual. I had both an ID and a drivers license, usually one goes into SO wallet and one into mine but at this point I put both in my smallet to take to the DMV... 

A week or so goes by and we finally have time to go to the DMV. I’m going around the house collecting proof of address and such and go out to the car to check my smallet. It’s gone. Now the only people who get into my car are me and SO, so it’s not like some random could have stolen it. I also am very very careful about always locking the car, even in my driveway. SO is too. So I go inside and ask him if he’s seen the smallet incase I brought it inside and forgot. He says he hasn’t seen it. We look everywhere, starting with the places I usually put it (namely the console in the car got checked at least 5 times between us meaning everything was taken out and put back). It’s nowhere to be found. I find this super frustrating because I’m the type of person that puts things in one place. Like if my smallet isn’t in the car, it’s in my pocket/purse or it’s on the kitchen counter. (Also super frustrating because it’s a loop of not being able to replace ID without SS card and vice versa) We looked for days and days. I called local PD and all the stores I’d been to. I posted rewards on fb, here, and Craigslist. Nothing but scammers. Worst part is I don’t really know when I lost it because it’s not like I check everyday to make sure it’s still in the console. So about every other day I check the car again to make sure it didn’t get stuck somewhere and suddenly came loose or something.

One day, after it’s been gone about a month, I’m driving along and SO reaches into that console to get something and.. pulls out my smallet. I was so relieved I could have cried. But I know for definite sure that it was not in that console after I noticed it missing. Where did it go? Idk but it was there, then gone, and suddenly there again. Everything intact. I went to the DMV two days later, which is good because the next week everything shut down over Covid."

As a bicyclist there’s no way in hell I’d want to ride my bike in all that traffic and madness. Maybe if there was a way to keep a good distance between the bikes and cars. And probably between the pedestrians and bikes as well. I could see drunk people thinking it’s funny to get into bicyclists way or knocking people off their bikes, possibly into traffic...."

All of our dogs get kicked out of the room when we have sex because they’re major cockblocks. Sometimes I masturbate with them around but they don’t bother me.

As soon as the bars are too small for him to slip through it’ll come out because I don’t want him to get stuck in it. 

Honestly though he is the most happy, chill, exploring ball I’ve ever had. Nothing seems to bother him."

As soon as he gets a little bigger he’ll get a bigger skull like my other (full grown) ball has. When he’s rolled up into a ball he takes up maybe 1/3 of the space inside there. I’m planning on getting more plants but I can’t find any that aren’t from the craft store and idk if those are safe as far as chemicals and stuff. Hopefully after the virus I’ll be able to find him some more cool things but rn he’s healthy and very happy as far as I can tell. We keep the room dark all the time and I only opened the blinds so I could take a pic, it usually is pretty dark in the room but I got him from a bright well lit reptile store and he’s never reacted poorly to lights of any kind."

On the right is his Jeep and his new waterfall which he just loves. He’s a pretty active little guy and it’s been such a pleasure seeing him roam around in this tank because we just bought it and set it up for him last week and he really seems to be liking the changes.
