Relief from that requires getting out of your head and expanding your perspective and not stewing in victhimhood. I don't just know what BPD is, I have it and am recovering from it. You mention ""equality"" in your headline, you are not unequal just because there are unflattering perspectives that could be applied to you. That's the point. 

Check your anger, check your privilege, and do the work if you actually want to get better."

BPD,fq7hiqz,t1_fq7fnj2,1589146465.0,"You are continuing to miss the point. You are trapped in your anger and victimhood and what will help you is to step outside of that and give compassion and empathy to others who need it just as much, if not more. You framed your grievance as an issue of ""equality"", the content of your post was about gendered perceptions of BPD sufferers. So yes, you were talking about genders. Women who suffer BPD have as bad a rep as well. It's not fair for either, no one here is disputing that. No one here is disputing that it's unfair to paint any sufferer as abusive or a monster with such a broad brush. But 

I am not asking for your compassion or empathy for me, I am asking that you learn to lead with that, rather than anger and shame. You are trapping yourself and it is unnecessary. It's not about my pain (I'm not experiencing pain) and it's not that your pain is unimportant, it's that you're falsely attributing it to a lack of equality between genders, in particular as it pertains to BPD. You are taking something personally that is not personal and for no reason at all other than it's a programmed response that you have to do the work to unprogram. For your own good. 

That rage you feel over ""false accusations"" applies to everyone on earth. There isn't an identification on this planet that hasn't been stereotyped, falsely accused in some way, or ostracized in one form or another. The difference is, you have hurt feelings over a small misconception in a microcosm that isn't doing you tangible harm. My point was to illustrate that the group you feel you're unequal to, experiences that type of harm but on a much larger scale.

A key component to true recovery is to get out of your own head and acknowledge when your anger is disproportionate, inappropriate, and unnecessary. Part of how to do that is to put it in a larger perspective."
BPD,fq7diia,t1_fq717ih,1589144984.0,"Woah, okay, you've missed the point. It was about gender, as it relates to BPD, but yes gender. It's important to acknowledge that as a man, the discrimination you experience isn't comparable to the discrimination non-white, non-male, non-hetero people face. It hurts your feelings (papercut), it costs them lives (gutting).

You feel threatened, and that's normal, now remember that the commenter you're addressing who is a black trans woman feels that way (and likely more) every time she leaves her home, and frankly, when she logs onto the internet. Yes, the world in some areas is becoming more friendly in that regard, but the fact that individuals like yourself feel the level of anger you experience at feeling discriminated against shows that we have a long way to go.

When trying to recover from BPD, yes you are worthy of a certain level of empathy and compassion to get better, but you have to acknowledge your blind spots along the way and also increase your empathy and compassion for others, whether they show it or not (as I said in my initial response.)

You are not doing that right now. You do not get to expect compassion and empathy when you are unwilling to give it to others. Do make this a priority and I can almost guarantee your symptoms will alleviate."
BPD,fq7bhr7,t1_fq7ao9j,1589144244.0,"I think you're spot on. And it's unfortunate that that lack of support system leads men/white people/heteros etc. to feel like they need to be validated and listened to by the aggrieved who are also looking to be heard and validated (and who are objectively, at this point in time more entitled to being heard and validated.) 

Here's hoping these conversations continue to chip away at that impulse and leads to the privileged stepping back for a change."
BPD,fq7al5a,t1_fq6txga,1589143912.0,"It is asking a lot for people in a disadvantaged position to prioritize your sensitivities. It's natural to crave that type of kind, sensitive interaction, but marginalized people are exhausted just trying to go about their lives in a world that was not designed in their favor and to expect patience and compassion while trying to educate people on the issues that are unique to them is what's unfair. What's more fair is accepting that you, in your privileged position, will have to be uncomfortable and suffer through harshness and rash judgments. As I said in an earlier comment, that kind of harshness and rash judgment and suffering is a matter of course for POC, LGBTQIA, women, non-christians, etc. purely on the basis of that part of their identity. 

You're not losing jobs over insensitivity, you're not risking being shot in the street over insensitivity. Your livelihood is not at stake, your ego is.  And that's a sacrifice that can and should be made.

I do agree that ultimately affection and love are the cure, but that starts with the privileged extending that affection and love to the communities hurt by our privilege by holding space, not taking things personally, or expecting patience and then by educating our white, male, christian, hetero circles and making them less hostile territories for others. We can handle accusations and hurt feelings individually, but collectively we need spaces that don't prioritize privileged feelings over  POC, LGBTQIA, women, non-christian anger."

I do think it's a problem when, in an attempt to be compassionate, we end up validating unhealthy behaviors and mindsets. Or when compassion offers no alternatives or challenges to help the person suffering advance further."

BPD,fq6d645,t1_fq6buz3,1589129236.0,"It is unfortunate when you're just a person minding your own business and you feel like you end up lumped in with others who display egregious behavior. But when women or POC or any other marginalized group does this to a white/straight/man/etc. it's out of a survival instinct. Hold space and respect the need for self preservation, and try not to internalize it as an indictment of you specifically. The best thing you can do is work toward educating other men about the effects white supremacy, patriarchy, homophobia (because they all belong to the same systems. hello, intersectionality) have on the targeted groups. Take your personal feelings out of the equation and use your position to improve things for everyone. No one's free, unless we're all free (wish I remembered who originally said that so I could attribute. regardless, I take no credit.)

Realizing, in my case as a BPD sufferer, that nearly all of my victimhood was self-imposed and recognizing the ways people truly are victimized through no fault of their own went a long way toward me breaking the thought patterns that kept me trapped in fear, anxiety, shame, etc."
BPD,fq6apgr,t3_ggzp77,1589127879.0,"BPD makes it very difficult to not take things personally. My favorite way to illustrate this is that the disorder makes us perceive papercuts as guttings. Understand that you are personalizing a phenomenon that is not personal. You don't have to let dominant perceptions contribute to your shame. You shouldn't. It's not targeted at you personally. 

It's also important for you to understand, this feeling you have of being singled out, that is how actual minority groups (POC, LGBTQIA, women, religious minorities, any I've left out) feel as a matter of course. Objectively speaking, the world we live in was designed for white, straight, ""Christian"" men and built by exploiting the labor of, in the U.S. specifically (of course elsewhere, but I'm no history expert. Just an american), black women and men, allowing white women the illusion of parity in exchange for upholding this system. 

You feeling singled out is largely due to the fact that people who have historically not held a platform wide enough for it to be reached globally, in the mainstream, now have the ability to share their experiences. It runs counter to what we have been taught about how equality works (""slavery and segregation ended. now all is fair"" ""women can vote and work. now all is fair"" which, hello, after centuries of abuse and exploitation it's going to take a hell of a lot more than that to correct the biases born from those practices.) This new information brings forth the knowledge that we have all been (mostly) inadvertently complicit in upholding those structures, but you know that you as an individual never had that intent and you feel defensive as a result. 

This is understandable, but do work toward understanding that attempts to correct centuries of imbalance are not personal toward you. It's not to make you, the individual, feel shame or guilt. It's to allow you the knowledge necessary to reject those systems in meaningful ways. 

Work toward not letting personal hurt feelings (papercuts) prevent you from seeing the unfairness others experience in much larger, far more damaging ways. Work towards not feeling victimized by those who have actually been victims in real, significant, life-threatening ways finally having a say. You are right that it isn't fair to be stereotyped as an aggressor just because you're a man, but understand that that standard did not begin with women. Men as an institution have set the paradigms of what is acceptable masculine and feminine behavior, and men have been left as trapped by it as women (while also receiving benefits that women generally don't receive.) 

Work toward understanding that when women stereotype men, it's in a misguided attempt to correct an imbalance and that it isn't personal. It's rooted in the same types of fear, pain, and shame you experience as well. Give the compassion, empathy, and nuance you wish to receive. You may or may not receive it back, but that's the other person's failure and something they need to work to find. You'll at least be able to go forward feeling certain that you've done the right thing, and doing that will bring you relief from your shame. Shame comes from within and can only be healed through your actions being aligned with your true values. Don't depend on others to treat you the way you wish to be treated, that's out of your control. But don't let that stop you from treating others with the kindness and understanding you want, because that is fully within your control. 

I hope this was helpful. Be kind to yourself and don't internalize shame that doesn't belong to you."
BPD,fpn6ot6,t1_fpn5b5i,1588752111.0,"I have tried, and successfully do, understand about the anger and framing. As I mentioned, I am guilty of doing the vilifying myself. This all comes from a ""it takes one to know one"" view.

This post is actually less directed at people with sensitivities making themselves more prone to black and white thinking (I.e. BPD) and more toward otherwise ""normal"" people who choose not to grasp that not everyone has the same level of social grace or stellar communication skills and who don't use their socially superior (at least in their minds) position to have a little compassion and patience for those who don't.

Though I do think, and this is the point that motivates the post, that we give too much room for people (BPD and not) to feel comfortable tearing someone apart for really minor offenses and have gotten way too comfortable labelling really excusable lapses in perfect social posturing as ""toxic"" and in extreme cases ""abuse."" I think we're at a point where we validate all feelings, especially anger, so much that it keeps people (BPD or not) stuck in their self-righteous distortions for way longer than is actually helpful. Speaking firsthand on that account. 

I just don't see a lot of talk centering around acknowledging (as opposed to validating) frustration or anger with another person without needing to justify it with blame and I think it would do everyone a lot of good if we had more of that (BPD or not.)"
BPD,fpmehwn,t1_fpmdxif,1588731320.0,"Right!? Like it's fine to address things with curiosity with an aim toward processing or understanding. It's also totally fine to discuss your experiences, but the damning, mean-spirited framing that tends to be the dominant mode is what gets me.

BPD,fpmcj8d,t3_geatue,1588730118.0,"I've experienced this many times on and off over the years. The only thing that's helped me is to continue to orient my thoughts toward acceptingt that I cannot change anything in this scenario except how I react. I can't change what's happened, I can't change how my former friends think or talk about me. I also don't know if they're even thinking about me, which is painful in a sense but can also be freeing. 

You don't need to punish yourself for your past or feel like you have to live in a way that aligns with how other people might see you. It's not fair for other people to cling to one idea of who a person is, but they do sometimes and there's nothing you or I can do about it, except to be better than that. Don't pigeonhole yourself because you had to stumble a bit more to get to where others are more easily. 

And recognize that unless you come face to face with irrefutable proof they're laughing at you, you don't need to consider it a possibility. And if you do come face to face with that irrefutable proof, you can own what you did with grace, apologize sincerely (because you clearly feel genuine remorse), and know that that is more than good enough. 

Everyone plays a role in dynamics. Some personalities just bring out the worst in each other and the blame spreads evenly. Sometimes one person is solely responsible and if that's you, at least you had the courage necessary to accept that truth and are seeking ways to do better. 

How you physically do that, is every time you catch yourself ruminating or spiraling is you stop and tell yourself (out loud is best, but in your head or on paper works too) that that is in the past, it is unchangeable, you have a life that deserves your attention now, and then shift your attention to a hobby, book, tv show, podcast, music, etc. Cultivate something meaningful and beautiful now, because now is all you have.

BPD,fp3i8l6,t1_fp3gzc6,1588279760.0,"Nothing will give you contentment until you give yourself permission to find it. When I said discord I didn't mean the platform (wasn't even aware there was one, I meant people arguing about everything a person could possibly argue about). 

That's okay, they don't like you. Moving on because your priority is not getting other people to like you, it's getting you to like you. You don't need an audience or feedback for that, despite how it feels. 

You need to find a way to detach emotionally from your trauma. I am not an expert and cannot reasonably advise you on how exactly to do that, but you don't have to live in the pain you have experienced (I'm assuming this is in the past, forgive me if I've misread). I would advise finding a therapist on a service like Talkspace as a first step to address it. Once you have someone reliable who can give you sound medical advice, you can do the work to uncover the things that might make you happy. But the constantly telling yourself that you can't, that you're stuck, that you're traumatized, that you're numb is only embedding those ideas in your head. It's all just storytelling. You have to reframe what your emotional state is, label it neutrally. You feel numb. Feelings aren't facts. You don't feel grateful. Feelings aren't facts. You are highly sensitive, nothing wrong with that, especially since you're aware which means you can find ways to cope without derailing your life. 

Feeling things intensely has produced some of the greatest art and music the world has ever known. Proof that it isn't inherently a bad thing. It's only a negative if you choose not to make the most of it. And making the most of it does not require you to have artistic abilities or to be famous or beloved. It just requires you to build and create and honor what comes from that no matter how it looks to yourself or others. Let things be what they are and love them anyway, including yourself."

Yes, it feels good to be understood, but that is very rare even for people who don't have the sensitivities we do as people with BPD. What feels better is to know you aren't understood and to know that that is perfectly okay. 

A truth that I happen to like now that I've found it, is that there are so many things in this world that excite me and bring me contentment, and dare I say, joy. The best part about those things is they exist and I can enjoy them independent of my past, independent of whether or not anyone understands me, independent of anyone else's opinion of me. The things I love the most and enjoy the most exist and I have access to them and no one can take them from me without my permission and I'm not giving it. I don't have to punish myself for everything I've done. If I did, then everyone I've ever known would also have to apologize and suffer for the things that they've done and that just seems ridiculous, doesn't it?

I love rock 'n' roll, I love beer, I love spicy food, I love the beach, I love to learn about various topics, I like learning how to make things with my hands. These are mine whenever I choose to give them my time/attention/money and no one can take them from me. You need to find your version of these things.

If you have no idea where to start, remember what you enjoyed as a kid. If you have no such memory then start from scratch. Assess the things you find funny, or beautiful, or exciting, or amusing. Research them (wikipedia is a fine place to start for these purposes), read blogs relating to them, listen to/watch things with them/about them, when you're stable enough maybe engage with online communities about them (I would hesitate on inviting others into your love until you're stable enough to handle discord because it exists everywhere and right now even I can't deal with that.)

You don't need to protect yourself, the world isn't so predatory. You don't need to punish yourself, we all have lessons to learn and we learn them at different times.

If you can try to hold that perspective (easier said than done), I think it can go a long way as well as not judging or rejecting your feelings.

But to think that knowingly hurting people is a symptom is a complete misunderstanding.

It does bother me that all behavior gets treated like they're pathological. Like, wanting someone to be interested in you and then deciding you aren't interested is just part of being a person. There's no need to tell a more dramatic story about it to yourself or others. 

That's something I realized has kept me stuck (until very recently) was the way I'd frame my experiences in my own head, the stories I told about them. Instead of ""we grew apart/didn't understand each other/were young so it was messy"" it was all about how ""I had this experience that led me to this behavior and they were withholding because of X event in their life.""

I'm just trying to exist and build and learn and grow. Nothing is good or bad unless I choose to see it that way and that choice is too much for me to handle right now, so I'm choosing to just be curious and learn and trusting things will level out through that.

It's a difficult thing to cultivate, but you must find a way to forgive yourself (and your family if you choose, there is no right answer there) so you can make clear-headed decisions.

Once you work on loving yourself (because you are loveable, even if you didn't have a loving boyfriend to confirm it), you'll have a clearer sense of what you'd really rather do, whether that's staying with your family or moving in with your boyfriend. 

The fact that you are able to look back at your past actions with a critical eye is amazing. Many people can't do that. Now you just have to accept the past as a part of your history and not be burdened with it. It's great to have around as a guide, but your life today deserves your full attention. You deserve to give your present, thoughtful, aware self your attention. Feel proud of yourself for how far you've come."

I'm open to it changing because as long as I'm enjoying myself, able to support myself and not being tied to labels or centering my identity around what I do, there's no problem. 

Don't fret. You don't need to know what you want to do forever. Just focus on what you want to do right now, obtain useful skills because they will be transferrable to other fields and careers if you feel like moving around, and go easy on yourself."

The implied lack of consent and reciprocity is a big, scary red flag. It should be treated the same way the emotional lability and suicidal ideation is, something that exists that needs to be (compassionately) challenged when it flares and not given merit outside of being a sometimes fact of the disorder."
BPD,foh936a,t3_g7g8br,1587762070.0,"I had never heard of that until this subreddit and I've knowingly been with BPD for close to 10 years. When I looked it up I found an article defending the concept and talking about how to have healthy boundaries with an FP and I think that's a good first step, but it doesn't seem super helpful to not challenge the notion of having one at all, from my perspective.

The article really smacked of a kind of learned helpless, ""everything I think is valid therefore shouldn't be challenged,"" type of occurrence that I think sufferers would be better off working past it in themselves. Like, yeah, validating your feelings is absolutely important and necessary but only if it comes with a healthy amount of questioning so you're not further cementing maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors. I hate to be judgemental of anything that brings people comfort, I just wish there was a bit more accepting of certain comforts being a short-term strategy rather than something you normalize as a long-term function."
BPD,foh8c6z,t1_foh6s14,1587761728.0,"Yeah, I guess I'm a bit old to be in the loop on tumblr-based things.

To be honest, I'm fine with younger sufferers of BPD using the term/concept if it's helpful, but it does feel a bit juvenile and I worry for people around my age adopting that idea."

BPD,fogfom1,t3_g7d30v,1587751982.0,"That's been fairly typical of my experience trying to get help. I've had maybe 3 good therapists out of like 10. Just keep showing up in spite of your feelings. Let yourself be depressed, don't try to force yourself to feel better. Read up on distress tolerance to get you to a baseline where you can start enjoying things again. 

Right now I'm grappling with the idea that maybe I'll never be able to have close friendships because people who can relate to me are few and far between and I'm realizing that might be okay for the most part. I anticipate it will be hard some days, but I don't need to curse myself just because I can't relate well to most people.

I know you were looking for friendly chats or memes, but right now I'm in such a coping mindset this is all I can offer and I hope it's of some value to you to know you're not alone.

I'm currently looking into ways I can be okay on my own and not feel like I need people or presence outside of myself to feel good. Tall order, but I am ultimately the only person I can rely on and I need to figure out how, my life depends on it."

My response was always, ""If I knew how to do that, I'd be doing it already, any advice?"" and usually, of course, they had none because they didn't know what it felt like to be overly sensitive. 

It's a skill I had to learn."
BPD,fo3ri25,t1_fo3oajy,1587491754.0,"Sorry, I didn't write that super clearly. By starting at a place of ""this criticism is necessary for my growth"", I was able to really listen and understand what I was being criticized for. 

The more I did that, the more differing views I was exposed to instead of hiding away from anything that made me uncomfortable. Having all of these different perspectives then made it easier (\*IMPORTANT\* after being clear on what my true values are outside of the disorder, because like you said just because I have BPD doesn't mean everything I think and feel is wrong) to then see which of them actually resonated and that I ought to consider despite the discomfort, and which didn't really align with my long-term goals or priorities and, when looked at with a clearer head, were actually pretty poorly adapted themselves. 

The best advice I can offer on the tug of war is to not assign ""right, wrong, good, or bad"" to ANYTHING you hear for a while. Everything is just what it is. Nothing more, nothing less. Simultaneously, figure out what type of person you believe you are or wish to be outside of disordered behavior (meditation, journaling, DBT/CBT have all helped me with this clarity and I'm happy to get more specific if you need). Once you're clear on what is truly important to you and the person you want to be, then go back and start assessing criticisms you get by asking ""will adopting this bring me closer to my values, or take me further from them?""

I hope this helps."
BPD,fo3o0nz,t3_dszer2,1587490103.0,This was a great read and I will be saving this as something to remind myself on less certain days. Very happy for you! It's such a relief when you're able to experience regulation.
BPD,fo3n8gw,t3_ffm5i4,1587489727.0,"I'm new here. I hope I can help by offering you this: the fact that you recognize that there is much to live for is a great starting place. List the things you believe are worth living for and do whatever you can to keep your mind and focus on them. Everything else is just noise. 

I would suggest that using denial as a coping mechanism is doing you a greater disservice (I say this as someone who did that for a long time). The more matter-of-fact you can be with yourself about your behavior and thought patterns, the less power the fear of your disorder can have over you. You're disordered, I'm disordered, people who are not specifically BPD are disordered to some extent. This isn't meant to excuse harmful behavior, but you have to accept that we all have some burden in life and this happens to be yours. What you've done in the past should only be viewed as a tool to guide your future behavior that's more in line with your true values (which you should spend some time getting clear on, if you aren't already) and away from more automatic responses. 

DBT/CBT, stoicism, mindfulness, and meditation are the tools that have helped me reorient my thinking to a more balanced, compassionate, thoughtful place, but I'm sure there are others if those don't work for you. 

There's no stopping overnight. It is a life's work, but the sooner you start exploring some type of coping mechanism (the ones listed above are the only ones I'm comfortable vouching for as they've worked for me), the sooner you will start to feel relief and realize that you don't need to be perfect all at once or have all the answers right away. No one does, disordered or not. Growth is necessary and always a process. Just start. With compassion for yourself and no judgment of your past/present behavior. You know life is worth living and you're worth living in it."
BPD,fo3m8tl,t3_fmsdcw,1587489260.0,"I'm new here. I know this post is a month old, but the only thing you can do is use DBT/CBT, stoicism, mindfulness, and/or meditation specifically to train your brain into more compassion for yourself and to reduce your desire to be perfect (it's impossible and an effort that's reinforcing your poor relationship with yourself and zapping your genuine motivation). 

Don't worry about what the disorder MAY do. The future doesn't exist yet so it's futile worrying over it. Keep your mind on the fact that you love making and fixing watches! Feel the warmth that comes from engaging in the activities you enjoy and lose the weight of fear over things that aren't in your control (in this case, the future).

 There's truly no such thing as failure, it's all vanity bullshit meant to motivate certain types and instill fear in others and it does a disservice to us all by creating separation from ourselves and what brings us joy. The joy you feel making watches is real and lives within you and can never be taken away, the fear of failure is a construct that exists outside of yourself and you don't have to adhere to it. Easier said than done, but your life and happiness depends on you working toward that."

Another positive I've found in it for myself was that I've always been more willing to take everyone else's perspective at its word and write my own off because of my historically disordered thinking. The more I open up to criticism for the first reason, the better able I am to discern how I genuinely appraise things instead of allowing my view to get swept up in someone else's because with more information comes more understanding, etc. I've worked on thinking of it as just being data and not an indictment of my entire being.

Most bad behavior is rooted in some type of pain or just poor learned behavior. I essentially think that we'd all be a lot better off if we weren't so quick to just write people off as ""just assholes"", yes they can be but they aren't JUST that. You can have your tolerance level wherever it's comfortable, but it is a problem to deny others their humanity by calling them ""just"" anything."

Call back if you feel like you need to again."" Hang up. One time it was so bad the woman literally said she wouldn't help me if I wouldn't listen to er, when she hadn't even finished listening to me.

There is very little advice with regard to how to find peace in the lack of visible progress. That's why I asked what I asked.

In terms of making friends, you can always try to make friends, but whether others ultimately want to be your friend is up to them and out of your control and may not happen for a variety of reasons you may never understand or be aware of.

That's what drives me bonkers. 

One minute they're posting about being kind to all because you don't know how they suffer and then the next they're liking some post about ""toxic friends to get rid of."" It's not that I have a problem with people being selective about what behaviors they'll tolerate in their friendships, it's that the toxic label is so dehumanizing and completely ignores the pain, and often, lack of awareness that drives the ""toxic"" behaviors that are so abhorrent the exhibitor must be banished.

At the moment, what I find most helpful is not to try and guess at or assume another person's comfort level, their boundaries and how they set them are their own responsibility. My responsibility is to myself and maintaining my own comfort level. If I feel uncomfortable with divulging too much information, that's a note to myself to adjust what and how much I share and with who because that is what I have control over. I can't control how someone else responds or reacts, but I am more than happy to respect boundaries and ask plainly (with no expectation that they will answer to appease me) what their boundaries are so that I don't inadvertently cross them. 

And even then, you'll encounter people who find direct interactions like that stitled and odd and THAT may be the cause of their discomfort. When that's the case all you can do is apologize and not cross that line again. But you'll make yourself crazy constantly trying to intuit what's okay with who and when so either ask or just check in with yourself and determine where your comfort lies and go from there.

Stoicism, mindfulness, CBT/DBT, and meditation are the most effective tools I've encountered for getting me back to living now. The only things deserving of your attention are your thoughts and feelings because they're in your control and what you're doing in the very specific moment you're living in because again, that's where you are now. There is no changing what's already happened and there's no sense in being confronted about your past behavior at a future date because it hasn't happened and may not happen. Don't torture yourself in the present over something that can't be changed OR over something that hasn't happened.

Be proud of yourself for your capacity for growth. You've made deliberate choices to improve and that's far more impressive than someone who has a natural aptitude for acceptable behavior. You have a unique perspective and ability for compassion that those who have always behaved in ways that are socially acceptable don't have. Your experience is valuable.

Another thing that does help when I just can't escape the worry over future confrontation is to know that I have the ability to say honestly and matter-of-factly to whoever may potentially bring up embarrassing memories that I have learned from my behavior chose to do better.

But of course what they meant was that it wasn't on the person who's been hurt to absolve me, the hurter, but for me to work it out on my own and leave it in the past. Let the other person hate me if they choose because I had already done what I'd done. I just often suffer from a desire to be liked and feeling like I can't like myself if I've hurt someone. 

Today though I feel like it's only fair to let myself be hated for what I've done, if that's the choice they've made. I need to accept myself and make good choices either way, so what's the use in fretting over it?

I've never actually spoken to anyone who I know also had BPD and I regret not doing so sooner. Not feeling alone is helpful enough, but when paired with thoughtful insight makes me feel so much more hopeful about my prospects."
