We've now seen Melanie & Ian (repeatedly) and Janet and Summer at least twice. What is their agenda? They can't be trying to garner support for her, so what is it? Straight up publicity for themselves? (Edit: Are they getting paid?)

Melanie and Ian - maybe to make it clear they are not involved in whatever went down even if they can't really say what it was? Lots of word salad.

Janis and Summer - their motivation is totally unclear. Without any information about the children's whereabouts why go on the interview circuit? None of them are sympathetic figures and they're not making LVD's situation any better - in fact they might be damaging it further in the public eye if that is even possible.

My mother made most of my clothes with a few new items purchased at the beginning of the school year. A lot of my clothes were repurposed from her old dresses. We always got 2 pair of shoes - one for school and one for church and had to change them to older tennies as soon as we got home. When I was in junior high I took home ec and started making my own clothes. When I started working I began to buy my own clothes from the cheapest department stores in whatever city we were living in.

When my father retired from the service we had a serious upgrade in our clothes. My mom got a job at the nicest clothing store in our smallish town and I suddenly had access to high-end clothes at a deep discount. They also had unlimited lay-away so I was able to pay things off as I had money available. My last 2 yrs of high school I had some of the nicest clothing in school. After a younger childhood of homemade and cheap clothes, it was a nice change. 

My DIL is a fashion designer, so when she came into our lives she would give me all kinds of very nice sample items for free. Through her I also gained an understanding of the extreme mark-up of retail clothing and accessories.

All of this set me up to appreciate the nicer things, but not want to pay very much for them. I still like to buy clothes, but they have to be on sale or from a thrift store. You can have nice things without spending a lot."

My mother always says things like ""oh, that just has a little gluten in it"". Like just a little won't affect me.

Lastly, in case you are not aware, an executor is usually entitled to take a fee for services in executing the will and distributing the estate. Most states and provinces list this amount as ""fair and reasonable"" but a usually accepted amount is between 1-5% of the total value of the estate.

Sorry, you don't know this about extra pantry stock. I think we should all stock up on staples if we can afford to. I know this post is about allowing yourself ""fun"" items, but being safe and being hungry are different things and ""fun"" is not in that equation. 

As far as your spending on the groceries in March, I would not have any remorse or concern about that. You will use that stuff up and I don't think it's bad to stockpile under the circumstances. I probably spent 2-3 times as much in mid-March than I normally buy and I haven't regretted it for a minute. Yes, my spending was through the roof for March, but I didn't have to go to the grocery store for nearly a month when our state first shut down. I've only made 1 trip since then for fresh foods. I am spending exactly ZERO on ""fun"" items. Maybe later, but now is not the time. On top of that, I got laid off unexpectedly. VERY unexpectedly, so I'm pretty darn glad I stocked up when I could.  

I had a milestone birthday right in the middle of this. My husband gave me a card he made, took me on a drive through the countryside and we got take-out dinner for the first time in 6 weeks. It was still a nice birthday without spending beyond the meal. 

We are in a global crisis right now. Frankly, with the current state of our world I still don't want to go to the grocery store as often as I used to. I'd say less than 50% of people were wearing masks when I did go, so it's not that safe a place to be. I am not going every week just because I used to. **Our supply chain is not as robust as we would like to think.** Stores are now rationing meat. Toilet paper is becoming currency. This could happen with lots of other items. My husband works in a manufacturing company that makes food processing equipment. They are losing work right and left. They are laying people off for the first time in 25 years. Food processing plants internationally are shutting down. Millions of people are unemployed and the lines for food banks are heartbreaking. 

If having ""fun"" things right now is that important, then limit yourself to one or two things but maybe think about what you already have that you can enjoy - bath products, books, movies, clothes in the back of your closet, games, crafts. Don't fall back into the shopping therapy trap for ""fun"" because that is not what any of us need right now."

AgingParents,fpkpebk,t3_gdys41,1588698733.0,"I will second that you are a good daughter, but you absolutely cannot risk getting what they have and bringing it home. Helping both sets of parents is commendable but your real responsibility is to yourself and your husband and your future. Adults their age should be able to take care of themselves and if they can't, then social services are available. If you live in the US, then they are also early Social Security age and should be collecting it. YOU should not be financially planning to take them into old(er) age. Seriously. YOU should be planning for your own future because that's what adult children do. I'm not saying you can't help them at all, but they are relatively young. Don't let them abdicate their responsibilities onto you. If you take it on, they will let you. 

When my mum-in-law (whom I loved) was in her early 50's she decided she should live with one of her adult children because she was an old lady and her children should take care of her. It then became the responsibility of the family to house her for the rest of her life. The other siblings all took turns. Every time one of them moved or decided it was OUR turn we said no (and of course had to face the anger). We still loved her, but that would have not been healthy for our young family or our marriage. To this day I do not regret making a decision that was best for us. 

I might call their doctor and talk to them about the skin condition. I know there is HIPAA and all that, but perhaps they can give you a medical power of attorney or at least give permission to discuss with you. Also, if you mention to the doctor that you have concerns about their mental state then they may be more willing to discuss with you. We had to do this with my FIL. We just called and shared our concerns about  hygiene and early onset dementia and that got the ball rolling."

declutter,fpib7vx,t3_gdl3y3,1588637347.0,"I feel your pain, totally! There IS a solution as I am slowly but surely  implementing it. My mother used me for years as the repository for the family heirlooms. I finally realized I was the avenue to assuage her own personal guilt for getting rid of things she didn't want. If she could pass them on to me then they stay in the family but NOT in her house. She would gift me things that were her grandmother's or her great aunt's or things she had made herself. Of course I would take and keep it all because...family heirloom. To be honest, I do cherish some of these things but not all of them. I have started to let go of the things I don't care for. I am now 60 and she is 82, so it's taken a long time but change is happening. 

I began this change in behavior by making comments like this: ""I'm decluttering today. I'm cleaning out a closet today. I have so much stuff, I really need to let go of some things."" AND ""Gee mom, I love a lot of what I have but please don't give me any more. I need to scale back. I need to declutter more. I have too much crap. I need to purge, clean out, let go."" I inserted these type of comments into our conversations often enough that it started to sink in. She stopped giving me so many things. She started asking me if I wanted something first and I would say ""NO thank you, offer it to someone else or get rid of it"". I'd turn it back on her and ask her ""Does that \_\_\_\_\_ really mean anything to you? If not let it go."" At first I think it was hard for her to hear that I din't want any more things from the family but now she gets it. She is wanting to downsize as she gets older, but I can't be her emotional storage unit anymore. If I decide to get rid of a family heirloom I will offer it back to her. If she doesn't want it, then it goes. A few things she has taken back but never used (like my grandmother's stand mixer).  

As far as the furniture - if it's broken or falling apart get rid of it!! I inherited one grandmother's bedroom set and some side tables from the other grandmother. My sons broke the bed by jumping on it and I kept it for years thinking I'd repair it. I didn't. The table fell apart and I never fixed that either. Broken furniture is junk. Even if it's old, it's still broken junk. You deserve to have furniture that YOU love. That YOU picked out. You deserve to find your own style without it having been forced upon you by someone else's castoffs. 

Re: the papers and such - I'd go through the papers, articles and what-have-you. Get a 3-ring binder with page protectors and keep only what will fit in one or two of them. Then file those binders in a bookcase. You don't have to keep old articles or recipes or cards unless they have meaning for you - REAL meaning not just the fact she sent it to you. I am working through old boxes of these types of items and YES, you can throw them away. Any recipe you need can readily be found on the internet. If you've read an article already (or even if you haven't) toss it.

The art will be the hardest part I think. Art is hardest to part with. I have paintings I've done but they are stacked in a corner. This year I am going to try rotating what I hang on my walls and display some of my own artwork instead of pictures other people have given me. You can try this with your own and your mother's. Hang it up for a couple months, then switch.

We've lived in our current home nearly 30 years. It was never our dream home, but it was adequate to raise our kids near a smallish town with good schools. We've sunk well over $100K in upgrades and remodeling over the years expecting to sell eventually. I always thought I wanted the magazine perfect house, big garage, master suite, etc. I  figured when we'd paid off this one we'd really start looking. However, now that our house is paid for we realize we have zero desire to take on additional debt. We have now decided to retire early and live comfortably in our 100 yr old house. It's plenty big enough for 2 empty nesters and a couple dogs for the foreseeable future. The kids rooms are now guest  room and office. We are actually super glad we never moved into the big dream house because we'd still be paying for it (and somebody has to clean it). 

We actually live in a fairly high cost of living area, so I'm sure we could get a good price for our home, but we'd still need to find another one. We are enjoying not having a mortgage or a HELOC right now. Once we didn't have a mortage payment our savings started to escalate with lightening speed.

LoriVallow,fpectyk,t3_gcue24,1588544984.0,"I'll just add my 2 cents. 

I have read articles that after being shot at, combined with Melani's involvement with Lori/Chad movement, her ex-husband Brandon Boudreaux became fearful for his life and the safety of his children. I believe that's when the custody battle began. I think he took the kids, filed for custody and she moved to Rexburg near Lori. Not sure of the timeline, but I'm sure someone could put it together based on articles and court records. There's a lot of salacious accusations in court filings between the two.  (Brandon's claims against Melani are very similar to what Charles had said in his divorce petition against Lori. A lot of kooky stuff related to the end times.)

I have read on other threads that Melani left a bunch of the children's  nice clothes and toys at the curb when she left. Possibly after Brandon had taken physical custody of the kids and before she moved to Rexburg? Done out of spite? Hard to say. 

There is a record of her trespassing on Brandon Boudreaux's parent's property - I believe twice. She may have been arrested? The assumption is she was trying to get/see the kids, but I've seen no report of her motives and Dateline did not ask her about this. 

To my understanding she has 4 children. It certainly smacks of following in Lori's footsteps that she is now a newly married woman with no children. Glad that her children (at least) are safe with her ex. 

I didn't necessarily think she looked scared on Dateline. I thought she came across as deceptive and definitely not telling all she knows. Her attempts at sincerity fell pretty flat. I did mostly believe Ian, but he's now stuck in a very murky quagmire. Poor chap."

I've been married a long time and we've accumulated a house full of stuff. I've told my husband many times to just donate all my stuff if I pass before him, and I'm completely serious. I have promised to do the same. Of course, there will be some treasured mementos but I don't want him constantly living with my stuff still surrounding him. I would want him to move on or at least not live in the past. Maybe think about what your wife would want you to do? 

When my father passed my mother got rid of his clothes right away and the rest of his possessions after about 6 months. She kept photographs but not much else. At first us kids thought she was moving too fast, but in hindsight it was the best thing she could do. Having all his stuff around just made her incredibly sad and lonely. 

I have also helped a friend of mine by removing all of his deceased wife's clothing, makeup and jewelry while he was out of the house. He couldn't face doing it and it wasn't that difficult for me. Sad, but not devastating as I knew I was doing it for him. All the clothing went to a women's shelter, so it was like she was paying it forward. Perhaps someone you trust could do the same for you?
