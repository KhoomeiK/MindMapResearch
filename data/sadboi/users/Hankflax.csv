Warthunder,fr1g8lv,t1_fr0uoc6,1589819189.0,War Thunder was never Just WW2. The literal description of the game is that you can fly planes from the 1930s all the way up to modern day.

cheatengine,fqy4ltb,t3_gljtbl,1589742496.0,"What antigopher said, if it’s a online game then the value is usually always stored on the server so yes unless you edit packets sent to the server, the value can’t be changed.

If it’s not online and the problem persists, try finding the static address of the value at hand and try to change that. If that doesn’t work, double check to make sure there is only one value that is holding the money. In some cases there are multiple values for one thing in the game that each store something different (I.e. inventory money, world money etc.) if none of that works then try making a AOB injection script to interrupt the function of money in the game so instead of losing money when you buy something you would gain, say, 1 million gold or whatever"
cheatengine,fqvwzhj,t3_gl8d1v,1589687102.0,If you search for Pokémon uranium cheat table on google and nothing comes up means there mostly likely isn’t one. Try making one it’s good fun and great practice!

cheatengine,fpxjnhj,t1_fpuwq9k,1588983859.0,"If you don’t want to mess with pointers you can write a simple script on the address that you found and the address with search for this value everytime the game is reset so you don’t need to find the static address. 

To do so, find your value like usual, right click it once you add it to the table and click find out what writes to this address and take a hit. When a address appears click it and click show in disassembler and press control A. Click template and click AOB injection and you’ll see some assembly code. Find out where the health value is being changed, I.e. (eax),edx - this means that the value at EDX is being added to EAX so for health EDX will probably be -1 or something and EAX is your health. Replace the EDX with, say, 1 or something and click save to cheat table in the top left and press the check mark on the table when you want to use it. Now when you get hit you’ll gain Health instead of losing it.

If you’re confused do the cheat engine tutorials, they touch on script injection."
AskReddit,fpw9ak9,t3_gfsi0q,1588959460.0,"Given this story isn’t mine but my 22 y/o (19 at the time) sister’s, we both had similar experiences but her’s was much worse. 

In our old house she was home alone while everybody else was out doing something, can’t remember. When we all come home she tells us this crazy story while she was in our attic watching TV when she hears this somewhat electronic ringing sound in the room that’s got steadly louder until it was ear piercing and she had to cover her ears. It was only in that room and everywhere else in the house was fine but that room. Eventually it went away but after hours and it slowly faded away too. My dad said she was probably doing drugs or was hallucinating (as he would normally say) so she never mentioned it again. I would a few months later have a similar experience but much shorter but equally as loud."

Paired with the survivability of the plane (for bomber) the cannons can prove effective on a not very smart fighter that isn’t avoiding the rounds

Warthunder,fpm6y4z,t3_ge6ohk,1588726815.0,It’s because it has 5 20mm Japanese cannons. It’s literally a flying tank. Given it’s still a bit to high br but the research cost is fair.

cheatengine,fped77g,t3_gcyecw,1588545200.0,So I don’t speak Italian and I’m working off of google translate but hopefully you can understand some English. It sounds like you want to change values on a online web browser card game. Usually with browser games and online games there’s a server side check that checks your client side values basically and if anything is off it sets it to what their supposed to be. That may be why you can’t.

CompetitiveForHonor,fp6k4f9,t3_gbgfpl,1588353711.0,The one problem is this isn’t a traditional fighting game. For honor has 3 directions that attacks could come from while say street fighter only has one direction and one button to block
Cringetopia,fp4wf93,t1_fp4nt48,1588309176.0,Fair point but he’s just using Germans and the Holocaust as an example to slavery and such that is mentioned in the post. Tbh I was thinking the exact same thing.
Games,fp4gr81,t1_fp2f0t3,1588298702.0,Couldn’t agree more. I’m quite an advocate for history and personally the journey of Alfred the Great is amazing. It would be saddening and even annoying if Ubi neglects all points of view and only approaches this game from one view as the ruthless invaders
cheatengine,fp4gfib,t3_gb3ptu,1588298500.0,"Personally haven’t tried anything with dark souls but as long as you do your cheating offline you’ll be okay cannot guarantee online plus it may not even be possible due to a decent amount of variables being client side.

eu4,fnsgd93,t3_g3nokp,1587221038.0,This happens a lot of the time when Ming explodes. Once Ming has lost most of their land Ming and all nations that discovered them get an event that a local commander for the Ming army gathered a bunch of Ming loyalists and high ranking officials and fled to Taiwan to regain their power and “retake” mainland Ming. Yet in all my games where I’ve seen this they never manage to get anymore power.

MB2Bannerlord,fm31xxb,t1_fm31sov,1585710813.0,"Exactly, I agree. Skyrim was their last game that actually felt like a proper AAA game. Fallout 4 had its greatnesses but fell short in a lot of places and I agree it’s about time they actually do something about their visuals. I’m not usually one to complain about graphics > gameplay but Bethesda has been using the same engine since day, 2008... i believe Star field is a whole new engine though."
