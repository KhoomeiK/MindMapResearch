limerence,f3xalaq,t3_dip3cj,1571234991.0,">  But for reasons I still don't quite get, after this both she and her  boyfriend totally cut me off. It's not like I made a move on my LO or  tried to break them up, so I'm not really sure what I did to deserve  this kind of treatment.  

I can understand the girl being upset... but the boyfriend too? It sounds like they were kinda investing time into a friendship with you so that they could participate in some more intimate stuff, honestly. You didn't deserve that kind of treatment, especially if you clearly explained that you'd developed feelings for this girl. No contact was the best if you were not trying to manipulate their relationship nor were you trying to take the girlfriend away. She sounds like she liked the attention from you.

As far as the molly, trauma, and limerance, I'm glad to see that things ended on a positive note. But so that this really doesn't blindside you again, I think you might need a few sessions of therapy. The drugs brought out a lot of repressed memories that you attached to someone who seemed like she was manipulating you after a while. I hope that you continue to be on this great path to peace, but to get ahead of the game, please consider speaking to a professional. You can't get in trouble about talking about past drug use with them, and they may be able to put whole experience (including the chemical reactions) that caused your limerance and repressed trauma to resurface in to perspective."

Now you can come off as a creeper if you've never even talked to this person or had little contact with them - that would scare anyone off. But I'm assuming you knew each enough.

We all here are worthy of love and companionship which makes it so damn frustrating and heartbreaking that it's almost never reciprocated. I hate watching people who are far from perfect and have their their own hangups like everyone else getting to be in relationships and getting the opportunity to grow with another person. It causes so much jealousy and heartache to have to constantly go through life's journey alone because we are told we just have to love ourselves and find ourselves first before seeking a partner. But others are allowed to have successful relationships when both parties are broken and they get to work together. I don't know...  I don't want to be jealous, but the Universe has got to know that it hurts. Fuck the saying that life's not fair. I'm over it and get it and it sucks."

Advice,f1ymjus,t1_f1yl4tr,1569819607.0,"Thank you. It means a lot to hear from someone whose been in a similar situation. I wish I could pick up and leave to another state, but I financially can't. He unfortunately lives in the house helped him get 5 minutes from where I am now. I'd love to leave but I feel like my problems will just follow me. People suck lol. I'm happy for you and your husband though :). I'm just not sure I can take another heartbreak"

autism,f1csi92,t1_f1co7a6,1569364765.0,"Thank you. I have begun to remove him from my life, but unfortunately there are some financial things I have to solidify with him as we shared some accounts. I've blocked his number and asked him to just email me but he is now holding out saying he needs to ""think about things"" before he can make a decision to pay me back for bills. I just want this to over with and I truly do hope he gets help. I've 80% forgiven him already as I think he's been hurting for a long time and his mask finally fell for everyone in his life. Hurt people hurt people. I will also check out the book you were talking about and hopefully find those meditation pages so I don't have to buy it, lol."
