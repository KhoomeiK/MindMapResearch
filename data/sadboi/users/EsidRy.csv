mentalhealth,filtvt3,t3_f89un5,1582510222.0,"Yes, all the time. And I still do. 

The times I received criticism definitely greatly outnumber the times I received compassion and support. I grew up in a dominantly Asian-American community in Honolulu, HI, and most people have no idea that mental illness has any medical origins. They largely see it as mental weakness, attention-seeking, craziness, etc. I know very well that not much can be done to stop them or reduce them. For me, moving to a different place helped a lot.  


Wishing the best for you!"
