That would seem like the state you live in facilitated and aided you in achieving your goal of getting insurance coverage, through the vessel of a federally enacted law. The federal government may have laid the groundwork, but the tangible change in your life was facilitated and enacted by the state government."

When you lose the popular vote with a poor voter turnout (meaning more liberal leaning college kids and young adults who weren’t compelled to go vote), it’s pretty obvious that anything he does is going to be majority disapproved."
politics,fe2f9un,t1_fe2ctah,1578837738.0,"While I’m sure I agree with you wholeheartedly in an ideological sense, when has anything done on a federal government level improved your life? You improve your own life through volition and self-motivation and if there’s any governmental policy that helps you out or improves your life, it likely came from the state or local level.

This is a bit of an asinine question to ask when there are so many other things you could say in regards to our unduly elected president and his nepotistic operation of our country."

I know this was written by Bernie’s campaign manager, but it alludes to things in public record (legislature, votes, newspaper columns, etc.) where Joe Biden not only helped create the framework that has disenfranchised minority (especially black) communities, but also supported (as recently as right before he was chosen to be VP) legislature that keeps them as the “lesser” class.

How you can make a wide sweeping generalization, without citing a single source, that Biden has a long history of working with the African-American community seems, a bit off base, to be honest with you."
