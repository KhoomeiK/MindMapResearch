Jesus was a prick, and Mother Teresa was a sadistic freak.

Religion is a con man’s way of convincing you you’re sick, and then selling you the cure. 

There is animosity and pain in this world, and it ain’t going anywhere anytime soon. 

Things you don’t have correct:

Despite what you see on the news and how heart wrenching it is, this is actually the most peaceful time in history. 

Of course there are good people. People on this subreddit, for example. The fact that this subreddit even exists. Do you really believe that even children are evil? Do you think my niece and nephew should off themselves?

Are you evil? I don’t think so. But I don’t know you. It’s called benefit of the doubt. Most people are mostly good most of the time. 

But I wouldn’t say it’s a vast majority.

Hopefully one day, everyone of all genders will be seen as valuable members of society with their own self worth. I’ve learned from this thread to not let the loud-crowd skew your views on something that is positive and ought to be celebrated (feminism, and women in general). 

Hopefully one day, those misogynistic men will be a relic of our past, something we look back on and shake our heads at. 

And hopefully one day, the women who have been abused/been hurt will find a way to heal, and understand that there have always been men that want them to have the same privileges and rights as they do.

I’ve only called those ignorant who make comments that group everyone with this condition into the same category as being just bad and terrible people. Surely you’ve read those comments too. I’m assuming so since you’re replying based on that context. 

Some of the things that have been said here today are borderline hate speech towards anyone with either BPD or any mental ailment. I’m absolutely floored that I would get such hostile and vitriolic response from this community. One based around a company that promotes respect, equality, and advocacy. So far all I have experienced here is hate and ignorance. 

You’re acting like petty people online don’t exist. Those that report you over nothing. If I had done something, at least something I could put my finger on, I wouldn’t come out here like this. I’d slink away into the shadows like a loser who knows they’ve fucked up."
