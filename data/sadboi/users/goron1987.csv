Xiaomi,fm4ggxe,t3_fsz8rr,1585753663.0,"I have a Mi A2 since December 2018 and never had any issues. It only froze two times and even survived a fit of rage where I threw the phone on the floor. Only the screen protector shattered. I will try to sum my opinion about it in pros and cons:  
Pros:  
\- Storage  
\- CPU  
\- RAM  
\- Design  
Cons:  
\- Speakers  
\- No P2 input  
\- Front camera

I never installed custom ROMs and recently updated to Android 10. Everything is still running smoothly. Battery life is ok. It can last the whole day if you don't use it for gaming, streaming or any other function that requires too much processing, and it can get a bit hot but nothing out of the ordinary for mid-range phones. However, you can charge it pretty quickly thanks to the USB-C port. Definitely recommend this model."

A gerente perguntou coisas normais como formação, experiência na área etc. Enquanto eu respondia, o dono me interrompeu e perguntou ""qual é o seu signo?"", eu fiquei sem ação, fiz uma pausa e respondi ""Touro"", ele apenas falou ""Ah tá"". Depois, em outro momento, ele interrompeu de novo e perguntou ""Qual é a sua cor favorita?"". Aí eu já tava pensando ""Que porra é essa??"" e falei ""Então, eu sou daltônico e não sou bom com cores, mas eu gosto do que vejo na cor azul"". Ele olhou pra minha cara por um tempo e depois falou ""Ok"".  
No dia seguinte, me ligaram falando que eu tinha sido contratado. Trabalhei lá por um ano e outros funcionários me contaram outras maluquices do dono como, por exemplo, realocar um pessoal porque ""tinha muito leonino na mesma sala""."

Bass,fg03d2u,t3_evw57m,1580399316.0,"I got a guitar when I was a teenager but I never played it well because I was too lazy to practice, so I stick with singing, did some singing lessons and practiced guitar whenever I felt like.

So, now, around 15 years later, I have a band where I sing and used to play rhythm guitar. Bassists are a troublesome lot. We had five different bassists in less than six months. At the same time, I had borrowed my brother-in-law old bass, and was toying around with it.

I had never played bass before, and, considering how difficult was to find a bassist around, I told my band mates that I would try to play bass and sing. Then, I started seriously practicing by playing bass everyday, watching bass videos and learning the basics with Yousician. After four months, I was able to play a simple walking bass line while singing, and I was able to play Psycho Killer bass line while singing. My band mates approved and then I became a singer/bassist.

However, I didn't think I would like bass so much. I enjoy it much more than guitar. I still play everyday and I'm always trying to improve. A couple of months ago, a friend of mine started a band and asked me to become their bassist and I promptly accepted it.

As for my brother-in-law old bass, I ended up buying it. Took it to a luthier and now its brand new. I also bought another bass sometime later from a guitarist in mint condition. He had bought new for his brother, as he seemed interested in playing but he told me his brother actually played it two times and never touched the bass again. He was asking a very good price for it and it was almost brand new, so I took it. It's been 7 months since I've playing bass and I regret not trying it sooner."

NintendoSwitch,ffdwm7z,t3_esyqdq,1579830743.0,"Damn.  
The Nintendo certified Brazilian tech support also sucks. I left my joycons there to fix the drift issue and the initial deadline they gave was 15 days. Then, 15 days later they postponed to 30, and then more 15 days because they were waiting for the parts to come from Japan. I got tired of their shit and asked for my joycons back to take to another tech support but they gave me someone else's joycon instead. That really pissed me off and after many complaints, they told me to bring my joycons that they would fix it in the same day. The parts magically appeared there after I complained a lot."

EDIT: I couldn't go... I called my mom in the last minute saying I couldn't go there and pretend that everything was fine to a bunch of people who doesn't even care that I exist. This old friend of theirs and his family are my folks people, not mine. We don't have anything in common and I would only feel more lonely there. My mother understood but my parents became very worried. I hadn't opened up about my depression to them until that point. They told me we should talk sometime soon.  
However, not all was bad. After I calmed down, my fiancée told her family would spend Christmas together. Since her mother died some years ago, her brother and father were never around for Christmas. So it was nice that this year her family was going to get together for Xmas after so many time.

I feel way more comfortable around them. I ended up bringing my PS4, we played, had some beers, talked. It was nice. I felt normal again and I think they enjoyed it too. 2019 was a shit year for my fiancée's brother and his wife too."

However, I ended picking up the game in PS4 because it was cheaper (Nintendo games are luxury articles here in Brazil) and because I didn't liked the Nintendo Switch port, which is a shame. I played the demo version and I found it a bit choppy specially underwater. The FPS drops are noticeable and really bothered me."
