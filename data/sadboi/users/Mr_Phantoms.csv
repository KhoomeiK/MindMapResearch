You say you're addicted to porn, you should seek therapy and try and fix that beforehand. Though you might think being in a relationship will fix your porn addiction, it doesn't work like that. There are many cases of guys in relationships who are addicted to porn. If your addiction is due to having too much time, try and use that time in a more productive way. Also don't try and quit cold turkey, you'll most likely relapse."

The best thing you can do is have a serious conversation with him, don't hold anything back. Sex is important in a relationship, especially at your age when libido levels tend to be through the roof. Tell him you love him but sex is something important for you and if you guys are that sexually incompatible, maybe it's best to end the relationship.

relationship_advice,fm6mrsw,t3_ftew1o,1585797726.0,"I think you just answered your question, but first off think about yourself. Are you in a good place to be in a relationship? A lot of people go into relationships having issues and think that by going into one will rid you of all your problems, it doesn't work like that. Only you can know if you should date someone. Are you ready to be in one? 

Now to answer you question, if you know she isn't good for you, why would you want to be with her? If you like the other girl, give it a shot. But before you do, answer truthfully if you're in a place where you can be in a relationship. If not, what do you need to work on? What do you need to change?"

By the looks of things this is a short fling and you're her second choice until she finds someone better. She doesn't want to be alone so she wants you to keep her company until she leaves in October. She says she wants to be single when she travels because she wants to hook up with other people whilst traveling (totally fine). You shouldn't try and change her as she obviously had planned this before hand.

If I were in your shoes I would break up now, unless you're also looking for a short term fling, otherwise you'll end up in a complete mess come October. Tell her you appreciate the past 5 months, but you're looking for someone who wants a long term relationship. You guys can keep in touch during that time if you want (though I don't suggest doing so) but you want to end the relationship now before you start developing more feelings. You said you guys haven't said ""love you"" to each other so you aren't in too deep, which is why if you want to leave, do it now."

mentalhealth,ff1ltkj,t3_er14hs,1579481292.0,"I feel like it's a lot of different things put together in one basket. A few of them are: *The rise of internet and tech* (we now receive instant information on any particular thing in a matter of seconds, so we consider it is going to be like that in every aspect of our lives, i.e. success, meaningful relationships). *The fact we were told by people we were special* (this creates a chip on our brain that says everything will always be sunshines and rainbows and nothing hard or bad will ever occur to us). *The fact that our parents were either overprotective or non existent* (we don't have someone to guide us through our hardships and give a shoulder to cry on when we need it). These are just a few of many reasons why our generation (I'm 21) is so depressed.

The worst part is I believe generations younger than us will have it far worse. I truly believe that social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok (which I think is the most popular among teens nowadays) are the main reason why we've become so depressed. People either bully you or showcase a perfect life that doesn't exist outside your screen, both of which affect you mentally. I also believe people lack motivation to do things now more than during our parents time. The fact that we have instant information on everything you could possibly imagine has led our minds to believe we can have anything we want instantly without having to work hard for it. This together with the fact we've grown to be softer than our past generations break us completely. Some people can get over it, some can't.

Another reason why I think more people are depressed now than before is because our parents would tell us to just get over it, or that it was fase on our teenage years, that it would be fine. This has led is to grow weaker not only as people but as a society as well. So when the going got tough, we didn't know what to do and broke down. The ten of millions of people who lack motivation (through no fault of their own) to do anything is a result of this. And like I said before, I think it'll only get worse. 

It's true that some people reach out and get help, but the truth is far more people go unnoticed and untreated than the ones who actually do."
offmychest,fbdfb8w,t3_eckucr,1576760334.0,"Instead of being onesided like other people, I'd suggest you get well informed on both parties and its candidates and then make a decision. Don't vote for a candidate or party just because your friend or family is also voting for him, get informed on  who they are, what they promise to do, and what their agenda is (sometimes they hide what their real goals are). Try and get multiple sources of information to make it more unbaised (ie. if you search for Republicans and only read Fox or search for Democrats and only read CNN, all you'll find is the network bashing the other party.) This is why I like AP news and Reuters, as they are the most unbaised news (in my opinion). I would also suggest looking up Tim Pool on youtube. He's more left leaning but always gives an unbaised view of the news. He's also the first left leaning person I know who will call out and critize the Democrats when they are doing bad things.

You could also vote for an independent party but seeing how bipartisan the US is, voting Rep of Dem will be a more defining vote. Instead of bashing the opposing party like u/forrest38 did, I won't mention what my views are as they shouldn't affect your election. It is important that you choose a candidate who reflects on your beliefs and not get sucked into a party because of other people.  

I would ask however, that you be respectful about other peoples opinion even if they don't allign with your beliefs. One of the most beautiful things you have being an American is the right to free speech, meaning you can say whatever you want to. That being said, you should still be respectful towards others and not insult them for having different views as others.

I would say I daydream around 3/4 hours a day, which is really bad since it means I end up procrastinating everything I need to do. Most of the time it's whenever I'm doing something else like listening to music or watching a movie. I will stop doing whatever it is that I'm doing, close my eyes, and start daydreaming. Like you mentioned, I feel like it's a coping mechanism. I don't have anyone in my life to talk to (no friends, and family that I barely know) so daydreaming lets me feel like I have people in my life. 

On the one hand, I feel like I need to get some help because daydreaming prevents me from actually living, but I have major trust issues so going to a psychiatrist is a no no for me. One the other hand, I don't really want to get help. My daydreaming life is so fun and exciting and I actually have people I love and trust.

dating_advice,f2e4sm3,t3_dd420o,1570180761.0,"I understand both sides. You want to be in an exclusive relationshipo, whilst she might've wanted to be in an open relationship. However, both positions are valid. If you're dating someone and haven't had the ""we're exclusive"" talk, you should take into account that they might be seeing other people. There's nothing wrong with that and you should respect her decision as you two aren't technically  an exclusive couple. 

Having said that, I also understand and agree with you point of view. If I started dating a girl and we haven't yet had the ""exclusive"" talk yet I would hope she didn't date others as I wouldn't go out with other women, but wouldn't get mad at her if she did as we're technically not exclusive. It would hurt as I would only be seeing her whilst she see's others, but I wouldn't hold it against her. If I want to be in a commited relationship, I'd have the ""exclusive"" talk sooner.

On a side note, you said it was the first date. You shouldn't be surprised/mad that she's seeing other people as this is your first time going out with her. I'd only see it as a problem if she did it 3 months in the relationship, by which time you should've already had the ""exclusive"" talk with her.

Also, couldn't she/he see that you and your friend were laughing? I could understand if she saw you telling racist jokes to someone who looks angry or sad, but c'mon. 

I also find it very intresting how there are doubles standards in racism. If you tell a joke about someone who isn't white, you're racist. However, if you tell a racist joke about a white person, it's completely fine. I also find it very intresting how the category white/caucasian bundles up a bunch of different races who have ""fair skin"" but are completely different races. Middle-eastern races fall into the category of white if their skin is light enough. Apparently all ""latinos"" are similar to brown mexicans though if you actually went to South America you'd see the millions of people who are ""white"".

I think you're really overwhelmed with school and all your activities and maybe are having an existential crisis as well. I'd suggest if you can to take 2 or 3 days to relax completely and not think about school. It'll clear your mind.

I didn't get the feeling of vomiting but I started sweating profusely to the point that my shirt was completely drenched and my hands and feet started trembling. It didn't help that someone in the back of the room started laughing and making remarks on how I was sweating so much. 

The best thing you can do when you're having a panic attack (even though it's extremely difficult to do) is to think about other things. I once read that if you, or someone else, is having a panic attack, the best thing you can do is get him talking with an easy exercise. Ask him what are:
5 things he/she can see,
5 things he/she can touch,
5 things he/she can smell, 
5 things he/she can hear,
And 5 things he/she can taste.
If he/she can't think of anything from the top of his/her head ask about things around her (ie. Clothes, backpacks, books, etc.)

The worst thing you can do when having a panic attack is think about it, it just gets worse. You did something great by telling some about it, you're on your way to getting proper health.
Wish you the best of luck.

mentalhealth,ewlhgvp,t3_coe9mh,1565524422.0,"I'm in a similar situation. 20M who goes to university. Last year was my worst year by far. This year started horrible but is slowly getting better. Last year all I would do is go to uni and come back home to my bedroom. I wouldn't go out at all and would spend 2/3 of my day laid in bed watching youtube videos. This year I started having panic attacks in public, specifically in the library at my university, whereas before I would only get them at home. My depression and anxiety has lowered a bit in the last few months and the last panic attack I had was about 3 months ago. I'm still a little scared to go to the library for fear of having another panic attack.

I can't help you with your medication as I don't take any or with your therapist as I don't go to one (I have really bad trust issues so talking to someone about my problems is a big no no). But there were 2 things that helped me and still help me on my day to day. The first one is music: I listen to a lot of music and this has helped me a lot. There are 2 youtube channels where I regularly listen to music, MrSuicideSheep and TheBootlegBoy. And the artists I listen to the most on spotify are Eden, Kina and Blackbear. I've come to the realization that I spend about 4/5 hours a day listening to music and this has helped me a lot. The other thing that has helped me is going to Starbucks 2/3 times a week. This has helped me because it gets me to live my house even if it's for an hour. I also take a book and try to read one chapter whilst drinking coffee. I'm also trying to be friendlier to the people I have class with and have small talk with. This is by far the hardest thing but trying to get out of my comfort zone has helped lowering my anxiety.

Hopefully one of these things can help you out. I know how hard it is to lack motivation and not be able to do anything because of your depression and anxiety. But just know that you're not alone amd it will get better. If you need someone to talk to you can always send me a message :)"

*Are you a shit person for accepting the handjob?* Absolutety. I doubt the masseuse had a gun to your head and told you if you didn't get a handjob you would die, you could've just said no.

*Should you tell your wife?* Yes. Most comments say you should keep quiet and not do it again but if you're a real man you'll admit your wrong doing and pray she'll forgive you.

*Should your wife divorce you?* I don't know. To me loyalty is the most important thing in life so if my wife ever gave another man a blowjob or handjob I would divorce her. Not because of the act but because I would never be able to trust her again and without trust relationships don't work.

*Do I think you and your wife have marital problems?* Yes. If the relationship between you and your wife was at its best I doubt you would've wanted to get a handjob.

Hopefully they will tell him to not go. All I did was give him two possibilities of his ""friends"" request to go to the beach, his ""friend"" could either be a nice guy that just wants to hang out (I doubt this is the case) or could be a peodophile that wants to lure a 16 year old kid away from his city to assault or kidnap him (I feel like this is most likely). I also stated how he shouldn't go as I, just like every other redditor who commented, thought the 25 year old guy had no business hanging out with a 16 year old kid, let alone go with him to another city. I said what you quoted because even after reading all our comments and negleting his brothers advice to hang out with a guy much older than him, he might still decide to go with him, in that case he should at the very least give his parents all the details of his so called ""friend""."

relationship_advice,evlcj8s,t3_ckaovj,1564593033.0,"This may be an unpopular idea but why don't *you* propose to him? I know it's tradition for a guy to propose to a woman, but we're in the 21st century, a woman can also propose to a guy. 

Also, you said you didn't want to rush anything, but have already started to drop hints on what you want? And like u/enjoyoutdoors said, *""Oh, I was planning to..* says nothing about how far he has planned or if he even started planning at all. 

One last point I'd like to make (and please take this with a grain of salt as I know nothing about your relationship with your partner) is that getting married is nothing more than signing a few papers that says you guys are a union between the two of you and have established rights and obligations. Being married doesn't equate to him loving you more or less or you loving him more less, it's just a legal binding between two people. You also stated that you didn't want to rush marriage as you guys have kids and to that I'd like to say that nothing should change when you guys get married. You guys should still love each other and care for each other as if you just started dating, that's how healthy marriages last. 

Whatever you guys do, get married or wait longer, I wish nothing but the best for you guys. Hope you guys have a loving, caring and lasting relationship and family."
relationship_advice,evl8ro4,t3_ckapr0,1564591720.0,"I don't think so.

It's perfectly normal for you to sometimes have some sort of friendship will your ex. Millions of people remain friends with their exes long after their intimate relationship ended. Some people are worth staying in contact with even after after ending the relationship. I feel like it depends on why you ended the relationship. If either person was unfaithful to the other, I don't see why you should keep in contact. But if you guys were friends before, dated, and then realized you were better staying as friends again, I don't see why it should be a problem. It also depends on how you guys kept in contact after ending the relation. If your ex out of nowhere started talking to you, asking you how you were doing, etc, it may indicate that he still has some sort of crush/affection towards you.

At the end you ask if your boyfriend should feel jealous. You're the only one who can answer. Are you giving him a reason for him to be? Did he know prior to you guys dating that you kept in contact with your ex or did he find out out of nowhere? I feel like this is the type of situation you should address to your partner, because if you don't and he finds out by himself, he might be mistrustful of you. If he is jealous of you texting your ex, this might show how you guys aren't as open and trusting to each other as you may think. If I truly trusted my partner I wouldn't think of anything if she talked to her ex. I would like a heads up that she is still in contact with him, but I wouldn't really care. If you guys aren't trusting each other enough, it would be great if you guys talked about it as this could lead to bigger problems in the future."
SeriousConversation,evl3v0a,t3_ck8vmj,1564590033.0,"I would be very uncomfortable if a 25 year old guy went to another city with a 16 year old if they are not related, but at the end of the day, you're the one who decides if you'll go with him or not, no one else will. 

One the one hand,without taking into account his age, it seems that he could really be your friend. Maybe he genuinely is a nice guy that just wants to hang out with one of his friends. But on the other hand, this is very fishy. 25 year olds shouldn't be hanging out with 16 year olds. You might think that since you are a guy he won't hurt you, but boys are taken advantage just as much as girls. It also seems weird that after 3 months without any contact he asks you out of nowhere to go to the beach with him, in another city. Your brother is right by telling you to not hang out with people older than you. When I was your age I also thought nobody could ever hurt me, but now I noticed how stupid and naive I was. You also said he hangs out with kids younger than 16, what type of 25 year old guy hangs out with kids under the age of 16 and doesn't have some sort of malicious intent. It's also weird that only you two will go on the trip. I'd like to know what car he drives that only has two seats. The only cars I know that only have two seats are expensive sports cars. Some may have two doors but will more than likely have backseats. By the way you wrote this post, I think your ""friend"" is some sort of predator. Typical predator behaviour consists of people much older than you making you think they are your friend, making you feel confortable around them. They will do you favours and ask nothing in return. They will make you think they genuinely are your friends and wait. Wait until they have the opportunity to take advantage of you.

I want to reiterate what I said at the beggining, you're the one who will choose whether you go or not. But you asked us on reddit if you should or not, and my answer is for you **not to go**. I may be completely wrong and he might be the nicest, most innocent person on earth, but history has taught us that older guys who hang out with kids much, much younger than them often are some sort of predator, and I would much rather you hurt his feelings by declining to go, than to read on the news that a 16 year old boy was found dead near the beach after being assaulted. I'm sorry if I hurt your and your friends feelings by stating that you shouldn't go but that's my opinion.

*P.S.* Some questions you should ask him and yourself: why did he ask **you** to go with him instead of your other friend or  someone the same age as him? Would he decline if your older brother or another grown person accompanied you guys? Also, Why did he suggest to go to the beach? Have you told him that you wanted to go to the beach? 

*P.P.S.* If you do end up going with him, make sure your parents and brother know exactly who this guy is, what his full name is, what kind of car he drives and the license plate number. Also if you know where he lives write down the address. Make sure you give them all this information before you go, that way if something were to happen to you, they would know who the culprit was.

*P.P.P.S.* If you went with him to the beach after giving your parents all his information and he asked you if you told anyone where you guys were going, take this as a red flag. He may be asking because if people don't know where you're going and with who you're going with, he could get away with hurting you."
SeriousConversation,evg9shk,t1_evem4o7,1564507655.0,"Well the need to reproduce is imbedded in our DNA, so it's only natural you have those desires. That's the sole purpose of being ""horny"". Why do you feel disgusted at yourself? Is it because your religion/beliefs see it as something wrong? Is it because you had a bad experience with it so everything related to sex disgusts you? Is it simply because you don't like being sexual? There are no right or wrong answers, these questions are only here to make you think *why*. What is very wrong, in my opinion, is that you're considering harming yourself because feeling or being sexual disgusts you.
