On the bike ride to the trip spot I kept vividly imagining horrible shit happening like my sister flipping out on someone and them calling police and her getting shot or something. Ended up leaving the trip site early because she kept saying stuff that was making me anxious and started thinking unflattering thoughts about her which made me feel bad for judging her. As soon as I got back in my room felt the warmest sense of safety return to me."
