nonprofit,fpxnvj5,t3_gg3lz2,1588986092.0,"Fiscal sponsorships are a great way to do good work in a community, get some experience, and avoid some of the hassles of being a fully functioning 501(c)3 - but only some. My community foundation does more of this than DAFs. We say we are a conduit of funds, not a container of funds. /grin/ Here's how it works with us, but it's very different depending on the sponsoring org.  \[sorry for the length here\]

Basically, a 501(c)3 org serves as the 501(c)3 umbrella for a charitable *project*. Yes, in my fiscal sponsorship world, we don't refer to our sponsored ""organizations"" - they are sponsored projects of our foundation.

You apply - it's usually extensive. To be a project of my foundation, it has to receive Board approval. We do this on a rolling basis. One of the commenters here is sort of right -- because your sponsoring 501(c)3 is taking responsibility for your work, your finances, and grants,  we have criteria - there's has to be some sort of structure. Because there is money involved, you can't just be 1 person - there has to be at least a couple of other people, e.g. ""Board of Directors"" who can authorize things that you buy (because obviously you can't authorize your own purchase, right?) So, just because of checks and balances, you have to have a ""Board of Directors."" We have worked with many 1-person projects. 1 person applied for grants, did all the implementation, assessments, reporting, everything - she just didn't authorize check requests. They stayed with us for 10 years and then became a 501(c)3 when they felt ready. We wouldn't let them fail!

For every donation, we process the tax receipt and thank you on behalf of our sponsored project. But the project director also says thanks, of course. Project directors identify and write up grants - we are the ones who upload those grants into the portal - we are the sponsoring org, so we are the grantee and the funds are designated to our sponsored project. We oversee the budgets and make sure that reporting is done on time and is of quality. Have to, right? Because ultimately WE are the grantee. But we also really want these projects to succeed! So of course, we work with them on all sorts of things, too, like how to get the word out (we share their work through social media), how to do data collection for reports, tell stories for marketing, and we help them to network with more nonprofits.. and we even advocate for and direct donors to them. 

We do charge a fee - on average it's 7.5%. But it's very flexible- anywhere from 0% - 10% of funds deposited. How do we decide? The project itself and the amount of money and the level of work it will require our finance department. Look, when two category five hurricanes hit and our government was on the ground, you're damn straight we waived fiscal sponsorship fees for grassroots volunteer groups providing relief! But yes, our accounting department processes all checks. It makes us more than grantmakers - make sure to view your fiscal sponsor as a financial institution, an incubator. You will have to submit check requests to them to drawdown funds --- but for us, we believe in flexible funding (remember, conduit, not container). So it usually only takes us about 5 days to process a check, including reconciling requests with the budget, printing, going through our compliance officer, etc.  We have done many at 0%. We have served over 250 grassroots and full nonprofits - right now we serve 40 at the same time.

Lots of community foundations don't like to do fiscal sponsorships. It requires a lot of hand-holding, but that's the point of philanthropy, right? To help others who want to learn or just might not have the organizational capacity to manage a grant - that should stop the work? Sometimes it does - we file all the taxes and manage everything. You can't get a CPA for what our fee is. But to be fair, sure fiscal sponsorship is hard work but if you are sort of 'pure, conventional"" grantmaker,  DAFs aren't easy if you are doing grantmaking right. And direct services, boots on the ground - that's hard work we respect.

There a lot of service providers who are 501(c)3s who will also be a sponsoring org- but if it's not something they typically do, then you need a very close relationship with them. As for my community foundation, we look at ourselves as incubators, promoters of philanthropic work. But the BIG reason I think more foundations and organizations don't do this is because... it's *competition*. Donors may have the conception that they are giving to my foundation - when really, they are giving to the project. So when I reach out for funds, they are confused. Didn't I already give you money? Well, yes, but it's not ours, it's not a grant fund, we share the control with the project director. And there have been several times my foundation stepped down from a grant opportunity for one of our smaller nonprofits, so they could go after the grant. We are 30 years old and unendowed, but this is what we do, because we cannot imagine sitting on a giant corpus in the middle of a pandemic or a hurricane or anything. 

Fiscal sponsorship is a GREAT IDEA! We always recommend people interested in starting a 501(c)3 give serious consideration to this.! Instead of a 501(c)3, shift the paradigm. JOIN with an existing nonprofit; leverage your core competencies and *work together*.  You'll have to do the work, build the structure - you are accountable. But you can learn and grow. You have a really good idea that I wish more explored. 

Sorry to go on and on. Fiscal sponsorship means organizations get to know their community. It makes our grantmaking 10 times more powerful because we really KNOW our nonprofits. Not saying others don't and there's a space for all kinds of nonprofits. But fiscal sponsorship is unique. Interview the foundation as much as they interview you! Good luck!"

Ultimately, in terms of legality, any org. can build policies and procedures to get around legal issues that stand in the way of what they want to accomplish. But, wow -- the *ethical* implications of bonuses for *charitable* gifts is murky at best. Are donors aware of their ""bonus"" policy? That's, I guess, the real question. If they do not know, why not? My father once told me: if you don't want this as a headline in the newspapers, then it's probably not okay. Is your org okay with having a headline, ""Local Nonprofit gives 10% of Charitable Gift to CEOs as Bonuses!""

DAFs are traditionally very murky.  The Foundation I work for has deliberately chosen to not focus on fund development. We are admittedly in a small community, but donors can easily compromise a charitable organization by simply saying, ""If you don't' fund this we won't give you any money.""
