corsets,fqb2bkp,t1_fqalh8b,1589229345.0,So glad that your corset came in and it fits well! I got a response this morning and mine has also shipped today so hopefully I‚Äôll be joining the club soon. Thanks for your response!
corsets,fq8chf7,t1_fq899xq,1589163085.0,"Thanks for your response. 

Yeah I‚Äôm wayyy outside of the 2-3 day processing time window at this point. I‚Äôm going to try to be patient because her corsets have a great reputation but it‚Äôs a little frustrating to be 3 weeks out and still not receive an email with an update. At least now I know what to expect in the future."
bipolar,fp2fxoz,t3_gapxp5,1588261081.0,"Abilify has given me some weird and definitely counterproductive side effects. Increased recklessness/impulsiveness, eyelid/muscle spasms, increased insomnia, etc. and I still hit a month-long depressive episode while on 2mg. I‚Äôm getting off of it in about a week."
painting,fp0irl7,t3_gaindf,1588210096.0,Beautiful!
bipolar,fosbgb7,t1_for1kq3,1588027459.0,"Aww, thanks :‚Äô)"

bipolar,foons6r,t1_foofu0g,1587942702.0,Thank you :)
bipolar,foo0d3v,t3_g8d13x,1587930021.0,"I think it was triggered at a very young age, around maybe 9, perhaps the trifecta of being abused, my parents divorcing, and a prominent figure in my family dying all in quick succession."
bipolar,fnu7qcl,t3_g3u831,1587256271.0,This is so unbelievably cute!
bipolar,fn78bpy,t1_fn63x46,1586715259.0,I love that short story. Thank you so much.
bipolar,fn4qinl,t3_fzh3if,1586646803.0,I LOVE this. Well done.
bipolar,fn1r3ri,t3_fymwp7,1586568158.0,This is amazing!
sewing,fmcx65u,t1_fmcqt6o,1585954634.0,"Ugh. I knew there had to be a catch, thanks for the heads up."
sewing,fmc66pb,t3_fudzas,1585939646.0,A dream for a beginner (like me) in quarantine!
bipolar,flfjmkk,t1_flemvx3,1585108310.0,"That‚Äôs okay - congrats on the stability though, that‚Äôs something I know we all strive for :)"
bipolar,flevsaq,t3_focedl,1585092525.0,I love this!
bipolar,flem5bf,t1_flel6na,1585087028.0,"Thank you! I am newly diagnosed (but was in and out of treatment as a teen, had several depressive & manic episodes) so I‚Äôm honestly nervous. I don‚Äôt want to have to go through this again with another med. I can‚Äôt imagine being on vraylar for a year! Did you have any side effects while taking it?"
bipolar,fleih1v,t3_fned2q,1585085023.0,"Vraylar was making my life hell (dizzy, disoriented, muscles stiff as fuck, paranoia, manic) so against all advice, I stopped cold turkey three days ago. First day or two was fine. Yesterday and today have been hell, with the symptoms I was trying to get away from coming back (withdrawal maybe?) and now I‚Äôm just waiting patiently for my follow up appointment on Tuesday so we can start this rollercoaster all over again with another new med üòÖ"
sewing,fkzgr53,t1_fkz4tql,1584670614.0,It‚Äôs so dense with detail and information too. I‚Äôm glad this is the first one I‚Äôve purchased because I may not need to buy any others after all :)
sewing,fkzgou0,t1_fkz4rai,1584670571.0,That‚Äôs a great sign. Thank you!
sewing,fkzgnta,t1_fkz16gu,1584670553.0,"I bought it, ~$6.39 on thriftbooks.com."
sewing,fkz0foj,t1_fkz0ccr,1584660039.0,Please get it. It‚Äôs worth every last cent. Sooo. much. info.
sewing,fkyzxln,t1_fkywhu9,1584659730.0,I highly recommend it!
sewing,fkyzndt,t3_flj9q5,1584659557.0,"I got this on thriftbooks.com for like $6.39, btw!"
sewing,fkyzm0e,t1_fkyy0gf,1584659533.0,"I was BLOWN AWAY at the level of detail. It helps soooo much because YT tutorials kinda skim through some very basic info that I just don‚Äôt know yet. So when I go to do my own projects, it‚Äôs just... a mess haha."
bipolar,fkfudjb,t3_fi3uqz,1584142754.0,"This is amazing!

And also looks like it would be sold at Dolls Kill (still a good thing). lol."
creepyencounters,fhrh8ee,t1_fhrguia,1581826175.0,Thank you.
creepyencounters,fhrh3xu,t1_fhrgecf,1581826082.0,"That‚Äôs fair enough, but at the same time, ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù is subjective and both my boyfriend and I felt the same way. He was definitely drunk but it didn‚Äôt make me feel any less creeped out by him. A drunk creep is still a creep. And intentionally touching a stranger without even speaking to them or their consent is creepy in any context. 

However tame it may be, I still got a weird feeling about this guy and I don‚Äôt really have any intention of explaining away his creepy behavior towards me. I‚Äôm not interested in normalizing creeps."
creepyencounters,fhrfgit,t1_fhrdc4k,1581824866.0,I‚Äôve been to plenty of bars. I‚Äôve lived in a college town before and at one point was going almost every weekend. I‚Äôve also been touched by guys without my consent at bars and concerts. This guy was still really creepy about the way he did this. If all of my nights at bars were like this I would literally never go back. üôÑ
