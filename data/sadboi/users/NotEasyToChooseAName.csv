Just let your bong soak in rubbing alcohol for a few hours (the stronger the alcohol, the better the results; likewise, the longer you let it soak, the easier the cleaning). When you're ready, add salt to the mix and shake it well. The salt will rub on the dirt in there and remove it for you. It works wonders for me.

Also, what I find really crazy about all of this, is how fresh Hitler is still in everyone's collective memory, and yet how much leeway Trump is getting to act his part. On the other hand, the US was the only country we could say actually BENEFITED from WW2, so I don't think the people over there were affected by it with as much intensity as in Europe.

Shoutout to my man Noam Chomsky! Manufacturing Consent was the single most important documentary I ever saw. That shit really opened my eyes to a lot of things that are going on around us.

surrealmemes,foz9ujq,t1_foxw24k,1588187093.0,"That's pretty much it. Surrealism is all about the juxtaposition of meaning. It's putting together things that normally aren't compatible (like a clock that's melting, but still working fine) and making them seem perfectly natural and logical."
surrealmemes,foz96dg,t1_foxgfph,1588186770.0,"The top posts of this sub are a good place to start. I'd also recommend getting familiar with actual artistic surreal imagery (Dali is my favorite, but there have been plenty of great surreal artists; Escher is another one). You can also look through my post history for inspiration. My most recent posts are more artistic, but in my debut they were definitely memes.

Surrealism is pretty hard to define. In my experience, it consists of two things. First, it needs to tell a story, a coherent one, with its own internal logic that transpires through the piece. If something doesn't make sense within the context of the world you are presenting to us, people will feel it. Let nothing into your piece that is not perfect. The second thing is that it needs to put together things that are normally contradictory, or separate things that normally go hand-in-hand; that's what creates the weird feeling of discomfort most people get when they look at surreal art. As in, in the real world, these two things would never be seen together, but here, somehow, it makes perfect sense. And the more you look at it, the more sense it makes, but the weirder it also gets. That's the essence of surrealism. After that, everyone has their own style, and different people use different techniques (check out ""critical paranoia"", it's my favorite (one Dali himself developed)). The most important thing is that you yourself must believe your own piece when you see it."

Put in more THC than CBD and you'll end up with a stronger weed, more potent, usually with a more cerebral high. Go for more CBD when you want a more physical, relaxing, chill high.

Basically, CBD makes it so your brain absorbs THC in a more diffuse manner, over a longer period of time. That makes for a smoother ""highness curve"", as well as reduced anxiety, paranoia, pain, etc. I have to say that CBD alone won't give you much of a high, although it admittedly depends on what you're looking for and your definition of a good high.

EDIT: Most of the medicinal properties of cannabis are derived from CBD."

Only, it turns out that I randomly worked as a secretary for some guy years ago, who is now governor (or prime minister, or whatever) where I live. So I go to him and ask him if he has any contracts for me. I take him out to a fancy restaurant, pay for a very nice bottle of wine and hand him a brown envelope.

Online dating is no different: once I get to know somebody, I then get to decide whether I want to invest myself in the relationship or not. Adding filters doesn't make it less meaningful, it just prevents random flukes by making sure the other person and I actually share something in common other than the fact we're both breathing. I agree that online dating can feel very impersonal, almost dehumanizingly so at times, but once a connection is established (and I'm talking about a true, human one here, not the ""connection"" you get with someone after exchanging a few text messages), it makes no difference whether we met through Tinder or in a random bar.

philosophy,fjs57nk,t1_fjpga6r,1583593827.0,"I'll answer to your comment in two parts. First, I don't think the contradiction in the statement ""there is no absolute Truth"" is a meaningful one, just like saying ""everything is relative"" brings us to the same kind of contradiction. In both cases, the rule itself is its only exception, thus also making it true on another level. If everything is relative, then even my statement is, which means there actually is an absolute. This absolute is the fact (notice I use the word fact here, not statement, as the statement merely points to the fact) that everything is relative, including the statement ""everything is relative"". Thus, the statement takes on a new level of truth. Whether one considers it true or false only depends on their frame of reference at any given time. I do believe there is no absolute, objective Truth, only subjective ones. I am also conscious of the paradox it brings to my psyche, which I have chosen to embrace instead of reject. I don't believe we are meant to be entirely rational. To people who tell me ""you can't believe X because it is paradoxical"", I reply: ""why not""?

The second part of your comment is more difficult to answer to. To be honest, I don't know enough about existentialism to feel comfortable comparing the two. From what I know, though, existentialism refers to the act of observing one's conditions for existence, whereas nihilism is more like a mindset, like a lense through which we see the world. If existentialism is the algorithm pumping out data, optimistic nihilism is the framework used to interpret said data."

Being a nihilist doesn't mean that you refuse to give meaning to things. It simply means that you recognize nothing as intrinsically and inherently meaningful. Thus, seeing the Universe as a blank canvas, the true nihilist paradoxically sees this as an opportunity to apply their own meaning to it. By doing so, they become the only source of meaning. And since meaning is completely arbitrary and subjective, it doesn't violate nihilism's first tenet: that there is no absolute Truth. You can be a nihilist and still believe you have a purpose in life; it's just that this purpose will be coming from you instead of some cosmic force/entity."
