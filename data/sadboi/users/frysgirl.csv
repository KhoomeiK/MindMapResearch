BPD,fpcc08j,t3_gcmwpx,1588494858.0,"I am really sorry to hear this.

No child you have to endure separation from their family, and to have the cause be your own sibling and no one is supporting you? That’s just awful and I really hear your pain.

My family was similar, I could never do right in the eyes of my mother or my elder brother and they made home life very difficult not only for me but anyone who supported me. I was so desperate for my mothers love, I did everything she asked of me and my brother would set me off and make me so mad (when I was too young to understand and control it) so I was always the problem child.

Eventually I had to learn the sad truth: no one was coming to my rescue, my father and other brother remained silent when I was mistreated and nothing I did was good enough for my mother or elder brother.

And it got to a point where I realised, this is not family. This is not healthy. 

You are worth respecting, you are special by virtue of being someone’s child and if they cannot see that then, in my opinion, why are you pining for it?

As soon as I left home at 18 my mother went on a war path to destroy everything I loved but I just kept my distance, I showed her what behaviour I would respect and respond to and she realised my elder brother had no influence when I was away. 

Now? My elder brother checks in on me once a week and my mother only calls when I tell her I am able to talk.

They set the boundaries, you must reset them. Recognise your worth and they will soon recognise it.

Can you figure out the exact trigger for you in this situation? Was it that she snatched the laptop or did snatching the laptop make you feel not needed or useless, which can be hurtful? Figure out your feelings so you can explain them to her. 

Let each other cool off, nothing is resolved in anger. I know you feel guilty but you need to take this time to really ask yourself what happened, how you felt and how try and understand how she may have felt.

When you come back together be reassuring and loving and say, I know this was never your intention (she loves you, she doesn’t want to hurt you!) but this is what hurt and why I reacted like that.

BPD,fpc5nwk,t3_gcll88,1588488429.0,"Hello and oh boy this was like reading a diary entry from when I was 17!

I hear you, I feel you, I completely understand and I want you to know that things can improve.

It is so stressful isn’t it? It takes so much energy just to exist it seems, right?

I am sorry that this is how things are, it sucks but our brains are such that this is the way they let things go for us.

I’m pretty sure I suffered exactly the same symptoms as you and I couldn’t see a professional until I went to university. I was suffering alone from 7-18 and I just needed to get out of my family home. I hope in that respect you have a safe haven.

I will let you in on what I learnt and, let me tell you, it sounds easy but it is not: you have to learn to let this roll over you. You have to focus on what you want to focus on. Put energy into friendships that really matter and don’t worry about those fleeting friends who said something to upset you.

I’ll tell you another secret: usually (certainly not always) when people put negative stuff towards us, it is about them and their situation and has nothing to do with you. But they are very good at making it seem like your problem because they need someone else to bear the suffering. The more you begin to understand this, the easier life will become. For example, I had a friend constantly put me down and I just couldn’t understand why, it hurt, I talked to other people, I even talked to her but I could get no real response? And then I realised- this is about her! And if she’s it a good enough friend to just realise that and back off then why am I putting such energy in this friendship?

BPD reacts a lot to interpersonal relationships and trust me when I say who is a best friend one day won’t exist to you another and it will hurt but we have to accept that if our psychologies are not compatible, if you don’t feel respected, if they don’t give you an answer then you have to say goodbye. And omg will your BPD give you shit for that, making you feel like you weren’t a good enough friend but you have to listen to the logic and what is good for you. Friendships should never be difficult, they should be rewarding.

It also seems like fostering a more positive outlook may benefit you. You will start to see the good in others, respond more meaningfully in conversation and be more forgiving towards yourself if you me a mistake.

I taught myself to be more positive with a gratefulness journal- 3/5 things in the morning I wake up realising I am grateful for and in the evening take five mins to reflect on 5 things you’re grateful for that happened that day. It eventually, honestly, changes the negative voices in your head. After a week or so of me starting I realised one day on a walk that I was smiling to myself simply because I heard birds.

Honestly, I was exactly the same as you and if you need any advice/stories I am more than willing to share. I know how lonely it can be. I know what it feels like to be in a crowd of smiling people and hate your brain for
Reacting differently.

You can get some DBT worksheets online which may help, call a good mental health hotline in your country when you need to and as soon as you can please seek professional help. This is no small feat and I am rooting for you!

BPD,fpc3tya,t3_gckn0p,1588486709.0,"I am so sorry you are going through this. A marriage is a vow of love, fidelity and respect and we both know your husband is not keeping his promise.

I have been in the same boat and the trust issues have seriously, seriously damaged our relationship and my self esteem. 

My husband (bf at the time) watched a lot of porn and constantly compared me to other women, even my friends! It was heartbreaking but with 0 self esteem where was I gonna go? I was the complete opposite, as soon as I met him there was no other man in the universe, I didn’t even find celebrities attractive!

One day I had enough. I said prove it to me that I’m all you need because you make me feel like (it is hard to type) I am not worthy of being in this world. No more porn, stop comparing me to other women, stop going on these after work “catch ups” alone with other women, just do that for a few months so I know you love me.

He did it, he changed, he showed me I was all he needed. We got married.

Last year I made this very difficult realisation because of something my psychiatrist said to me. I told him I do not have a strong libido anymore and he said well that’s fine, it’s hard for people who are suffering from mental illness to go to that animal state.

What? Animal state what do you mean?

Well imagine sticking your tongue down the throat of someone you find attractive right now, how does that sound?

Gross.

Exactly, sex is about animal instinct, shapes and mood. For women of course it is different there is an emotional connection that is needed.

I went home, my mind reeling. Ok so was it possible, setting aside comparing me to other women because NO that’s a dick move, is it possible watching porn, chatting with women on these sites is all animal? And I am the soul and love and light of his life who of course he wants to sleep with all the time but sometimes if you need to get off you literally just want to see boobs? Have I understood something fundamental in male psychology that makes him so different to me but still...I am the woman of his dreams? How the hell does that work.

Following this thought I spoke very openly to my husband about masturbation, sex and other women. It became clear that I was his soul mate and these other women were just there for brief seconds in his mind to get off.

Could I really be upset about that?

I told him there are definite boundaries and, he was very happy to discuss it, we spoke about the sexual activities both of us get up to and what the other is comfortable with. It brought us so much closer together and the sex now is incredible! 

Having said that, you need to be in a partnership where your SO respects your boundaries and upholds being faithful and, really, that boundary is for you to decide and if he cannot respect it then I am afraid it is going to damage your self esteem greatly and this will only damage the marriage.

Maybe your husband feels you are vanilla or something and would love to have such a discussion and would be willing to stick to the rules because he wants to have this closeness with you and know about your wants.

But he should not be sharing these intimate conversations with other women. That is cheating. You deserve better than that, anyone does. We all need to feel secure and loved, how can you feel that when you know your husband is lusting after other women who you see on the regular?

Honestly if you would be down for it introduce other women into your bedroom by just fantasising together about a threesome.

It’s a big step and not for everyone.

But honestly my partner changed completely. He is so honest with me now and will text me “hey this girl at the bar at work drinks is flirting is that okay?” And depending on my mood I say yes or no and he respects that and that is what leads to the intimacy and amazing sex. 

Just my experience, may not be for you.

Good luck and let us know how you get on."
BPD,fpc2qdp,t1_fpc1ip6,1588485724.0,"Very good way of putting it.

I only recently realised how manipulative I am.

Honestly, I was hiding behind some sort of victim narrative; everyone who ever said they loved me has walked out on me so go ahead! No on could ever love a worthless piece of shit like me so why are you even here!?

It’s tricky because I believe the words when I say them, I feel the pain of a childhood of neglect and adulthood of pain, I want the person I love to understand how much I’m hurting but the truth is, it’s a tactic to control them and get them to stay.

It honestly feels so natural to me that I feel like I’m doing nothing wrong but, like I said, I realised how much it undermines the other persons feelings and wants and if I say I love that person, how can I disrespect them like that? And how can they truly love someone who is manipulating them?

Spoke to my therapist about wanting to change and she said it’s great I recognised it and it will be hard work. I mean I was certain I wasn’t doing anything wrong and now suddenly I have to understand and act on this behaviour in the “bad” category.

It honestly feels like someone has said “oh actually you have to breathe through your feet from now on”. It is going to be TOUGH.

But BPD is so clever and cunning at getting us into these shitty habits. Wouldn’t it be amazing to experience an equal loving and respectful relationship? Well I wanna try for it. No matter how difficult and painful it is to completely rewrite my brain.

And I have also found that there is not much forgiveness for “I’m figuring things out, let me deal” no it was always someone else’s deal.

I think you raise a really interesting point with the idea of actually figuring out what identity means. And you’re right, if rather the world related to my morals and principles than oh so you are not into hockey now...okaaay?

BPD,fpbg9yz,t3_gb5r7m,1588469317.0,"To be honest you will not like the answer.

I need to explain how this way of thinking started.


Once I was out getting drunk with friends and two guys almost got into a fist fight and I turned to a girl next to me and said “what the hell happened” and straight to my face with a wry smile she said:

“Why don’t you just shut the fuck up?” I was completely dumbfounded, my BPD was kicking off in my head spouting all sorts of nasty shit about how I’m worthless and no one likes me. Maybe I misheard? So I said:

“What?” She sighed in exasperation and said again.

“Why don’t you just shut the fuck up.”

That was it. Night was ruined. I wanted to run away and curl up in my bed and ask myself why such a lowly piece of shit like me thinks they can have friends.

The next day, still feeling completely awful, I had to speak to someone because I couldn’t remember doing anything to upset this girl.

I asked a friend who started laughing. She said:

“Oh yeah I saw that. You asked what started the fight but she couldn’t hear you over the music and thought you asked why did guy x say to guy y.”

Oh my god. That was it? A night of twisted anxiety, my head full of bad voices, wanting to hurt myself because I’m worthless...was a misunderstanding!? Why did I trust the bad voices? Why did I give in? Why didn’t I calmly ask her to explain or something?

It was then that I realised. The truth is so far out of my grasp and the bad voice of BPD always tries to convince me otherwise.

So you know what I decided? I decided I most likely won’t understand things and know the truth because of the BPD sending me spiralling. I knew that most likely there will be a mistake in my perspective, especially if it is something bad because that’s what the BPD wants me to think. I had to accept that when my husband says something that upsets me, I have no choice but to let it pass over my head and understand that there is a strong chance I got it wrong. I have to remind myself of the good things, perhaps by looking through my gratefulness journal. when I’m calm ask him what he meant. I also had to explain to him what I go through when this happens so he can exercise patience.

By no means is this a cure and it works...40-50% of the time but when it does it is such a victory. “Hey it hurt me when this happened, what was going on there?” “I’m so sorry, let me explain.”

The key is to tell the bad voices to fuck off. I got good enough at it that as soon as they uttered a syllable I, out loud, would say “fuck off.” It gets hard on hard days. Some months are bad, some years are bad.

It really is realising you have to take the chance on the positive and recognise the hard work you and your partner have to put in.

I hope that maybe some part of this is helpful but I
Know how hard it is to just brush aside negative things when your brain almost adores torturing you with them.

At the wedding I just had to hold on to good memories, to knowing the bad feelings will pass. 

It was incredibly difficult and we had to enter couples therapy to heal from it all.

We still struggle and things are so hard right now that he doesn’t actually believe me that I will change. But out of everyone in my life he made those bad voices
Smaller, he showed them I was worth something. He made me understand that I am worthy of such wonderful love.

So I keep fighting every day. And it hurts every second. 

I’m sorry I know that doesn’t sound like a great future but the good parts outweigh those bad moments significantly, you just have to recognise that they do. They truly do.

Good luck and keep us posted, I am here for you and rooting for you guys!"

BPD,fp5n76a,t1_fp5jhfh,1588334962.0,"I would like to share something to illustrate my point futher.

See this that I posted a while ago about my husband:

""Some other things happened but basically we get home and I’m like wtf you know I hate being around your family can’t you just help me out?

He says I basically called him incompetent.

How? Why is it about you? I was telling them not to worry because we sorted ours very late. Why are your insecurities my problem? Why can’t you take my side? Why, when I get upset, is it always about your feelings?""

And compare it with something else I posted:

&#x200B;

""Hi honey,

I can’t describe how rotten I was feeling for forgetting my passport and making us spend £300 on new flights for tomorrow morning. And on Valentine’s Day!

We never get time together, never get to go away and I messed up.

I felt so small and stupid when booking tickets at the counter and that snide woman looked me up and down like I was a complete idiot.

But as we left the airport you said to me “everyone does it at least once”.

I said: “have you ever done it?” And you replied:

“Well, no, but you are older than me by six months so there’s still time.”

You sweetheart.""

&#x200B;

I have to, I want to, fill my life and memories with the latter. The true reflection of love, not what the bad voices want me to remember.

So with my gratefulness journal I take time out to reflect on these things every day and honestly it is a great exercise in telling my ""your worthless"" voice to shove it. On the bad night, maybe something went wrong, something was lost in communication, but he wasnt trying to hurt or belittle me because I know and I remind myself daily of his love and affection."

Wow I’ve never had anyone say they’re proud of me for this. All I ever get is judgement and worry. Thank you. Wow that really helped me few more confident in my decision to address this.

I definitely would like to know more about psychedelics and your experience- please let me know!

I said in another post I don’t think my quantities are so bad, in honesty the most I’ve ever done is a gram over two days and 3-4 cocktails over that period. And I do that once a month. So I don’t think withdrawal symptoms will come? I have no idea. I recognise the need to change because of the emotional dependency I have with getting high. Like I need it once a month. And I will
Manipulate my husband into getting it for me. That is shitty and he doesn’t deserve that and I am shitty for that behaviour. I thought it was okay because I was in pain. But the real way to deal with psychological pain is to address it, not hide from it. I have been a coward and I don’t want to be anymore. I want to be a good partner and a good friend.

I love to exercise and I think that’s a great point, I’ve been using the lockdown in the UK as an excuse but some things are bigger than “oh I’m shut up at home”.

Thank you so much for your advice, tips and belief in me. Honestly that’s so good to hear when I don’t think I am worth believing in.

Your words have affected me for the better. I think I can do this.

Well done again on overcoming these demons, they’re tricky bastards. I will remember your strength when things get hard."
BPD,fp5jhfh,t3_gba8yw,1588331598.0,"Every morning I wrote down five things I am grateful for and reflect, even for a moment, on how good those things are and how they help me.

And at the end of the day I write down five things I am grateful for that happened that day.

Even little, tiny things like I got ten minutes to myself to have a cup of tea. These things which are so fleeting are realised for the actual impact they have on my mental health.

Since I started this ritual, I noticed I am smiling a lot more at simple things like just taking a walk. It is true- if you make an effort to see positive things, they become more obvious to you and the negative things pale in comparison.

Of course my partner features in my gratefulness journal and i write down things I am grateful for about him/he’s done for me eg:

1. Husband kissed my forehead this morning while he thought I was asleep.
2. Husband made me a cup of tea.
3. Husband told me he loves me without any prompt.

Etc

With these thoughts in my head I am more able to reason with the bad voices that tell me I am not worthy of love- would someone just be looking at me, realise how much they love me and say it unprompted if they really didn’t mean it?

It’s hard, it takes practice. To this day I struggle with splitting.

But every now and then, when I’m about the spiral, a new positive voice chimes in-he chose to be with you because he truly loves you and denying that would be unfair to him. Believe him. Trust him, you know you can. And the spiralling stops.

It took 10 years of being with my partner, it is difficult; you’re changing your whole way of thinking. But it really does pay off.

Best of luck!"

I have a terribly addictive personality and I am a shitty human being when it comes to getting coke. I will convince my husband it’s okay and I’m fine when I know it’s an emotional dependency.

See I don’t do much, well much relative to what I’ve heard other people do. A gram every three weeks over a Friday and Saturday and I have 3-4 drinks that night,
Two glasses of wine per week in other weeks. But I know the emotional dependency is what makes this wrong. I know I should find the strength to deal with the bad voices and not drown them out. It was a difficult few years and I want to go easy on myself. But manipulating my husband shows me it’s not good for me.

Coke gets rid of all my inhibitions, I don’t get that when drinking, I am still a bit self conscious when I drink or I’m drunk and not appealing to talk to. Coke let’s me talk about my sexual desires with my husband openly without fear that he’ll judge me or withdraw.

It has brought us closer together. We have been lacking intimacy because of my BPD and his depression.

Splitting is painful, it throws you completely out of whack and can damage even the best of relationships. 

I think I have come to realise that I’d rather side with the positive things, than the negative side of things. I accept I will probably, most likely, always see things black and white and that sucks, but maybe I can trust the white version of things, because therein lies happiness.

I know it’s not an answer or a cure, but when I split I am more able to remind myself that this feeling is transient and we’ll be back to the white side of things soon.

Having said that, a relationship with lies and deceit, with one party not respecting the other, cannot be sustainable. I say this for both your sakes.

She is chasing the chase, she needs to feel wanted and having that just from you is not enough. I don’t doubt she loves you and adores you but this is to do with her self esteem and that weird animal-like place our brain goes to for sex. So I don’t believe she wants to hurt you. But it is and will damage the relationship in my opinion.

You don’t want to be someone who is paranoid, you want to be secure, who doesn’t? But until your gf learns to love herself I feel you will be facing this for a long time.

Is she in therapy? I would suggest couples therapy. Or perhaps even discussing it open mindedly. My husband and I did that, because I like to flirt and have a rule that I won’t do anything that I would not feeL comfortable telling him about. So openly and honestly I told him I enjoyed it and how did he feel and I would completely respect his opinion and the sanctity of our relationship and to my surprise he enjoyed the idea that I flirt with other men and come home to him! So maybe there is some middle ground.

In all honesty I don’t think your GF is a bad person and I don’t think she wants to hurt you. But her desire for affirmation from others will hurt your relationship. I would end it before it affects your psychology to the point you cannot function in anything less than paranoia.

This is my opinion and of course I don’t know the full story, I wish you and your gf the best for both of you whether that is as a couple or as individuals. I would support either action.

Everyone deserves love and a secure relationship. That’s what you should settle for.

I feel like I get a high when I prove my husband find me worthless/wants someone more than me because that’s the fucked up version of love we were taught.

We need to deprogramme from this insanity. We need some real way of determining our worth. Because we are worth something and the people who told us we weren’t were really reflecting on themselves, not on us. Please believe me when I tell you it was about THEM, not about you.

You are free to determine your worth now that you’re an adult. But it’s hard because you are equally trapped by these voices in your heard put there by people who did not treat you the way you deserved to be treated.

I withdraw from my friends, wondering why they would want to be friends with a loser like me but then I realise, those voices don’t know me and they’ve been feeding me bullshit all my life so I don’t even know me.

I feel for you, of course, these things feel impossible to control and on the large part they are impossible to control. And your husband of course loves you and wanted the hardships of a relationship because you are worth it. You both have strength to be in a relationship, it’s a good place to start.

I know how it feels to feel powerless to BPD and your husband needs to understand how badly this affects you and that it most likely won’t go away. But what your husband needs to see and acknowledge is commitment from you to make things better. Go to therapy, go to couples therapy, get DBT workbooks, try on the good days and tel him you love him but you can’t on the bad days.

Be honest, be vulnerable and let him be vulnerable. Be proactive in your battle with BPD when you can and make sure he knows you’re not a saint, some days you just won’t function but you love him and you want to try, you just can’t today.

I remember watching a psych lecture and the lecturer said “BPD patients can be so empathetic and loving and the next second you are staring into a blank mirror.”

These things have a hold on us. It takes a lot to battle through them."
BPD,fp4id31,t1_fp3sadj,1588299703.0,"Yes and it just goes to show the vice-like grip these emotions have on us.

It’s so hard to overcome."
BPD,fp4hd64,t1_fp3snw3,1588299082.0,"Yes.

I find my personality very contradictory. One second I’m an empath, the next second I need someone to be an empath for me and forget their own troubles.

Is it like that for you?"
BPD,fp4gofs,t1_fp47qp6,1588298653.0,"That’s really interesting.

Is it similar to this situation: my name begins with S and once in high school we had to write our name with a adjective that began with the same letter as our name.

For example: “Seductive S” or “Spectacular S”, I just didn’t feel comfortable with any adjective. Is that similar?

I wonder how we can get to know ourselves better."
BPD,fp4ghtz,t1_foupfd2,1588298539.0,"Haha, same! But it’s not bad right? Just a little flirting."
BPD,fp4ft3w,t1_foulr4n,1588298120.0,"Yes completely.

Only the other day a voice in my head said “he is being so lovely, don’t ruin this” and lo and behold, I ruin it.

The first step is that voice, I suppose. And you clearly have that voice too as you’re aware of sabotaging a relationship.

We have to work with that voice I guess and just trust in it. Sounds so hard but I think we can do it!"
BPD,fp4fntm,t1_foze3uw,1588298029.0,What do you mean?
BPD,fp4fmip,t1_foyp3kh,1588298008.0,"Wow that is tough.

I can relate to the not feeling like anyone will ever love me (is that what you mean?). I feel completely inadequate. 

The paranoia sounds very difficult, especially when you have evidence to back it up. I know how those incidents can cut very deep. 

Are you seeing a therapist currently? Perhaps it will help.

I’m sorry my response is not so useful, but I want you to know you are heard and I understand your pain, it is real and I am happy you shared it with us."
BPD,fp4f44w,t1_fp1ag63,1588297697.0,"Yes absolutely.

It’s like the emotions are manifesting themselves physically. I guess it’s almost proof of how strongly we feel things.

That feeling of the emotion flooding you is so difficult to control."
BPD,fp4ex67,t1_foxrerh,1588297580.0,"Completely understand. I used to feel guilty all the time with my mother demanding my attention only to trigger an episode.

My experience is that I just had to put myself first and put my foot down. If people truly love you and care for you they will understand your boundaries. It took me a long time to realise that even though my family said “I love you” at the end of a phone call, they didn’t love me in the way I needed.

What do you need? You do not and should not have to feel guilty about this. You can divide up your time, 50% to the people who just don’t get it and 50% to yourself.

I wish you the best of luck with this difficult task."
BPD,fp4ekim,t1_fp4ds35,1588297368.0,"Oh goodness that is very difficult. I had a similar family environment.

Do you retreat from these interactions to be alone? Have you found anything that helps?"
BPD,fp4ebef,t1_fozyg6y,1588297216.0,"I understand.

We overthink, we criticise ourselves and we feel at fault all the time. It really is difficult to not read into things and not hear that bad voice telling us “you are what’s wrong hear.”

If I can share my experience, I have learnt to just be honest with people and say “did I hurt you when I did xyz, I respect you and adore you as a friend and I want to be honest with you about how I am feeling. I never meant to hurt you.” And I have honestly found, every single time, the friend is so happy to hear how much they mean to me and responds positively.

I think I have found that a lot of the time I am throwing myself into positions I find terrifying because that’s the only way I will understand the reality of things, not rely on what the bad voice says.

I hope you are doing well today!"
BPD,fp4dxz1,t1_fp10gqu,1588296992.0,"Oh, I completely understand!

But, I throughly myself into the firing line and deal with the consequences because you know what, we are worthy of good friends who understand us and forgive us for our shortcomings.

I think it’s important to realise that we are working on ourselves and we won’t be perfect as a friend but we try and we learn and someone who recognises that is worth being friends with.

Best of luck, I am sure you have so many wonderful traits. Keep working hard on yourself and the benefits will come soon."
BPD,fp4donf,t1_fp2yrb0,1588296838.0,"Yes, I fear this greatly.

I fear that I will make so many mistakes.

You know what though? What a fantastic role mode for children to have someone that is self-reflecting and ready to work on themselves. 

You can raise caring, empathetic individuals who are more aware of their emotions because you are. 

BPD sucks but we can channel these things into positives if we try hard enough. 

I am hoping so."
