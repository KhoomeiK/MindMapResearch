SuicideWatch,fq6olmc,t3_ggzlo4,1589135540.0,"Happy birthday!! 

Try not to focus on things that might you file like a failure, but on the good things you bring to the world. If you can't think of any is just your head blocking them (I can get this can of blockage). 

Live is not question of failure or gain, it's a journey and while you are at it you can find moments to enjoy and ways to grow."

StopSelfHarm,fnzqtm3,t3_g3yma2,1587399117.0,"Hi,

If you like budism I like the book ""start where you are. A guide to compasionate living"" of Pema Chödrön. I copy the beginning here for you:  
 There is no need for self-improvement. All those trips that we lay on ourselves- the heavy-Duffy is feared that we are bad and hoping that we are good, the identities we so dearly cling to, the range, the jealousy and the addictions of all kinds – Never Touch our basic wealth. They are like clouds that temporarily block the sun. But all the time our warmth and brilliance are right here. This is who we really are. We are one block of an eye from being fully awake.  
""Looking at ourselves this way is very different from our usual hàbit. From this prospective we don’t need to change:   we can feel as wretched as you like, and you are still a good candidate for enlightenment. You can feel like the world’s most hopeless Basket case, but that feeling is your wealth, not something to be thrown out or improved upon. There’s a richness to all the smelly stuff that we dislike and so little desire. The delightful things – what we Love so dearly about ourselves, the places in which we feel some sense of pride or inspiration\- These are also our wealth. 

With the practices presented in this book, you can start just where you are. If you are feeling angry, poverty-stricken or depressed ¡, the practices described here were designed for you, because they will encorauge you use all the unwanting thing in your live as the means for awakening compassion for yourself and others.""

But the book I really recomend is

 1. ""You are never gonna feel like doing it."" So just do it now.
