I also would argue that having an interest in cars or motorcycles isn‚Äôt enough. Jess kept up with Rory in terms of pop culture, literature, and references. He was well-read and fascinated by cities. Dean never quite could relate to Rory‚Äôs love of school, reading, or desire to travel. Jess lived in NY, California, and Philadelphia. Dean left Chicago but never discussed missing it or preferring it to a small town. Now, this isn‚Äôt to say that people who are different can‚Äôt be friends but... 

Jess wouldn‚Äôt have put with Dean. And I don‚Äôt think Dean would have wanted to associate with Jess. Think of it as cliques in school, but in this case Jess is a bit of a loner, while Dean is a jock. Furthermore, Jess was dealing with some unhealed and Unprocessed trauma from childhood, having his Dad leave in early childhood, a mother who wasn‚Äôt really a mom, and being shipped off to live with his uncle as means to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù a problem. While we don‚Äôt know for sure- Dean‚Äôs life wasn‚Äôt nearly as traumatic nor was he smoking, drinking, etc. Again, the bad boy vs. golden boy cliche, but it works for a reason. But Dean was also focused on a job, on multiple sports teams- he eventually had that town wrapped around his fingers as he worked for Taylor, helped out with construction in multiple settings, made efforts to please Rory‚Äôs mom. That wasn‚Äôt Jess‚Äôs style.

BeverlyHills90210,ey4p2w1,t3_cve9pe,1566800911.0,"There are a variety I could choose from in Seasons 1-5

Isn‚Äôt it Romantic- This has already been mentioned, but for good reason. The classic start of Brenda and Dylan, that montage of Brenda getting ready with Donna and Kelly, the speaker at school, the end date scene. 

The Gentle Art of Listening- Brenda heavy episode and very moving/relevant then and now. 

Spring Training- There is something so cathartic about a girl helping that team beat those rich kids. 

Spring Dance and Home Again- they go together in my eyes and show such lovely moments for the entire group

Halloween- I‚Äôm such a sucker for this one, it‚Äôs classic and hilarious (costumes and of course Donna) and Steve shines in this episode. 

Everybody‚Äôs Talking About It- Donna standing up to Felice is ahhmazing 

the entire end of Season 2/beginning of 3 plot line with Mexico, the Wedding, France, etc. 

I also am a sucker for any episode once Dylan‚Äôs Dad is introduced again in season 3, the Kelly dieting episodes, and the Senior poll/finale. 

And I‚Äôll be honest- Season 4 is my absolute favorite season so I tend to rewatch that the most- it‚Äôs so deliciously dramatic and fun. From Brenda‚Äôs almost Las Vegas wedding to the Cat on a Hot Tin roof story. And who could forget Lucinda and her sports crazy husband/Guatemalan feasts, the Take Back the Night John Sears pie in the face moment, or Brandon having Kelly come along as his date for Task Force business. Season 4 is rewatchable gold. 

Season 5 would include all the New Evolution Episodes, The Dreams of Dylan McKay, and of course the ‚ÄúI choose me‚Äù episode."
GilmoreGirls,exbmjto,t3_crzn29,1566134213.0,"She wanted it both ways- to be the town darling with the Midwest, makes my mom happy because he changes the water bottle, harmless (relatively speaking) boyfriend AND the new bad boy (again relatively speaking). And she refused to choose until Dean stopped the madness in its tracks at that dance. And while the Dance episode is still (IMO) one of the best Gilmore Girls episodes period, I both love/hate Dean‚Äôs blow up at her. That had been building for awhile and in so many ways, you can‚Äôt blame Dean for finally saying ‚Äúgo be together!‚Äù. Still, Dean‚Äôs complete lack of a backbone/self-esteem is what landed us there. If Rory didn‚Äôt have the guts to end it with Dean and was just going to continue this game- Dean could have stepped up and stopped the idiocy. Of course then you wouldn‚Äôt have a show/drama. 

My point is- Rory and Dean both acted like nothing was happening for way too long. And neither wanted to do something about it. Perhaps there were contemplations on either end. And maybe Rory had the idea that her telling Dean about the car incident could have started the bowl rolling (however, Jess was allegedly ‚Äúgone‚Äù and she didn‚Äôt have that relationship to fall back on). And yet the same three characters seem to do this ‚Äúdance‚Äù right until the end. 

Deans animosity towards Rory in the aforementioned scene is soooo deliciously great. Rory does act like this innocent fawn, like she did nothing wrong.

Yes, I agree- most discussion around older pregnancies are related to fertility treatments but there are outliers- I vaguely remember talk of an Indian Women becoming pregnant near 70. I think I‚Äôm passionate on this subject because my mom had me at age 42, she is continuously mistaken for being younger than she is or older than she is (depending on what she is wearing or the setting she is in). Additionally I have a cousin who was born while her mom was 49 (an unplanned pregnancy at that). Society tends to be judge mental of young moms and older moms, yet we never focus on the age of the father and how this also may effect pregnancy. Just my two cents.

His parents are very much early 2000s middle class, blue collar job and I believe his mom was a nurse. Perhaps Rory could identify with Dean at that level due to her mom working and living a comfortable, but not luxurious lifestyle. I would argue that if Rory had stayed at Stars Hallow High, she may have stayed with Dean much longer. 

The moment Rory enters Chilton, her perspectives around socioeconomic class alter. She begins spending extended time with her grandparents and peers who live vastly different lives than those in Stars Hallow. A perfect example is the Season 1 episode, Concert Interuptus. 

I want to preface that I don‚Äôt believe Rory going to Chilton or even Yale demeaned her moral character or made her a bad person. I think Rory was naturally exploring a world she did not grow up in and was thus curious. Socioeconomic status is a very large encompassing part of GG. Paris had to learn how to live without her parents help, Marty bartends regularly, Lane is always seen working at the diner.
