Carry a handkerchief to open doors if that helps. If you follow the guidelines you significantly reduce your chances of getting it.

Relax as much as you can, take a bath, paint, clean the skirting boards, write a list of all the stuff you have never had time to do (isolation bucket list). 

Practice mindfullness, if we are panicking or anxious we are never truly in the moment. Pick up an object and study it, look closely at it, how does it feel? Is it heavy/light? Bright/dull? Beautiful/ugly? When you do this you are living in the moment and step out of your anxiety. Just try it. 

I paint, I'm shit at it but my brain loves it. I switch off from the voice in my head and just enjoy making shit paintings.

Look at windows for signs of wear / water damage. Are they clean (outside), if not will they be cleaned? Look at floor coverings for wear. Check security on front door and windows. Fire escapes and if they have evacuation procedure.

Ok, so the bottom line is you still need help, please talk to your parents (easier said than done, I know). 

Are there any organisations in Romania that offer telephone support for anxiety/depression? Here in Australia we have Beyond Blue and other similar ones. 

The people you can open up to don't have to be professionals, talking to anyone can help. Often a good chat can help ease the burden. My anxiety lies in raising my children and where I live is very lonely for me but when I do meet another Mum, finding that we share similar problems helps.

As much as this is probably a bad thing to say on a quit smoking forum I'm going to say it. I do not think smoking is the most serious issue here. Your mental health is a lot more important. 

Is there someone you can talk to at school? Maybe explain that you are struggling with stress. High school is hard work in many ways and a lot of people need help to cope. Please talk to someone.

Getting your anxiety/stress under control will put you in a better mindset for quitting. I have serious anxiety and find that smoking is a habitual stress reliever for me, it sucks to be stuck in a loop of self loathing."

Turn the notification sound off, assign ringtones to people you are happy to talk to and just ignore the rest until you are ready to deal with it.

You have to really want to do it. I relapsed and feel so stupid for falling back into the trap. I had utter self loathing and fear when I quit before, the danger of what I was doing to myself was obvious. Now I seem to have a mental block to the really obvious damage i'm doing to myself. 

Allen Carr gives you this mentality, makes you see how stupid smoking really is without chucking all the usual 'scare tactics' at you. The governments advertising of the dangers of smoking is useless, we have already made the decision to smoke when we buy the packet and the images and aversion to them creates stress which makes us want to smoke. It is  clever psychology and in a way devious advertising.

Write down the reasons you want to quit, download the Allen Carr audiobook, listen while you smoke. Finish the book at your own pace, but finish it. I never did, but I will this time.

He turned on the bedside light and left the room, I was so angry because I was trying to sleep. I was shaking with rage and suddenly the light went 'pop' and it went off. I got up and checked it, it wasn't the bulb but the entire thing had packed in.
