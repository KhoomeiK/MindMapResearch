i only exfoliate my legs before i tan. i find i don't need to do my arms or chest because i usually just apply lotion beforehand and i don't have dry skin!

it's a great everyday foundation for me when used lightly or i can layer & use it for going out! 

some other foundations i enjoy are

-too faced born this way (can tend to look cakey but i apply moisturizer very liberally when i use this one) 
-the it cosmetics cc cream
