Hypothyroidism,fomlf1x,t1_fomlafp,1587894454.0,"Im not sure how that would affect you. Talk to your doctor. If yoy can do a cam visit, do that. My case was primarily caused by lithium screwing up my thyroid [as it apparently is known to do] but for a disease like hashimotos there is probably more that needs to be done to manage it. Like I said my case was strange and had I not been on lithium I may never have gone hypo in the first place.

For my knowledge what does hashimotos do exactly different than regular hypothyroidism?"
Hypothyroidism,foml6hs,t1_fomkkgt,1587894187.0,"I started down this journey back in 2015. I got hit super bad. Everything swelled, I was miserable and gaining weight rapidly. Couldnt figure it out til I saw a doctor and he looked at me and said ""hypothyroid"" thoufh he wanted to rule out other stuff. First test for TSH on 4/28/15 showed me at 3.55 ulU/mL...

Did another test on 5/8/15 and I was 5.03 ulU/mL. 
T4 free was 0.95 ng/dL [low end of normal]
T3 free was 3.19 pg/dL [normal]

Of course i knew what none of these meant.....still don't truly but numbers have been moreso within the green range on my lab results so who even knows"
Hypothyroidism,fomk7qk,t3_g8bepu,1587893131.0,"I...think I am? So my hypothyroidism was mostly [if not completely] caused by me being on Lithium for my bipolar. I have long since stopped lithium usage, switched to a different med and I have seen no real change from my thyroid meds. Have been off of them for about a few months and I think Im doing fine??? I need to get lab work to double check but I think Im managing alright. Of course my case is probably very different from others here."

loseit,fomjtj3,t3_g8b4k3,1587892700.0,"Slowly incorporate healthy things you like into your diet. Thats what I'm doing. Exercise like walking is wonderful because its less intense and can still be beneficial [my gym is closed] and take things one day at a time. If you totally cut out junk you are more likely to relapse and start eating super horrible again. Baby steps can work. 

I find salads with egg and my fave low calorie dressing are wonderful snacks atm as well as flavored seaweed snacksm Im also trying to do lower carb myself so i have my own hurtles. My job is switching from being fairly active [warehouse picking on the ground] to very less so [powered industrial trucks for the whole building] and im trying to not have that affect me. Im very tempted to switch buildings just to keep active while at work, but I'll have to wait til more openings appear.....

Feel free to message me for someone to chat with and perhaps someone who can help keep you sticking to small goals. I could always use a friend like that too. Keep at it and try not to get too discouraged. Just take things slow."
