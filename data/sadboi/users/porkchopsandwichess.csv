I've also wrapped those headband ""buffs"" around my arm before I leave, and will pull them up over my hands if they get too cold. 

When it gets below -25 you can add in a hand warmer (you can get disposable cheap ones at Can Tire) or more mitts to layer.  

Below -30 you're just SOL and have to just give'r as long as you can. I end up balling my hands up inside the gloves to stay warmer. I've had to cut runs short too. Physically you just have to sometimes. Especially when the fingers get to stingy ouchey cold level.

Although places like Walmart often have a section of marked down meats that are almost at their due dates for pennies on the dollar (I freeze them for later).  

Typically in winter our veggies and fruits are priced like rare gems, so I resort to frozen (no name brands are cheaper). Usually I just make combinations of rice/pasta, beans, meat, veggies, and ""sauces"" from either cheaper salad dressings or sour cream and salsa, or condensed soup (like a can cream of mushroom).   

Stores often have massive sales on their near expiring products - you can freeze most! I even get the older breads and freeze them to keep around for easy carb snack with peanut butter. Or freeze older pitas and make simple pita pizzas (just add a little tomato sauce, left over meat, a little cheese, and bake).

running,f9qfh05,t1_f9q4hht,1575560265.0,"This is going to sound like some weird hippie dippie magic, but this actually does work in a lot of cases:

Take note of your breathing pattern while running and getting a stitch. You'll realize you typically breath to the same beat as your legs step. What you want to try is the opposite of how you're pattern is. So, for example, if you are breathing inwards as your left foot lands down, force yourself to change that to breathing outwards as your left foot lands. Switch your pattern. See if this helps (it won't be an instant stitch-be-gone, but you'll notice it starts going away and then you're fine).
 

Give it a shot. This is often the cure for my stitches."

A) I'll set a workout so my brain doesn't really appreciate the distance as *far*: instead of 12km, I write it in my schedule as 3km warm up, 2km threshold, 2 km marathon pace, 2km threshold, 3km cool down - suddenly it doesn't seem like a long run (and it's good to mix up paces). 

B) if it's an easy run I have to do at one pace, I'll write it out in portions (2km warm up, 5km easy, 1min rest, 2km E, 3km cool down). In the end it's still the same distance and effort but my brain thinks ""pffff really only a few kms at a time."

There's always an excuse if you look hard enough, but the only person they are cheating is themselves.

Dude, I wasted so much money on JDM cars and mods in my late teens that if I added it up I'd actually be out of debt right now. It is the worst ""investment"" you can make. Seriously. It's a literal pit for your money. And if you're young, and start this downward spiral now, it is just going to haunt and follow you for decades. You may as well take your cash, stuff it into an empty oil jug (good news, you'll have lots to repair your 15 year old Nissan every week anyway), and light it on fire.  

I absolutely wish I had had someone sit me down and give me this advice of looking elsewhere to throw money into. I'd be living an entirely different life right now. Entering this money trap is a poor, poor idea. It seems exciting to have a fancy looking car, but it is honestly worthless and you'll regret it. It's a headache both for your money and your patience.  

*Please* look into a different plan. Don't make the same mistake. I can legitimately attribute my hardship of finances with no end in sight in my mid 30s to having started importing and wasting money on cars in my early 20s.   

I get it, I love jdm cars and modding. the allure is captivating... but it's not worth it. You can still have a sweet ride that isn't going to destroy your income if you're smart about it... It just may not be as fast and furious."
