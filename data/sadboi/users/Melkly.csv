ptsd,fr50ogw,t3_gmosod,1589900392.0,"This is going to sound morbid and i can't figure out wording to not make it sound bad. 
 
But thank you for this dream and this is interesting. 
 
I love dream interpretation, and I don't dream so to have access to someone's dreams is nice. 
 
It sounds like you experienced loss and grief at a young age, witness stuff a child should never witness. It sounds like there is a fear in you that's growing and it stems of a sense of lack of control. 
 
Dreaming of killing animals you love and dreaming lack of empathy must have been terrifying. 
 
It sounds like your brain is starting to notice old connections that have been corrupted or destroyed because you had to survive. 
 
Killing an animal and feeling a rush in a dream. I can see how traumatised people would do anything to feel something. 
 
Now because I am no professional, this is more of an experimental idea than anything. 
 
If you can without hurting yourself or make yourself uncomfortable, could you meditate and try and rebuild compassion and empathy towards yourself? 
 
The theory i have is that your empathy connections were damaged when you had to survive, and recently your brain has been doing inventory of trauma and found these connections frayed and fragile. Meditation is an effective way to help reprogram or repair broken or damaged connections. 
 
I did this for myself. And found carrying results. 
 
A little about myself: i am an empath, i love aninals and people and I have a big heart. 
 
I also get so annoyed with sounds that I have to restrain myself from kicking a cat. 
 
Its terrifying. These animals i saved from trauma and the street, turn into targets for me because a fan is blowing, or a vacuum is on. I hate it because it makes me feel weak, and like im betraying my heart. 
 
So I meditate on my bad days. I hate that I have the impulse to hurt life. It makes me sick when i think about it. But i know it isn't me, it is my brain trying to express something to tell me something, so I listen to my anger in those moments. 
 
Yesterday, I almost lost control. My anger almost controlled me. Then i realised that aside from anger I was also feeling vulnerable, and lost, and out of control.  It wasn't only anger/rage, there were deeper emotions. Once i realised this, I focused on something I could control, my hands. I did my 5 sense grounding, and then I decided to focus on what I could do. 
 
For me, I get over stimulated. It is caused by a mixture of trauma, ADHD, and possible Asperger's. 
 
Drugs won't fix impulses only dull them. So for me it was important to start working on myself in anyway I could. Running/biking, art, and meditation are my 3 things i use to keep the lack of control somewhat maintained. 
 
You keep having these dreams. Of being violent. 
 
I guess you got a few questions to ask yourself. 
 
If you want therapy? And how you want therapy to help you.
 
What is the emotion you feel after the violence? Is it safety, pride, validation, release, pleasure, nirvana, relief? What is under your first emotional reaction. 
 
And do you want to keep that reaction or not?
 
What do you want to change or better about yourself?
 
And what are you willing to temporarily sacrifice to get there?
 
And do you believe you deserve love and happiness?
 
These questions will help you decide what kind of therapy you want to do, as well as help you help them by being a little more introspective. 
 
My dad faced some hellish trauma growing up. His dad ordered him to kill his coop of pet hens with his bare hands. If my dad had access to todays therapy, and today's information I bet he could have broken the abuse cycle instead of continuing it.
 
I believe 100% you can be the person you want to be. I don't think these impulses are set in stone yet. I believe you are not heading down a bad path, but are at a fork in the road. 
 
For me, if i was in your shoes I would ask myself *how to get to long term happiness from where I am right now*. And then work my ass off to make that come true.
 
Figure out how you feel under the top easy accessible emotions, and you will figure out what to do with these dreams and impulses. 
 
There is more than good or bad. There is a lot of grey. Change doesn't happen over night, and if you feel you are too much on one side of the spectrum, grey means change is happening and you gotta be patient and not give up. 
 
You got good in you. And hope. Use that as a guide. If you focus on not being your father, you are still focusing on your father and your trauma. Have a positively worded goal ""I want to be, the person I needed."" ""I want to be a kind and just leader"" ""I want to be a good friend"". Simple wording can move mountains. 
 
What sounds more motivating:
 
I want to be able to help others in ways I never had
 
Or
 
My dad did this to me, and I will never be like him
 
Which one, if you repeated daily, would make you smile?
 
A hard truth is you will be like your dad. 
 
Just like I am.

 
My dad had a big heart like I do. We both faced trauma. We both had horrible childhood because of our dad. We both witness shit. 
 
But he didn't know he had the option to be happy, instead of survive. 
 
You and I have that option. 
 
I don't think my dad was happy. Who beats their kid for stealing a collector's card and is a happy person. Maybe if he could have work through his trauma and emotions and world perceptions, maybe I wouldn't exist, but he would have been healthy.
 
But he didn't have that option and was a terrible abusive father who deserved his end. 
 
And I am lucky I have a big heart and to live in 2020 where I have unlimited access to mental health articles and communities, and information. 
 
To break my pattern, I accepted my dad was a victim like me, so it was personal choices that would make us different. He isn't to blame for my actions after the abuse, i am responsible for myself. 
 
It doesn't really matter how you got broken if you choose anything other than being better than yesterday. And to know what *better* means to you. 
 
Your dad fucked you up, but is it him you are healing for or yourself? If he isn't the reason you are healing he should have no place in your new thoughts. ""I will be better than my worst fears."" ""I will be choose my happiness"" ""I will be the person I needed"" they all mean you will be better than your dad as a core concept, but you are not focusing on him. 
 
This healing is all about you. Where do you want to go? Who do you want to be? What do you love about yourself?
 
A glass knocked off a table, or over heated in a microwave will still break the glass. It isn't about how the glass broke that is the important part, but how to clean up the mess without making it worse.
 
I am so sorry you experienced such vicious and horrible things. I can't imagine the emotions you carry inside. 
 
I hope you well."

I personally never wanted to live with a ""what if"" and I wanted the child to have the best possible life. So that's why I chose adoption. 
 
1. I was 18 and immature and knew it
 
2. I wanted this kid to grow up with chances I never had
 
3. Taking a potential is hard for me, I cant throw away pens or kill house flies. So abortion was my last option if my health was at risk.

You mean you prefer feeling out of emotional control vs feeling calmer?
 
Do you currently like who you are?
 
I genuinely ask because if you don't like who you are but you don't want to change, medication won't really help. 
 
I assume you don't like the bad parts of you. 
 
Which I would have to question, what part of you is bad?
 
To answer the question :when is it right?
 
You gotta ask what you are willing to sacrifice to get the life you want and deserve. 
 
I was terrified of starting ADHD medication, because I loved who i was without it genuinely. I loved how i thought and worked things out, and the speed. That was an easy 16 years ago, and now I wish I had medication because the symptoms of ADHD I loved became overwhelming and impossible to manage without a cocktail of drugs, coping mechanisms, and a strict routine. 
 
So let me ask you, what would the drugs ease the burden of? And is that worth the side effects?
 
My bf got diagnosed with acute depression. His biggest fear is meds. For the same reason as you. Control problems, body image problems, *happy as himself*. Aka he doesn't know what to expect and therefore cannot prepare for the worst and then the cliff hanger of unknown chokes him into a corner. So i told him ""medication is to make your life easier. If the side effects are worse than your reality, stop em, but if your reality gets better, would it be worth it?""
 
My social worker told me this: medication should be a crutch that you use until the connections and patterns and routines are in place. Medication at best should only be a short term goal or else tolerance builds and you will be medicated for the rest of your life and Melkly you expressed you didn't want that. So if we do get you on medication it is only to be used as a guide and support, not a long term solution.
 
Knowing that i have options with medicine helps me feel better about any changes I want to do in life. I don't want to be medicated until 70 i just want to live life easily."

You like the gun because it gives you a sense of control. 
 
But if you start hitting the risk zone for self harm, you won't be able to control the urge to take your life. 
 
Making the decision to suicide happens within an hour, mayne even 5 minutes. 
 
Her making sure you don't have access to hurt yourself is her job. 
 
Finding a sense of control without a weapon is yours. 
 
Did you know that if you are male, with a mental illness, under stressful conditions, with access to a firearm, you are the average statistic for suicide. You are the main demographic of people who took their lives. Even more so if you are 15-23.
 
A gun is a double edged sword. It makes you feel in control of situations you cannot control leading to a sense of safety, but it is more like OCD then anything. ""If i have my gun I can protect myself, I can save others. If I have my gun i am safe. If I have my gun, my life is under my control."" 
 
And those positive thoughts hide the ""if i have a gun, i can take my life when I want. If i have a gun, i can express my anger and sadness. If I have my gun i can express fear.""
 
A gun isn't supposed to be an expression of emotion. It is supposed to be a tool, like a car. Used in specific conditions, properly trained and insured.

ptsd,fr0w89y,t3_glupw9,1589808188.0,"What helped me before getting a therapist is outlining how i got it. 
 
I got it because my brain couldn't handle the reality before my eyes. I had to recount and relive my trauma and my brain tried to save me from on going pain. I also accept that PTSD is supposed to be a short term solution to help ourselves, and when we prolong the trauma things will get worse. 
 
Going against core beliefs fucks up a person more than we like to believe. Putting on an emotion we are not feeling fucks us up. 
 
My trauma is sexual in nature. 
 
First thing I would suggest is to also check out r/cptsd if your trauma was on going.
 
It can get better, but it wont be easy. 
 
In my perception, PTSD treatments and therapies are the same tools and techniques we use to raise healthy children. 
 
Get in contact with your emotions, point to the emotion on the card. Play with your toes, make up a toes song, touch the toes. I took the same principals and applied it to myself. 
 
I started with emotion. When i had flashbacks, i would do everything i could not to see it from my memory but from a 3rd person. It helped me see that i was helpless and that I did 100% everything I possibly could have done. For me, my reaction was to freeze, then flee. I couldn't fight, my life wasn't in danger, but my future was. 
 
Accepting I could not change the events, helped things. 
 
If you could have
 
You would have
 
So don't think you should have done anything
 
You don't need that burden. You did everything you possibly could for the situations you were in. 
 
Learning about memory helped me as well. 
 
Memory is a cycle. You get the event, it combines with an emotion, does a few relays around short term memory before falling into long term memory, and eventually forgotten. 
 
So what was PTSD doing to my memories routine?
 
To me I figured when it would relay in my short term, it would attach to an emotion and start the cycle again, augmenting the pain each time making it worse. I figured that was an important cycle to stop. 
 
I looked it up ""how to something something memory better"". 
 
Meditation, and hallucination drugs were my 2 favourite answers for me. I couldn't afford a therapist or money for meds, but I could drop 30$ on some mushrooms/peyote tea, pop on some guided meditation and do my best for 6 weeks. I chose 6 weeks because that's the average time it takes most drugs to show if they are effective or not and the side effects. So what could meditation every night or every few days do for me?
 
So I started self medication. I bought some drugs and took the smallest amount i could. It is now called micro dosing. 
 
Took mushrooms twice in my entire life. The first time, I cried. I just kept crying. I was happy and crying. I was thinking and crying. I tried meditation and i was crying. But the next day, I felt lighter. I did my meditation as usual (sober in a sun spot), and it was easier to focus on not focusing. And about 6 months later I did some therapy with a social worker and my self worth and esteem improved. 
 
At that point I had been suffering for about 10 years with the aide effects of experiencing trauma. And that was mt first break in the pain. 
 
I kept up the meditation and kept up the child like skills and found some talk therapy to work on my self image and esteem and worth. 
 
The worst part of my PTSD is over but I keep finding new things out. 
 
I am a woman, and after mt trauma my PMS changed. I went from Jekyll to Hyde. I went from no cramps, no emotional swings, I couldn't tell when it was coming aside from the day of the month. AND EVERYTHING CHANGED WITH THE TRAUMA ATTACKED. Now science and medicine say that with age my PMS symptoms got worse. So bad infact that they mimic PMDD and triggered attacks. This got me thinking, what if just because the memory and emotions are gone, what if there is residual trauma that triggers smaller things. 
 
I now watch what i eat because of my allergy. The immune system responds to trauma, and if I keep upsetting my immune system I don't heal. If you keep eating things that make you bloated, crampy, gassy, and bad your body releases CORTISOL the stress hormone, and the wake up hormone, and the anti-inflammatory hormone. Cortisol is a useful fucker, but not while dealing with trauma. The body wants to help stop the inflammation the food/drink so it sends out a multi-tool for the job. But after a while, it builds up and things get rougher.
 
I find popping 2 tylenol and 2 Advil in the middle of my attacks help. Or Aleve /arthritis meds. They don't always work but when I'm desperate I try.
 
So I took a scientific look at myself and decided to work on individual symptoms and it worked for me. 
 
I use pot to sleep BUT ONLY if there is an absence of anxiety and paranoia. I never smoke when anxious, that's like throwing water into a deep fryer. A massive nay nay. (After smoking nightly for 3 years it is noe affecting my disassociation). 
 
I use exercise, diet, and meditation to maintain my mental health. I call up doctors and therapy to help better my mental health. 
 
And I never give up because today is 10000000× better than the day of my trauma, it is 10000× better than the nightmares 100× better than the constant self shame and 10× better than yesterday.
 
Having a goal to look forward to will help keep motivation. 
 
For me it was ""be the person I needed"". Every decision I make, I ask myself ""would this person be able to help 15 year old me?"" At 29 i can finally say yes. After 14 years of bullshit and trauma and life pain, I am now the adult me and my friends needed back in highschool.

************

You have a choice, I know it really feels like you don't, but you do. You can choose how you want to be when not dealing with your head. My family thought they couldn't choose and that this was their fate. They accepted the pain and got comfortable with it never checking themselves to see how they were treating others. 
 
Because of my Dad's childhood abuse, my family broke apart. He still had his 9 year old heart, but with the responsibilities of an adult. He had to raise a family, with the echoing whispers of the lives he took unwillingly. He made decisions based on his experience because he didn't have a personal behaviour goal. He was a great runner, so i often ask who he would be if he focused on healing his pain and not avoiding it.
 
It can get better. But it is up to you to decide what kind of better you want. 
 
You are a good person who went through living hell. There isn't much I can say to comfort that fact. 
 
Thank you for reaching out for help. You matter and deserve peace and happiness. You were in an impossible situation trying to survive and stay alive. That doesn't make you a monster or a bad person. It makes you worthy of love and respect. A bad person wouldn't be feeling what your feeling. They'd feel joy in place of horror. They wouldn't question their actions. They wouldn't ask for help to stop the pain.

That's how your question sounds. 
 
How do you keep on moving forward? Well by moving forward. 
 
You seem to think your life events and your therapy isn't connected but it is. What you will learn in therapy will help you handle the stressors, and the stressors will keep coming so you can practice the skills you learned in therapy.
 
Self harming: your therapist should know about this to help implement better coping mechanisms than the instant *gratification* of self harm.

Then i would figure out what is the most important thing to learn from this professional that I can use when i no longer have access. 
 
And thirdly, i would start with healthy routines today. I would make a bullet journal tracker, and make sure I am meditating, eating, drinking water, sleeping, and exercising. Those 5 things are the basic needs of humans. Meditation is the same as child's play but more focused. If you have a child you will grab their feet and make up a feetsie song, in meditation the song is stripped of melody and turned into a mantra.
 
Get a solid foundation of self care and healthy coping mechanisms, and the rest of life stops being a mountain. 
 
You have a lot to work through, make a list of what you want to work on and why so when you need a reminder you don't have to start from scratch.
 
Ask your therapist to help increase your sense of self worth and identity. If you can believe in yourself to get through anything, then facing stressors becomes a self improving challenge and not an obligation."

I'd rather see him smiling looking st his phone over getting anxiety attacks. 
 
Ask your gf why she feels she must control you. Be kind and calm, but just call her out on this. Why does she perceive you as someone unable to be responsible or honest?
 
If she can't answer that, you gotta put your mental health first. You gotta put your pain above her and you gotta understand that she is unhealthy and it is 100% up to her to change not you to help heal her or guide her or stay with her. 
 
She is the toxic one. She needs to be responsible for her actions and words. And if she is being toxic and abusive, she needs to change. 
 
If she refuses to change, you gotta accept that as fact and make a decision on the information you have TODAY and not on who she was before or who she can be. 
 
In the present. Would you choose her? Knowing everything you know about her today? Would you decide to date her knowing that she has this control problem? If you were a friend, how would you talk to her about her need for control?
 
And what kind of relationship do you want with her? Is it what you currently have? Cause who she is today is who she is today. If you cannot accept her today, tomorrow will not get better. 
 
You have 2 options. Change your perception of her, change your perception of yourself. 
 
You cannot change, help, or fix her. That is on her to do. 
 
So what can you do to make yourself happier and healthier?"

My dad also had a horrible childhood, he was severely traumatised by his dad. I see cptsd symptoms in my memories of him. 
 
But that doesn't take away the fact that he did not have the tools from 1963-2015 to handle his mind, and his trauma. 
 
If you want to heal from your dad, you got to accept that his brothers and sisters saved his life. He owes them or feels like he owes them because they saves his life and kept him sane, and kept him alive. 
 
My dad didn't break the cycle. I am. I lost my relationship with my brother because of what my dad did. 
 
Maybe your dad has survivors guilt. Maybe he witnessed horrible things. 
 
Dealing with this is much bigger than you.
 
Have you tried talking to your dad about his neglect from a point of understanding that he did absolutely everything in his power to keep you and his wife sade?
 
Like if you talked to a woman survivor of rape, would you blame her for keeping her children away from her abuser or that she may see danger where there is none?
 
Men haven't been allowed to express or show emotions for a very long time. Their rapes are not recorded. Their suicides are higher. Their silence is deafening.
 
I know you are hurting and in pain from your dad, but compassion and empathy is needed right now. To understand why your father believed neglecting you was a safer option than helping his siblings can help you change your inner perspective. 
 
My dad favored me over my brother because my dad saw himself in me. He saw the fragile child he was before his dad slaughtered his pet bull, made him kill his pet hens (one by one by hand). My father and his siblings were so scared of their dad that after an fire burn my dads rib cage, they hid him in bed for 20 hours. They had to peel the bed sheet off of his infected side.
 
My dad saw some shit. So I understand his abuse and how he understood it as love. 
 
So if his definition of love looked like it did, what the hell did mine look like?
 
My dad influenced me but i am in control of me. In the end he died and I am happy, just as he was happy with his dad died. But I know where he went wrong, and it is up to be to fill those holes on my own. No explanation or amount id therapy for him could ever make me feel as good as I can when I am in complete control of myself. 
 
My dad left me with some horrible scars. 
 
But also a heart that can raise the morals of strangers and friends alike. If my dad was born in 1990 he would have been like me. But I can't change that he wasn't born with child protection services, therapy and guidance counselors, he wasn't born into an idea of community and had no ones help when he needed it. He had no Reddit to ask how to escape his abuse. 
 
If your dad was born in your place, what would change for him? What di you think getting proper help and support when he needed it could have changed?
 
He went through some stuff and wasn't a good father. But he is more than your dad. 
 
If you don't like who you are because of his trauma you got to change that yourself. His trauma was never dealt with internally. He never had a forum of people supporting his ideas to get healthier. 
 
He didn't have the privilege of being born more recently. 
 
You can't blame or control that. What you can control is yourself, your actions and your behaviours. It is your life. You gotta keep control of it. Hoping or blaming others for making you like this is only the first step (identifying), the second step is deciding how you will handle what you've identified, then the last step maintaining or changing it to fit your needs.
 
It doesn't matter how you got here to therapy. That isn't the focus. The focus is the fact that you are hurting, you are in pain, and that is something only you can deal with. You dad has his own life he needs to be responsible for. You got yours.

If you are honestly happy right now, never being able to stand up for your needs, and having someone clear the way for you, than adult hood is going to suck. It sucks for NT who have parents protect them from learning how to be independent, but for people like us it could mean life or death out there. 
 
I was never 18 at home with a parent who paved a way for me. My mom kicked me out at 16 because she couldn't handle my empathy.

It also comes off as if you are scared of being responsible, and you gotta ask yourself why. Why do you believe you cannot support yourself and believe in your capabilities?

I would rather live on my own, surrounded by my special interests, never masking, never changing myself to please others, never hating myself on behalf of someone else.

I love being able to binge my special interest in my own healthy way, where I will never get ""wow why can't you be like this in different aspects of your life"" or ""I'm worried, that isn't healthy."" ""Its okay she is just a little different.""
 
I can't imagine having the freedom of expression I have now. I definitely couldn't believe that at 29 this would be my life. Do you know how happy i am compared to 11 years ago? I have collections, HOARDS of my special interests and the people in my life feed my passions. Actually enable my weird hyper focused ass. I have so many pens, in so many colours, 8 year old me would be speechless. I have 3 cats and a dog and an indoor jungle. I am also praised weekly for my preferred personal traits. 
 
I am still trapped by thinking of what others think of me. 
 
But I no longer want someone to guide me in life. How can they know what makes me happy, and what will keep me happy? They don't know me as well as i know me, so why should they decide my life. 
 
The paper work you learn tricks for. You look for specific words and patterns, and accept that 1. You are responsible and 2. They will use that against you if you mess up.

Step 4. Thank them for their time and understanding
 
I often bring something with a straw with me to confrontations because I cry at criticism. How the hell I was a kitchen supervisor/manager, is a shock to teenage me. I had to tell people they fucked up because my boss told me all the ways I could have been better. I learned that cry and swallowing cancel each other out and helps prevents crying. And keeps you hydrated when you do cry. I do not recommend fizzy drinks for this cause you could throw up. 
 
The rest is scary because it looks so amazing to watch other people go through it we often don't believe we can do it. 
 
How do you know what cell phone plan or hydro plan is for your needs. Well you make a big mistake, have a panic attack for a few weeks, and realise that in those weeks you were freaking out you missed important things to you and you vow you won't loose time again to hating your mistakes.

So that means you are in a perfect and rare position for yourself. 
 
Who do you want to be in 5 years and how will you get there? 
 
With all the current truths you have and all your current perception, where do you want to go?
 
You believe your eyes and your head and your heart right now. You believe in yourself and how you see the world. Soon he will do his best to ruin that for you. He will be actively working against your best interests. 
 
Your truth is valid. Your pain is real. You are not over reacting. 
 
With the cold comfort of knowing the truth, you have to act on that before you doubt yourself. 
 
You are fragile and hopeful that this pain is temporary. And it will be if you can keep control of yourself and your head. 
 
You are not over reacting. 
 
Keep the anger you have boiling inside, let that anger be a marker for more injustices in the future.
 
Your pain is real. 
 
He wont see it. He chooses not to. So if that is his decision and his choice, time to make yours. You have a freedom to choose now in a way you didn't before. You're not bound by ""he would do the same for me"" lie. Now you get to put yourself first, probably for the first time. 
 
You don't have to fight for his attention. He chose not to give it, so you can choose to stop looking for it. Find validation and acceptance in a different group, and rebuild yourself to be the version of you that you want.
 
Your truth is valid. 
 
If for years you've been trying to get noticed by him, and walk on egg shells, and hold your breath around him hoping for a change, now is the time you've been waiting for. You wanted him to change, probably for the better. You probably let him be responsible for himself and supported him and loved him as an extension of yourself. But you two didn't have the same goals, he didn't want to change for you. He might not want to change at all. Can you accept that?
 
Your love was not wasted here. He gave you a chance to see how deep and amazing your love is. It isn't your fault he couldn't appreciate it, but it is your responsibility to care for it. He showed you how much love you can offer anyone. But because he didn't maintain the relationship your love for him dried up and got corrupted into co-dependancy.  
 
Use your reservoir of love on yourself. You can refill that hole you feel by trusting yourself and believing yourself and knowing that you are so amazing. 
 
You have a big heart.  
 
Time to turn it towards yourself and do what you have to so you can continue to be the best version of yourself. 
 
He gave you a chance to be kind and wonderful. His abuse of that doesn't reflect poorly on you. It makes you look amazing and warm and kind and makes him look immature. 
 
I wont tell you to end it, cause that's what i would do. 
 
But rather i believe in you to make the right choice for you and your future. You are not alone. So many of us have been here. But you gotta start being responsible for your happiness from this point forward. You have options now, if you need guidance choose the paths that lead to long term happiness, not immediate. If you need an immediate boost, binge on some chocolate, watch The Spy Who Dumped Me, drink some hot tea or water with lemon and honey or lime and brown sugar or coffee grounds. 
 
The heat will help warm your trembling hands. 
 
The chocolate will boost some feel good hormones to knock the edge off of the pain.

For me, i feel it has a lot to do with the gender and race in power. Because it shouldn't be one gender or one race to rule the free world. 
 
I bet the world has been out of balance since women were seen as objects. 
 
For too long has the lives of the women, LGBT+ been objectified. Then race got introduced. And now we have straight white men ruling the planet and the world is out if balance. 
 
I wonder what the world would be like if women didn't ""have a place"", if other coloured skinned people didn't ""have a place"". 
 
What was the world like before wheat and corn domesticated us. I cannot believe it for one second women sat at home picking berries and men chased high caloric meat. If women haven't changed, and we were always as we are today, the greatest hunters would have been a mixed bag of genders and sexualities. Cause it couldn't matter about the gender/sexuality but the capability of an individual to help keep the tribe/community healthy and safe. 

And with the call back of min wage workers (56% women, (30% white women) 4%LGBT, and 25% POC) it isn't an act to save the economy but is rather an act of war on the minorities. *Traditional* women jobs are called essential (care givers, nurses, old people care, retail, customer service representative, teacher's day care workers) and are being told to risk their lives for the economy. 
 
They are not being asked to sacrifice themselves for a cause they believe in like the men who went to war. 
 
They are being told to work or die.

""I'm telling you this because i trusted you. But after I told you i was hurting and you defended the actions and words that were the cause instead acknowledging my pain. I wonder what long term consequences this will have to our friendship.""
 
It has saved a lot of friendships by calling them out on their defense because it is clearly not the conversation I wanted to have and I won't be to blame when I walk away from toxic situations *to me*. 
 
That being said, I came up with a solution to help deal with these situations in the future. If i have 2 stories about the same event, I eliminate the contradictions and focus on the evidence. 
 
Lets say Don and Allison have two stories. Don is the father and Allison is the child. Allison would be the first to find me, and tell me her story. Her dad would go through her dirty laundry and pull out all her dirty underwear and then shame her genital up keep, she would feel violated and betrayed and scared because it is clear she has no privacy and a grown man is asking about her genitals.
 
Don would say he is looking out for the health and well being of his daughter. He was trying to protect her from herself because she often avoids showering/bathing herself, her home work and general time management, so he punishes her to help teach her better hygiene. 
 
Here it looks like to *them* that we have a rebellious daughter who is lazy.
 
To us it looks like a tormented girl. 
 
.....
 
But now we have a he said she said problem. 
 
What we know is the girl feel unsafe, and violated. And that the dad feel annoyed and disgusted.
 
If Don really meant protection, what other alternatives could he have done? And why didn't he. 
 
Why would Don's need for protecting his daughter be a stronger emotion than the violation she feels? 
 
If you ask ""why"" would someone logically feel that way, the stories of their past make a lot more sense. 
 
The story ends with Don being ignorant to the amazing self cleaning abilities most genitals have and Allison having a fucked up sense of beauty, sexuality, self, and looks for control in different unhealthy ways to counteract the subconscious emotions towards genitals and sex. 
 
If I ever need to prove my abuse, I make them question our friendship first (how long have you known me by now), then their knowledge of me (and in that time when did i ever make up a story, for attention, about my family, or in general, when did I want attention?), then finally the trigger that makes me feel like shit. (So you still think that after 20 odd years of little texts like these, little snips at my weight and hair and clothing and style and interests, that I should still smile at her? Death by a million cuts with a smile. Does that seem fair to me? I didn't think you thought so little of me.)

The best advice I can give you is plan for future emergencies but don't live expecting them. Set up today for an easier tomorrow. Sucks to start but makes life so much easier. 
 
Laundry: small loads are easier to manage than big ones, the 6 year old can help folding socks and the 3 year old can help put them away. 
 
Dishes: deal with them when the food is cooking/resting. Nobody likes touching soaked food over night, deal with the grossest things first. 
 
Baths/showers: toys for the children are a must, and if you want them excited, heat up their towels in the dryer for 20ish minutes, then when they are ready to get out they have this amazing warm hug around them. This works for future relationships too. 
 
And introduce yourself and them to meditation. There are children meditations that they can follow. This will give you and them 15-30 minutes of focused quiet time that doesn't feel like torture. 
 
These are skills you would have developed naturally on your course of life. You would have made mistakes and learned from them and refined it. But you don't have that luxury. You have to learn it on the fly and it will be stressful and scary. 
 
You are a good person. Keep that as your moral direction compass. You will make mistakes, anticipate this fact so you don't tear down your self esteem and self worth. No parent is perfect, so don't expect the same from yourself. 
 
Who knows maybe these moments will become amazing memories that the three of you will share together."

You're not worthless. You can't judge something as complex as human worth against a list of adjectives.

You are an amazing person who can't see themselves clearly. Maybe you are seeing yourself through the grey glasses of depression.

We get treated like children or just younger a lot from our stature. I don't look 29 and get treated like I'm 20. Men like my frame, and objectify me because they can literally throw me places. 
 
A lot of my height anger comes from being statically average but treated differently. Some one internalize these and deflect em. I can understand short women wanting a different experience, one where their stature isn't going to be remarked upon. Having a tall giant helps stop the negative self talk and objectification. ""Of course the short is with the tall that makes sense.""
 
Internalized toxic masculinity may also play a role. Are shorter women more traditional than others.

Don't sacrifice your happiness to please someone else. Your happiness matter. Keep the stuffed toys until either you out grow it or someone accepts that they are a part of you. Don't compromise pieces of yourself. Never. Only change habits and behaviours you can't live with.

Don't fall into the ""pleasing other people makes things easier"". Easier for then isn't easier for you. As a basic person you don't mean harm to others, so you never do anything on purpose to upset them. Your existence isn't enough of a reason to treat you with disrespect. If anyone asks you to get rid of your toys for ANY reason, they are setting you up to live by their rules and not yours.

Chances are your siblings feel the same. 
 
Be the person you needed and you will continue to go in the right direction. 
 
When you were 6, what did you want to do the most, was it cake for dinner, or breakfast in front of the TV. Maybe your sis told you what she enjoys doing. And do that with her. Make it healthy, but spend the time bonding with her as much as helping her. 
 
The 3 year old will want to be involved a lot, they don't like playing alone. So think of an easy schedule you can do to entertain them while taking some time for yourself. 
 
Fun things to do with kids: making cookie dough you can eat (you bake the flour for 30ish minutes at 350° let it cool, make your cookies), the older can help you measure the ingredients and the younger can pour them in and all three of you take turns mixing the bowl.
 
Colouring pages are also fun. You can introduce your interests to them. Get some colouring pictures of your favourite gaming characters, and tell the epic battles they go into. You can show them strong women kicking ass while being true to themselves.
 
For bed time stories you can use your old gaming or reading or hangouts. Teach them about you while keeping them safe. Find out their interests and indulge them. 
 
You are old enough to know they are your siblings and not your children. But you are in a tough position. Think about who you want to be to them when they are 15, and in future interactions use that idea as a guide for how to interact with them. 
 
If you feel isolated and alone sometimes, be the person they can talk to. You are paving the path for them, such is the burden of being the first born/oldest. But that means that you can treat them in ways you never were because you have the personal experience already. They are lucky to have you, it is a positive thing. They are not a burden, but children in a tough situation.
