Thank you for your reply, it's interesting and truly insightful to learn more experiences, and no I don't think you are doing the same as my therapist. You are right and I think it's just not a great fit. Thank you once again, it means a lot. I wish you the absolute best you seem like a very sweet person! Thank you."
TalkTherapy,f72xodv,t1_f6zb3rs,1573384041.0,"Hello, thank you so much for this, I really needed it. I guess you are right, some things do require level of trust and understanding that I think we haven't developed yet, and if she had explained it the way you did, I think I wouldn't have as much trouble going back as I am doing now.

Overall I completely agree with you. And again thank you so much for your answer and insight! I hope you have a great day."

TheOA,f5h1tpb,t1_f5eb04w,1572199486.0,"Yeah, I forgot that too! But it doesn't make sense how they would spend far more money on crappy shows/movies and not invest much in the OA. It's also one of the few shows on Netflix that is visually appealing that you forget it's bought by this corporate nonsense. They didn't promote the show at all! I stumbled upon it few years back and was shocked it's owned by Netflix, even people who religiously watch Netflix don't know about the OA... it is such a waste. Anyone at Netflix with functioning braincells would've realized what a stupid decision that was."
TheOA,f5e4tft,t3_dnmwk8,1572164830.0,"Late Capitalism sucks. But also Netflix is a money/views hungry company. And I don't think it can actually have any valid opinion for cutting the OA off other than ""views"". Imagine being so blind to the views and the money that you cut off one if not the only actually brilliant original show on your platform."

First of all, thank you so much for your comment, it means a lot. Thank you for taking the time to share your story and perspective! 

I am so happy that you are getting help and taking care of yourself and mental health. Derealization is horrible and even though I experience it from time to time, I can not even imagine being in the shoes of someone going through it on the daily or for huge periods of time. Just remember that you are strong and you are doing something to make it better, I think that helps to put everything into perspective. 

I will try to validate my feelings I guess and push through. Thank you again and I wish you the best."

You have some Anime written that I never even knew existed so that's really cool!! I will give Death Note another shot and then scream at you, stranger, if I didn't like it. lol. But I do actually like watching mind games related things.... I just happened to love Naruto so much because I just started watching it recently, by recently I mean three years ago .\_. and I haven't finished it yet .\_.

askatherapist,f4gfs83,t1_f4gemf1,1571580650.0,"i'm sorry then you had to call people that didn't know how to help. sometimes we need to help ourselves by ourselves. and it's tough but that's life sometimes. even if someone doesn't say they care for us, we should be able to do so for ourselves. 

your mind is not made up, you care and there is a part of you that wants to live, i just truly hope you listen to that part and stick around... again i hope you find something or see something that is worth staying for."
askatherapist,f4gbbo3,t1_f4g9smi,1571579292.0,"why was everyone so underwhelming? what were you expecting them to say tho? it seems you are leeching on everything so that you leave knowing you did everything when in fact you didn't! i'm here telling you, you can change it around because you can. and i'm sure the people around you too and your wife as well want you around! i really do hope you change your mind. i hope you find something/someone worth staying for. i hope you realize that you are not solving the problem.  i hope you don't go through with. i hope you find the strength you need to stay and make it through.... this is a sign to stay, so please please think it over and stay alive.. it's never too late. you can start from scratch and build a better life. age doesn't matter, there are much older people who start from scratch."
askatherapist,f4g8eag,t1_f4g753f,1571578569.0,"you cannot possibly make such decision on signs or a train ticket. your life is worth more than a train ticket or a sign to determine that. also there isn't such thing as enough time, as long as you're here you have time. and if you're fond of signs take this as one THIS IS A SIGN. why would a stranger comment on your post? please know you are loved and cared for. there are people that won't be able to handle this, your life is not only yours, it belongs to others to, as much as it's hard to grasp or find ease in that but it's the truth. you need to speak with a therapist because you need a clear mindset and a new start. and most importantly need to believe in yourself that you can turn this around. you care, deep inside of you, you care. now you are in a horrible situation but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a solution, it does and you will find it."
askatherapist,f4g60ci,t1_f4g4wqi,1571577915.0,"okay then give yourself a chance, please don't kill yourself. give yourself a chance and i'm sure you will find a way to get through the debt and turn it around! i know now it seems like nothing will be able to help but please give yourself time to find the solution! and the therapists are there just to make you stable enough, not to help you with your debt, they are there to listen and to help you navigate through this with a clear mindset at least. give yourself time!"
askatherapist,f4g2mwn,t3_dkj4n0,1571576890.0,"please don't!!!!!! i don't even know what to say and idk if this will help, life is hard yes but please ending your life is not the solution. it won't solve anything, you will be traumatizing everyone who cares and loves you. please get professional help and talk with a therapist! i swear it helps but you need to understand that ending your life is not the answer. i wasted 10 years of my life depressed and absolutely did nothing but now i'm trying to change that. please please please understand that what you're feeling now won't stay with you forever, but you need to work on that. please stay alive. please seek professional help. please don't kill yourself."

selfimprovement,f4c9lcg,t3_dkaocx,1571526239.0,"I think you don't feel like you are ready enough to make those drastic changes, sometimes it takes time and a little bit of courage and forcing yourself to make those drastic changes, and if you're not ready, that's okay but you will have to accept the consequences.

Try to take each day as it is, push yourself each day, start little until you get comfortable. As little as going to the movies or going to places where people exist and you can smile at anyone or say hi to people to as far as striking up a conversation with a stranger.

The thing is, it will be awkward and weird and scary! So scary, but sometimes we need to do those things for the sake of our lives taking a turn, and us getting better at socializing or even better making close connections. We tend to take those for granted until we understand how important close friendships/relationships are. 

Try each day to push yourself until socializing won't be a thought that would scare you or make you want to stay in bed."
