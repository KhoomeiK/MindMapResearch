That is a very interesting question: I think being a photographer makes it easier for me to translate what I see into flat images so the idea of foreground, background etc is relatively easy for me. Where I have trouble though is orienting the various elements with respect to each other. For instance, in the picture above the pyramids I drew don't really follow perspective properly and the lines are not all parallel (this is one area i hope to improve on). 

&#x200B;

Photography also seems to help understand the interaction of light and shadows, so I find it easy to figure out which shades of color to put where (even though I am definitely a beginner in all other respects). 

&#x200B;

Having said all that, I am not sure how much of these things is a result of my photography practice and how much is simply my innate skill or lack thereof. I am sure other photographers have had other experiences too!

GRE,eoivuyj,t1_eoiv1nr,1558628365.0,That's wonderful and I wish you best of luck.

In terms of plain magnitude of linguistic connection you may be better off Mandarin or Spanish (which might be easier from an English speaking background). As I mentioned, a sad but convenient vestige of colonialism is that English is fairly widely used in India and you can largely get by in business/academic settings without speaking any Indian languages (especially in cities)."

""Vertical Reading

This is probably the hardest of all speed reading techniques. As the name suggests, you should be reading text vertically. Which means, not word by word, but line by line at a time. Your eyeball should move downwards, instead of sideways. It is similar to chunk reading, but here, the chunk is an entire line of text. This is quite an uphill task for a beginner, and only the fastest readers in the world can do it, but you should try and get as close to it as possible.

A good way to start is, by reading newspapers and magazines. In particular, newspapers have narrow columns of text, and each line has around 5-7 words. This is quite an easy task for a beginner, and you should target reading a news item vertically downwards. Magazines are similar to newspapers, and if you can try and get scientific magazines, that’d be great.

Remember, this might seem next to impossible in the beginning, but you are only trying to get better. You may not be able to read long sentences in one second, but even if you can read one short sentence per second, you will skyrocket your reading speed"""
GRE,eoihqle,t3_bs2dqb,1558619966.0,"I think you can definitely find systematic means to answering questions with enough practice. I've noticed different strategies work for different people. For instance, many GRE prep websites recommend 'vertical speed reading' to save time. This absolutely did not work for me and I ended up spending *more* time on the questions trying to reunderstand the passage several times. On the other hand, I *do* find it helpful to note keywords describing the main idea of each paragraph on my scratch paper to help me organize my thoughts and pay attention. 

TL; DR consciously try different strategies across many practice tests and figure out what works for you."

politicalhinduism,eog3tc9,t1_eog31qm,1558550198.0,"This sounds like a conspiracy theory and you're mixing political motivations with religio-cultural ones. I am not denying the existence of Western cultural imperialism but do not think the Hindutva backlash is the correct approach to preserving cultural heritage either. I am more concerned by extremely regressive rhetoric peddled by much of the right wing which in fact continues to oppressive most of the people who would conventionally fall within the fold of the Hindu faith.

Also, thank you for personally attacking me and assuming who I am.  But if we are getting personal I would like to share that I have spent years facing racist discrimination in the west after an upbrining in India and to my surprise found that my greatest supporters were my black, latinx and Muslim friends, not white or Savarna Hindus. Hindutva rhetoric and casteism fractured many friendships and family ties but at least I am glad I can say that I see some amount of good in the world and can stand for myself (and my own Hindu faith) without relying on rhetoric of victimization"
GRE,eog3973,t1_eog296d,1558549853.0,"Try to get in as many practice tests as possible, may be one every two-three days. I found it helpful to keep note of the mistakes I made and systematically work on my weaknesses instead of blindly trying to cover as much material as possible. 

The GRE is an adaptive test, which means your second verbal/quant section will get harder based on how well you did on the first. Because of this it maybe better to take your practice tests on online sites. ETS provides two mocks for free, Kaplan has one free mock as well and I am sure you can find more free/cheap online resources on this thread. 

For quant in particular, when I absolutely didn't get a question I just tried plugging in each of the answer options till something worked. Now this is a time consuming approach so it may make sense to try to speed up on other parts of the section. For instance, figure out when you need the on screen calculator and when doing the math mentally is faster etc. 

Hope this helps!"
politicalhinduism,eog2shg,t1_eog2out,1558549540.0,And you addressed none of my points about the marginalization of other groups in Indian society?

politicalhinduism,eog2out,t1_eog20h4,1558549473.0,"1) EVERY RELIGION IS BASHED AT SOME LEVEL SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD. You can relate a lot of this to the politics of colonization and imperialism, not a vendetta exclusively against the Hindi faith itself. There is no systematic *bashing* of Hinduism at a scale that exceeds any other faith. Muslims are regularized demonized and portrayed as regressive in Bollywood too, case in point Padmavat.

2) that is categorically false. Many Hindu temples are run by their own trusts. And if your qualm is against the Hindu Code Bill, then sure that is a constructive debate that can be had (but I have seen no mention of it on any of these threads)

3) also false + can be countered with allegations that Hindus are trying to do the same with Ghar Wapsi etc. Also the NRC in Assam is actively disenfranchising Muslim people who have inhabited this country for generations

4) school is a place for secular teachings founded in history. The fact that ""our youth have been taken away from their dharmic roots"" is more a failing of a lack of constructive, non-politicized popular discourse surrounding Hinduism.
