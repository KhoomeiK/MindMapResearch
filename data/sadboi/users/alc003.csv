I started with 3x a week, then 2x a week, then once a week, then once every other week, then once a month, then whenever needed. I see my therapist when I need a refresher but she just reinforces the techniques for me. I found it to be really scary to decrease sessions as well and my therapist was also adamant because she believed that she wasn’t meant to be my crutch. She was supposed to teach me so that I could support myself. Now looking back, I’m glad she let me do that. I felt so much more confident after I got through my first few attacks on my own. I felt like I could actually be ok and that hope is so empowering.

Good luck! You can do it!"

Allergies,fmbdtr6,t1_fmaqhip,1585924323.0,"I just spoke to the doctors office (I know, it was quick but I wanted to do it before I forgot again)

They said for their office, they screen every patient that comes in. They don’t see more than 3-5 patients per day. They Lysol and Clorox everything down between patients and at the end of the day. They wear masks. If I get there first thing in the morning, I can get my shot in an exam room that hasn’t had anyone in it and I can wait there or in my car after my shot (20-30 minutes). 

If I do not go at least once every 14 days, they can’t increase/build my dose for obvious safety reasons. No one knows how long we’ll be in this situation so if it’s many months, it could mean I have to start over. 

For symptoms I’ll just experience allergies badly again. For me it’s a bad cough that can flare into an asthma attack. If I need to take extra antihistamines they said I can take a Zyrtec in the morning as well as at night if symptoms are bad. I notice my symptoms start coming back little by little as I get closer to 14 days or longer. 

Hope this helps!!"

I try to do something completely different when I get in grooves like that. For example I’ll get up and walk around or put some things away. It has to take my full mind otherwise I will still subconsciously think about it. If I fully distract myself and I still have symptoms, I’ll use my rescue inhaler. Otherwise 9/10 times I’ll be ok and I’ll know it’s psychosomatic.

However, practicing good hygiene and preventative measures for getting sick in general (whether it’s the flu, covid-19 or a common cold) is probably your best bet. Listening to media and hyping up the situation will not help your body and mind stay calm, so all I’ve been trying to do it keep myself as healthy as possible mentally so I can do the best I can physically. Your body cannot stay healthy when you stress about possibilities alone. Try your best to focus on the probability and maintain rational thinking.

Allergies,fiz8m87,t3_falt3v,1582856734.0,"That’s a lot of Benadryl! I would consult with your primary care physician or an allergist, but you might want to consider a daily antihistamine for control, possibly a nasal spray and nasal cleanser like a netipot, eye drops, and use Benadryl on the days that are worse than others. I’m personally on Zyrtec (available otc or with prescription if it’s cheaper through insurance, also known as cetirizine). I’ve tried xyzal (also available otc or with prescription, also known as levocetirizine) but it didn’t work as well. I used to take Claritin and Allegra as a teenager but not as an adult. There are certain ones that will work better than others, and sometimes they differ in what they will help. For example the Zyrtec helps me most for my allergy cough, which is my main symptom, but Claritin helped me with runny nose and itchy eyes. I also use the Bausch and Lomb allergy eye eye drop and Flonase sensimist. 

Like most drugs, unfortunately you may need to experiment with a few (for a few weeks) to see what works best. If you’re on such a high dose of Benadryl, I’m also not sure if you may need to taper off so I would definitely see a doctor if you can. They can give you insight on what can help! 

Good luck!"
