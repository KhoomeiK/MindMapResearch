I have no right to be mad at them, of course, but it‚Äôs so damn hard to keep in touch since I realized it. I‚Äôm about to ruin my only friendship and I can‚Äôt help it. I feel hella stupid but it just hurts so damn much to know that you‚Äôre a second option for ALL of your friends."

I won‚Äôt know exactly the amount of each one of them, but I started with clonazepam bc I just wanted to sleep. Then buspirona, topiramato, venlafaxina and I believe some other random shit that I found that I honestly can‚Äôt remember. I know it was a lot bc of the amount of packaging."

obeyme,fegxpk9,t1_feeuw23,1579104859.0,"Sureee. So, the devilflower is one of the last items on the devil tree of each card and it‚Äôs SUPER ANNOYING TO GET. When you get it, it changes the layout of the card and it opens up more space on the devil tree so you can power up your cards. But like honestly, the only good reason to get them is to complete the ‚Äúbeginners tasks‚Äù because they don‚Äôt do much. I recommend trying to get the devilflower in N cards, because it‚Äôs much easier. The rarer the card, the harder it‚Äôs to get it."
obeyme,fedeybw,t1_fecn5gl,1579009669.0,I just use the normal cards to get the devilflower bc it‚Äôs much easier than the SSR or UR cards.

obeyme,fe6029t,t1_fe5zw55,1578878765.0,"Oh yea, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I hate when the mC falls in love in seconds. I‚Äôm actually glad that they‚Äôre focusing on the story that‚Äôs actually rather interesting."
obeyme,fe5x65e,t3_enqvly,1578876933.0,"I can‚Äôt decide for shit. I really disliked Mammon in the beginning, but then I started loving him so much. But I always loved Lucifer cuz he is more mature and serious (which is usually the type that I always aim for), who is really trying and he really loves his brothers, he‚Äôs just going through something and doesn‚Äôt know how to show that and I GET IT. 
And the we had that arc with Beel and I just MELTED for him. Everytime I get a message from him I get all excited, and he sometime sends these deep messages that I just think YEA THATS DEEP BRO.

I think that when is time to choose I‚Äôll prob go with Lucifer first SPOILER: (in this last arc when they pranked Lucifer and MC, I already said that I was interested in him, so that‚Äôs done). But if the game is based on routes later, I‚Äôll try Beel and Mammon for sure.

So my ranking is:
1- Lucifer
2- Beel
3- Mammon
4- Satan
5- Levi
6- Asmo (I‚Äôm sorry asmo stans he just annoys me so much I can‚Äôt) 
7 - Belphie (bc we barely have info on him)"
