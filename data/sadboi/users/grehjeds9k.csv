UnresolvedMysteries,fr2pok9,t1_fr2gehg,1589841536.0,She was likely manic. Manic people do crazy irrational shit. I'm bipolar and I probably would have jumped in a water tank at my most manic because you feel invincible.
UnresolvedMysteries,fr2p6j2,t1_fr0t3bg,1589841270.0,I have bipolar too and am known to try run away when manic or commit suicide when depressed. I honestly don't know what would happen if I went missing involuntarily.

bipolar,fqxzj9t,t3_gldnr6,1589740215.0,As a bipolar I I don't really get the mania where you can function. My mania hospitalises me - I enjoy the initial high and I do miss that like hell but it's not worth the cycle of meds and hospital and involuntary treatment. Otherwise my life before lithium was a misery.

Not a single person in her journey has helped her but Jaclyn and her friends. Other people who used her for their videos and for money like Shane and kati can go to hell.
bipolar,fqpybxy,t3_gk278x,1589556198.0,Yes but before my first manic phase. You need some kind of hypomania or mania to be diagnosed with bipolar.

EUGENIACOONEY,fqbc2gx,t1_fqaetd9,1589234249.0,"True, I can see that happening. The lawyer was there for Shanes video. I'm not sure why kati would continue to defend her position and glaze over reality as she has done in her following videos and podcasts though."
EUGENIACOONEY,fqbbx1k,t1_fqb0ulj,1589234174.0,I hope they have. I'd like to do that myself but have no idea how to. From what I've heard her say it doesn't sound like she actually sees many clients anymore.
EUGENIACOONEY,fq9pbm9,t1_fq9omg6,1589204179.0,"Genuinely that's all she had to say. She shirked responsibility with 'I'm not EC'S therapist, that was not my role' and then proceeded to say people might be angry with her because they are 'ignorant' and 'uneducated about therapy'. The woman is genuinely deluded. She's dangerous."
EUGENIACOONEY,fq9dnyz,t3_ghj8jz,1589194796.0,At this point I don't even feel like she deserves that kind of attention.
EUGENIACOONEY,fq9dh28,t3_ghhvol,1589194600.0,"What bugged me so much out of this whole fiasco was Kati Morton and her blatant hypocrisy. We have receipts of her practically telling Jaclyn to get EC out the house and 5150 her, they had phone calls etx, and this woman has the audacity to make a video about ECs traumatising experience of being 5150d and her friends 'bamboozling' her. Never once did she take any responsibility. I watched a podcast of hers and her only defence was 'I'm not EC's therapist, she's not my patient, and I'm not going to rise to Internet trolls who want to share details about their friends mental illness'.

This woman had the gall to call Jaclyn a troll!!! When she fuckin orchestrated the whole thing! I don't get how she isnt being criticised by EC the same way Jaclyn is because she is just as if not more culpable."

I was only allowed out I think once or twice for that whole 3 months. I tried to jump off a 50ft road structure because I thought I was invincible and would bounce like a ball. I attacked police, got arrested, slept an hour a night, didn't eat properly for two months. In the hospital I was restrained and injected with medication every day.

BipolarReddit,fq1r8ti,t3_gesrew,1589048287.0,Abilify is better for weight. That said I had extreme akathisia on it.

BipolarReddit,fq1qpgj,t3_gfeffa,1589048136.0,Zyprexa made me gain weight very quickly and feel like a zombie. I find it's only good for stopping mania. That's just my experience. I wouldn't recommend it personally. I didn't feel human.
BipolarReddit,fq1qi4x,t3_gfuxdt,1589048078.0,"I did the opposite. Seroquel gave me weight gain, acne and cognitive slowness. It also kept me in a depressed state. 

Lithium has been a godsend for me. I feel normal again. I have no mania or depression and very little side effects. However I'm type 1, and I can see that lithium might not be helpful for all types of bipolar... It's a powerful salt and works best preventing mania in my experience."

BipolarReddit,fpcwpu7,t3_gc3i88,1588514663.0,My friend with bpd died recently. It's the diagnosis with a high mortality rate. The suicide option is always there but you must keep pushing through and accepting yourself as you are and doing whatever the hell you can to stay alive because I can tell you how devastating it is when suicide happens.
BipolarReddit,fpcweeo,t3_gcee4t,1588514447.0,Bipolar is only a part of us. It's important not to pathologise the whole personality or being.
bipolar1,fpchykl,t3_gckf6g,1588501277.0,Honestly don't do it. From my experience it will probably make you manic or psychotic. It's not worth the fallout. Just a few hours of feeling good is not worth a major episode of mental illness that can derail your life.
EUGENIACOONEY,fpchroe,t3_gcjds9,1588501159.0,In the UK we involuntarily section people like this.
