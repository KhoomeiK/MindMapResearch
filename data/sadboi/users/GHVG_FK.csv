EmpireDidNothingWrong,fr44qea,t3_gmdalb,1589875748.0,"Micro Machines Man here to tell you about the genuine original marvelous majestic Micro Machines Street Zapper colossal collection. 
Make these cars zoom and vroom, veer and steer, jump and bump, flip and fly. 
Micro Machines Man used to own a 1965 Mustang convertible, but his wickedly witch defying wife took it and everything he owned in a shockingly sadistic divorce proceeding that left yours truly emasculated - devoid of testicles, nada, nothing but an endless empty scrotum swinging, swaying between his legs like a portentous pendulum tick-tock ticking away the fleeting remains of yesterday’s youth, vim and vigor. 
Yes, the sea cow from the black hole of despair married Micro Machines Man, not for the everlasting promise of eternal tongue-tickling, but for an amorphous amore that only a sick sad succubus could inflict on a rapidly balding butthead with poor potential prospects. I’ll never see my kids again! 
Tonight’s the night of nights when a ridged Remington rifle barrel gets frenetically fellated and brain matter goes splitter splatter and the big blanket of dim, dark, darkness gives cold comfort to a broken bitter bastard! 
One more pointless product you can’t take with you to the grave. By Galoob!"

Also, it isn’t so much constant high-downs. More something like normal-down at some point.

Like, I did/do it to feel at least something. I usually used razor blades as they are easy to obtain/clean/hide. Also I thought the scars looked cool (I still hid them). So for me, the grill one sounds... like an alternative.  
*However* I doubt it will be under the 5 bucks I need for blades. And it’s not like I (or anyone I’ve talked to) cared about the long term consequences too much when they were in a crisis (where you usually buy and/or use the blades). 

Other people I’ve met said they did it to see themself bleeding. They didn’t care about the pain. Others did it to relief stress. 

I also remember that the alternatives to self harm (""skills"" as we called them) we were offered in a psychiatric clinic included chilli but it just isn’t the same...  
I don’t think they were actually used more than once or twice by us before realizing how less it makes us feel better (or something)...

My point is: as long as the access to/usage of actual self harming methods like razor blades will be easier and cheaper (and I’m afraid they always will be)... I don’t see this *really* working.

So take the stuff I write as it is: something a stranger on the internet wrote 

However: the ups (or energy/drive) I got from various substances and some manic episodes were really shallow. Now for the drug part, if it’s just for a few hours while tripping, that’s neat. But the ones I got from manic episodes were rather exhausting. SSRIs (in my experience) are a bit like being surrounded by cotton. So you’re more numb emotionally and physically (again, just my experience). My GF at that time described it as being a Zoloft Zombie. 

Having a lot of energy during this isn’t something I imagine very pleasurable (especially in the long run). I remember that during of my episodes I just wished for it to be over because your body wants to do stuff, and part of your brain does, but you have nothing really to do. I couldn’t concentrate for shit so productive stuff was out of range. I cleaned my room for a bit and it was over *rather* soon but that’s not something I would want on a regular basis. 

In fact I imagine it quite dangerous if they last longer than the SSRIs. When I got down with the dosage suicidal thoughts became heavier and more frequent in the evening. Having a lot of energy during those... eh

There are other antidepressants that give you energy I think, but I didn’t try those out. If you are interested you should ask your psychiatrist"
