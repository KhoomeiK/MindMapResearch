mexicanfood,fo8lwcu,t1_fo7zkeg,1587599126.0,"As mentioned by OP in another comment, I also use Simply Mama Cooks' recipe for flour tortillas.  I'm a bit sceptical on the baking powder though.  I used it for the first time tonight and didn't find it made much of a difference.  I just can't see Mexican Grandma using baking powder much but maybe I'm wrong.

When I started I tried both flour and corn tortillas and at the time I wasn't a fan of corn ones because they seemed too dry.  Well, I was following the Maseca directions which is 2 cups of flour, 1.5 cups of water.  I was also overcooking them and pressing them too thin.

It wasn't until last summer, after eating at one of the better local spots and chatting with them about it, that I used higher hydration, thicker tortilllas, and care not to cook them too long.  The difference is night and day!

So basically I use almost as much water as masa, give it time to hydrate (20-60 minutes?), and make nice thick tortillas.  For each cup of corn flour I'll use maybe 0.8-0.9 cups of water.  You have to get a feel for it, just do it a few times.

Corn tortillas are also so much easier and quicker to make and have become my goto.

Cheers and good luck."

ramen,f7x3heb,t3_dxww65,1574045252.0,"I made this in the spirit of /u/Ramen_Lord's new wave shoyu.  I actually used a Costco cooked chicken carcass, it had plenty of meat left and lots of gelatin.  Cooked 30 mins in the instant pot then boiled on the stove to emulsify things.  

It ended up very rich, more so than a lot of tonkotsu I've had.  Using a tablespoon of aroma oil mostly comprised of black garlic oil may have had something to do with that!

I made the noodles litteraly starting 2 hours before serving. 38% hydration, 1% egg white powder, 1.2% baked soda, 1.5% vital wheat gluten (Hard bread flour, 1% salt).  They turned out great considering the short turnaround.  That's also why I didn't do any eggs.

The meat is a soy braised chicken breast.  Also, green onions are my favourite!

fermentation,erimr9t,t1_erhx1kw,1560901706.0,"Good question.  What I usually do is put my mixing bowl on a scale, zero it, add my veggies or whatever I'm fermenting, and record the weight. Then calculate my salt weight for the veggies and add it, mixing it up. That will start pulling liquid from he veggies and begin to dissolve the salt.  When you're ready you can transfer it to a mason jar or whatever you're fermenting in, making sure to get all the liquid and salt crystals.  Don't worry too much about the solid salt here, it will be ok to dissolve later.

&#x200B;

In a pot I'll make more brine than I think I need, lets say it's 1 litre, and for example add 30g of salt to that for a 3% solution.  I'll usually heat it up to dissolve the salt or heat a portion of the water to dissolve it then top it off with more cool water.  You don't want to be adding hot brine to your ferment as you'll end up killing most of your bacteria.

&#x200B;

Once the brine is cool you can use it to top off your ferment container.  If you do it this way it doesn't matter how much of it you use since each portion will be the same % salt!

&#x200B;

Having said all that you could indeed just add the veggies, water, then salt into your jar, cap, shake.  Should be just fine! Esp if you use a finer salt that's easier to dissolve (vs rock salt)."
fermentation,erhhrdm,t1_erhhe7n,1560875627.0,"That's how I calculate all my brine.  That way you know your final product is that % salt.  If you just do % salt by the water weight then the product will vary wildly depending on what you ferment - large chunks of things (these fries) vs finer more airy cuts... think about how much water will fill the space around the thing fermenting.

&#x200B;

Cheers."
fermentation,erh8iem,t1_erh0q51,1560869735.0,IMO % salt by total weight is the right way to calculate it!
