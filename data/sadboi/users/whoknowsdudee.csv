And people who r already filled with anxiety use it as a way to get validation and such, when in reality it does the opposite. U post something and it just makes ur entire day worse cuz ur just worried about the amount of likes ur getting.

Because I also do a similar thing, where when walking on a sidewalk, I need to step each foot in the square, then be on the next square, otherwise I get anxiety. And I know this is because of OCD.

Another OCD thing I do is whenever I walk up or down a staircase, I need to count them, and start with my left foot

I’m lucky to have people around me that I can just message or call just to mess with them when I’m bored, and they’ve been a lot of help to me the last few months. so maybe if it’s possible find 1 or 2 people u can do this with, whether it’s a cousin or a family friend that he comfortable with and talk to them.

People in they’re teen years have MASSIVE egos and refuse to let their walls down to anyone. Whereas people like us with anxiety, prefer to let our walls down and be close with people. 

All through highschool I had pretty much no close friends(I talked to people, but rarely  outside of school) 

I think not having an ego is a big part of maturing, and since we grow up without one we mature mentally much quicker and struggle to fit in.

I’m 19 now and am getting to the point where I feel I can finally talk to people my own age because people have matured, and aren’t so quick to judge. 

I work a retail job and definitely get that uneasy feeling around people younger, because everything feels so much more serious around them. But people the same age or older I feel fine. There’s just so much more pressure with young people to find their niche group they got into, but when u get older those niches sort of mesh together more and people don’t care what ur like.

It wouldve been different if they had been acting strange and then just one day didnt want to talk to me. But it went from them asking me to hang out, to them trying to avoid me in a matter of 48 hours, no warning, no signs of reason.

My rational side, and the part of me that sees the good in the situation, says that maybe since she knew I liked her, and she got into a relationship then she didnt want to lead me on, and wanted space. Respectable. But if that were the case, a simple text couldve saved me all this time of thinking.

The other side says its a problem with me, and nothing feels worse than feeling like u make someone uncomfortable just by liking them.

I also want to help so fucking bad... I see them putting themselves into toxic relationships/situations and it fucking breaks me down. Because I see this broken person, really struggling, that i care about, and theres nothing i can do.

I feel so stupid for feeling so strongly, and I have plenty of reason to move on, but i just cant, I honestly cant put into words the way i feel

Anxiety,eu71p8n,t1_eu62gg8,1563515145.0,"Thank you

I'll clarify that i am (M) and the other is (F)

But basically to make a long and very complicated story short, when we started talking she was in a very bad mental state, and going through some drama with some friends, which we both work with. So she turned to me for comfort during that time, and it all eventually lead to her sharing a lot about her own mental problems, a lot of which I also deal with. I felt like we were super close, and really wanted to be there for them and help them, and be a friend for them at that time, because they told me they felt alone. It lead to her breaking down and me being there to comfort her.

Right at this time is where things changed and i dont know why. When she broke down, we had planned to hang out the following week when we were both free. I obviously texted them the next few days and asked them how they were feeling, the first time it sort of just got brushed off, and the second they told me to stop asking because they were getting annoyed. When it came to the day we were supposed to hang out they ghosted me, and i found out they got back with their ex later on...

I asked what happened and got a shitty excuse, and then later got brushed off when trying to hang out again.

I took this as a hint that they stopped wanting to hang out with me, so for my own sanity, i removed them on social medias. (have no idea if they noticed)

Its been 2 months since then and every day it gets further the more scared i get, and I hope some day i get to talk to them again and feel better about things.

I try to rationalise the whole thing and think what i couldve done. I was nothing but nice and trying to help them out. But i cant help but think that they just think im gross or something and if it is me i want to know what i may have done so i can change it.

I even feel sort of bad for sharing this story because it is a little personal, but idk how else to get my mind off of it"

Like who caused it or what caused it?

I would try to make up the friendship if possible, even if it’s just u guys saying u forgive each other, then go ur separate ways, and maybe talk to each other every once in a while and see where things go. 

I think it’s worth it to try an make it up because otherwise u carry a burden of this person the rest of ur life, every time u see a picture of them or hear their name it will hurt. I say this from experience"
Anxiety,eu3juev,t3_celev6,1563416635.0,"U make perfect sense, I know exactly what ur feeling and I feel it constantly.

You’ll spend HOURS worrying about something or overthinking a scenario, and it crushes u inside, but the second I try to explain it to someone, u think they’ll just make fun of u for it, because it’s such a non issue.

I often second guess myself with things I worry about, but u also need to realize that that’s what anxiety is. Hopefully u can find someone that u r comfortable with that understands what ur feeling and can talk to them"
