Yeah pig has been my favourite animal since forever and they are so cute and even smarter than dogs plus saving one is even better.

Thank you for the kind words ‚ô• I think or hope my friend is just didn't experience having a pet before so she doesn't understand what it feels like, but I'm sure not to go to her when my other baby goes. Thank you same here. Hope you feel better, its hard to lose a friend especially one like that.

Thank you for your kind words and I really hope you feel better.
I am thinking of trying to get a animal like a pig from the animal killing factory's when I'm older as I am sick of seeing any animal suffer or a animal from a shelter.

And it was a rat, I didn't want to write it in the post as a lot of people are disgusted by rats or I even had a friend tell me ""it's just a rat"" so I didn't want to go into too much detail haha. 

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/IGmbdkA here is a picture of the two. Alex the darker one passed. Stefan is still kicking though :)

Do you have any pics too?"

I will be sure to let you know how he is in a week or two, thank you again for everything.

Sorry this happened to you, it is absolutely awful that animals cannot live as long as us seeing as they are so special and even better than most people.
I'm glad you atleast had someone so special in your life and I hope that you can look back and remember all the times she was there for you.
You can always get another best friend, you won't replace her definitely not but atleast you will have another cutie by your side, maybe you can even find a friend from the shelter that needs you as much as you need them.
I hope you feel better and are able to look past this awful death and realise how wonderful it was, the memories of her that is.

I am considering it now tbh, he looks and is acting okay but this isn't even the first 24 hours. I am trying to find a rat in his age as if I find a baby I think it would be more difficult? And the younger one would have to experience loss as well.
I am looking rats 2 years old for adoption, hopefully something comes around for Stefan.

Thank you for the kind words too ‚ô• I did have a few pets before so I know that they don't live forever but it's still as sad to see them die."

But yeah thank you those activities sound good. I will try anything at this point.
He does play with me so I just need something to keep him entertained when I can't let him out."
