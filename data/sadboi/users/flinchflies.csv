Check this video out for insight on the chemical roots of different types of depression. At 8:06 Sapolsky begins talking about psychomotor retardation with regard to depression. There are many types and causes of depression. Sapolsky explains each type, including depression caused by insufficient dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin. Depression that affects the ability or will to move is partly caused by a deficiency in one of the three particular neurochemicals."

They will shake hands and high five each other behind closed doors. It's one of the only things they can agree on. More control.

CRedit,fodsiai,t3_g6tbvj,1587689309.0,"Remove yourself as an AU and get MORE credit cards. Avoid cards with annual fees. Look for cards with 0% APR for 12 months and try to hit the spending cap, but repay the debt as soon as the following billing cycle begins. Do not do this if you don't have the money to repay the debt, you will screw your credit up. Only use as much credit as you have expendable cash available. You're not going to get good credit without proving your creditworthiness. You want a large pool of credit to mitigate the ups and downs of your credit. The longer you have a large pool of credit through many credit lines the better your credit will be. My Transunion credit was floating around 750 for two years before it hit 798 a few months ago. I started establishing my credit four years ago, so it doesn't take too long."

They're no different than their counterparts, ""religious values"" just keep them from outwardly supporting many of the things that the left promotes. Ironically, they're afraid to live honest lives for fear of family and community retribution. Gotta love Christian Conservatism."
