Yeah, I agree, but if the story mode doesn't need online support, which I doubt it, but if it doesn't need online then it might be kinda worth it, but then again we don't have many details and now's not the time like you said"

NinjalaTheGame,fozzpu1,t1_fozjk60,1588199777.0,"Like there wasn't a great explanation on how to do it and I just got ""This is what it is, but not how to do it"", so a little better mechanics on that and explanation and also my A.I. didn't attack, but maybe I missed it? Either way, yeah"
NinjalaTheGame,foz09rl,t3_ga8s08,1588182441.0,"I got to play one match on the city level, not quite sure what it's called but there is WAY more wall running and like the game says, ""parkour"" required to traverse it, so I'm not to worried about that part, there might just be different maps that encourage different movement options, and I'm willing to bet a few maps will have some unique gimmicks that set them apart form the others. And I agree, even though the gameplay was fun at first ( I got one game in the first session and played for all of the third, slept through the second), I get why you'd be concerned about content. I hope there are some other modes or little side missions, maybe even something like capture the flag, but you never know, they might add some crazy stuff in the future. I haven't kept up with the social media so correct me if I'm wrong, but they might add some new weapons or game modes as free dlc or maybe even with the final launch, but right now we don't need that, just a few fixes on the base game. Woo sorry that's so long, just my hot take and thanks for reading

Edit: Yeah there are going to be more weapons I just committed major dumbth, now I'm only worried about the game modes"
NinjalaTheGame,foyz864,t3_gaaux0,1588181909.0,"I agree with the parry system, before I realized what exactly it was I just spammed all directions on the left c-stick annd I'd say I won like 70% of the parries, sometimes letting me win the game and I don't really like that, I think they should change it up a little. Also I think I skipped the tutorial and that may effect it, but still I agree, it should be a little more skill based."

NinjalaTheGame,foyvoq6,t3_gabr1n,1588180038.0,"So I was lucky enough to play for the whole beta session this morning and maybe it was the fact that we were all new, but the game was super fun and really easy to pick up. It did take a basic understanding of the controls but after that it was smooth sailing. Like u/Evil_phd said, character creation  is super fun and off the bat you have quite a few different options. 

The combat is really fun too, I found that once you find the weapon that suits you (mine was the spear/lance one) it's not too difficult off a combat system, and can be quite enjoyable when you get K.O.'s. There aren't too many moves so it doesn't get over complicated, but there may be a few times where you spam buttons.

I only played on two maps, one being the basic arena that's just a square with a few other things, and right at the end I played on the city map shown in the trailer. At first it was a little confusing but by the middle of the match I had the map figured out enough to know where some things are, so that's not something to worry about. Oh and I didn't suffer from any lag either, when I did play it was SUPER smooth and fun, can't stress that enough.

My final thing is that maybe a slightly better tutorial, but I think I accident;y skipped it, so most likely it's fine. But overall for a free-to-play game, and just a game in general, it's one of my favourites. I didn't notice any stores where you can buy anything, so most likely it'll be only for cosmetics and not pay-to-win like other games. Sorry it was so much, but overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I was left wanting more, and I can't wait for May 27th!"
