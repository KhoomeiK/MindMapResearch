EMDR,fhnn9v1,t3_f3yvc0,1581729185.0,"Not quite the same situation, since I have a few memories of early neglect, but it definitely started well before those memories.

It's tricky not knowing where it all started, but I've had some success just working through the earliest memories/feelings of abandonment I can remember in EMDR (I've had about 10 sessions at this point)."
NarcissisticAbuse,favxxwr,t1_faqhe9i,1576363458.0,"Oh yeah, I know what you mean. I looked back and realized I only dated narcs. Had to seriously reconsider my tastes and make sure I could recognize the signs before I jumped into something new."
NarcissisticAbuse,faqg9pw,t3_eafpaj,1576302627.0,"This book was a huge help for me, but it seems like you have a lot more awareness about what's going on than I did at the time - I didn't even realize I had been abused until I read it.

It can definitely help understand their mindset and strategies, and give a basic blueprint for recovery (although I'd recommend adding some books on recovering from trauma in general).

I'm so sorry you're going through this... Getting and staying away was the hardest part for me. Wishing you luck :)"
CPTSD,fapx5u3,t3_eaa55x,1576294701.0,Congrats!! Blocking off a big chunk of time to play video games is one of my favorite forms of self-care

cptsdcreatives,f9c2q99,t3_e4hk63,1575218744.0,You did it! Congrats!!
ptsd,f5icy1p,t3_dnxrfu,1572213276.0,"Yup! I get digestive issues and chest pains. It gets recommended a lot around here, but the book The Body Keeps the Score helped me understand the intense physical ways trauma affects your body."
cptsdcreatives,f5h13hz,t3_dnwrg9,1572199314.0,"Hell yeah! Fwiw, I really enjoy seeing your progress. Lots of respect for anyone that can do something creative when just getting through the day is a struggle."
ptsd,f5gzhxu,t3_dnwbs7,1572198851.0,"Yeah, I was so confused why I was stressed out dating people who actually treated me well. I think I just got used to kindness being used as a manipulation tactic that it would make me hypervigilant.

That and if you have low self-esteem it's easy to read people who hurt you as just being more honest. If you feel on some level that your past traumas were your own fault (they're not), it can feel like kind people are just putting on a show."
abusiveparents,f5cqgws,t1_f5bx56q,1572139181.0,"Something that kept me from getting help for a long time was that I didn't know what abuse looked like. I can't say for sure about your situation, but if you're living in constant fear of your parents it sounds likely. There are some good guides for spotting the signs of it online. I can't seem to find the one I was looking for, but the ""Types"" section on Wikipedia here could be a good start: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse

Also, if you need to talk about physical abuse but are worried about upsetting people here, you can start your post or title with a content warning like (cw: physical abuse). That will let people avoid it if they need to."
ptsd,f5bwyaf,t3_dnk0bt,1572126940.0,"I used to use a mood tracker as a flashback tracker - recording time of day, severity, and what I was doing. I found it useful, because I wasn't really sure what my triggers were. I started noticing patterns, which allowed me to start brainstorming where it could have come from. Eventually I felt I had enough information and stopped though."
abusiveparents,f5bl281,t3_dniuud,1572122829.0,"You're not a screw up - you made a totally normal and common mistake. You seem to be aware that the way your parents treat you is abusive (given the subreddit), but I really want to stress that what they're doing is not okay.

It's easy to internalize the blame and say ""if only I was a better daughter they wouldn't treat me this way"", but that's not how it's supposed to work. You shouldn't need to constantly manage your parents emotions - it may be a necessary survival tactic until you can move out, but it's not your fault or responsibility that they behave this way. You deserve love and compassion even when you make mistakes."
CPTSD,f1q2eyx,t3_dabzui,1569692278.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you, dude. For what it's worth, CPTSD spaces seem to be pretty trans-friendly. Even if our trauma isn't gender related, we know how damaging it is to have an identity forced on you by the people that were supposed to love you unconditionally."
CPTSD,f1ljsjy,t3_d9p8y8,1569556731.0,Holy shit yeah
CPTSD,f0zqv42,t3_d7b3ol,1569101098.0,"I go through this a lot too. I'm lucky to be dating someone that I can trust, but it took years of making gambles being honest about my feelings to get here: tell her a little bit, see how she reacts, try to give her tips on how to comfort me when I'm not feeling well.

I spent so much time feeling like an awful boyfriend, because I could be really inconsistent about a lot of things. I was scared of how she would react if I told her what was really going on in my head. Having someone I can tell everything to has been a huge step forward for me in reducing my emotional alienation. It's a big weight to carry alone.

Just remember, this isn't your fault. You didn't ask for this - you're just managing the best you can with an awful situation. Maybe that can make you difficult to be around, and maybe it's too much to deal with for some people, but that's okay. Terrible people exist, normal people who just can't handle the emotional work exist, but people with really big hearts exist too.

(Sidenote: I listen to the song ""A Pearl"" by Mitski a lot when I'm feeling like this. You might find the lyrics relatable.)"
NarcissisticAbuse,eyusebu,t3_cyvzew,1567470896.0,">I know her trying to beg me back is all smoke and mirrors, she’s telling  me exactly what I want to hear but I don’t believe it, this has  happened before.

I'm glad you know that this is all part of the game. It's a huge step. Granted, knowing this doesn't make the pain go away.

You're only one week into NC, and the early part is excruciating. Narcs can make you feel like you've lost the only person that really got you, and it's easy to overlook all sorts of cruelty and abuse just to keep them around. With time the illusion will soften, and you'll be able to look over your relationship with a clearer head, but right now it sucks.

It took me a while to realize there's not really a downside to NC (assuming it's a situation where that's possible): if they're a reasonable person they'll understand your need for boundaries, and if they're not you made the right call cutting them out of your life.

I'm not sure I would have listened to any of this when I was in your state, but at any rate I hope you're doing okay."
