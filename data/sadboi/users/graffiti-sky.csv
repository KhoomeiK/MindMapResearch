He is so laid back, affectionate, curious, smart, and quirky. Bubs' verbal skills are exploding and he's getting to the ""never shuts up"" phase.

They're always so appreciative for some bread, peanut butter, and bananas. $5 is such a small amount for a couple days worth of food for them. I think that's part of why they tend to hang out there. Free quarters and cheap groceries.

Over the years I also often see the same folk at the same intersections, watching them look more and more rough breaks my heart. We can't save everyone though. All we can do is try to be a good human when presented with a scenario like that. Many homeless folk are mentally ill. I as a schizophrenic bipolar could have easily ended up where they are. It was only through the kindness and determination of others that kept me off the streets.

It's hard to tell a true person in need from a scammer sometimes. However, I see that as their karma and not mine. If I ""help"" one of those folk, then how they spend the money is on them. I can't pretend to know, all I can do is what feels right in that moment."

Everything from the typical avoiding situations, people and places that remind you of your trauma, to literally looking at something completely benign that will remind me of something from my past. A broom, a coffee mug, a type of flower, the way someone uses their body language. A simple memory triggers other memories as well. 

For example, hubs asked me to scoot down the bed some so that we could cuddle (I always sleep up against the headboard). I then told him why: I learned to sleep scrunched up in the far corner of my bed with my back to the room. That way the damage was minimized when my stepfather decided to wake me with a rain of blows.

Hubs just moved a butter knife on the table (we're eating breakfast) and a flash of memory went through my head. Stepdad used to smack us with the handle of a heavy duty butter knife if we chewed too loud or put our elbows on the table. It doesn't usually cripple me, but it's ALWAYS there. I live in both the real world and the world of my trauma at the same time. It's not ""just"" that I get flashbacks sometimes or have trouble talking about topics, mood issues, etc. It's always here.

I was forced to stand outside in my underwear during bad thunderstorms.


My hell didn't stop until I moved out at 19.


The most twisted part (to me) is that he started bullying and then regularly abusing my younger brother for doing normal kid stuff. Any time he messed up even the least bit (eating a ton of crackers and clogging the toilet come immediately to mind as examples). He even literally cracked lol bros head against a counter and a cinder block wall (2 separate occasions). He was also denied medical care during these and other instances.


I'm now disabled from severe ptsd and mental/physical illnesses that can be traced back to those monsters that called themselves parents. My brother is incredibly fucked up and will never be able to hold a ""real"" job or even be a fully functional adult. He struggles just to survive.
