Kayaking,fr3v8cj,t3_gmf4i0,1589867217.0,I was a plastic welder fabricator for 10 years. Ive seen lots of people say it looks easy. They try it and the rod sticks to the material. See that was easy! Shortly after when its under stress it collapses in a dramatic fashion. You can peel it off. You need to v out the material with a grinder or v-ing tool and make sure you get enough penetration. Youd start the weld an inch before the crack and finish an inch after. Usually a good sign of penetration is a small bead eather side of the weld itself where the base material has been displaced. Then id v out the sides of the root weld and put a weld either side of that one. Id advise another method for somebody that has no experience plastic welding or get some scrap material and practise. Maybe you can get a repair kit. Maybe you could apoxy some material over it but id check if its compatible first. Some chemicals make certain plastics crack. See if theres a repair shop im not sure if they exist. Also it could be u v damaged if its cracked.

AskRedditAfterDark,fr3l29l,t3_gmat41,1589859756.0,"I havent told many people this. I kind of repress the memory sometimes. I see quite a lot of stories on here that i think might be a made up fantasy but believe me this really happened and although it was hot, it wasnt all  good because of the risks involved.

I was 17 and a virgin. My dads then gf (not my mother obvs) was hot as fuck. She was about 5 ft 2 with long blonde hair and aged about 28 but looked more like 24. She was super attractive and flirty. She had a cute face a little bit similar to bree olson when she first started porn, if not a bit cuter honestly. She used tanning beds so had a nice tan and deep brown eyes.. She was quite petite with a nice ass and tits. A good size with an overall slim figure . Me being 17, a virgin and her being hot, i couldn't help but have a crush on her and i used to think about her all the time. Id always have fantasies about her.. She always flirted with me. She told me to change my tshirt one time and she said i looked good Another time she was drunk and kept asking me if I'd fuck her. I didn't answer because my dad was sat next to her laughing. I should have said no but couldnt. But she looked into my eyes when she asked it and she had a real sexy smile. I never thought I'd ever have a chance with her at all. Shes my dads gf, 28 and hot as fuck. I was a shy, slim 17 yr old virgin.

One night we had a party and were all drunk. She always got me new drinks and encouraged me to get drunk with them. We genuinely got on with eachother and had a good laugh. We used to get drunk and play poker and monopy. She was wearing those nice tight black leggings that stuck to her shapely ass and legs, ugg boots and a tight white vest top that clung to her small/medium sized but perfectly shaped tits. My dad was in the upstairs living room with the others. I grabbed another beer from the kitchen. We were having a great night. I was new to drinking and was absolutely wasted but feeling euphoric as it was new and exciting to me. I went to the computer in the downstairs living room to put some of my music on and she came in and just sat on my knee. She acted normal and picked a song from itunes. And i wasn't sure what to do. Oh my fucking god. My stomach turned. She leaned back, arching her lower back and put her head next to mine. My heart was racing and my dick was growing and getting rock hard on her sexy ass. Her ass and hips felt warm and squidgy. I gave them a little squeeze. She stood up whilst sticking her ass out and said she'd get us a drink. 

As i sat on the sofa shocked thinking what the fuck that was hot. She came over and sat on my left. She shoved up to me real close so that her sexy leg pushed against mine.. Before i knew it we were kissing. It was so fucking hot. We were a perfect match with kissing. Both going playfully slow but quite deep with the tongues just how i like it. We were both breathing heavily and obviously turned on. I knew it was wrong but i couldn't control myself. I put my hand on her sexy stomach and slid it down quickly onto her pussy. It was soaking wet! My fingers just slipped in. Oh fuck. She was rubbing my dick up and down through my jeans. My dick was tingling so much, i just wanted to eat her out and fuck her real hard but there was nothing i could do about it because my dad was just upstairs. I heard people coming down the stairs and she shot up. I adjusted my dick so it tucked behind the waist band of my jeans. I was shaking like fuck. Filled with adrenaline. She said shhh! Calm down or he'll know. My dads friends said bye and left. They said night and went up to bed. I went to bed too. Still shaking with excitement the first thing i did was masturbate. Almost as soon as i touched it i fucking exploded all over myself. I carried on and did it again and even maybe another time after that. I went to the bathroom to clean up kind of hoping she was there. She wasn't. I tried to sleep but found it hard. Honestly i was a bit stressed. For years I'd been trying to build a relationship with my dad and now it was at risk. But i just couldn't help it. In the morning i woke up to the sound of foot steps in creaky wooden floor boards. My door opened, she came into my room and dived onto my air bed and laid next to me. I put my hand onto her stomach. But she just waited for me to do something. I felt like she wanted me to make a move but being a nervous virgin and stuck in an awesome but terrible situation i didn't know what to do. Then i heard my dad get up. She got up and walked into the bathroom and it sounded like she cried. She was very flirty in the morning like my dad went to the bathroom, she would hand me something and stroke my hand. And give me that smile that made me surge with testosterone. 

There were times after that that we nearly fucked when my dad wasnt there. I could go into detail but i dont have a spare hour to write about it right now. Honestly i was nervous as hell and wasn't drunk. Even if we did do it my pull out game wouldnt be very stong and id have jizzed prematurely for sure.. Unsurprisingly they split up some months later. I think shed fucked somebody else."

PublicFreakout,fq1aelm,t1_fpzrqtx,1589043783.0,There was a bully at my school. I was fed up of his shit so i grabbed his expensive hugo boss jumper while he was wearing it and just ran dragging him across the room. He had one arm pit that was super baggy and he just said shit my jumper and backed down.

uklandlords,fpwkjz8,t1_fpwd5bk,1588965077.0,"You know its not exploiting people. I rent from somebody. Theres a lot less risk and stress involved when you rent from somebody. You also dont have to save 20k to put down on a deposit for a mortgage so its good for people who are just starting out. I'd advise somebody to save and then move out of their parents when they can buy but that takes a lot of time and some people don't have the luxury of doing that. They aren't less wealthy than me. A lot of landlords are wealthy but a lot aren't too. Its their choice to rent just like its mine to rent. I'm a renter and i rent out. It wasn't covered by insurance because it was caused by vermin and that's not covered on my insurance for some reason. 

I never said anything about envy by the way. I'm saying that as somebody who rents a house to and from somebody else, I'm not rich, i help them when possible, i get anything repaired that they want. Its a responsibility, it can be stressful and it can be a money pit. It can also earn you a lot of money but its not all sunshine and rainbows. I'm a normal person but you seem to have something against anybody that rents a house out because its like stealing from the poor. Is it their choice to buy a house just like it is mine? Yep. I'm not rich. I come from a poor family. I'm the one that decided i wouldn't buy anything for myself except food and it was the cheapest food i could buy. I did that for about 8 years. Other people can do that too but they choose not to because its shit.

You're talking as if people that rent houses are a victim. I do it myself.  You don't need a credit history, you dont need saving and you don't need to buy or repair the house or appliances. You can also leave after a year if you dont like the area without the stress of selling and buying a house and remortgaging or if you split up with a partner.people do have a choice you know. You're just an angry muppet that probably mad because they have to pay rent and your landlords an asshole.

I pay rent too and it goes to the mortgage. Its not free to live anywhere. You either pay rent then they pay their mortgage or you pay your own mortgage. The difference is to get a mortgage you need a good credit report and a deposit. It takes time to get that and some people have a bad credit report and would rather buy nice things. That's fair enough but its ultimately your choice.

""It's exploitation of people less wealthy than you"" 

So you're saying its wrong to sell things because it's classed as exploiting people poorer than you. That's not what exploiting is and like i said I'm not rich and i don't even have a job because i got laid off.

Some people think that they shouldn't have to pay anything and think that the government should give them everything. They don't have much of anything and just envy people that have. You've got to work for shit. Complaining about people that have something wont get you something. If you don't like renting then don't do it."
uklandlords,fpw9etv,t1_fpv77d1,1588959518.0,"Did I ever say I'm not getting equity in the long run? Why else would i do it? Because its not all fucking fun and games. I'm not doing it for fun.. Equity in the LONG RUN. Not now. I get a really small profit from the rent thats saved for repairs and it doesnt always cover them. I do that so the people living there are paying a fair price. I've still got to do all the shit everybody else does like buy food, pay rent and bills, lose jobs and then pay £2000 now again again to get stuff repaired. Its not £200 here and there once or twice a year. Sometimes something bad happens and it needs fixing. Sometimes it doesn't.

And then there are risks like we're going to find out soon when we smash into a recession. My fixed rate will run out then and my renewal rate will no doubt be sky high. But that's alright because I'm a ""fucking moron"" and I'm ""paying myself that money"" I'm just like everybody else. 

I'm not a victim, I'm not wealthy and I treat the tenants with respect. 

People like you have a default hostility towards people that rent houses out. Why is that? Had some bad experiences or something?"
kelowna,fpw41q0,t1_fpvrmha,1588956887.0,"I'm talking about social gatherings of up to 50 people not reopening. Things should reopen with social distancing rules in place. A lot of the time in sports you cant social distance. Sports are a luxury that put a lot of people in the same place at once. Sports are not a necessity unlike the economy. I'm seeing a lot of people having parties and shit as if there isn't a pandemic on going with a highly contagious virus. If its just about slowing the spread then you wouldn't mind getting it? As long as a hospital can accommodate you? Say that to the two people i know that have died.
We need effective medications at least before people resume the luxury of sports. They're just for fun and a great way to spread this virus. That's my opinion only. You can say and do as you like. You can see what's happened in other countries and also with the 1918 flu pandemic. Rules were relaxed in the summer, people lost their anxieties and started socialising. That lead it to come back even worse near the autumn."

I wake up and see stuff in my room like illuminated patterns on the walls for like 2 seconds. Sometimes when I'm sleeping i can see the dreams or visions really clearly. Open my eyes they go, close them again they come back. I like it."

kelowna,fptkvck,t3_gfcey3,1588893150.0,Even if its allowed it doesn't mean you should do it. Its inevitable that its going to come back. Its still there but the reported cases have dropped because of social distancing. And when it does come back its usually under the radar meaning that you and your family could very well get it whilst still being allowed. My neighbours are having a party. Its too early. People just can't go without social interactions. Its not hard. Look at history and other countries. Singapore had it well under control and relaxed their rules. Now its bad again.

Kids at my school used to ask to go to the toilet, get outside and light a cigarette and leave the school. Or they would go rip a bong and come back. But that doesn't mean good kids should have to be punished for it. If they wanna go smoke their education away then you cant stop them."
