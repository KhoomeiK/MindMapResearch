Enjoy yourself, but dont just break hearts. Have sex, and be safe while doing so. Thats how i see it. However, no matter how old, cheating on the person you actually love is almost unforgivable"

AskTeenGirls,fal5zaf,t1_fakyb0l,1576178971.0,I don't. I look at music for what it is. You completely disregarded my point. I might like his old music but i don't like him as a person. Besides you seem to be very ignorant about the reason actual hip_hop heads or myself don't like him. He's a douche. Did you read what i said?
AskTeenGirls,fakplwn,t1_fakgfrx,1576171052.0,"Do you have basic knowledge of judging anything. Besides i pirate my music, i only buy cd from artist i support. So basically me liking chick-fil means i hate gay people? No it just means i like their food. I would not pay for a concert from an artist i can't relate or I just dont find that enjoyable anymore, i dont like drake anymore because he doesn't do anything for hip-hop and he's just making radio hits, as a person hes is real shitty because of other stuff like disrespecting Rihanna, being a fucking deadbeat dad, and well liking young girls. Kanye is a good example he disrespected the fuck out of taylor swift, and then came back with one of the best albums from this decade. Yes you can separate the art from the artist, you are just not trying hard enough."

Take a look at slayer for example these mfs really be out here worshipping the devil, but i just look at the fact that what they are making is good music on my opinion.
