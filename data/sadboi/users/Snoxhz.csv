MouseReview,fmit0ti,t3_ehhfho,1586116319.0,no ergo mice like ec. how come?
MousepadReview,flszbhl,t1_flsz76y,1585454742.0,and you mentioned overwatch look up prosettings a huge majority of pros go with the g640 so cop that
MousepadReview,flsz76y,t3_fqm1av,1585454649.0,I switched from console to and my best advise would be not to even think about the g-sr. If you look closely rarely pros use it and it makes aiming such a pain because of the known for static friction. I was fooled by this it takes much force to even much the mouse and in my experience it takes away the learning curve from aiming itself because your mousepad is doing the stopping for you. Steelseries and logitech are great unlikely to offend anyone. Feels like the majoirity of good high quality pads
AskReddit,flswgil,t3_fqq4tl,1585452572.0,the number of people saying myself is quite astonishing

MousepadReview,fkpl18o,t1_fkpkprk,1584412688.0,"Is this a common problem with the g640, yh and how long did yours last before becoming very slow. If they are that good it could be a esay cop because 15 euros every 6 months for a replacement is affordable. I have a qck and want to have something a bit faster."
MousepadReview,fkpklp5,t1_fkpkbui,1584412392.0,So after the wear down will it return to the feeling of the black normal one? Or is this a misconception of coating that its basically a normal g640 with a faster tempoarly surface to it

MouseReview,fivi9f1,t3_fa0jhk,1582760818.0,logitech g440 if you want maximum speed. medium so stick to a higher sens
depression,fcpezgv,t3_eif6dh,1577861091.0,i cant recall exactly what book it was but certainly a good one from stephen king. In that he describes a flight and suddenly the passenger seats are not filled with humans anymore but their clothes and valuables like arm watches. But it was only the half the other half was still alive and wonders. Well one thing they notice right away with their first bite in a sandwich. It tastes dull not good at all and old even tho it looks the same as before the flight and this situation. Turns out they were in a time speeding black hole. And what do you think did i try to tell you by that. This time shift ( speeding up time) made everything so dull and empty ( like the sandwich) and this is exactly the same with emotions. They wont dissapear but i strongly believe and stephen king also that they will continue so long on that this emotions just tastes bitter empty dull and useless and eventually we will shut it off. give it time. i got that story from my mom she also said that time can actually heal the most nerve recking wounds.

depression,eusw0lb,t3_ch5k91,1564014680.0,"Dunno how to help but i think most problems are deeply rooted in unsatisfaction or unfullfillment in life. You gotta be ready when u find that person in life that will get you out of that horror trip of depression and you have to believe! Let me tell you, one day knowing that you believed in yourself has paid off its pay day. At the end of the day we act like our ancestors, the god damn animal like drive and instincts that keep us alive to this day. We have it deeply rooted in our brain. Its like every damn fullfilling life. Get yourself the love of your life so that evolutions purpose has been fullfilled resulting in yours and mines wish come true. Cuz why not. Whats the happiest thing one can imagine? Its to have someone you can share paths and get old with."
