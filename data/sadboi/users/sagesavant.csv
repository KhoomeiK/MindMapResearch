gayyoungold,f9kr0ri,t3_e5hcmw,1575406132.0,"Depending on what you consider older would depend on your approach. My attitude for everything would be to show them rather than explain. Dude, you don't need to justify yourself to anyone. If dating older is your thing go for it. However, I'd also suggest not rushing into anything. At 18 there are alot of guys who'd love nothing more than a piece of little boy meat. Always ask yourself what the older guy's intentions are before going for it."

LukeMianiYouTube,f8cgup3,t1_f8cg38r,1574459942.0,It definitely helps thank you. Back in 2018 I went ahead and bought a IPad Pro set (almost $2000 Canadian) only to find out I can’t do much with it. I intend to keep using it as it’s amazing for everything else. Have you used Coda by Panic? I’m considering using it.

gayyoungold,f42ij4t,t3_dj0xjo,1571332117.0,"Your sexuality doesn’t change whether you have someone else’s approval but you’re definitely in a pickle. You didn’t call her your ‘ex’; she’s still your wife; at least in your head. You do owe her the  respect and continued love to be honest with her. Coming out isn’t only about YOU coming out. It’s about giving people the opportunity to catch up to what you’ve always known but too scared to admit. You have lived with this secret for a really long time but when you do come out to her, its for the first time. She needs time. She will be upset. She needs your support too. The boyfriend, as cute, young and perky that he is, YOU. OWE. IT. TO. YOUR. WIFE! She married you t’il death do us part. You married her until you were ready to come out.  It’s not about having a boyfriend right now, its about supporting your family while they support you. You can’t erase the past and what you’ve said to convince anyone. Don’t expect your wife and kids to be board just because you came out of the closet and have a ‘young’ ‘boy’friend. 

I speak from experience; I married my high school sweet heart. A girl I grew up with and eventually out grew. I married her to keep up appearances. I’m 42 now and from the ages of 15 to 24 I was with her.  I’ve been out of the closet for 18 years. Guilt is there, it’ll always be. 18 years of growing up. 18 years to grow a set."

gayyoungold,f1mi2qg,t3_d9na05,1569594412.0,"I’m in my 40s now and thought I’d share my thoughts. I have always bounced between age; sometimes younger or much older but never the same age. It has a lot to do with my comfort in intergenerational relationships. I wouldn’t say there’s a ‘look’ or sexual interest in one or the other but about connection. Sometimes a man in his early 20s is far more interesting, intelligent and comfortable expressing his thoughts. At the same time, there are older men who are boys at heart with boyish charm. Sexually, a man in his late 40s or early 50s, with a life of experience and well toned abs is far sexier than a boy with muscle. He’s mastered his charm and has learned the balance between wisdom and compassion. There are also men in this age group who are dumb as fuck with the Peter Pan syndrome; they don’t interest me. At the opposite end of the spectrum, a young men with his smooth skin, bright eyes and perky ass along with his young charm and h ‘old soul’ composer, is hot AF. I have friends (both straight and gay) who are in intergenerational relationships, despite their ups and downs they have been together than most of my friends who are in same-age relationships. Sometimes there is a balance when the scales have been tipped.  I make no apologizes for my attraction to intergenerational relationships and to be honest, this is the first time I’ve ever spoken about it.  Good luck, Be Proud and listen to your heart."
