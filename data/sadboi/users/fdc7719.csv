It's a knee-jerk reaction. That said, I personally have issues with China in how they treat their people, their concentration camps, their ""re-education camps,"" etc. So on one hand, I do agree with fuck China based on how they treat their people. The problem is, it's not the people that is the problem. They are victims of their government. The government controls what they see and hear, so the citizens that support it are effectively brainwashed by propaganda from birth. They basically don't know any better and are punished harshly if they so much as begin to question anything or find a way to expose themselves to other ideas. I can't blame the populous for their shit leadership.

Pressuring them financially via diplomatic relations is one way to try to force change, but they put out as much disinformation publicly as they do to their own citizens. They are large enough to self-sustain if they really want. I don't know what the answer is.

Bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. would be great and all, but people are paid so shitty on average that without sweeping mandatory minimum wage increases to a living wage, we won't be able to afford our own products. The upper class will - they've been grifting since the beginning of capitalism. Unions are getting fucked over hard in red states, so even if you unionize, it doesn't carry a lot of weight. Unions were made for the exact reasons that we're seeing unfold in places like Amazon. Now the workforce will be saturated with the unemployed who will be desperate for work. Employers can simply low-ball an offer because something is better than nothing when you're piss broke. They'll use you up, burn you out to the point of quitting or you'll be to goddamn sick to keep working and the company will simply replace you with the next desperate person.

We need actual leadership for the fucking people. I'm not going to say both political parties are equivelent though both are guilty of perpetuating this bullshit. One side is very brazen in policed that have led to this.

Personally, I don't plan on retiring in the U.S. It's just not financially possible. Depending on how things turn out this November will determine the timeline of moving away.

An escharotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat full-thickness (third-degree) circumferential burns. In full-thickness burns, both the epidermis and the dermis are destroyed along with sensory nerves in the dermis. The tough leathery tissue remaining after a full-thickness burn has been termed eschar. Following a full-thickness burn, as the underlying tissues are rehydrated, they become constricted due to the eschar's loss of elasticity, leading to impaired circulation distal to the wound. An escharotomy can be performed as a prophylactic measure as well as to release pressure, facilitate circulation and combat burn-induced compartment syndrome.

TrueOffMyChest,fqppse2,t1_fqpkvv8,1589551673.0,"Somewhat. I think a lot has to do with money management as well. I'm not making a blanket statement there, either. Some people make every penny count. I know that once I was out on my own, if I somehow came to have an extra $1,000, it objectively was a lot compared to what I had to work with normally. In my shortsightedness, $300 for something I wanted seemed ok. Maybe I did put the other $700 toward bills or necessities. The thing is, days or weeks later, I'd come to really need that $300 I pissed away. What you're describing isn't just poor people, but people across the board financially. In the US, there are many, many people who live beyond their means. 

There are a lot of factors in what keeps poor or a lot of people in general financially struggling. If they receive government subsidies, there are often limits as to how much income they can have before benefits are reduced significantly, if not taken away entirely. The problem there is that the amount reduced or that's taken away isn't allowing the person to be in a better financial position to finally start to have upward financial mobility. Lenders also really take advantage of those with lower income. Yes, the risk for defaulting on a loan is statistically higher. Regardless of your credit history, even with a spotless history, you'll still end up paying more interest than someone with higher income. One thing lenders came up with to exploit people is adjustable rate interest. Even if nothing at all changes in your life, your interest rate can jump up significantly.

Getting quality things like a car can also be difficult. If you buy a used car with 90,000 miles on it, you're still paying a high interest rate on a loan likely spread from 5-6 years to try to keep the payment down. Many states allow your credit score to be factored into your insurance rate. If you're financing a vehicle you're required to carry full coverage on the vehicle which is incredibly expensive. If the car has a major mechanical issue, there's rarely a way to afford it, so the option is to trade it in and roll the rest of the debt from the last vehicle into the next.

Another factor is that if you're fortunate enough to have a job that offers health insurance and you elect to take it, the deductibles are often incredibly high. Though it's been 10 years since I last had high deductible health insurance, for just my wife and I the deductible was $10,000 out of pocket before insurance would pay anything. Usually with plans like that prescription coverage is kind of crappy. There are usually three tiers of prescription coverage. What I typically see with a lot of plans is something along the lines of $15, $40 and $60 or more. $15 gets you most generics that have been around for a while or are cheap to manufacture. $40 for the more expensive generics and maybe some under patent still. $60 for the more expensive medications or those under patent. Those costs go against the deductible in many cases. If you get sick - it will cost you. As such, people don't go to the doctor or hospital until they are extremely ill or injured.

Banks also have overage charges. I think the bank we go to charges something like $35 *per overdraft*. That means if you overdraw your account and you bought a snack for $1 on your debit card and bought $10 in gas, you've just racked up $70 in overages which will come out of your next deposit. The common scenario here is automatic payments. Debits are processed before deposits.

Sorry for the long response. Having been at both ends of the spectrum it's really illuminating as to how much better you're treated by default if you have high income. My wife and I didn't have great credit when we decided to try to buy a home. Our income alone was enough for the bank to lend us the money anyway. With good credit our new vehicles with insurance costs less than we were paying for our old, unreliable vehicles. It's really night and day.

TL;DR: It's expensive to be poor in the US. Higher interest rates, predatory lending, crappy health insurance and unrealistic government assistance rules make it incredibly difficult to move upward financially. Some people do piss away money, but that's really not the case for the majority of poor people."

Having been very poor at a couple of points in my life, you go with the lowest cost. Not because you don't care, but you don't have any other realistic option. Principles are the same, but you need food on the table and roof over your head. The same with people who work for Amazon - it may be the only job they can get, or it may pay slightly better than the next place they could have gotten into. Again - you do what you have to do to bring in the most.

Last year I left my high paying job for a $30k pay cut. The hours and demands were destroying my health. I'm still quite comfortable, but again - I stepped back my income to something comfortable with a pay cut being more than millions of people make in a year. The system isn't fair to anyone. I've worked hard to get where I am, but I know a lot of people far less fortunate that have worked equally hard and simply haven't been given a chance or there are no opportunities in their community and relocating isn't feasible because that costs money as well."

insanepeoplefacebook,fqnv2my,t1_fqnu8t4,1589501975.0,"It’s for mutual protection. The N95 masks you get at a hardware store have an exhalation valve in the front. Medical grade ones don’t. 

In the rare instance that I leave home right now I wear an N95. If I’m outside and others are around I have a cloth mask that has a filter in it. It’s not as safe, but I stay away from people. If I have anything even resembling symptoms, I stay isolated. I had Adnovirus and viral pneumonia starting at the end of March. I finally started getting better a week ago. 

If you’re a rational person and take adequate precautions, based on what we currently know your risk shouldn’t be all that high. Running around with no mask or a mask tucked under your nose isn’t safe for you or others. It’s likely most people will contract it. My wife is an ICU nurse that treated COVID patients for a few weeks. It’s horrific when it’s bad. I don’t think people appreciate how badly it ravishes your organs."

It's not so much of going to a mental health professional rather than setting down some guidelines and following them. The basics are outlined in the bullet points [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/in-depth/insomnia-treatment/art-20046677). If you're interested in the documentation that covers general principles that I have, please DM me and I can upload them and send you a link.

Hopefully OP will respond and give specific info on your question."

He had to know they guy's camera was on as he said it, too. I'm in no way defending the cop whatsoever, but really appreciate the fact that he owned it when so often we see cops who are silent or somehow blame a person when it's clearly the cop's fuckup. Though I'm mad that he hit the dude due to negligence, I'm glad he admitted it so that he'll own the responsibility of whatever repercussions come of it. And I'm glad that aside from minor injuries and the bike being fucked up that the dude was OK."

worldnews,fqm1qkv,t1_fqkq1wt,1589469996.0,"As someone who's done permutations programmatically, it'd be pretty easy to take a few lists of names, be it first and last, or first names in one list and last names in another, then a list of street names, cities and ZIP codes from a database and randomly match them to come up with fictitious names and addresses. Of course, that would be irresponsible, so that list would need to be run against some sort of online database to make sure the street address numbers aren't valid so no mistakes could be made. Theoretically, of course. Just thinking out loud of how terrible it would be if someone were to do this awful, awful thing."

I'd later meet me wife who's from Rhode Island and we lived there together for a few years before moving here. My parents aren't getting any younger, so this seems to be the place to be. I truly miss the coast and all of the natural beauty of New England, but also love the amount of nature here in Ann Arbor. If it were any of the other places in the midwest I'm familiar with I'm not certain I would have been as comfortable with the move here. I really do like the city and the people, weirdos included."

I honestly believe that the parallels of how things got to the point of Nazi Germany was along the same lines. Do I believe it’ll get that far? No. But the steady normalization of dehumanizing opponents has led to a lot of the rhetoric I’ve been hearing in recent years. Especially since 2008.
