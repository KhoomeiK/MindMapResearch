A couple of non prescription things that you can try...

Talk about it:  Doesn't have to be a professional, a friend or a family member that you feel comfortable with and who you know will listen. Saying things out loud and answering questions about it can help you process feelings. Hearing other perspectives can sometimes help you adjust your own. 

Meditation: Even if you ""aren't into shit like that"" give it a try, there's a million free apps. Now, getting anything from what they say is a bonus, the thing I found useful is that it's always a soothing sound and voice and if you focus on what you are hearing it keeps your mind occupied.

Journaling: it sounds like a lot of work, but you can cheat. Voice to text! When you are having bad anxiety, journal it. Later, when you're calm you can revisit the topic.

Playlist: Make a playlist of songs that make you feel good. Only songs you never skip. Songs you know the words to. Listen to the playlist when you're anxious, sing along with it, in your head or out loud.

Sensory Countdown:  

5: Acknowledge FIVE things you see around you. It could be a pen, a spot on the ceiling, anything in your surroundings.

4: Acknowledge FOUR things you can touch around you. It could be your hair, a pillow, or the ground under your feet. 

3: Acknowledge THREE things you hear. This could be any external sound. If you can hear your belly rumbling that counts! Focus on things you can hear outside of your body.

2: Acknowledge TWO things you can smell. Maybe you are in your office and smell pencil, or maybe you are in your bedroom and smell a pillow. If you need to take a brief walk to find a scent you could smell soap in your bathroom, or nature outside.

1: Acknowledge ONE thing you can taste. What does the inside of your mouth taste like—gum, coffee, or the sandwich from lunch?"

AskReddit,fod00bw,t3_g6ule3,1587678128.0,"It's really hard. I have vaginal issues that make sex painful more often than not. Over time it's turned into a mental issue too. If I'm horny I end up thinking ""but am I horny enough to risk pain"" and as time has passed I decide ""no"" more and more and so my husband asks less and less because the constant rejection is hard on him.  Because he's extra lucky, I also have a small mouth, so I can't give him a very long BJ without my jaw cramping up. 

I am 100% okay with him masturbating, watching porn, whatever. I've thought about whether I could be okay with having an ""open"" relationship and letting him have no strings attached sex with a fuck buddy ( definitely would not be okay with him having sex with lots of other people) but I just can't do it. Plus he needs emotional connection with his sex, so I don't think he would enjoy no strings and I don't want him getting into an emotional relationship with someone else.

It's ruining our marriage and we've been together for 13 years. About 5 years ago, he started bettering himself, as in learning how to cook, asking me to show him how I managed our finances stuff like that. He confided in me about a year later that he had been preparing himself to live on his own.

See, for him sex and intimacy are tied really tightly together. So, while I get my emotional needs met without sex, he does not.

In an effort to make things better, I tried changing my mental health meds in case they were decreasing my libido, but that failed on an epic level and I've been off work on long term disability for almost a year trying to get back on track.

I've seen a gynecologist and have creams to help with external vaginal pain and I might have surgery to fix a minor prolapse to try and help with internal discomfort and we have cock rings designed to keep him from going to deep.

The reason for so much detail in this is to say... It can be a *big fucking deal* so if it's a relatively new relationship, the party with the higher sex drive needs to think long and hard about whether or not it's something they can deal with long term. You can't assume someone is going to change, you need to go into a relationship from a position of ""even if nothing ever changes I'll be happy with this person long term""

TL:DR It can be hard."

Anxiety,focssbn,t3_g6ulfl,1587675365.0,"My comment history would probably show me saying this a lot, but here goes...

If you haven't, you should talk to a Dr about how your feeling. They can help you identify if it's anxiety vs OCD etc and help you to figure out if it can be managed on your own or if you might need to get a prescription to help.

Needing to go on medication doesn't necessarily mean you have to be on them forever either. Some people are able to take medication for a while to help them dig out of that hole to get back to some place where they can manage on their own. But sometimes if you're too far down in that hole you just cannot get out on your own. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with asking for help."

From the American Optometric website:

Having 20/20 vision does not necessarily mean you have perfect vision. 20/20 vision only indicates the sharpness or clarity of vision at a distance. Other important vision skills, including peripheral awareness or side vision, eye coordination, depth perception, focusing ability and color vision, contribute to your overall visual ability.

Some people can see well at a distance but are unable to bring nearer objects into focus. This condition can be caused by hyperopia (farsightedness) or presbyopia (loss of focusing ability). Others can see items that are close but cannot see those far away. This condition may be caused by myopia (nearsightedness)."

Well for external contamination, literally anything can have toxins put on it while it's on a shelf.
For a syringe, and sticking to Tylenol, where I live the bottle is in a box. You would have to steam open the box, take the top off the bottle then use the syringe. Here's the problem. The first and easiest to get around would be the gob of cotton in the mouth of the bottle. Even a relatively small needle like the type diabetics use is going to leave a hole in the seal that a lot of people would likely notice. If I opened a bottle of Tylenol and the pills seemed moist, or had an unusual looking powder residue... no way in hell I'm taking those pills.
Someone might argue that most people probably don't look that closely at the foil seal, but in my experience they are so damn hard to get off the bottle that you spend more time than you would like to staring at that little thing while you're fighting with it.

However the odds of them being transmitted via saliva is pretty low. So I'm still going to take my chances with spit over cyanide."

AmItheAsshole,f0vmgmw,t3_d6uauu,1568986195.0,"ESH - Even if she didn't place importance on birthdays in the past, she made it pretty clear that this birthday was actually important to her, so you can't really feign ignorance. Assuming you have a relationship with her, you should have been there.

She was pretty crappy for not letting you celebrate your birthday growing up and it was definitely a dick move to bitch about it to your friends and family and FB."

AskReddit,eyoilr4,t3_cxyhfy,1567277641.0,"It can happen really fast, it doesn't take years to create an addiction it can happen in days with some substances. I had to be on Hydromorphone for pain for 4 weeks, it took me six weeks to wean back off. If I went down by more than a half a milligram a week oh, I would get full blown withdrawals, shaking sweating pain. I wanted to be off it and had the motivation to be off it and no desire to remain on it, but my family doesn't really have the addictive gene. Hey give me a whole new understanding of what it must be like for somebody who really gets mentally addicted as well as physically, if you love the way you feel when you're on it, and getting off it is that hard, I can see why people wouldn't bother."
