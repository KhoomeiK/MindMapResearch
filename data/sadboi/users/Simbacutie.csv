I feel the body memories haunt me. And so do the flashbacks. I actually had repressed memories come to me 2 years ago and haven’t left since. I do feel disabled primarily because I’ve become completely non sexual. It’s affecting my life in the sense also that I’ve gained weight but somewhere I feel I don’t want to lose it because it will remind me of what I looked like when I was young. Doing a squat changes my body position and triggers me. So I feel so very stuck."

then later he said i suspect bpd. biatch. i don't have any symptoms of bpd except for emotional sensitivity but that's also cos ive got ptsd and adhd so Im very low frustration tolerence.

Now I can’t access my record and I can’t speak to anyone because everyone has been told not to talk to me.

The cherry on top? My ex psychologist went into my file and placed a false diagnoses of alcohol abuse. I truly believe the alcohol thing was done in error due to lack of care but still, you’re supposed to be on top of your game.

Thereafter now they’re asking me to do an alcohol test, which I’ve never done in my life. They went off a statement that they took at intake asking me do you drink I said yes. This was 4 years ago. And the diagnoses is this year.

Then she kept saying I was making philosophical questions. No biatch. I’m about to make it to law school and I was throwing logic in your face which you refuse to accept.

Do I have the right to file a formal complaint even though she just wants to mediate?

I’m shocked Ocr did not do anything in your case.

They are not stating they will not release my records based on a false allegation, I wrote a letter to a retiring county supervisor to report the county attorney and I’m literally regretting it at the moment. I fear if this would backlash.

They update their records every 4 months if you have a case worker. I had one but he was providing therapy. I discontinued service with him and was no longer under his care.

6 months later he went into my file, conducted an update to my record by doing a psychiatric revaluation, answers questions on my behalf and assigns an alcohol disorder.

His explanation? 4 years ago at intake they asked do you drink? I said yes, which I state every doc I go to because I want to make sure they inform me not to drink with xyz meds if required. This happened this year 

4 years later, the letter they sent me is asking for an alcohol blood test, which I’ve never been asked for in my life.

I don’t have this disorder and never have.

Thank you for sharing.

I guess I need to practice boundary setting. It’s hard for me to see clearly when someone is manipulating me though.

The other thing is like you, I also work in corporate and have lost jobs cos I get triggered but my siblings who I no longer speak to always told me to bite my tongue and just take it. Like every corporate job there will be some a hole. My issue is I’m not able to take it because a) I start getting triggered and b) it builds in me and I internalize it vs my siblings who can let it slide. I don’t know how to let things slide and if I keep leaving every job then I won’t have a job, like now.

The other thing that bothered me about this t is that she thought it was okay to exert control by abusing men, like you said. I just don’t think abusing others or dominating them is the way to cope. I liked your thoughts on that.

I guess I’m also confused when and when not to set a boundary? 

Like how does one set boundaries with a boss? 

For me whenever I’ve reacted like at this mental health place I would write them letters. They hated it because a) they had to place them in my records and everyone has access to that and b) they would get scared that they did something wrong probably because they didn’t know who was writing them. They didn’t expect me to write them because for 3 years I didn’t write and they all of a sudden thought I had a lawyer or something. No one writes to them except for me lol

... and I have no idea where I was going with this. Thanks adhd!

Edit: oh yeah I remembered. So then basically they retaliated against me. And someone mocked me the other day saying you used to write letters to them remember? Now they wrote a letter to you closing your case.

I was like wtf."
