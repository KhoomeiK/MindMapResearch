unpopularopinion,fq7026r,t3_gh31hq,1589140041.0,"I agree that men should be more caring towards each other, but that would be a GREAT effort to overcome societally and I’d go as far to say biologically. You know the drill, your paternal figures saying “suck it up” and what not, or some cultures who have coming of age. Testosterone might play a part in it? Not sure. 

It’s not that men aren’t aware of it, it’s just that it’s been programmed and engrained into their being to be more stoic, strong, and the rock of a family or relationship. 

My family and friends are greatly caring towards each other. My family is close. My friends and I say we love each other and have overcome obstacles to both prove it and it’s a wonderful feeling.
