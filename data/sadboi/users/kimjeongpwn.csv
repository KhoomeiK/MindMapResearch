How soon can one start contributing to open source? That's the dilemma/catch-22 situation I seem to have. I want to start being exposed to projects and doing/creating stuff as I think that is the best way to learn (and learn fast). But without sufficient knowledge in syntax and the different functions etc, how the language works, i wouldn't be able to contribute much, if anything at all. Doing 'guided' exercises from online courses and from books don't pose too much of a challenge, and practicing katas (for e.g. code wars) are more akin to solving math problems in the sense that it's not really 'linked' to how things work in a real programming situation (at least I think that way, correct me if I'm wrong).

Write a function that plays the 24 game."
learnpython,fnk3npe,t3_g07wjj,1587014013.0,"Hello, I am newbie in both programming and Python. I am subscribed to a Daily Coding Interview Question newsletter, and one of the problems that was tagged as \[Easy\] is to program the math game '24'. When I looked at the question, I have no idea how this would be considered easy. I have learned while and for loops, if, elif, else, variables, data types, lists & dictionaries (but not very familiar with these yet), and I can't quite imagine how I would be able to code something like that, since there are so many possibilities that could happen. How would I know where to put the parentheses or operators? The only thing I was thinking of was to use a for loop, but even then, how would I ensure all the possible combinations would occur to figure out if it would return a value of 24?

I don't need an answer - pretty sure I can find it on stackoverflow. I just need some guidance to the thought process of making this happen, since at this point to me, it seems impossible, and yet it is tagged as an \[Easy\] interview question.

Thank you."
