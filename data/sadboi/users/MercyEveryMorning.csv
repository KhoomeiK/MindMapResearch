You could call the clinic but they will give you zero information unless he signed a form allowing his information to be released to you and even then it wouldn‚Äôt be over the phone.

BorderlinePDisorder,f9yq926,t3_e7ew8s,1575732314.0,"Thanks for posting!! I cannot understand any professional reasoning putting a 3 year old on Ritalin. If anything I would be the most concerned of how that affected your development and mental growth through very important years. I‚Äôve never heard anyone professional or otherwise say ADHD ‚Äúturns‚Äù into anything else, especially Borderline. I understand you can have both ADHD and borderline but each is it‚Äôs on diagnosis. They don‚Äôt turn into something different. Have you went over the deciding factors of being diagnosed with Borderline with a professional? I would start there. Mood disorders are very tricky to diagnose sometimes. You really have to have someone skilled that has been in the industry. I am now on a combination of drugs that seem to work wonders for my BPD. Prozac, Lexapro, Buspar, Tegretol and vyvanse. It can take awhile to find the right medicine and can be very discouraging. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to get a great doctor who is ready to ride it out with you until you find the right combination. 
Good for you tapering down. It can be very frustrating getting on and off meds. Withdrawal sucks. I‚Äôm still learning everyday about what works and doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a journey that is very personal to each of us. I wish you all the best in getting stable so you can enjoy life! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
