If it makes you feel better, he is not going outside as much (for business, he still walks for pleasure if he wants!), so I don‚Äôt clean him as much. A wet wipe on his feet is all he needs (with a cat friendly wipe of course)

Thanks for getting it. You have a great day too!

Fun fact: for some disabled folks like me, cleaning a litter box is easier than taking a dog for a walk. He is legit the best thing to ever happen to me! If anyone is reading this, look into therapy/service cats! They are so intelligent and loving!"
tuckedinkitties,foqvl3w,t1_foqszlc,1588001603.0,"He‚Äôs a service cat. Or therapy rather. A step above emotional support but not certified as service. We went through the training, for both dog and cat. (A cat must behave when being carried. A dog must behave on a leash. He is a leash kitty.) He is cleaned regularly because he goes everywhere with me and sleeps in bed with me. He helps wake me up (via jumping on my chest) so I don‚Äôt pee on myself in my sleep or keeps me awake (via nips) if I have to take an Uber home. I have a neurological condition that sometimes I just sleep for days at a time. Thankfully, it is in remission. I‚Äôm even able to work now! (Tango does not go to work)

So why do I bath him? I don‚Äôt want his little dirty white feet in bed with me. He‚Äôs been bathed since he was a little baby, he‚Äôs used to it. He doesn‚Äôt mind. He gets blow dried so moisture doesn‚Äôt get stuck under his fur. He gets wrapped up in a blanket afterwards and fed treats. 

Our life is a little odd but it works and we‚Äôre both happy.

Edit: maybe don‚Äôt assume a person‚Äôs love for their animal based on a pic alone? Not everyone is going to want to explain their life to someone in the internet."
