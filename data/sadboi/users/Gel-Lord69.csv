If this isn’t rude, it seems that before your fight, you and your brother were very close. Maybe it’s worth getting back in touch ? Siblings are important relationships and if you were so close before (and I could take a while, or maybe no time at all) but it could be worth talking to your brother again. Also music has always been a huge part of my family too except I was the opposite in the sense that it was always forced on me but not something I wanted to do. But there are always other things too! I’m an artist so maybe you could try drawing ? Idk. I’m just spitballing but what I really want to say is things get better. It’s a dark scary world but somewhere you’ll see or hear or do something that will make you happy. And this will happen again and again and things will get better. Sending love from Australia <3"
