AmItheAsshole,fdea3o2,t3_eksd4l,1578334517.0,"NTA - this is identity theft. My mother did this to me at your age with an electric bill and a cell phone, and I didn't find out until I discovered in on my credit report when I tried to apply for an apartment. Shut the account down and be completely upfront about the situation to the electric company. Do not pay the debt, at all, it could cause serious complications with a fraudulent charge case. Please don't delete the messages; they could be very helpful to you legally (mine were for me). If your name isn't on the lease/deed for the apartment, that can help your case. Consider consulting a lawyer and r/legaladvice to see if it is enough money to be worth filing in small claims court. Definitely reject the charge as fraudulent so it doesn't effect your credit (freeze your credit if it is practical for you). I'm so sorry she did this to you; I hope that you find helpful advice and know that many people are rooting for you."

selfharm,fczlo9n,t1_fczl3cz,1578103943.0,"I agree that the media does portray it as a female problem, probably due to our society's stupid obsession with repressing men's feelings. So far, there has been a scene of her covering up a bruise/scar on her arm with makeup, and shortly after, a scene of her biting into her arm until she drew blood"

selfharm,fczjsxu,t1_fczjc19,1578102789.0,"I had to take a little break after the sh scene, as it effected me pretty strongly, but I think it is a really good ice skating drama for adults. It's not light and fluffy like the ones you may have loved as a kid, and the main character is relatable to anyone who has gone through trauma or feels inadequate. I'm not even done with the first episode yet, but I've heard great things about the mental health representation in the show (at least one character is bipolar, apparently)."
