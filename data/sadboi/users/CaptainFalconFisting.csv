residentevil,fqcdia1,t1_fqb8nw9,1589255579.0,">Back then RE wasn't about action at all

Yeah it was. The movie came out after 3 and CV which started going towards that route. Just look at the helicopter tearing up a building with a gatling gun [opening cutscene of CV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ofRM_v6X94&t=1m41s). Heck, that scene in Apocalypse where Alice drops the gun then picks it up again to shoot stuff is [***from Claire doing the same thing in Code Veronica***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ofRM_v6X94&t=2m36s) 

[Capcom also said that 3 was taking more of an action route during its development process (just look at the dodge move).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_3:_Nemesis)

>Capcom also decided to give the game a more action-oriented style, which resulted in the 180-degree turn and the introduction of a dodge feature so that the player can avoid enemy attacks.[9] *Source is an Edge magazine August 1999. pp. 38â€“42."
residentevil,fqccjz2,t1_fqayepr,1589254948.0,"Yeah but Umbrella would have broken back into the HIVE even if Alice and the guy who becomes Nemesis had died. The first movie happened because the Umbrella operatives sent a team into the HIVE to figure out what happened, then in the second movie all the operatives die so they send in another team in to figure out what happened again. The outbreak would have happened regardless cause the second team going in gets overwhelmed by lickers and then the T virus gets into the city from the place the second operative team breached."

residentevil,fptxm1q,t3_gffh4t,1588900320.0,I think an RE4 remake should be more like RE2 remake purely because purely because we haven't seen RE4 as a pure horror game yet.

I.e if you're on the right side you dodge right if you're on the left side you dodge left so you always go away from the instakill zone. Maybe not do that all the time since the backflips would be weird to have to away from the center but when the mouth is about to attack definitely have the tentacles do roll attacks that move Leon away from the mouth instakill area. This video is funny af and I have never have seen a player die because of this but it honestly is an oversight that definitely should be fixed.

You drop that and then get used games at Gamestop (assuming they don't die due to Covid 19 killing sales) and you're in a pretty good spot money wise.

Now the next gen Series X and PS5, assuming they're $500 (or god forbid more, especially with the upcoming economic depression coming from Covid 19), there's a different argument to be made with that vs a PC.
