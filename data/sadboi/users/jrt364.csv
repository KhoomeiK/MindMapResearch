ADHD,fqp0x19,t1_fqoivqk,1589531098.0,"Usually heart rate monitoring problems come from people letting their watches (Garmin, Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.) stay loose. They don't need to be tight to the point they cut off circulation, but they need to stay in place and not move around on your wrist. They also need to be flush against the skin. Think of it like types of workout clothes fit: there are loose, fitted, and compression fit. You want the equivalent of compression fit with your wrist. This goes for any smartwatch.

All that said, no, I have not had issues with heart rate monitoring. The only thing the garmin sucks with (that I have noticed so far) is the automatic sleep logging. I think only the Fitbit and Apple Watch do good with that. Not sure about Samsung galaxy watch."
cycling,fqnfh5o,t1_fqneet8,1589493911.0,"Sorry. I probably wasn't clear, so let me clarify: I can spend up to $200, but if I'm paying $60 for a saddle bag when I can get a decent backpack starting at $60-70 (which has more uses, more compartments, and will most likely hold more), I think the backpack may be a better deal overall. It's not so much the $60 price tag. It's the fact I can get significantly more space for my buck with a backpack. It'd be different if the larger (4L+) saddle bags were like $30."
cycling,fqmt0rh,t1_fqmrmx8,1589483035.0,"Yeah, I thought about a larger saddle bag. The only problem is that some of the nicer (larger) saddle bags are $60+, and you can probably get a decent backpack for around that price.

ADHD,fql7px9,t1_fqkoxgp,1589449198.0,"I think it's great! I like that it always by default shows the date, time, resting heart rate, battery life, and if it's sundown/sunset. As someone with ADHD, you will appreciate those things immensely, especially  the battery life part because we tend to forget to charge things! Plus, I always forget what day of the week it is, so it's nice to see the date spelled out in the upper righthand corner. It also has the weather from Garmin's satellites!

I have smaller wrists as well and it is a little big on me myself, but there  are  girly colors to make a big watch appear ""less big/masculine"" if you're interested in that. Just be aware that places like Amazon US are selling the watches for cheaper than MSRP because those watches are the *Australian* versions, which is bad because apparently the Australian GPS watches don't work here.  So, I just bought mine from Best Buy.

Anyway, I think Garmins do an excellent job of capturing specific activities, like hiking, running, cycling, etc.. Fitbits do a decent job, but they're just not as good as the Garmins IMO. My Fitbit only did really well with capturing running. Everything else (cycling in specific) wasn't captured well. Plus, the GPS for capturing your routes, etc. is a nice touch for your data."

I'm kind of wondering if that whole resting heart rate thing is linked to obesity studies, though. People who are obese tend to have higher resting heart rates, and thus can have a whole host of other problems with it (e.g., high cholesterol, heart disease, etc.). So if said studies only looked at heart rate and didn't consider BMI/weight (for example), then it's hard to draw conclusions about stimulants since those meds artificially increase your heart rate.

Personally, I think if you're trying to lose weight and/or build muscle, it's probably better to have a heavier bike anyway. I'm not saying you should go out and buy the heaviest bike you can get, but you'll get more of a workout with a heavier bike than a lighter bike. I think if you're into racing, it's good to have a heavier bike for training and a lighter bike for racing, where it matters.

But yeah, losing weight is easiest and most effective. I've never done a Tour de France or any kind of race, but I suppose if you're doing that or going very long distances (e.g., 60 miles in one day), a 0.4% reduction in weight may actually help someone. But that's an extreme case and I don't think most people are doing that kind of stuff."
Gameboy,fpt32bk,t1_fpt1mw7,1588884006.0,"Yeah, I think it'll be a while before the shipping situation gets fixed. :(

If you're interested, I recommend looking at [Health Data's COVID-19 projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america). Lots of other academic sites are saying similar things where they suspect the number of cases to PLATEAU in August, but not necessarily decline. However, that is up for debate since some states started opening up on May 1st and we should expect to see a large surge in number of cases. A second wave.

But yeah, based on predictive models, I wouldn't be surprised if we have to wait for Fall time before JapanPost, etc. starts shipping to the U.S. again. Our country is a total shitshow right now."

> Shipping: $24.99 Expedited Shipping from outside US | See details
International shipment of items may be subject to customs processing and additional charges.  

If you're looking at eBay, can you ask the seller for a different shipping method, maybe? I don't recall ever paying for expedited shipping when I've  bought from places like Japan4You. Items always took 2-3 weeks to get here (Boston, MA) with regular shipping, but now it says 1 week expedited shipping for $24.99. I wonder if they're using something like FedEx Japan or DHL to ship their items, because FedEx/DHL are one of the few carriers that is still going to/from U.S. to Asia on a regular basis. No one really wants to go to the U.S. because of the number of COVID-19 infections here, but FedEx is a U.S. company obviously, so that's probably why they're still going. Similar stuff with DHL. So my  bet is  that the carrier is FedEx, DHL, or something like that, and FedEx/DHL is always more expensive than Air Japan or whatever."

If you're looking for eBay sellers, I would recommend GodofGaming. He charges a bit much sometimes, but I've never had any problems with him and I've bought literally like 30-40 things from him (typically in bulk though).

People tend to solve this problem by shaving down some internals on the shell. Have you tried that? Look to see where the shell has pressure, and see if  there are any gaps. 

Another thing you might  want  to check is if your internal screws are tightened all the way. I know that sounds silly, but I have  had that issue before where I didn't tighten them all the way. Some of the screw posts on these aftermarket shells cause the screws to go in at slight angle, which gives the appearance and feel that the screw is tightened appropriately, when it  is, indeed, not in the screw post all the way."

bicycling,fppi4i6,t1_fppcvq1,1588802696.0,"If you're planning hundreds of miles every week, you'll want to spend way more than $300 on a bike. The quality of the components on a $300 bike just won't get you what you're asking for. That's like Dick's Sporting Goods or Walmart quality. The parts will breakdown prematurely compared to higher quality parts, and you'll end up investing more money into fixing broken parts than you would if you invested in, say, a $500 or $600 bike up front. I mean, we're talking about parts breaking down after like maybe 20-40 miles, if that. Those bikes are meant for the weekend warrior type, not the avid cyclist type. So, I personally think it's best to invest more money up front if you can and are willing. If you're up for it, you can try the used market to see what good you can get for $300. You'll probably get a better quality bike used for $300, than a new $300 bike.

Since you're in the Long Island area, you should be able to sell a new bike w/o a problem, should you decide you don't want to bike anymore after a few months. If you pay $200 for an old used bike from the 90s, good luck selling that. You're more likely to sell a brand new $400 bike for $200, than you are to sell a $200 90s bike for $200 or less.

Gameboy,fp2afqx,t1_fp2ab6i,1588258277.0,"You're welcome!

I just realized their page is under maintenance until tomorrow, so check back tomorrow. They normally have thousands of items on sale. I have bought many, many things from them with no problem. 🙂"
Gameboy,fp283j2,t1_fp27fpj,1588257011.0,"That's good you have Mr. Sheen. I live in the U.S. where we don't have that. However, I would recommend watching some of TRF's videos. Have a look at  this one where he's got a lot of crap on his GBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNtCaEZCft8"
Gameboy,fp26c63,t1_fp25saf,1588256036.0,"I bought some aftermarket SP batteries from eBay, but I bought them in bulk because I have a bunch of SPs.

[This listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Rechargeable-Battery-for-Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-SP-Systems-Screwdriver/400660668966?epid=1602987613&hash=item5d493ca226:g:bKcAAOSweWVXfQdK), unlike others, comes bundled with a screwdriver, which you may find useful. I  have that particular battery and it works fine. The screwdriver is ""meh"" because  it's really tiny, but if you're not modding consoles, then it will do the job."
Gameboy,fp25jsl,t1_fp244kx,1588255581.0,"Not OP, but have you checked the JAPAN4YOU seller on eBay? Here is their eBay store: https://www.ebay.com/str/japan4youstore"
Gameboy,fp24hml,t1_fp2472d,1588254965.0,"I dunno. You can try tapping the battery cover with your fingernail. If it sounds solid, then there might be a battery in there. If it echoes or sounds plasticky, then maybe there's nothing in there. You can also apply some pressure to the battery cover to see if it bends in. If there's a battery in there, it shouldn't give because the battery cover is flush against the battery when there is a battery in there."
Gameboy,fp23g27,t3_gavn39,1588254356.0,What country are you in? I know that The Retro Future uses Mr. Sheen to clean off all the markers and tape residue off his Game Boys.
Gameboy,fp238hs,t3_gavpp2,1588254232.0,"Very cool!

What is the second game?  (The girl with the blonde pigtails.) Tomagachi?"
Gameboy,fp230yn,t3_gaus79,1588254110.0,I love how the clear blue buttons match the color of the shell really well. I really like how it came out. Nice work!
Gameboy,fp22u3c,t1_fp22a14,1588253994.0,"Does the charging port wiggle around when you try to plug in the power adapter? Is the charging port dirty? You can try lightly blowing into the charging port to blow out some dust (if there is any). You may need to gently scrape out the gunk in there if you see any. Though, if it's a refurb (modded), I would assume that there is not a ton of gunk, if any, in there, but I guess you never know.

It could be there is no battery, as someone else said."
Gameboy,fp20a4z,t1_fp1zqic,1588252362.0,"The knockoff carts? Sorry, I should have clarified. When I say ""knockoff cart,"" I don't mean knockoff flashcarts (although those do exist). I'm talking about bootlegs like the Zelda one you posted. Those ones are the ones that can have problems.

I personally think there is a risk of buying knockoff flashcarts because they are cheap clones just like the bootlegs you posted. Like I'm talking about the knockoffs of Krikzzz's flashcarts, and those flashcart knockoffs have the same problems as the bootlegs. Plus, it takes away money from the original developer (Krikzzz) who spent time, money, and energy into developing something awesome. But I suppose there is [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000370146306.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.4ea763ec81QERv&algo_pvid=4a41a413-7e47-4e36-a9b1-0a6a4c7b1c52&algo_expid=4a41a413-7e47-4e36-a9b1-0a6a4c7b1c52-7&btsid=0ab6d69f15882522217911718e4bed&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_). Obviously not GBA, but yeah... AliExpress has them. You can search ""gameboy flashcart"" on Ali."
Gameboy,fp1yzpw,t1_fp1yfqr,1588251504.0,"I personally use the EZ Flash Omega. Some people said they have problems with it, but I have never had problems in the 2 years I have been using it.

http://www.ezflash.cn/dealers/

It normally goes for $50-60 USD, but if you think about it... a single knockoff cart will cost you between $5-10 on eBay. If you get 5 knockoffs, you may have spent up to $50. It is nice having only one cart (the flashcart), too. And you can load up hundreds of games on it.

EDIT: One dealer  has it for $47 -- https://www.etsy.com/listing/663573587/ez-flash-omega-4-gameboy-advance-gba"
Gameboy,fp1w8d9,t1_fp0wsfn,1588249534.0,"I personally like the clearish lines, but everyone has their personal preferences and there's nothing wrong with anyone disliking it. I definitely don't see the purpose in downvoting you if you're being honest and explaining your reasoning. I can't speak for everyone, but I only downvote  someone if they give a shitty reply without explaining why they disagree."
Gameboy,fp1vsls,t1_fp1uj16,1588249199.0,Some unknown person in China probably. The factories in China that make these replacement cases always come up with new designs to sell and it's never known who the specific person is. I think that goes for a lot of custom things made in china. But I could be wrong.
Gameboy,fp1va0w,t3_gatuob,1588248791.0,"I can't really tell, but you can try to buy some polarizing films for dirt cheap. [You can get smartphone ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/5i4lhp/where_would_i_get_front_polarizing_film_for_a_gb/db5atm8/). (And yes, I realize that  post says GB Pocket, but it's the same for a DMG.) If not, you can get a backlit LCD to replace the OG display you have. I know that's a much more expensive option, but backlit LCDs are nice if you can't salvage the display."
Gameboy,fp1v0s6,t3_garhaz,1588248586.0,"I've done the same with my New 3DS XL. I love the 3DS for CFW!

P.S. I think the white 3DS with the colored buttons are super cool. I wanted that 3DS but could never get one. :("
Gameboy,fp1uhyx,t1_fp1smmq,1588248162.0,"Probably. But there's no guarantee that your save won't get destroyed, or that the game will allow you to play it all the way through without crashing.

If you're planning on buying a bootleg, then you obviously don't care about legit carts, which is 100% fine. Since that's the case, I would personally just grab a flashcart (e.g., one of Krikzzz's ones or EZ Flash Omega) and download your games to it. You can get ROMs from a reputable source that are very likely to work fine."
Gameboy,fp1u836,t3_gau1f2,1588247934.0,"I know this may sound stupid, but do you have another SP lying around where you can swap out the battery to see if it's a battery problem?

Also, does the console stay on if it's plugged in? If so, I would think it's *likely* a battery problem, but could be a problem with the charging port."
Gameboy,fp0gotw,t1_fp0fxiz,1588208914.0,"Yeah, there is no guarantee on the carts, but there are some dead giveaways, like overcontrasted cart stickers, cart stickers that are crooked, the top of the cart saying ""GAME"" instead of GAME BOY, etc.. I also look for scratches when people post pics. For example, there are typically two smooth, vertical scratches on GB and GBC games on the back of the cart from being used. For example, [see this pic](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/013/941/604/large/karena-williams-presentationshot-used.jpg?1541758777). Also, some people will take pics of the PCB inside the plastic casing to show that it has ""Nintendo"" stamped on it in white lettering instead of being brand less.

No guarantees, but you can open them up to see. Plus, even GameStop may have fakes. No guarantee there either. But yeah, tiny scratches may be a good hint that it's legit, when you consider the other things I said."
Gameboy,fp0fk5k,t3_galcrx,1588208288.0,"It's a gamble. I have gotten carts in seriously good condition from GameStop, while others have been scratched to death.

If you want to ""guarantee"" you'll get a cart in very good or excellent condition, you'll have to look at eBay pics or Mercari pics. And I put ""guarantee"" in quotes because nothing is 100% guaranteed, but at least you get to see what you're buying and return it if the item is not as described. Not sure how easy GameStop's return process is, but eBay is easy."
Jokes,fp07u9b,t1_fp073pe,1588204108.0,"You're seriously fucked up. I called you out for lying about your dog dying, so then everyone downvoted you. Then you deleted your comment after 70+ downvotes thinking that people wouldn't see you repost this?

NintendoSwitchDeals,foz3do5,t1_foyx4st,1588184002.0,"Huh. I've never played the Switch version (although I do have it), but I did play Ys games on the PSP. I really enjoyed the mechanics and battle system. The stories were ok in my book, but I will admit they didn't blow me away like some of the Final Fantasy ones did. I really enjoyed the games overall, though, and I've heard the story in this one is better than previous installments of Ys."
NintendoSwitchDeals,foyiztj,t1_foyfp8q,1588173390.0,"Looks like it's out of stock on amazon tho.

Seems like this game is selling out fast everywhere. It's at a decent price, but not the all-time low."
NintendoSwitchDeals,foy039o,t3_ga68tk,1588161811.0,"Dead deal. It's now $37.43 as of the writing of this comment and says ""Sold & Shipped by Walmart.""

If you want it still, [Best Buy has it for $29.99](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tales-of-vesperia-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch/6255190.p). I know it's more expensive, but I'm just pointing it out."
CasualConversation,fosf9op,t1_foscxd8,1588029565.0,"Damn, good point on stretching. Thanks for the reminder! I will definitely stretch now.

Sorry to hear about the cramps. That sounds really sucky. I plan on riding for 1 hour when I start, and I don't expect myself to do more than a few miles without huffing and puffing. lol."
CasualConversation,fosezmc,t1_fosdgvz,1588029410.0,"Yeah, the belly is where all the flab is on me too. I used to have a flat stomach and now I've got major ""love handles"" or ""muffin top"" or whatever you wanna call it. Haha. :(

I know this may sound controversial, but I think if you do exercise, it should always be fun and something you genuinely enjoy doing. Otherwise, you just won't stick with it because people aren't motivated to do boring things, especially if those things are optional to do."
CasualConversation,foscw7q,t1_foscj6a,1588028247.0,"Thank you! I tried to start exercising a month ago, but I had difficulties staying motivated. Now that this weight/cholesterol situation is rapidly spiraling out of control, I have to take control back. You're right that whether I can see the results or not, I should be able to feel them. :)"
CasualConversation,foscky7,t1_foscc9n,1588028075.0,"Thanks :)

I also need to get outside anyways because I've been locking myself up in my apartment due to COVID-19. Fortunately going out to exercise is not banned here (yet)."
Advice,foqhw3l,t1_foqg6pu,1587993940.0,"Thanks. I would do it on a rainy day, but I'm afraid soap suds would fall below and then their balcony looks like someone took a bubble bath on it. lol.

I'll try a small bowl though. Thanks. Helped."

Advice,foqfvcx,t1_foqda4d,1587992584.0,Yeah. I just don't want to drip water on the angry drunk/wifebeater downstairs because he seems to be the violent type. I guess I'm just being overly anxious about it. Helped.
bikewrench,fooy6ny,t1_foovhnx,1587948971.0,"Thanks. I'll wipe down the chain.

I know this is a stupid question, but... do you know if I need to wear gloves for cleaning and lubing the chain? I want to wear gloves, but everyone bought out all the nitrile/latex gloves because of coronavirus. \*sigh\*"
NintendoSwitchDeals,fomwzfj,t3_g89h49,1587906415.0,"Since I just took a pic for someone else, here's what the SN30 Pro+ looks like compared to the Pro Controller: https://i.imgur.com/hToe1YE.jpg

I have DualShock 4 controller grips on my SN30 Pro+ (not included), so if you want to use grips with the SN30 Pro+, just use the DualShock 4 ones. So that's an added bonus if you have a PS4.

They're both good controllers. I think $40 is a good price for this one here. I bought it for full price when it came out and have not regretted it."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fomwl47,t1_fomvg8x,1587906078.0,"That's a good question.  I suppose I should clarify. I think for the Switch only, the Pro Controller is better. However, if you're into PC gaming or have a hacked device for retro gaming (e.g., tablet, hacked PS One Mini, etc.), you can use the SN30 Pro+ with that and sync with ease. So the SN30 Pro+ *does* have more uses.

Feel wise, both controllers have sturdy plastic. Neither of them squeak or crack, so I can't say that one is significantly less durable than the other. I just took a pic of the two side by side: https://i.imgur.com/hToe1YE.jpg

I think there  is less travel on the SN30 Pro+ face buttons, now that I'm feeling both. So, you kinda have to factor in a delay when you're pressing the Switch Pro controller buttons. The D-pad on  the SN30 Pro+ feels better too. However, I like the ergonomics of the Switch Pro Controller better. I like the beefier feel to it and I think it looks sleeker.  You can also wake up the Switch with the Pro Controller. You cannot do that with the SN30 Pro+, which is a big downside to me. BUT it's as simple as using a pair of joycons and opening the controller menu to sync the SN30 Pro+."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fomurs1,t1_fomted8,1587904484.0,"Like bullfrog_jem said, they do have rubber and I have not noticed any deadzones.

I have a PS4 and I am able to use my DualShock 4 thumbstick grips on the SN30 Pro+ controller thumbsticks. So, if thumbstick grip longevity concerns you, you can get some of those."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fomjzlp,t1_fome5py,1587892883.0,"I have both the Pro Controller and the SN30 Pro+. I prefer the Pro Controller over the SN30 Pro+. However, for $40, this controller is  a  steal. It's way better than the $50 wireless PowerA ones (IMO), which have some known quality control issues.

I have had the SN30 Pro+ since its release and I have had NO problems with it. I alternate using it with my pro controller (depending on which one is charging). I have no problems adjusting to the different thumbstick orientations."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fo6x1dk,t1_fo6qg8l,1587568315.0,"Wow, I had no idea about Yooka Laylee devs having worked on DKC! That is super cool. Now I have to look into this game. Not OP, but thanks!"

NintendoSwitchDeals,fo646si,t3_g5xibk,1587545862.0,"I have both the SN30 Pro and SN30 Pro Plus. The SN30 Pro is great for travel. It's slim and doesn't take up a ton of space. Has a great D-pad and the thumbsticks are great too. Face buttons and trigger buttons feel nice as well. However, I will admit that the Plus has better ergonomics and I prefer the feel of it. BUT that does not mean the regular SN30 Pro is a bad option."
cycling,fo13ozr,t1_fo0yc49,1587425114.0,"Thanks!  Makes a lot of sense.
