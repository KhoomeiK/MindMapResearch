don't know how good you can get in 5 months, but 1 year in you should pretty much be ready to take entry level commissioned work if you practice seriously 2 hours almost every day. the quickest way to get results you will like though is to copy other artists, see how they solved the problem of representing things into drawings and simply copy them...but be warned, it's no substitute for learning to solve the problem yourself"

seduction,fnr0crt,t1_fnpz0hg,1587176261.0,"i want to piggyback on this comment cause it's pretty good & goes in line with my own experiences. i had the same issue too when i started dating, what i've figured out is that women are very insecure, if you don't show any sexual interest they will start to question if you actually like them or not, a girl that's really into you might give you a lot of chances to move the relationship along but if you never get around too it she's gonna find someone who will, and if she's attractive she'll have no trouble doing so.

did you grow up in a family like mine? affection was just not a thing for the most part, when i first heard the words ""i love you"" come out of my dads mouth i was in my 20's, it felt very uncomfortable. and my mom has never said those words to me in my whole life. this clearly had an effect on my own ability to show affection and i know of a lot of other people who also went through a similar thing stemming from either neglectful or abusive parents.

as for how to solve the issue just take it slow. take it slow & date a lot. girls will usually let you know in some way if they want you to start making moves, one time i went out on a movie date with a girl and she started kicking my leg during the movie, or sometimes you'll be walking side by side and they'll start bumping into you. most girls will not make the first move for you so you have to really pay attention, if a girl ever touches you first it's usually a good indication that you can start getting more physical too...just start things off slow, holding hands etc, eventually as you gain more dating experience you'll be able to tell if girls like you, if they're receptive to you escalating, you'll develop cleaver ways to get things physical, these days as soon as i meet a girl for a date i go in for a tight hug as soon as i see her, a lot of them get all flustered but that's a good sign & they usually get way more comfortable with touching you first like that. you'll eventually find out what works for you.

dating women is the best way to learn, don't be afraid to screw up either, everything i've learned came from all the failures i've had throughout my dating life, i'd also usually ask my exes what things they liked or didn't like & why things didn't work out, women are actually very open with guys about how to court them properly but you usually just don't listen, you have to really pay attention to what they say, when they say it & read between the lines. take things slow in all regards, don't be needy or overly jealous, get over your ego & let girls roam, that saying women are like boats & men are like islands couldn't be any truer. i just think of women like cats, have you ever had a cat? pet them one too many times & they wanna claw your face off. they also do whatever the fuck they want, when they want so don't bother trying to push them into anything"

i doubt the general public would pick up on this if it was adopted unless they go around rummaging through SPD circles

this one i just find amusing

the symbol is so bland it won't register on most peoples radars, maybe some comic or science nerds, but it ain't enough to be a conversation starter on it's own"

i just think it'd be cool to be walkin down the street n see someone wearing a recognizable symbol & be like ""oh, there goes a fellow schizoid"" or run into one at the bar & enjoy not talking to each other over a pint lol

&#x200B;

you know i do go out every once in a blue moon, moving around a lot usually means having no friends to hang with for a while so i'm usually that creepy guy in the corner all alone, one time some guy approached me asking if i had any drugs for sale (not the last time), that's how out of place you look out there on your own"

i've seen how other ""warmer"" parents act with their children, very physical & verbally supportive. i never had any of that. my parents were great i still think mind you, but that emotional distance & lack of support obviously did a number on my persona, it makes you tough, perhaps a little too tough, and jaded, you learn to get validation from yourself, compliments or emotions from others mean absolutely nothing"
Schizoid,fljxj38,t3_fpb6ds,1585229225.0,"i've done all sorts of jobs. the ones i enjoyed the most are obviously the ones with little human interaction; truck driving, medical/contract courier, security guard, data entry, IT, web/software development, art

there's a whole world of opportunities, you could get a call center job working from home within a week, or an IT job in a month or two after taking your compTIA, maybe like 3-6 months for web dev"

learnart,fl657kh,t3_fmt7x8,1584854839.0,"what's wrong with starting at the beginning? that's how i learn everything. when learning a song i will play it from start to finish & if at any point i make a mistake i will start over until i can make it through the whole song with no errors, then i will play 10 times more just to make sure

same with learning  VFX for example, i will watch a tutorial and follow along then i'll do it without the tutorial, then i'll come back the next day & do it without the tutorial again, if i can't do it i'll go back and follow along with the tutorial. then back to trying it without the next day and if i get it i'll move on to the next effect & do both, if at any point i mess up i go back to the beginning and keep going like that with a queue of 4-5 effects & reviewing older ones periodically 

same with learning languages, i'll take quizes & flashcards til it sticks. any error takes me back to the beginning

i should just let this pass"
Schizoid,fkphqei,t1_fkotrjh,1584410436.0,"> in fact i believe she is married or engaged, she has a ring on her finger = safety = makes infatuation easier/possible

well i didn't know she was married when i first met her, i was just instantly drawn. i'm thinking maybe i picked up subconsciously on the fact she had absolutely no makeup or jewelry on (not even earrings), these are things i noticed later on, after i started thinking about telling her. i'm attracted to social deviancy but usually it swings in the other extreme, not on plain janes

> God no. No, no no. I have been on the receiving end of this situation more times than I care to think about. You're basically a complete stranger to this person. it would be stupid. And creepy.

yeah. that's why i've been waiting til the last moment, in the last couple of days we'll have very little opportunities to run into each other and once we go our separate ways we'll most likely never see each other ever again, but maybe this is why i'm here, i need someone to talk me out of this cause right now i'm leaning towards the telling her side more than not

i need to think about this on a social level. i'm a very rational thinker, i hate not being able to explain to myself logically this infatuation or why i want to tell her"

it's not a great opener for someone you just met but i doubt this girl would react too harshly, she might try to get me some help"
Schizoid,fko71dp,t1_fko49fn,1584381359.0,"i can admit to being infatuated, but love? why am i so unsure of that?

if i wanted any kind of ongoing relationship, like you said i would certainly not clue her in to anything SPD related. even with the girl i almost got married to i never told her anything about my real personality cause i know just like then that if i tell her everything i want to tell her it's probably going to freak her out"
Schizoid,fknyvzp,t1_fknxand,1584376748.0,"> I know in the past I've had a habit of falling hard for any girl that treats me nicely and is cute, I dont know enough about your situation to really give solid advice but it kind of sounds like that to me.

i've only spoken to her once, and it was a mostly professional conversation

> also beware of building an image of the perfect woman in your head and being dissapointed when she doesnt match up.

lol don't worry, i'm experienced enough this already, though i won't deny my headspace has ran through multiple scenarios or outcomes both good & bad. however from what i do know & can tell about her she is quite humble, she didn't seem bothered when i approached her to talk, she wears no makeup or jewelry, she does volunteer work, pretty sure she's a devout christian, not that someone like this wouldn't have their flaws or could even be a horrible person in disguise, but she sure is trying. could someone fake it this long? she's moved states a couple of times, why keep up a facade for this long in a place where nobody knows you?

anyway we're kinda moving into relationship territory here which is like i said not really what i'm looking for, i'd probably be terrified to get into one. i've already been hit on like twice this year by girls i found attractive so if i wanted one i could've been in one...i just really can't explain this infatuation"

i could probably handle the situation a lot better now, i think the person is just looking for reassurance that you are as committed as they are to the relationship, getting into arguments or dipping out likely just fuels their insecurities cause they're constantly giving more than they receive, they likely feel like ""if you're not giving it to me then you must be giving it to someone else"" which can lead to resentment & hate play (i'll go flirt with that guy over there, see how you like it), cause in their mind you are cheating, why else wouldn't you show the same kind of devotion back right?

BPD,fkbn4yu,t1_fka4zhs,1584036091.0,"having dated someone with BPD i can tell you exactly why, it's not the molding, manipulation or passion, it's the obsessiveness...the attachment, the jealousy, the loyalty, you feel that the person is completely devoted to you and only you, for a man that's like kryptonite. it's surprising how loyal ppl with BPD are, too bad you go mental and push ppl away, specially when you feel you've been wronged. i would've married this particular girlfriend & i've been saying i would never get married since i was a little kid but her constant accusations of cheating made me doubt & then i broke it off & she wouldn't take me back after that"
