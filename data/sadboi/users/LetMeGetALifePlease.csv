Some very hard words to hear, but her time has passed. Talk to close family or friends you trust, or maybe take the time to focus on yourself more. 


I want to be here to say, that in your time of grief, its gonna be okay to be a little selfish. Don't ever feel bad for these emotions you feel, and it will be okay to just cry it out.

I still cover my scars whenever someone confronts me about them whether its direct or indirect. I have a story for who ever wants to read it. 

I was at Walmart one morning getting my school supplies before I had school that day. My mom was also in the market for some camera (long story short people stole from us) so she could put around the house. She called a worker over, an old lady probably around her late 40s or mid 50s. She was helpful and stuff, but she wouldn't stop staring at my arm. I was used to the staring though but just turned at an angle cause she was staring way too long for comfort. After helping us she led us to the checkout at the front (electronics is in the far back), before she left though she gripped my arm and was wAY too close for me. She told me ""the lord loves you"" and then walked off... I'm not religious. 

Things like that just triggers me. I wore the only hoodie that was clean that day. But it was really really hot, and the hoodie was black.."
