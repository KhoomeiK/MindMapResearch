lifeafterdeath,fq8ht1z,t1_fpxom11,1589166514.0,Thank you for this. Iâ€™m so happy that you were able to have this experience. I would do anything just to see my mom again.
lifeafterdeath,fpfd9ey,t3_e8jnir,1588567900.0,Thank you.  I appreciate your sharing.  Iâ€™ve just tried everything I know to contact so I k ow sheâ€™s ok. Thatâ€™s she not lonely.  That sheâ€™s happy. Iâ€™ve spent a fortune on psychics and tried prayer and meditation.  Nothing works.  Itâ€™s just all consuming.  I am so happy for you that your loved one has contacted you ðŸ’—
lifeafterdeath,foxax1x,t1_foluaji,1588138621.0,But how do you know? And what happens when the grief overwhelms you? Day after Day you canâ€™t escape it?
lifeafterdeath,fad2h08,t1_facyux4,1575953291.0,May I ask what your experience was? Iâ€™m sorry to be so personal and Iâ€™m so sorry you lost your dad.
