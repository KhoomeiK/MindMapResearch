The reason you’re so hungry is because after you restrict for a while (esp if it’s to an underweight BMI), once your body starts getting the nutrients it desperately needs, your survival instincts go into overdrive. Your body can’t tell the difference between a famine and anorexia so anytime you stop eating for long periods of time, once you start eating your body will tell you to keep eating as much as you can because it doesn’t know when you’ll have access to food again. Eventually, your body will readjust to regular nourishment and your weight will stabilize as long as you listen to your body’s signals"

EDAnonymous,f76zmuw,t3_dulohu,1573439970.0,"Honestly I don’t even have any social media besides reddit so I know for a fact that social media doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it. I think for some it might start off that way, but I think those that are especially prone to eating disorders usually have far deeper reasons"
bulimia,f6za2c1,t3_dtwh6q,1573313216.0,"Be careful! Binging and purging is SO addictive and even though it seems like a quick fix, it can become an entirely different problem on its own"
EDAnonymous,f6vngf7,t3_dtaxfr,1573192113.0,Yup all night every night :)) I think it’s due to your body’s survival instincts trying to extend your energy until you find food. It’s literally the worst but I cope by listening to really quiet music and trying to lay still w my eyes closed until I eventually succumb to my exhaustion
EDAnonymous,f6k8ks2,t1_f6jbmh1,1572907451.0,"I get it, it’s hard to talk about this stuff. It’s easier here where it’s somewhat anonymous but dw you gotta start somewhere and just showing up to an appointment is brave"

EDAnonymous,f53mj0s,t3_dmou7o,1571961485.0,"I totally get this, I skip at least 1 class every week because of my ED related lifestyle and it sucks. Really making the most of higher EDucation lol. One thing that’s helped me is going to my schools therapy (it’s free) and forcing myself to go to class so I can at least pretend to be normal. College is hard but if you wanna make friends you gotta meet people and classes are one of the best ways because you already have something in common. I know it seems impossible but you have to start somewhere, I believe in you 💙"
bulimia,f4zblvg,t3_dmcu94,1571902936.0,"Go to your normal doctor and tell them the truth. They can get some tests to check on the state of your health, and they can help refer you to a reputable therapist or psychiatrist that has worked w ED patients before. At your first appointment, you can discuss a plan or strategy, I’m sure they will be well equipped to help you. Good for you for taking care of yourself and taking the first step! You’re so brave and I wish you the best of luck  💕"

EDAnonymous,f4adpn9,t3_dk3cxc,1571493066.0,"I’d just enjoy the food for now and let yourself savor it since it’s out of your control, and deal with the fallout later on, when you’re not around friends. You can always try and exercise it off or something later"
bulimia,f446spw,t3_djco7f,1571348664.0,"Swish Baking soda mixed with water around your mouth for about a minute, then use a fluoride mouth wash, then floss. Wait about 20 minutes before actually brushing your teeth, though, because if you do it too soon you end up brushing the acid further into your teeth which causes more harm than good."

EDAnonymous,f35ksy3,t3_dfs3eb,1570680662.0,The only time I enjoy eating is when I’m watching Netflix lol. Pretty sure it’s because it distracts me from my discomfort concerning food
EDAnonymous,f2dxs8a,t3_dd3ab7,1570169641.0,"Wow idk what government agency you work for but this post was definitely taken directly from my subconscious. Fr though, i feel you 100%. I know I’m underweight and I def can see that when I look at myself but even at my lowest, very underweight weights, I feel like my legs don’t even look that much skinnier? Def not the legs of someone supposedly malnourished smh so yea we’re def in this together"
