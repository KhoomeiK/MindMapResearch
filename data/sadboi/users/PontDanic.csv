If the gaules didn't get romanized, history in europe could be wildly diffrent. I guess looking at the germans and the irish would give us some clues how a tribal people in europe would develope after rome is gone. They would still use the latin alphabet for example. They would probably feel some kinship to other european groups but look more to the norse then the south. Maybe they would be a united people sharing traditions from all over gaul or maybe they would be balkanised and not consider each other as one ethnicity.
