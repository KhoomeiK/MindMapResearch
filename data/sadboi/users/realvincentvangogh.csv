AskReddit,fjs0r9c,t3_fepsha,1583592364.0,"Not nearly as bad as most of the things listed here but I think there are two times I nearly died.

The first was when I was about 13. We had a swing in our yard that I used to absolutely love and it had been there for about 10 years at that point. The wood was rotting and I was getting heavier too so on that day, I sat down on it one more time, swung a few times until I heard it crack and next thing I know was me sitting on the ground with the collapsed swing and my dog scared shitless next to me. I would have been hit square in the head by the wooden barrel above if I had been swinging a little slower.

The second time was one and a half years ago. I had a severe bronchitis that wasn't treated correctly so it never fully healed which led to me developing asthma. When I had the first major attack, I was coughing my lungs out, vomited and couldn't inhale. My stomach was turning upside down and my throat was closing and I couldn't inhale for the life of me. I couldn't even scream for help and was panicking and crying and trying to get to where my mum was. By the time I got to our living room, it somehow got a tiny bit better and my mum was able to calm me down and I started to get better and could breath shallow again. I haven't had such an attack since and I got put on meds so hopefully that won't happen again."

He then paused and said something along the lines of ""well, if your patient's problems resonate within you then that probably means there's something similar inside you too"". He meant that if you, the therapist, feel really bad after a session or relate to the patient, there's something off with you too and that's a sign you should take care of yourself.

That could be an animal, or plants, or drawing. Keeping plants might require you to go to the store to get soil, pots, nutrients and shovels or whatnot. Keeping a pet obviously will require you to meet the pets needs which might be a bit much depending on the pet but you get rewarded by the love and affection they show you. Drawing on the other hand is a skill that requires practice and you need to get pencils, paper, canvases and paint and stuff which you could order online but you could also try to go to little shops in your area and start out by just looking around there and once you get more comfortable you could buy something to support your hobby. Oh you could also volunteer at a dog shelter as someone who walks the dogs maybe once you get more comfortable? I think animals, especially dogs, are a great way to get back in touch with the world and with feeling. Maybe you're not the type to get along well with animals, i don't know, but that's the thing that came to my mind first.

During the lesson, while the teacher was there. I don't know what followed afterwards but it's so creepy to think about what strange and potentially dangerous people are out there.

I'm sorry you lost your earrings, that must've sucked."

AskReddit,ffqpuwp,t1_ffqdvwa,1580140851.0,A possible explanation but not a very likely one though since this happened in rural Germany in my very small hometown. There actually is only one single Japanese restaurant in my whole state (Thuringia)

AskReddit,fflt8wi,t3_etts4s,1580043835.0,"A poem by Erin Hanson:

I plant a row of dairy seeds
In the space below each eye
So they remind you of your beauty
When they bloom
Each time you
Cry

This is not most inspiring poem but I'm thinking of my loved ones saying this to me while reciting it in my mind every time I feel down.

Then there's another thing I read recently, I don't remember the author but wrote it down into my journal:

After a period of sadness, happiness doesn't jump back into your life.
It grows back slowly in the crevasses of your soul, like small plants which sprout in cracked concrete;
It creeps softly up to you until eventually it's walking by your side, so quietly you barely even notice."
