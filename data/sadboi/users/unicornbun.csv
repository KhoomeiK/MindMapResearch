He dropped hints, like saying he has meds he has to take (but I never pushed the issue). Further, he took many years off school to tackle his depression, and he initially told me it was to take care of a sick relative (which was partially true). He probably told me about his mental health after about 2 months. Maybe that is shocking for some people, but I was 100% understanding of why he didn't tell me earlier and was supportive of what he's gone through. I'm able to separate a person from their illness and I recognize that sometimes what he does isn't his fault, but the mental illness's fault. I don't see anything wrong with you not telling someone right away. It takes a while for people to get to know each other and trust each other.

I was depressed and anxious for years. I tried therapy and meds (meds helped...didnt like my therapist so much) and currently practice yoga and meditation.

My partner is very understanding of my BPD but I believe it's because I'm medicated/in DBT and making improvements...if I wasn't doing anything to better myself I'm sure he would have walked out by now. I was diagnosed after we started dating though. If I were on the receiving end, I'd want the person to wait for at least a few dates (maybe a month?), and reassure me that they're working toward improving themselves. 

Only a few of my friends know about BPD. I don't really feel obligated to tell them though. Although part of me wants to fight the stigma of BPD by talking freely about it, but of course that's easier said than done!"
iih,f86opal,t1_f86m5oq,1574303280.0,"I had a whole issue with it...it caused my IIH (IMO...I'm not overweight and didn't have any other risk factors other than being a woman lol) but doctors wouldn't make that connection and no body recommended that I should remove it. I made the decision to remove it on my own and I just told my gyno I didn't want it any more. Saved the headache of trying to get a doctor on my side because they really don't keep up with the latest literature. Of course every one is different but if you wanted support, there's a ton of case reports and other literature out there that you could provide to your Drs!"
iih,f867ar8,t3_dz9fun,1574291466.0,"I have no issues w sex.  Also, I'm concerned about some of the advice you've gotten. The mirena is linked to IIH (class action lawsuits) so I don't think it was a good ides to put you on that. The research and knowledge about IIH is limited so you'll have to be your own advocate."
labrats,f7okq1d,t3_dx79j8,1573929073.0,I was on my PhD programs admissions committee for several years.  You're fine calling yourself that
zoloft,f77y7l0,t3_duo7ao,1573479883.0,It's a common initial side effect...it should go away (for me it took maybe a week)
BPD,f74u8le,t3_ducbe8,1573407992.0,"Yes!! My partner's diet drives me insane and is enough to make me split. I had an eating disorder in college and was always obsessed with my weight as a kid (not as a late 20s adult though...or so I thought?) so I'm starting to wonder if I'm projecting my issues onto him or if he really needs to work on his diet, or both."
Borderline,f74nprg,t3_duafzr,1573405344.0,It goes hand in hand with self-forgiveness. Recovery isn't linear. I'm practicing self-love but after a borderline episode I need to forgive myself and think of all the progress I've made.
zoloft,f6i1me9,t3_drcyxa,1572870163.0,"I was diagnosed with bpd in June and started zoloft in September. My moods and anxiety are dramatically better. I still have my mood swings but they're less intense and zoloft gives me the motivation to use the skills I'm learning in dbt, where as before, I'd recognize myself in a mood swing and want to stay there. Zoloft is my 4th antidepressant and the only one that's worked for me!"
TwoXChromosomes,f5l9h5r,t1_f5jzfdq,1572275720.0,Yes!! Have you been tested for PCOS? Or just had your hormones tested at all? I was just diagnosed last week with PCOS so I'm new to it but there are medications available for unwanted hair growth and natural ways to balance hormones that can reduce hair growth as well.
iih,f5c7a1s,t1_f5bwlau,1572131157.0,Please keep me updated! Since the progestin in Yaz is class 4 and anti androgenic (unlike the one in nexplanon which is class 2 and highly androgenic) so there's a fighting chance it'll work!
iih,f59eka1,t1_f595ixa,1572086085.0,I'm really sorry to hear your struggles but I appreciate you sharing. I've been looking into magnesium and inositol supplements to normalize hormones... maybe you can look into adding them to metformin? But your advice/experience is super validating and now I'm more confident the Yasmin is gonna help me. Thanks!!
iih,f57y0rl,t1_f57v9ss,1572045184.0,Thanks so much!
iih,f57iv43,t1_f57h1qx,1572036882.0,"Oh gosh my heart broke for all those women who had essure complications. People assume they can trust their doctors...I'm glad mirena removal has helped you!!! I hope it continues to get better for you. It's good to know it takes several months...I just got my nexplanon out 2 weeks ago and was disappointed to still be having double vision. I just need to decide if I wanna start yasmin now or let my hormones level out a bit, although who knows if that even means anything with pcos haha"
iih,f57e5u0,t1_f57deik,1572034862.0,Omg the bleeding edge was horrifying!!! And I feel like we have to advocate for ourselves extra hard as women.
iih,f56tvaf,t1_f56n8h2,1572027625.0,"Hmm that's a good idea. I think I'm gonna try my hypothesis with Yasmin first because I'm at a point in my life where I want contraception, but I will look into that if the Yasmin screws with my IIH. Thanks!"
iih,f56mdmp,t1_f56lxz8,1572025007.0,"Oh I totally agree! At the time I transitioned from Mirena to Nexplanon, I did not link them to the IIH...only afterwards when I did my own reading did I realize this. In fact, my first Neuro Op told me there's no way the Mirena caused it because it would have happened immediately after getting the Mirena! It's definitely not fun having some diseases that are poorly researched."
PCOS,f56643c,t1_f55tcls,1572019076.0,Thanks!! I think I have it easier than a lot of people in terms of symptoms but it was still a shock for me to hear.
