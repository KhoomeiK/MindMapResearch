AskReddit,fp3njfi,t3_gb3g5h,1588282452.0,"Story time! In October of 2017, I lost my supposed best friend (who was actually very emotionally abusive). He knew everything about me and I him. We were inseparable for years. Every time we drifted away, we still came back to each other. But in Oct of 2017 he felt that we finally had completely grown apart, but I was in total denial. I felt like I needed him or I wouldn’t survive (bc he told me I wouldn’t survive without him lol). He said it’s time we just find different friends. I didn’t argue, but god it hurt. It was like losing a limb. From then until February of 2018, things spiraled downward fast. My friends moved away from campus, my grades sunk because the material was confusing and I was too low to try, my cat died, my ex best friend wanted nothing to do with me, and I was facing constant rejection. One night while laying in my dorm bed, I realized I had nothing and no one. It hit hard. My parents wouldn’t even take it seriously when I said I wanted to withdraw until the next semester. I was emotionally stranded. I decided I was better off gone. No one needed me. I climbed up on the top floor of my dorm parking deck and decided that was it. I even tried to tell my ex best friend who replied with “Good luck.” And that was the most pain I’ve ever been in emotionally. 

Luckily I didn’t do anything and I got therapy! I’m doing so much better! I have friends who love me, school is going great, and I found someone who loves and wants me for me. My therapist kicks ass too. I just don’t want to ever feel that low again. That was my rock bottom."
unpopularopinion,foyh7lt,t1_foygkml,1588172468.0,"I didn't. Because I was solely focused on therapy and undoing the trauma my exes put in me. Boys were the least of my worries. My mind worked like this at the time: ""Everyone is going to leave you. Everyone is going to give up on you. No one will ever love you."" So that stopped me from dating. I wasn't ready. My brain was terrified of being abused again. I DID try once and it ended quickly because I kept panicking because of abandonment issues thinking they'd constantly leave me and he basically said I was too much to handle. That's where I decided I wasn't ready. I finally felt ready last fall where I met my current boyfriend."
