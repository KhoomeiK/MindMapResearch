AmItheAsshole,fr54rhx,t3_gmmlv7,1589902487.0,"YTA! I was a chunky kid my whole life and my parents were alllll about love your body eat what you want and didn't teach me healthy eating or exercise and you know what that led to? AN EATING DISORDER. Your sister is encouraging moderation, vegetables, and exercise.... wtf about that seems bad to you??? You're threatened by the thought of your daughter proving what your sister did, that it's not biology making you fat, it's bad habits."
JustNoSO,fqy3gvu,t3_gkso7f,1589741973.0,"Oh man.. I'm so sorry you're going through this. First off I want to preface this story with 1- I fully believe men CAN be assaulted by women. And 2- him being the boss makes this complicated... that being said this is MY experience where my ex was completely lying about every aspect of that and I was completely in the fog of love until years later. Our stories are so similar I just had to comment.


When I was with my ex together 2 years at the time... he cheated on me while drunk. He was ""black out drunk"" and ""didn't want it to happen they just had sex"" he felt so bad he didnt tell me about it for 3 weeks and then when he did he deleted all the texts and messages. The girl he cheated on me with was a girl I had warned him was interested in him and asked him to avoid. He said he ""deleted the messages because he didnt want me to blame him for the assault"" I would NEVER and was horrified when he told me this happened. Instantly got so mad at this girl believed him and got a bunch of our friends to cut this girl off as well. (College she was a mutual friend)

He then was like - well I still want to be friends with her (wait what?) Because I feel guilty, shes telling me shes so sad and sorry it's a big mistake and misunderstanding and if you cant let me process my assault how i need to then you're not supporting me or dont believe I was assaulted you think I cheated. (!!!????!!!) She was also drunk when it happened so it turned into he was so sad bc maybe she made a mistake was just also black out drunk and didnt mean to rape him and now was losing friends bc of this. (In actuality they just both cheated- she knew he had a gf and now he felt guilty all her friends were cutting her off for this bc he had told her that I would never find out but he got a guilty conscious. She threatened to tell me the truth and this was his covering his ass)


Moral of the story... if it seems like you're getting a bunch of stuff leaked out to you over time and the story is changing then perhaps he is worried this girl is going to say something to you and hes covering his ass. OR things are coming to light he needs to explain away with more lies. This was my experience when I was cheated on by an alcoholic asshole. Dont be like me. I spent 3 more years with the asshole. I say, tell him that if he is the boss and a subordinate sexually assaulted him he needs to file a complaint with HR. There are so many potential lawsuits... just get ahead of it...a rational person will be like ""babe you're totally right there is footage of it and everything. And now she continues to harass me I'm going to do it or leave my job"" if he is cheating and trying to cover it up then the lies or excuses are just going to fly out of his ass and get even more elaborate"
AmItheAsshole,fqwz829,t3_gl44vl,1589721871.0,"NTA. My biomom will never see my kids and anyone who tries to argue with me on it can kick rocks. Sometimes people who havent experienced the betrayal of someone who is innately supposed to care for you treating you in such a deplorable way think anything is forgivable but that just isn't true. Sometimes you need to put yourself and your children first to ensure they never feel that betrayal. Those cuts don't heal the same as others do. 

Take care and congratulations on your new family, xoxo."

Couple that with body dysmorphia and it's a wild ride. Other people tell me all the time I look great now but I stare in the mirror and only see what I used to look like. My husband also loves when I can't eat for days because none of the food in the house is a ""safe"" food. Especially with the stores the way they are now we are trying to only shop every two weeks so I'll eat all the foods in the first few days and then nothing for the last week it seems like... ahsheiewkmfusmal.

But she didnt magically change in the last 39 weeks it seems like your both just dealing with baby stress, quarantine stress and boredom. A puppy does have needs though but right now understandably your wife's priority should be herself and the baby 1st. Seems like she impulsively got the dog and realized her mistake and is trying to remedy that before your child comes to keep the house as low stress as possible for both of you. You're trying to force her to keep a living thing as a punishment to change who she is as a person..... DUDE.  now is not the time for that and the puppy and the baby shouldn't have to deal with the fall out that are gonna come from this ultimatum. Find the dog an amazing loving home, make that her responsibility. Then moving forward discuss and set limits for her impulsivness."

Dogtraining,fp9xlax,t3_gc7oyq,1588436650.0,"I think our pup went through the same around this age. She was just learning her body's ""gotta go"" rhythm. We would wait until she stopped whining, then reward the quiet with a walk. We were already up anyway and figured she was awake because she had to go potty. It was just a matter of waiting until the whining and barking stopped. Then we would usually leave her out of the crate after that first walk. Since she had gone potty and let out some wiggles she would usually settle back down for another hour or so until breakfast."

Even if you never expressed those feelings to her directly I'm sure she felt them the same way its showing under your words in this post. Maybe you only see what's going on with Mike so well because only he feels comfortable sharing that with you because of the bond you two have and that's great. It also seems like Elise has that bond with your new wife. RESPECT YOUR WIFE'S OPINION. She isn't coddling her she has more insight that you."

If anything I would be upset with my SO for making such an upsetting moment about them too.

relationships,fou8dz7,t3_g9iddw,1588078768.0,"When my husband and I first started dating I was lying to everyone about having graduated from college. It was a white lie in my mind. I was 3 credits shy, my school had let me walk the stage and the only reason I hadn't gone back was because of finances. I was too proud to admit that I didn't actually have the degree yet. 

The longer I put off telling him the bigger the lie got. The less it seemed like a white lie and the more it seemed like I was deliberating deceiving the man I wanted to someday marry. I was terrified if I told him he would think less of me; not only for not telling him at first but also for being dumb enough to get myself into the situation. But I knew that I couldnt let our relationship continue to build on the lie if if was going to go anywhere real. I told him the truth and he was shocked but he understood where I was coming from and surprisingly calm about the whole thing. He thanked me for telling him the truth and asked how he could help me. If I wanted to go back and when I said I did he promised we would make that happen. It took about a year but he helped me get my degree and I did marry him <3. 

All I'm trying to say is you never know how someone's going to respond until you give then the chance. And the relief you get from that honesty is so worth it. It even gave me the courage to come clean to the rest of my family and friends. Changed a lot about the way I was living my life. If your boyfriend only loves you for where he thinks you went to school, only measures your intelligence for that? Then maybe he isn't the right one and the truth will set you free in a different way but I don't think that's the case. <3 trust that you picked a good man who may need some time to adjust to the deception at first but then will remember all the reasons he loves you. Just explain the why behind the lie and make a promise to him and yourself to change the way you try to impress others. My guess is he never really cared about the college to begin with."

AmItheAsshole,fohad90,t1_fog2uuw,1587762668.0,"So, a bit of personal experience here. No- YWNBTA. My mother stole about 10k from me in CC debt when I was younger. I did not pursue legal action and instead went no contact with her for other hostile things she had done to me through out our relationship but I always regretted that. I used not pressing charges as my justification in my mind for why it was ok to walk away and not feel guilty. Downsides? I was personally responsible for 10k worth of debt at 20 years old. My credit was trashed and I had to rebuild it and auto places and other cc lenders dont care that mom was the one who defaulted on their cards. Not unless you are pressing charges. You're on the hook for that money and the hit on your credit.  RUN A FREE CREDIT CHECK (with all 3 agencies)  if you havent already. I'm hopeful that's how you've found this loan but just in case there are store cards, airline cards or something else out there away from your bank. You'd be surprised where a motivated person can open a card. I also froze my credit because I didnt plan to open anything for a while. Another option is changing your SSN but with the freeze and going no contact I didnt need to do that but it's a option you may want to consider."

You're literally trying to tell this poor girl that her faith is only acceptable to her if she shuts the fuck up about it and holes up in her room. You say you're an atheist so... it's not like shes going against some god you believe in. She's not forcing you to pray with her shes decorating a room you don't go into and asking for the candles and a virtual dinner with her family/virtual community one day a week. Woman up and let this poor girl celebrate her faith in the place you told her to make herself at home. Or are you really trying to tell someone you invited to live with you they only have access to one room of your home because it offends your delicate sensibilities?
JUSTNOFAMILY,fly7d4j,t3_frro5n,1585596895.0,"Ugh I'm so sorry you're going through this. I too took money from my bio monster for a while as a ""restitution"" of sorts. She never paid child support to my dad and did so much damage to me I didnt feel guilty taking the money and remaining no contact. She had stolen not only my childhood but also money at times.

Remember NO- is a complete sentence. Anytime they bring up the talking to your parents thing just keep saying no- you dont have to keep justifying it you have already explained.

Also- remember that you can respect your FFIL and still disagree with him. ""If you want to involve yourself with my mother and father I cant stop you, but I removed them from my life for a reason. If my being under your roof and taking their money makes you uncomfortable then out of respect for you I will stop taking their money but I will not let someone who hurt me for years with no regard for me back into my life because of your beliefs."" Then just end the conversation and find something else to talk about.

<3 wishing you the best."

CPTSD,flp6ey9,t3_fq89dl,1585352613.0,"I'm so sorry you went through all that. :( *hugs* if you take them. A lot of people are reaching out now because of everything going on. Some are stuck inside realizing mistakes they've made and some are bored looking to reach out and stir the pot. Take some breaths and remember you don't owe her a response on her terms. The good thing about a message vs a phone call is you can take a shower, try to call a friend, read a book to decompress if you can. Do whatever soothes you for a few moments. Try to center before you respond, just take care of yourself for a bit and then deal with this message. This could be a chance to speak to your siblings again or it could be an attempt at manipulating. I'm sorry for the stress in the tough times whatever it may be, an olive branch or a distraction for her while she is trapped inside. Wishing you the best."

AmItheAsshole,fl5tjs1,t3_fmiq1t,1584845332.0,"NTA my dad tried SO hard my whole childhood to give my mom opportunities to step up and get her shit together so she could be in my life. He bent over backwards and put himself at a disadvantage. In the end you need to take care of yourself first. She is your ex now and needs to learn to take care of herself when times get hard and not rely on you. That means learning to pull herself up when things get hard and hopefully become the mother your kids need who gets her license, gets a savings account, and gets some lifelines other than her exhusband."
AmItheAsshole,fl5s7x9,t3_fmivyj,1584844362.0,NTA! My family was awful about guilting into signs of affection. You're teaching your kid that people guilting them doesn't mean they get to physically impose themselves onto your son when it makes him uncomfortable. That is a great lesson to learn.

AmItheAsshole,fkc7s82,t1_fk9mbjm,1584047477.0,"Agree! I can't even wrap my head around how you thought this was appropriate. Puberty is such a bitch. Why would you force your step daughter to go through that in tight quarters with her brothers and think That wouldnt lead to more bullying? Sharing a room- if done right can be a bonding experience. Buy the girls their own wonderful furniture. Get them a nice room divider like this https://www.roomdividers.com/CAN-KLIMT4AB.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=adwords&adtype=&kw=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwu6fzBRC6ARIsAJUwa2TNDQeyjRY08HeZh-EIHkvnWYSBHbHBBmprH_gK2udVrNIpreeGEmwaAic8EALw_wcB ... that took me like two minutes I'm sure you can help the girls design a room to their liking. 

Doing this together can be something fun for them that gets them on a team against the boys. Once shes got an ally in the siblings she will be less of a victim of bullying but stepdad has GOT to give consequences for the bullying... that's what makes him TA."
whatsthisbird,fk6z8zv,t3_fguvd6,1583922431.0,I know you asked about a guide book but personally I love the Audubon app. Free and lots of ways to purchase additional education from them if you want. They have places where you can store your sightings in your phone or tablet as well and sync your findings with other birders. It's also got great identification tools.
TwoXChromosomes,fk6yhyo,t1_fk6gxx9,1583921609.0,":( my ex used to say I was ""too wet"" whenever I enjoyed sex and that it ""grossed him out"" it fucked up my sex life for a long time after I left him. You don't deserve that even if you two decide not to be sexual with eachother he shouldn't make you feel shame for your body. Turns out he just wanted things I couldnt give him. Seems like maybe your husband does too. 

From me to you. --> my ex used to shift the blame to me because he didn't want to deal with the shame of his premature ejaculation or when he lost his erections. That was his shame... not mine and you shouldn't be ashamed of your body or of enjoying sex either. <3"
TwoXChromosomes,fk6xrrn,t1_fk6tr89,1583920795.0,"Sometimes girls have been trained to say- ""oh no its fine just keep going... it'll stop hurting eventually...."" and the guys are like ""oh okay if you say so!"" Or they simply think that sex just kinda hurts a bit for women because they have been taught that. Unfortunately sex has long been taboo for a lot of cultures like super religious or just super conservative so they don't talk about how sex should be. It's for procreation only and the kids arent really educated about it so when the guys start having sex they are just doing what feels good and the girls don't want to disappoint or talk about stuff that's considered ""improper"". 

Idk if that's always the case but for me it was this and and a first partner generally inconsiderate of my needs who kinda ""groomed me"". The guys after him I slept with before my husband weren't bad men, they just took my word for it when I told them not to worry about it. It wasnt like I asked them to stop or was crying. It wasnt until my husband was like- wtf no if it hurts at all I'm stopping completely that things changed for me."
TwoXChromosomes,fk6x8t5,t1_fk6p218,1583920186.0,"Agree with the below MissJinx - that's not how it has to be. After staying with the guy I lost my virginity to for 4 years because I believed that was ""what you did"" and living with sometimes painful and sometimes mildly fulfilling sex I'm now married to a different man who actually cares about my pleasure and will full on STOP sex if I'm hurting. You can find a man like that even if the trauma still lingers. Don't give up"

AmItheAsshole,fjwnxq6,t1_fjta0pu,1583641797.0,So weirdly true. I once had a roommate that would eat three day old unrefrigerated pizza. I didn't get it... but I didn't eat her pizza and she kept it hidden in the microwave so it worked haha

AmItheAsshole,fjwjnug,t3_ff4192,1583639976.0,YTA.  You knew how your family was. You sister and therapist even had said that your parents were who put you into competition looooong ago. You and your sister agreed to make up and put this aside. You let the pregnancy slip to your dad who you kinda knew would do this. You could have lied and corrected it later to avoid the drama. One sip of champagne will not hurt a baby- held in your mouth even if you are that paranoid. You could have found a way. On a subconscious level or at least that's how your sister is perceiving it and she deserves an apology bc you turned the wedding into everything you two were trying to move past.
AmItheAsshole,fjos1jo,t3_fedmq2,1583533706.0,"YTA. I don't necessarily think you're homophobic, but I also don't think you handled the situation appropriately. Instead I think you should have messaged the friend you were bunking with directly. Bro- talk about your feelings before you lose your friends lol 

""Hey- I'm SUPER weird about bed sharing. I should have made arrangements before this trip happened and that's totally my fault. I have a lot of sexual hang ups I guess. I never really considered how that would factor in with your sexuality bc honestly I never think about the fact that you like guys when it comes to our friendship. You are first and foremost my friend. But when it comes to being in a bed with someone... man woman.... I get kinda weird when I think about us sleeping next to each other and sexual attraction. I wouldnt sleep next to a girl either. 

Honestly I think you're in the wrong and need to do some work on yourself and owe your friend an apology"
AskReddit,fjhf47w,t3_fdbdik,1583346898.0,I hit a man on a bicycle with my car. I cried for 4 hours. He was fine and livid I wanted to call the police or an ambulance. I guess not so close to killing him in his mind but terrifyingly close for me!

AmItheAsshole,fj6s37k,t3_fbruyq,1583078948.0,Nta- you were the family scape goat as a kid and now as the family scape goat the cancer is your fault. Her lack of recovery will probably be your fault too. I've had a lot of experience with this family dynamic. When they arent able to accept any kind of responsibility for their actions they HAVE to shift the blame to someone and it's a lot easier to fall back into old patterns. Its sucks that it's you. Its not fair and you dont deserve it at all but your mom and your sisters are trying to cope with her illness how they were taught. That doesn't mean you need to put up with it. Just go back to cutting them off. Try not to take how your gf is feeling too harshly. People from normal families dont always understand how much hurt we can hold inside for our mothers so they think we are assholes for treating them this way but refusing to help someone to hurt you is OK even if they are your mom.
ptsd,fhclrzn,t3_f2e7wb,1581465597.0,"When you're feeling overwhelmed look at people's eyebrows when they're talking to you and focus in on the individual hairs like it's a mindfulness exercise. I agree with grounding exercises. I like breathing in a square and holding ice like was mentioned. I also find as many colors in the room as I can and try to beak it down further by sub color. 

""I am here, I am now, nothing bad is happening in this moment, come back to here and now"" I wear a particular ring I twist too to ground myself.

Have a five minute signal to coworkers. Holding up a finger or something that just says silently - don't talk to me or interact with me for a second or I'm going to freak out. Ideally this will also explain a quick need to run to the bathroom or step outside for a second if you need to but I'm usually frozen if I'm in a flashback but everyones different. 

If you don't want to explain it as PTSD to coworkers I've said before sometimes I get waves of nausea I'm trying to fight so I need to stay silent and not be talked to for a few minutes in the corner."
AmItheAsshole,fh8330k,t3_f1iwy0,1581350944.0,YTA. You're wearing moisturizer because you want to look younger longer and sunscreen is a sure fire way to do that. Your GF is looking out for you and you're an idiot whose probably going to end up wrinkled faster if you stop this on principle. You said yourself you feel better doing it her way. You sound like you don't want to admit she knows more than you on this subject.
AskReddit,fh58ddh,t3_f18upu,1581286130.0,My brother killed himself 3 years ago and it ruined our family for a while. I can't put them through that again. When he did it I was quite close to suicide myself at the time and I put myself into inpatient not too long after. I consider myself passively suicidal now.

relationships,fgye8kd,t1_fgy50rf,1581182423.0,"You keep saying ""dumb jokes that arent as bad"" I think you might just be deluding yourself a bit. But setting that aside. If you arent making the same jokes that's nice but sitting silently by and telling the girls that it's better for them to do the same it is still supporting it. You should stand up to injustices not ignore them. Especially if you aren't the one being put down."
relationships,fgxqdnv,t3_f0sduv,1581175623.0,"So, you live with two misogynists who are pretty open about their opinions. They make jokes about their beliefs, and sometimes I bet they can even seem a little funny at times if you don't think too hard about what's layered beneath them. The more you're  around this type of person the more comfortable they get publicizing their views. 


I'm sure that once these girls moved in the more frequently they started making them and the more obnoxious they seemed. At first they thought you weren't like them, probably they even thought living with them might not be so bad because you would call them out on the bullshit if it moved past the jokes into flat out insulting them. But then they realized that you wouldn't. In fact you were going to laugh along and even make your own jokes. That probably sucked for them but instead of making the situation more awkward they just avoid you all. Call a spade a spade and own your shit. If I were them I wouldn't want to be your friend either. I would ignore you, keep it civil, finish my lease, and GTFO and not talk to any of you ever again."
relationships,fgxnueh,t3_f0slt9,1581174775.0,"My first thought with that comment would be that he meant adoption or abortion not that he was thinking of leaving. Perhaps some underlying insecurities are coming up and making you default to the thought of him leaving because of your ex? Emotions were high in the moment and instead of going straight to him you went to a friend. That never helps the situation. You guys weren't planning on kids so it seems okay that his immediate response wasnt ""yay- let's raise this kid together"" that's not to say he wouldn't have changed his mind but you'll never know unless you talk to him."
