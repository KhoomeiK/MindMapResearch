It sounds like you have the beginnings of a wonderful relationship with this girl! Thats great! As for the gift basket, remember the most important gift you’re giving her is your heart, so maybe a representation of that? A stuffed heart perhaps? Also you can’t go wrong with flowers. And maybe throw in something rainbow cuz gay.

You got this, now go sweep her off her feet! ✊"
relationship_advice,fqokr11,t3_gk1f0c,1589517554.0,"No sexual preference is wrong (except, like, pedophilia obv), but I think that it would do a lot of people some good to examine the sexual preferences they have and figure out why they have them and if they have a root cause thats also bleeding into their non-sexual relationships. Like in your case maybe subconsciously treating women with sexual pasts with less respect, because that would be wrong."
mypartneristrans,folhfvz,t3_g83vgj,1587862303.0,"First of all, being scared is completely normal and expected. This is a big change for all involved, with a lot of uncertainties. Never, ever feel ashamed because of your fear. It’s how you act on that fear that really counts.

With that being said, you have a lot of reasons to be optimistic! Unlike a lot of people who’re in your situation, you have no conflict of orientation. And you clearly love your partner very dearly. I’m not going to say that they won’t change at all, but we all change honey, cis or trans. Doesn’t mean they aren’t the same person at the end of it all. 

In regards to your parents: they aren’t dating your parents, they’re dating YOU. What your parents say and do may hurt them, yes, but the only thing that’s important is what you say and do in response. Will you defend your partner to your parents? Stand up for them even when they aren’t in the room? Be willing to accept that doing so might harm or even destroy your relationship with your parents, but decide that the love of your life matters more? My point is, your partner wont stay or leave based on what your parents do, they’ll stay or leave based on what YOU do.

You got this sister, we’re all rooting for you ✊"
mypartneristrans,fo9cv2c,t3_g656qo,1587616102.0,"I’m going to offer a bit of a dissenting opinion here and say that you should definitely tell him. Personally as a trans person one of the worst, most hurtful things that someone did to me was tell someone else and then neither of them telling me that those people knew for years. Being outed is one thing, but knowing that the entire time you were standing there talking to them they knew your biggest secret and you had no idea is agonizing and beyond embarrassing. Ofc he’s going to be disappointed he couldn’t come out to you on his own but he’s going to be disappointed and embarrassed when he does come out and you don’t act surprised, unless you DO act surprised which is even worse because you’ll be lying on top of everything.

So ya. You should tell him. You’ve been put in a shitty position no matter what but at least thats the least-shitty option."
relationships,fnq8bu9,t3_g395me,1587159623.0,"I’m not sure there’s much that you personally can do hon. It sounds like your mother is finally tired of dealing with your asshole father and your father is reaping what he sowed. I think a divorce is definitely the best thing for her and for the family in general.

Now, and I must stress this is dependent on the type of country you live in, I don’t think your mother will end up as financially destitute as you think. Again, assuming your country works similarly to how mine does, divorce law is made to specifically protect people in situations like these. She’ll be entitled to a sizable portion of their shared assets for all the work she did raising you two and maintaining the families home. The fact that she’s part of your father’s company may also be taken into account (she might even be given a portion of ownership over that company).

So for you I would support your mom in this trying time, help her connect with reputable lawyers in your country and get their advice on the topic. Be prepared for your Dad to escalate into potentially full-on abuse because of his bruised ego. Be there for your little brother and reassure him that in the end mom and dad will be much happier with them at each other’s throats.

I hope this all works out for you. Stay strong brother ✊"
relationships,fnj278x,t3_g21ik6,1586990579.0,"Honestly? I think you would be much better off in a mental health hospital right now than with these vile, vile people. You’re showing early signs of developing PTSD, and understandably so, and how soon after your trauma you seek professional help makes a big difference in your healing process and quality of life. Also, as someone who lost the person most dear to me, I know memories are malleable and fragile. The absolute LAST thing you need is your parents distorting and breaking all the good, happy memories your fiancee has left you to remember her by.

So checking yourself into a reputable (make sure you do your research) inpatient program might be exactly what you need. You get some time alone from your parents to grieve and you have professionals who can help you through the process, with no pressure to work or get better on a certain timetable.

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Stay strong sister ✊"

I don’t know your wife, so this is all speculation on my part. But she could be frustrated and jealous of the relationship you get to have with your kids. She isn’t allowed to be “mom” because of something she had no control over, and is the thing she hates most about herself, but yet she’s expected to treat the children like she’s mom. I could see how she would find that incredibly unfair and frustrating. In fact I personally plan to adopt any children I have to avoid this exact scenario because I know it’d emotionally wreck me (which might very well mean I’m projecting here lol). Again, not an excuse for treating children poorly, just my take."
mypartneristrans,fng51bi,t3_g1jznm,1586922488.0,"I’m not going to touch on the attractiveness issue, except that that’s something that you’re only going to find an answer for through introspection. But mayyybe part of it might come from her recent behavior and not her genitals. Speaking of that behavior: everything I’m about to say is not an excuse, there’s no excuse for acting cruelly towards a child, but it is a possible reason for the behavior which can help you guide how you deal with it.

The first year of transition is hormonal hell. It’s basically a second puberty internally combined with expectations and pressures of adulthood and transitioning externally. It’s a LOT to deal with and it’s an open secret in the trans community that trans women in their first year are...difficult to be friends with, let alone partners or family with. Having to navigate all that while being a mother? It’s sadly not surprising to me that she’s misbehaving. But it does get better after the first year, by a lot. However its not fair to ask the children to “be patient” with their mother while she borderline abuses them.

I would suggest sitting down with her (separate from any talks about the future of your relationship) and make it very clear that while you respect and understand what she’s going through, it is unacceptable to take those negative feelings out on the children. Find some sort of outlet that she can use to release her pent-up emotional instability on, something that she can excuse herself to go do easily when she’s getting overwhelmed. And keep that activity separate from the children.

I hope this all helps. Good luck sister ✊"

relationship_advice,fmtk2gq,t3_fx5e7d,1586374069.0,I’m going to give an alternative viewpoint that’ll prob get buried but whatever. I think that your gf has every right to want to be completely out with her relationship just like you have every right to hide it from your aunt. Usually when both partners in a queer relationship are at a different level of “out” its just a fundamental incompatibility. Sure it might be “rational” to hide it from your aunt but you can’t rationalize away your gfs feelings about the situation. She might have very deep-seated reasons for wanting to be out just like you have deep-seated reasons for wanting to be closeted. I wouldn’t blame her if she broke up with you over this.

Bipolar disorder:

A) doesn’t make you forget the things you did or absolve you of responsibility for them

B) doesn’t cause quick bursts of anger in periods of normalcy (for a diagnoses of bipolar, mood swings need to last consistently for WEEKS before swinging back)

Blitz isn’t really picked in high elos, precisely because he’s just a hookbot. And Naut and Thresh provide things other than their hook. Also the point of having a hook in high elos isn’t necessarily to hit it, because the enemies will rarely let you get an angle to hit them, but to have the THREAT of hitting them forcing your enemies to play defensively.

If a blitz is in a brush BEHIND you that means you pushed the lane against him. Which is why you get hooked. Proper wave control is your friend.

You know what else is your friend? The mute button. You should try it sometime. You’ll play much better."
leagueoflegends,fmmdvgc,t1_fmmd4bj,1586203500.0,"Well she can’t block leona or alistar cc even if she wanted to (leona jumps to the last person hit, and alistar is aoe), blitz’s hook is a pretty fast skillshot for a yuumi player to A) see coming and B) Calculate that her adc fucked up and is getting hit by it fast enough to jump off and block it. And getting hit by nautilus without ult means you were most definitely out of position (arguably same with blitzcrank too). In fact avoiding hook champions is, like, the first thing you should learn as an adc main.

leagueoflegends,fmmc3jl,t1_fmmbcah,1586202605.0,"Well, theoretically, if I’m stacking up a dark seal, and my adc has been inting so they give less gold, I shouldn’t die for them.

And my point is that staying on them gives a higher chance for us both to live. Plus if we’re in a position where getting hit by 1 cc leads to death then not only did the adc just “accidentally eat a cc” it means we have to be either seriously overstaying or out of position. Both of which would indeed be the adcs fault.... That or we’re up against a competent Caitlyn Morgana lane in which case oh man we’re kinda fucked no matter what we do.

You’re forgetting that Yuumi does a lot more for the adc when she’s on them than just ‘heal+q’. She gives shields as well, an adaptive bonus to damage, and a not insignificant buff to attack speed with her E. Plus if she’s still alive because she didn’t “just block the cc” she can block higher-damage abilities that WONT instantly kill her like EZ Qs or Jinx zappers.

Your basically saying that Yuumi should literally int to save her adc from their inting."

As for the stay-at-home order, you can still go out for essential things, and this is pretty damn essential. No one is going to, like, arrest you for going to visit him. Just be very careful when your in the hospital, practice social distancing, wear masks if you can, all that fun stuff.

Rather than just demanding that she tell you you should just be there for her without putting that on her. If she doesn’t want to talk about her problems, thats fine, ask her what she DOES want to talk about. Thats how you really get to understanding.

You also need to try to decouple your self-worth from how much she shares with you. The fact that she has a hard time opening up probably has nothing to do with you personally. By putting pressure on her to do so you aren’t actually understanding her at all.

That was an exceptionally rude and insensitive thing to say to her and you should apologize. 3) Using you as her emotional punching bag is absolutely not fair to you at all and absolutely is a behavior she needs to change. 4) On the other hand. I think you maybe get too ‘invested’ when she gets worked up. You need to establish a bit of mental distance, a “this isn’t really her, it’s the illness talking, I just need to wait it out” sort of attitude.

Candace was adopted by a woman like your wife who expected her new child to be affectionate and loving and obedient, like a new puppy.

A shortcut to a loving mother-daughter relationship with none of the work involved.

Candace Newmaker died during one of those sessions. The therapists tried to “simulate the birthing process” by suffocating her under a blanket held down by several adults.

She needs to evaluate what part of her support network is failing her and causing her to relapse. Is she not on the right medication?

That being established I do have Bipolar disorder and have experience with SSRIs.

Here is the thing: SSRI’s are good for unipolar depression. But they usually aren’t recommended on their own for bipolar patients, as they often trigger extreme (hypo)mania. In fact I got my diagnoses after taking Lexapro and going absolutely bonkers.

(Hypo)mania is often characterized by impulsive decision making and overconfidence. Does she see her prescriber (primary care doctor or psychiatrist, NOT her therapist) regularly? This is definitely cause for concern, but not panic. I would encourage her to talk to her doctor about maybe trying mood stabilizers  and/or anti-psychotics either in addition to or instead of her SSRIs.

Either way, molly is a baaaaaaaad idea and you should take every avenue you can to discourage her from taking it for her own safety. But if she is (hypo)manic there might not be much you can do on your own."

relationships,fgg18r6,t1_fgfnrko,1580752045.0,"I second this advice and can add some personal experience from it. I, like your mother, have bipolar disorder (although I have type 2 and from your description it sounds like she may have type 1) and it caused me to lose my job about half a year ago during a long, arduous spiral. Now that I’m on the mend again, instead of jumping straight back into employment and potentially setting my disease back off again with the sudden stress, I’ve taken a volunteering opportunity with a cause I’m passionate about. Its been great for me to get out of the house and “practice” working without the same expectations (as well as giving me stuff to put on my resume for when I am ready to get back to work).

Something else you might consider is that the lethargy could be a side-effect of the medication. I take anti-psychotics and they make me suuuuuper drowsy all day. Obviously I’m still more functional then I was before the meds, but its still a bit annoying.

Lastly do you guys have any pets? Animals can be great for those with mental illness who are still functional enough to take care of them. They put you on a routine as well as keep you from 100% isolating yourself. I recently adopted two furbabies and they’ve helped just as much as the medication."

relationship_advice,fg3yfk1,t3_ewqfs0,1580492331.0,"So I’m gonna preface my advice with this: if you aren’t happy and want to end it, you should. It doesn’t matter why or if its a good reason or not. Full stop if you want to end it then you can end it.

That being said there’s a lot to unpack here. Coloring everything is that the first year or so of transitioning is going to be possibly the most emotionally turbulent time of your girlfriend’s life (especially as it coincides with crossing the threshold into adulthood. Again if you can’t handle that then there’s no shame in leaving, but if you want to stay then you need to have some patience with her while she gets her life together.

I think also snapping at her when she was trying to communicate with you in the best way she could was unfair and probably very hurtful. I myself have trouble being verbal sometimes (during panic attacks for me but the point still stands) and it would be crushing if my partner snapped at me that way. Maybe in those situations in the future you could use pen and paper or text each other? I know it might be annoying to you at first but I can guarantee you’ll get much better, more open conversations then forcing your girlfriend to be verbal when she isn’t in a good state to be.

As far as your grabby ‘friend’ your girlfriend definitely needs to grow a pair of ovaries and stand up to him...but so does the rest of your friend group. Just talking amongst yourselves about how uncomfortable you all are isn’t going to change shit. And if people have tried to speak to him and he hasn’t changed his behavior.....well then why is he still getting invites?

Anyway I hope it works out between you two. You seem like a good kid whose maybe a teensy bit overwhelmed right now. But I think you’ll be okay. Good luck sister ✊🏳️‍🌈"

That being said, I think in the future (after giving both of you ample time to grieve this recent loss) if you want to have a relationship with her you two should really talk about how the way she treats you makes you feel. If she really loves you the way she says she does she’d want to know the effect her actions were having on you. And at the very least it’d clear the air."
relationship_advice,fff6y5d,t3_et97qm,1579877275.0,"Honestly if your sister is as constantly suicidal and depressed as she claims to be then she really really REALLY needs some kind of professional help. Which is unfortunate if your country really doesn’t have mental health resources. If medical doctors where you are are overall competent and take mental health seriously they might be able to help in prescribing medication at the very least. If that isn’t an option and you have the money then there are American agencies that offer therapy services through video and/or voice chat. Ultimately though the best thing for her may be to move to a country with better medical care.

If none of those are options, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, then there are (questionably legal) websites online that you can use to order medication without a prescription. Normally I’d never recommend self-medication but in a case like this, if there really is no other option, then the benefit likely outweighs the risk. This will require a lot of work on both your parts to do the research necessary to self-prescribe as safely as you possibly can. 

I hope everything works out for you. Remember, major depression is an illness, and needs to be treated like one if you want your sister to recover."

relationship_advice,feifo4z,t3_epbo19,1579137428.0,"okay I don’t want to arm-chair psychoanalyze here...except thats totally what I’m going to do. To me it sounds like your sister is dealing with mental illness and hiding it from the rest of you. I think this because honestly aside from some of the details you could totally have been talking about me from not that long ago.

I’ve struggled with mental illness for most of my adult life, but after some bad experiences with the mental health system, and my dysfunctional brain messing with my decision making, I heavily resisted getting the help I needed. I ended up losing my job and pushing away my family members because I couldn’t stand the guilt of making them worry about me (obv they were even more worried about me because I kept ignoring their calls but I wasn’t being rational). The only person I’d talk to was my father, and only to ask for money so I wouldn’t starve...and even sometimes I’d put that off.

Thankfully I’m in treatment now (Bipolar 2, whoohoo) and I’m repairing my relationship to my family. I’m still not back to normal but with their support I’m getting there.

My, perhaps long-winded, point is that isolating yourself from friends and family member, withdrawing from society completely, attaching yourself to people who aren’t healthy for you. Those are clear indicators of serious mental illness (or abuse), healthy people don’t do things like that for such a long time with no obvious trigger. So she needs you now more than ever. Maybe try to stage an intervention with your family? Try to convince her to talk to her primary care physician and/or go to therapy? It’ll be hard to help her if she doesn’t want help, maybe impossible, but I wish you luck anyway."

I definitely recommend that you seek out other queer people, especially older lesbians and bisexual women, who’ve been through this before.

Contacting your local PFLAG chapter or LGBT center is a fantastic way to start.

It’s just a serious emotional drain to ask your partner to sneak around when she’s used to being out and proud. It leads to resentment, hurt feelings, and low self-esteem over time.

I highly recommend that you find a way to speed up the timeline for being independent if you see yourself with this girl long-term. This might mean a lot of hard work, and probably some sacrifices, but I guarantee you’ll be grateful that you did so a decade from now. Good luck sister ✊🏳️‍🌈"

Sometimes I would even read porn while he went down on me! (bless that boy I put him through so much)

I tried to blame it on so many things: weird health things we were both dealing with, my kinky preferences, that he probably just sucked really really hard at fucking. It took me another year after leaving that relationship (for unrelated reasons) for me to realize that it wasn’t his fault and I just didn’t like men that way.

Look I can’t tell you your sexuality. But I’m gonna be straight with you (ha), you sound like a lesbian to me. But either way, this guy just doesn’t seem to be doing it for you. You clearly care a lot about him but you wish you were having sex with someone else, it sounds like you’d just be better off being good friends with him and finding someone who’s more compatible with you.

I would say that when he’s in high school would be the right time, as thats when he’ll have enough personal agency to seek treatment on his own if he wants to.

Until then you need to be as big a part of his life as you can afford to be. For one that diagnoses will be a huge blow, he’ll see himself as a freak but if you can frame it as him being like his ‘cool auntie bff’ then it maybe won’t seem so bad.

I did end up going on a date with her though! She was super nice and cute but unfortunately it didn’t work out cuz she was poly and I’m *very* not. But anyway moral of the story is shoot your shot and always take your glasses to work."

Please. Dump. Him. Thats honestly one of the biggest red flags I’ve ever seen on the subreddit. Run don’t walk.

Also as someone else on the road to recovery from a serious panic disorder I wish you all the best. Keep up the fight sister."

So I’ll just tell you what ID do in your place (prefaced with this is assuming that your family is in a secure spot financially to do the following). First you need to talk to her parents to gauge if this girls reaction is true. If they’re at least mildly supportive then thats great. All you have to do is ground your son to the end of time and make him get a job to pay for child support.

If they really DO kick her out, your priorities shift. I would take her in and support her, stressing that it is NOT contingent with her remaining romantic partners with your son. She’s the mother of your grandchild, she’s *family* now, and you might be the only family she’ll have left. 

But thats just what I’d do. Again, no right answer here. I hope everything works out...and that you tear your son a new one."
