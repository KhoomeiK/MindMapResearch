Coronavirus,fl6bfb0,t1_fl67zx3,1584861416.0,"Same. But it was my roommate who wanted to have people over last night. She's 31 but I'm almost 50 with asthma.  I blew a gasket and then she literally threw a tantrum, screaming at my door at 11:30pm."
insanepeoplefacebook,fl2kosv,t1_fl1i9p9,1584753320.0,I am so sorry for your loss. Truly
insanepeoplefacebook,fl2kd9n,t1_fl1qo9r,1584753095.0,Don't let that SOB win.  Fight hard to live.  I understand wanting the pain to stop. I really do. But Never give up PLEASE!
Coronavirus,fkzslj5,t3_fllt3m,1584679143.0,So sad
Anxiety,fkubio7,t3_fkpccr,1584546245.0,Create a routine for yourself.  Organize a planner for the next day. Much like you would for class. Pull from your strengths. I'm sure you have a lot of them!  Is there something that you can teach from home?  There's A LOT of parents worried about their kids education right now. Myself being one of them.  We need teachers right now more than ever.
Anxiety,fkuakxo,t1_fku9mkx,1584545705.0,"I love Yoga with Adrienne!  The first time I did one of her videos, the first time I had ever done yoga, the tears just started flowing. A lot of my anxiety comes from unresolved trauma and grief. I hadn't cried for years! I was able to just sit there and feel grief without the fear.  It was a beautiful experience."
CPTSD,fkliio3,t1_fkkhocd,1584307025.0,"Yes we all need some compassionate companionship during times like this.  I've only been snowed in for 5 days before, but I knew what to expect. Never experienced anything like this.  Thank you and keep safe.  We'll all get thru this üí™"
CPTSD,fkkfns2,t1_fkk11oc,1584282872.0,"I'm in the process of creating my safe place at home. Things that help me self soothe.  Things that empower me.  It's helping me stay out of my emotional response brain.  Maybe there's things that you can do to empower yourself in this situation?  Have plenty of hand sanitizer and home sanitizer, food/water, relaxing bath salts, a couple good books and supplies for your hobbies.  I'm an artist so I have made sure to have enough supplies to keep me busy at home.

Remember to find the beauty of life, it's the simple things that heals.  I wish you all the best, stay safe"
CPTSD,fkjhoy9,t1_fkjg417,1584246245.0,"I disagree. This post is for people who have Complex trauma. The world is in a crisis situation. When you can't depend on your country's leaders to keep you safe it's very much a trigger for past trauma. When we feel unheard, unloved, unsafe it's very traumatizing.  A leader of a country who is a narcissist is like being in a trapped abusive relationship. There's no way out.  ""Normal"" people don't understand the emotional response we feel when we feel unsafe.  This sub is the only place most of us can find compassion and understanding"
CPTSD,fkjgyt3,t1_fkj9dx7,1584245615.0,This sounds like something Trump would do.  He is such a major trigger for me.  I'm scared what it's going to take to get the country and it's leaders to wake up.  I'm really scared

Anxiety,fkdh4qe,t3_fhrl00,1584078578.0,"Thank you for your amazing words.  We just got our first confirmed case in my town. So things have become very tense. Good news is like being at home. I'm an artist so as long as I don't run out of paint I'm good.

Cheers from the middle of Oregon"
mentalhealth,fd2q34q,t1_fd2n4hy,1578150565.0,"I suffered a traumatic brain injury on top of the years of trauma.  So I've had to learn things from ground floor.  So that complicated healing the PTSD. At first I had no thoughts talking to people. It was more like just trying to figure out what they were saying. But I used Luminosity and played word games to teach my brain what it was forgetting. There is always a way to reach your goals.

Be kind to yourself. You will never be the same person that you were before trauma. Surviving trauma develops strength you never knew you had. Wisdom, and the ability to understand yourself, listen to the lessons that life is showing you and learn.  Recovery is a blessing, a gift.  Just never give up on yourself.  You are wiser and stronger than you know"
mentalhealth,fd2mgri,t3_ejwsoh,1578149317.0,"I think I understand what you are saying. I do the same thing. Makes it so difficult to engage with others.  I used to be on sertraline and responded well to it. It helped calm racing thoughts. Make sure to follow your prescriber's directions.  Consistency is really important.  

Hope that helps"

mentalhealth,fd1ktn1,t3_ejq76g,1578132644.0,"There's also online help.  Lots of support groups online. You're never in this alone.   The top resource is the NIMH National Institute of Mental Illness. www.nimh.nih.gov.    Another one is NAMI They have a helpline also 800-826-3632. www.nami.org.  These two should be able to give you resources, support groups and good advice.

Feel free to message me if you need help navigating. It's overwhelming and scary to walk this road alone.  There's hope!"

CPTSD,f948fti,t1_f92405h,1575080465.0,"I had a heart attack due to my anxiety. My PCP was prescribing my meds until I could get into MH. But wouldn't give me benzos. My son was graduating from high school and I was determined to go.  Every person involved in my trauma was going to be there. Plus I avoid crowds at all costs. I had been having chest pain but told myself I was just weak not being able to cope with my anxiety.  The night before the event I ran into my ex.  Heart palpitations turned into a crushing pain.  I went to immediate Care and after running an EKG they called an ambulance. After a lot of meds and testing I was able to leave the hospital just in time to see my son graduate.

I'm 49 and have lived with anxiety/panic attacks for as long as I remember. I have a damaged heart now.  Take heart palpitations seriously and never feel bad for speaking up for yourself.

Sorry for my long reply, just gave me a flashback to that time."

CPTSD,f6v5kvy,t3_dt0itu,1573177223.0,"IDK if this is helpful but my first counselor after I left my abuser said very simple but prolific words to me.  She wanted me to draw/color anything just something.  I didn't want to. I was scared to.  I was overwhelming terrified.  The she said ...

""Just choose a color. Any color. There's no right or wrong choice.""

9 years later, I make my living as an abstract artist.  When I get stuck I hear her words.  Choosing a color helps me feel empowered, accepted and loved by myself.

Hope this helps.   (It was black üòâ)"

Her husband told my son that I suffer from PTSD because I have a weak mind and spirit.   So I prayed over it.  God told me that it's the ignorance of their weak minds  Let them pray but continue being my awesome self taking care of me!    We rarely speak anymore, like years."

It's gotten so bad at times I get tremors that have turned into pseudo seizures. Only to create social anxiety. UGH"
