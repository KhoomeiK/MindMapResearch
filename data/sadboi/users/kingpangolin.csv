I think it is completely reasonable to be uncomfortable with the situation. That isn’t what makes you the asshole. What makes you the asshole is that you knowingly got into the relationship, expressed that you were okay with him having a female roommate, and only now are bringing up you being uncomfortable. You can’t get angry at people for breaking boundaries you never set, and you can’t control what she wears in her house. Also, you texted her directly instead of setting up boundaries with your boyfriend, which is a major red flag you have given your boyfriend.

Don’t listen to all the replies telling you that you should comfortable with X and Y or it’s trust issues. You are comfortable with what you are comfortable with, but it is your job to set those boundaries clearly and openly at the start of the behavior, and if the other person isn’t comfortable with the boundary then at least you know early that the relationship might not be right."

Yeah, they are operating at a loss with a final mission though - create the dominant supply chain and squash competitors so they can eventually jack up prices and completely control mass market consumer goods.

 Is it really that China is a highly skilled highly specialized country, or is it that China is a dictatorship that dictates what each individual learns from a young age so as to create a machine of people to work in horrible conditions.

It's pretty easy to have great infrastructure when you have a slave army at your command and give no basic quality of life to your poor. I'm not saying America is great, but I'd sure rather live in this toilet that than that shithole. 

These kinds of comments are dangerous because they misrepresent the truth in the very way the Chinese government does to it's own people every day while turning a blind eye on the massive human rights violations occurring in that country.
