DeadBedrooms,floza2b,t3_fps7fo,1585348514.0,"Im in awe, you described the aching lingering pain of not being ""wanted"" so well. I was in a similar kind of dynamic for over 6 years. It was so passionate in the beginning, after I fell completely in love with him the rejections started. The resentment built so much that I could barely stand it I would go mad, I swear he would use sex as a means to control me. Whenever I would be about to loose it and we would start to fight , he would passionately have sex with me. And when it would happen I would be so thankful that he paid attention and then would have to wait another month or more for him to become interested only because I was about to loose my mind again. He had rejected me so often that I was really insecure about initiating and frankly tired of being the initiator. It is everything to feel desired, to be wanted, to belong, to be home!! It's crazy that a person can just selfishly take all the love that you give and choose not to give it back. My Ex was kind(ish),  but he never really complimented me, he loved to hold me at night as yours does and  keep me close. I was a creature comfort for him that he didn't have to work too hard for because I did all of the work in trying to be better or fix things. In the end I realized he took me for granted, being taken for granted by one who is supposed to cherish you through life is the biggest betrayal. It was so hard to leave him , the in fact when I left him I realized things we had in common were not so . We had become so intertwined I didn't know where I started and he ended. When I left I realized he wasn't who I thought he was. I had been projecting my own values onto him. He had in fact thought me as a possession and he took me for granted. It was amazing how far out the door I was when he finally picked up his head and tried to grab me only to find I slipped away like a slow motion car crash.

Your post really struck a chord in me. I wish you the best with your partner I hope that he would be willing to do therapy or take interest in not loosing you while it still matters. If he is giving you the impression that he it wouldn't matter to him if you are there or not he doesn't deserve you. You've learned something very valuable from this. You have learned what you want from a relationship, a loving partner and what that relationship would look and feel like. I was 26 when I left him I had been with him sense I was 19. It was so hard but I decided I needed to learn to love myself more because he wasn't going to do it. That was three years ago , sense then I met the most wonder man who desires me and whom I married. Every morning he greets me with a good morning beautiful and a kiss.  You deserve your prince"

Heres a good article on how to use it. Be careful to use a small amount a little goes a long way coconut oil will deff help to not have it be so sticky and mat up your hair. I'd recommend getting a cold pressed organic bottle of Castor oil. I got the NOW brand from my local health food store for like $12 I put it on my face almost every night in the winter for my dry skin and my eyebrows, I notice that my eyebrows have gotten much thicker in the past two months. The bottle will last you FOREVER so it's worth getting the good stuff

You essentially tell them all your worries and put them under your pillow then at night they would go around and fix all of your problems. I was having problems with one of my kindergarten teachers, she was really mean to me and would bully me in front of the other students. The other teacher had remarked on this to my mother. ( it turned out I had a step cousin who was a real hellion he was two years older then me and he used to kick her, so she associated me with him and was very mean.) I went to bed telling the worry dolls how i was dreading school the next day. When I fell asleep I dreamt that my window was open and I heard voices outside calling to me, when I popped my head out of the window the worry dolls had grown into giants. One picked me up and put me on their shoulder we walked around the city until we found Mrs Roy's  house, then we just sort of watched her make dinner and eat it in front of the TV"
