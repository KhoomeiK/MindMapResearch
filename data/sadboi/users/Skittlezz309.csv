Does it require intent for it to be considered as such?

Arguably, everything is either a request to ""limit their behavior"" of someone or it's an ultimatum ""if you do X, I will do Y"" which is manipulation either with or without intent.

The thing I get hung up on (FYI, I have Borderline Personality Disorder, hence attempting to clarify general use of wording and classification, etc) is that all of the three things mentioned above are bad:

Limiting the behavior of others.
Presenting ultimatums.
Manipulation of any caliber.

And when I start breaking all of this down, it turns into ""everything I could ever ask for is bad"" ..even something as simple as ""please pass the butter."" Yes yes, you are not obligated in any way to pass said butter and you could easily say no. BUT arguably my request fell into one or more of those three bad categories mentioned above, which you could then say it was wrong of me to ask for the butter.

***Example:

The night before last, while we were watching our shows, near-ish the end of the episode, I asked if I could have a massage. He said ""sure"" in that way, like he always does when I ask for one, despite it having been about a month since I last asked for one because of this very thing.

So I called him out on it, saying he sounded like he didn't really want to do it. His reply was ""if I *wanted* to do it, don't you think I would already be doing it? But you asked and I said I would, so I will."" Me being me told him to forget about it because I didn't want one under those circumstances. Naturally he tried arguing out of my position of declining this massage that now felt obligatory, but I stood my ground and we went to bed.

Funny part is that yesterday he ended up OFFERING me a massage and sounded all sweet about it. We had also been smoking weed and precious to that he commented actual feeling pretty high, which I have noticed soften his edges and we get along better.

Thing is, now you need to stick to it. Typically when you give people ultimatums, they will go with the path opposite of what the giver of said ultimatum wants.

If you get dumped because you tell them what you think you have, then you didn't need them anyway. A good partner will support on your journey, because now that you ""know"" what the cause of so many different issues stems from, you can begin the process of getting help.

BPD,fn0mkkr,t1_fn0ibv0,1586544709.0,"The answer is complicated. We met while in previous poly relationships. I had a husband and he had a fiance. His fiance suggested them opening up and I suggested it to my now ex, though it was from a point of unhappiness with our relationship and me being in denial about it. Meeting Chris was like a breath of fresh air and was everything I wanted in a partner, so a month into us dating, I broke up with my now ex-husband. 2 months later he broke up with his fiance, because things started breaking down with them due to her lying about being at work when she was really visiting her by, while Chris would be at home with her son.

So when we set out on it just being us together, he talked a lot about how he really wanted to do a threesome. I didn't know anyone interested and figured ""why not"" to the idea of it being his former long-term fwb Amanda. Never had a threesome with a another lady and someone I was dating before then. She was clearly into him more than me and then at the end I started feeling left out and like I was fading away, so just the room in a panic. Chris of course chased me and did damage control to calm me down, whole still showing visible irritation with me. I pulled myself together, apologized to her, and walked her to her car. She pretended to be my friend. This was August 2018. I met Chris is March 2018. Going forward, we kept it as just us.

Then February I inappropriately discovered, by logging into his fb messenger, that he was planning on cheating on me with her the following day. I was at the end of my work day when I saw it, so I went home and confronted him and he immediately remorseful and ceased all contact. Nothing with her has come up since.

In the month or two after I caught him, the whole time I worried that he would try it again and so admittedly I suggested us meeting other ladies, etc, ones that neither of us had prior history with, to see where it goes.

Anytime a lady gets close enough to him and I feel like he is more interested in her or that she's ""better"" than me, it stressed me out and I struggle with it and usually can't hide it, so it becomes this thing.
