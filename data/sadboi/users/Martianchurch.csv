Prior to being on Suboxone I was on very high doses of oxy neo and oxycodone for about 15 years, and was still severely undermedicated. The initial plan had been to switch to a combination of a fentanyl patch and ketamine cream/rub, but then the college of physicians decided that the only people who could access the ketamine cream/rub were patients admitted into a hospital. So at that point my doctor decided to try subs.

To tell you the truth, I feel better than I have in decades. I would never go back to the oxys by choice, and the fentanyl kinda scared the shit out of me."

Fast forward twenty years, and be damned if we don't end up not only living in the the same tiny town together, but find out we are next door neighbours. We were immediately drawn to each other, and of course had both changed exponentially! We've now been together for three years, and are building a life together. I'm more attracted to him at this point in time than I ever was before. Gone is that sinewy hard body, and in its place is the sexiest dad bod I have ever had the pleasure of touching! I seriously can't keep my hands and eyes off of him! Beyond that, the way he takes my life in stride (as it always seems to be a rocky road of one small explosion after another) is almost poetic. I have honestly never been so attracted to another human being. It's glorious!

Last April my 17 year old daughter confronted her father about nearly the exact same kind of behaviour you are describing, with minut differences. The inappropriate touching, that no one but you seems to notice/object to.  Telling her fkd up things, like, which room of their dad's house (it just happened to currently be her bedroom) that she had been conceived in. Forcing her to sleep in his bed with him (when his wife was out of town), laying on top of him, face to face. If you look at each individual thing, someone might be able to brush shit off as a parent being slightly, inappropriately affectionate. BUT!!! when you put all of the pieces together, it's a sick, twisted web of sexual abuse, that hasn't necessarily escalated to full on assault. 

Needless to say my ex husband didn't deal well with being *accused* of doing anything wrong. Within an hour of her confronting him and subsequently leaving his house, he literally cut ties with her completely. Cut off her car insurance, disconnected her phone, changed all of the passwords to the family accounts (Netflix, Spotify, etc). Tell me that doesn't just *scream* guilt! But, the entire ordeal has brought my girl and I closer to each other than ever before. She is no longer in that home, and will never have to face her abuser again, which is what she so desperately desires. Sadly, my other two children are still there. They both admit to knowing about what had been happening, but also both stated that they thought she didn't mind any of it. It's just a sick sick situation.

My girl says she remembers this shit going on as far back as her memories go. It wasn't until she was about 13/14 that she began to clue in to the fact that not all father's were like hers. In fact, most weren't. And even after that epiphany, it still took her 3 years to stand up for herself, and ask for help. By the time she came to me she was suicidal, self harming all of the time, and so very depressed. Since April she has been seeing a psychiatrist twice monthly, and a psychologist that specializes in childhood sexual trauma/incest every week. She is a different kid now. She actually smiles, without faking it. She's starting to wear clothes that aren't ten times too big for her (to hide her body). She's finally learning to be at peace with herself, which is a gift that I simply cannot put into words.

Long story short - please please please trust your gut. Your story is eerily familiar.

I no longer attend a pain clinic, and my sub doctor works in conjunction with my GP anytime I have additional pain needs. (Eg. During the aftermath of a surgery a few months ago, they backed my subs off for a few days and prescribed hydromorphone for the worst of my recovery, eventually returning to the 30mg/day subs once my pain had leveled off a bit.) My psychiatrist also plays an active part by communicating openly with both my sub doc and GP, and in turn, I am still prescribed prn benzo's (with the understanding that I not be alone when I take them). My personal experience being on Suboxone for pain has been extremely positive, but I have a kick ass medical team taking care of me. I haven't had to go to random walk in clinics or emergency rooms, and haven't experienced the judgement that others speak of. I only attend one pharmacy, and they have never denied me anything I've requested either. 

I don't intend to sound pretentious. I honestly think I am just really fucking lucky to be having the experience that I am. But, I'm living proof that it's possible.

Good luck with everything!

Edit: I just thought that I should clarify, in my situation, I am soley prescribed subs for chronic pain."

I *still* haven't been able to decide on a business name, so I've just kind of been using my first name. Before I can open shop online, I do need to make a decision though. Do you happen to have any suggestions for me? I'm seriously stumped.

* Thus far I have been selling pins and earrings, but I don't want the name to be specific to those items, so that I have the freedom to expand in any direction in the future."

I'm going to speak with him tonight about everything you have suggested here and see if he'd be open to it. Man, I really hate how invasive this has to be, I feel bad for him/you. 

Regardless, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom. I feel so lost, and I know he does as well."

I've just started doing local markets quite recently to see if there would be enough interest in my pins and earrings to warrant paying for an online shop. This morning I posted a picture to Instagram for fun, and the orders began pouring in! Today's successes, coupled with some fantastic *local* *market* experiences, have guaranteed an Etsy shop in my very near future. I could pm you just in case you're still interested :).

Sorry for the rant, I'm just kind of excited!"

I remember literally shedding tears of guilt every single time I got myself off as a teen. But regardless of how hard I tried to stop myself, I simply couldn't. To be honest, I had residual guilt surrounding masturbation until well into my 30's."

I am honestly willing to do ANYTHING to help him with this endeavour. Do you have any suggestions regarding what I could personally do?"

We both have each other's pass codes, but it's just kind of been an unspoken rule that we respect each other's privacy.

We live in a relatively small community (1200 ppl), but there is a small city near by. I doubt they have therapists who specialize specifically in porn addiction sadly. I wonder if simply an addictions councilor could still be helpful?"

To be fair, I was 20 at the time. But you know, now that I'm really thinking hard about it, I do believe I'd still choose the same name.
