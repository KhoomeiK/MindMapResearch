As someone who is not on the spectrum but lives with one who is I mistook stimming for a reaction to pain and stress, and treated as such. It was not until I educated myself that I stopped being worried when I saw her rocking or sitting backwards in chairs.
Usually the issue is us misreading the physical actions and distress or simply indecipherable, which makes us uncomfortable. 
Until we accept the education most just allow it to stay at uncomfortable and write it off as ""a weird auspe thing"".
I really wish more folks would just open a dialog and learn, as well as accept what they are being told."

It depends if you are comfortable modeling what you can make out of them, but if your playing at home you can always proxy them as something else with a bit of paint.
Any extra gigs you can sell for nostalgia, just shop Ebay for a good starting price range or ""Buy it now"".
The sculps are not bad, but variety has to be added with paint unless you are comfortable sculpting. 
Hope that helps!"
