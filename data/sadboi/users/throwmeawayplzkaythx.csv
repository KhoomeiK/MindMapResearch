I noticed that part too, the ""for my own sanity,"" immediately after saying he doesn't want a foundation there. Like damn, some sour grapes want some?"
raisedbynarcissists,flfrml9,t3_foa8yz,1585115302.0,Wow are you me? This was helpful to see. Sucks it's the reality but nice to see words put to it so succinctly. Easier to work on things when bite-sized :/
BreakUps,fl016p6,t1_fkzyz1q,1584687397.0,"Sorry to hear that. And while that is a lot of texts, it's not that much with a friend. I sort of wish my friends would do that, I'm always curious what's on their minds."
SuicideWatch,fkv525n,t3_f9d5go,1584562232.0,"This is my default state of 33 years. Didn't think it was so ingrained until I found my old writings from childhood. It gets... better? Have to believe so since the unknown is more terrifying than life at the moment. Just can't shake the feeling I'd come back as a worse minority or something. If life for over half the population can be so cruel and miserable, then it would be just my luck that there really would be an afterlife and I'd be even worse off in it."
SuicideWatch,fkv4kyf,t1_fkttzku,1584561944.0,"Same here. The rat race is palpable. Hope you find any and everything to distract yourself with. Wishing you luck, and I'm so very sorry."

raisedbynarcissists,fkfbwfb,t1_fkeysav,1584131076.0,"Huh, my Ndad did this too. Started LC and told them about it, saying I was starting therapy again and preferred to not call them every week while I dealt with things. Low and behold 2 weeks later the voicemails started, ""Just seeing if you're alive and why you won't call your ol' man, teheehe. Nooo, we just WORRY about you, kiddo."" This man told me at 16 that if my mom died in Kuwait it would be my fault. Of course he doesn't remember that"
raisedbynarcissists,fkegkxi,t3_fi0ond,1584112750.0,"So sorry to hear this. You deserve better. Worried this may happen to me too, as my mental health deteriorates after bf and I split. Keep reaching out and be good to yourself."
raisedbynarcissists,fkck7ss,t1_fkbs7f4,1584054848.0,Thanks so much. Just what I needed to hear. This sub is invaluable. <3
raisedbynarcissists,fkbnps9,t3_fhj5ik,1584036407.0,"Keep trying, it's a numbers game. Sometimes it's about that one comment saying, message me when things get tough. Then you really feel like you can talk back and forth with someone and it lets the sunshine in. To supplement, I went on a support group app meant for actual chatting, and people update every hour or so which is helpful. It's for breakups though, so maybe finding one for childhood trauma would be better suited.

That said, feel free to message this throwaway anytime. I'll be keeping it until I can get back into therapy or get over my breakup, so... probably a few months at least."
raisedbynarcissists,fkbn0mh,t3_fhj6lt,1584036025.0,"Just the title alone made me gasp and shiver. Just. Omg, so sorry, that is... no words. Stay strong and I hope you don't have to put up with that anymore."

I'd actually forgotten this was a thing (NC for years now), my Ndad would stall the family for attention, especially when we had to be out the door quickly for something not related to him."

BreakUps,fk9w9yt,t3_fh9vxf,1583985154.0,"It may sound crazy, and maybe it is. I've heard people will wait for an excuse to fight so they can break up because they feel guilty bringing it up otherwise. Or there could be chemical brain issues, depression, mania, etc. Were there warning signs of a personality disorder? Does seem like they're hiding the real reason. I'm so so sorry. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to message."

BreakUps,fk9va6m,t3_fh7lmk,1583984443.0,"It's okay to split if it just isn't working. Sounds like you set her free to work on her undiagnosed mental illness. You probably saved her life tbh. And if it's a lifestyle issue only, it's entirely possible a reconnection could take place once those issues are behind her. You saved yourself a lifetime of resenting her. You did the right thing, keep strong. The sobbing stops eventually I promise!"
BreakUps,fk9uv5x,t3_fh6krm,1583984150.0,There's a ted talk on YT called healing from a broken heart or some such thing. Goes into NC quite heavily and it's a short watch. I plan on rewatching it whenever things get tough.
BreakUps,fk9umi6,t3_fh7znp,1583983985.0,Ouch back. Broke up on Friday night. Hit me up if you need to scream onto a keyboard any time.
BreakUps,fk9ugh1,t3_fh6ow4,1583983874.0,Ikr?? Feeling lucky at how active this sub is but realized that's not such a good thing though lol. I wonder how many watched Daniel Sloss' break up comedy thing on Netflix. Apparently his breakup numbers are well into the thousands now

No, they're just mad that THEY'RE not allowed to hurt them anymore."

BreakUps,fk51y3x,t3_fgir6e,1583871910.0,"7 years here too. You got this. Do not talk to him. Do not. He is being completely selfish and will only hinder your recovery. I don't care how drunk I am, I would never speak to a recent ex so casual and callously (his 'fucking' comment).

And as for the ""too old,"" fear, I heard somewhere recently that 90% of relationships that start before 30 end broken up. If anything, you're right in the sweet spot to heal and have better luck next time.
