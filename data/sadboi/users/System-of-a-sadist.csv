socialanxiety,ez6c8ut,t3_d01i9i,1567711152.0,"No. I have social anxiety, but that isn’t an excuse to ghost someone. Don’t you dared try and justify that. It hurts, really hurts to be ghosted. Tell someone you’d rather not talk, or why your upset, ignoring them, makes them feel like absolute shit. Especially if they to have anxiety, because now they’re question why, and what they’ve done wrong, and now they hate themselves more than they hate you. I’d never ghost a person."
