Like when he said he was legally changing his name to Ye, making a Yeezus movie, moving back to Chicago, and making those fucking dome houses (which got demolished, since his retard metal ass didn't get the fucking paperwork done AFTER the city gave him way more time than necessary. Oh yeah also, I 100% DOUBT he even  knew who X was before he died, not that I'm a fanboy but still. I've been a Kanye fan since I first heard him on the radio; born in 2001 but still vividly remember listening to his shit. He's just being a dick, I literally can't name the last fucking time he even SAID yandhi. hes just chillin next to Kim K's cement ass in bed, sleeping without a care in the world, while we, his fans, stay  up late and get our expectations demolished. over and over and over. remember how hyped n shit when he was recording somewhere in mf Africa ? and when he did that cicada hacker goose chase shit ? that led to NOTHING ?  And now on top of that, yandhi is scrapped and replaced with this gospel bullshit. and on TOP of that, this man's saying he's doing gospel only. And ON TOP OF ALL THAT BS, he says he regrets calling himself Yeezus, I bet he probably regrets the whole damn album. Yeezus was a hero fueled by mania and raw fuckin anger, i loved it.  And now he just spit on all of that. I've before in my life, but I unironically miss the old Kanye. fuck this shit man, later.

Sidenote: Can we actually fucking demonstrate outside this guy's house and demand the shit he's promised over n over ? If he's so full of ""love"" why doesn't he even show it to his fucking fans. Love you all."
