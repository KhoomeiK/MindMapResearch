Hyaluronic acid is a somewhat complicated ingredient... (your Neutrogena moisturizer).  It needs water to work, so always apply it to damp skin.  Then you need to lock it in with a thicker oil or moisturizer, or the water will evaporate and dry out your skin even more.  In the morning, your Cerave AM will do that.  You need something for nighttime.  CeraVe has a lot of lotions you can use.  

Also, The Neutrogena Hydro Boost you have there has fragrance.  There's another one (I think it says for ""dry skin"" that is fragrance free).  This might not be an issue for you, a lot of people are not sensitive to fragrance, but just keep that in mind, and if you repurchase, look for the fragrance free one.

I'm not a fan of Micellar water.  I was using it and it was causing irritation, and have read bad things about it since.  I switched to cold cream, and my skin likes it much better.  

&#x200B;

Morning... cleanse with your vanicream or just water (if you're peeling and dry, probably just water is fine).  Always use warm/cool water (never hot).

Neutrogena Gel applied to **damp** skin, then your CeraVe AM on top of that.  Pat it all in and let it dry. 

&#x200B;

Evening... Double cleanse... I think an oil cleanser or balm is better than the micellar water.  I'm using Ponds cold cream at the moment... it's definitely helped my skin not be irritated like it was with the Micellar water (and I shouldn't even say irritated... more like my skin was the same, which wasn't great... switching to cold cream has made my skin softer, more hydrated and have less redness).   I'm in a lot of skincare groups, watch youtubers, etc, and no one really recommends micellar water.  

You said you don't always feel clean after just micellar water... you need to use your vanicream cleanser every night after your first cleanse (whether you keep using your micellar water for your first cleanse or something else).  The first cleanse gets off the SPF, surface dirt, etc, and the second cleanse gets into your pores and skin.  Micellar water isn't meant to be used for the second cleanse.  Your Vanicream cleanser should be perfect for that. 

&#x200B;

So for your double cleanse at night... Micellar water or oil/balm/cold cream, then your vanicream cleanser (every night, whether you wear makeup or not).  

Then your Neutrogena Gel moisturizer applied to **damp** skin, then another moisturizer on top of that.  (again, Cerave has great ones).  Pat it all in and let dry.

The Ordinary skincare company has great products, very inexpensive... you might want to get an oil from them for nighttime use.  

I don't know that much about exfoliation, so I hesitate to recommend anything there.  If nothing else, I'd cut back a bit to once or twice a week and see how that works.  I've read good and bad things about the pixie glow.  

&#x200B;

Hope any of that helps.  I've found if I read 10 skincare articles, I'll find 1 or 2 pieces of advice that work for me.  So keep researching and reading."
