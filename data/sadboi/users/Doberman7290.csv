I preheat it for like 10 minutes at 390.  Then I fill the bowl with ground cannabis but I don’t pack it.  Wait 5 mins , take a few cloudless puffs, and then turn it up until I’m around 420 and then it will finish.

It uses a lot of weed in the process ,  sometimes I feel “stoned” other times I just feel slightly elevated.

Sometimes I will load the actual whip and then the bottom get really hot -

FRX has good stuff , but depending on where you live it can be very expensive.

Cresco is a solid option in many ways.  I will say that I was not impressed with the last batch of bio Jesus and pineapple I had.  But you will get buds. 

Grassroots - Birthday Cake and Pelliroja are fantastic. I’ve found the rest I’ve tried to be hit or miss.

Illera gets a bad rap , but If you are tight or just want to medicate with quantity their 80 dollar quarters aren’t that bad.

Prime - hit or miss.  They have great strains that go south on you after like a day or two.

GLeaf - won’t buy.  Probably one of the worst 1/8 I ever had was their Special Ops - it was yucky.

Terrapin - won’t buy.  I used to dig them, but that’s all over now.
 

1937 -  dry and tasteless

Those are the ones I’ve tried. 


As far as the carts go , I would look for Cresco LLR At around 50 for 500 mg.  They taste really nice.

CY in Butler and New Ken pretty much offer the same menus, one will be ahead of the other by a day.  They offer a lot.  But mainly it’s been all Cresco, GLeaf, and Illera 

the healing center - has a mix , but mainly terrapin and GLeaf with a few others sprinkled in.  This is the only disp I’ve seen 1937 at.

Herbology is Grassroots , but mostly they have Illera.

Solevo - terrapin and prime

Delta 9 -  some cool FRX, but mainly Illera

Rise - this has the rythym and that’s where I’ve been heading lately.
