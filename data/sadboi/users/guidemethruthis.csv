Meditation,fpcyfu2,t3_gcnty9,1588515843.0,"I’m personally in the beginning of my journey, and I feel like writing my ”revelations” up kind of helps me conceptualize and be confident in what I’m feeling a bit better. 

What I’ve found to be really helpful is reading texts on mindfulness and writing up all of my feelings in text message conversations with my girlfriend (we’re long distance). 

This is influenced by the fact that I’m using mindfulness, meditation and spirituality to help against anxiety and depression. Writing helps me reinforce the feeling that I’m on the right path, because my illness wants to trick me into thinking that itself is the truth. It’s a constant fight.

Then again like someone else said, things that you are meant to remember will stick with you whether you write them down or not. If you feel you can still delve deeper into a thought, I suppose it would be more useful to rather do that than break out of it."
Existential_crisis,fp1a0bn,t1_fp15tug,1588228775.0,"As bleak as my initial post seemed, I personally have made a lot of progress. If you can’t stop obsessing over your thoughts then I suggest you seek therapy because you might have OCD or a similar illness making your thought processes worse. This is definitely a livable condition."
depression,foy82t7,t1_foy7fr5,1588167416.0,"Personally I filled my life with work and hobbies among other distractions in order to escape things that deep down made me anxious and depressed. This pandemic had given me a lot of time for self-reflection which eventually drove me to deep depression and anxiety and a couple of days ago I kind of hit rock bottom. Little by little I see things differently and want to make a positive change. However if you are content with your life now, feel free to be. It’s yours."
depression,foxgg0z,t1_fovediy,1588143230.0,"You sound like a great person. Remember that your life is still yours to live - if you are content with being a medded up zombie, then that’s your meaning. Maybe you should into other types of volunteer work, if living for others makes you feel good?"
Existential_crisis,foxf0qd,t1_fowp9jc,1588141998.0,"Have you tried meditation, mindfulness etc.? It sounds like you might benefit from it. At least for me this experience is giving motivation to start trying to explore some sort of spiritual, if not religious side of my consciousness."
Existential_crisis,fos0htv,t1_forux1p,1588021741.0,"Thanks for your reply. I feel that this is the western way of going about things - people who can do so find satisfaction in God and the rest just occupy themselves with whatever since our worldview only kind of includes christianity and atheist, scientific nihilism. There are other options to process these thoughts, and I think I will try them before I settle into one of those two."
Existential_crisis,forgoo0,t1_fore4rd,1588011924.0,"Thanks for your reply, I would love to message someone about this."
depression,fordyip,t1_fordkfp,1588010597.0,"Thank you, this inspired me into considering confiding in my girlfriend. I believe that this has already transcended being just a fear/crisis and just full on is an anxiety disorder at this point. The subject matter is just really difficult. That would mean that maybe confiding in other people might not set on these feelings in them, since they aren’t affected by this disorder."
depression,fordf52,t1_forckla,1588010337.0,"Thank you for these words. I've pondered and tried to grasp on to love as a meaning for my existence (I have had a girlfriend for 2 and a half years now but she lives in another city ATM), but I completely lost my grip on that too. I also feel that there must be some sort of enlightening/closure/meaning that will eventually reward me for facing this bullshit head on. Right now it feels absolutely devouringly terrifying.  


I really wish you and me both, and anyone suffering from this have the time in our lives to find peace. This is honestly just no way to live."
depression,forbz32,t1_forbdio,1588009648.0,"No, nobody around me knows how I feel. I am an extremely outgoing person with a lot of friends, and I think a lot of people consider me fun and easy-going. I'm quite successful and don't deal with any sort of bodily dysmorphia either.

It's only inside myself that I deal with this huge anxiety which I feel I can't shake or deal with. I'm unable to confide these feelings even to my girlfriend, as I don't want to infect this horror on her."
