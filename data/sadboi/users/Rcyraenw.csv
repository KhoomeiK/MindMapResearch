Around the same time I saw a video on how to play lance and the only thing that I needed to see was the counter claw. That shit is so much fun to play around with. The counters just keep that damage momentum flowing and it feels like I'm almost always on the offensive while turtling. 

I should've picked up the lance so much sooner"

AskReddit,ffuf0in,t3_ev5zdg,1580240575.0,"A couple days ago. 

I've been trying to improve my mental health little by little since the beginning of the year and I've been coping with a close roommate, my best friend, moving out with her boyfriend. Now the big thing here is we used to date. She moved out here for me a year and a half ago and I wasn't in a good place at the time and broke it off. It was incredibly hard, of course and I felt awful, but we fostered the friendship we had and became pretty close friends. She found someone and is really happy with him and that's great, but after she left, I started to feel more and more alone. My loneliness set in much more often triggering my depression. The more I thought on it, the more I realized I took her company for granted, And that I probably cared for her at lot more deeply than I realized. 

I cried because I felt like an idiot. I broke her heart. I broke her heart and now I'm here crying over something I ruined. I'm crying because I could have been happy with her. I'm here mourning that I love her still and I messed it up for myself..."

DestinyTheGame,exaqy7g,t3_crule6,1566113822.0,"I actually really needed this. I stopped playing last season when I was about 1000 glory away from the recluse. The friends I was playing with weren't playing so it was hard to get online. Got into ffxiv shadowbringers and while I was there they were hardcore grinding a lot of the Pinnacle stuff so now I'm behind them and they don't want to do the glory grind with me cause competitive is cancer a lot of the time and it feels like I'm the only one who can keep a cool head while playing.


So I'm gonna go in alone with my Le Monarque and Oathbreakers and get it before Shadowkeep drops whether they want to help me or not."
