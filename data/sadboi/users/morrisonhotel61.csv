Honduras,euxgrhg,t1_eux2ze4,1564087348.0,"Sir, I'm aware there are difficulties in your home. I just left there in March. I saw poverty and harsh living conditions. I understand your political situation. Honestly you need UN oversight on elections to make them fair. I also know people are paid scant wages. My fiance works on base and is paid 400 USD a month. Now she is not poor. But she does get by. I had to send her money to bribe people so we can get marriage documents. I've seen first hand the barrios of Comayagua. I've seen the dichotomy of rich and poor in Tegucigalpa. I do love your country and people. I've met nothing but the kindest people there. I respect them. I will do all I can to help your people throughout my life. I bought a poor mother's daughter school supplies and paid her tuition for the year. I want to do so much more. But your people must also have a part in improving life, ending corruption. If they do, then life for many will get better instead of the few that line their pockets."

I left Honduras and comayagua a better place than what I found. We've helped many in need. So perhaps get some correct information. Don't paint us as evil-doers. I put my heart and soul into helping those in need."

To me a good partner has a kind heart, wonderful personality, treats me with respect and respects herself. I also value someone with a solid work ethic and belief in god.
When I was younger say 15 years ago. All I valued was the aesthetic. I had shitty relationships with beautiful women. Now I have a life long relationship with the most beautiful woman. I've ever met. Inside and out."
