If you want commiseration: My boyfriend also just started law school. I just moved across the country and also have no friends (just 1) in my new town, and my bf and I just started living together. Literally everything is stressful lol. I feel like I'm on the brink of crying most days honestly.

So I feel you, dude. For what it's worth, I know you have the power in you to get through this. You got into law school in the first place, so you're smart. Your school wouldn't have accepted you if they didn't think you could do it. Make sure you're kind to yourself and try to replace negative or panicky self-talk with positive self-talk! You're smart, you're capable, and you're going to be okay. :) When I feel really isolated texting or talking to friends (even if they're far away) helps me. Maybe if your school has a wellness center they can help you somehow? I skipped like a tonnn of classes when I was in language school because of mental health lol. To the point where they gave me one of those letters that was like, ""you have to go to class more or you'll be expelled."" Eek. But I still graduated. My teacher was actually really nice about it when I talked to her too. Maybe you can get notes from someone!

I know law school is hard, but I think you can do it! It's really just the feeling of being overwhelmed that's hardest, right? -- but that's just a feeling and it doesn't mean you're not capable. Sorry you're not feeling good and I hope you feel better. ‚ô•Ô∏è"

I have a few suggestions. First, there will be some things you have to buy, like nail clippers. You can use the ones made for cats. Different rabbits will be comfortable getting their nails trimmed in different ways. You can try swaddling her, as suggested. Other rabbits will sit still in your lap (sit them on their bum and support them against you) while you trim. I've also seen others put their rabbit on a counter, four feet against the surface, and brace them against their body with one arm, holding the rabbit under their elbow and trim the nails that way. She won't like getting it done but as long as she feels braced and secured in some way that should help. You'll have to buy nail clippers though (or maybe borrow someone's who has a cat!)

Secondly, I wouldn't spend money on toys, because you can make perfectly good bunny toys out of things people throw away anyway. Make little toys out of the cardboard from paper towels or toilet paper rolls. Get some cardboard boxes and build a little bunny castle. (Most retail stores throw away lots of cardboard boxes anyway so you might be able to get some free if you just ask around.) I've also seen people make treat dispensers out of empty water bottles that kept their rabbit entertained for hours. You can even use an old yellow pages book as long as it uses soy ink, some bunnies love tearing out the pages! I'd recommend just googling it and seeing suggestions. It may be good to have something hard to chew on too, like apple sticks or wood blocks, so you may have to buy those. Or find a carpenter with wood scraps! Just make sure it's bunny-safe wood and no sawdust.

As for sore hocks, I second what the other poster said -- make sure she's not standing on wire. If the floor is hard, make sure she has blankets or towels or something soft to sit on. Sore hocks can happen even on carpeting though, so don't blame yourself too much. The main thing is to check and see if her sore hocks are red, swollen, or bleeding. Sometimes what looks like sore hocks is really a healed spot -- like a little pink callus. That's nothing to worry about. Just make sure she has litter to prevent urine scalding, like the other person said. There's a cat litter called ""yesterday's news"" that's compressed paper which is cheaper than rabbit litter and you can use that. Just make sure you don't use any kind of sand, clay, or cedar/pine shavings. I always like putting a piece of paper down under my rabbit's litter to help with absorption, too. I like paper litters and compressed pelleted litters best.

As you already know, hay should be like 90% of a rabbit's diet, then some veggies, then a small amount of pellets. The cheapest place to get hay is directly from farms, although generally they sell in bulk. I don't know what's available to you, but you may be able to order some, or convince your parents to (maybe), since it's cheaper in the long run. (Like WAY cheaper.) And I definitely recommend stopping by your local grocer for veggie scraps! You probably won't even have to buy any vegetables for her this way. My local grocery store used to give me the carrot tops for free because people didn't want them anyway. Groceries will throw away tons of yummy rabbit delicacies, like carrot, beet, and radish tops, or the outer layer of cabbage or lettuce or other greens. Or ask around the Farmer's market. If you tell people it's for your adorable bunny, I've found many people willing to help. :) You can also try growing a little mint or parsley in your window! I heard mint grows like weeds.

Ok... I think that's all I've got haha. I second the idea of asking others for help, though! Even if some people don't help you, one person might, and that might change your bunny's life for the better.

Best of luck to you and your little bun!! ‚ô•Ô∏è"

BPD,ezrw076,t1_ezq28nn,1568079558.0,"Also, just gonna say it --him going back on his word like that is a total dick move. :/ I know your probably idealize him somewhat, but he doesn't sound like a good guy. Even him telling you to ""chill out because you know that pushes me away"" is suuuuper manipulative. Red flags all over.

And let's be real -- you've got things to work on. All that anger and jealousy... I know what that feels like. :( You need to give yourself the time and space to help yourself get better and to work on yourself, and this relationship is not helping you at all."
BPD,ezrv7m0,t1_ezqxiso,1568079241.0,"It's no problem! I'm glad I could support a little. It's always nice to speak with someone who has been through something similar. You're not overreacting by cutting him off, you're protecting yourself from further pain and heartbreak. And if it takes you some time, that's okay. It doesn't have to happen all at once. 

It really sounds like an unhealthy relationship. When someone pulls away like that and suddenly grows cold towards you and says ""I don't know why I'm like this,"" it's a very clear sign of avoidant attachment. And you seem to have an anxious attachment style, based on your actions and reactions. These two types of attachment styles often attract each other like magnets, and when they get together, it's bad. As you can see. It's a push-and-pull tug-of-war where no one wins. Disclaimer: I'm not a therapist lol, this is all stuff I've learned through therapy and I'm probably repeating things you've heard already. But for now, not being drawn into this further is the kindest thing you can do for yourself.

You can love someone and be totally drawn to them and still not be right for each other. And that sucks. When it was really bad for me and I almost lost the will to break things off, I reminded myself of all the pain the relationship had caused me. It's not fair for you to have to keep going through this. And honestly it's not good for him, either. Sometimes when nothing gets better you have to love someone enough to say goodbye, and love yourself enough to realize you deserve better.

Something I sometimes think about, too -- people like me with avoidant attachment styles try to keep everything at arm's length. We want relationships with people far away, because it's easy to idealize those. All the longing without any of the messy up-close interaction. You could move to be with him a million times, and every time you went, I guarantee he'll lose interest and you'll have to move back again. The same pattern will keep repeating until both of you fundamentally change, and that takes time and effort and lots of introspection. And therapy. I would challenge you to work on yourself, and learn what it means to truly love yourself, and one day when you're ready, try to find someone near you -- not miles and miles away, but living close by. That's the true challenge.

You can do it! You're stronger than you realize. If I can get this far, you can too! I believe in you. ü¶Ñ"

BPD,ezq5ybh,t3_d1uszi,1568055195.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. :( üíî You must be in terrible pain and turmoil right now. I've been in almost exactly the same situation you are in -- on and off relationship for years and years, living in different parts of the world far away from one another, the distancing, the desperation... Dating other people, or sometimes just sleeping with them, anyone, just to try to be okay and fill that hole in you. That feeling like you would rather not be alive than go through the wrenching pain of breakup. 

It's hard. But you're a lot stronger than you think you are. And I think you already know what you have to do, honestly. This isn't good for you. And it's not going to get better, and it's never going to be what you want it to be. I'm so sorry, but I think you know that's the truth.

Honestly, I still think about that person sometimes. It took me years and years to cut him off completely, and I know this is better for me, and for him, too. After we broke up for the last time, after thousands of miles and borders separated us, we tried to remain friends. But I couldn't do it. My heart always longed for him, and I'd obsess over it, wondering what he was doing, if he was still seeing that girl, what his family and friends thought of me... It never got better. And it's not worth it, honestly, please trust me on this.

This will likely be the hardest thing you ever have to do. It was for me. So far, at least. 

But here's what I recommend: Tell him that you can't do this anymore. Set clear lines and explain why. And then prevent yourself from ever contacting him again. For me, this meant leaving messages for him, and then deleting forever the app that we used to communicate with and throwing away the password. Unfriending him on Facebook, etc. I told him that I still cared about him and that if it were an emergency he would know how to contact me (email or whatever) because we truly were best friends for many years. 

Rely on friends!! And talk to a therapist, regularly! That's the only way. You're going to need outside support. Surround yourself with people who love and support you as much as possible. And then work on yourself. Work on making yourself better, and learn from this, so that it doesn't happen in the future. I know it will seem like the end of the world, but you are young. There will be many people in the future for you, many more opportunities for love and friendship and happiness. And it won't seem like it for now, but you'll be okay. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Rabbits,ey4iqw1,t1_ey30180,1566793741.0,"Lol, it sounds funny, but I actually did this at one point when my rabbit was first adopted and getting used to free roaming. Just make sure the walls of the pen are high enough, because my girl jumped over and onto the bed anyway. üòÇ Best of luck to you! Hope you can get some sleep."

BPD,ew5hohg,t3_cmxmuo,1565136523.0,"Yep, every single time. :')"
BPD,ew47zso,t1_ew3fjqu,1565104907.0,"Oh man, I play that game, too. :( My advice would be, don't, haha. It never ends well. One of the hardest things for me has been learning how to forgive myself. I'm honestly not sure I have yet, but I know it's unproductive to feel resentment towards myself like that. Try to think of what your best friend or your dog would say to you if you told them that. There's nothing you could have done. It's hard, I know, but it's not your fault. Wasn't then, isn't now. You're working on helping yourself get better, and that's what matters. :)"
BPD,ew47nu9,t1_ew3ivp0,1565104695.0,"That sucks. :( I don't know what you have either and not trying to diagnose you or anything -- but some things that go with BPD are overwhelming, out-of-place anger, and an inability to regulate emotions.

Clearly this is something you want to fix, or you wouldn't be thinking about it at all. So I don't think it's about you having no empathy at all, it's just about these overwhelming emotions. When we feel too many emotions, we tend to shut down and stop feeling emotion at all because it's overwhelming. The point is, you're not a monster. 

Therapy is what helps the most for me. Meditation too, actually. Learning about various things I struggle with helped me too, like learning more about emotional regulation. It's all about being about to shift your reactions and perspective so that instead of immediately reacting to things with anger, you can take some time to stop and think and then say something calmly. I won't lie, it's really hard, for me. I still don't get it right most of the time, haha. But over the years I've gotten a little bit better at things a little at a time. And I know you can do it, too! I believe in you!

My partner and I are actually in a fight right now and haven't spoken since yesterday. It's like I always wait for the other person to say something first... Or I wait until it gets really bad to apologize. So I think I get what you mean. I'm so sorry you're going through this. Sending you hugs and support. ‚ô•Ô∏è Things will get better. Don't be afraid to ask for help."
