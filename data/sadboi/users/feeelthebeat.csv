I can answer more questions if you have them. Personally I found Phenibut better for social anxiety, Xanax better for the physical side effects of my anxiety (muscle tension, no appetite).

Also, the effect of Phenibut changes a lot with caffeine. Idk if you ever did the caffeine/Xanax combo but that was one of my favorite to get work done. Of course, the caffeine can increase anxiety so I’d only do it if I wanted to boost the social/euphoria aspects of the Phenibut"

“Since the early 1990s, the Department of Defense’s 1033 program has provided local law enforcement agencies access to military-grade equipment. This program, now expanded by President Trump after President Obama attempted to limit its use, allows local law enforcement agencies to receive excess Department of Defense equipment that would otherwise be destroyed because it was no longer useful to the military. Over 8,000 law enforcement agencies have utilized the 1033 program to access more than $6 billion worth of military equipment such as night-vision goggles, machine guns, armored vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers, and military aircraft.”

ketamine,f7a9xjp,t3_duzcjn,1573524140.0,"There are two isomers of Ketamine, and I find I prefer R- K. The other isomer, S-, I find tends to be more “trippy” and head high. R- gives me a more relaxing body high and completely melts my anxiety."
phenibut,f74w9tw,t1_f715y45,1573408951.0,"Hey, I used a website called nootropics Depot! There are a few websites that sell phenibut, you can definitely find them by searching this sub. 

What is currently ailing you? I personally use it as a way to not drink (working on cutting back on alcohol haha) cus if I drink on it I get wicked nausea. And also as a social drug tbh, like I said above I can get a stimulant effect if I stagger the doses and add caffeine :P 

Do be careful tho because it can be addicting!"
phenibut,f6zcfkf,t3_dtvt6e,1573314618.0,"Yes lol. Especially if I take it with caffeine. I find Phenibut can actually make me feel a bit of that mdma stimulant anxiety, it doesn’t really ever make me feel super sleepy lol. Funny how people respond so differently to this drug"
