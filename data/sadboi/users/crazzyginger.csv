AskReddit,fn9pc9g,t3_g08qmc,1586780983.0,"We are living in a distop√≠a that validates oppression of people simply because they were born. 

Our society is run on the backs of the poor so that the rich can have more money. 

Think about it, there is plenty of housing/shelter, yet there are people forced to live on the streets. We have warehouses full of food, yet people are starving. We have the means to make a much lesser impact on the world yet we choose to continue to make it inhabitable. 

All of this based on the power we give a green piece of paper and zeros and ones. And if you don't have that power your voice is not worth anything.

This keeps me up at night, hunched in corner crying out to be rescued..."

Their response to that information was not the best one. They may be displaying concern through anger. 
Find a teacher, director, coach, aunt, friends parent, older friend, an adult who you feel you can talk to about what happened, and mention you want to try therapy (if you want therapy, I highly recommended, therapy saved my life all through middle school and high school.)
Ask the adult to help you talk to your parents about how you are wanting help. A mediator between you and your parent/guardians will do wonders."
depression,f8bdv6b,t3_dzrccf,1574434475.0,"This statement is really rough. Something I had to learn for myself is I have to show myself love before I can truly accept and enjoy love from others. For me I show myself love by taking a shower, eating some healthy(ish) food, going in a 5-10-15 minute walk. Setting a time limit on how much I can lay around and do nothing. Sometimes I need a whole day, other times I need 2 hours.
It is extremely hard work, and it will be one of the bravest things you will do in your life.
Find all the ways you show yourself love and you prove to yourself that you are worth it! 



I have had depression my entire life and I suck with commitment, but I am about to move in with my SO of 4 years (on and off) and I can say our relationship is better because I learned to love myself."
