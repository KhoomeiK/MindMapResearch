asktransgender,ff6v9mo,t1_ff6s9za,1579635596.0,"I know exactly how you feel, dysphoria is never constant, some days it's really strong and some days it's just fine. 
I recommend seeing a medical professional tho, the dysphoria could be linked to something larger and sometimes transitioning doesn't help.
If there's anything neutral you can go by, like using only your name and no pronouns, I would strongly recommend it to see if you prefer it, especially before doing any medical transition. 
It's possible you might identify as non-binary instead (or also) to trans.
I really hope I've helped in some way ðŸ˜¥"
asktransgender,ff301vt,t1_ff2yn7r,1579530008.0,My issue is just that I've openly transitioned and I probably confuse everyone when they see me with facial hair
asktransgender,ff2yzan,t3_ercm20,1579529096.0,"First of all: your not a stupid teenager, you're obviously confused and I totally understand the feeling as I was the same.

What I'd recommend is to maybe start dressing androgenenously, maybe try going down a non-binary route for a bit and see how it feels (like changing pronouns to they/them, maybe finding a neutral name like Sam or Jo). If you're under 18 I don't think you'll be able to start medically transitioning anyway so it might be a good idea to put your toes in the water.

From the sounds of it, you have a confused or bad self image, which may be the route of the problem instead of being trans (but that doesn't mean your not trans, if you catch my drift). *See a doctor about the self harm* thats really important. It's quite easy to deflect into transgenderism as an easy escape, to just be anything but yourself. 

If these feelings have started recently I really recommend you don't start anything medical for a while. I had thoughts and dreams as you said for five+ years until I realised that I was trans. Self medicating as well is really dangerous.

Please don't take this the wrong way. Support is out there and you should get some. Gender identity is complicated and confusing and don't let anyone tell you your feelings are wrong. They aren't. ðŸ’•"

asktransgender,fdxxmow,t1_fdxjcr7,1578773929.0,"Dw I'm fine in terms of doctoring it was more of a family thing. Just gonna say don't use GenderGP, the head had her license removed for a bit for prescribing to a 12 year old, plus she's not an endocrinologist so she's not qualified to prescribe it. I use GenderCare, which is composed of the doctors from the GIC in London. 

Also for those in the UK, you can have NHS and private treatment at the same time. When you get private care the NHS moves you to the right part of their treatment (so if you get diagnosed and start hrt, the NHS will treat it like you did it through them and continue your treatment).

asktransgender,ey9m8p4,t3_cw6rxl,1566946764.0,"I would say, talk to someone medical about it. It's strange how you say you're not uncomfortable being a woman but then describe your discomfort to aspects of being a woman. You could try the transition socially at first, see how it feels and then move to a doctor (in the UK I'd reccomend sooner rather than later due to the waiting list) and again see how it feels in the time you wait for treatment.

At your age (I hate saying this) don't rush into it headfirst, try making slow transitions to see how you feel and then make another step if it feels better, or *more right*.

TransDIY,exu9pr0,t3_co4d8d,1566581082.0,"Sorry just putting this here after a bit of research (UK facts btw):  
GenderGP is a subscription service that in the long run costs the same as a private doctor from \*GenderCare\*. GenderGP is run by a GP called Helen Webberly, who got in trouble for prescribing **without a licence** *to a 12 year old*. Also because she hasn't specialised (is trained as a GP) I find it hard to trust her prescriptions.

Personally I would reccomend *GenderCare* because that is run by endocrinologists who are in the GIC's you are getting referred to anyway. Also they have a licence. The cost is around Â£300 for an initial consultation per doctor and Â£150 for any further with them. They also will work with your GP like GenderGP would.

Just thought I would put this here for anyone who sees the post again; my GP didn't want to work with Webberly because of the stuff in 2015."
