I’m a few months out of a relationship that was sexually abusive and when I dip my toe back in the dating pool I am going to be taking it VERY slowly before sleeping with anybody. 

It won’t mean I’m not attracted to the person, but being super careful with my physical boundaries is particularly important to me now... And even if it’s not because of anything traumatic, and she just prefers to take it slow because she is conservative: a month is really not that long. 

If you like her enough and sense she is attracted to you, then just wait."

Like insecure and completely oblivious to the cultural aspect of this - which is a bit of a red flag IMO. 

Next time he complains or makes a comment I suggest telling him that your family are not going to change or go away, and that many of his issues are with things linked to Indian culture (like the jewellery at weddings and whatnot) - so his constant criticism is not only rude and insensitive but simply not going to fly if he is interested in being with you long term. 

Alternatively - find a nicer boyfriend!"

In many instances for me it’s the feeling of really NOT wanting something to happen, that you think could happen, and then your body jumps ahead and responds as though it WILL happen.

Lack of fear has been linked to psychopathy, though there has been research that has cast doubt on that theory and suggested that psychopathy actually involves a limited ability to see danger..... there is also a disease called Urbach–Wiethe (hereditary) that apparently affects the part of the brain responsible for fear and can result in people feeling zero fear."

DecidingToBeBetter,fo6okul,t3_g61cs2,1587563639.0,"I think anything preceded by “I should” often triggers an inner rebellious teen in our subconscious that doesn’t like being told it “should” do anything (even if it’s good for us). “Should” can trigger guilt and shame, and these aren’t positive motivators.

Try to just connect with “what would feel good for me right now?”. If you sit with that question sometimes the answer is to watch trash on YouTube, and that’s okay! Other times you might sit with it and realise, actually, it would feel good to go for a walk or have a snack or read a book (or whatever). 

It might not be a buzzy motivation technique that will have you running a marathon in a month, but if you can work on it, it’s a sustainable, long-term perspective shift that will continually and quietly motivate you to do what feels best for you.

AmItheAsshole,fmeqox8,t3_fuunev,1586011335.0,"Going against the crowd here as I’m going to say NTA.   All relationships are different and for some women, their partner commenting on other women is okay. 

It has never been ok with me so I feel you - but luckily I’ve also never had a boyfriend that did it anyway. It’s just an unspoken rule for a lot of relationships - we KNOW our partners are going to find other people attractive, but it doesn’t need to be shared/expressed if you’re not comfortable with it. 

He’s not considering your feelings. If the pornstar pic was a meme as you said, then I still don’t think he needed to say he’s horny. He could have said “haha” and left it at that. The kid is insensitive.

Edited to add: don’t let a fear of being the “crazy girlfriend” stop you from setting healthy boundaries around what feels good/bad for you in a relationship. If you figure out how to set and maintain your boundaries in relationships now, your future self will thank you and it will help build your self esteem. Not wanting your partner to openly express his attraction to other women in front of you is not a crazy girlfriend request."

For decent quality (but not top end), I used to print on 300gsm paper (card-like stock), on a bright white linen blend paper. 

This was adequate for my needs and suited my work but it depends on your art style too. If your work is super intricate or delicate then a thinner, textured stock might be more suitable...

Highly recommend finding a printer in your area who you can talk to and who can show you physical samples of their different paper options so you can see and feel them yourself :)

I suspect it might come down to investment/interest in a job - or maybe that’s just me. I have a really good and well paying corporate job but i have no desire to throw in loads of extra hours either. As soon as it hits 5pm I am ready to go and unless under exceptional circumstances, I generally resent it if I get held there over time. 

On the other hand when I worked in a super creative role a few years back I would get so into my projects I would lose track of time and I didn’t clock how long I was working. I miss that feeling. So much more satisfying personally - but financially not so much. It just didn’t pay very well and I wanted to buy my own home. 

I have colleagues in the corporate scene who don’t have a passion outside of their role and their job IS that passion for them - which I guess is why they can happily put the hours in. Others seem to have a massive achievement complex where their self worth is tied to their sense of achievement at their job - which is what drives them to overwork."

He’s very proud so he won’t reach out to me again (probably a good thing at the moment while I’ve been shaky in the decision), but things ending so abruptly without a hug goodbye or even a “take care” hurts.

There is a pretty fertile market at the moment for people with skills that can be applied to that kinda thing.

I felt the exact same way when moving to Europe in my early 20s - I was meant to be loving every minute of it, yet I was so depressed I could barely get myself to leave the room I was renting. I then felt even worse because I was so guilty and angry at myself for not squeezing the juice out of the experience. It became a vicious cycle. I then spent too much money (my vice  was clothes) to try and lift my mood but this put financial pressure on that made me even more depressed.

If I could give advice to my younger self - and you by proxy - I would say: stop trying so hard to love the experience there and just focus on the little menial things you’re enjoying day to day. The taste of a pastry. A joke with friends. The tiny things you’d normally not notice. Take the pressure off yourself and stop expecting to be joyfully experiencing your lifelong dream - and take bite sized chunks of it to enjoy instead. Paris is an amazing city, try to relish the little details - and if you’re depressed and can’t relish them, then NOTICE them, which sometimes ends up feeling like the same thing.

relationship_advice,ff6c9l9,t1_fexfl5h,1579624050.0,"Hey this is a really delayed reply but in terms of advice for how to get through cutting contact without a support network.... take this as an opportunity to learn how to depend on yourself. It is not healthy for you or any future relationship you build, be it with her or anyone else, for you to depend on external sources heavily out of fear of being alone or to pull through difficult times.

No man is an island - that is true - but to be able to weather a storm when you are by yourself is an extremely good quality to cultivate, because sometimes we all have times in our life when we are caught in a hard time alone and need to pull ourselves through. It will build your confidence too because you will realise no matter what happens with a relationship you will be ok, because you can rely on yourself to pull through. It takes the pressure off the other person, too. 

As for your social issues - I have felt the same in the past, I am naturally extremely shy and have had social anxiety to some degree or another since I was a teen...But know this kind of thing is not stationary, or set in stone. You can work to become more engaged socially and to find situations less awkward over time. But it’s exactly that - work. The only way to do it is to put yourself in awkward situations to begin with - exposure therapy. Again this will build your resilience and confidence over time even if you have awkward, cringey experiences. I’ve been there.

You don’t even have to do this for now though as it might be too overwhelming to begin with. You can start with getting comfortable being on your own and not reaching out to this girl instinctively. Read, go to the gym, put extra energy into work, spend your time constructively to crowd out any idle time you might end up dwelling on her.

This girl is using you but you’re blind to it because you love her. It doesn’t mean she is a bad person or intentionally wanting to hurt you but it does mean you should take a big step back and start building your confidence and resilience away from your relationship with her."
relationship_advice,ff5wo7v,t3_erug7z,1579612755.0,"This happened to me once. You just have to go back to your life and keep living it until eventually the ghosting becomes a bad dating story you feel detached from. It takes time but you do get over it - though you’ll perhaps always have a small niggling feeling that pops up when you think of the person and you wonder “why??”. You just have to carry the unanswered questions and keep going. 

I think some people are just afraid of - or really uncomfortable with - conflict, and are afraid of hurting the other person/having to directly see or deal with that hurt, and so disappearing feels like an easier way out than responsibly facing up to that, and an easier way out than dealing with the discomfort being upfront would bring *them*. Doesn’t make it right of course."
relationship_advice,fewb4o1,t3_eqrj35,1579407819.0,"You should probably cut contact with her entirely (including muting her social media accounts etc.) for awhile. It kind of sounds like she’s doing the monkey bar thing - not fully letting go of one relationship until another is established.. which isn’t fair on you. 

Her ending things and then maintaining such a close relationship with you is also not fair and confusing/blurring the lines. You will not be able to move on if you stay in touch with her for the time being. Cut ties for awhile so you can try to move forward before you’re working with her again."
relationship_advice,feqbra3,t1_fepv76r,1579339903.0,Thanks for this. I guess because of all his other good qualities I found it really hard to reconcile them with this side of him that literally doesn’t care about my physical boundaries - but it’s good to be reminded that his good side doesn’t outweigh that. Tbh I think it’s going to be a long time before I can stomach sex with anybody because it went on for so long.
relationship_advice,fep72if,t3_eqabmx,1579313595.0,This is a red flag. He prioritised clubbing with the boys over ensuring his girlfriend got home safe. Not a good sign for a long term partner.. it seems extreme to say break up because of this but if he has ditched you in this scenario I’m thinking there’s probably other incidents where he hasn’t prioritised you? If he was hellbent on clubbing he could have ordered you an uber off his phone or waited with you until the bus came at the very least.

selfimprovement,feglvza,t3_ep2ibv,1579096764.0,"There is nothing wrong with being an introvert and it’s
not something you need to get over. It just seems that way as the world more openly celebrates extroverts. 

If it’s shyness you experience (often goes hand in hand with being an introvert) that is something you can get better at pushing past. I am an introvert and naturally very shy but I’ve learnt how to “fake” being less so to the point where I actually DO feel less shy now. 

It isn’t easy though - you have to keep pushing yourself through “exposure therapy”, doing things that make you nervous or uncomfortable (I used to be too shy to call for a pizza...! Then I got a job as a receptionist while I was studying and having to answer calls and greet people all the time helped me move past the fear). In the meantime be kind to yourself and don’t feel like you have to rush to be any different than you are. If the world was full of extroverts it would be a nightmare! We need a balance of all different personality types :)"
relationship_advice,fegig6r,t3_ep1yzq,1579093774.0,"IMO it is COMPLETELY understandable and normal that you would wonder seeing as you’ve been together since you were teenagers and have only been with each other. But honestly, to have an amazing sex life after 8 years and two kids together is like a relationship unicorn - something many people in long term relationships (even happy ones!) don’t have, or don’t have consistently, and it makes me think you have a great thing going and can rest assured you are not really missing out on much, bar the experience of other people which can be overrated. Sex with a new person is often awkward and dissatisfying (not always, but often), and while the thrill of the unfamiliar can seem appealing it wears off."
relationship_advice,fecr57g,t1_fe9qmqf,1578981521.0,"You asked at the end what to do if her BF came back over so I thought it was an issue. Regardless she was in the wrong for shaming you for being who you are and you’re within your right to be upset about it. Maybe when things have calmed down and she’s not on a mood you can try telling her “when you said XYZ it made me feel extremely hurt , please can you not shame me for my personality”... or write a letter. However she doesn’t sound as though she’s sensitive to your feelings so may not be receptive.. how old is she?? She sounds like a teenager."
relationship_advice,fe9onjw,t3_eo7x8g,1578940052.0,"If her bf doesn’t come back or ends things it’s because he’s not into her. That’s not on you. Even if you did act strangely (and doesn’t even sound like you really did),  people don’t just end things with a new bf/gf because of one family member acting unusually. Her making a big deal about it would give anybody a bit of a complex and make them feel stranger than they even are. Just remain polite to the guy if he keeps coming around, and you do you."
relationship_advice,fdjzig3,t1_fdjy8is,1578492227.0,"I know it sounds that way. I’m normally great at talking things out with people and being upfront but over the course of our relationship I almost completely gave up on trying to discuss any issues with him, as I would get nothing but super defensive responses from him (“well YOU do THIS” kind of thing - or flat out denial. It was painfully frustrating).

So perhaps that’s part of why I’m reluctant to bring it up. I also suspect he will get nasty and say things to hurt me - he knows my weak spots and I am admittedly scared of what barbs he will throw at me. 

So yeah, I am flat out am terrified of a) hurting him and b) the reaction that will yield. I get it though, I just need to do it."

As someone who was a 13 year old diary-keeping girl once upon a time, it would be horrifyingly embarrassing to have my mum read my private expressions. Resist the urge, respect her privacy, and monitor her some other way."
AmItheAsshole,fcn54c0,t3_ei3nv4,1577803513.0,NTA. Attraction is super personal and you’re allowed to find certain people / qualities / bodies attractive or unattractive. I’ve tried to make myself be attracted to someone I wasn’t attracted to and it completely warped my feelings toward sex etc. because of it (in a really negative way). These things shouldn’t be forced out of a sense of obligation to be nice.
Anxiety,fc2uq80,t3_efwfut,1577374574.0,"Totally get this. I’d say mine is mostly under control now but I still half avoid any trips that will require a long drive as I’m paranoid about car crashes - and if I do go on a road trip I have to drive myself (can’t let a friend drive as I can’t handle not having that control :/). However previously it was so bad that I was in tears at the airport before leaving for a three week European holiday to see friends overseas, because I was so certain something bad was going to happen.

A tactic I have found to help (which helps with any form of anxiety I think) is to keep a notebook and record every time you get anxious over travel (e.g. whenever you think you’re going to die or have an accident etc.). Over time you’ll have enough entries built up that you will be able to see the pattern, how things have ended up ok after every anxiety hit, and the silliness of some of the thoughts, which helps put it into perspective.."

infp,f60gk10,t3_dq4gd5,1572616675.0,"Yup. Took me ages to bite the bullet and buy a home. I was terrified at the thought I would be tied to one spot. But then I realised that my habit of idealising everything was keeping me from being happy - and that even though prior to buying my place I could run  away anywhere I wanted at any time - doing that was unlikely to yield some far flung sense of happiness. 
I’ve learnt being anchored by a responsibility can actually be a very grounding thing. And I LOVE having my own home (without housemates) to hermit in...Though I still get swept up in a wave of panic when I watch a French film and realise I can’t just move to Paris on a whim 🙄"
depression,f5wsatl,t1_f5kxwwg,1572529727.0,"This sounds really similar to what I went through at 24 (I’m 30 now). I moved states to be with someone who I thought was my forever person. My entire idea of and plans for my future orbited around the presumption we would be together. When it ended it was like my entire sense of the world and my life crumbled and the rug had been pulled out from under me. I was ashamed to move back home too. By admitting to everyone we were over made it more real than I wanted to accept at the time. But I didn’t know where else to go or what to do, so I did end up back home. 

Not only was I mourning him and what we had, but the entire future I thought I was going to have with him. I actually think that was harder than losing the relationship itself - I felt completely unanchored and had to build a new reality from scratch again. It was so fucking hard. I too suffer from anxiety / depression and things like this don’t exactly help. 

It took me two years to fully recover. But during those two years even though I had terrible lows, I still managed to have fun, travel, make friends, and rebuild my sense of self without him tied to it. Now it’s all just a memory. So I get it. I really do. But you will heal. It will take time and you will continue to feel pain for some time - but I promise you will make it to the other side.

Biggest advice (besides ensuring you keep routines) is to delve into something you love doing or have always wanted to do, if you can. I taught myself a craft while healing from the heartbreak (as a way to channel the pain) and it ended up becoming a side business that I have earned decent side $$ from and met so many amazing people through. It became the silver lining to what I thought was a life-ruining event x"
depression,f5kv0we,t3_do8w50,1572270334.0,"Hey I’m so sorry you’re in such a tough place tight now. Heartbreak, especially when you’re in an already fragile position, is absolutely crushing. I have been there and honestly I don’t think there is anything you can do to stop this pain at the moment. You have to live your way through it. And it’s horrible. But you WILL make it out to the other side so hold onto that knowledge. Definitely try to keep up a good routine and keep going to work (keep to a schedule). I say that because I find that having too much time on my hands and being idle during a time like that, when prone to anxiety and depression, is not a good combo. A routine anchors you when your emotions are chaotic. 

Hang in there and know the pain WILL fade and ease. It will also make you a stronger, more resilient and empathetic person. Sending strength x

Edited to add: I was across country when my “big breakup” happened too, with no friends or family. I moved back. Having that support base is important - is moving back home an option??"

Then I caught up with my family that night after spending the day alone. It was actually really nice!

depression,f3pczzt,t1_f3mi0wm,1571055302.0,"It sounds like maybe you need to find a new therapist because the right one will not be hit and miss. It can be a difficult process to find the right fit though, and exhausting retelling your trauma to different people, so I understand if that’s not an option. It took me a long time to find the right person. 

Is moving away an option, for a fresh start away from your family? The fact he is still connected to the family would be terribly triggering - blaming his drinking is so dismissive of his complete violation - it’s no wonder you feel anxious :( 

And I completely understand that when you feel bad it’s nearly impossible to grasp that the future can feel any different (even if you cognitively understand that, emotionally it’s hard to). 

Sending you strength to move through this time of your life and to find your way to a place where you can heal."

It sounds like you are trying to cope with the event on your own - a good psychologist or counsellor may be able to provide you with a sense of safety and support that you’re not getting elsewhere  and tools to work through this hard time. You also didn’t mention much about how your family reacted to the event - did your sister leave her husband?? If not and he’s still involved with your family I expect that would be a huge stressor. 

I’m so sorry you feel like this and that you went through what you did. If it’s of any comfort - you are very young, and this time in your life and the horrible thing that happened to you does not have to define your future."

She might have social anxiety, be shy, or just take a long time to warm up to people. She might also - god forbid - prefer to keep work and her social life separate. 

You should not be forcing staff to be friends - the outcome/ quality of work and a harmonious team should be the main goal."
