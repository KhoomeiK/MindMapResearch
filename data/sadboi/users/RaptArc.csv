Without congressional authorization, donated money is deposited into the general fund of the Department of Treasury.‚Äù We contacted the Department of Treasury to find out if documentation for any such deposits is publicly available and have yet to hear back.""

So there's no official evidence that he's done it. It's tough, because a lot of things in this administration are on hear-say, and I think it's one of the reasons it's divided people so much. If from the beginning you believe him and people with prestige back him up verbally (no evidence), then you think it's been reinforced because all of these people should be reliable. Then you have the other people on the other side who won't believe without evidence and those people just keep going further away in the other direction. The issue here is that these things *can* be proven, but for the most part the government has shown no desire to qualm the concerns of those asking for evidence (which is a reasonable thing to ask for, I think).

Even still, what concerns me more is the idea that if it's legal it's okay and should be supported by the people (correct me if I'm wrong) even if it's ethically wrong. I know I kinda just put words in your mouth, but your last comment seemed like you support those actions despite understanding that they're not ethical. I get your point in that what is legal is fair game, because, well, it's a fact. But that doesn't mean it's a good thing. Right now and for a long time, before 2016, the government has has bad apples with power that warp the laws, continuing to screw over the common man. If we let them go because they made the rules that make it legal for them to make these unethical decisions then we're screwing ourselves over. We can't support people like that, for our own good.

This means investors are more likely to invest in that stock of Canned Corn Co. but there are several factors that we don't consider, such as the companies that depend on this stock (or vise versa). For example, if the canned goods industry runs out of aluminum it could screw over not just the corn but any good that purchases their canning material (from this specific company). That aluminum stock could potentially affect beans, sweet potatoes, etc. And some companies invest that strength in more than one way. The DOW, for example, can extract petroleum - which is then also invested into producing plastic, given that the petroleum that produces plastic is so easily accesible to the DOW. (Ever wonder why purchasing plastic is overly accessible? It's in everything! And that's just a smart company strategy. Now the DOW is likely to be purchased from always until they can't invest is plastics any more) This inter-connection between companies can be applied to anything, meaning that if the DOW has a problem with its plastic sector then companies that sell rice, beans, etc would enter a panic as they look for a new supplier to transport their goods. This too can affect stocks, which is supposed to be where the Wallstreet guys are supposed to do their job. Ideally they're ""in the know"" enough to analyze what would make a good investment and what wouldn't. Of course for certain stocks the gains or losses will depend on flimsy things like the weather (agriculture), or even fads ( suddenly Marvel is *huge* üò±). In the end, reading the stock market is about trying to read the economy as well, and that's just a deeply complex question to answer (there's a reason we can study micro and macro economics). If we had an formula for the economy we wouldn't have black Mondays, or great depressions (with the exception of corruption, which has proven to not give a fuck if the common man is sinking). Of course we do have great economic examples to look to (looking at you, Europe), which give us some of the most important guidelines for what we know needs to be done to balance the economy. Some stock like the DOW, which has their hands in so many things, is usually a sure investment (that's why it's used as a general indicator for how the dollar is doing). 

So in short, the better a company is doing (like if suddenly everyone only wants to buy at home depot because they found out Lowe's was anti-humanitarian and supports Moscow Mitch, then suddenly home depot's stock value rises while Lowe's tanks) 

Does that answer your question?"

From a [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/trump-swam-in-mob-infested-waters-in-early-years-as-an-nyc-developer/2015/10/16/3c75b918-60a3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html) article: ""They‚Äôre also a boon to oil companies and other corporations that kill vast numbers of birds.""  

And for those who don't know: Plastic is made from petroleum -> lots of petroleum is owned by the DowJ, which also makes plastic (convenient when it's your oil).

Eliminating excess plastic should be easy. How is it cheaper or more efficient for every company to pay extra in order to have their stuff wrapped in plastic? Why are we wrapping cucumbers in plastic? We used to purchase things without so much disposable stuff. We took jars with us and weighed our grain. It didn't make sense to me until I understood that the DowJ was involved. And they're not just involved in plastics, they've got a slew of things (that's why they're the Dow) and have their hands meddling into our politics as well. It's the reason this is so hard to beat. We need everyone involved.

I can relate to that, heavily. üòÇ I started  talking to my friend the other day and he expressed a similar sentiment while we happened to be talking about plastics and the general decay of our planet. Like, in the grand scheme, what can we do that would matter? And we ended up agreeing that we would be down to start something even if it doesn't work about, just because not doing anything seems so much worse. We decided we're going to go door to door around our neighborhoods (which are mostly filled with people who could care less about climate change) to talk to our neighbors. Like, straight up, take the time to talk about it together - but of course we want to go in prepared before making these visits, ideally with key points and a guideline for us to work with. It's been about a month and we haven't gotten thaaat much progress done because we both work, but the fact that we're both working actively on something we care about, no matter what comes of it in the end, has made us significantly happier, even if it means that for now we're just reading articles or watching documentaries. 

Maybe you don't care about the environment, but I think this is as good a time as any to inspire yourself to care. There are several good articles and documentaries as well (the Plastics episode from the series Broken, on Netflix, is absolutely fantastic). And it's not just the environment that needs attention. If you're into politics, or activism, there are groups you can meet up with or do volunteer work for. You can make new friendships with people who are similarly interested and you would be serving that higher calling, as you would be helping people in an indirect way.

Anyways, sorry for the long post. I just hope you'll find something that can help you like I've found this to help me. ‚úåÔ∏è"

It's helpful to try and get to the root of your feelings because without doing so you won't be able to face those feelings/issues.

I may not be giving you a clear understanding so I'll make up an easy example : if your brother pushes you and that makes you angry towards them - that anger is you attempting to process the sadness that you feel by his gesture (you may feel put down, disrespected, etc)
