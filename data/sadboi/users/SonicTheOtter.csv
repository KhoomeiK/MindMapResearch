In another class, another classmate of mine tries to get me to say who I'm taking to the dance with me. I say no one and I didn't even notice this poor girl who had a crush on me sat right behind me. Then apparently she's goes off crying and I get called terrible by all the girls.

ModernMagic,fngi4c3,t1_fngdune,1586932956.0,"Those aren't all the decks. This also isn't to say they were the strongest decks. Despite their performance in comparison to say Jund or the rest of the meta, they existed and they are being repressed from really existing at all. There are other decks but what I'm trying to say is that the format is in a way devoid of black decks because of them being repressed to fringe due to a card that disallows their interaction for too little a cost. Format warping cards like this push out other decks that otherwise would exist in a healthier more diverse meta.

Jund is seeing all the success for exactly what you said in that it has new cards in it's disposal which allows the deck to adapt. Jund has more endgame now with kroxa and is grindier than ever before with kroxa, w6, and klothys. Jund has the ability to provide pressure from angles other decks lack which has allowed it to survive. Although with this said, I'm glad at least one bgx deck was able to survive in this cruel green skewed meta."
absoluteunit,fnfvqdg,t3_g12hpl,1586916490.0,Is this the power of GMOs?
ModernMagic,fnak1j1,t1_fn9m0sh,1586798849.0,"I also play bgx. I also played against it in standard with Esper hero. You should know how stupid it is for one green mana to counter a thoughtseize, any removal spell outside of bolt/path, fulminator mage activations, Lili activations, and more. The card even replaces itself for it. Anything relevant we try to interact with green decks is most likely countered by this. In blue this is paired with force of negation and in a blue mirror this is a one mana counter your counter that draws you a card.

Playing esper hero, I had to either land a 3feri or Unmoored ego veil everytime or it would win the game for them. That's how fustrating it is to deal with a card that invalidates two colors in the game and makes a u/b, heavy black, or heavy blue colored deck basically unplayable as green continues to dominate the format. 

Titan and bant control are strong on their own yes. But veil puts them further above any black deck or blue deck not running green. Bant would be much easier of a match for bgx if veil was gone. We eat MUs like this all day. Titan for bgx on the other hand is trickier. But we should still have a chance with the interaction we have. Veil takes this chance away from us and the MU becomes a lot worse if not unsurmountable. 

Even decks like storm and ad nauseum I hear are splashing green to fit veil in so it can protect their combos. If that's not a problem sign for the card, I don't know what is. This problem sign also showed when decks were all splashing for Oko (ex. GDS). It's not a coincidence all the top decks are using veil."
ModernMagic,fn8zwsd,t1_fn8x9i3,1586754958.0,"There was a lot that happened in the format this past year (hogaak, kci, etc.) so maybe not all of those were the strongest decks then but they existed within the format. Now with veil existing they are suppressed without the chance to come back out into the format. This is now showing in Jund and GDS which have been at the top of the meta since then.

What is going to happen in the format if veil is banned you may ask? More black decks showing up in more prominence is a possibility, but not a guarantee. What is pretty much a guarantee however is black decks having more of a chance to interact effectively against the green decks of the format. Green is apparent in its dominance in the format and while veil is in the format, answers that can combat these green decks are being completely nullified with just a green mana also replacing itself which is the biggest problem when it comes to the card. This is the reason why it's being dubbed the ""a green cryptic command"". Drawing the card is the other big factor to the card as it's better than [[Autumn's Veil]]  in every way. I have no memory since or if at all Autumn's Veil saw any play in modern.

If you can't imagine how powerful this card is, imagine a blossoming defense that drew a card. Imagine how powerful a card like that would make infect.

Edit: Autumn's Veil not Veil of Autumn"

Astrolabe is any snow mana you want to get out any color of mana you need. Astrolabe breaks the mechanic of snow mana itself allowing any fixing you want as long as you play snow lands. It doesn't even cost you anything since it replaces itself. This is an artifact which makes it harder to interact with and completely evades any mana disrupting hate. Let's face it already. This card is broken as long as snow stays relevant and it's damaging the format in ways where decks that are able to take advantage of it have an edge over the meta. This card was already banned in pauper and I don't see how this will be good if we leave it alone in both Modern and Legacy.

Pauper was an example of how a deck that was able to take advantage of the card to the point where other decks without it were at a clear disadvantage. Decks weren't able to punish a 5 color deck enough in pauper. We're not even able to effectively do it enough in Modern and Legacy. It's only a matter of time before these formats find a multi-colored deck (Niv to light, amulet, etc.) to break with a new card that tips it over board. But I'd like to argue that it wouldn't be the fault of the new card but the enabler of a greedy manabase that allows the deck to become uncounteractable. 

Excuse my rambling but I think astrolabe will get hit eventually as the format continues to warp around it and other greedy manabases. Niv to light will live without astrolabe as it was fine without it before and other decks will be okay but snow decks will take a hit along with the banning of astrolabe if it happens."

I have a wide variety of decks from control to burn and if we take time playing every deck we can get, eventually we'll get closer to what we want to play most. That being said, don't be afraid to try out decks and play as many of them as possible. It'll take a while because I don't know about you but I can't afford every deck in the meta lol"

animenocontext,fj6ndel,t3_fbpe7w,1583076073.0,"It amazes me that people are getting so upset over a character who is one of the big parts of the comedic relief in the series. Mineta is also a character that is set with a lot fear in a frightening world. Having that side to a character/s to some degree I believe is key to setting up a more realistic world. Honestly without a character like Mineta, this series wouldn't be as entertaining without at least the small bit of comedy that Mineta provides for the series. I can understand not liking the character but as a character in the series he deserves more credit than he gets."
spikes,fj514je,t3_fbdyw0,1583021726.0,"I hate how when I go from calm to extremely anxious when I'm close to winning. The last tourney I played in I was on burn and my opponent on miracles. Game 3 I had them in bolt range with them only having counter balance in play. Cast rift bolt on the upkeep to get them to 3 knowing they have ponder on top with the counterbalance trigger. Top deck a bolt and my hand immediately points it to their face but I stare at my card shaking going ""oh shit"" and they flip the ponder again knowing in my head it was there but my body wanted this game to be over so bad. Afterwards I got 3 lands in a row and die to entreat the angels miracled. Rip"
LavaSpike,fifgw5s,t3_f7ulh5,1582389683.0,"I've always liked rip because it accomplishes the same function as Leyline but you being able to cast it is big. If you draw it later, it's still very useful as it gets rid of the gy on etb. 

Unlike with Leyline (we couldn't cast it anyways but still). Rip isn't the end all be all in the discard matchups anyways either so if they take the rip you still have your burn that they're going to have to deal with. Against dredge rip can come down early enough on the play. On the draw I think we just have to hope. The matchup isn't in our favor. If they have it by turn 2 they have it. If you have Leyline out they will wait until they hit a claim so you're not exiling anything either at that point. I would recommend rip still but feel free to give Leyline a go."

LavaSpike,fic1azi,t1_fibbz6n,1582335145.0,"Oh boy, that sounds like a blast lol."
LavaSpike,fial9lw,t1_fiakrol,1582303375.0,I've seen a post on this subreddit before with a link to it but it didn't work. Would you happen to have a link to it friend?
LavaSpike,fiahoyn,t1_fiagjwu,1582301259.0,"I'll give the PoPs a try but I'll have to see if I need to cut them what I'll bring in instead. And yeah, I definitely forgot about bridge. I'll have to think about it though. Graveyard hate is supposed to be the mo right now so I'll have to deliberate which slots I devote what to and what I hope to dodge. But thanks in all. I don't feel half as lost anymore."
LavaSpike,fiadi70,t1_fiacf3t,1582298766.0,"It always feels bad when people play around PoP especially with wasteland but, hasn't that always been the case in Legacy? Also if Eldrazi is rising in popularity what is recommended against them? We don't have many options when it comes to dealing with threats."
LavaSpike,fi90wxp,t1_fi8znsy,1582252935.0,"What do you think of Pyrostatic pillar? I play one main to hedge against storm and delver and then 3 in the side because it worked against many legacy decks for me in the past. 

I'm a bit unsure on numbers because everyone is running different numbers both in main and in the side nowadays. You even say 4 copies of price aren't even being played in the main anymore which confuses me. Are we sacrificing speed now to run more 3s? Is 20 mountains the new standard for the manabase? 

I'm confused on a few things since I haven't played legacy in a while but I'm willing to change to fight a more Oko meta since I know it's popular in legacy and I know how good it was in modern."
LavaSpike,fi8y7ii,t1_fi8wskb,1582251121.0,"Yeah, that's true. Would you consider putting two more Firecraft in the side?"
