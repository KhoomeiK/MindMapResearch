AnimalsBeingDerps,fqwg6fl,t1_fqw38g4,1589703249.0,"I have an English bulldog that is extremely healthy.. 
took me almost 2 years to find a great breeder, across the country, and I followed a previous litter from them grow up to see how healthy they would become. 
His face and nose  is a little longer so he doesn’t have really bad breathing issues. Snores loud sometimes but other times he’s fine. I wipe his few wrinkles and that’s all I have to do, among just other regular dog cleaning. 
It depends on the breeder. Yeah there are bad breeders who go way too far with it, and it’s wrong. But there are also good breeders with a long history of very healthy dogs and gene generations. 

So to say “anyone” is such BS. I’ve had golden retrievers, Australian shepherds, German shepherds and Bassett hounds growing up. My bulldog has less maintenance than any of them. He’s full of energy, Is very smart, SO lovable and kind and has the best personality I’ve ever seen in a dog."
Bulldogs,fqo0t22,t1_fqnpc6k,1589505245.0,"So he doesn’t tear apart your house and piss and shit everywhere too. It’s also to protect him from hurting himself. It’s their “Den” they feel safe and protected. It’s also used to potty train them 

However, I don’t shut or lock the cage. I did when he was a puppy because he would literally get into wires and potty everywhere. Now it’s just like his bed and he sleeps and naps there himself, I don’t even put him in there haha. They like it though"
Bulldogs,fqndoyk,t1_fqn9kay,1589493012.0,"I found a big thick fluffy comforter for him that was way more comfortable and bed like and that helped a ton. And if he ever peed on it , I took my time washing it and made him sleep on the hard pad in the crate for 1-2 days so he would learn it’s not as comfortable. Also, a treat every time I take him outside to pee so he learned outside is his potty and not blankets or inside. Find a super thick comforter for your puppy though that he can sink into and be comfortable on. Eventually he’ll just kindof grow out of it as long as you never bring back to pads"
Bulldogs,fqn79on,t1_fqmp9lq,1589489860.0,"Pee pads are the worst thing ever. It set pumba back a few times with his training and it took him months to finally stop peeing on any blankets I left out or any clothes/towels on the floor. I finally can get an area rug for my living room. I had an issue for a short time with the blankets in his crate too but I think after enough times of sleeping on the hard surface, he realized the blankets way better haha"

Work our hard as hell and sweat that shit out. Then keep chugging water and piss like 20 times before the test. 

If you chug water and sweat like a MF, you should be good. I’ve had tons of ETG tests and have drank 25 beers 55 hours before a test. A full beer 14 hours before. In your case, you’re like right at the fine line. Go at the last possible second as well"

Bulldogs,fqlc3e1,t1_fqlbj0z,1589453541.0,Thanks! Yes he is very healthy. Took me a long time to find a great breeder with no bad/gross practices and where the parents and past litters stay healthy. Vet says he’s one of the healthiest Ebulldogs she’s seen!

sales,fkbckw3,t1_fka6z01,1584030484.0,"Thanks man. Lot of good stuff in here. I actually know all of the other guys material they use and I know more about the products than probably anyone in my area - I actually work for my family business so I stay on top of it all lol. They’re all pitching an economy level product. And they’re super small companies with like 3-4 employees only so they don’t have a ton of overhead and they use the customers down payment to go order the material vs us stocking and making the stuff. And yeah we’re the luxury product in the area. I love the advice about making sure I control the sale. That part I can definitely practice better. 

I reacted a little in shock the first couple of times hearing these other quotes and just told the customers “honestly that’s alarming they could price this job out so cheap. It’s a little too good to be true. I hope they brought samples” and they never bring samples. So I use that to my advantage and I do cover all of the ways of how we operate and everything like you mentioned but I feel like I could’ve reacted better to it by basically completely blowing them off and going right back to talking about what I have to offer. Like you said in the end, some of these guys just want a bottom barrel price. Can’t win em all. 

It’s only happened a couple of times in the last few weeks but I usually close at a very high rate, above 50 percent, so when I lose a job I get pissed and gotta figure out everything I could’ve done better. Thanks for all the good advice here though!! 

And how do you usually sell your financing? Out of all of our sales guys, I sell the most financing. Probably 70 percent of my contracts are financed so I have a decent pitch at it now but would love to hear other ways to try as well"

socialanxiety,fhk5ept,t3_f3olsq,1581667617.0,"Something I’ve been dealing with too and I’m in sales lol. However I’ve been working on it over the last year and have improved drastically, that now I might just have 1 or 2 moments where I stumble over myself in a conversation. A lot of it is due to confidence. Lack of creates the anxiety and then causes you to stumble. You gotta learn to control the conversation and be the alpha. No matter who you talk to. This takes time and practice and most importantly, preparation. 

So fix what makes you lack confidence. For me, it was my appearance and built up shame from my past behaviors. I got back into the gym and gained 40lbs. Got super healthy. I fixed my teeth. I committed to my job and started making good money. I changed up my entire wardrobe. I focused on all of the things that would make me feel like a loser. This is the preparation. Now when I’m in a group of people like all my friends from HS, I’m the biggest guy, I make the most money, drive the nicer vehicle, I’m the “alpha”. I’m always prepared before everything I do now so I have absolutely no reason to feel anxious when I’m talking. So pick out your biggest flaws, and fix them. This is gonna be the most important. 

Then, listen and watch good speakers on YouTube. Learn the way they talk, body language and all that. I like to listen to Kobe Bryant’s :( mentality interviews. It takes a lot of effort and patience but you will be so happy you did."

Feel like some people are gonna suggest staying up. Don’t. I have had horrible sleep issues my whole life and finally can sleep normal now. Once in awhile I have a restless night if I drink a preworkout late or something. I’ve done both many times, staying up or getting just a quick 1-3 hours in.

I still take focalin as needed once in awhile but I don’t take meds daily anymore. Sure it helps with some things but I realized I needed my personality and the ability to social a lot more in my life to succeed than just being hyperfocused onto something.

I taught mine a combination of sit, paw, other paw, spin and down in a row within 2-3 days. After he got it down, I had him do it in reverse in 1 try. Took me 3 tries of carrying him to his cage and explaining why for me to now be able to say “ok bud i gotta go to work let’s go” and he runs to his cage the first time I say it. Only problem is , you gotta give them a treat. He stopped doing what I taught him shortly after I stopped giving him treats. He literally refused lol. Sometimes if he’s being a pain during a walk and I’m trying to get him back inside and to follow me, I’ll go into my pocket and pull out a closed fist. He thinks it’s a treat and he listens.

Invisalign,fetta0j,t3_eqltap,1579379813.0,"By the way, my teeth were definitely pretty yellow but NOT that yellow lol. I used to chew tobacco and I assume I took this picture after I chewed and didn’t brush yet or something. At that time I wasn’t really brushing as religiously as I do now either. My teeth shifted after highschool and i let them go pretty bad. Due to my bite, I would grind the hell out of my teeth and I badly wore them down as you can see. It makes me super self conscious but I’m finally at a point where I’m feeling a lot better about my teeth. 

Can’t wait to get my teeth bonded. I’m so close. I’m so freaking excited. My teeth literally have caused me so much anxiety and self consciousness. This has been a long 2 year journey. The hardest part has definitely been the crossbite. It was bad. I didn’t really begin to see major progress with it until a couple months ago. And even now, if I leave my trays out any longer than a quick meal, my crossbite moves back a little bit to where those 4 teeth will just sit on top of each other. It’s super annoying, but with how quickly it’s been moving, I assume another month or 2 and it will be fully corrected."

Never love again is ok, Depends on my mood when I listen to it. 
In too deep I don’t really like with the album. Might listen to in a certain mood once in awhile but idc for it 
Little engine isn’t something I like that much right now but I can see it growing on me. 
Leaving heaven is decent. Good chill song. I wouldn’t skip it when it comes on. 
Darkness I had a hard time trying to like at first. I just couldn’t get with the beat/feel until I got into a mindful mood. But It’s a very good song. Anyone saying it’s as good or better than Stan is just being a fanboy. I’d put it on the level of like bad guy. 

Premonition is dope. 
Unaccommodating is good when Ems verse comes on. Young ma sucks on it but it makes ems part that much better. 
You Gon Learn is dope. Royce kills it. Em follows it up. These two together are always unreal. 
Godzilla is awesome. Just gives me some serious energy. 
Yah Yah is a great old school / boom bap type of song. Hate the chorus but the verses are dope from everyone. Chorus will make me probably skip this song in the car most of the time. 
Marsh is dope. I like the beat a lot and it just goes hard. Something I’ll listen to at the gym. 
Lock it up is awesome. I’m surprised this song isn’t getting as much love. Up there as being my favorite song on the album. Paak kills it and em just matches it perfectly. 
No regrets is good. Has a good vibe to it. It’s not something I’m going to pick to play but when it comes up on the playlist, I’m going to enjoy it 
I will is good. Great slaughterhouse song and good chorus. Everyone kills it. 

So far, I’m not sure where I can rank this right now. I have to listen to it a bit more. I like it a lot, definitely not disappointed. Without a doubt better than revival. Kamikaze grabbed me a little harder when it first came out but I’m already bored of it so I’ll probably put it ahead of Kamikaze. I’d probably put this in between recovery and MMLP2."
Eminem,feqnkwv,t3_eq27ik,1579343986.0,Amazing song. One of the best on the album
Eminem,feqnj2g,t1_fepifk3,1579343965.0,"I’m a huge em fan, love every album but revival honestly was trash. I haven’t listened to it since he came out with all of his new music."
Eminem,feqghc6,t1_fep3bnl,1579341591.0,He totally should have had a Joyner feature
Eminem,feqevza,t1_feo8oxc,1579341068.0,Yeah thought the same thing. It’s definitely another girl
Eminem,feqecap,t3_eq26u3,1579340827.0,"Felt the new album coming for a little while. He dropped a bunch of features right before he dropped Kamikaze too. Anyway, it’s fire 🔥"

phenibut,fefyuff,t1_fefunff,1579069887.0,"Yep I have the same fear. What make me so mad about the anxiety is I’m a good looking guy, I’m pretty built and go to the gym 4-5 days a week, I have a great job, I’m already fairly successful and even though I don’t ever try to lean on this and don’t want to sound douchey but my father is a multimillionaire businessman and I’m the heir to the business. Like wtf is wrong with me lol. I was popular back in highschool and i got with most of the girls, and continued to for a few years after. Until about 2 years ago. I was always able to ignore my anxiety with those girls because I was “cool” in HS and it made it easy. Ever since that ended, my anxiety really gets in the way of me being happy. Luckily phenibut really seems to be helping me out and I’m trying new things and going out of my comfort zone more and more"
phenibut,feeb4gs,t1_feeatc3,1579030121.0,For sure. I am
phenibut,feeam9j,t1_fee6e98,1579029826.0,1.5g in the morning and 1.5g a few hours later
phenibut,feeakk1,t1_fee64r5,1579029798.0,Yeah for sure I had that thought. But just getting out of my comfort zone. Never tried bjj but I’ve thought about it
phenibut,fed7khb,t1_fed54ai,1579002561.0,It goes amazing with stims!! Shit is literally amazing
phenibut,fed4v1w,t1_fed4ll8,1578998958.0,"I take 1.5g to start then another 1.5g later in the day usually. Anything more and I get really tired. 

However since you’re just starting, you want to start with a low dosage. Maybe take 3 capsules, 900mg total to start. See how that works. If you don’t notice any positive effects, wait a couple days and take 4 or 5 capsules so 1.2-1.5g. You should definitely feel that. Don’t recommend anymore than 3g in a day. Also don’t eat anything 2 hours before you take it and 2 hours after you take it. 

Also, don’t take it everyday. 2x a week. Tolerance builds fast and you can get badly addicted to it and have bad rebound side effects. Luckily I’m able to use it a few days a week and have no issues but I’m one of the few lucky ones."
phenibut,fed4lk1,t1_fed32m9,1578998570.0,"Yes this is what I need to work on, the social interaction without the phenibut."
phenibut,fed4khi,t1_fed2bcm,1578998527.0,Yeah same anxiety messes me up
phenibut,fed4jlp,t1_fed47cq,1578998492.0,Extremely positive! Some people compare it to Xanax without the high but idk about that one. I’d probably compare it more to when I would drink when I was younger when I didn’t have much of a tolerance and alcohol made me extremely social and talkative - like 4 shots of vodka maybe
thesopranos,fed0ps2,t3_eohs2i,1578992844.0,AJ. Drove me nuts
probation,fed0nfg,t3_eofnjw,1578992752.0,48-60 hours and you’re clear. 80 hours is a myth.
malefashionadvice,fecpjd1,t3_eo6w0h,1578980034.0,"No idea how people go to Marshall’s and tj Max and those stores. I stopped in tj Max today and the quality is so poor. Tried on 5 different Ralph Lauren shirts, all horrible fitting and terrible quality. I know sometimes there’s a good find now and then but Everything I’ve bought in the past has broken down on me after a couple washes or shrunk and just looks terrible on me. The moment I started buying quality stuff from good brands online, my wardrobe and confidence dramatically improved. End of my rant haha"
