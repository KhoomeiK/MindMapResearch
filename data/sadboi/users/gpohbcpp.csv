I really thought I had it and the conversation/process was going good until the point where I said that we have to delete the notepad entry now and it was just like the digital equivalent of a hoarder on one of those shows. No matter how much of a compromise and consideration I made she just couldn't let go without having a kind of OCD anxiety at the last minute when it actually gets figuratively thrown in the dumpster.

If you read my edit oh, she really came around this morning and things are better."
