teenagers,f3w76xl,t1_f3w6ppx,1571193685.0,"It really does suck, but I guess thatâ€™s just part of being self aware. The bright side about this would be that thereâ€™s like 7 billion other self aware people out here and a significant amount can relate to you, so youâ€™re 100% not alone."
teenagers,f3w5s38,t3_diid00,1571192697.0,"I actually used to get these a lot, still do sometimes but Iâ€™ve learned to manage them a bit easier, theyâ€™re called intrusive thoughts. I would just have these random flashes of fucked up shit for no apparent reason other than just my mind wanting to fuck with me. It was horrible so you have my condolences. 

Basically, Iâ€™ll give you what I did but it also helps to look it up and inform yourself so you donâ€™t feel alone. In my case, it turned out being something called â€˜pure oâ€™ which is basically a purely obsessional form of ocd that takes random thoughts and puts too much attention on them. More than someone without ocd would. Now, Iâ€™m not saying you have ocd because people have intrusive thoughts all the time and itâ€™s not because of ocd in specifics. Iâ€™m only stating it cause it relates to my specific situation and how I got to managing it easier. 

So basically, something that really helped was putting it into perspective. People who get intrusive thoughts and put too much thought into that thought end up spiraling into the loop of negativity. If you end up somehow thinking of something messed up and then think about how messed up it is that you thought of something messed up youâ€™ll feel even more messed up.  Itâ€™s the unfortunate loop. So this is when you put it into a different perspective. 

It helped for me to think of these thoughts almost like a bully. The bully pops up and fucks with you, you react and give it the attention it wants, and it never leaves you alone. If you instead notice the bully is there, but choose not to react to it and just move on, the bully will get bored and leave you alone. It takes a bit of time depending on how much you let these thoughts get to you, but it really helps. Donâ€™t push these thoughts away, thatâ€™ll only bring them up more. Itâ€™s how the human brain is. Instead, you notice these thoughts, youâ€™re aware of their existence and yet their presence neither bothers you nor enlightens you, itâ€™s just another thought strolling by. Itâ€™s hard honestly, but itâ€™ll get easier to brush off as just another thought, eventually. 

Also, it really helps to remember that you arenâ€™t your thoughts. The human brain is so advanced and self aware that it just visits the brain equivalent of the wrong side of YouTube sometimes. Itâ€™s bound to happen and trust me itâ€™s nothing to get worked up over. That only inflames it. If you really feel like itâ€™s getting to you and itâ€™s hard to manage, donâ€™t hesitate to seek a therapist. They help a lot. Iâ€™m not a professional so Iâ€™m only sharing a way I got through it but no one person is the same so, just keep the therapist in mind because sometimes we just need that extra push. Hope I managed to give you a little clarity, good luck with it all."
