For example, the human population has varying ACE receptor sequences (SNPs) that can positively or negatively impact viral docking. Not sure how well the scientific community has characterized the factors driving the minimal symptoms in children for example. There's a lot of work that needs to be done and a lot of unknowns. Viruses are incredibly complex, efficient machines that change over time and the whole human cell machinery is involved in viral infection and reproduction, with many steps along the way that individuals can show quite varied responses to. I worked with someone that never developed a response to the HepB vaccine for example, and those individuals definitely exist in the population, though rare. That's why Hawaii asks for records of antibody responses to the rabies vaccine for dogs coming to Hawaii instead of just proof of vaccination."

askscience,fqy7b1e,t1_fqxcsle,1589743810.0,"As someone that has been developing therapeutic antibodies for the last 15 years, I can add one more piece of color to this: neutralizing vs non-neutralizing antibodies. Everyone with a competent immune system will develop antibodies to the virus, but the antibodies each person develops are different repertoires (types, numbers) dependent on their particular HLA haplotype and just random spatial and temporal chance. An individual develops antibodies to various viral proteins, and to various locations on those proteins, but they may or may not develop antibodies to the very specific location on the COV-2 spike protein where it docks onto the ACE receptor. Those particular antibodies that bind to and block the  receptor binding domain, RBD, are called neutralizing antibodies or antagonist antibodies. If an individual develops antagonizing antibodies they completely prevent the virus from ever infecting the cells for the duration of B cell memory (a separate question). If on the other hand, they develop anti-COV-2 antibodies that don't block the virus from entering the cells, the individual can have possibly a mild infection with some virus produced (maybe). The virus and any cells infected will still be recognized by the innate immune system (neutrophils, NK or cytolytic T cells expressing Fc receptors) and killed, but that response can be a little more delayed than immediate neutralization of the RBD. Not sure how delayed the cellular response is compared to just complete blocking. Lot of companies out there are trying to develop neutralizing antibodies to ameliorate the disease, Astrazeneca, Lilly, Regeneron, etc."
TwoXChromosomes,fqy0cfq,t3_glch8a,1589740564.0,"This may not get read, but here goes. Sometimes you HAVE to be (what you think is) the asshole, and that doesn't mean the relationship is going to end, even when for some people it might. I'm not talking about the truly abusive relationships, those have to end. We've been together 35 years since I was 20 and he was 28. We were emotionally clueless, emotionally damaged (me) and emotionally shut down (him), and sorry, anyone that age just is clueless, the brain doesn't even finish final maturing till 23-25 (Google human brain development age).

The one thing I wish I could go back and teach myself is to have the emotional maturity and perspective to not get backed down when I was told I was being too controlling (the word hubby used was  'harpy' in a moment of heat years ago) by anyone, not just hubby. We're two fairly average, mostly kind, lol, people. We can be assholes to each other. Give anyone 35 years and that will happen. It took me 25 years into the relationship to really be able to put my foot down and ask for my emotional needs without even a tiny nanosecond hint of AITA. Honestly, I think the thing that truly made me finally comfortable in my skin pushing people is managing a group of 7 at work. Don't have time for your bs please. The only solution I've ever come up with is to say yes to your daughters ideas and decisions as they're growing up. Teach them to be Kim fucking Kardishian confidence level 1000. Throw a little emotional awareness training in there so they learn to question their subconscious and avoid being true assholes.

I've dealt with my emotional damage over the last 35  years through meds, regular therapy, and emotional awareness workshops, couples workshops, etc. I'm at somewhere between 1500-2000 hours of that education. Dragged hubby kicking and screaming into therapy - ""I'm fine you're the broken one"" ... Bitch PLEASE! Still want to slap him upside the head for that one. Rant aside, I stayed the nagging course, dragged him through emotional awareness traIning (counseling) and 3 years ago he finally embraced the idea fully that he has a subconscious, at 60 ffs.

At the risk of sounding prejudgy, guys (really everyone, but guys in particular) respond to confidence. Don't ask, tell. If you tell them 'wash the dishes', and they throw some shade - look at them like their eyeball just rolled out of their socket and into their mouth and they started chewing on it... Sorry, stream of conciousness. Treat them like they're insane for arguing with you. And if it gets bad - MAKE THE GODAMNED TIME FOR COUNSELING (24 couples sessions and 24 individual each, not 1 or 2)

No I don't know why there's no BMP1 or BMP3, or the others. No there's no BMP10. But anyhoo, you see developmentally, in the womb, and then also in puberty, they were turned on longer for me than you because of my family genetics. You see my particular promoter driving BMP4 expression levels has a SNP in it that is associated with higher activity driving higher BMP4 expression and that drove greater osteoclast and osteoblast activity as my long bones developed. That SNP allowed for tighter polymerase binding to my BMP promoter driving greater transcription of mRNA levels, which as you of course know, leads to higher levels of BMP protein expression...
