Go on an online dating site, act like you don't give a shit (which you really shouldn't because you're letting society dictate how you feel about yourself) and just date a bit.

Your problem is you're scared of failure so you set impossibility high standards making it easier to reject women meaning you never fail because you never have to try.

I see a lot of me in what you write. The only way I managed to get laid around your age was to date someone i wasnt even that attracted to. You need to stop hating yourself for not meeting an imaginary deadline for relationships. Personally from what you've written you don't seem mature enough yet to be in one. You're nowhere near ready to be with a woman because you can't even be with yourself. Prove me wrong.

Edit: just checked your profile. You're not bad looking but you don't seem very well mentally. I really think you need therapy. You seem to be showing signs of depression."

This is what the right hate about the left - the moralising. They hate it because I think deep down they can't believe there are people out there who aren't as selfish as them. This is why the moment anyone on the left does something slightly bad the right jumps on it, but shakes off transgressions by someone from their ranks. The difference being for them that the people on the left ought to be practising what they preach whereas the entire thing of the right is that we're all selfish at heart.
