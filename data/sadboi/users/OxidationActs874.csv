The thing is that most people you meet in school never really know you the way you know yourself. 

Regarding your social anxiety, if someone negatively judges you based on your social ability not only is that a reflection of them, but their judgement is just an opinion, not a fact. In fact, I will tell you a secret. People are a lot more concerned about how they look than how others look. How many times have you been more concerned about how you look rather than how others around you look?

Please don't base your self esteem on what others think of you. What other people think of you is not a true reflection of yourself because they will never ever be in your shoes. As human beings, we are incredibly capable, after all that's how we survived as a race.

And there have been many attractive people who have been bullied. Regarding your first point, if someone treats, pays, and loves an attractive person more than you, that's a reflection of them and not you. There are also plenty of people that hate different ""attractive"" people for many reasons.

The flushing of the face is a evolutionary way we signal to other people that we're feeling uncomfortable with the immediate situation. Basically when adrenaline rushes to your face which dilates the blood vessels resulting in your skin blushing.

Some may notice it, some may not. Even if everyone in the whole room noticed it they will eventually forget about it. I guarantee you, everyone thinks much more about themselves than others. 

Think of the common fear of public speaking. Many people are scared of speaking in front of large crowds. But when you see someone get nervous while speaking, do you tease or mock them in your head? No! (I hope not). You think *Wow, he's nervous, I hope he does well.* 

When your skin flushes the next time try your utmost best to focus on something else in the room. It can literally be anything, a photo, a window, a whiteboard, some inanimate object will do. If I'm correct, this is called grounding. 

In the incredibly rare case that someone points out that your face is red, just laugh it off. Most people will then think that you don't think it's a big deal. 

If you start to become really worried about your skin flushing (like it's constantly on your mind), then visit your college's counseling center. They have people to help you."

ABCDesis,ewqgs5q,t3_cpn15v,1565665556.0,"I personally don't get annoyed when people accuse me of being ""whitewashed"" because people don't accuse me of being ""whitewashed"". I suspect I'll be able to move on from accusations like that quickly. **But** *I do understand your frustration*. Being desi is obviously a **big** part of our identity, and when someone accuses you of not being who you are, time and time again, it *can* becoming annoying.

And regarding the stereotype of South Asian women being meek and submissive, as much as its annoying you, *try to distance yourself from it*. **Break the stereotype** and show people that you are your own person. *You're not in this world to please anyone.*

grammar,ewqav8l,t1_ewqa1dl,1565661112.0,"For context: I'm a native English speaker (studied grammar obviously).
I haven't really heard of that rule. Usually when I'm reading books with dialogue, you denote who the speaker is after the quotations.
> ""Yeah, I know!"" he said.

But the rule can (and will) be broken to avoid repetition and prevent the reader from feeling 'bored':
>""Yeah I know!""

>""No you didn't know...""

>""Yes I did, and you're wrong!""

Here Person A talks first, then Person B , and finally Person A. Authors normally write these constructs in a logical sequence to prevent confusion. However, the intention *normally* (as stated above) is to prevent boredom."

This is because stylistically it just looks weird. I also haven't seen the comma being used like the example above."

Based on what I've read your brother seems to be considerably younger than you (maybe not), and since he's young he hasn't really fully learned how to behave courteously in front of others. Your parents shouldn't be enforcing this behavior especially when they know about your issues. I don't know what your parents are dealing with for them to act like this, but they are TA. Your parents should understand that everyone has their own wants and needs, especially their children."

It’s ok to be right wing and pro-Hindu. Just not too far on both sides. However, this subreddit is for a specific set of people, desis who grew up in western culture or grew up in the anglo sphere afaik. But people, who aren’t the intended audience for this sub, shouldn’t be coming here from other subreddits and mass-downvote comments and threads. They also shouldnt be mercilessly disrespectfully targeting genuine users of this sub. This is technically vote manipulation and harassment and against the reddit rules afaik. 

When users from other subs post links to this sub they should adhere to using no participation links."

As always entertaining the idea of changing the name is interesting."
