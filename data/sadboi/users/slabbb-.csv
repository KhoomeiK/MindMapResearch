Jung,fqwd52e,t1_fqwbe7d,1589700214.0,"Jung's concept of our innate potentially realisable wholeness, and an archetype.

>Self. 

>The archetype of wholeness and the regulating center of the psyche; a transpersonal power that transcends the ego.

>As an empirical concept, the self designates the whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole. But in so far as the total personality, on account of its unconscious component, can be only in part conscious, the concept of the self is, in part, only potentially empirical and is to that extent a postulate. In other words, it encompasses both the experienceable and the inexperienceable (or the not yet experienced). . . . It is a transcendental concept, for it presupposes the existence of unconscious factors on empirical grounds and thus characterizes an entity that can be described only in part.[""Definitions,"" CW 6, par. 789.]

>The self is not only the centre, but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of this totality, just as the ego is the centre of consciousness. [""Introduction,"" CW 12, par. 44.] 

>The self appears in dreams, myths, and fairytales in the figure of the ""supraordinate personality,"" such as a king, hero, prophet, saviour, etc., or in the form of a totality symbol, such as the circle, square, quadratura circuli, cross, etc. When it represents a complexio oppositorum, a union of opposites, it can also appear as a united duality, in the form, for instance, of tao as the interplay of yang and yin, or of the hostile brothers, or of the hero and his adversary (arch-enemy, dragon), Faust and Mephistopheles, etc. Empirically, therefore, the self appears as a play of light and shadow, although conceived as a totality and unity in which the opposites are united.[Definitions,"" CW 6, par. 790.]

>The realization of the self as an autonomous psychic factor is often stimulated by the irruption of unconscious contents over which the ego has no control. This can result in neurosis and a subsequent renewal of the personality, or in an inflated identification with the greater power.

>The ego cannot help discovering that the afflux of unconscious contents has vitalized the personality, enriched it and created a figure that somehow dwarfs the ego in scope and intensity. . . . Naturally, in these circumstances there is the greatest temptation simply to follow the power-instinct and to identify the ego with the self outright, in order to keep up the illusion of the ego's mastery. . . . [But] the self has a functional meaning only when it can act compensatorily to ego-consciousness. If the ego is dissolved in identification with the self, it gives rise to a sort of nebulous superman with a puffed-up ego.[On the Nature of the Psyche,"" CW 8, par. 430.]

>Experiences of the self possess a numinosity characteristic of religious revelations. Hence Jung believed there was no essential difference between the self as an experiential, psychological reality and the traditional concept of a supreme deity.

>It might equally be called the ""God within us.""[The Mana-Personality,"" CW 7, par. 399.

It varies though usually it bothers me to some extent. But its also relative; who's to say ones interpretation is right in a given instance? Subjectivity complicates or lenses much, unless perhaps supporting quotes clearly establish the parameters or definition of whatever it is under consideration. It depends on the specific instance and the particularities of what is being purveyed or misconstrued. However at present I rarely make a point of criticism or offering another take based on my own reading of Jung for a variety of reasons. Largely that is more about time and energy available to address the matter at hand, both of which I usually haven't got a lot of, though the situation is different now. Sometimes it's about sourcing of my own interpretation in Jung's actual words (also time and energy) or I'm not sure of my own understanding on a matter or haven't read the related material. At other times my response is one of irritation or annoyance in the sense it's more about my own stuff as a response, rather than a balanced assessment on whether some stated perspective being representative of Jung's position or psychology is accurate or not. 

There are many knowledgeable in the sub too, mods included, who can offer correctives or alternative points of view; it's a community effort in that sense, mutual learning. It's not my sole perogative.

Sometimes its about letting others wrestle with something themselves in terms of the ideas or get to a point where they're willing to engage the material on its own terms. It depends..

Sure the numbers increase dilution of some regions of quality or depth of post material, or thins the number of posts dealing with issues most pertinent to oneself, and there's other issues, such as tech and mobile platforms or delivery preferences that affect this also. But deep and useful material is still being contributed to the sub. It ebbs and flows. 

The sub can't replace therapy or individuation as it is lived and wrought, but it can still facilitate aid and touch points for learning in that process.

You could call it a social kind of synchronicity I guess, a coincidence of intensities, repressed, unresolved fear and cultural calamities long imagined and primed to a pitch; a kind of egregore drawn on to evoke unconsciously, the kind of response needed to generate mass social change? My understanding of Jung's concept spins more on a subjective, individualised coherence and vector of meaning; where is the individual lens located in the social-collective through whom the synchronicity occurs to or is triggered by? What is acuasality socially-collectively?
Certainly disaster of various kinds has been on the mediated minds' screenhorizon of late, hyperspectacularised, and the events unfolding mimic and echo that - was this a sync, or a reset, we were collectively looking for and set-up in some mass manner that eludes conventional analysis or assimilating? - while the ideas of a pandemic specifically nailing society has floated around fictional universes, media, predictive programming and warnings from science for decades, life imitates art en masse, and so on. There's a cacophony of narratives, meanings, responses, defenses, proscriptions, posturings arising, colliding, which is interesting in itself. 

>I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this the right way

What is the right way here? Everything is topsy turvy now, restricted, altered, unusual, as you note..

I've wondered if the collective unconscious is evolving in itself as a social-collective complex towards its own teleologically propelled self as an augmented collective consciousness? As in the ego-persona of the social and collective - however that could that be determined? - is assimilating its own shadow in some manner? Or, relatedly the inferior function of the social is being forced into use or development -  if a generalised typing of 'the social' and its function distribution as a kind of personality or operation as a social-complex ego can be mapped? 

Other images, symbols, that come to mind;
the Anima Mundi or Gaia bringing forth something out of itself towards stimulating, evoking, a return to balance through correction, a virus to tackle a virus, a kick back of kinds?

Thoughts of libidinal stoppages, arrests, reversals find echoes in conditions of a katabasis or Nekyia; having to undertake a journey into our own selves or into spaces of occupancy prolonged as if usually 'underground', compartmentalised into smaller and hidden or absent recesses in our busy every day usual normal. This can be likened to a kind of trial, something is endured in a process, there is an eventual end to it and some kind of transformation has taken place once the journey is completed. 

Elsewhere, the ouroboros finds loose correspondence to how you elaborate the opposites here; linked to the axiom of Maria, these opposites can become intrinsic to a generation of a third position in psychological space through stages and progressive process via the transcendent function. A kind of wholeness, an emergent 'one', unity generated and continuing to arise through pieces, indigestible aparts coming together & undergoing various transformations of state etc.. 

Other associations or more cosmic correspondences could likely be drawn and of those mentioned its all cursory, undeveloped."

>In an attempt to explain the psychological factors responsible for the horrors of Nazi Germany, it is argued that Europe produced Germany, that Germany was but the crystallizing point for social and spiritual upheavals permeating all of Europe, and that all of Europe shares Germany's guilt. Certain social conditions, e.g. mass unemployment, urbanization, and dependence on the state, are seen to have exacerbated the German predisposition to feelings of inferiority. This inferiority complex was manifested in overcompensation and in a whole nexus of pathological features that were flagrantly displayed in the person of Adolf Hitler. Hitler is described as the incarnation of the average German. The German people saw in Hitler the reflected image of their collective hysteria. By hysteria is meant that the opposites, inherent in every psyche, are further apart than normal, resulting in a higher energic tension and a disposition towards inner disharmonies. Goethe's Faust is cited as a perfect example of this side of the German nature. Germany's pact with the devil is said to lie in her abandonment of the spiritual for the material. With Nietzsche's proclamation that God is dead the projected psychic image of God returned to its origin and produced a feeling of ""God almightiness"" that led the German people to disaster. The moral problem facing Europe is defined as a need to discover new sanctions for goodness and justice now that they can no longer be found in the metaphysics of religion. It is concluded that Europe must understandand accept its collective guilt and learn to live with the dark shadow that has been uncovered in its collective psyche. 1 reference.

Jung,ffv5e5t,t3_ev0vnf,1580256076.0,"A difference can be discerned in their vocations as informing their orientation, thought and motivations perhaps; Jung a pyschiatrist and psychologist, a doctor with patients, while Corbin was a professor, trained philosopher, theologian and Islamic scholar. However, their field of phenomenological concern accessed via dream and altered states seems to overlap considerably and significantly, as if they've both entered and are traversing a similar if not the same terrain. Distinctions seem to lie in subtleties of interpretive meaning, theoretical assumptions and nomenclature.

Corbins work is rooted in a Persian Zoroastrian and Islamic metaphysics, mysticism and angeology, validating, exploring and developing a specific spirituality, a mysticism of the imagination, characterised in its morphology and map by the Eastern milieu his work was embedded in, while Jung's theories construct a sui generis  model of the psyche in relation to the depth psychological and medical model he initially was exposed to and worked out of (late 19th C- early 20th C., Bleuler, Freud), alongside experiential disclosure and psychotherapeutic work (Jung and his patients), amidst religious, alchemical, social, relational and scientific considerations in a Western context primarily (though with universal, transcultural ramifications).

Corbin, though his primary influence is Persian mysticism, adopts some of Jungs concepts but takes them somewhere else, elaborating his spirituality of imagination, describing and theorizing the ""imaginal"", an interzone esoteric dimension accessed via the faculty of imagination peopled with various transpersonal mythological and religious entities, much like realms of dream or what is witnessed in some forms of active imagination.  Without going into detail, there's a notable correspondence here with the Jungian unconscious, its phenomenology and the archetypes.

Each valued the creative imagination as a key faculty enabling access to the unconscious, here they meet, but Jung appears elusive, paradoxical or contradictory about metaphysical realities and implications depending on context, while Corbin accepts wholeheartedly a specific esoteric cosmology as ontologically real.

This isn't intended as exhaustive, there's likely finer points to be made and it was a while ago that I dove into Corbin; I've forgotten much. Like Jung its very complex, deep and rich material.

If you dont mind me asking, what's your interest in Corbin?"

Jung,ffgzg61,t1_ffdi7f9,1579919039.0,"Some curious and contradictory perspectives from Jung, in his lecture series on Kundalini yoga, speak to this topic:

>But in the *ajna* center the psyche gets wings—here you know you are nothing but psyche. And yet there is another psyche, a counterpart to your psychical reality, the non-ego reality, the thing that is not even to be called self, and you know that you are going to disappear into it. The ego disappears completely; the psychical is no longer a content in us, but we become contents of it. You see that this condition in which the white elephant has disappeared into the self is almost unimaginable. He is no longer perceptible even in his strength because he is no longer against you. You are absolutely identical with him. You are not even dreaming of doing anything other than what the force is demanding, and the force is
not demanding it since you are already doing it—since you are the force. And the force returns to the origin, God.

The Psychology of Kindalini Yoga, p. 57

>To speak about the lotus of the thousand petals above, the *sahasrara* center, is quite superfluous because that is merely a philosophical concept with no substance to us whatever; it is beyond any possible experience.
In *ajna* there is still the experience of the self that is apparently
different from the object, God. But in *sahasrara* one understands that it is not different, and so the next conclusion would be that there is no object, no God, nothing but brahman. There is no experience because it is one, it is without a second. It is dormant, it is not, and therefore it is *nirvana*. This is an entirely philosophical concept, a mere logical conclusion from the premises before. It is without practical value for us.

Ibid., p.57


>Mrs. Crowley: Do you think the idea is to experience those cakras,
which one has gone through, simultaneously?

>Dr. Jung: Certainly. As I told you, in our actual historical psychological development we have about reached *anahata* and from there we can experience *muludhara*, and all the subsequent centers of the past, by knowledge of records, and tradition, and also through our unconscious.
Suppose somebody reached the *ajna* center, the state of complete consciousness, not only self-consciousness. That would be an exceedingly extended consciousness which includes everything—energy itself—a consciousness which knows not only “That is Thou” but more than that—every tree, every stone, every breath of air, every rat’s tail—all that
is yourself; there is nothing that is not yourself. In such an extended consciousness all the cakras would be simultaneously experienced, because
it is the highest state of consciousness, and it would not be the highest if it did not include all the former experiences.

Jung,fb94rrl,t3_ebze7p,1576629343.0,"Further, re: the article itself, all too briefly:

A Red Book for UFOs, hmm, interesting. Maybe it already exists in variant forms on it as a theme? (thoughts of the artist David Huggins of [Love and Saucers](https://www.loveandsaucers.com/) fame, or Valdamar Valerian's acid-attack critique, analysis and manifesto-in-one, [Matrix III](https://www.google.com/search?q=valdamar+valerian+matrix+III&sxsrf=ACYBGNTEA6tvsvXtLHC1e8DpAqr20TTASQ:1576718126715&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwio-unexMDmAhXPxjgGHXaHC0sQ_AUoAXoECAwQAw) for example).

Though interesting to read I'd contend the author and the others he cites from in establishing his perspective have a mistaken view of Jung's definition and framing of archetypes themselves (though I cant really say without delving into it more deeply. I'm familiar with Wilber's model, not the others cited). How are archetypes 'flattened down' while posited as existing simultaneously as deeply rooted evolutionarily *and* transpersonally, embodied while autonomously existent and arising in a speculative metaphysical zone as if outside time & space? Afterall Jung does speak of a ""subtle body"" and the psychoid, the unus mundus and anima mundi read *and experience* as thoroughly trans and suprapersonal simultaneous to being 'grounded' and interfaced through as psyche, as psychological event. There's an aspect that remains numinous despite any psychological mapping going on through Jungs model, which arguably Jung accounts for, even if he draws a line in the proverbial sand in instances of the metaphysical variously. I'm not sure he really saw them as genetically inherited either, even though he links them biologically to instincts in some regions of his writing and elsewhere keeps a distinction..

There's more, lacunae and questions left hanging in how the author here is both interpreting and framing Jung. There's some good material, but the criticality is a little misleading, missing distillation, problematising the article and its purported mission of re-examining Jung."
Jung,fb8yhz8,t1_fb6ae5i,1576624866.0,"Some minor observations as contribution towards discussion:

To locate my comments, I'm not a Sufi nor am I Muslim, but i did receive some instruction under a Sufi ""master"", teaching under the auspices of a Shaykh for a period of time a few years ago I forget many of the technical details and terms now.

I've travelled a long path winding partly through Bahai which maps to similar metaphysical conceptions and esoteric cosmology as Sufism (albeit with key differences). That's how I arrived at this point in my journey and inquiry. It ended abruptly otherwise I'd still probably be in it.

The notion of a black dog - perhaps more readily associated with melancholia and depression in a Western context, though also the nigredo in alchemy comes to mind - wasn't really discussed specifically in terms of  symbolism in that situation, interesting to see it raised in the encyclopedia entry, but the inner jihad was present, conveyed as struggling with what is considered a 'lower' or animal part of oneself, [Nafs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafs), and its transmutation vis a vis methods and a heart oriented relation that maps to an esoteric alternative chakra system (horizontally arranged across ones chest in contrast to the vertical Indian subtle anatomy and diagrammatic). Conceptions such as Nafs and 'Shaytan' seem to correspond to some degree with shadow content in a Jungian sense, even though Nafs conceptually correlates to ego and persona primarily, so maybe more personal shadow and the complexes that constitute that rather than collective unconscious material (?). 

Initially there wasn't a lot of concern with any aescetic practice or instruction, establishing something via meditation technique was what was deemed most relevant. The technique engaged was part of what delivered an ameliorating affect on the content of the process at hand in terms of repentence, but there was more to it, prayer, philosophy etc.

However that's all fairly anecdotal, experiences via one school of Sufism, for not very long, and I'm a Westerner; my purview is limited in the terrain.

The models arguably can be oriented and viewed through conjunctively, depending on familiarity of concept and where presenting phenomena might sit in relation to those imo, but there's an inherent metaphysical persuasion and esoteric cosmology accepted in Sufism that is different from a Jungian model that needs to be taken into account, besides the religious framework its embedded in.

Generally there appears to be considerable points of overlap with Sufi psychology and Jung's model and methods, much more than I've mentioned here, though I've yet to come across any specific analysis and mapping of this in greater detail.

Edit: Additionally, interestingly, there's also the Dark Night of the Soul of Christian mysticism, which may or may not concern similar conditions to the black dog (?), and Henry Corbin's work elaborates on Sufi psychology in terms of mystical phenomenology vis a vis some regions of Jungian conception, i.e. active imagination, imagination vis a vis the imaginal, archetypes, among others."

Sometimes Jung emphasises what appears like static features of a constantly dynamic psyche through conceptual allocation and description but he didnt see it as fixed and non-moving, the psyche - conscious and unconscious - to Jung is always in movement even if there are structural features that appear to be constant and universal.

There's a strong both/and with Jungs model and thinking, its a [dual-aspect monist theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-aspect_theory); what is positioned in a static manner in a given instance, one sided, gives way eventually to its opposite or is already priorly entangled in its opposite simultaneously as another aspect of it without which the whole cannot be spoken to.

Relatedly, Jungs model maps to the neuroscientific conception of the unconscious in varying degrees (see post-Jungians John Ryan Haule, Erik Goodwyn, and Jean Knox for more detailed discussion of this), as Scott Jeffrey speaks to in his reply, in the sense that what is considered (the) unconscious is greater than egoic consciousness and behaviour, thought, feeling and embodiment is majoritively directed and initiated from these regions."

You dont need a belief in God to practice it, but if youre seeking God through it, it can find you through this way.

Its hard to say what you really need..there's a lot suggested and implied in your OP. And as others point out attitude is an issue; the beginning of search is often something of a divesting self from self to come to an end, getting to an end of self and world where a letting go occurs.

A 'rock bottom' is good, is useful, a space of potential and transformation. You sound like you are close, desperation bleeding through in your comments (no judgement, I'm well familiar with something similar).

A method may be part of it. Something that is practiced day-in, day-out over a long period of time. Yoga could meet this.

It's hard work. But when you engage a practice of such a nature something tends to happen. 

Yet, as others point out, you can't force God. And ones search can take a life time, if that's what it takes (see my other comment ITT with some material from a mystical way regarding the requisites of search).

An experience of God doesn't solve ones issues, problems of matter and/or mind, necessarily either. Particularly if trauma is involved.
