alcoholicsanonymous,fqjm572,t3_gj9xe1,1589411916.0,Thank you for this. Ive been told to go off my psych meds multiple times by fellow AA ers  like that's between me and my doctor and what you think of that is between you and your God. I know a lady who was so anti meds to the to the point where she shamed people for taking meds a newcomer instead of going off of his meds and a weekly or calling her and blowing his head off with her on the phone one really like I know this lady I've been in meetings with her she's a bully.

alcoholicsanonymous,famwnka,t3_e9wms4,1576215113.0,"It's not how often you drink, it's what happens when you do drink. Get to a meeting asap, go early and stay late, introduce yourself to women in the program who have some time and know what they're talking about. Get a sponsor and if you have the gift of desperation and are willing to go to any lengths to stay sober then follow your sponsors suggestions like they're the law.this program works for people who work it."
alcoholicsanonymous,f9j3bva,t3_e5a1bh,1575354442.0,My sponsor had me write out the responsibility pledge and the 3rd step prayer 50 times each because those are the ones I was having trouble remembering. Now I have my sponsee do the same.

He was my very best friend and losing him crushed my world. I felt like my tether to life was cut and i had no more place in this world. I survived two serious suicide attempts immediately after losing him. 4 years later im on a journey to healing but life still feels emptier without him."

AskReddit,f3omj36,t3_dhc7vw,1571021952.0,Does that gap in your tooth make you self conscious?
alcoholism,f35qa72,t3_dfock4,1570685980.0,"I personally need my psychiatrist for my trauma, medication for my moods and AA for my alcoholism. It sounds like all three could benefit you too. It's awesome you're realizing your problem so young. Don't go down the dark path of a low bottom drunk like me. It doesnt have to get any worse than it is. I've been sober almost 3 years and my life has changed drastically. Give yourself a chance

You never have to drink again if you don't want to and you never have to drink again even if you do want to."
