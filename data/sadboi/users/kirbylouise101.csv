Anxiety,fle1dgh,t3_fo6h6w,1585075751.0,Yes ! I've been struggling much the last few days. It is so much worse for me at night and I just feel like I can't breath properly as well.
cricut,fkp90l2,t3_fju7z1,1584404535.0,You've got this ! You've done it once before you can do it again. Just remember to stay as brave and strong as you did the first time !

Anxiety,fj7szka,t1_fj7ru3d,1583097642.0,I get the same thing in the back of my throat before a panic attack. That must have been really hard with the vomiting as well ! Can I ask do you have a way of managing the needing to pee? I've always tried waiting a little bit longer than I need to each time I have the urge.  Thank you for the reply.
