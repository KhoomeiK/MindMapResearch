I don't claim to be better than anyone, but I'd appreciate a level playing field when serious, career changing opportunities are in question. We have more than a billion people in India and when you do the effort to try to stand out of the crowd only to be dismissed by a person's bias, it hurts in more ways than one. Life is in no way fair but schools and colleges are the foundation of one's future, and so, I believe true equality in some aspects could promote the right kind of competition amongst students."

They think this bullshit rumour is true when there is absolutely no way Series X is coming in @ less than $500 considering Series S will come in @ $300-350 and One X will be available for $200(maybe). Also, xCloud serves a big role in pricing too. Microsoft knows that a big audience CAN pay a premium for the physical consoles say $300-500, and those who can't, have the option to play games through xCloud. I don't think Microsoft is motivated to release cheap consoles because xCloud has that area covered."

Also, if Rare's Everwild turns out to be a Sea of Thieves clone or something similar to that, I'll lose all respect for Rare. Everwild looks gorgeous but it's like they refuse to listen to us.

XboxSeriesX,fpz015e,t1_fpyroxh,1589011131.0,"I think Xbox lacks good narrative driven games. Hellblade 2 and hopefully exclusives from other studios will help clear that drought. 
Really excited to see Forza Horizon 5 on new hardware since Playground Games have always delivered A+ games. Anticipated to see how Halo turns out, too.
Personally, I've never been a fan of RPGs like Outer Worlds since it involves dedicating so much time to meagre tasks that it's much better to play an actual fun game. The fact that Xbox is investing so much in RPGs makes me worried for myself since I'll have nothing to play, really. But again, Xbox says they're making a ""diverse"" lineup of exclusives, so we'll see about that. Also, I hope Rare stops making exclusives like Sea of Thieves and does what classic Rare used to do, make amazing ""story focused + fun gameplay"" games. 
Basically, July will dictate if a person needs to invest in Xbox hardware and software, or not. 
What about you? What interests you the most about the future of Xbox?"
XboxSeriesX,fpypo0v,t1_fpymbm8,1589007610.0,"Anything can happen with Series X pricing. Microsoft is such a successful brand that they have the option to undercut Sony and bring in more people to Xbox and then recover the losses through games, accessories, services. But, 499 seems more likely because we got Series S coming soon which will most likely be 299 or 349. Microsoft does not want to confuse the customer by pricing both consoles very close so, 399 for Series X doesn't make sense. We have to factor in xCloud too as Microsoft now gives people who can't afford consoles an option to play console games, so obviously, the actual console hardware is targeted towards folks who can actually pay a good premium for a good gaming machine. 499 is realistic although 399 would be an amazing surprise."
