SkincareAddiction,fqa60cu,t1_fq8c00r,1589213436.0,"Omg, it has been an ordeal. I had to go to three different dentists and then a specialist because the tooth roots were in my sinus line and it was giving me severe sinus infections, which I had no idea it was the tooth doing it, but yeah it's a #3 molar where a filling came out then it cracked & got infected. The extraction was rough, it was like the tooth didn't want to come out even though it needed to, I'm on day 6 and still in some pain but it's getting better. Next comes getting an implant which should be super fun lol."

This image is all over Pinterest and Reverse Image Searching hasn't helped. I guess if no one can find them I am open to suggestions for a pair like these, as long as they aren't oversized. Any help is greatly appreciated. (Sorry for posting multiple times I didn't realize you can't post an image with text)"

Grimes,fj2eoy8,t1_fj1o9hs,1582941756.0,It looks like a reverse black smokey eye if that makes sense. I would tape off the edge like you were going to do winged liner and do what you were going to do on the eyelid underneath.
Anxiety,fg0ik1e,t3_ew89e2,1580408514.0,"Sounds like if you're 24 and living with parents (no shame, I'm 27 and moved back home because rent was too high and I'm saving to buy a home also my mom needs a lot of help) that getting a dog might not be financially feasible at the moment."

AskReddit,fenqvow,t3_eq0b8y,1579289516.0,"I was born left handed but was forced to write with my right hand, I think a lot of Catholic schools used to do this but I'm not Catholic my father, when he was around, was just a dickhead. So now I'm some type of ambidextrous where I can't write with my left hand but I seem to do everything else with my left hand. It's a strange predicament to be in. So yeah, I would say being forced to write with your right hand is something only lefties have ever had to deal with."

antiMLM,fc3k48o,t3_efwg57,1577391552.0,"I think it's funny how I see huns on here posting with Starbucks drinks talking about how their MLM revenue has them able to afford Starbucks all the time like that is the definition of success but when others drink it, it's an indicator that they are wasting money that these MLM huns should be entitled too for their scam. As if it's any of their business what other people do with their disposable income anyway. Hope that makes sense, just wanted to point that out."
Ebay,fc1swp0,t3_efl9ic,1577328685.0,"I have heard on here that some people have much better luck with the eBay customer service on facebook, that they are more likely to side with a seller who is obviously correct."

Ebay,f7qmmvy,t1_f7p31q0,1573966193.0,"Right that's the what I find astounding, as soon as you threaten another user your IP should be banned from eBay, considering the fact that addresses are commonly exchanged."
Ebay,f7ocpaj,t3_dx8xye,1573925240.0,"I had this happen with the last coat I sold. eBay was of no help when i called, I sent proof that there was no hole but they still wanted me to pay return shipping give a refund and get my items back with a huge hole in it. The buyer also threatened to punch me, eBay also did not care about that even upon telling them the police were involved  that i did not want someone who threatened me shipping me anything. The buyer ended up settling for a $5 refund to ""pay someone to get the hole sown"" 😆 I would say a modest partial refund is the least hassle but if you want to go a different route I have heard good things about the eBay Facebook group. I do not have a Facebook but the next time I deal with a crazy buyer I'll make one just to have them handle it. The agents on the phone are useless in my opinion."

AskReddit,euxdxpf,t1_euv2716,1564086429.0,"Years ago I had a roommate with a lot of health problems that had moved away from his family to get treatment here in Florida, he died in his sleep and I had to  call his wife of 30+ years and tell her he passed away. A couple of days later his friend texted his phone, so I texted back letting him know and he WOULD NOT believe me. Idk, maybe I should have called and told him but I didn't know his friend and thought it might be weird, but yeah I guess he used to have a ""tell him I'm dead"" joke with this friend when he didn't want to talk to him, so I had to convince this guy that his friend was really gone. It was terrible."

Ebay,etsk9ng,t3_cd7bvo,1563147829.0,"Please keep us posted on how this turns out. I personally would go with what randommojo said ""Sorry this has happened, I will have to file a police report for mail tampering which is a felony.  Police may have to contact you for your side of the story.  Once this is complete we can proceed”. Only I would say,""The police in your area **will** have to contact you for your side of the story.
