Codependency,fqxuk2y,t3_glgczb,1589738089.0,"I'm actually experiencing this this very second. I woke up and I was feeling okay, then my girlfriend called and we talked and I was okay. Then she decided that we were going to do something and I suddenly felt myself tumble into a state of dread. It's not that I'm not okay with what we're doing per-se, I'm just not okay with her deciding for me. 

So I'm going to talk to her about it when I get the chance. I'm going to tell her that I'm not saying this out of disrespect, but that I'd appreciate it if she could ask me in future. It can feel uncomfortable setting boundaries when you've lived your life without them, but setting boundaries is necessary for your own health and safety as a person. And I think that the more you set them, the more you feel comfortable expanding them until you're comfortable with who you are and what you want and don't want."

totalwar,fqgvpp9,t1_fqgunyj,1589358769.0,"It's not that I don't like it per-se, I just haven't enjoyed it anywhere as much as historical backgrounds. In all fairness, I didn't give it that much of a chance. I tend to think, if it doesn't grip me, it doesn't deserve to be gripped. But I do agree with you, that is what I want. Way less empire management, it's too much of a headache. I have no problem with others enjoying it, I just want an on and off switch for it.

I may give Warhammer another try though. They do have fantastic artwork, costumes and variety. I was originally going to download Medieval II again!! Aside from the slow responses to commands, I absolutely love that game."
raisedbynarcissists,fqgvb4r,t3_gik6yo,1589358364.0,"My dad does this too. He spends on me occasionally and has done since I was a child. But it is very insencere. When you're in the cloud of their manipulation, it can be guilt inducing just like you described. But when your reality and their attempt to control it conflict, and you see them for the manipulators that they are, you realise why they were buying you things in the first place.

It's not because they love you. It's because they want you to 'owe them' something. They're not giving because they love you. They're giving so that when you have a conflict, they can say 'I did X, Y, Z for you, you ungrateful shit'. It's a tactical move to assert themselves and control you, it's not out of sincerity or the love of giving.

One way of testing this is whether they bring it up.

When my dad shouts at me, he brings up all the things he's done for me and tries to make me feel guilty for being ungrateful. But he did these things just *so that* he can make me feel guilty for being ungrateful. My guilt would keep me loyal, obedient and subservient, so he maintains control.

When you love someone, what you do for them isn't something you hold over them or use to control them. It's not a transaction. It's a gift, it comes from your genuine love for them and what they are.

And the question that you can ask yourself, to see if your mum's love is genuine is, does she love you for who you actually are? Or does she love what you could be in her eyes?

My father loves talking about himself. He talks about himself like no other. And it can be really immersing to slide into his stories and believe the way he presents himself. But they're lies. As somebody else put it, it's like that person who plays a flute to hypnotise the snake. That's what it's like when a narcissist talks. So you do well to keep your distance. Keep it. Survive. And when the time finally comes, leave and don't look back. You deserve to be loved and respected for who you are. And I wholeheartedly believe that you can do it."
depression,fqb4iif,t1_fq9p00x,1589230442.0,"It is incredibly disrespectful and out of context. By that logic nobody could or should complain about anything, because there's always someone that has it worse. 

Depression is a problem that requires a solution. 

The parents' ""brush it under the carpet"" treatment of the OP's problem stems from their not knowing how to handle their own problems. So they're advising their child to do what they do, ignore it. 

If you don't find the help you need from your parents, please do not be dissuaded from seeking it elsewhere. Your pain is valid, it deserves attention and respect and you're doing nothing wrong by bringing it into the light."
depression,fqb36ja,t3_ghmf37,1589229776.0,"I agree that oversimplification of depression is absurd and insensitive and ignorant. 

But the part about it naturally coming to you, I disagree with. Because the very nature of depression is that it *naturally* makes you feel hopeless. So you wouldn't naturally feel joyful or motivated or positive.

I do think that it's pointless if not harmful to force yourself to try to be all these things. Because that's just trying to plaster an open wound. What it needs is treatment. And by way of treatment, one *naturally* comes to feel all the good things without having to force anything."
depression,fqae283,t3_ghdi7l,1589217491.0,"What really fuels depression is hopelessness. So of course, it is unbelievable that you can live without it, or be cured of it. Especially if you've been depressed for a long time."
me_irl,fq1p9fh,t1_fq0gq8m,1589047723.0,"For the same reason that people find genitals attractive. I don't know what causes this, but that's the attraction that I feel to them. It's intense, fascinating and just very 'in your face'. They have that quality to make you forget everything in the room, they capture your attention. That's what it's like for me. One of my earliest childhood memories, when I was about 4, was looking at some lady's feet in a party I was at with my mum. I'd never seen anything so attractive, I didn't want to look away. I actually wonder whether seeing feet so young awakened my sexuality way too early. There are definitely some memories that I try not to think about. 

I've taught myself to look away from people's feet in inappropriate situations. Because to me, the average person wearing flip-flops feels like somebody just having their penis or vagina hanging out. It can be very distracting and uncomfortable trying to avoid staring at them. But you gotta do what you gotta do."
gatekeeping,fpbmbq0,t3_gc44ar,1588473337.0,A boxer and an mma fighter consent to fighting. It's their profession and they do it in a set time and place with rules and protection. That's not the same thing as being sexually assaulted against your will.
selflove,fpbas7r,t3_gcgh9e,1588465806.0,"I went through the same thing when the pandemic first started. I read one book and then I couldn't bring myself to get into another. I also berate myself sometimes for not doing more. 

But the truth is I have some underlying issues. I've been depressed since I was a teenager and I have anger problems too. So I'm starting to take steps to deal with that. I'm opening up more with my girlfriend. Today we filled out some anger management worksheets. I like to think that this time next year I'll be in a much healthier place mentally. 

Because the opportunity to do amazing things with life have always been here, covid or not. I've just felt incapitated in my engagement with it for a long time, and I'm finally starting to deal with why, rather than just pressuring myself to continue regardless of it.

I think it would be better for you to deal with the causes of your fear and anxiety than to just push yourself to be more productive. In the long run, you'll probably be more productive than if you just try to push onwards.

I hope that helps, and sorry if I've misunderstood anything you've said :)"
