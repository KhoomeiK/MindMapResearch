In fact, I'd been there close to two years and she'd never even said hello to me. She also had a weird drama vibe--she was unpredictable and aggressive. 

One day, out of the blue, I got home from work and had an email from a company that was looking for a freelance writer. The pay sucked and I didn't have time, so I ignored it.

 A few weeks later, things got really ugly at my day job and I saw the writing on the wall that my job was in danger. I figured it was smart to keep the door open for freelance work in case I got fired, so I responded to the email. I told the hiring manager that I wasn't interested at that moment because I worked too many hours, but that I was actively looking for a new job and would keep it in mind if things settled down. 

The timing was perfect. I got a call 24 hours later. The man who is now my boss said: I don't know if this would even interest you, but we have a position that is fully remote and that will take you about 2 weeks a month to complete. The pay was only $5k less than what I was making working FT.

 I was a little nervous to take a pay cut, but I have never looked back. I actually love my job now. It's totally task based. I do my work when and how I want.
