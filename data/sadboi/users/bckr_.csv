For a couple of simple tricks, when I was freaked out about Choronzon, I did the following:

1 - Say his name backwards, as a mantra. 

2 - Read the bit from Liber 418 again and realize he ain't so scary. 

The fear of him for me came from mixing that scene with the crossing of the abyss bit from Wake World, with my own psychedelic follies. Pick it apart, it's not real; it's within Your control.

3 - You've got a bit of chaballa wrong. The dweller on the threshold is lower on the tree than the abyss. You're thinking of the dweller in the abyss.

thelema,flxsjpm,t3_frchhs,1585589012.0,"Stirring feelings are totally normal. I wouldn't think too hard about them, but they can feel cool. Maybe when you get really deep into the practice and are working with chakras etc they might be more consistent, but for now I recommend just recognizing that there's energy moving around in response to what you're doing.

As others have said, don't worry too much about messing up the words. Certainly practice and memorize more so that you can be more confident and enjoy it more.

I've been performing Liber Resh 3-4 times a day for about 3 years now. Sometimes all I do is make some signs in my mind while turning my attention toward the sun. Sometimes I'll perform the thing out loud, vibrating the names, and then reciting Crowley's translation of the Stele of Revealing, which is a Thelemic culture thing (not sure who started it). Here are the results of my general practice, which Liber Resh is the foundation of:

* Greatly improved confidence & self-image; on a personal / interpersonal level but also at a cosmic ""There is no part of me that is not of the gods"" level -- diminished fear of the unknown, diminished fear of the spiritual world, diminished fear in my daily life
* I have a regular, daily method for returning to emotional / energetic equilibrium, or also expanding good and positive moods
* I have a personal connection with Thelema; Crowley says the point of this practice is to connect with the ""center of our system"", meaning not so much the center of the Thelemic system as well as the center of the Solar system -- both are the case for me.
* My pentagram ritual and my meditation practice are months if not years stagnant. . . but this little practice and regular attendance of the Gnostic Mass, plus a bit of sigil / sex magick have been enough to infuse my life with meaning & religion.

I'll share a tidbit I got at the beginning of my Resh practice. My now ex-girlfriend and I were screwing around at some beach, and leaving about the time the sun was setting. I'd just started performing Resh within the last few weeks, and I performed it in my head.

As I finished, the music from one of our smartphones started to glitch out. The stereo then said ""Continue. . . Continue. . . Continue. . . "", before returning to the music.

So I've continued.
