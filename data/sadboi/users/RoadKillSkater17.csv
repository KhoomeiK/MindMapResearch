On top of that she never even had any good or meaningful lines. Also when Poussey died, she was all up in arms and was like ‘no one can grieve as much as I can’ because they shared the same bunk. Other than that, I never really saw them have much conversation, it was always P and Taystee, or P and Crazy, or P and a Brook.

Not worth it the next time. If she doesn’t, let her know that it’s no longer hers to get, and blacklist her. Try to resell, depending on how specific it is, just to see if you could get some more money out of it. If you can’t, then I suppose destroy it. From now on though, do a 50% deposit fee. People will be more likely to pay the rest, and if not, you have a hassle fee. Also get everything saved.
