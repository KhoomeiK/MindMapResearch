If you don’t have ADHD, the Ritalin may have heightened effects, causing anxiety and exacerbating any mood swings you may tend to have. 

If you really need to take it, if it’s instant release, cut one in half and drink plenty of water and make sure to eat and don’t take it past 4:00 in the afternoon. Otherwise, I’d highly suggest just buying a couple energy drinks and then do what you gotta do, if you take stimulants that aren’t prescribed to you solely due to a disorder that may need them — I don’t suggest starting, because it’s likely you may develop a dependency

AskWomen,eyfes98,t3_cwtp49,1567047695.0,"When I was 15, this old man, might I add we were in a Starbucks, approached me asking me if I had a boyfriend and if not, he could be my boyfriend.  I told him I was 15 and then he replied with, “well you are rather too developed and beautiful to be only 15” and continued to bother me 

When I was 14, I had actually been targeted by a 21 year old. While there were no physical exchanges, we talked a lot and he was interested in me sexually and manipulated me a lot emotionally and I didn’t realize how wrong that was until just recently. 

This past year, we had a substitute who’s older maybe in his 70s and one day decided it was okay to comment on the appearance of my body and saying how “nice” it was and asked if I played any sports."
juul,eyeucu6,t3_cwbtfn,1567039137.0,"I think it’s strictly related to vaping from THC pods or CBD pods. People may not necessarily know where these pods come from, thus, may be inhaling toxic chemicals without knowing it resulting in fatal consequences. 

The media loves to sensationalize things and cause mass panic. I know a ton of people who have been vaping and using juul for a longer time than most of these people who have died allegedly by these tobacco products and are for the most part pretty healthy. While it does pose health risks, I’d think that one is more likely to develop cardiac related issues sooner from e-cigarettes than lung issues that would result in medical attention. Once you quit vaping, I’m no medical expert, but I believe the lungs begin to clean themselves out by producing mucus. I’d be more concerned about the impacts on lung failure from cigarettes than e-cigarettes. These people may have also just had been allergic or has already had pre-existing respiratory issues such as asthma and what not. We’ll never really know the full story, but it’s good to stay on the safe side. 

If you can quit, by all means, go for it before you begin to develop complications later in life. While they don’t cause accelerated issues like cigarettes do, over time, the chemicals are going to have a lasting affect on your body and lungs but I would think this would take years if you were already perfectly healthy to begin with. While they don’t cause black tar to form in the lungs, they do have the potential to pose health risks we may not know about yet since vaping is still relatively new and there’s not a whole lot of research surrounding the chemicals we are exposing ourselves to. 

I wouldn’t worry about it too much unless you are having problems that cause immediate concern like difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing fits, chest pain, etc. in that case I’d quit immediately and check it out with the doctor unless your symptoms require emergency medical attention"
backpain,eyeql2z,t1_eydyx69,1567037572.0,"No judgement! Good question. I need to play tennis considering it’s part of my athletic credit for school and tryouts are this week and next, so I can’t really be missing those. Aside from my obligations, the pain comes and goes. Like yesterday it was really bad but we didn’t have practice because it rained here so I got a day off and did some stretches that seemed to help while also sleeping in a different position. I woke up to it still hurting but after doing more stretches, the back pain seemed to fade away or at least I didn’t notice it as much when I went to practice, although, I wasn’t exaggerating how bad it was yesterday. 

Additionally, while of course complaining without a sense of action is completely useless, while a rolling backpack would be better for my back overall, it’s high school, and lets be honest here, people are jerks and like to kick them when walking in the halls/make fun of you because it seems silly. While that comes off as I care what people think of me, and to a certain extent just as most confused teenagers do, it’s just my preference. I’m trying to see if there are ways I can leave certain binders or journals in my teachers classroom throughout the day and stop by to take it home with me if I need to use it to study or do homework just so I’m not carrying as heavy as a load, or else empty out any papers I don’t need to be carrying on me throughout the day

Stims,ey76dqn,t3_cvxi5v,1566873076.0,"If you can, I’d suggest getting prescribed a beta blocker. They lower your heart rate and blood pressure (I’m prescribed it for my anxiety, but it’s used to treat high blood pressure I just take it as needed). Doesn’t make you feel weird unless your blood pressure is already low, it’s non-addictive and it works wonders for anxiety at least personally :) 

My blood pressure when I was anxious would rise to like 145/90 or something like that but once I took the inderal even if I was feeling anxious, it was 128/90 or something like that. 

To keep your heart healthy, stay away from stims and if you do need a pick me up, drink an energy drink or coffee as long as you’re not having other complications. Get at least 40 minutes of exercise 3-5 times a week (even going on a walk counts) and eat a well-balanced diet. Bananas are good for your heart 

Hope this helps. I’d suggest visiting your doctor and have them take a look to make sure there’s nothing more serious going on, but as long as you adapt a healthy lifestyle and especially if you’re young and not overweight/underweight you should be fine"

Especially if you have intrusive thoughts and feel the need to do specific rituals to counter-act those intrusive thoughts.

I take the SAT tomorrow and there was a type of bug I can’t even say the name of without panicking. I saw it in my room, got rid of it, and now I’m sleeping downstairs on the couch unable to fall asleep because of that experience. 

I’ll be honest, I should follow my own advice, but see if the next time this happens, try breathing in and out really deeply to calm yourself down a little bit. Then approach the bug and catch it and toss it outside or kill it, whatever helps you feel best. Then move to a different location that’s most comfortable for you until you feel comfortable returning. 

Also, for me it’s more of a compulsive behavior, but vacuuming,  washing your sheets and keeping an open space helps me. It comforts me  in knowing that it’s clean + also allows me to re-familiarize myself in my own space, knowing there’s nothing there if that makes sense

People without ADHD who take stimulants will react differently since their brain chemistry that allows them to focus is already stable, so the medication can cause all types of chemical reactions in the brain, producing a feeling/reaction similar to trying cocaine, for instance, which could possibly affect their ability to focus if they’re too hyper or if they’re tweaking a lot lol"

Anxiety,etn4a8v,t3_ccgk79,1562976327.0,"You’re not alone, I think you could call me the queen of health anxiety. 

Over this past year alone, I’ve had like 8 ER visits convinced I was having a heart attack or stroke, only to be told I’ve been experiencing panic attacks. 

The first thing when it comes to anxiety is to know that one of the major things anxiety does is create illusions in our mind. It blows things way out of proportion, and we need to be able to learn how to actively rationalize those irrational thoughts, which of course, can be difficult but is possible. 

Another thing about health anxiety specifically, is that when we become worried about a certain symptom or physical sensation, anxiety tends to heighten our sensations as we become hyper-aroused. So most likely, the symptoms you’re experiencing only feel strong because your anxiety is causing them to feel strong as it’s heightening your senses, making you want to focus on them more. It’s always good to still seek medical attention, especially if you feel as if it’s an emergency, but also know when to rationalize. 

Anxiety can also manifest itself in really, really weird ways. It’s not always just anxious thoughts and a racing heart. Other common symptoms can include abdominal pain (especially if you’re feeling stressed), nausea, headaches, dizziness, chest pain, numbness & tingling, chills, shaking, vomiting, etc. it’s possible that your abdominal pain may be a result of high or intense levels of anxiety or stress. 

It’s important that you are taking good care of yourself. Not only does that include eating enough and drinking enough water, but getting exercise (even if it’s just a walk in the park, it can go a long way regarding health benefits), getting enough sleep, and also, practicing self-care. It’s up to you how you want to practice self-care, as long as it makes you feel good and relieves some of that stress and anxiety you’ve been carrying. 

I’d suggest getting into yoga or practicing certain stretches and breathing exercises to become familiar with your body, that way it doesn’t feel as foreign or scary to you. 

I’d also suggest seeking professional help (I see a therapist) or at least confiding in a trusted friend or family member/mentor. 

I find that when I try to use my coping skills and divert my attention away from my symptoms, they usually go away on their own. If they continue to persist, then there may be something else going on 

Just know that everything will be okay, and if something is wrong, it’s always good to catch it early so you can treat it. The professionals know what they’re doing, and you know your body better than anyone else, so remember to listen to its needs and take care of it <3 hope this helped"

TrueOffMyChest,et1j65w,t3_c9nx8t,1562398207.0,"Idk, I think body positivity and posting your body on social media can be empowering and boost confidence, and if that’s what makes them happy or if it empowers them or does any sort of benefit, then so be it. 

At the same time, however, I do agree that girls may also be doing this for the likes and to seek validation from others because it may fuel their confidence. It’s a cultural thing really — and most of that influence comes from social media influencers who are doing the same thing. It gets attention, doesn’t it? I think there’s a void in a lot of people and we all have our own ways of trying to fill that void. 

It’s their decision, however. They may be objectifying themselves, but keep in mind that this behavior comes from a culture that is being promoted to objectify and sexualize women in the first place and some of these women may feel the pressure or need to conform to those expectations or standards to feel important or desirable. We can’t speak for all women though, and for the most part, social media (especially Instagram) isn’t supposed to be authentic, it’s where people go to post the best version of themselves and their lives anyways. Social media will always be toxic. 

That’s my spiel, take it or leave it"
StopSpeeding,esw0isv,t3_c9bs5y,1562307288.0,"I understand. Half the battle though is acknowledging you have a problem and asking for help, so congratulations on at least getting there! I’ve been in the same boat as you as I’m prescribed 10mg taken up to 3x daily as needed for my ADHD. 

For awhile, I was taking it as prescribed but then I started to take it more when I’d have loads to do and knew it would be a long night or something like that. And then I began using it more and more when I wasn’t supposed to be and also running out of my prescriptions early. Of course, I’ve never really opened up about it because I know the guilt and shame it can bring, but it’s perfectly okay if you happened to get yourself there. 

I think part of what got me hooked was just the feeling of wow! I can finally feel normal. I was so happy that I could get things done on time for once and actually have an interest in working harder and I just liked the motivation it gave me. I think one of the ways we need to look at addiction is why we get addicted in the first place, and that’s our answer on how we should approach the problem. 

So for you, it sounds like it’s a social thing. I can empathize where you’re coming from, but as you said, you can’t continue to keep abusing the drug. Regardless of how good it can feel just being on it sometimes, you need to be able to find ways to socialize without having to take it. I think seeing a therapist could help you a lot or maybe even going to a support group, i do the same and it helps me at least. I’ve learned skills and techniques that help me with specific problems I have that I used Ritalin for sometimes to solve them, but now I don’t have to anymore and just take it when I need to. 

Sometimes if I find myself tempted or getting out of control with it again, I’ll take a break from it, and take some time to do things completely sober unless I absolutely need it to focus or something and it helps me realize I don’t need this to do the other things I want to do or enjoy doing. Sure, it enhances things, but I also weigh the consequences and realize at the end of the day, it’ll still be there when I need it and there are other things I can do to help me. 

It took me a long time to get here and I still struggle every now and then, so it’s a lengthy journey (different for everyone though) but you are fully capable of getting there if I am. Good luck and I hope this helped"
Debate,esvzbvk,t3_c9bteb,1562306667.0,"On the military aid topic, 
your neg looks good but I think you could put it to better use as a counterplan + disad’s. So in matters of negating, you first talk about how currently the U.S, provides aid for African countries (I think I read that right, correct me if I’m wrong) and then onto how it affects terrorist organizations and a threat to national security so then you could state that the plan is the U.S. ought to provide military aid only to _____ authoritarian regimes and then go onto explain why it’s important we continue assisting those specific nations 

Your aff could use some more work though. You discuss quality of life, but it’s easy for someone to come right up and discuss the subjectivity and how you can’t really dictate/determine what quality of life means to a whole nation. Like you need stronger arguments or reasons instead of saying “we need to do x because it will make y’s quality of life better and that is good,” like so what? You know? You need more impacts there 

About your framework too, instead of saying “quality of life” as your value and “assistance” or something else like that as a standard or criterion, place more broad concepts as your value such as “morality” and then as for your criterion/standard, you could use “maximizing expected well being” or “improving quality of life”, because in debate, we debate things based off of how beneficial/efficient/moral they will be, and so you wanna be focusing more on how you’re achieving this idea of morality if that makes sense 

On the public health topic, 
You need more analysis and impacts in the case. Like sure these things are important like helping people and lowering incarceration rates, but WHY? 
And what are you doing specifically in the case to improve quality of life? How does the aff/neg do that? And then go more into detail 

Sorry if this was heavy or long or didn’t make much sense I was tired but I hope this was good advice and congrats on making QF! Sounds like you’re headed in the right direction. I really suggest going to debate camp over this summer or next summer if you can, it helps a ton and is so worth the time. Good luck!!"
AskReddit,esvwl4d,t3_c95wvl,1562305300.0,"This is me personally, this may not be for all girls, but first is height. I don’t care about height. My boyfriend is one inch taller than me and he’s 5’4 and I’ve never been more sexually attracted to anyone. Seriously, it’s all about composure and personality. 

And overall, expressing your emotions!!! Be cheesy, be clingy, be open about your feelings, don’t hold back tears, be affectionate, be passionate, be yourself and don’t feel like you have to repress any of that! Showing soft sides does not make anyone less manly (in my opinion at least) and is actually quite attractive"
Drugs,esvw1yk,t3_c9874l,1562305059.0,"Tbh, I have the same mentality. And it can become super toxic, I’ve fallen into some scary places because of it. 

Idk. I still struggle with that exact mentality and I know this is harder in context than it sounds but you kinda just have to get used to doing all of those things without using drugs, and then once you’re ready or you feel like you can trust yourself, maintain enough self control to be able to use them responsibly but not to the point where you feel like you need them just as much as you need water, yanno? 

Good luck. You have it in you, it can’t hurt to try at least yanno"
confessions,esvrskx,t3_c93egn,1562303220.0,"I’m so sorry. Even reading this, I felt slightly traumatized in the moment. I cannot imagine how it was for you and your family. 

This case particularly interests me because just solely due to the fact that he started showing the signs at such a young age, and even you said you did your best to raise him right with affection and care. The fact that he never responded to treatment implies some sort of personality disorder — antisocial maybe? Definitely psychopathic, but the thing with even personality disorders is that most of them develop due to trauma they face at young ages. This sounds clinical."
AmItheAsshole,esvpa2r,t3_c9978l,1562302217.0,"You’re not the asshole. She needs to handle her insecurities before getting into a relationship in the first place,

Good, healthy relationships are based off of trust. If the two of you can’t trust each other or give each other space, then you guys just aren’t good for each other. She shouldn’t be able to dictate what medications you’re on because that’s your business."
OCD,esd912e,t3_c6zygw,1561850509.0,"Do you see a therapist for this? If not, I highly suggest you should because mine helps me (personally) with my OCD tendencies and I’ve gotten better at correcting my rituals and thought patterns. 

Just know you’re not a creep or a bad person. Something to keep in mind though (and this is completely rhetorical) is to consider your past and how that might affect your thought process regarding this obsessive fear. If you have a history of abuse, it may be projecting itself now into your OCD and fueling it

Best of wishes though <3 !"

depression,epzds4q,t3_bwfp9o,1559663663.0,"No it makes complete sense. Coming someone who suffers from depression (although I’m on mood stabalizers), I know how hard it is to try and do things that actively help. And sometimes you do them and they don’t help. 

That’s the killer about depression — it’s a shitty state to be in but it also sucks out all the energy to get yourself out. It takes time, but after awhile, I’ve managed to found different techniques that don’t drain all of my energy or require little energy to do that helps me but everyone’s different & copes with it in different ways. I suppose do what you need to do as long as it’s not self destructive, but either way, regardless of always having that capability to “try harder,” the whole thing with depression is that that’s the issue. We can’t try harder because it’s 10x more difficult for us to try in the first place. 

So no, it’s not necessarily a choice. There’s always the choice to get up and do something, but with that comes that energy you’re forced to muster up"
depression,epy4gr5,t3_bwfp9o,1559619097.0,"I think that people have begun to push this mentality that happiness is the ultimate, default mood or state of being, and if you’re not happy, then there’s something wrong with you. 

However, we can all see where this can be extremely toxic and be untrue. The truth is, we naturally over analyze things. Sometimes emotions are just emotions — happiness, sadness, anger, etc. they’re natural. They’re NATURAL human reactions to certain events or thoughts or situations. Emotions are good to have. 

However, when we act in toxic or self-destructive or abusive ways, then that’s where your question can apply. It’s easier to resort to isolation or drug use or yelling at other people or other toxic behaviors during complex emotional periods. But feeling sad independently isn’t wrong. And for those who struggle with depression and other disorders that affect their mood due to a chemical imbalance or something else, it’s an illness. It’s not a choice. Some people are more genetically prone to developing cancer, and others may smoke for years and develop cancer that way. But it’s not that they chose to develop cancer either way. It’s similar in this situation. I don’t think anybody necessarily, mostly, chooses to be or become depressed, rather their choice lies in the actions they take on how they deal with their emotions and cope. 

And sometimes, people do want to be sad. Some people see a beauty in the melancholy, but at the end of the day, it’s up to us individually how we act in regards to how we are doing and feeling. Idk if I made any sense I’m tired but yea that’s my take"
