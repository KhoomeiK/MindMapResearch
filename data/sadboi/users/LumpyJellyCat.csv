SilverSmith,eu5lpmv,t3_ceryil,1563480207.0,"I’m assuming HS is the makers mark. 375 is 9k gold. The anchor means it was hallmarked in the Birmingham, England, assay office. The bottom 375 with the scales is the international convention hallmark. I’m unsure of the one in the middle but I think it’s the millennium hallmark, meaning it was made in 2000! Hope this helps."

drawing,erta8hv,t3_c3rlyg,1561236748.0,"Your perspective and creation of shape is wonderful. Be a little careful with your detail, as it can become difficult to read sometimes. Did you use a pen for this? Get yourself a set of drawing pencils and experiment with your depth of shading, adding different tones :) I can’t wait to see more of the artwork your produce. Definitely an artist right here."
