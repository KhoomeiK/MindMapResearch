idk why cancers get the reputation for being super faithful and committed idk. Don't wanna let my two bad eggs soil them all but I'm pretty biased now. They both reminded me sooo much of one another.

A particular scorpio just wanted to watch my relationship burn every time I seemed happy without him. It was all manipulation games.

Turns out they had history of sleeping together and still were, and he was actively seeking it out. She was a cancer Leo cusp too, birthday so close to him and had a boyfriend! Just amazing.

Did you find that they fibbed a lot when you confronted or when it benefitted them?? Always victimized themselves? I always own up to my shit and mistakes and it was eventually weaponized against me:/ I ended up blaming myself for a lot of our arguments in the end, often trying to appease them cause it was just impossible.

Something else the recent cancer did was like he would almost like try to spend his 'last dollar' on me when he didn't need to. He would offer and then be complaining and miserable that he was broke. Stopped accepting money, sometimes even food from him as a result of this. He often did this while in fights. Manipulative cop out, I guess."
