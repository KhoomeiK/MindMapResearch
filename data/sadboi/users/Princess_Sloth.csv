While your son is no longer dating Maggie, and though your wife is not interested in continuing a relationship with her, you still can. I hope that your son and his girlfriend can prove that their new relationship will be strong, in spite of the insensitive and damaging way they began it. I hope your wife and son can respect that you still consider Maggie family and want to remain in contact with her. I hope they can understand that. This is definitely a conversation that you must have with them."

I was 1 of 40 people they were considering and my interview lasted 3 hours. When it came down to me and one other person, we were given art tests where we had to come up with concepts- one school mural and another for Cirque Du Soleil.

AskReddit,fk79y7z,t3_fgwck0,1583931697.0,"My boyfriend and I went to an introduction to meditation a few weeks ago- which I was interested in because meditation has never really worked for me.

The instructor was really good about explaining the uses, what it was for, etc. and then getting our group into a meditation exercize. I was happy to realize that it seemed to be working for me during this session. It probably would have been even *more* successful experience were it not for this guy in front of me, doing obnoxiously loud vocalizations as he exhaled- sometimes they devolved into something like groans and laughter and Tibetan throat singing.

I assumed that was something this dude picked up from other meditations he had learned, but it was distracting enough that my boyfriend and I shot looks at each other like, ""Is this guy seriously doing this?""

The worst part is that he would do this while our meditation guide would try to explain stuff to us... And our guide even had to say, without pointing out this guy specifically ""Please quiet down so that everyone can enjoy the meditation."" And he KEPT FUCKING DOING IT.

At some point, I noticed that he would occasionally turn and interact with the girl to my left, who I assume came with him to this thing. I realized that this was his awful way of trying to impress her. Like a mating call from hell."
