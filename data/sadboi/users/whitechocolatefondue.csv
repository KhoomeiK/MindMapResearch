Awkward. Then they wanted to organize an event simply to come together on the streets and clap together like the brainwashed stupid pieces of shit they are. That never happened for obvious reasons. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel no empathy if any of those died from the COVID.

AskReddit,fo4gdp4,t3_fywl87,1587503929.0,"Probably the person who tried to kidnap me and molested me when I was a first grader (6 at the time). I was on my way to my godparents from school as usual and my parents would come get me after work when a stranger calls for me from his car in broad daylight right next to the house of my other godfather and across from the kindergarten. The street was a dead end. He told me he‚Äôs lost and he needs my help with the map. Being the kid who always thought the best of people I went and started walking towards his car.  I reach the front and he steps out the car exposing himself to me. The bastard mustn‚Äôt have been a genius, because he tried to grasp after my wrist with his trousers down to the ankle just a little too far away from me that I could snatch my wrist away and run like I never ran before. A pretty ‚Äúnormal‚Äù case of having an encounter with molestation(?(he only exposed himself to me but never had an opportunity to touch)) right? Well, it‚Äôs not over.

After this incident I kept seeing him in town. I was little and afraid to tell mom, but we walked right past his car and he knocked on the glass to catch my attention then mockingly waved and smiled at me. The breath I took when I saw him froze in me. I was caught so off guard I couldn‚Äôt tell my mom, I just squeezed her hand and kept going.

Then he parked his car on the side if the road I went home (a completely different route than to my godparents) and parked in a way you couldn‚Äôt see him from the bushed only when you passed him. I was cycling home a little older and Inpass by him to see him jerk off in broad daylight. I recognized him and speeded up all the way I could. He started his car andtook off after me. The time he took to pull up his pants and get into his car was enough for me to hide in the sunflower field. He drove around and around but never found me.

Years later I had his white car and license plate engraved into my mind, flinching just at the sight of every white car. I remember this one particularly because of how ironic it is. I was going home from the bus stop thinking about how he could be anywhere fidgeting around the numbers of the licence plate in my mind....then THE car turns from a sideroad and it comes straight towards me. I remember thinking like a broken record ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt be this can‚Äôt be this can‚Äôt be‚Äù and as he reaches me he slows down and rolls the window to ask where the city I lived was. I didn‚Äôt even stop just answered his as I walked by and purposedly pointed the ipposite direction my town was and said ‚Äúthat way‚Äù so he would just go the fuck away and never come back. I never saw him again.

The only mentionable scar I have in psychological. As I said he never had a chance to touch me, but I don‚Äôt want to think about what could‚Äôve happened if he could. I ended up being socially weird and just being weird and tense around men overall. I know a lot of people have it way worse than I did and I‚Äôm not doubting that I‚Äôm just telling my experience."

mentalhealth,fmdvk5v,t3_fun99z,1585979354.0,"Being molested. Never raped I thank God for that but a former close family friend stopped me on my way home on a hot summer day. He‚Äôs an old dude over 60 maybe even 65 as I write this. I‚Äôm 21 now and was 16 when it happened. So we stopped to say hi and he was in his car window rolled down talking to me and I was right next to that talking to him. He says goodbye and asks ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt even say goodbye?‚Äù implying a formal kiss on the cheek since we were close at the time. It was weird but I was like okay that‚Äôs not a big deal only to lean in and have him grab my head with a force pulling me in his window and kiss me on the lips. Most disgustingly and I‚Äôll never forget that, he couldn‚Äôt resist said out loud ‚Äújust one more‚Äù forced me on his lips again and then let go. I cycled home crying. It probably hit hard because I previously experienced molestation and was especially paranoid and scared of something of this manner happening to me again and it did.

My first experience dates back to me just being 6, a first grader. On my way to my godfathers house from school a man stopped me in beaming daylight. Note that it‚Äôs a small town with 6000 people so I felt like it‚Äôs a safe haven where nothing bad happens - little did I know. So from somewhat 300-400 meters from my godfathers house is this man with his car in a totally sun lit dead end. He said ‚Äúcome here help me, show me where is xy place on the map I‚Äôm lost‚Äù Me being an open, helping and caring child I went up to his car. I believe I didn‚Äôt get to the actual door I stopped at the bumper because he rushed his actions but I wouldn‚Äôt swear on that, I‚Äôd liketo think it though. He got out of the car, completely naked downwards and touched himself, showing iff. He reached for my arm but couldn‚Äôt catch it. I ran away luckily but the torment wasn‚Äôt over. After that incident I saw him for years. While I was still at a younger age he‚Äôd be in a car just parking as my mom and I were going somewhere he‚Äôd knock on his glass and wave and smile to me. At the time I was so scared I was shocked to tell my mom. I saw him on my way home as a bigger girl. He parked on the side of the road and masturbated in daylight. No one said a thing. When I passed him with my cycle he got in the car and started chasing me down. Since it was daylight and there were - not so many - but just a few people on the road he wasn‚Äôt so obvious about it but he was clearly going after me. He didn‚Äôt find me because I ran into the sunflowers. Years later I met him once again. White cars just don‚Äôt do it to me since..."

I don‚Äôt even dare to think what would‚Äôve happened if he reaches his destination. People will look you in the eyes and smile but hold a knife behind their backs. Be cautious.

As about the story. What happened? Were there police involved? What does your parent say? Do you have any mental illnesses, traumas prior to this happening? Just asking, no judgement here. How old are you if I may ask? My first thought was that the psychiatrist tries to lessen your trauma by claiming that it never happened, but I really don‚Äôt know about that. Hope this post is fake, real or not it sounds terrible."

AmItheAsshole,fkxg0qw,t1_fkxc9vg,1584627341.0,Yeah he just wants to guilt trip her saying that.
Paranormal,fkn9eyd,t3_fjf06u,1584358950.0,"Mess with an ouija board and don‚Äôt say goodbye, visit likely haunted places like cementeries, old hospitals, psychiatries and disrespect the entities there, shout disrespectful things, break things, etc and of course go without any form of protection like any amulettes or medals. 10/10. Natural selection indeed."
Paranormal,fkn91wv,t1_fkn4p0k,1584358561.0,exactly lol
Paranormal,fkn8tqb,t3_fjeh7j,1584358319.0,I‚Äôm glad you said goodbye! It definitely must‚Äôve been scary but you learned a lesson. These things really aren‚Äôt to mess with. I hope everything is fine since then!
Paranormal,fkkho9c,t3_dmyi1b,1584284242.0,You have balls with a capital for effortlessly just opening your door and stare into your hallway for a few minutes after an experience like that!
Columbine,fk0091s,t1_fk006fk,1583735959.0,"He certainly did and that‚Äôs not the thing that‚Äôs bending the truth. Telling he was a follower is. He mentioned nbk in his journal first, never forget that."
Columbine,fjzzn3m,t1_fjzjo6q,1583735240.0,She acknowledges his actions but she also bends truth in order to portray something different than Dylan really was. She does acknowledge but she‚Äôs also putting a lot of blame off of him so it‚Äôs not a 100% truthful.
Survival,fjovqcu,t3_feerxo,1583535800.0,I have an insane talent for not being able to see what is done to the cord after the first two steps.

Eminem,fj4kank,t1_fj4iffw,1583010250.0,Well sorry for not knowing the whole discography
Eminem,fj4gbd9,t1_fj4g9fd,1583007597.0,Oh let me check that out! Thank you
Eminem,fj4g0t6,t1_fj46si5,1583007402.0,When it came out the first week they censored it like two times on Spotify then made it explicit again. It really took away from the experience. I was about to write a letter to his management or something but thank God they ended up changing it back. Lucky me
Eminem,fj4fo41,t1_fj4cemx,1583007168.0,What are drips please? Let me know
Columbine,fj3f6r6,t1_fbh0czv,1582981508.0,What did he do? I mean his OCD
