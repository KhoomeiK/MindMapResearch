EatingDisorders,fonjnxs,t3_g8h18e,1587920774.0,"For a while last year when I restricted the most I would kind of do this with fruit - I wouldn't necessarily call it a ""binge"" but at the same time would a normal person eat 6 pears every day for 2 weeks...? Bear in mind at this point in time I had only just realised I liked pears so was making up for 2 decades on lost time haha. Also did it a little with raspberries and particular apples. 

It stopped after I restricted as much as I think it only happened because that was basically the only safe foods I had and allowed myself to have more of it due to its low value in numbers. Once I became more comfortable with more types of food, I stopped craving fruit as much subconsciously - I only realise how things have changed so much later as everything was/ is such a gradual change"

books,fofzyaf,t3_g79cwo,1587745748.0,"Hello!

I'm looking for some good audiobooks particularly in the non fiction area - I really love medical/emergency services non fiction audiobooks as well as a historical true story. Previously I have enjoyed authors Adam Kay, Richard Shepherd, Kerry Daynes and  Sabrina Cohen-Hatten. I'm currently listening to Bill Bryson's The Body

Any recommendations would be fab!"
AnorexiaNervosa,fo7i7ba,t1_fo7hdzv,1587578762.0,Got any tips for loving the recovered body and sustaining the positive mindset?

52book,fg4lx0p,t1_fg37igk,1580506015.0,I've heard very mixed reviews for both of these books - people seem to love or hate them which has kinda put me off both. Is there a particular target audience for them that some people just don't fall into?

AnorexiaNervosa,f08v7ew,t1_f07lddo,1568488590.0,I used to be a scout leader a while ago so I'm being pushed into joining a new group and finding a pub quiz team but I can't get over how exhausting it is to pretend to be fine and comfortable infront of others and feel like I'm kinda lying to them all the time.
EatingDisorders,f05f1fr,t3_d3rwdi,1568408273.0,I also experienced this with a really bad aftertaste which was awful - the only thing I've found that helps is Pepto Bismol (an over the counter medicine) and not drinking fizzy drinks. Used to carry it everywhere with me just in case but thankfully it seems to have reduced as recovery has continued. :)
