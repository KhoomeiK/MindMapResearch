Eldenring,f7f13dr,t1_eqeermx,1573670137.0,"That‚Äôs a hard question to answer because it‚Äôs widely debated on what exactly ‚ÄúCeltic‚Äù culture is. It‚Äôs most commonly determined as the people and mythology of the british isles that was later influenced by the indo-european mythology of the germanic tribes i.e. anglo saxon. Norse mythology and common Germanic mythology share similar roots and are thought to have influenced one another due to close contact between these peoples over a long period of time. Their mythology and language mangled together and share common characteristics. This is believed to be why the Celtic, Germanic, and Nordic cultures are similar. Who influenced what and how is a chicken and egg scenario."
