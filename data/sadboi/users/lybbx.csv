depression,fhfwg5n,t3_f2zu8z,1581552924.0,"Yeah, same age and pretty much same story, kinda. I've spoken to therapists, doctors  nothing efficient. My mum knows (knew) but we never speak a word of it, at this point it feels like nothing happened, she doesnt know the full extent, like you I have had experiences with self harm and damn is it a pain to keep it away from family and professionals. Anyways, school is a good choice if you feel your mum isnt listening properly, cause soon enough your life turns into a bigger hell day by day, and it starts to get noticable in your voice and actions. Idk how I'm alive, but appreciate life atm, we're young, ask school for help (You probably have wellbeing services (counselling etc...) that can help you)."
depression,ffv5szc,t1_ffus8ay,1580256361.0,"For the last couple months of me asking anyone for advice, I feel this is the best thing I heard somehow. It feels like you've described I've wanted. I certainly haven't been in CBT for a year, I've been in for quite little sessions, less than 10. I feel worse and worse after every session I've had and it feels right to be on anti-depressants rather than speaking, I appreciate your version of events being shared."
depression,ffuqx6q,t3_evbzqt,1580247627.0,"I feel like this regularly, I'm a youngun, and i'm always told about ""the future"", I know the inevitable will eventually catch up with me and I'll lose control more than I currently do and i'll ""go"". The advice I get told regularly is knowing that your not alone, other people feel identical to you, like me. Attempt to take your mind off yourself when you get you burst of emotions, music, gaming, tv (yeah very introverted ik), sporting, etc...  its what I do and I rarely break."

depression,fdzbh3w,t1_fdz9hti,1578788521.0,"Told my parents 2 weeks ago, they brought me to my local GP who suggested therapy. I didn't answer all questions truthfully though, my mum was next door and imagining the fear and worry on her face if the doctor made me go to a specialist psychiatrist would drive me so far. Currently all but a few people who know think its just a reoccurring sadness that's nothing severe. The courage to say the truth was too much for me. I'm yet to speak to a therapist, I believe I have a session next week, but I feel I need something daily to get me through a day, I was hoping for anti-depressants, but for it to be given to minors is only if its severe, which it didn't appear to the doctor to be. My coping mechanism is Netflix rn tbh, when I get my intense feelings I'm straight to Netflix, before this I used to do stupid things."
depression,fdz7mkb,t3_enf8go,1578787497.0,"I feel similar tbh, I have had many opportunities to not wake up in the morning, I'm unable to do anything though. The guilt I would feel for my parents would 

1) stop me mid act 

2) Make me feel so much worse, and more difficult to get the will to wake up.

Its so scary having these thoughts, especially at my age (Under 16) as I'm consistently getting worse daily and don't want to grow old suffering. My tolerance before I break gets stronger, the more people I have to speak to; but I also feel better when alone, I desire being with friends, and being alone. Its the most intense pain I've experienced when in my worst stages and feeling like this, its torture. I'm getting off topic, basically I would feel more intense thoughts each time I'd attempt but never go through,"
depression,fdz58iv,t3_en7336,1578786803.0,"Getting help, and telling someone you trust was the hardest step for me along with maintaining control, however the anxiety I felt after speaking to the doctor was immense, I found it quite difficult. I personally haven't been suffering for long and am still accepting my emotions but I do understand that it fills a hole in my heart, I wouldn't be me without this. It brings a sense of completion to me, I feel human with this and I'm not missing anything of myself."
