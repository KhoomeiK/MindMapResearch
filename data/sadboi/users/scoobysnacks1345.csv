Chains make money because they can move volumes, and sometimes have ""loss leaders"" to get people into the store. and then they purchase higher gp items....

We had a family member take out a LOC for us, which we used, as no banks etc would take the risk in the 90's.    You will, most likely have to go thru private financing, if this is the route you are going to go......It's very stressful, not knowing if you are going to make $1 that day or hundreds.  What if your business had to shut down, like in a pandemic?  Then what?   Will you need employees?  Or will you work 7 days a week?  How do you pay EI portions etc, if you have employees?  How much do you charge for things?  How much is your mark up?  Marketing?  Etc...

I'm not saying your idea isn't great...... Just be careful, and look at the businesses going under right now?  and why?"

TorontoRealEstate,f6ou51p,t3_dsabsl,1573035142.0,"It's not always about being the highest bidder....... sometimes a ""stronger offer"", is one with no conditions, a shorter/longer closing date, and whether or not it is a ""cash offer"".  

In my opinion, as a seller, in the past, it's not about the size of your downpayment etc, so don't worry too much  about that part.  

All you can really do, is offer what you are comfortable paying.. lf you need conditions, so be it.....  I've heard that sometimes a personal letter , explaining why you want this property, sometimes pulls a bit of weight with the heartstrings of the sellers......
