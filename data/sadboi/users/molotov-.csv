Ancient Greece was sexist, but Greece wasn't a homogenous country until very late in history, so it varies a lot by region. Some cults and some regions were also matriarchal, such as the maenads of Dionysus and a certain cult of Ares that only allowed women. So that statement is a bit debatable. 

The goddesses like Athena and Artemis are virgins because they choose no man. Virginity was a deeply social concept that was largely about independence.

I do it because part of my soul is inside it the same way part of your soul is given away to your mother or your wife or your child, when you love them. If your child was dying, you'd make them comfortable and you'd protect them while being well aware this is the end for them.

So I don't have much of an argument if you don't experience nature that way. But I'm very happy you do these things. I think you should keep doing them even if the end will eventually come, because our time is limited regardless of climate change, same goes for nature. It will die eventually, everything will.

AskReddit,exr0r3c,t1_exqzpng,1566509701.0,"Nope! Permaculture has systems to combat this exact thing. For example, you plant perennials appropriate to your soil and climate rather than annuals, which hold the soil together with their roots to protect it from wind and rain erosion. You can implement hugelkultur, which works by *adding* soil rather than digging more and more. The roots (which die and regenerate constantly) and mulch create organic matter, and the no-till system allows the soil organisms to flourish, thereby constantly keeping the soil rich and fertile. If you sustain a permaculture garden started in very, very poor soil, it will turn into rich black loam after a few years, this is proven by everyone who has tried it."

Like I told you before, it's by no means *the* solution, it's not the only thing we can or should do. But it's a solution to consumerism, which will boycott the private companies, and it's a way to massively reduce waste and your carbon footprint."

It's something individuals can do to produce small, slow changes that take root over time rather than quickly. But it can be applied in other areas of your life, for example if you plan to buy a house, permaculture has various water conservation techniques, ways to plan the layout of a house so you need less heating/cooling, etc. This can be applied to public buildings too, on a large scale. Reuse everything you possibly can, even things you don't think you can reuse - do you want to plant something in your balcony? Don't buy a pot, punch some holes in a plastic milk container and use that. It's little things like that and they can be integrated more thoroughly everywhere to produce larger change. Permaculture has an entire set of principles behind it which aren't limited to farming or gardening, so the applications are extensive if you're creative, but no, it's not the end all be all of environmentalism."
AskReddit,exqowi8,t1_exqnem7,1566505420.0,"Yes! You can look up permaculture designs, and there's also forums that discuss stuff like this. It can work on even a balcony garden, to a lesser extent. Without knowing the layout of your garden or your zone, I can give some basic tips:

1. Hugelkultur. That's a no-irrigation system. You make a little mound of dead wood, add soil on top (don't dig), and plant the tomatoes there. People who do it say that their vegetables taste better and there's videos showing green, lush hugelkultur beds in the middle of very dry, desert-like areas. 

2. Plant a nitrogen fixing plant next to the tomato, such as any in the legume family.

3. Look into companion planting, to see which plants harm tomatoes and which ones have beneficial relationships with them.

5. Instead of wasting weeds, mulch them. Those with deep taproots pull up nutrients from the subsoil and store them in their leaves, they're a perfect fertilizer and mulch doubles as weed control."

AskReddit,exq3wxe,t1_expwe21,1566497594.0,"Sustainable agriculture. It's both an agricultural system and a way of life. There's lots of info on it online as well as books (Gaia's Garden By Toby Hemenway is a good starter). It's basically a zero-waste system that tries to mimic nature entirely, resulting in less effort, more efficiency, and multifunctionality both in a garden and in life. 

An example would be - grow a plant that is susceptible to aphids alongside a plant that attracts ladybugs, which are aphid predators. Those plants can also be edible, so you also have food for your chickens, which create manure, lightly till, and provide eggs. One of those plants might also be a legume, which fixes nitrogen in the soil and in turn helps other plants around it thrive, and on it goes. You create ecosystems in your garden and work with nature rather than against it. You create beneficial relationships between each component in your garden, the way a forest would. It gets far more complex than this though, those are very small scale examples.
