I‚Äôve remember reading about how more selection typically messes peoples judgement up. My favorite example was how successful McDonald‚Äôs was when they had four options on the menu and how deceiving making started to slow down when items were added to the menu.

If you book a date and a more attractive man comes along she‚Äôll probably just bump you and then bump that guy when the same thing happens. When I was on tinder and bumble I‚Äôd always try and set something up for as soon as they were free. I was a lot more successful when I‚Äôd just meet on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Of course, when using those app you have to realize they‚Äôre probably dating 3-5 guys and will continue this for 1-2 months to match a guy.

If you‚Äôre a jealous guy it‚Äôll probably show and you‚Äôll get dropped off. I‚Äôve said it before but if my current relationship of 2.5 years fails (yes we met on bumble), I think I‚Äôm done with online dating. Not worth the time or eventual headache."

There are a lot of great things in this profession but like everything in life you have to work very hard for them. I just happen to believe you can put the same effort into something that pays a lot better and gives you more free time to be with family and friends."
architecture,ffmk37q,t3_eu3evd,1580055804.0,"Well I just spent over an hour typing a very long and thorough breakdown of the profession only to have the app freeze and erase everything.

So I‚Äôll break it down very simple. Research good schools that cover everything from design, construction (estimating, building, management), history, business, communication/marketing, building codes/life safety/ADA, structures... did I mention business?!

Make sure to get an internship. Find the person you want to be in that firm and I bet they are over 40/45 and not even clearing $100k salary and most certainly not just designing awesome buildings all day long. By the way when you look for an internship you‚Äôll probably need to know some kind of CAD program such as AutoCAD. If not AutoCAD it would be good to know a BIM program such as Revit or ArchiCAD. It would probably also be very beneficial to know a simple 3D modeling program such as sketchup or blender. You would be even better off if you knew a 3D modeling program such as 3D studio Max, Maya, or rhino. I would say you definitely should know how to use Photoshop and or illustrator as well.

I truly recommends getting an undergraduate degree in something a lot more recession proof that architecture which lives and dies by the economy. Business, accounting, nursing, medical... Hell I know plumbers that make $125-150k, which is twice as much as me. My girlfriend is a fantastic hair stylist and makeup artist that makes me that I do working 4 days a week with the occasional wedding once every two months. If she just focused on weddings she‚Äôd easily make $150k a year... before tips!

I‚Äôm a licensed architect and I‚Äôve gone from designing a 30,000 square foot home to small remodels in no time after the 2007/2008 housing collapse. Then once you‚Äôve completed your undergraduate go for a masters in architecture that way you have a stable base and some real life experience first. Or maybe never return to school and take on architecture as a hobby. One of the best designers I work with has an undergraduate degree in history. His father was an architect but still, he has one of the best hands and spatial awareness I‚Äôve ever seen. 

Make sure to go to NCARB‚Äôs website and research what it takes to finish your AXP hours before you can sit for your first of six lengthy exams to become a licensed architect. Maybe you live in a state where you don‚Äôt have to do through this process like Colorado‚Äôs DORA regulations. 

I can‚Äôt retype everything again. I‚Äôm very cynical and seriously would just recommend going to school for something that people actually appreciate and pay well. Computer programming has a negative unemployment rate. I know guys making $150-200/hour sitting at home in front of their computers. I know a registered nurse that works three 16 hour days making $350,000/year. I don‚Äôt know a single architect that has cleared over $100,000/year consistently for the last 10 years, without being the owner of a large firm with at least 5-10 people working for them...NOT A SINGLE ONE!!

I‚Äôll mention it one last time. Get a great education that actually involves real world learning in architecture (OR BUSINESS...Did I mention business) and make sure your degree is from an ACCREDITED ARCHITECTURE program or you can just double/triple all your required internship hours. 

Feel free to ask any questions you have about the profession and I will try to answer them as honestly as I can. Oh, by the way I do not see this as a fear of competition from you or younger generations. When I internshipped in high school, I had several architects tell me all the exact same thing that I am telling you now and I ignored all of them because I thought they were just trying to not have more competition in the future. I can tell you for a fact that they were trying to look out for my best well-being in the very near future."
