pettyrevenge,fmvxmm4,t3_fxnlgv,1586434283.0,"I had a guy who was also messaging me almost on a daily basis and wouldn’t accept no for an answer. I got tired one day of it and after he asked me if I wanted to meet him I said yes, he said he wanted sex so I responded I wanted a threesome with his wife (obviously I was joking). He got excited about the idea but told me to take a girlfriend of mine. 
I said I could bring a male friend, he kept asking me to bring a girl.
I said he should bring his girl (had a ~3yo kid). He blocked me from everywhere and I never heard from him again. So maybe if they have kids this could be a way of making them stop bothering you? Or you just block them instead 😅"

AmItheAsshole,fi8780i,t3_f6vqy9,1582234746.0,"I was wondering this week why I get getting asked by strangers to smile. I asked my boyfriend and this has never happened to him, is this a thing? Are girls supposed to be happy all the time no matter what? 

I also was asked today my age because I wanted to take the elevator, this guy said (in a nice way) that ppl under 30 should take the stairs and not be lazy, but I’m very sick and didn’t have the energy, and Idk why I should explain myself for taking an elevator. I wish that ppl stop telling me what to do if they have no idea what I’m going through. I want to think is not that they have bad intentions but it still bothers me a lot.

So... ppl who do this, WHY?"

He told me he went to many stores and was asking for engagement rings that didn’t cost more than 200€ and people were giving him bad looks and thinkis he was too cheap 😅
I’m really glad he didn’t spend too much on it and it’s absolutely beautiful, he bought it on internet from Canada.

It’s a bit big but he said we can get it fixed.

I’ve been in good and not so good relationships in my past, but nothing compares to what I have with him, he’s a very clever, kind, good looking, honest and funny human being, it always amazes me how great he is, so loving him is really easy, and after 4 years of relationship and 3 years of living together I believe we know each other very well."
casualiama,eqrdwct,t1_eqrbn26,1560258178.0,"Thank you and congratulations to you too! 
We’re very happy indeed, it was very unexpected for me but I already knew with no doubts that he’s the guy I’m gonna spend my life with :) 

I was in Berlin once and did Couchsurfing, stayed friends with my host and the second time I was visiting the city I wanted to meet him again. That day he was doing sports with a friend so he asked his friend (my now fiancé) if he wanted to grab a beer  after practice.  We all went to a store, got some beers but my friend left us earlier and we really clicked. I often think that the chances of meeting him were very low, I’m a very lucky girl.

I actually never thought this could happen to me, and I used to believe that if I love someone I didn’t need it to be written in a paper, but turns out I’m a helpless romantic after all.

How did you guys met? And how did he propose?"
casualiama,eqr6m8z,t1_eqr5a6r,1560250716.0,"Thank you :) 
My boyfriend asked me.
We have been together for 4 years now and wanted to celebrate, so he was cooking something special, but it took him ~6 hours to get everything ready, by the end I was angry and hungry and he didn’t asked at the end as planned. Then we went out looking for the store we first met, had some beers next to it, came back home and had wine in the balcony and listened to some music, and then he asked 🙂 I feel a bit bad that I ruined the initial plan for being hungry tho."
