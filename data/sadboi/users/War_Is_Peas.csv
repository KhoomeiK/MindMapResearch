spotify,fejtrxg,t3_epdxi9,1579185665.0,"Fad Gadget does a version of Cage's 4'33"" that, as far as I can tell, is completely silent. You'll find it, along with **fifty-seven other cover versions** on Mute Records' compilation album, [""STUMM433"" (spotify album link)](https://open.spotify.com/album/4sdtB1gvaJbNbC0cH486bO?si=MevRLKXmQQSFNnRrlHMuuA).

As nazgul_123 astutely noted, 4:33 < 5:00. If you need at least 5 minutes *minimum* then track 1 on the fourth disc, (*4'33""* by Pink Grease) is listed as 5:09. **I have *not* listened to that track** and have no idea how 'Pink Grease' interpreted the work other than extending it by 36 seconds. Hopefully at least one of these tracks works for your purposes."

If don't go right to bed, I'll try to hold out but eventually I'll give in and eat everything in sight. Worse than weed munchies cause my rational brain doesn't get a say. When I wake up 7-8hrs later I'm still over-full and it hurts. I'll feel like that till I take a good shit."
