Der Sommer naht und das weckt einfach meine Lebensgeister. Nächste Woche werde ich 29. Sonst war ich immer eher melancholisch drauf wenn mein alter ein +1 bekommen hat, aber dieses Jahr stört es mich wenig, auch wenn es den Anschein hat, dass das Gegenteil der Fall ist. Ich mache oft Witze darüber, dass meine 20er sich dem Ende neigen.

Das Leben ist einfach schön manchmal. Man sollte in den Zeiten, in denen einem gut geht richtig ausnutzen auf welchem Weg auch immer, weil irgendwann wieder schwerere Zeiten kommen.

Ich bin einfach glücklich und darüber bin ich froh.

Mit meinen Mitmenschen komme ich richtig gut aus und das gibt mir einfach noch mehr das Gefühl gut drauf zu sein.

Und natürlich ist morgen wieder Freitag. Also gute Laune.

Sonst gibt es in meinem Leben nicht viel Neues, aber das ist auch nicht immer verkehrt, wenn der Status Quo gut ist.

Aus dem Stegreif würde ich erstmal nichts ändern wollen. So wie es jetzt ist kann es gerne noch ne Weile bleiben."

We both have younger brothers and both are the same age. We were kids when we decided that we should make our brothers become best friends as well. Our plan worked out and they are too inseparable.
