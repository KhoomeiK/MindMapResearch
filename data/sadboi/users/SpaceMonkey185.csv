depression,fbjmmbd,t3_edhcd2,1576936381.0,Yes I used to feel like this and I hated it. Everybody just talking around me. Me waiting for an opportunity to say something that adds to the conversation and never getting it. Once I stopped caring what people thought of me though I became much more social. I'm no longer the shy akward guy.
microdosing,fbjm0re,t3_edm9bz,1576936070.0,Looks great. I've been wanting to do this. How do you make your labels?

FloatTank,fbfe5b7,t3_ed3636,1576808380.0,My girfreind and I are going this weekend for our first float and we are stoaked. She was worried about claustrophobia but it doesn't seem to be an issue from what we've researched. Don't psyche yourself out. One of the many benefits of a float is anxiety relief. I would say go in without taking it to get a baseline for how it makes you feel. It should be a very theraputic experience. Let us know how it goes.

And being married to someone from another religion was unthinkable. I once witnessed a pastor shame a male member during a sermon for having long hair. He never came back."
