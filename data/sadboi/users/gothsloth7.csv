IdiotsInCars,fpuanzj,t1_fptbrsi,1588908381.0,"I was in an accident EXACTLY like this. The guy I t-boned was in a van, I was in a tiny little car. I got out of my car limping and bleeding from my nose and head. The guy RAN over to me just to cuss me out for hitting him, meanwhile I was barely conscious lmao."
IdiotsInCars,fpdn41r,t1_fpdkxm0,1588530264.0,I know. Just wanted to remind everyone that weird things are possibleüò¨
IdiotsInCars,fpdie7h,t3_gcn3wk,1588527588.0,"I don't know shit about physics but I will say this:
Assuming the oncoming car was going slow like some have said, even if the cam car was going 70-75 mph, they could have survived.
I'm basing this off the fact that I've been in a head on collision where the other car was going maybe 20 mph and I was going 65 mph. The airbags went off and I came out with some heavy bruises and a bloody nose. And of course a totalled car."
relationship_advice,fnjs30t,t1_fnjrk7s,1587005690.0,"This is one of my biggest fears, and you're probably right. I'm actually afraid I've ended good relationships because of this, but I just don't know how to break the cycle and stop wondering if there's something better out there."
Eyebleach,fkikhl3,t1_fkijydc,1584222147.0,It's not necessary for a blood draw. The opening created by the needle is not enough for infection to occur and there are no diseases transmissible by blood between humans and dogs.
mentalhealth,fha00h1,t1_fh9ztd6,1581393646.0,"Because I need a degree for the career I want. The stress isn't related to the topics, just class and studying in general. I think we're all prone to stress from these things, it's natural. But I am wondering why it has such an affect on my physical health."
depression,ff1ade6,t3_eqyyej,1579476837.0,"I totally agree. my mom always says ""my daughters attract the most broken people"" and ""you two (referring to my sister and I) have always had a weird desire to fix people"".

She has yet to realize we attract/want to ""fix"" all of these ""broken"" people because we are broken ourselves."
mentalhealth,fdxc1np,t3_en8h3z,1578767284.0,That is so awesome to hear! A lot of life is about forming positive habits. I hope this can become some sort of routine for you to replace what you would normally do instead. Keep at it! :)
depression,fdp8fnr,t1_fdp1fu2,1578622436.0,I'm so sorry to hear that... It really sucks. Especially when you get a job where everyone would have common interests.
depression,fdnkmxo,t1_fdnjg0g,1578587786.0,"I travel when I can, mostly alone (something I don't enjoy because of my anxiety, I just wish I had at least one person to go with). I ended up quitting my job after 5 months because I felt so out of place. It was a weird feeling, because I was so happy to have so much in common with my coworkers. But then I noticed a lot of them becoming friends and hanging out outside of work but nobody wanted to do that with me. I was an outcast still, even with like-minded people. I'm 20 years old and will be graduating in about 4 months. I'm particularly scared because I have no friends or partner to move in with when I leave the dorms. Living alone scares me, mostly because I get lonely and isolate myself more until I'm spending days at a time in bed."
depression,fdnhc1e,t3_emaxm4,1578585814.0,"I did something similar except my deadline was the end of college. Because I thought everything would change if i moved far away for college. It's been two years now. I haven't made any friends. I've even tried visiting other nearby cities, getting a job in something I enjoy, taking extra classes, playing Pokemon Go, and dating apps. Nothing good is happening and im scared ill never feel better and i'll be alone forever."
ISTJ,fbtk436,t3_ee88oz,1577081912.0,"As a lazy istj, this is never any good for me. I'm too lazy to make plans myself every single time. But I need to have a set plan. This is probably why I don't have many friends lol. Most of my friends either say ""here is exactly what we are going to do"" and I will show up, or we make a specific plan together and I show up. No plan, no go."

I definitely need to have more charms and crystals and such around to help focus my intentions."
witchcraft,f55ivp5,t1_f50w0ju,1572008286.0,"Thank you so much, this is all so helpful!! I really like the idea of finding new ways to process emotions and setting good intentions. I'll definitely be referencing this post in the future!"
witchcraft,f55idx7,t1_f4zfb79,1572008030.0,"Thank you for responding!!
I actually do think a cleansing of my apartment is in order. I have two roommates who normally want nothing to do with witchcraft, but the energy in our apartment is so bad they agreed to join me in cleansing the entire place for Samhain.
Thanks for all the advice!"

asexuality,f4asbl5,t1_f46zbhn,1571500539.0,"That would actually make sense. I used to think it was the other way around (asexual, biromantic). But it really seems to be the actual relationship and being 'romantic' that I get sick of."

asexuality,f0yz41c,t1_f0yn0ze,1569082315.0,"Thank you for responding, this made me feel a lot less.. Weird. The feeling of relief you described is so familiar to me. Also the way people make such a big deal out of kissing (like having a goodbye kiss at the end of your relationship). I just don't really understand why people enjoy it. It's just something I've always done because someone else wanted to, it never quite occurred to me that I found it gross or annoying."
asexuality,f0yyj6q,t1_f0y5ita,1569081893.0,It does suck to hear this but I've been thinking the same thing. Thank you for being blunt and to the point with me!
mentalhealth,f0h2kac,t3_d4opwy,1568611521.0,"I can definitely say I relate to this. Getting coffee can be so expensive for what it really is, in my opinion. It's the small things that really matter tho ‚ô•Ô∏è"
