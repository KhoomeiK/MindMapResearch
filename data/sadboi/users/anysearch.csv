JusticeServed,fpl5sih,t1_fpl4vf7,1588706876.0,"in a life or death situation would you rather have the cop who was incapable of physically overpowering the assailant or the cop who quickly took him to the ground. i frequent police activity youtube channel and i've seen on multiple occasions where a woman police officer was pleading with a larger man to please submit to arrest then as soon as a male officer arrives they are quickly subdued. it's a matter of being unable to overpower uncooperative criminals and relying on backup. where in truly dangerous situations someone could get badly hurt.
edit: i looked for the video i'm referring to and the man tells the officer ""i'm bigger than you"" and she is effectively trying to convince the man to be arrested rather than being capable of doing it by force. (it was a domestic dispute and she tells him he's under arrest probably 20 times and is non-compliant)"

The UI takes some getting used to as the hit section ends up in your peripheral vision if your screen is too big. I'm level 92 so far and I still don't have every song unlocked. If you like rythm games this is a great one. I hope the lack of success this game has had doesn't put the developers out of business because although they need to give more options visually they are fantastic at making note tracks. Almost all songs were made in house as well. I say this is a good buy.

He showers for an hour straight right away and he shaves and better smell okay when he gets out. He can play games but if he doesn't spend at least 2 hours everyday for the next month doing things that improve his situation then what's the point. I can't imagine a girl even liking me if I was gross and smelly. You guys share a bed, you probably stink by proxy and don't even notice.  Be stern and be direct.

mentalhealth,fijd61k,t1_fijc0fp,1582442803.0,"Start loving yourself. You'll stop often. But just be that person in your life who loves you. People always look for happiness in others, they want others to fill a void. But you need to be that person for yourself.if you're mad at something you said to your mom you need to forgive yourself, that doesn't mean you're okay with being a dick but that you give yourself the freedom to be human and to make mistakes without worrying about how you're going to treat yourself when you mess up. You need to realize that everyone on the planet is having a tough time in one way or another. Mental health makes things tough because we're not like average people so people don't know or understand most of the time and can't give advice that will work. You need to put value into your life, my whole life I've hated school and working, but now I'm on disability and I sit at home on Reddit all day with no joy because I have no life. I'm slowly working on getting myself hobbies like exercise and art but life doesn't feel easy, even though as far most people would think I have a nice lazy life, but in reality I've never had more trouble coping with everyday. Like I said man, I'd start writing things down. Talk to yourself in the future. If you have anxiety or an issue complain to yourself in a text to your own phone number as if you were unloading on the perfect therapist. Then go back and read what you wrote to yourself and pretend it wasn't you that wrote it. What advice do you have for that guy? Probably really good stuff. Just like I'm doing for you now. My life may be very hard but I've developed coping strategies that keep me from hurting myself. I still think about suicide often. But I have several people who I know, they aren't all close but it's important to me that they don't have to watch me kill myself after they tried to help me. I know that last bit is dark but I just need you to know that life has things for you but you need to be a good person to feel like you deserve it when life does something nice for you. You're going to mess up again, you're going to piss people off, you're going to have bad relationships and lose jobs because of your mouth if you're anything like me but Karma doesn't just exist on Reddit. ' we all know people who have everything that it would take to be happy... And they are not happy.. because they want something else or they want more of the same. We also know people who are misfortunate, and they are deeply happy.. why? Because they're greatful' 

 For me it was really truly recognizing mom as a person. She was a kid, went to school, went thru some shit and eventually had a kid then kept getting older. When I make her sad I feel bad and want to do better. She's the same as one your buddies but she's part of you. Dunno man. As I get older I worry more and more about my mom getting old and dying. Spend time together while you're still healthy and alive . My ex girlfriend's brother killed himself last week. It can be over tomorrow. Just try to make peace with what the world is"
mentalhealth,fijbqm1,t1_fijb958,1582441142.0,"I think this is the place to say what's on your mind. I tell everyone about all my problems and normal people aren't equipped to help you, so you can tell lots of stuff every now and then to close people after a good chunk of time where you aren't burdening them. Talk to yourself in your head about situations. Talk to people who don't always agree with you and try to understand new perspectives instead of thinking you're always right. A public/private forum like this is the perfect spot to unload into the world. Quietly mind you because this sub seems dead. I just discovered it tonight. But also seek professional help. Especially if the country you live in offers something. I brushed off feeling anxious for too many years and I had too many breakdowns that it caught up with me. I'm the last person to be giving advice but I can maybe offer a little insight into what it's like to feel like this a little later in life (I'm 31)"
mentalhealth,fijawjp,t3_f85shd,1582440202.0,Hey man. I went years not talking to my mom and I haven't talked to my sister in like a year. But my mom and I reconnected and we try to spend Mondays seeing eachother. At the end of the day I am the one who is mentally ill so i need to take responsibility for the things that I've done but there is sometimes more to a situation than black and white. I did horrible in school. It took me 6 years to finish highschool but in the end I still made it through college. My mental health always had to come before money and other people. My recommendation is to just start working on yourself. I don't mean study more or be a better sibling. I mean work towards being a better human. Anytime you do something you're unhappy with and you notice write it down.  Forgot to brush your teeth? Journal. Beat yourself up about a mistake you made? Journal.noticed that you weren't enjoying something like you should? Journal. For me I know it's silly but I write all over myself that I need to love myself. I am my mistakes but I want to do better. Apologize to your family often and sincerely and one day you'll be a family again. Hope this helps
