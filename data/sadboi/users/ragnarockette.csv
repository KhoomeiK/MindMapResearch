I think the meeting with Ben happened (by chance) and he saw Ben’s lifestyle living high off the Christian influencer hog. That looked attractive to a has-been loser, so he probably dove in and calculated how to get the setup with Jinger. I guarantee he did all the research to figure out what would appeal to her - moving to a big city, dressing well, etc.

I think the move to LA (versus going to seminary at a college closer to Arkansas) was on purpose - he doesn’t want to have to *actually* interact with her family or be held to true fundie standards. It also means less involvement from JB. 

He’s loves the built in following, TV show, pretty, vapid wife, and I think he sees a major opportunity to be a conservative Christian influencer power couple, but it’s all an act! I’d be surprised if he believes much at all.

Now we’re transitioning to the onus of responsibility being on the individual, which is rough for many and will likely result in more deaths, but I think is unavoidable in this country.

I don’t think the resurgences will be as bad as others are predicting. As a city we’ve actually done a great job at containing, and with no festivals, closed bars, I think it will be a while before tourists start venturing back in numbers enough to be meaningful - good for health, bad for economy. Lots of businesses will close and a lot of folks will be out of work. Honestly, I think most of the restaurants that locals love will be fine - it will be the Mulates and the Starbucks near the Convention Center that close, which is still sad and hard for the workers, but I don’t subscribe to the idea that we’re going to lose our charm, our charm is way stronger than COVID.

Hopefully more government stimulus is coming, but probably not. Housing prices will drop, and rich people will make a lot of money buying houses and struggling businesses. I expect a bump in crime as well, since job loss is going to disproportionately impact the poor. Probably a spike in births too...

Probably no big events until 2021. I think Mardi Gras *will* happen but there will certainly be more restrictions and they will probably use COVID as an excuse to do stuff they want to do anyway (like moving Endymion).

Mask usage will probably stay fairly common in stores, gyms, but I expect people will return to bars and restaurants (where you’re eating and drinking and talking a lot) as normal, though some set of the population will continue to self isolate. I am guessing when music venues open masks will be mandatory for 6-12 months. 

On the bright side I think we’ll see a lot of innovation - new businesses and products, way more delivery infrastructure, way cleaner everything, maybe even some cool stuff like pop up restaurants in the park, drive in theaters, etc. Mask fashion will become a thing. “Crisis” means both tragedy and opportunity. 

We have the hospital beds, we have the makeshift clinic at the Convention Center - we are at the very least *ready* to medically support another spike. Let’s be kind to each other, do what we can personally, and recognize the rock and a hard place that the entire world is in.

ETA: Football is happening, and I actually think there will be fans at the game, though at a reduced capacity and with masks and super crazy entry/exit procedures. I wouldn’t be surprised if Saints give out Who Dat masks at Game 1 (similar to the way they often give out towels)."
