Beyond voting for larger community issues during elections, they should get no say about who else lives in that neighborhood. The fallacy that the so-called WWC embrace as truth - that's it's THEIR neighborhood - is prejudiced, racist and classist rubbish. On the left it's the NIMBY crowd that does the same thing."
work,eynivw7,t3_cxqaho,1567249503.0,"I'll put it in a nutshell: That is a terrible place to work. The owner is a lousy businessman and it's entirely likely that place won't be there in a year. If you could run it with 2 workers and have 5 on duty - that is bad business. The spying on workers by the owner AT HOME (as if he has nothing else to do) is egregious as well.

Honestly, get out on your own terms. That store is poorly run."
BPD,eynidoa,t3_cxoc3f,1567249108.0,"My issue is that I feel far more and want far more than the other person is willing to give. Then I get upset and march off when, perhaps, a more casual relationship was what made sense. Then I sit for months depressed that I ruined what might have been a good thing because the other person wasn't showering me with adoration just to prove to me that they cared.

Frankly, I've smothered people with my going from zero to madly-in-love at a glance. That's all on me."
Anxiety,eykov1r,t3_cx9gbk,1567162819.0,You will be able to enjoy all of those things soon so you can look forward to that. All those things you love about family.
BPD,eykolpt,t3_cx9mee,1567162502.0,"What is your comfort place - whether physically or mentally? Find a way to retreat into that space when you can just to stabilize the thoughts. For me, it's music. For others, it's binge-watching a TV show that makes them feel good. Figure out your safe-place and use it to your advantage."
work,eykntiq,t3_cxefdt,1567161502.0,"Getting along with people at work is often a combination of basic friendliness, work efficiency and wariness. Maybe some people are your friends, but work isn't a playground or the bar you hang out in with your buddies. It's work. People carve out their own little corner of it and guard it jealously."
BPD,eyknp3l,t3_cwytkx,1567161343.0,"I can't say that therapy ""cured"" me, but it did help me see things in a way that made me feel less like a piece of flotsam adrift on the sea. I tell myself constantly that I'm the one in control - the person who thinks and reasons. I have to believe that and act on it because I spent too many years allowing every little emotion to jerk me in this direction or that. I have to be in control of those things I can control - like my actions."
