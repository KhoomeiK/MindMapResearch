relationship_advice,fodddom,t1_foddc82,1587683279.0,Youâ€™re right. ðŸ˜­
relationship_advice,fodd79c,t1_fodd1hf,1587683213.0,I really donâ€™t want to look dumb. Because I know how I look at dudes that try to shoot their shot in my dms. ðŸ¤£
legaladvice,foblfog,t1_fobj6wq,1587661018.0,"Thereâ€™s no contract, like nothing that proves I work there at all. Red flag. Heâ€™s definitely a doctor though! Iâ€™ve already googled him. He has all his licenses, etc."
jobs,fob6wmk,t1_fob6utz,1587656758.0,Thanks!
relationship_advice,fnmy5o8,t3_g2c0gd,1587080462.0,"GET OUT OF THERE!! N O W! He does not plan on having your consent! He never even has brought this up with you either. It sounds like he has a rape fetish and wants to see someone rape you. The age gap is also very alarming and a huge red flag. Please, call your parents, friends, anyone you have. I know we are in a pandemic, but this will not be over soon. You canâ€™t wait until this is all over. You have to act ASAP!"
relationship_advice,fmua35b,t1_fmtyzps,1586387379.0,"I honestly never noticed him until I was 15 & then at that time I started going out more & walking to the store, etc. so Iâ€™d have to pass his garage & he rarely talked to me until I was 18. Like he knew exactly when I was 18, as if heâ€™d been asking my brothers or something. But yes thatâ€™s true to see attractiveness no matter what age but to see & to be is 2 different things."
relationship_advice,fmtv0s0,t1_fmttkwv,1586379490.0,Thank God he moved away!
relationship_advice,fmtg9vc,t1_fmte0lo,1586372207.0,"Itâ€™s super weird. Itâ€™d be different if he just approached me without knowing my exact age. But he literally is seeking out young women, and itâ€™s still like not knowing what youâ€™re doing completely because 18 isnâ€™t far from 16 and still so young, same with being 20."
relationship_advice,fmtdvo4,t1_fmtds0p,1586371071.0,It happened last year and Iâ€™m so sad that I didnâ€™t tell anyone. I feel like maybe it wouldnâ€™t matter because I feel like I led him on?
depression,fgdxs01,t1_fgdwiog,1580688128.0,Sooo annoying omg
depression,fbz01lo,t3_ef4960,1577231062.0,I totally understand. I love December so much but this year.. iâ€™m just not feeling it. I canâ€™t even believe Christmas is tomorrow nor do I care. Maybe bc iâ€™m broke.ðŸ˜­
depression,fbssix5,t3_ee8ixe,1577059764.0,"If you donâ€™t know how to start fresh, make a list of the tiniest things that you think youâ€™ll be happier living with or happier living without. And then give yourself the goal of fulfilling that list."
depression,fbrhlj9,t1_fbhvurg,1577042934.0,"Itâ€™s never â€˜so happy itâ€™s painfulâ€™ because even though iâ€™m happy, i feel as though itâ€™s not real because it wonâ€™t last. In my chest, I feel my heart is heavy, sad and empty. I feel empty so often. I donâ€™t remember a time where I havenâ€™t felt empty. Only times when I just forgot the feeling was there."
depression,fbhcqeo,t1_fbhbtvq,1576870575.0,And I notice that I self-sabotage A LOT
depression,fbhcmr2,t1_fbhbtvq,1576870508.0,"No, I never really have any of those symptoms. Just some days, iâ€™m very happy. I can go days, weeks, or months being happy. And then something so small could happen & I start feeling down. And it goes on for weeks or months. I canâ€™t do anything. I start missing out on important things & itâ€™s hard for me to do things. Sometimes I feel so positive like i can do everything, like I can join school to become a doctor. And then sometimes i feel very down, iâ€™m so ugly, and I canâ€™t do anything. I canâ€™t have friends or be around people bc Iâ€™ll bring them down. But i notice that even when iâ€™m happy, I still feel empty inside. Very numb feeling & emotionally repressed."
