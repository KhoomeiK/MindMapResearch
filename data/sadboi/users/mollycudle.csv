And that started the snowball effect, i was a mess in a no time. The land lord kicked me out, but i managed to find a tiny room for rent in a dorm room 2 days later. It was a horrible place, many people and noise all the time, i went psychotic and planed to kill my dorm neighbor before he killed me, i was sure he showed me signs of killing me all the time, i was super paranoid. It was a dark period, but now i have my own apartment, i've been to rehab and I'm gonna start with work soon. The road to paradise start in hell.  x)"

It's just, i want to see how i am without medication, currently not going so well, but i cant stop thinking about if I'm not bipolar at all.
