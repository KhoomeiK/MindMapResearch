web_design,fpsafu6,t1_fps8q5k,1588870170.0,"You make a really good point actually which I admit I overlooked.

If OP reads this; Jonas does more of the actual 'coding' side of design rather than explicit design theory for web, though as CowboyBret above pointed out, correctly I might add, you can also absorb *some* of the design principles which Jonas lays out in the course.

BUT, if OP wants more design theory, colour theory, web etc etc I found the following books pretty helpful for a start (note: these aren't Udemy but if you're serious about web design, add these to your learning list in time!).

Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug

Refactoring UI by Steve Schoger

Affiliatemarketing,fngc3yq,t3_g1ipsh,1586927793.0,"Absolutely.

$2.50 is a small amount yes, but in scale could definitely be a nice little chunk of change for aff marketers. *Sell 10, that's $25, sell 100, that's $250.*

There are affiliate marketers in high-magnitude sales (1*$250+).

And there are affiliate marketers who like sales on scale (250 sales at $1 each).

I reckon you would attract many affiliate marketers with a $2.50 commision (which is essentially 27-28% commission)."
