depression,fqd11op,t1_foxy790,1589275932.0,"My god. it's like I'm reading about my own journey. Felt like I died at 17. Dropped out of uni to pick myself back up at 19. I'm 21 in three days and most days I am so much better. but this past week or two have been a shit show. Makes it feel like all the hard work is lost, or like I haven't had any successful moments on the past two years. Your words mean a lot. I'm really glad you're doing better"
overcomebingeeating,fkwlwdw,t1_fjk8amq,1584596676.0,I would love information about it!! Thank you so much. Kinda awful to say but I'm glad to know I'm not alone in this and so glad that you found a way to heal you relationship with food.
TrueOffMyChest,fj8b8tw,t3_fbs8wk,1583109345.0,"thinking of you and sending good energy your way. regardless of what kind of bullet you might have dodged, i'm sure this shit stings like hell. time cures all ails, fortunately and unfortunately. hang in there OP."
overcomebingeeating,fj7o185,t1_fj715x9,1583094502.0,"I can't thank you enough for sharing this, it helps me understand myself so much more. I was reading through the posts of others and found that I related to an extent, but I don't think my issue is as severe in the binging aspect. Knowing your journey shed a new light to me. I think my biggest issue of all is that I am just obsessed with thinking about food. Whether I'm binging or not, whether i'm over weight or not, I am constantly thinking about it and constantly feeling guilty for it. And I can relate to your pre-recovery brain in the sense that I know my obsession with food makes me feel less than. Like I will never be able to be in an intimate relationship with someone, as long as I look like this and eat like this. Anyway, I am so incredibly happy for you and your recovery. Would you be willing to share the 12 step program you went through?"
TrueOffMyChest,fj5t7ra,t3_fbmmm6,1583042278.0,Can't tell you what it feels like to see this when I feel it but am not allowed to voice it for one reason or another. I'm so sorry you're going through whatever you're going through. You're not alone
overcomebingeeating,fj5rsui,t1_fj5p3l2,1583040967.0,"Also, congratulations on your recovery! xx"
overcomebingeeating,fj5rrxp,t1_fj5p3l2,1583040944.0,"Thank you so much for reaching out. Usually I find that, if I recognize that I'm over eating in the moment, I can stop if I really really focus on the eating and talk myself off the ledge, so to speak. I have been successful in the past when following diets, but only for about 4 months at the very most. Once I reintroduce the foods that I was depriving myself of back into my body, I generally don't stop until my stomach hurts. I did keto about a year ago, and that seemed to really help me at the time. I felt great and motivated to keep going while I was doing it. But as soon as I got off, I gained all of the weight back and then some because I couldn't stop myself and often found that I didn't want to stop myself."
love,ey17fo1,t3_cutprd,1566691862.0,The worst that can happen is she says she doesnt feel the same. It's better than wondering.  Hope you can tell her soon. Good luck xx
