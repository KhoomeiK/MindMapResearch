CompanyOfHeroes,fmwacwn,t3_fxqkij,1586442837.0,"start with t1 if you dont use any conscript supporting doctrine. Any competent player will outsmart you when you go heavy on t2 and conscripts wont carry you far. You are best off with 4x penal (or 3x + sniper) with a scout car should you need it. Then go for healing and t2, or if you didnt manage to hold at least a half of the map, go for t2 straight. Then get an at gun. Don't upgrade penal with ptrs until the very late game; if you really need a snare, going for conscript squad for overall utility would be better, because noone will allow you to throw satchel at their tanks anyway. If you have any doc infantry, get it. No more than 2 units tho. Then go for t70. From now then you can make a second at if you want to field something bigger or go t4 and get a t34 and su85/second t34 (depends). One su is enough to keep any tank at bay. Dont use its sight, because its very vulnerable when in this state. Use flares, t70 recon, infantry sight range. 

of course its only my build order, but it is effective in like 90% of 1v1 and 2v2 games. (was both level 16, around top 150). Use your early advantage to push the enemy. Close the distance to every unit that isn't sturmpioneer or assault gren. If these attack you just order your penals to stop, they will win this engagement unless caught point blank. Or get a sniper and hide in cover at max range while your sniper does the job. Watch for countersnipes tho and have your conscripts with at grenade always near."
