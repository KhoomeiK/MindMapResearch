I over exaggerate things a lot as well as that, and no one is petty (even though some chick came and called me that and swore at me but meh) no one is ur rlly important!"
depression_help,eotthrv,t1_eoq507v,1558848398.0,"Thanks for the advice.

The social media thing isn't like Instagram or snapchat (I'm not allowed those when everyone else is, ugh) but it was still bad even though i wasn't mentioned DIRECTLY (is the first letter of my name enough?) the school has FINALLY dealt with it but the consequence (hour of afterschool detention from one of them and being on watch) is NOT good enough

Yh, I get the dangers, and thanks again."
