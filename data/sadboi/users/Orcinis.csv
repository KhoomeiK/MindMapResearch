BackyardOrchard,fpetll4,t3_gd0otk,1588554655.0,"Cut it out and start over with a new tree. 
Save yourself time and effort on what will probably be a mediocre tree at best. 

If you want to graft it, you need to buy certified clean bud wood for citrus grafting and would take a few years to come back if it takes. I recommend you buy new but get rid of the old tree completely first so you don’t spread disease."
AdobeIllustrator,fopesw7,t3_g8rnx1,1587959666.0,Looks like I found my new background :)
BackyardOrchard,fop5lix,t1_foorxux,1587953586.0,Good advice. I'll keep one per branch for this first season.
BackyardOrchard,fop5ge7,t1_fooradg,1587953495.0,Yeah I think i'm going to thin it to just one apple. That way it can heal and I still get to taste one of the new varieties.
BackyardOrchard,folo80l,t1_folly5m,1587866591.0,Same haha his BiteMe seedling just took and I’m super excited to try it over the next few years
BackyardOrchard,fogfpna,t1_fofzaco,1587751993.0,I've had mixed results with chip bud grafting. It definitely takes more technique then the other types of grafting.
BackyardOrchard,fodystl,t3_g6z77m,1587692701.0,Another solution is to graft them onto loquat rootstocks to get a dwarf tree.
BackyardOrchard,fodymoo,t1_fodwxwa,1587692606.0,I’ve done it and had success but there are also different stages of buds and there are likely dormant buds tucked under or behind the growing ones. Try some grafts with leaf and some where you pluck them off.
BackyardOrchard,fodwv3m,t1_fodwrfh,1587691651.0,"Is this a picture of the scion wood or the root stock?
Edit: also am I right in assuming it’s an Apple?"
BackyardOrchard,fodwntg,t1_fodky60,1587691539.0,Pluck those suckers off and give it a whack! Should be fine.
BackyardOrchard,fo79xe9,t1_fo6rpbd,1587574751.0,"Try a cleft graft but make sure to put your scion in at an angle. It’s hard to try to line up the cambium layers, but putting it in at a slight angle forces 2 points of contact with no effort. It doesn’t give you the prettiest result but it works 99% of the time."
BackyardOrchard,fo6s58l,t1_fo6rpbd,1587565678.0,Usually you can see results (At least swelling buds) within 2-3 weeks.
BackyardOrchard,fo6quk7,t1_fo6kuxe,1587564948.0,Cut like an 1/8” off the tip of some of your scions to see if they’re actually dead. If they’re green still then you may be able to give it another shot. Also how long has it been since you did the graft?
BackyardOrchard,fo4rw47,t1_fo3wpzv,1587510024.0,"Rad. If you’re hesitant I would watch a couple videos on YouTube to get the general idea. Suckers like that you can always prune. As well as dead, diseased or damaged branches."
BackyardOrchard,fo3w3yd,t3_g5eny9,1587493932.0,What does the rest of the tree look like? If the top is healthy cut these out.
BackyardOrchard,fo10g5u,t3_g50y38,1587423277.0,Where did you get this?? I need scions ASAP haha
BackyardOrchard,fnqec7z,t1_fnps7jb,1587162938.0,Great info. Between the tree dropping fruit and the squirrels I usually don't have to do much thinning.
BackyardOrchard,fnqe51m,t1_fnothm1,1587162826.0,I have a whole team of squirrels that do a great job of thinning the fruit every year so I usually leave everything. Between them and the tree naturally dropping them it turns out perfect every year
Horticulture,fn71ref,t1_fn6pdvb,1586711612.0,Perfect! I forgot to mention that they love sun as well so try the keep it in a sunny window when indoors
bipolar,fn5gyod,t3_fxmuy0,1586664595.0,Never alone :)
Horticulture,fn4gpub,t3_fzjlf7,1586641036.0,"Make sure that pot has holes in the bottom. Also top off the soil as to not see the roots anymore and feed it a little fertilizer. The soil looks really wet. Citrus are very sensitive to over watering so do your best not to over water. 

I’ve seen lemon trees that look much worse come back. Try these things out and you should be good!"
BackyardOrchard,fmr3qeg,t1_fmqd20m,1586313179.0,"So at the bottom of the shoot it is still connected to the root of the tree. When I remove them I usually grab it as close to the root as I can get and pull at a slight angle. The goal is to rip it out with at least some root still connected. Pot them up with some potting soil in a 3 gallon pot to get them established then graft away! Keep in mind, and I know I’m repeating myself, but these will be rootstock trees and don’t expect good fruit from these without grafting."
BackyardOrchard,fmqcxwa,t3_fwfwbq,1586297273.0,100% Yes! Be sure to graft onto them though. On there own you likely wont get good apples.

BackyardOrchard,fm2st2o,t3_fsmoeu,1585704602.0,Axe it. You’re looking for branches to be 12-18” apart and going off the trunk at around a 45 degree angle. Also would 100% recommend watching a tree pruning video on YouTube if you feel hesitant. Lots of great info out there. But definitely cut it!
BackyardOrchard,fm2rxiz,t1_fm2mqlg,1585704025.0,Looks super low even if it is above the graft. I’d prune that sucker off.
gardening,flsqb3s,t1_flsnsxf,1585448145.0,With trees that are evergreen you can usually get away with a lot in terms of time of year. I would just make sure there is new growth on the tree. Whatever time that is on your tree
gardening,flro5zn,t1_flr7vd6,1585424282.0,Best results for citrus I’ve had us using a Tbud graft and slip it under the bark. I also use parafilm to warm it which ensures it doesn’t dry out
BackyardOrchard,flpqyzt,t1_flpph19,1585366390.0,The plum graft will make plums that taste like plums. The branch is only supported by the peach tree.
BackyardOrchard,fllp6qc,t1_fllcpe9,1585264946.0,Ill have to try those out!
BackyardOrchard,flkx0r2,t1_flkl48n,1585249266.0,That’s awesome! I don’t have many cider apples. But I’ll probably add more next season. Any in particular you recommend?
BackyardOrchard,flk99zf,t1_flk55c3,1585236519.0,"Yes! Pick pearl, Katherine, pink parfait, grenadine, Wickson, waltana and lots of others. Where do you usually get your scion wood from? I’ve gotten some here locally and ordered some from Washington but I want to expand to some east coast and southern varieties next season."
BackyardOrchard,flk4t1s,t1_flk0bws,1585233928.0,I’m in California 9b. I got some of the scions from a local Apple breeder. Lots of them are specialty red flesh apples. There are thousands of amazing apples out there that taste amazing that people have never heard of. You just gotta look for them
BackyardOrchard,flk3uq9,t1_flk0jzb,1585233357.0,"The reason you use parafilm is for its ability to stretch and eventually with sun and wind, it just disintegrates. It’s a fantastic tool."
gardening,fljztt7,t1_fljqm4h,1585230816.0,Nice!! I did some work for an orchardist this spring and he taught me how to do it. It’s such a cool art and has been very exciting to watch these start to take! Beat of luck to your grafts!!
BackyardOrchard,fljzn8i,t1_fljbaqt,1585230693.0,You’re literally looking at proof that parafilm works fine for any type of graft haha :)
BackyardOrchard,flimv80,t1_flilpup,1585185963.0,You can graft pretty much anytime sap is flowing in the tree. The key to successful grafting is using dormant wood with buds that haven’t popped yet grafted onto trees in late winter/early spring just before the buds pop. There are tons of great resources on YouTube like Steven from Skillcult

gardening,flh7r51,t1_flh3u92,1585157638.0,Super weird! That’s the best when they heal up super clean. I find that whip grafts tend to turn out cleaner like that.
gardening,flh23c3,t1_flgzxlp,1585154660.0,"I like that graft but every once in a while, I’ll get one that heals super funky and swells up really big."
gardening,flgyygv,t1_flg7gan,1585152990.0,Agreed! That’s pretty good! Did you use the same type of graft for all of them?
gardening,flfm4ww,t1_flfk63m,1585110335.0,I’m in 9b. I got my scions from a local orchardist friend of mine. The oldest ones sat for about 2 weeks. No worries. Great questions! I haven’t tried either of those but I’ve heard you wanna make bigger grafts on avocado and make sure the tree you’re grafting onto is putting on new growth at the time of the graft. Good luck!!
gardening,flfdrma,t1_flfd2z2,1585104031.0,This was a cleft graft. There are about 8 other grafts on this tree and I tried everything from whip and tongue to bud and cleft grafts. They’ve all taken :D
gardening,flfcjiq,t1_flfbhdg,1585103169.0,Aww that’s super cool! It’s an amazing art everyone who has fruit trees should learn.
gardening,flfaqp2,t1_flf8ymi,1585101933.0,Thanks! :) it was actually pretty simple with the right tools. There are so many good videos on how to do it online. I’ll probably post an update when it grows bigger though!!
