No. This is not the same thing. A human being comes before a pet always. There are some reasons beyond our control that may lead to re-homing a pet, and quite frankly it’s none of your business. Some people may experience financial hardship, their children are allergic (it pisses me off when people say this isn’t an excuse. Your child is literally ALLERGIC.), they don’t have the space, etc. There are so many reasons why, and at least they are doing the *responsible* thing by re-homing rather then sending them to a shelter. Someone who had to re-home a pet should not and should never feel ashamed. 

To anyone who has had to do so, I am sorry. I’m sure it wasn’t an easy choice. Don’t feel ashamed. Life happens."

Growing up my feelings were always invalidated because, “you’re a kid how hard can your life be”. “You’re not depressed your a kid.” 

I was 15 when I told my mother I was depressed and having severe anxiety. She refused to get me help because I was a *kid*. As a result, I suffered for years. I’m 23, and still suffering. I’m not so much depressed anymore as I am anxious as all hell. My anxiety is so bad I can’t even have conversations with people. It’s so bad that I have anxiety about getting help to treat my anxiety.

I finished high school (with great thanks to my mothers support and help) and got a job. I took a year off, and just worked after high school. Then I went to college. I’m still currently in college (I’m 23 now). So now I’m working and in college, and so is my significant other whom I had my son with. We had a great system going and then I found out when I was 21 that I was pregnant yet again. Keep in mind, I am on birth control AND my SO used condoms. His swimmers must be strong because I still ended up pregnant someway somehow. I ended up losing my job because my morning sickness was so bad that I couldn’t get to work. My SO kept working and I moved my college classes to online. After I had my son, I went back to school on campus. I have been unemployed since I lost my job though. It’s been rough. I’ve tried getting a new job but I have yet to be hired. I have a part-time job that I work (someone in my family owns a business) but it’s just not enough to cover the bills. & now with coronavirus... now it’s even harder to find work. My SO is working overtime at amazon. 

I really hit rock bottom after I lost my job after getting pregnant the second time. I was at an all time low. My anxiety was through the roof, and I was depressed. Then after I had my son I had postpartum depression. It was really hard. I felt useless, and I felt like a terrible mom and girlfriend. I really hated myself at that time. It took a lot to get off my feet again. Now I am planning on starting my own business online while continuing school. It’s the best thing I can do right now during the COVID-19 issue. 

I have also sought out professional help. It’s good to have someone to talk to. My anxiety is a lot lower then it was. I still have good days and bad days, but it’s better now. I’m getting better. School is also going well. I am going for nursing (my end goal is to become a nurse practitioner) and I only have a few years left.

The best thing that you can do is surround yourself with supportive family and friends. Getting back up after hitting rock bottom is extremely hard. I tried my hardest to remain positive and focus on the road ahead and my goals. My boys are also my biggest motivation. I love them with all my heart, and they deserve the world, and I want to make sure they have an amazing life. Their father and I work our asses off so they can have it."

Plus she’s offering extra credit?!

You have it good right now."
sex,foltevd,t3_g7tx0o,1587870049.0,"My mom was always very open about sexual health, and I never felt uncomfortable talking to her if I had questions. I remember when I was like 11 and I had gotten my first period. My mom sat me down and we talked about reproductive health, and we had the sex talk. Any questions I had, she answered honestly and there was no judgment. When I was 16, I started having sex with a boyfriend that I had. Then we had talked about contraceptives, and she offered to put me on birth control. Once again, there was no judgment. It was just “okay if you’re having sex you need to be having safe sex.” I was put on birth control soon after. She also had condoms in a drawer in the bathroom to take if needed. She would honestly much rather provide us with these things then having her teenagers getting pregnant or catching an STI. 

I guess the main thing is honesty & no judgment. Make them know that they can come to you with any questions and there won’t be any judgment. I feel like a lot of kids are worried about bringing certain things to their parents attention for fear of judgment. My mom was always great about it and very open. I never felt uncomfortable bringing up issues or asking her questions. Teens have sex. You can’t stop it. If they want to do it, they will do it. The best thing that you can do is provide them with education and talk to them about sexual health. If your daughter starts asking questions and it seems like she may be having sex, talk to her about contraceptives. Offer them to her. Whatever you do don’t make her feel uncomfortable about it and don’t make her feel bad about it. You’d rather her be having safe sex then getting pregnant or an STI right? You could also take her for her first visit to the gynecologist. Her doctor would also be able to talk to her about safe sex and preventing pregnancy."
unpopularopinion,folrt33,t3_g801w3,1587868972.0,"Ugh this pisses me off. You apply for a job and it makes you upload a resume, and then makes you type everything in THATS ON THE RESUME ALREADY. It makes no sense! None! Why do I have to upload a resume if I will just have to re-type everything anyway? Then they make you take a stupid “personality” or a “what if” quiz. It’s annoying. 

I’ve actually went to apply for jobs before, and the second a quiz pops up I back out. I don’t have time for that. I like nice and easy. With the job I have now all I had to do was upload my resume, and put a phone number. I was contacted the next day and scheduled an interview. Boom got the job. Nice and simple. I’m a single mom, working full-time, and I’m continuing my education so I can reach a higher level in my career. I literally don’t have time for applications like that. 😂"

relationship_advice,fokyy6z,t1_fokyns8,1587851618.0,I do. I just figured it was the sports gambling he was doing. He’s had jobs before but they don’t last long because he eventually stops showing up.

relationship_advice,fokyep0,t1_foky4nk,1587851320.0,I have no idea. Maybe his parents? He used to gamble but with no sports going on right now he hasn’t been.

It really is a great phone. The battery life is amazing, the camera is amazing, and even the screen is really good despite a lot of people saying it’s too low quality. I have zero regrets upgrading. 

I did not get the pro because I really couldn’t justify paying the extra $300. The only difference would have been the screen and a extra camera. To me that was a stupid thing to spend an extra $300 on."
