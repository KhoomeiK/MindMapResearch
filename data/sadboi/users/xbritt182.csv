It's kind of like training a dog. At some point the crazy untrained dog pulling the leash the whole time your walking learns how to behave as you start to get better and begins walking beside you, and then if you're really lucky, and you work really hard and end up one of the success stories, your dog (the mental illness) actually starts walking behind you. I think in some capacity it's still always there, but you learn how to control it. 

some days the dog ends up beside me again, but overall, I've spent a couple of years now without the dog ever being the one to pull me. I hope you get to this place too <3"
mentalillness,fq3rmew,t1_fpupkdt,1589069390.0,I can relate to feeling lost after getting out of treatment. It's been almost 2 years for me since my last time in treatment and even now there are still times when I miss it's familiarity and safety. I was only in for 2 months. I can't imagine how hard it was for you after a year. I hope you are doing well ❤️
mentalillness,fq3oz3a,t3_gfk1kc,1589068589.0,"This made me tear up. It is so incredibly relatable. I am 3 months shy of being 2 years out from a suicide attempt and every time I feel sadness for more than I day I get scared. I have had so much success in these past 2 years  thanks to therapy and medication. I've done so well I have even been able to go ""graduate (as I call it)"" therapy and maintain a healthy life on medication alone (it also helps that I have an extremely supportive and understanding boyfriend who listens to me when I need to be heard) but with all this isolation, I see signs of my depression coming back (I forgot to mention I was diagnosed as bipolar 2 after the attempt). I love to bake but I haven't baked anything in weeks. The house is a mess. I stopped working out. And my appetite is shit. It's extremely worrisome but at the same time I feel this sick comfort knowing ""I've been here before"". I know in my gut I'm still ok, I can come out of this before it gets bad, but its still scary."
