No i am making a naturalistic argument for it which is possible look up thomisitc views on this.

 

<<If morality is ""objective"" and comes from a ""benevolent, omniscient, omnipotent god"" then we would expect to see perfect moral standards defined from the beginning.>>

&#x200B;

This is a naturalistic argument i am not trying to make arguments for a god their are different and it's very bloody complex.

 

<<If however morality is an evolutionary process; we would expect to see morality improve over time as we evolve and recognize the problems with our previous moral standards/behavior.<<

&#x200B;

 Disagree here the limits of how much 1 can be moral is dependent on ones evolved stage but it doesn't mean it changes.

&#x200B;

 

<<The bible very specifically endorses slavery, even in the ""new testament"" Jesus is said to have told servants to obey their masters; Throughout recorded history slavery was 'legal' and widely practiced and considered (by those in a position of power) to be a ""moral"" practice. However modern societies now mostly recognize slavery as immoral despite the bibles unambiguous declaration that it is allowed.>>

&#x200B;

Okay the bible is not a set in stone book it was never meant to be it followed from traditions of other ancient tales this was going through their heads this leaves room for this implication god never implied these to be good or bad it was just grey.

&#x200B;

 <<the ""old testament"" god is rather famously described as an 'angry' god, a 'vengeful' god; one that floods entire planets and destroys cities and turns terrified women into pillars of salt for the horrible crime of 'looking backwards' as she runs in terror from the massive explosions behind her. Lots of Christians try to pretend that this god 'doesn't count' because that's 'the old testament' but... uhm... it's the same guy, the one they say is perfect, omniscient, omnipotent, benevolent and some even say 'unchanging'. << 

&#x200B;

Those verses has context agaist them a this was talking about religions which condoned human sacrifice even ancient is-realities were said to believe in this cult that's why got is a vengeful god in those contexts.

&#x200B;

As for the flood myths but the context was a story that circulated in ancient middle east of the apkallu the bible did a reverse twist to the fables again remember the bible is a book drawing influence from legends in that area 1 cannot take a literal interpretation when even the influences didn't.

&#x200B;

 \>>There are prohibitions against murder in the ""Code of Hammurabi"" (dating back to at least 900 years before the earliest books of the bible) and the entire ten commandments looks nearly entirely plagiarized from the ""42 negative confessions"" from the Egyptian ""Book of the Dead"" which also clearly predates the alleged time of the ""exodus"" by at least 600 years.<< 

&#x200B;

Sure that's 1 culture what about the other ones ? and this was based of their traditions and human sacrifice in ancient isrealite and middle east is a fact confirmed by scholars the pagans the early Christians they all did this their are reasons why god got pissed.

In the classical sense of the word mechanistic purely reduce able down to code preset hand by a designer know i will call for a rationalistic prove cause not all proof is scientific their is mathmathical proofs as well or priori 
https://www.iep.utm.edu/lp-argue/#H1



Essentially lucas rendition of godels argument is in any formal system a machine for instance it can have truth statements that can be proven to be true A=A or some other axiom however within a machines formal system since all machines are run on code it has to be input in with certain truth claims that have to be rational.

Then following from this we can use godels therome that in any formal system their cannot be proof within the system but the answer can be expressed from the inside.

Not so much with humans as we can clearly see we can express godels therome a machine cannot.

1 in any formal mechanical system their are truth claims that can be either verified or not verified.

2 Robots can only express what is with a proof.

3 godels statement has no proof in that formal system system but can be expressed from the outside the system.


4 human minds can express godels therome but a machine cannot.

C1 humans are not machines.

<<And going on to also assume mind/body dualism without proving it first is also meaningless. The link certainly didn’t convince me.>>

It makes more sense though then what others are purposing dennel dennet denies free will and if your doing that then their is no choice meaning over your own senses.

 If their is no choice over your own senses what makes you think you are even living in a real world and not something like a matrix by the brain.

Cause this is literally the road 1 is leading down fuck computer matrixes you already have biological matrix.

You can't escape descartes demon by denying free will.

<<The sylogism you went on to make seemed to lack some crucial words or possibly a few premises. I don’t see how you got from what essentially read as “it seems subjectively that my theory is true, and I have a model I have yet to show is valid that might support this but is by no means the only (or in my oppinion the best explanation), therefore my model is correct.”>>

Well i did provide neuro plasticity plus the idea of brain rewiring which would make the most sense if the 2 were basically the same thing.

<<You assume I accept Descartes demon as a problem - even moreso why you think it is a problem that does not apply equally to your model. You also assume I have no better explanation of why neurologists treat the “mind” and the brain like different things. Are you also mystfied why we distinguish between software and hardware on your computer?>>

Descartes demon is a problem though how do you separate this if you cannot even trust your own senses and that everything you do is a illusion your lead back to the issue of a biological matrix.

Also as a i explained before human brains are not binary code mechanisms godels therome proves this if we were we should not be able to accept contradictions we are not similar binary systems.

As the mystification lets assume for  a sec we are machines the hard ware acts as a phyical access point the soft ware acts as the information carrier to do basic tasks.

The problem here is  you would have to put humans in a different category of machines purely by the fact that in a computer the hardware isn't information nor does it control jack shit acts as a access point.

Know you can have hacked bits of hardware that actually overtake the entire system and makes you think it's the real 1 a man in the middle.

So this just leads back to descartes demon even if we were machines were of a different kind.

In ours if we are unique machines the hardware seems to actually make decisions similar to software their are differences but they seem nearly identical.

>>Then you go on to say that the subconsciousness makes the choice without me being aware of it is an expression of free will. It seems to me that the opposite would be the case.<< 

There are more than 1 states of consciousness they behave as you but a panentheist form think of when jesus was on the earth he coudn't see all of his powers nor the experiences of the heavens he was limited to human form a avi.


Similarly it's still you but in a panenthiest sense the brain seems to be you but with all the knowledge.

  >>Assuming for a moment that your subconciousness doesn’t operate deterministically (which I think it must to some degree it must be). If you are not aware of making the choice then how is this different from using a die?<<

None of the experiments show this though i have yet to see it and identity theory seems to make the most sense.

But it's you making the decisions in a panenthiest sense it's an avatar that still has choice but the ultimate expression of you is more than a single part not to say the single parts don't matter they do they matter a lot but the small build up to a large

<< If you are not aware of making the choice then how is this different from using a die? Or a magic eight ball? Can you be said to be making a choice based on your free will if you are not aware of doing so? If so we must be using different definitions of what free will entails.>>

Again it's panentheism the bits still have choices and those choices affect the whole overall mechanism itself of the brain but the choices are not wholly separate from the brain the 1 affects the whole so where in this view is free will not allowed ?

>>And the fact that we can see the brain making the decision - doesn’t this show exactly that? That it IS in fact the brain and not some mind making the decision?<<

No cause we have seen 1 also rewire the other over and over again the brain just acts as the identity within it is contained all your decisions everthing like that and we have no proof something outside the brain dictates it's choices. 

<<That the distinction between the two is at most like the difference between the hardware and software on a computer.<<

Not even close i would perfer to call it the outside monitor and the outside keyboard a place to store hardware and then to load up the software.

 If you wanna compare machines here consciousness is the loaded software the subconscious is the hardware plus the physical parts the corpus collusum etc.

 These other parts are the hardware but these are different from at least classical machines in the sense that atleast from a differential perspective the human brain can handle contradictions robots cannot.

 This is not to say we cannot get to  a point where a machine gets free will but it is arrogant to say we can replicate what nature did in 10000 years and regulate that down to a life time cause that is absurdly arrogant to think that.

And why is it so hard to believe nature could make free will ? after all look at the wonders evolution has brought us the art of problem solving the art of civilization culture music all this happened rapidly so why couldn't we get free will if the conditions met it..


<<So asserting that I can choose what I eat seems again to be just assuming what you should be trying to prove. I am not claiming to know that I could not have made any other choice, but it does seem like the explanation that fits the evidence.<<

But you confused brain with hardware earlier when brain is more of the monitor and keyboard and other outer parts mouse key board.

 Even then though it's a shit comparison cause their is no implication something from the outside needs to control your action  when their is with robots or machines.

Humans seem to be more akin to self driven agents that don't need external control.

>>You have neither demonstrated or proven that it is not the case, but you do assert that you have and I am calling you on it.<< 

No quite on the contrary it's on the other side to disprove something when something is known to be a self evident truth you have yet to provide evidence.

>>I might have “chosen” it but I an not convince there was any free will in the choice.

Yeah and we agree i am a realist a substance monist but a realist i just don't think mind is reduceable down in the rigid materialist sense and that i think at a base level even reality is conscious or has units of consciousness.

Also note i have not read the full thing it is ridilously long that being said i think your missing by what i define as conscious.

I don't mean every bit of matter has human level animal level or any level worth even making a basic thought just that it has units of consciousness and i also a realist but i suggest the fundamental substrates of reality  is made up of smaller conscious bits or information that are akin to when molded together consciousness.

  <<Panpsychism turns this completely around so that consciousness is at the foundation of reality along with actual superposition such that some semi-aware “choices” are at the heart of everything that ever happens.>>

I think it depends on how panscyhist you are their are strong and weak panshyists the strong believes that matter is fully consciousness i am not going down that route my position is matter has  a unit of consciousness in it or at-least a measurable unit.

As for actual superposition such a thing could very much so exist in  a realist model you just take the aristolian view of metaphyics that things are in 2 states before it is finalized it's a potential going to a actual.

An something like a a rock being thrown is in a state of potential till it is thrown similarly this could exist in a realist model i am not advocating realism doesn't exist just not  a reductive materialst realism isn't synonymous with materialism.

For instance we can be a substance monist like myself but still be a realist.

The main idea of this is not idealism it's dualism but rather all reality has 1 substance and that the super normal not natural is a  phenomena of nature i am a weak panenthiest but i do accept some supernormal essences that are part of nature but are different than reductive materialism like the phenomena of consciousness itself.

 >>Roger Penrose and David Bohm each have their own version of this but the Penrose version is more popular. My last comment was in response to that one - the Hemmeret-Penrose Orch-Or theory of consciousness but there are several others based on intrinsic consciousness or the Penrose interpretation of quantum mechanics.<< 

 I thought bohmians were against panschyism  whatever irrelevant i tend to thinkk matter itself is not conscious but has units of it  which interact with the quantum system causing wave function collapse.

The particle is in a undetermined state until it is actualized by either it colliding with the slit or the parts around it.

 <<They posit that these miniature semi-conscious entities combine to form a greater consciousness in some way with Penrose suggesting this happens inside microtubules to avoid quantum decoherence but many of his assumptions have been tested and rejected by the majority of neuroscientists and psychologists as pseudoscience for sounding scientific but being unsupported speculation based on evidently false assumptions.

We can never know truly where it is though and this view doesn't add the more logical view that the particles themselves in some sense have units of consciousness  and that the interaction cancels out the superposition given by the actual interaction creating 1 path that is free on it's own.

>>An analogy of this is trying to track how fast a car is going or the path it recently traveled using a single still image or knowing that the car took a certain amount of time to get from point A to point B giving us the average speed and direction of travel though we didn’t witness the car anywhere along the path.<< 

Are you suggesting basically Bohemian mechanics ? that we just don't have the correct method yet and it is 100 percent deterministic ?

But even if this were the case wouldn't interaction change the outcome of the end result ? and if this is the case and the universe has  a wave function and is constantly interacting with the environment at what point does the end not be changed ?

<<Actual superposition would mean the car is at the origin point, the destination, and every point that it could be along any given path including paths that allow it to travel faster than the speed of light. We don’t find this with cars but the mathematical model is almost guaranteed to find the car in one of the potential locations anyway.>>

When i mean superposition i don't mean it is literally every where i make the case it is potential anywhere and that interaction with the quantum system changes the outcome and since matter has units of consciousness and we are part of matter itself and the universe has a wave function the universe is constantly changing itself or splitting off"

I guess time will tell and it is a falsifiable premise it does not carry the assumption of absolute space and since space is conneceted with time  absolute space time in the other case and relativity shows time is not a constant.

<<Actual superposition doesn’t occur on the macroscopic scale but it does make sense as a mathematical trick.>> 

Offcourse not cause it's a particle it's a quantum thing however if everything is made up of quantum parts it does interact with the measuring scale and in so doing collapsing the wave function.

 <<When you don’t know, pretend it’s in all possible states at the same time until you find it and can collapse the wave function to indicate your findings.>>

But if the thing collapsing the wave function only occurs after the finding then we need an explanation as to what collapses before hand my answer is interaction with the quantum system mixed in with a little bit of pan sychism the idea that matter at a fundamental has some consciousness plus Darwinian evolution  interacting with the system creates the final result"
DebateAnAtheist,f7mll15,t1_f7mgloi,1573866673.0,"> I’ve explained already that the wave function of quantum mechanics is based on the potential quantum states using what we know.

Yes but collapse occurs when when measurement occurs and by measurement i don't mean conscious measurement i mean a measuring device.

 However if a measuring device collapses the wave function (most likely scenario) i would say so cause of the contact with the measuring device itself and the outside environment  and like in the process of Darwinian evolution creates 1 particle rather than a wave.

Know if the universe itself has a larger wave function and it self collapsing and it is is continuously collapsing it is creating more copies of this place but different  possibilities.

This is also more parsimonious cause we are not  leaving the probablity field up to chance we give reasons most likely why it collapses this seems to make sense and rescues free will.

<<We can’t know both the position and momentum at the same time but we can narrow down the potential states through our measurements.>> 

Yes for small wave functions but were talking about the wave function of the universe such a thing could not be deterministic  and then when applied to the larger scale cause the wave trickles down it creates specefic actualization (where the particle will be) based on  Darwinian evolution  of some sorts.

Also pansychism would be a interesting view in all of this  i don't see why consciousness itself could't be at some level part of matter at a base fundamental part.

(note i have no evidence for pansyhism but it is a falsifiable position)


<<and our experiments show that quantum particles are waves - disturbance, fluctuations, vibrations in the fabric of space itself.>>

Again doesn't conflict with my view my view has 1 problem in that it is under the assumption that matter it self if conscious in some format but conscious in a quantifiable way not in the woo woo stance i mean in a measurable way.

Note consciousness does not imply free will free will is a evolved thing  but just putting this out their.

<<Bohemian mechanics is strange by suggesting invisible objects being propelled by the detected waves and other interpretations are strange for suggesting these waves change into objects when we look at them.>>

1 the universe has a wave function

2 That wave functions is collapsing  constantly.

3 if thier is a self collapsing wave function and collapse can only occur when measurement occurs and it only becomes determined when it is measured.
4 Then the measurement and or contact with the system creates a finalized result from a wave of potential.

I have a theory and  a model which solves the hard problem the substance monist model the idea is that mind and brain are the exact same thing their is no difference and that their is nothing that is controlling the brain.

Did you choose your brain ? well that's like saying did you create your own brain before you had a brain which is a logical contradiction.

What about the argument that your brain is controlled by the laws of phyiscs i would disagree it's controlled by it it's bound by it.

I am bound by gravity but i'm not controlled by gravity i can move my  hand up ward but i can't jump to the moon.

The other argument that since the laws of phyics are deterministic the entire universe has to be i have realized 1 certain flaw only the points affected are deterministic the rest is not.

If the points are determined to the end of begging the entire system is not deterministic.

I reject the premise you can prove that the future is absolutely determined and that you ever could as the 2 problems explained before.

How would you measure such a thing and how do we know where it is specifically going from.

<<This is also a more interesting model that still allows for free will.
These are, I suppose, ""empirically equivalent"" phenomena with a different semantics.

Semantics matter cause the arguments made on it can lead to major philosophical errors and can create the hard problem of consciousness what occurs  you either get out right denial of choice or you get this option as a immaterial separate thing which  only adds to the hard problem even further.

To undo the problem you can merge mind subconsious and brain as all 1 thing this gets rid of the issue of us not denying our own qualia the other thing is it lets us locate it.
