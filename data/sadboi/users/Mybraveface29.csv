latterdaysaints,epjppng,t1_epjp8sp,1559257304.0,"You're right, this discussion is deteriorating I'm obviously not wording things in a way that is being understood. We are obviously not going to agree (nor would I think we would since we have different beliefs)

&#x200B;

Thanks for the discussion anyway, hope you have a great evening."
latterdaysaints,epjnbzy,t1_epjixvy,1559256310.0,"> We agree that your experience in the church wasn't comprehensive 

I do not agree with this, I think I may have mispoke. What I am trying to understand now is how my family and other members of the church feel about these things. As you are probably aware, these conversations can be touchy and emotional on both ends and especially with family. So I just wanted to know some other views on it.

> Maybe you would be in still if you got a taste of this early on rather than only seeing it now. 

To the contrary, I think I would have been out a lot earlier had I  thought these views were considered acceptable. The cognitive dissonance would have been too much.

> Why? Why not just accept that you were given a limited subset of the possibilities? That's not hard. And on the ""these days"" thing - is it possible that these ideas existed back when you were in the church but that you just weren't aware of them? I'm going to go with yes. 

Why would I have dedicated my entire life to something if I knew there were a limited subset of the possibilities. No leader in the church has ever expressed that you can perceive different possibilities as far as living ""the gospel"". At least none that I am aware of.  I was taught(not just by parents but at church and in conference) to take everything the prophets said as scripture and they said in conference that God would never allow them to lead us astray so I feel that is confirming that. I am sure it was possible these ideas existed back when I was in the church and just not spoken about as much or available to me. The problem is that these ideas are not the ones taught on Sundays or from the pulpit so I would have had to go against what the prophets said to view things in a different light. I am sure many people do have these views and I am not saying they are wrong, I think they should believe as they want and practice their beliefs as they want. My issue is the official church stance on these things. They don't ask just belief questions in the temple interviews, they ask many and the church has never come out and said ""only some of these questions really matter"" Anyway, these are not the reasons for me not being a member, these are just things I am trying to understand so I can come from a better understanding when I have conversations with friends and family. I don't want to get heated on either end. I truly am just trying to understand the general belief in doctrines and how they're perceived as a whole church. 

Thanks for the discussion and I mean no disrespect in anything I say. My faith transition was extremely painful and I am trying to get to a better place with the people in my life still in the church."
latterdaysaints,epj78xz,t1_epj41gs,1559248918.0,"I understand what you mean but I was in the church for 29 years and the main reason I asked these questions is because the way I was specifically taught in the church and others have had different experiences so it's just hard for me to reconcile the church of my childhood,youth and Young adulthood with what I hear from many members these days. Sorry, I didn't mean at all that you were doing it wrong, I think your view makes sense and is great,I would never say your are being Mormon wrong, that'd be like someone saying I was exmormoning wrong. Sorry it came off like that! Thank you for the discussion!"
latterdaysaints,epj6wef,t1_epj4wq2,1559248679.0,"It's things that Brigham Young taught that have been denounced which then throws me down that whole rabbit hole of prophets not leading the church astray. The Adam being God teachings for example and the blood oath. Or polygamy, things that were considered doctorine at the time"
latterdaysaints,epj1jc8,t1_epj0djk,1559245742.0,"Your view is definitely interesting. It's hard for me to reconcile with my many years believing in the church. When I went to a temple interview and every question asked has to be answered the correct way or you cannot go to the temple which means you do not get the full exaltation with your family which is the point of it all right? So if someone says they don't wear their garments all the time, or they sometimes drink wine or that they don't support something that an apostle said so they can't support them or can't support a local leader or if they are involved in a group like pride that conflicts either the church...those are things that stop you from going unless you like, which I could not do. So what's the point of being a part of the church and doing all the extra things. Why don't people in that situation just read scriptures and pray and have a personal relationship with Christ and ignore all the extra parts of the church?"
latterdaysaints,epj0eev,t1_epiwl8n,1559245299.0,"Thanks, I appreciate your response and perspective. I think my mind comprehends it all a little different and it makes me do too many circular arguments in my head, but I really appreciate getting your insight on this"
latterdaysaints,epivdjp,t1_epictkk,1559243650.0,"Thank you again for sharing that with me, it was definitely helpful. I think what confuses me is how it says ""Prophets testify of Jesus Chris and  teach his **gospel**. They make known God's will and true character"" ""As we study the words of prophets, we can learn truth and received guidance""  ""We also sustain the counselors in the First Presidencry and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators""   


I would take that to mean that anything that is said by the prophet and his apostles in conference must be taken as scripture and they cannot mislead people. Yet things have been changed so many time (I don't mean recent policies, I mean actual doctrine that has been denounced). That is where I go around in circles and I can't understand if most members truly believe that whatever the ""Brethren"" says goes even if it does not match with the spiritual revelation they feel from their relationship to Jesus and the holy ghost."
latterdaysaints,epit4qj,t1_epigc11,1559242945.0,"Thank you for your reply. That is what I hear from a lot of people now, my issue with it is, what about all the other stuff. What about the temple stuff, what about everything taught by Joseph Smith. When most people bear their testimony at church they say they ""know"" Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the Book of Mormon is true and that this is the only true church. I don't understand how anyone can actually know what things they are really supposed to listen to. If someone has a good relationship with Christ but does not want to go to temple or can't go to the temple because they can't answer all of interview questions correctly, is that enough? And if it is... why have all the other stuff? I hope that made sense, sorry I was all over the place. I really appreciate the discussion. I'm truly trying to get to a better place with understanding my family and the way I believed even."
