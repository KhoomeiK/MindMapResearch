and yeah, i play videogames and spend half of my free time on reddit, which kinda makes me feel like shit. if you dont like people in your area there's chats on discord, reddit and all the other shit for people in that specific city your age. they can be hard to find, but once you do, here comes a social life.

hell, i have only had 4 good friends throughout elementary, and i went to 2 diffent schools. i still have no social life outside of school, and it doesn't help that my curfew is dusk, but at least there's something.

maybe you wanna chat on discord or reddit dm's or something?"
