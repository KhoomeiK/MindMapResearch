Anxiety,foqasf1,t3_g8v0l8,1587988692.0,"Yes, I‚Äôm so scared of being forced to go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù too early. I‚Äôm afraid of spending all this time in lockdown to come down with corona as soon as I‚Äôm forced to be around people again. I dread missing my family and house, too. I wish working from home could be the new normal."

death,fi7nhci,t3_f6revd,1582224673.0,My family and knowing how bad intense grief feels first hand. I don‚Äôt want to pass on any pain to them. And also a little bit out of sheer spite. There is quite a lot of pain involved in living but keeping on going is like giving a middle finger to that pain and sometimes that feels really good.
