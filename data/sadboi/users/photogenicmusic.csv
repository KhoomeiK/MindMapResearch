We also have begun hospice at home. It has seriously been a godsend. While my grandmother is 91 and frail and may not have long, the last stage can endure 2.5 years on average. Hospice can help that entire time and I highly recommend that route. Medicare pays for everything including an aide that comes twice a week to shower her (plus the shower attachments needed), we got a hospital bed for her so it’s easier to get her in and out. And all her depends, wipes, lotions, ensures, and more have been covered.

Ativan and other benzodiazepines can cause more confusion and agitation in the elderly, especially those with memory issues. These should be used as “emergency only” and never too often because they are highly addictive and can cause permanent damage if not weened off of them correctly. 

I myself have an SSRI and Xanax prescription for my PTSD and OCD and know how wonderful benzos can make an anxious person feel. However, medical marijuana has been an even bigger help for me, especially since I can go to a dispensary and get the exact thing I need. 

My grandmother has just entered the late stage and has rapidly declined the last week. She had an emergency Ativan prescription, but has just been prescribed Lexapro since the Ativan was making her more confused and even restless at night.

AskReddit,fply36o,t3_gdzb3i,1588721705.0,My only detention ever was in 6th grade. I had forgotten my gym clothes 3x in a marking period so the policy was detention. I was pretty distraught because I never had been in trouble at school before. The reason I forgot my clothes is because my mother suffers from borderline personality disorder and pretty much slept all the time on top of being incredibly irresponsible. So I woke up and got ready on my own every morning and honestly had to rush most mornings so I didn’t miss the bus. My Spanish teacher was in charge of detention that day and it also was after school study hall. She honestly thought I was there for study hall/homework because I was a straight A student that never got in trouble. It definitely didn’t make me like gym class anymore.

Hell, the other day I was thinking of what my SAT score was and I couldn’t remember! I was so proud of it at the time too. 

It’s also a little elitist to think this recording was that important because not everyone can afford to have a way to video tape/record. Now everyone has phones, true, but growing up only the rich families had videos of events like this.

mentalhealth,fnjdoe9,t3_g1q7tk,1586996874.0,"When learning about meditation through my psychologist (ptsd/ocd) she explained it like this:

When you haven’t used something, you basically lose it. So think about your brain, when you have a thought or an experience, the neurons literally go to pessimism/self-hatred/etc. The neurons don’t even realize they can go the other way anymore because they’re on autopilot and it’s fast and easy to just think the negative thoughts with the well-used paths. 

Say you’re in the woods, you see you can see the trail, it’s easy, you just follow it, but you want to find this beautiful waterfall everyone has talked about but you don’t know where to start. What if you get lost? What if there’s too much brush, or too many ticks? Is it going to rain? Well, you can just keep going the boring trail, you can go through the woods unprepared, or you can go through the woods prepared. To be prepared you need things like a friend who hikes a lot to help you out (your psychologist), a map (important techniques you’ve been given), and more. Once you get there a few times you don’t need those things anymore. There is even a path developing to the point that it’s as easy and automatic to take the hike to the waterfall as was the boring old path.

Right now you’re stuck on the first path and you are trying to get to this wonderful waterfall but the path hasn’t been developed yet. So yes, it’s going to be tough, but eventually it can become second-nature.

I hope they made sense and good luck with your therapy."

I work with and learn about lots of individuals with different disabilities. That being said, the person you talked to on the phone is a volunteer that doesn’t have the same education as me and while they have a bit of training, it’s a stressful time for everyone and I’m sure they’re emotionally and mentally drained.

As a woman, I have learned that men are dangerous. From a young age women experience misogyny and harassment. Unfortunately, we may have different reactions to men that seem angry. Maybe she herself has PTSD from an abusive boyfriend. They are allowed to feel uncomfortable and let someone else take over. Its also ok for you to ask for a male.

I think it is important to tell the person you are talking to about your mental health history. When I met a new kiddo for counseling or special education I look to see why they need help because that is going to change the way I interact with and plan the intervention. Without knowing you had Tourette’s this volunteer probably thought they were talking to someone who was depressed because they lost their job or something and was most likely taken aback by the word “cunt” as you did not let her know what to expect. 

I feel for you, not being able to control these tics, just like I am unable to control my reaction to certain triggers due to PTSD, but that doesn’t mean that everyone around me has to put their feelings on hold due to my mental health problem.

It was fun when other parents would come in and say “so my kid said something new last night...” and I knew exactly what it was. Most of them were understanding and while I couldn’t talk to parents about other kids they knew what kid was starting the trend."

Me: Let us do your shopping for you and take this hand sanitizer to church if you really must go.

Grandpa: No, God will take care of me, and if it’s my time then it’s my time.

Me: But God might have wanted me to give you this hand sanitizer!

He thought about it and is at least not going out 🤷‍♀️"

The roads are wide, smooth, around here and not a lot of traffic as well as a beautiful landscape so that’s an option for road bikes too. It’s past the Harley Davidson Center in Boalsburg, right after Scott’s Landscaping."

I help take care of my grandparents and it’s a struggle to get them to listen to doctors sometimes and they like more traditional methods. If you want to go a more traditional route a change in diet has been helpful for some and not for others, but it might be worth looking into. I personally haven’t committed to any diet but try to generally eat better but with financial stress it’s hard to cut out things like dairy or carbs completely because they are cheap and filling."

She had me at 18 and thinks that because she could do it with no money I can too. Well no, my grandparents paid for most, but she seems to forget that. She keeps bugging me, trying to give me breastfeeding advice, saying that when I do have a baby I’ll wish she was dead over my husband’s mother. It’s ridiculous. I think she just wants to experience that unconditional love that I no longer give her because I’m privy to her manipulation. I’m finishing grad school and my husband is going to start in the fall. We also take care of my gramma that has Alzheimer’s. Definitely not a good time for kids for us and I’m almost worried about how we’re going to deal with it when it does come and she’s being entitled."

She does not take any medication for HS and is pretty unhealthy in general (smoker, bad nutrition, etc.) which I think plays a role into her continuing to get them in some places. While recovery sucks, so does HS, and she was very happy to not have her armpits and breasts bothering her all the time."

They give you a ton, my husband and I usually eat it for three days and it’s way better than Uncle Chen’s. Fuji and Jade has awesome lunch specials too, like $6 entree with sides. Primanti Bro’s has specials, but their sandwiches are cheap and huge on their own as well. If The Corner Room has the Monday pasta special that’s all you can eat for $7 I think.

raisedbyborderlines,f82ddpx,t1_f8200wc,1574189030.0,"Thanks for everyone’s comments! Right now, NC isn’t an option. I try to appease my mother so that there is less drama and we live next to my grandparents (her parents) to help with my grandmother’s Alzheimer’s. We are waiting to have kids until my grandmother passes and then it will probably be an easier time to initiate NC, but at the moment we are in a good place of sending each other memes and not really interacting beyond that. I am her most prized possession and she has done such things like prostitution or shoplifting to ensure that I was fed and clothed when I was little. She has so many mental and physical health issues and is on disability. She will never be able to live completely independently because disability is a small amount of money and if there is a big purchase, my grandparents, or once they pass, my husband and I, cover those expenses. She is messy and I would not want my child at her place, but she could visit and watch our child for a few hours if we went on a date or something. But maybe my husband is right. But we will have to approach that when the time comes I guess. Thank you for all the advice!

Edit: We both work in education and I am almost finished with my masters in educational psychology. So we deal with kiddos who have tough home lives due to drug use, abuse, etc. I sometimes downplay my mom’s behavior, but then I hear about these families and realize that yeah, it wasn’t the best home. My grandparents filled in where they could and did more to raise me than her! I guess I just remember the good times and would love to have my child have a grandmother figure (MIL recently passed from cancer)."

She can make sure a baby doesn’t die for a few hours. My husband said she won’t be allowed alone with our future child ever. I don’t know what we’ll do when we have kids."
