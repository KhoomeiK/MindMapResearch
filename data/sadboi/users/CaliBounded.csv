Or when a guy says something ridiculous like, ""Well, it involves whipped cream, a mid-air acrobatics ribbon, and a tomato"" and the joke is that its probably some super impressive, acrobatic sex move... 


Like literally, all they can do is fuck you. Nothing else.


Your options are Missionary, doggy, cowgirl or a BJ. That's it. Maybe she can stick something in his ass to keep things spicy, but that's literally it.

There is 0 proof (in this post, at least) that she molested her children, but there *is* definitive proof that he murdered someone. His own children witnessed that. Our assumption has concrete proof. Doesn't anyone that murders someone say that they did it with good reasons?


As I and this other poster said, all we're commenting on is what we *do* know happened. And all I said in her behalf is that we do not know what actually happen. If you're just going to believe and justify someone dying from two paragraphs of a secondhand story, you're too easily swayed. I'm hesitant straight up say anyone deserves a punishment because I've spent a lot of time in courts because of my own molestation case (I was molested by a cousin) and assaults, and other issues my family has had.

I've seen plenty of comments in this thread where women are accusing men of sexual misconduct against their kids and the sub is getting all over it and talking about how much of bitches they are. This could literally be the same thing just reversed. The OP of this story didn't even weigh in on whether or not he thought it was true - he just objectively told the story. Literally the comments above ours are someone realizing their own bias towards stories where men do aggregious things to women from this thread, and it's upvoted a ton. 


I'm a woman and I've been molested as a child, and assaulted more than once as an adult. I'm not even saying this as someone who doesn't have experience with this, but this is why I'm against the Death Penalty. Unless there's literally footage/photos of someone molesting or hurting children, or concrete evidence(rape kits, a parent walking in on it, finding child porn on their person or in their home, etc.), I don't condone someone dying as punishment. If that person was innocent, then what? You just ended someone's life, something that cannot be undone. Someone with family, dreams, goals, etc. You can't take that back. Even if 399 people were guilty and one wasn't, it's still not worth it to kill those 399. All I know is that a woman was murdered and there was no proof to any claims of what she did. Until that proof arises, it's just murder.


AND he murdered her in front of his own kids??? I'm more inclined to believe he's mentally unhinged and in the wrong from that alone. My mother had to wait until she'd already reported my abuser to the police to tell my late uncle about it, because she knew he'd have killed him if she didn't (he dilefinitely wanted to - that man was a pacifist and wanted to buy a gun to kill him) and he would *never* have done that in front of me unless someone was literally molesting me in front of him."

LateStageCapitalism,fp3nvn8,t1_fp3mqzl,1588282628.0,"I do not blame you for that - I think that that's what people should do (hold onto hope, I mean). And I want to apologize in coming off as fatalistic - I've been told this before. It's not that I feel like our efforts to change things are futile. Besides, the person that fights technology and progression always loses - whether or not Amazon remains a facet of our socioeconomic ecosystem, I believe that we can still maintain our dignity as people and fight for/demand fair and just treatment.


I just feel that my views come off that way because I'm a realist - to me, facts, like the ones I mentioned earlier about Amazon having a bigger stake in the world market than most people realize isn't something that makes me feel hopeless. It makes me feel empowered because through me being made aware of that, it makes me feel like wool isn't and won't be able to be pulled over my eyes. The same thing with Coronavirus news: I read it every morning and don't really get the feeling of, ""Man, this is depressing, I need a break from this"" that many describe. This is because I've been through Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Ike, Gustav, and 3 years of homelessness. For me, having as *much* news and awareness as possible brings me comfort - when all of those disasters hit, I had a clearer idea of what I *can* do about a situation if I know as much as possible. I though that's just me - there isn't a wrong or right way to handle any of this stuff as long as everyone is staying home and being safe.


The only thing that makes me feel bleak is like I said earlier, media convincing everyone that social media activity alone is enough. It isn't. However, I see the value in maybe seeing people online reacting to something could push others to do something even bigger about an issue. 


Don't stop having hope. Ever."

LateStageCapitalism,fp3gn3i,t1_fp3f92h,1588278965.0,"I mean... I guess I see the point in terms of wanting to show all of these brave workers support - they're doing SO MUCH to keep society running. It's said that in economies and neighborhoods where people don't have access to food, violent and fatal crime shoots up by 80%.


I guess my issue is that I've worked on both ends of the spectrum (customer service turned developer) and I guess I don't like the half-assed-ness of this option. If people are going to ""protest"" Amazon by not purchasing from them, shouldnt they protest *everything* that AWS hosts? 10 million people no longer using Amazon is one thing, but everyone stopping to support all of these major services is the only way that unsubscribing from something could hurt Amazon, thereby enforcing change, but thats not scalable or practical because many of us *need* these services. I feel like a lot of ""internet protests"" do more to serve people feeling good about their choices rather than actually going out and making real change. Which, I guess there's no crime in making themselves feel better, but I do like being honest with myself. I'm sure many of them don't know about AWS and the enormous hold Amazon kind of has on the entire world, so I guess all of this talk of ""protesting"" angers me more because the average person isn't even educated on how deep their influence goes (not anyone's fault - if I was a doctor or a mechanic or an accountant or a teacher, I wouldn't have this information myself, most-likely) and that it won't really do much.


I'm angry at all of the ""e-protesting"" that goes on while real people go out and make change. I'm mad at the fact that we're all so coddled by wifi and privilege that no one is going to go out and riot like people did during the Civil Rights era, or really, truly fight like youth in Hong Kong. Just lots of ""Let's sign a petition and see if our overlords will finally pick us over profit!"" They won't. I don't like the false sense of the ability to change things just by writing on a message board that the media has convinced the average person that they have. Again, I'm not angry at individuals - I don't think this is the average person's fault. I don't even think, collectively, that this is the average person's fault. But its still very frustrating. I'd rather see people partake in real change. These essential workers are doing somethinf real, and hard, and scary by walking out."
LateStageCapitalism,fp3d951,t1_fp3cxpy,1588277290.0,"Of course. I understand that, but I'm saying that doing something like supporting policy changes that do that, or workers unionizing would probably be a bigger help to this than people quitting their Amazon accounts. Why not protest using every single site on this list, then? Because people won't, and it isn't scalable.


But doing something like unionizing will. This isn't even close to the first time that people have went on ""strike"" against Amazon by quitting their Prime accounts."
LateStageCapitalism,fp3ch4v,t1_fp3buzy,1588276906.0,"For some people, it's the only way they shop for various reasons (or at least a majority of how their shopping is done). I feel like people would just severely impede themselves by removing their access to movies, digital books, convenient delivery, etc. right now only to re-instate their accounts in two months when they need to buy something and feel guilty about it.


A better thing to do would be to make sure they get involved with the politics of their nation and do their best to bring awareness to/not elect officials that approve these enormous tax breaks and bailouts for companies like Amazon. Or to help workers unionize. I'm sure there are way more options, but ending their Prime account isn't it."
LateStageCapitalism,fp2s4mn,t3_gataz4,1588266975.0,"Don't want to be a Negative-Nancy here, but Amazon's website is something like 10% of the company's revenue. The vast majority of it comes from a service called **AWS**, or **Amazon Web Services**. To keep it super short and non-technical, many of the biggest websites on the internet pay Amazon to host their websites/apps online. 


The following are some (only *some*) of Amazon's large, popular customers:


- Reddit (Pikachu face) 
- Netflix
- Twitter
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Pinterest
- Dow Jones
- HTC
- Adobe
- ESPN
- Nokia
- Imgur

And many, many, *many* more. I'm not saying not to protest Amazon - I think Jeff Bezos is the AntiChrist. But I *am* saying that canceling your Prime or Amazon accounts does almost nothing. Amazon has unfortunately embedded themselves so much in modern society that I imagine we'd all have a problem if Amazon.com's marketplace would go down. I'm sure there are other ways to protest, but this isn't it. If anything, Bezos will find something else to replace the revenue lost from Amazon quickly, and it'll probably be some way to profit off of this virus."

My job was great before COVID, but now I'm being severely overworked because my boss fired someone with an extremely important job very suddenly two months before lockdown started. I had to absorb her job. I was supposed to get a raise and promotion a month ago because I was doing so well, but COVID hit.


I would roll with the punches and just be happy to have a job, but my boss is now micromanaging because we're not in the same office physically anymore. I feel both overworked, emotionally wrecked (due in part To COVID and the fact that I've been pigeonholed into customer service work) and frustrated that I'm being micromanaged. Our company is super small (only 6 people) and I feel like my boss isn't communicating like he should. He'll tell me to do one thing, and when I do it, he seems surprised that I didn't just *know* to do something else. I get that his company is in danger (like all small businesses), and that this is a stressful time for everyone, but he's being short with me, and I'm not getting paid enough to have someone breathing over my shoulder, dealing with shitty customers, etc.


I'm having a talk with him about all of this Monday . If we can't reach a good place on this, I really am prepared to quit within the next three months, but like you, part of me just wants him to cut me so I can collect unemployment and study instead. I was supposed to be promoted to a front end dev officially since I've bee doing some development work for the company already. I could seriously be making more money elsewhere."

internetparents,fonai37,t1_fomf7cd,1587915685.0,"This is not true, and I highly advise you stop giving this kind of advice. 


My own mother physically abused me for 8 years. She did not ""change"". She became more abusive when I left her home, in fact. Some parents legitimately will never love their children as they are. Sometimes ""fighting love with love"" just puts you more in the line of fire for abuse. Plus, OP just said they were suicidal literally yesterday. When you're suicidal, you struggle giving even the bare minimum to yourself, let alone the people that push you to being suicidal in the first place(and they don't *deserve* OP's effort) . OP owes nothing to them and should *only* focus on their mental health. Why is it the responsibility of the abused person to give *even more*? Despite what Disney tells you, love doesn't cure/fix negative people. Their personal decision to change does, and that isn't guaranteed. 


The good news for you, u/pony-boi, is that you can find chosen family, self-love, and coping mechanisms to deal with temporarily having tp be around them. But people are set up for failure when their recovery from abuse or how much they love themselves is directly linked to how much other people love them. Focus *all* of your energy on getting through this. r/raisedbynarcissists is a FANTASTIC community for this, and they are very supportive. Engage with your physical parents only when it is absolutely necessary.
