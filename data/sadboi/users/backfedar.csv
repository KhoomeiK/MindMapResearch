Okay, fair point. But still, something needs to be done about these troll posts.

> When there’s no rule broken, that would go against everything that InAction subs stand for.

My main point (which you agreed with) is that the fact that these posts don’t violate any rules is a problem in itself (and some of these posts probably do break Rule 1). Looking at the three moderators' account history, they have been gone for a long time, which has allowed this sub to become a place for trolls to do their thing without any repercussions."

I see what you’re saying with the whole “ignore the trolls” thing, but the problem here is these troll posts pretty much dominate all content on this sub. At this point, wouldn’t it make more sense to actually block those posts and users instead of just letting them post all that crap while the content that is actually relative to the sub’s purpose fades off into obscurity?"
