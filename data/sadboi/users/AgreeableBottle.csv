If you’re lucky medication might help you or therapy might. For me personally medication (and weed) have been quite helpful, therapy not so much. It’s going to be a hell of a ride, but sometimes it can be advantageous too, you might have a better way of understanding people around you or paying attentions to details, bpd people are said to be quite good in bed and passionate lovers, don’t think that’s true for everyone tho.

Maybe do some research online on the alternatives and if there are some and your mothers doctor still insists on her taking that specific one, maybe consider changing to another doctor.
