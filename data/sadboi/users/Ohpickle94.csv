Been self harming for over 10 years.

I remember I did I really deep one on my leg and the MH lady was like ‘well it’d be different if that was on your arm’ and I’ve made many of those... so much so that the ER drs had to check if my tendons were still working in my thumb.... and then they sent me home no questions asked.. I don’t understand. I’m honestly so sick and tired of trying not to self harm.. and my main goal is to make it so it maximises damage to me and to ha e the treating team turn a blind eye to me makes me feel like I’m not valid enough.

Let’s fix this with collagen’ (that’s normal) then my body after the wound has healed is like ‘OMG MORE COLLAGEN’ so now I have these big raised red scars on my arms, they can be painful and itchy. It’s just how my body (my arms anyway) respond to scarring. It takes longer for them to fade and become flatter.. (like 3 years instead of like 1 year) the gross thing is.. you can see inside the keloid scar that it has blood vessels in it. They’re just so gross.... 
then there are hypertrophic scars which aren’t AS bad.... here’s a good overview on both: https://www.dynamed.com/condition/keloid-and-hypertrophic-scar

This year it’s been twice..... 
I’m guessing you’re in the US? Well aus is super chill with mental health apparently because of funding within the government. It’s so hard to get proper help with government help... otherwise it’s a hefty price for private health. I remember when I was 16 and cut really really deep into my arm, I was left In the waiting room for hours and hours. I fell asleep in my mums arms with a bandage that went crusty and stuck to my wound (even after being brought in via ambulance) they gave me 2 paracetamol for the pain lol. So my dad has to pick us up in the morning and went to another hospital where we still waited for a couple of hours. Finally, an old cranky dr came out and basically lectured me and wasn’t sympathetic with the local anesthetic that he jabbed several times right into the centre of the wound I remember crying so much mum even cried a bit. Then he was just like ‘k cya, don’t do it again’

Then the local healthcare team sent me to a counsellor who told me that I self harmed for attention and I need to stop it... then got my parents in and lectured them about being bad parents and that they should let me out late at night to galavant around and do whatever I please.... hahahahah like wtf. 
Anyway kinda changed since then but still not the best... like every psych every dr that came into my presence this time round they kept asking why I was here like..... what.... read your notes people!!! The ambos had to inject me with something to stop my heart going dangerously low apparently (adrenaline possibly) . 
Anywho. It’s in shambles.
I’m ok... my mind is scrambled from eating 30+ seroquil. The nurses didn’t give me any form of meds while I was there not even my usual desvenlafaxine.... I basically lost my job and I have exams in a couple of days that I do not want to fail..... one of them being anatomy lol. So yeah thats where I’m at.

On the hospitalisation stuff you mentioned before .... I literally got sent to the ED the other day for an overdose in intention of suicide.... (stupid I know) but after 3 days.. I got the ok from toxicology and the psych came up to me and was like ‘why you here lol’ and they discharged me straight away only because I recently have moved back home... so I’m in Australia and this has happened to me three times now.. and they always ask if I want to go into the psych ward.. it’s never involuntary.
