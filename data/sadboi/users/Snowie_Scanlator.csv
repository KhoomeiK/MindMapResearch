I know it is just an image, but yes in most case scenario of similar circumstances I would fight to stay alive but mostly because I don't want any more pain, any suffering of the sort and drowning for example is absolutely terrifying, not because of the result, but the process itself.

helpmecope,fp6ch5h,t3_gbbka2,1588349965.0,"Ok. So, first of all, she might want to go to a psychiatrist/psychologist, that would probably be her best chance to recover. Keep in mind that finding the right therapist for you can be hard and it might take a while, but don't give up. Help her make appointment if she needs it. Secondly, trauma is very tricky to deal with. Each victim has different ways to cope and your girlfriend seem a bit lost at how she wants to deal with her own demons. She seem to be out of control. Being fairly active in the BDSM community for... More than 10y now, I can say that there is quite the amount of people that has been abused physically, verbally, or even raped that... Copes by sort of recreating (in a consensual, controlled way) their situation. Example : someone that has been verbally abused by his parents will be into humiliation and verbal degradation. It is not a rule, there is a lot of different people that react differently, just an example I have encountered. Same for some rape victims that are into rape play. Well,  my theory is that it is a way to face your fear and to sort of telling yourself your better than that and that they don't control you, you do. I don't really know. But it might be the case for your gf. She might need someone to put a bit of order around her. Talk with her. Try to make her express what she needs, what might makes her feel better, and if you're both wiling to try BDSM, I would suggest going to r/BDSMadvice beforehand. 

But mostly she needs therapy."

My current cat is obsessed with the outdoor, birds drive him nuts, it's the most active cat I've ever had, nearly never sleeps except from 23pm to 6am were he is basically comatose (he sleeps with me), he likes to go on walk with me, he come to me, chirp and wait for me to follow him, and we can walk for hours (without leash ofc) it's the first cat that ever did that. Sometimes he run forward but he will always either come back or wait for me. Sometimes he even looks annoyed because I'm not fast enough. And I've also had a very lazy cats that didn't like the outdoor that much, weren't interested in flying things, all he wanted was sleep, eat and pets. But didn't liked to be picked up, at all.

Also, don't track your weight loss solely on the scale, measure and photos are super helpful to see progress. 

And you know weight loss is never a perfect down curve, you often hit plateau that slows you down or discourage you, I totally understand that. But don't give up, it is worth it. And I am with you in this, I already lost quite a bit but I have still plenty weight left to shed."

No travel time morning and night, no annoying colleagues, no noise, no closed curtain because ""damn natural light is so aggressive I'm a vampire and sun will kill me"" thing. I can have as much light as the weather allows me. No air conditioning that gives me headaches at best or makes me sick, no pressure from others, no small talk, and the most freeing thing is I don't have to do ""la bise"" (I'm french) and that is one of the best thing I've been freed of since the pandemic. And I am very sorry for all the people who are sick, for all the health workers etc but I don't think enjoying the lock down means I am selfish. It's a bit about seeing the bright side in all of this. Because it is not all sunshine and flowers for me either."
badwomensanatomy,focgteh,t1_focfntt,1587671163.0,"I have indeed lot of anxiety issues and probably even depression (not diagnosed though) so it surely doesn't help... And yes not being able to orgasm makes me anxious about it and makes it even harder. It's a vicious circle. I'm trying to figure things out with therapy though so there is that. But yes, maybe I must persevere to try. :) Thank you for the talk, it kinda made me feel better about all of this."
badwomensanatomy,foce45f,t1_fobyk92,1587670246.0,"Yeah we tried but it didn't work very well... It was either in the way or the vibrations were too strong for my SO and it did not feel good for him, I have yet to find a toy that would work for the both of us."
badwomensanatomy,fobfihr,t1_fobbwbl,1587659265.0,"The problem is, I don't really know myself what to do either, so how can I guide my partner ? I don't like oral, it tickles more than anything. And
 has I said I can't even do good myself through masturbation unless it's with a vibrator that does the job for me basically... I've tried with finger and other non vibrating dildos but it I can't."
badwomensanatomy,foaw7uc,t1_fo9kaa2,1587653345.0,"I'm pierced too... But I have a *lot* of trouble orgasming, like I can only achieve through masturbation, not all the time, I've never got far with just using my hands, I've been orgasm-less for about 23yo when I had my very first (when I bought my first vibrator). And still nowadays I can't get anywhere without my toy... Which is incredibly sad but what can I do honestly ? I never had orgasm while having sex. I want to but I don't know what to do. I've tried lots of things. And it makes me really sad actually and kinda depressed. Sorry for the rent."
badwomensanatomy,foaup3o,t1_fo85apj,1587652787.0,"Yeah no, fuck that shit I can't even cum with proper stimulation 6 times out of 10, so about ""mind control"" clit uh... Lucky are those who actually can it that's not bs. But I'm pretty sure it's not ""plenty"". I know a lot of women that have my issues as well."

helpmecope,foaetqz,t3_g6jvdk,1587645476.0,"You might consider wanting to get help from child protective services or something like that. Maybe giving them a call could help you in the right direction for starters. I have no other suggestions, sorry..."
BDSMAdvice,fo9t8it,t3_g5yy1x,1587630342.0,I'm sorry OP but that is straight up abuse. And you know it yourself you're even saying you can't go through that again. And you should not. Ditch that abusive creep and never turn back. Block him everywhere and never have contact with him again.
lingling40hrs,fo6tiuk,t1_fo6szil,1587566444.0,"That is awesome !! You're so freaking talented :') Japanese is also my third language eheh. Honestly you should pursuit what you're doing, I'm sure you can become excellent and make a living out of this. 頑張ってください。このビデオはすごかったです!"
lingling40hrs,fo6smtg,t3_g5x9f2,1587565950.0,"Uuuuh... It's absolutely fantastic !!! What an awesome job you did. Are you working in the field ? Did you get help for the Japanese or in top of all your amazing talent you also speak Japanese ? (Or maybe you ARE Japanese, that would work too). 
Anyway WELL DONE !!! I love it."
JUSTNOMIL,fo6h96e,t3_g5tcqd,1587558742.0,"Yeah well if my SO even suggested getting rid of my cat I would have kicked him out on the spot and let him marinate outside so he could think a little about that. I totally understand you about the pregnancy, it is not because you are to bring a new life that you have to get rid of another. That would be incredibly wrong... Your kitty and yourself are stressed out by that situation, and does your SO thinks it's a good idea for your and your baby overall health to get rid of your precious cat. You would be devastated, and stressed even more how that would not impact the baby negatively smh..."
FondantHate,fo6gbdr,t3_g5wxgi,1587557999.0,It looks very pretty and well done ! So bad it's not edible.
BDSMAdvice,fo63wt2,t1_fo4ginf,1587545560.0,"I tried to upvote your comment so many time in the process of reading it that the arrow flashed... 

On a more serious note, your wording is true and well put. I could not have said this before*. I hope OP will see it. Too many subs are being abused in the cover of BDSM. I cannot stress enough how bad this story scream abuse and rape. So many red flags.

Edit : *better"
BDSMAdvice,fo63ibf,t3_g5min6,1587545129.0,"I am very sorry OP but in my book that's called rape... You said stop, he understood and chose not to stop. This was non consensual and he *knew* it. Him telling you he thought you could handle it is gaslighting. He lied to you. I know you think you know him, and that he is not abusive etc. But... Please, please, consider the fact that a lot of time abuse does not come just like that. Sometimes it take years before it really starts. I've heard and read plenty of testimony of women that ha been abused by their husbands. The other way around exists too of course. Abusers are not gender locked. Abuses escalates a lot, it starts with often non very significant things, moods, white lie, guilt trips, forgetting an event, over apologizing is also very common. Like saying it won't happen again, it was a mistake etc. Yeah no that was not a mistake that was a conscious choice. He will try to make you feel bad for him, but you know safewords must be absolute right ? A safeword is NOT questionable. The Dom does NOT chose wether the safeword was justified or not, that is not Dom it's abuse. OP this is a very serious issue, do not dismiss it and make excuses for him, and please consider your safety before it's too late."
ZeroWaste,fo3jg6k,t3_g5ije5,1587487918.0,It looks awesome actually ! Very cosy.
BDSMAdvice,fo2opnh,t3_g50pba,1587469927.0,"Hum... If urine coming out while performing blowjob is what worrying you, I think you can ease up as it almost never happens, and also your partner would most likely be able to warn you and avoid peeing in your mouth if it were to happen. I've never heard of unintentional blowjob peeing actually so I think you're safe. If it's generally because pee come out of here and therefore it is dirty, you can clean just clean it up just before and it will not smell or taste of pee !"
unpopularopinion,fo2bh5r,t3_g536nx,1587456119.0,"As much as I agree with you I don't know anyone that is like that. Maybe it's a cultural thing ? Because here in my country I've never seen or very rarely big fancy rings, no big shiny diamonds and such. It's always quite simple and discreet. I'm engaged as well and we went to chose a ring together and it didn't cost more than 100€. To me it's already a lot to spend on a ring. Same about wedding, I don't see myself spending a lot, I just want close friends and family, good food, beer and that's it ! I'd rather put my money on something else, like a trip in a cool country, a house..."
