ADHD,euqr4vt,t3_ch1fkb,1563983952.0,"I agree it is misleading. I don't even tell anyone I have ADHD anymore unless I know they fully understand what it is. I will tell other people I have a learning disability. People accept that as something you cannot change, whereas ADHD comes with the connotation of ""well they could change if they wanted."" 

The truth is it is a disorder in the brain. There is nothing you can do on your own to change it. No amount of ""correct thinking"" will change the fact that your brain does not work the same as people without ADHD. There is no scientific evidence that anything other than medication corrects the issue in the brain. You can go to therapy, take vitamins, exercise, and all of these things will most likely help, but they won't fix the issue in the brain. It is like someone with type 1 diabetes. You can't will your body to create insulin anymore than someone with ADHD can will themselves to improve their executive functions. 

Check out Dr. Russell Barkley. He is the only one that I know of in the industry that focuses entirely on peer-reviewed scientific data. Maybe some people respond well to the whole ""ADHD is a gift"" nonsense but I prefer hard facts and data."
ADHD,euqp8vy,t3_ch50vl,1563982937.0,"What you're describing is really similar to how I felt when I was in school and lived with my parents. I'm 29 now. It does get better. 

Programming is a great option. I assume you are in the UK, so I'm not sure what the education structure is, but in the US we have technical colleges that offer mostly practical courses that will actually apply to a job/career. That sounds like it would make sense for you, since I think it's silly to have to learn so many things you won't need later in life (unless you really enjoy it).

My mom was (and still is) really similar to yours. I pushed myself so hard in school just to measure up to my brother, who didn't have ADHD and was better at science and math. We have something called AP classes in the US and I took 4 of them my junior year and was just so burnt out. If I ever talked to my parents about dropping a class they would get furious with me, call me lazy and all that. I even tried talking to my guidance counselor about it and she just said I should try to ""focus and participate more."" Gee, thanks!

It's so hard growing up with ADHD and it is still hard having it as an adult, but some of the pressure is off once you start making decisions for yourself. It's hard to do that with helicopter parents who think they know better. 

Good luck with everything. Focus on that programming. Ease up on some of the other things if you can. Once you are free from some of the stress I bet it will be much, much easier to work on programming. Figure out how you learn best, and where. If you experience a lot of stress at home, I'd try to spend more time at a computer lab or in a library alone, try to meet others who are into coding, etc. Just get out of the toxic home environment so you can focus on your strengths!"

relationship_advice,etffekb,t1_ete5706,1562768406.0,"To give him the benefit of the doubt, he could have mental issues. Has he been dealing with excessive stress lately? Has he been diagnosed with any mental health issues in the past? Change in medications? I say this because I come from a family of extremist views and we also happen to be bipolar alcoholics that get crazier with age. We have anarchists who believe the government is hiding a universal energy source from the masses, and those who believe Trump is some kind of modern Greek hero who is a mastermind dismantling the current political system where Jews are somehow involved and anyone brown/black and Irish (?) are dangerous. 

&#x200B;

So, I've had a lot of experience dealing with people and extremist views. What I can tell you is that (generally) men will externalize their problems - i.e. I can't be happy because women ruined the country. Women tend to internalize and end up with a lot of anxiety and depression. But it's just two sides of the same coin and I think the suffering is the same. So, considering you've been with your boyfriend for 5 years and you clearly love him, I would take some time to figure out why he started feeling this way in the most empathetic way possible. Don't get angry, take breaks from the conversation if you need to. Hear him out, and then make a decision to leave or not. That's just my suggestion. You could just leave him, it's all up to you to decide. 

&#x200B;

Good luck, I hope your boyfriend can really think about the issue and figure out where it's coming from. If he spends a lot of time online it is likely he is immersing himself in online communities where he feels accepted, and if he's a white man unfortunately there are a lot of toxic places."

The medication I take now? Life changes? I have no idea. At one point it got so bad I lost 20 pounds because I couldn't eat. Everything made me feel sick. A bowl of rice left me with excruciating stomach pain. But doctors said I was overreacting or just told me to try omeprazole. Thankfully it hasn't gotten that bad again. 

I also have a lot of fatigue. Everyone called me lazy. I could sleep for 14 hours too, and still be tired. In high school and college I would go to school, come home and sleep, wake up for a bit and do homework, then go to sleep again. I wonder about the hypothyroidism. That's a blood test to diagnose, right? I have had tests before and a pretty extensive testing process for my life insurance, and nothing like that was ever found. But, maybe my ADHD/bipolar disorder explain it. 

Trouble for me was my bipolar depression was there along with my ADHD. My worst symptoms were the depression. But anti-depressants never did a thing except the wellbutrin.

But then I realized like...wow. They're supportive of him no matter what. They don't withhold affection. And he was awesome as a store manager, too. He was so caring about his employees and worked so hard despite all the crap that goes along with retail. And that job led into his current job as the director of a nonprofit. I'm so proud of him.

They didn't want me to be a baby or be ""weak"". So I just channeled everything into anger. My brother would often abuse me and punch me and call me names and my parents did nothing. 

Anyway it's honestly been a struggle to not get angry, I get very impatient. Although at work I will suppress my anger and that generally leads to crying. So, I think you're onto something that being socialized as a woman makes you funnel that into crying or avoidance and not outright anger."
bipolar,eq0rnlv,t1_epzqkab,1559692468.0,"Oh man, I bought a freakin' car for a guy after like 2 months of knowing him. He said he'd make the payments lol. He wasn't a d-bag or anything. He was probably worse off than I am mentally. Idk what I was thinking. Years before that I married someone who was either bipolar themselves or had some other issue, we got married in a courthouse and I remember his mom cried (tears of sadness lol) when he told her. It was almost like a dare for the both of us...like oh bet you won't marry me because I'll make your life effin miserable. It's funny because every time I make terrible decisions a part of me KNOWS it's not the right decision. So I'm feeling this excitement/hypomania and want my self-aware self to just shut up, ""live a little,"" and that one part of me is like ""you're gonna regret this later."" 

Honestly it is so, so relieving to hear that you have had similar experiences. I always thought I was just...like flawed morally or something."
bipolar,epzo01n,t1_epyv5qj,1559669354.0,"Thank you, I appreciate you telling me your story. I think I’ve always hid things out of fear of being hospitalized. Plus, it was easy for me to forget that the day before I was a sobbing mess talking about how I have no feelings for anything. Although my boyfriend has found out that I will still get up to look at a dog outside lol, so even in my depressed state I wanna see dogs. 

I’m really bad at over reacting too. I will usually overanalyze and try to find the ulterior motive in everything. My boyfriend is really supportive and works for a non profit and in my bad states I will accuse him of just dating me being I’m mentally ill and he fills some weird need by taking care of me, and therefore doesn’t love me. Oh man I have theories in my brain lol. The one thing I have noticed is that if I talk it out I see how ridiculous it is and that it’s not my fault I thought it, I can go thru and logically say ok this is silly. Or worst case I go to sleep until it’s sunny and I feel better.

Thank you again. I really appreciate the support and I’m happy to know it gets better after diagnosis."
bipolar,epzn9e2,t1_epyv0z2,1559668950.0,"That’s a good point about how bipolar is portrayed in the media. I really had no idea my “highs” were a problem until recently and I just felt out of control. It’s like I’m split into three selves, my depressed, suicidal self, my hyper self with no self control, and then just me in the middle. I never really know what’s going on in my brain. I just kept thinking well the depression will get better.

No one in my family has been diagnosed but they’re all alcoholics, drug addicts, agoraphobic, paranoid, etc etc. my mom even said to me I just need to “accept myself for who I am” and she puts up with my dad’s bullshit and temper tantrums as if it’s just “who he is.” My family thinks any attempts at self improvement are just going against your true nature. It’s nuts."
bipolar,epx3sxc,t1_epx31xw,1559591360.0,"I'm not sure how to even have a healthy sexual relationship. I have been with my current partner for about 2 years and he has been incredibly supportive. I just don't know how to create a healthy sex life. I get terrified that if I become sexual again that I will get crazy. I cheated on my last partner with a married guy at work. It's frustrating because the high I got from sleeping around with someone married, and taking a lot of risks, pushed me to get healthy (I was running daily) and I was great at my job, I had loads of energy and enthusiasm.

The problem is, I have had people suggest polyamory, but I don't want that. I want a monogamous relationship like the one I have now. But I just can't figure out how to also explore my sexual side without getting all crazy, if that makes sense. I just don't want to hurt people anymore.

Edit: I'm so sorry to hear that you were raped. I think I have a victim complex, so sexual situations I have been in that are, by definition, rape, I tell myself aren't rape and I am just being dramatic, and that I put myself in that situation so I can't say it was rape. But I don't know. There is so much about my life that I have just jammed down and try not to think about. 

And good luck to you and your recovery as well :)"
bipolar,epx3aig,t1_epws9j7,1559591016.0,"I am glad that I have the diagnosis, it's sort of nice to know. My family crazy runs deep, but most of them self-medicate with alcohol. It's hard to even say where it came from. None of them ever got diagnosed. My dad had an uncle Jack who everyone said was crazy. Most of my family are alcoholics. My brother is turning into a serious alcoholic and got a DUI last year. He also is really paranoid, and I am worried that he will get worse and do something violent. I'm at the point where I won't tell him where I live, because he scares me. I wonder if he's bipolar too. Basically I had to cut ties with my family recently because they weren't supportive of me getting mental health care. They would hand me a beer before getting me the psychiatric care I truly need. 

I actually feel kind of relieved. I'm self-aware enough to know that I need help, and I feel like I kind of ""escaped"" my family. I just keep thinking of my grandma. She was my favorite person. She was so stable and organized, she had a college degree in mathematics and was crazy smart, she became an accountant, had four kids with my grandpa, raised them, then got back to work. She was always there for me, even though she had that German Catholic way of not talking about anything too emotional. She was just a hard-working woman who created so much stability for me in my childhood. I loved being at her house, away from my family. Somehow my grandma and grandpa were fairly normal...my grandpa might have had ADHD. My grandma's dad was an alcoholic and maybe he was bipolar. She didn't know him much at all. Anyway! My point is that I just always imagine being back at my grandma's house and we're doing a puzzle or something and I'm just looking outside at her yard, which was up against a big wooded area and it was nice and secluded. Whenever I get upset or depressed I think of that."

I have a lot of body issues but at this point I have just embraced that I am going to be a squat, chest heavy lady like my grandma haha. I have short legs and it used to bother me, because I wanted to have a tiny waist and long legs. But tbh I have really good balance. Like, legit I won a log rolling contest at camp...I mean, not like I’m gonna use that skill lol but...

Anyway I am just trying to love my body not how it looks but for what it does for me. I mean, my hands work, my legs work. I like my eyes. I’m weird about sunscreen so my face is pretty nice and even. I have stretch marks on my thighs and my arms have always looked flabby to me, but oh well. I’m strong and sturdy. 

And what has helped a lot really is not talking to my mom and being around my boyfriend and his family, who I am convinced have never been judgmental in their entire lives!!! It’s amazing."

raisedbynarcissists,epucdqr,t3_bvx2vx,1559507453.0,"How terrible. My mom was always shit talking other people who were fat, too. It was always only women, tho. Fat men got a pass I guess. When I was 8 I remember making sure my watch could fit on the tightest hole. I constantly looked in the mirror to make sure my belly didn’t stick out too far.

In middle school I was eating so little I didn’t get my period for a year. Then my parents got mad at me and said it was because I was vegetarian lol. Well no it’s because I literally wasn’t eating because my mom would point out my stomach all the time. 

My mom wasn’t as bad as yours and they didn’t restrict food. I’m so sorry you went through that. I hope you know that you are healthy when your doctor says so. If you’re a size 10 or a size 0. And you’re right it’s none of her damn business!! Plus women’s clothes makes NO sense and I swear sometimes a size 6 fits me and sometimes I have to go up to a size 14 or higher! I hate it lol."

She has gained some weight and always wears big baggy shirts to cover it even tho she’s still got a decent body for her age. And they always send stuff that’s really flattering. I’m just not super girly so I wonder if they have stuff that’s more masculine I guess? Like no dresses haha.
adhdwomen,epub35g,t3_bw0y0v,1559506847.0,"I feel this. My mom was always super girly and always looked nice. She was always trying to get me to be like her and to do my hair nice and my makeup. She pointed out my acne and messy hair all the time. 

I tried the nails thing, and tbh it’s just too much of a fuss. I can’t sit still to get my nails done and it’s just such a chore. Plus it feels weird. So now I just try to keep my nails free of dirt, which I forget sometimes because I’m out in my garden a lot lol.

It’s also important to realize that there isn’t any one “you.” You can have pink nail polish with glitter or you can have no nail polish. You can dress in heels or wear a t shirt and jeans.

As far as makeup, I would suggest trying to learn how you learn best. Is it through instruction? If so, maybe you have a friend who is good at makeup who can show you some things. Or, you could see a highly rated makeup artist in your area. If you go to Sephora and see someone with nice makeup, ask them to help! Otherwise, I really like YouTube tutorials. And for eyebrows...eyebrows are just UGH. For everyone. You will hear eyebrows are like sisters not twins lol.

My “style” right now is just a t-shirt, Jean jacket and jeans or yoga pants, with black boots. I usually have my hair just down or in a pony tail. I find this look easy because I can take off layers or add on. Now that the androgynous look is kind of more in I feel better. I don’t feel good in a dress. I tried the whole platinum blonde, nails done, tanning lotion, and full face makeup but my GOD it took too much fucking time.

Anyway. Whatever you choose to do is you! I still do feel less womanly than other girls but...I’m 29 now so. I’m never gonna figure it out."

Do you go to therapy for your bipolar disorder? I’m seeing someone now for ADHD but they said bipolar is something they aren’t trained to help with. So I’m wondering if I should be seeing someone else. I have the medication and a psychiatrist but I’m not sure what therapies are available for bipolar. I’ve done CBT before but it wasn’t helpful at all."
adhdwomen,epu9d5t,t1_epn9783,1559506037.0,"Wow. I’m glad to hear about how much of a difference the meds make. It makes me wonder if all the anti depressants did actually make me feel worse, because I had gotten on a lot of them only to stop cold turkey - not sure if that was just an impulse thing or actually me realizing it was making things worse.

And yes, I’m taking medication now. Apparently it takes like 5 weeks to fully be effective. I just want to live a normal life. Can’t imagine suffering with this for a lifetime with no answers."
adhdwomen,epu94ux,t1_epmy9od,1559505928.0,"So sad but true. When I was young I just accepted what doctors told me. Now I know to get second third or even fourth opinions. It took a lot of effort. But knowing something was off about my brain kept me pursuing some kind of answer. 

Funny that now at 29 I was able to get meds off of just a simple questionnaire and my psychiatrist knowing my background/family history. Whereas before it was just “nah you just have depression here’s some Prozac”"
adhdwomen,epu8wkp,t1_epkafhs,1559505819.0,"Interestingly I have thought in the past I had BPD. But I was told by a therapist that if I had BPD I wouldn’t be asking to be tested for it. Or something like that. Basically I’ve just known for a while that I wasn’t “just depressed” even tho I’ve been told that for most of my life. It’s like ok, do normal people feel fine up until puberty and then boom the crazy hits and that’s just normal??? I kept saying “I don’t feel normal” and they’d say “well what is normal” and I’m like idk I’m not a fucking doctor, you tell me lol.

I feel like because I was 19 when I first sought help I was not taken seriously. Now that I’m 29 and still experiencing the same shit suddenly it’s serious now.

Anyway. It does suck. It’s really reassuring tho that people here have similar issues, although I know BPD is different. It’s good to know I’m not totally doomed haha."
adhdwomen,epu8ctd,t1_eptmhjy,1559505561.0,"Wow thank you. That helps.

I heard “don’t be so dramatic” or “you’re fine” all the time from my mom. 

With my boyfriend now I have been getting better at saying how I feel. But mostly I am just comfortable saying I am “sick” or “depressed.” But I do have such a temper and often become angry because of how I am misinterpreting events. It’s something we are going to discuss in therapy actually."
