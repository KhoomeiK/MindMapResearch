ADHD,fr1vlwf,t1_fr1nbgy,1589826690.0,Thank you! :)
JUSTNOMIL,fr1v3sh,t3_gm1f32,1589826459.0,"First defintely document it all messages from them, phone calls, texts etc, you saying stop contacting, friends asking on their behalf and your responses; literally anything that pertains to them so you have have a paper trail for legal reasons. Secondly, I would make a post and/or directly contact people saying that you have gone non-contact and that you're asking for anyone on your friends list to not pass on information, photos etc to your NC in laws or any of their flying monkeys. That you will remove anyone who is found to be doing so and that this is the only warning they get as it seems youve already conveyed your wishes. 

Third, send them a cease and desist letter, stating that you wish for them to stop all contact. Email it, mail it, post it to their facebooks, have them served etc to make sure they defintely got it and cannot dispute it. Include in the letter any and all previous dates & times you've requested them to stop. If you want you can include 'c&d contact until further notice', but it sounds like your ready for forever NC.

Obviously, it is ultimately up to you as their parent to decide, you know what is best for your family! I cant stress that enough, but I probably have a different opinion/view than most people on here about the USB because I am missing half my family tree. So I thought I'd chime in on that:

I would review the USB and any other contents of the package. Please remember that you dont have to acknowledge getting the package or allow them to contact to you/your children in any way. If it's just a bunch of pictures videos and some 100% for sure facts on them, what they like, what they did for work etc, I would keep it. If any FM's ask about it you can always say I have no idea what your talking about.

As your in-laws are wanting your kids to know them via usb, I genuinely think the kids should have a say in the matter, even if its not until years from now. (I'm assuming your children are young) You can totally explain to your kids, when its age appropriate/they're able to understand, that these are their grandparents while also conveying why you've gone no contact. Then they can decide to toss it or view it. 

Coming from a kids point of view: Before I was old enough to fully be told my family situation I often wondered why I never heard from my dad's side grandparents/other family. It defintely created some super complicated feelings, and questions that I didnt want to ask my mom or tell her how I felt because I knew the subject hurt her. Which led to more complicated feelings. She eventually told me that she was afraid I would want to contact them and start a relationship with them. But that wasnt until they had long since passed. 

I completely understand why she did it, and I highly doubt I would've contacted them, but I do regret not being given the option. 

But again that's just my opinion, and it's up to you to keep it or not!"
JUSTNOMIL,fr1lsmd,t1_fr1jwmg,1589821948.0,"Agreed, Husband definitely would have to be on the same page. 

Seeing this post really hurts my heart because I have fertility issues too and also had miscarriages that were almost totally due to stress. I know how awful it feels. But if I ever do get pregnant again, I feel sorry for anyone that puts even the smallest of stresses on me. Anyone like that will be automatically kicked out of my life. Family or friend, even my SO at least until the end, if not permanently.  I'll put myself in a bubble if I have to.

You should always put yourself first regardless, but especially in a situation like this. <3"
JUSTNOMIL,fr1j6sf,t3_gm1ghs,1589820653.0,"I would block anyone that has anything to do with your MIL even if its only for the extent of your pregnancy.

CPTSD,fr1fyw3,t3_glmqkj,1589819055.0,"If it helps, I brought this up with my trauma therapist recently and she told me it's fine. I cant stand the sound of silence and constantly need to be occupied, so I use TV music phone etc to keep my brain from going to dark places. She told me that there are way worse ways to cope, as long I'm getting enough sleep and it's not interfering with anything/anyone else negatively.  But if it was bothering me, find some productive things to occupy myself instead. 

You should defintely deal with emotions, but dont force it on yourself like this. Going from not dealing to diving in it 100% isnt the best way to go. Dealing with emotions like this unfortunately takes time and patience as well as being kind to yourself."

I do to, I was finally pulling myself together and was almost halfway done through physical therapy when this kicked off. (Incurred severe injuries during a traumatic event) I was also about to go back to school after having to take a year off because of injury on top of already having medical disability conditions.

Until i finish PT I wont know if I can work again. I was already having to change my career to work around my disabilities, so it just feels like a punch in the gut after working so hard to get back to some semblance of normal. My injury prevented me from walking last August, and I committed to Physical, Chiropractic, and Muscle therapy for 5 days a week plus pain management then until Corona. I can now walk short distances without a cane, longer with thanks to therapy and a nerve blocker. 

I feel very defeated that I busted my butt and went through all that pain to get back in my feet as fast as I can just to have this road block. I can only do some of the exercises at home, so everyday that I'm out of therapy almost certainly means another day added. :("

CPTSD,fplxd6p,t3_ge3ogp,1588721299.0,"I feel the same way. I *think* the goal is to eventually not let everything trigger me. Because pretty much everything does. When i do interact socially and people say something triggering, most of the time they defintely didnt mean it that way or they were totally ignorant of what they were saying could be interpreted wrong. I try to remind myself of that, and that I cannot punish or blame other people for the trauma done to me by a few certain humans. If I cant calm myself down internally, I excuse myself from the situation. If they are someone I feel comfortable with, after I calm down I will explain what they said and how/why it hurt me. If not I either dont associate with them or try to let it go.

It's not easy of course, its still a major work in progress, and it takes alot of forcing myself to do it. Ive been working on it for years. 

But I used to be a social butterfly and I really miss having friends, so to me it's worth it."
CPTSD,fp77km6,t3_gbgoes,1588365494.0,"Yes, I am picky with friendships. When someone new starts messaging me constantly it makes me not want to talk them. All my current friends understand that I like loose communication, in that sometimes I dont want to talk for days or weeks, but I will respond eventually. The ones that do understand, i have no problem with them messaging me 9000 times before I reply because since they understand that I might not reply immediately, it doesnt cause me aniexity about feeling forced or pressured to respond when I'm not up to talking to humans. 

I do at least warn people of this, I dont expect them to be psychic lol. But if they then continue to message me ""hey"" or ""what's up"" every single day with no reply I just block them. It's very hard for me to set boundaries, so I dont have patience for people who break pretty much the only solid boundary I have.

I also have hardly anything to talk about, everything has been noneventful and that was before the coronavirius. I dont mind people checking in to see how I am, but when they keep asking me what's new and I keep saying nothing as I have been in quarantine since Day 1, (compromised immune system) it just annoys me. But I hate repeating myself so at least I can answer why on that one.

I do wish I knew why this happens though, i mean yes the aniexity part, but why does it cause the aniexity in the first place?"

Embrace your grief, but dont let it hold your breath and dont keep it inside. Scream at the top of your lungs outloud or into a pillow. Shout, cry, break some stuff, rage, do what you need to do to get through the next minute/hour/day. But please don't ever give up. 

Nobody's ever really gone, they leave an imprint on the people that love them. She's with you even when it doesnt feel like it. She's there in the things you enjoyed together, or the things she introduced to you; in her mannerisms or speech that you may have picked up on and adopted as your own. She'll be in the stories you tell when your reminiscing with old friends or sharing your stories about her with new friends in the future.

The point now is that you've gotta live your life for both you and her. She wouldnt want you to give up or stop, she'd want you to have great life. 

As long as you carry her memory, she will never truly be gone."
CPTSD,fog4gcm,t1_fog0v0e,1587747752.0,That's exactly how I feel too. Anybody gives me genuine positive praise/compliment and I just look at them waiting for the 'but...'

coronationstreet,fo9gjii,t1_fo8ot3z,1587618906.0,"Same. As someone that went through that, I want to see someone standing up for themselves after realizing what is happening,  and doing the hard but brave thing: Leaving him. I want people who may be in that situation now to see a story like that and be inspired to leave. I feel like killing him off doesn't really show that.

But I'm also worried now that Yasmeen will get done for either murder or maybe attempted murder and it will drag on longer. I've already stopped watching months ago because it was too triggering. I've just been reading summaries here and there.

I went through what she went through, so it's not as if I dont understand the importance of the storyline. But i want to see her come out having defended herself and it be known that Geoff was a controlling douche. Maybe if it hadnt gone on *this* long, a guilty until proven innocent story may have worked or been appropriate. But with it draaaagging on this long, I dont think her being arrested and having to deal with all her peers thinking Geoff is the victim and was right all along until some *thing* happens and they're all so sorry they were wrong is appropriate.

Most were on purpose, but some werent. Those were the hardest. What kills me though is I am a magnet for abusive, narcissistic, or just plain terrible people. 9 out 10 people I meet and try to form a friendship or relationship with are at least one of the former.

I cant even trust myself to make decent friends. But I know a good chunk of it, is despite all the awful stuff that's happened to me, I still see the good in people. Therapy has been a big help though since I started last year.

I also remain quiet now until I get to know people and read them/the room before ""making"" the best choice of topics to speak about or reply too. I've gotten called a bitch/asshole because I'm so quiet, they misinterpret. I only know because when I finally felt comfortable and opened up (mimicked or not), they would laugh and tell me that's what they thought of me at first, but I turned out to be so nice/interesting/insert other adjective.

It's been so ingrained in me that I'm exaggerating or not telling the truth that I sometimes dont believe myself.

I've had doctors now for 3 solid years that fully believe me and know my medical history thankfully. But at the ER recently I totally lost it, bc they didnt listen to me at all or believe me even when my complete medical record was in the system. Because I'm ""too young"" to have these issues. They also prescribed me pain pills that had I taken them couldve killed me due to a fatal drug combination, after I verbally told them what I was on, physically gave them my medication list and it was also on file.

The best part was the doctor ""went on vacation"" so they couldnt prescribe me an alternate medicine. It was the worst pain ugh. But on the brighter side, nobody will have to deal with that again.

I lost everything as well due to PsA and fibro and had to start over from a shelter. If you can scrounge the money for Obamacare get it. The ""minimum"" you ""expect to make"" is around 8-9000 to qualify, play around with it. Then get the silver package of an insurance, low out of pocket total low copays its $30 a month. You can go two months without paying before they suspend your benefits, but your first month has to be upfront. You have to get references to specific doctors from your set primary care hence the cheap price, but they will work with you to get who you need. You only get 3 shots at a good Primary on this plan so research. This plan allows you to get the best doctors at a reasonable price. You will qualify UNLESS you are eligible for Medicare/Medicaid which they will sort for you once you apply. You will qualify for a special enrollment, you can check moved or lack of/lost healthcare to do so.

*I cant stress this enough it does not matter what you make or dont make, the wording is ""what you expect to make"". Make the system work for you and you can get healthcare as soon as April 1st. And your first stop after getting a Primary should be Dermatologist and a Rheumatologist. *

Disabilty also counts as income as well and you can also update the healthcare application at any time if/when your situation changes. So apply for that too and get your applying for disability benefits letter, which after applying will be available on the SSA website. Even if you think you wont get it, apply. While applying, you automatically get the highest amount of food stamps available in your state as long as it is being processed, but you have to apply for it separately but you may be able to do that online depending on your state.

Applying for disability will also automatically send you off to Medicare/Medicaid eligibility. If you've already applied, find a disabilty lawyer and appeal, they will not charge you upfront unless their scum, so find one that doesnt. Put that you are homeless on your application, but list a mailing address that you know you can collect mail from for at least 6 months for sure just in case. If you dont have access to one and need to, wait until your in a shelter, they will let you get mail there and provide a letter saying your staying there.

If you're not in survival mode, you need to be. It's awful and it's hard, but it is possible to get through this. You may have to be selfish and ruthless and that sucks but do whatever it takes to keep your head above water. 

One more thing: file for unemployment immediately. If you did not break company/moral rules on purpose you will more than likely qualify. Even if you did (not judging) apply anyway, you still might get it, which also gives you 3 months of food stamps. Google: (Insert your state name) Department of Labor Unemployment application. 

Good luck."

I'm on Humira and I even had the radio frequency SJL injection combo ""therapy"" (aka nerve block) last week to kill my lower back nerves for 6mo - 1 year to give my muscles a break and  guess what? I can't feel my back muscles, but they can't numb my spine! I've still got pain there 24/7 and I'm the skinniest I've been in 10 years! 

My arthritis has spread so much that when I have the rare luxury of going to the chiropractor, bc insurance doesnt cover it ugh, they literally have to pop every single joint in my body thanks to a combination of arthritis/joint stiffness/my body not making enough vitamin D. Not an exaggeration or a joke. Every last one, from my neck to hips to my feet. They pop each individual toe, each finger and their knuckles, even my jaw ffs and everything else in between! 

All the hugs for having to deal with that bs. <3"

Also go to your community college counselor and tell them what's up. They may be able to offer you more localized help."

But when all else fails including medication, I try to just distract myself as much as possible. Music on and read a book. Or TV on something I dont have to pay attention to fully and play a phone game. Or if I have a friend awake I'll get them to call and tell me about anything and hang on everything they say.

I've noticed that if I don't do this, all I can do is focus on the pain and time drags on. With a distraction, although still there it's not at the forefront and I start to relax."
homeless,fh7iuib,t3_f1oqsm,1581333979.0,"The homeless charity isnt going to give me (or people like me) the cash I need to pick up my prescriptions or the gas/bus fare I need to get to the pharmacy or to doctor visits for treatment, so I can eventually get better and get back to work etc.

If you're happy to give the money, and have extra to do so, do you boo. Sure theres a chance that you may be giving money to fund ""bad habits"", but that $20 could be going towards food, medicine, clothes, etc. And even if it is going to a ""bad habit"" or not on needed items, homeless people are still people and still need to blow off steam too. Maybe that $20 allows them to visit a friend further away than their normal route, or go see a movie, or get something nice for themselves. 

The absolute monotony of planning out every single last penny, including future ones, while trying to dig myself out of this shithole is so frustrating at times. Something as simple as buying wet wipes today set me off because it was either wet wipes or arthritis meds this week. 

You are doing a very kind thing, and wherever that money goes, I am sure they apperciate it. <3"

coronationstreet,fg5spsl,t1_ffxwhj2,1580537456.0,"Just wanted to say that knowing youre from a different community to the type of community in Manchester, makes your views [at least to me] make more sense.  I'm from Manchester but I travel and have moved a lot and have met so many people from different places and countries.

I have met adults who are 20+, 30+, etc. who have never met a LGBQT person before. I met a girl in her twenties who had never seen a not white person *in person* until she visited america. She had only seen them on TV. But to people raised in diverse places that arent aware of places like that, it can seem crazy or surprising. I've even seen and known people who just genuinely cant believe there are places like that arent as diverse.  

I can completely understand that if your community isnt the same and you havent been to the city a show is based in or have information about that place it's based on, you'd ask questions like this. I think that the pushbacks/dislikes you're getting are because the people who normally ask those types of questions BUT who *are* from diverse places, are asked by people who tend to be racist/homophobic etc. [Which you are not! ] I am used to questions like this but there are tons of people, although well intentioned, find these questions about these subjects to be awkward because they are sensitive topics to a lot if people.

Changing subjects a bit, In my opinion I think the amount of things like abuse storylines are actually good because there are so many different types of domestic abuse that people dont know or arent aware that those behaviors are not okay and are a usuve. The Geoff storyline doesnt bother me bc it's going on long or written badly, it bothers me because its 100% accurate. What is happening to Yaz happened to me. Coercive control is almost impossible to prove and the person, Geoff in this instance, does a very good job of painting the abused, Yaz, as the instigator to the public community. They do this so should the abused complain or seek help the abused will not be believed easily, if at all. In the UK it is a felony to commit such abuse, unlike MANY other places. [where I was it isnt]

But what caught my eye about your initial post was actually the bit about climate change deniers. It just, to me, doesnt seem to fit with rest of the list? I havent noticed any comments about that in particular but I have been skipping scenes on the show lately. I did catch one about calling all anti vaxxers crazy. 

But to answer that one, I am a believer in climate change [and vaccinating], but where I went to school and am living [not UK] everyone has access to basic education and basic science at minimum, with alot of people being able to go on to post education, like University or College. The most polite way to say this is: people here [and largely associated with] that deny climate tend to be uneducated people who don't use facts as a basis for their beliefs. They just believe it ""cause somebody said so."" . I would even say it has become a big stereotype that people who deny climate/anti vaxxers are uneducated and stupid. 

Personally, as long as a person who doesn't believe/have my same views and I can talk civilly about it, without pushing our beliefs on each other, and no expectation of changing each others minds on the topic then we'll get a long. 

Hope you have a good weekend and that my reply helps!"

Last week she regressed so far back, she went off on me in an abusive rant like she did when i was a child, (hasnt happened in 10 years) as well as forgot how her own mother died. 

My family wont listen/doesnt care to force her to get checked out, and she almost died from pneumonia two years ago because shes so 'against' doctors. Dont get me wrong it could still just be babies rabies. But a sudden and massive behavior change like this with no previous indications, could be a sign of a major mental problem/breakdown."

doctorwho,fevxg0n,t3_eqhcd3,1579402723.0,"I'm on the other side of the fence. I like having multiple companions because that's how it was in Classic Who, and because theres no 'companion attracted/in love with the doctor"" subplot convulating the story. It's just about adventures and travelling with the doctor's mates, like it should be. I'm more kinda upset that Jodie is such a terrific actor, but shes been given such crappy writing to work with. I like her as the Doctor alot, she shines through the awful writing Chibnall provides. 

Plus every other companion has taken up an equal, if not more amount of time previous to this. It has revolved around the individual way more. The difference now being they are writing the Doctor to be super similar to The 1st Doctor. Doesnt talk about themselves and anything personal much at all. More of an educational field trip she takes everyone on. Just sort of doesnt want to be alone, but doesnt feeling opening up at the moment. Which I'm sure she eventually will as this season goes on."

I've lived here 25 of 31 years, and my family is useless, so idk mentally (I've got loads else going on plus C-PTSD) if I could uproot myself and ditch everything I own + my animal just have to go there and hope I might get help/a council house without having to live on the streets for a long long while. Plus idk if the gov could help get me back and if I did I would never be able to come back to america having ""abandoned my status/residency"". (Not that that's more important than my health.)

I'm allowed to get both, I just cant get supplemental unless I've worked a total of 10 years since I'm well under retirement age. They said I'll defintely get disability in my interview eventually, I just may have to appeal cause no one hardly gets it on the first try.

I've unfortunately lately had to correct some doctors (so fun ugh) because the tried to give me medicine that interferes badly/fatal with my PsA medicines. Had one tell me ""No meloxicam is okay to take."" When my other doctor said ""Its probably not a good idea but if you havent had any effects so far its fine."" Online it says the longer equivalent of 'oh hell no' lol. Go to my pharmacy and first thing they say is ""We can no longer fill Meloxicam for you since you are now on xx. Its flagged in our system as do not combine."" 

My response: ""That's what I thought, no problem.""

For that med, you could look around online for a prescription discount card to help easethe cost if you want to switch. You may also be able to get some samples direct from the company or your doctor. I had to do that for migraine meds awhile back when they weren't covered!

Good luck with everything and I hope it all goes as smoothly as possible!! xx"
