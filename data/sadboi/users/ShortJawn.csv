miraculousladybug,ersmhwh,t3_c3qock,1561218338.0,If they start dating it would be a good thing because Adrien would see that he likes marinette/ladybug and he can't change that and Marinatte will maybe get over her crush and start a friendship with Adrien. That way they will develope deeper feelings for eachother (sr if my writting is sloppy)

The worse part is that this specific group of girls (that always judge/make fun of what me and my friend are doing) was in the classroom and they laughed  they didn't even try to hide it they laughed and the teacher just told them calmly to stop LIKE ALWAYS...
