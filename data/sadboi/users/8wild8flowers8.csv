mentalhealth,ffndmmg,t3_eu6zak,1580064583.0,"good question, I have only been to therapy a dozen or so times but would cry through the whole thing and like you once it starts it takes a long time to stop. It also looks like I have been punched in the face, could not go back to work, hint, book late appointment. I feel like this is a good thing. I think its part of the work. My theory, actually not my theory, but books about this topic say that is that it is a whole lot of stored emotions especially if you grew up in a family that didn't do emotion, this explains it better....

What I do

* use serums, this brand is good and affordable, read through the reviews to see what you think, I have most of them, HYALURONIC ACID VITAMIN C could be a good one to start with [https://www.timelessha.com/collections/anti-wrinkle-serums](https://www.timelessha.com/collections/anti-wrinkle-serums)
* use a face oil, organic jojoba, put this on then after put on more and add foundation, I really like Giorgio Armani luminous silk or a brand called Juice that is organic [https://juicebeauty.com/products/phyto-pigments-flawless-serum-foundation](https://juicebeauty.com/products/phyto-pigments-flawless-serum-foundation) dab a sponge don't swipe to help with finishing texture
* might have to use cream hair remover on face
* a good scrub with a flannel and warm water
* a face mask like [https://juicebeauty.com/collections/green-apple-brightening-skincare/products/green-apple-peel-full-strength](https://juicebeauty.com/collections/green-apple-brightening-skincare/products/green-apple-peel-full-strength) be careful to rest first its strong, maybe just use on nose first where pores are larger, helps with that

Menopause,ff6o3xm,t3_erv12w,1579631331.0,"I so get this. Literally spent last week in bed for days with deep fatigue. I had gone off my bio-identical hormones last September and it seemed ok. I thought my tiredness over the holidays was illness and had spent days in bed then as well. 

I was reading on here I think about deep fatigue and watching some youtube videos and put the pieces together. It had crept in and I had no idea. I am back on the hormones and already feeling better. I am 54 soon to be 55 for ref. I went on the hormones a couple of years ago when I had to leave my husband and dogs and work in another country in a job with long hours that really stressed me out. I am sure stress makes these situations worse. All I would do is work and then go home to bed as so tired.

My job is going away in a few months so there might be some stress related to that.

Each episode explores mental illness, trauma, addiction and negative thinking. ‚ÄúNormalizes what so many others feel but have been too fearful or ashamed to express‚Ä¶ remarkable.‚Äù **-**Psychology Today

Another podcast called Help Me Be Me by Sarah May B. which I think maybe someone on here recommended, is really good. She talks about tools that help her and like the podcast above is really enjoyable listening

This woman youtube channel is awesome - Lisa A. Romano Breakthrough Life Coach. Her videos on codependancy and how our programming from the home we grew up in can really do a number on us have been helpful.

The common thing about these guys is they have all been through it so they really get it

I was reading about how back in the day people would be given lobotomies or locked up in some horrific asylum. It dawned on me, of course, you would try and hide your mental illness back then, the consequences were dire to say the least. In the scheme of things that's not really that long ago. My mother's generation. So I can see being alive in that kind of environment created that mindset.

Even myself as a teenager in the 80s I remember going to the library a train ride away and trying to find a book that would help. I had depression and anxiety but I didn't know. I just knew that something wasn't right. My family don't deal with shite like this, even now, so I just tried to hide it and self medicate with booze.

One possibility is that it has more to do with family history/dynamics, programming growing up, etc than the cologne. I know with my siblings there can be  super subtle sibling rivalry and it's so dumb but hard to get past.

One thing I have become aware of is that whatever bothers us is a great opportunity to take a minute, take a breath, take a step back and have a look under the hood. For me its been a useful tool

Sorry, this probably isn't what you were looking for. I get it tho, it's funny how shite like this is friggen irking and being the bigger person is not satisfying for the ego.

I'm back in another stressful situation again - losing job soon, so makes sense bing bing bing. I also take Prozac which has helped me.

Copy and paste from [https://www.fragrantica.com/designers/Amouage.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/designers/Amouage.html)

His Highness Sayyid Hamad bin Hamoud al bu Said had a dream to restore the great Arabian art of perfumery to the region.  
Amouage is a luxury perfume house established in Oman in 1983 by the Sultan of Oman. Amouage uses traditional for the Middle East perfume ingredients such as agarwood, incense, musk, rose and spices, but the developers of the scents are perfumeurs from the major fragrances&flavor companies.  
The first Amouage fragrance (Amouage was its previous name, now it is known as Amouage Gold) was created by French perfumeur Guy Robert in 1983. Guy Robert has created his masterpieces for Hermes, Dior, Rochas...

Almost all of the perfumes are in the traditional Amouage bottles: bottles with women's scents recall the shape of the Palace Ruwi Mosque in Muskat (Oman); bottles with men's scents have a shape of [Khanjar](https://www.fragrantica.com/designers/%22http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanjar%22), the traditional dagger of Oman.

Designer **Amouage** has **93** perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1983 and the newest is from 2019. Amouage fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Randa Hammami, Cecile Zarokian, Daniel Maurel, Angeline Leporini, Guy Robert, Daniel Visentin, Elise Benat, Bernard Ellena, Alexandra Carlin, Emilie (Bevierre) Coppermann, Lucas Sieuzac, Jean-Claude Ellena, Nathalie Feisthauer, Violaine Collas, Leslie Girard, Pierre Negrin, Karine Vinchon Spehner, Bertrand Duchaufour, Dorothee Piot, Annick Menardo, Maurice Roucel, Gras, Creations Aromatiques, Michele Saramito, Jacques Flori, Alberto Morillas and Richard Herpin."
