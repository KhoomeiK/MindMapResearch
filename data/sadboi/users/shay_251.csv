But I'm glad I finally did get through to him, and trust me I did cry when he asked if he could accommodate me by changing things at home, because my household is really... Chaotic (I'm one of ten children, haha) so it meant a lot for him to take additional responsibilities for one of his older, and more capable children. I said no of course, but my mum is going to help me dealing with my appointments because I am TERRIBLE at dealing with them.
So, happy ending for now, can't wait to see how this progresses! :•)"

Hopefully they wouldn't just charge for no reason and they actually do want to deter kids from stealing cutlery.

EDIT: I feel like I must clarify, I went to a shitty private Islamic school with a total population of about 120 (for both primary and secondary kids), so I'm not the expert on how schools are supposed to be about this kind of stuff. This school literally tries to play matchmaker with girls and boys that are barely 18 and haven't met each other. The kids actually get married. Yes, it's fucked up."
