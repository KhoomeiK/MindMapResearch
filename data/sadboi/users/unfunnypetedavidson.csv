I'm gonna get back to my workbook. PLEASE has gone to shit in this heat wave with no AC. With a heavy cooling rain comes some clarity and wise mind.

Anyway, she's still texting me, and I need to calm down.

I hope I can someday pay forward your goodwill here. Thank you."

I did ask. I knew about the pictures before she told me this and when I asked her, she said she wanted to keep hanging out, but not date because she is back together with this person. So I told her if she was being polite, not to worry about it, but she insists she is being sincere. It would hurt a lot less if that were true.

Most of those 6 billion don't speak the same language and I'll never meet them, and even if I did, my personality is poison, so my options are a lot more limited than 6b."
