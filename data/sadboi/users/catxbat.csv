Positive thinking is a crock. It basically encourages you to shun negative emotions, which isn't healthy at all.

BPD,fksamhn,t1_fks8akg,1584485825.0,"This subreddit actually got me through a lot when I was at my worst. I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone either.

I think BPD is particularly challenging because of how quickly our moods change ‚Äì at least depression is consistent. Even we can't keep up with ourselves a lot of the time.

I tried to approach friendships and relationships like I was ""already better"" and hid all the negative feelings. I did all the work on my own in the background and tried my best to be happy and caring to those around me. If things were hard, I retreated and gave everyone space. If I was feeling suicidal, I came here, or other supportive subreddits for help. It's not the best solution, but I've been able to maintain long-term friendships as a result. 

That's not to say I don't think my friends wouldn't have supported me, I just didn't want to put the burden on them. I don't know if this is a healthy approach or not, so probably don't take this as advice. It was just how I got around the stigma and lack of support.
