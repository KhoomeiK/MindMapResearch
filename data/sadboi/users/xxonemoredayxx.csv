On the other hand, there's something powerful about Alanna being so dedicated that she pretended to be a boy for years to do what she wanted. I worry that saying she's genderfluid might take away from that (like, impression that she's ""mix of both genders"" and that's why she wanted to be a knight). Obviously I don't see her (and other genderfluid folks) that way-- but I worry a little bit.

Another good trans character was Amber/Okha from the Beka Cooper series. Where being trans is portrayed as a god's trick and it shows how some folks may not be good to Amber. And there is also portrayal of Beka going to Amber for advice, and Amber having a following as an entertainer."
