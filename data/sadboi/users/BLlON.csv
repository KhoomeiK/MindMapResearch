mentalhealth,f88myuk,t1_f88fnyo,1574357405.0,"Making your bed is just the first stepping stone of learning to take care of things and it's the first stepping stone of learning to form good habits. Once you're able to have the habit of making your bed, it's easier to form the habit of brushing your teeth, once it's easy to brush your teeth, it's easier to shower and so on and so on. It's not just entirely about making your bed, it's about learning how to form good habits to get you to do better and to get you to take care of yourself more. It's hard to learn good habits if you just try and jump into it, you need to start small and work your way up with your own pace, otherwise you won't get it done, it will be too hard. This way, you don't have to worry so much. You can breathe. You don't have to feel so pressured, this is your own pace and only your own. You won't have to feel so rushed."
mentalhealth,f88e2ad,t3_dzkmwl,1574353110.0,"Start slow and steady. Work your way up. 
Start by making your bed first thing in the morning, even if you don't want to leave it, make it. Do it everyday. Keep doing it until you can and you actually, genuinely do it everyday. Do you have a job? If so that's good. If not, find a job or something to keep you on your feet sometimes. Look at different hobbies and try something out that makes you a little excited to do, or just something to keep you busy and your mind focused. Try to do it as often as you can without draining yourself 100%. While you're looking for something to keep you on you feet, start improving showering and doing laundry (if you don't already). If you don't put much effort into these, it's okay. But try to put a little more effort into it, but not enough to drain you loads. Just try to be yourself. While your laundry is going, keep your mind active. Practice singing or play chess or something. Learn how to code, just do something you gravitate towards a little and to keep your mind busy. A part of taking care of yourself is trying to learn to enjoy the little things more, such as doing a little something during laundry that keeps you focused. That way, you'll be more likely to not think negative and kill your mood as easily. You just need to take your time and build your way up. It may take a while, but you'll get there. slowly keep adding more things to do to take care of yourself."

littlespace,f7f889i,t3_dvkbp9,1573674337.0,"I'm a switch, both a caregiver and little. I'm single now but I used to have an online boyfriend who was mostly little, but can switch sometimes also. We'd usually just FaceTime and talk about things. I'd call him my cute baby boy and puppy and a whole bunch of soft names. We'd eat chicken nuggets and chips(fries) together on call and he'd happily show me his little stuff and it was really nice. Sometimes I'd regress, I'm sort of a middle and a little, my regression goes from around 5-12, but also when I regress I'm always sad, so I'd really just cry myself until I was smaller and I'd usually just pass out. Since I'm alone now, I still get both caretaker and little urges but I try to depress my little side more. Usually I'm just constantly in a caretaking mood, I just wanna coddle and take care of everyone so I just try to be as comforting as I can to people and I call everyone names like ""honeybear"" and ""sweetie"" because it's just something that makes me feel better. When I can't caretake, either due to me not being well mentally, I usually avoid everyone and/or let my more little space side out. I don't go deep into it anymore, since there's no one with me and I have to try to pay attention to my surroundings more, but when I do feel smaller I just like to make forts sometimes and wear something comfortable while I crawl into bed under soft covers and I'll surround myself with my stuffies. Sometimes I watch cartoons if I'm feeling up to it but a lot of the time I read soft and platonic ""little space fanfiction"" because it makes me feel a little more like someone is with me so I don't have to feel so alone. I don't have the best/happiest dynamic, but it's better than nothing I suppose."

Ive begged my parents and until one day when I told them I wanted to kill myself, then they only listened. Sometimes, people will wipe your problems off their shoulders like they are nothing. And it will hurt. But if that happens, you just need to keep fighting for it. It's your right to be happy and it's your right to live. If something is keeping you from that, never give up. Keep reaching out. I wish I did more. You won't be put into a psych ward unless it's 100% life threatening at that moment. When I finally got my first therapist appointment, I was scared. Scared as hell. But my therapist was really nice and I felt so much better. Things are scary, and I'm still scared about asking for help, but it's okay. Reach out and look for the right treatment for you. You may not like your first therapist, and you might have to go through them to find the one you're most comfortable with. But when you do, it's worth  it. You matter. You always will. I hope you're able to reach out. If you go to highschool, ask your counselor about it.

I'm proud of you for trying. And I'm going to be proud of you for you to keep going. You deserve to be happy and safe.

mentalhealth,f4jutbi,t3_dktzjz,1571626708.0,"Honeybear, your feelings are valid, but you can't just let yourself do this to yourself. If you have a yucky feeling about someone, sure, it's a good idea to back off, but if the bad feeling is just you thinking bad too much, you need to work on not pushing people away. In life, you'll never know who will backstab you. And all people leave one-day. Some stay way longer than others, but life is a constant drift and paths don't always cross for a long time. It's unfortunate that we'll both never be 100% sure of who is good and bad for us, but you'll never learn how to see through the little hints and the little lies of the bad people. You'll never get to learn and grow if you hinder your experiences. Things will hurt when you let people close, but eventually the pain will numb and you'll learn to be stronger. If you keep doing this to yourself, you might never be truly happy.  Sometimes getting hurt is in our beat interest, and even though that's really fucked up, it's just how things are. I'm sorry that I can't comfort you and tell you that everything will always be okay. I wouldn't lie to you about that. I'm not going to make you believe something just to have it crash down and hurt and confuse you more. I'm just telling you how it is. I struggle constantly to let people in too. I've even got myself bedridden for months in depression because I was wallowing in it, and it wasn't good. You can't let yourself fall into that deep hole like I did. One day, I realized that I had people that genuinely felt a little like a family, and it was nice. They're not the best family, I still don't talk to them much about how I feel, but I'm getting better. I hope you get better too. The little things DO matter, even if it's just a couple moments of peace. You'll find your little group or your little friend who'll give you this. You just have to keep searching. You can't stop out of fear. You can always push through. I believe in you. I always will. I just hope you can believe in yourself."

Do you feel like you are at a disadvantage? You don't have to go out looking for friends. Just let people come to you, and if you just someday find someone intriguing or you start to like their company, then you can choose to keep them then. If you feel like not having any friends right now is going good for you, that's okay! Some people are better at just managing themselves."
