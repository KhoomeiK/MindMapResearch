And that's with really good insurance. The people who don't have good insurance tend to fall through the cracks or as I used to just manage it themself (poorly) through illicit drugs and just fucking things up. We have cut mental health facilities dramatically since Regan in this country and for many people it just gets so fucking hard to navigate. Not to sound like a grump but it's also easy to pretend that you're fine through the internet on social media and further isolate yourself in a way that I don't believe was possible even 12 years ago.
