LingerieAddiction,fr22w5x,t1_fr20eze,1589830221.0,Definitely the Ultra Sheer lines will be the best for summer. I have to wear compression during the heat especially for my leg and it sucks but after I found that Jobst makes Ultra Sheer versions they are SO much more bearable and easy to put on.
LingerieAddiction,fr1t1wu,t1_fr1iqt2,1589825461.0,"Okay here are some links:

[Jobst Ultra Sheer Lace Band](https://www.amazon.com/JOBST-UltraSheer-Silicone-Compression-Stockings/dp/B07CT9VK4K)

This one is a low compression, has a sexy lace band that she can wear with a garter if she needs. The sheer line is easy to put on and isn't as thick but still gives support.

[Jobst Sheer Diamond Pattern](http://www.jobst-usa.com/product/jobst-ultrasheer-diamond-pattern-stockings)

Cute pattern and sheer stockings that feel lightweight.

This company was created by a woman who was frustrated by the choices of compression garments. There's cute patterns and some lace options in various styles.

Nice pattern tights, thigh highs, and knee high socks. This company is in France but they ship worldwide."
LingerieAddiction,fr1indo,t1_fr1i6hr,1589820385.0,Okay so she doesn't need medical grade or a high compression correct?
LingerieAddiction,fr1hb4d,t3_gm4d77,1589819722.0,"Hello! I actually also wear compression garments for lymphedema on my left leg! 

Yes there are some sexy choices but very few, first may i ask how high of a garment does she need? For instance I can wear a knee high sock, thigh high or a full stocking that goes up to the waist in my case. Also what compression does she need? 10-15, 20-30, or 30-40 mmHg? 

I'll send you some links after I hear back."
