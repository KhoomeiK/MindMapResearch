This sub is incredibly judgey and expectations are not realistic of parents. Of course parents deserve to be selfish sometimes and need to make time for themselves. Yes, kids should come first, but a parent is still a human with needs. Kids don’t benefit from burnt out parents. 

Saying that, I don’t think your wife is handling balancing her needs and your kid’s needs very well at all.  But this might come from a place of desperation or exhaustion. There is not enough info here to say what’s causing her behavior. If your wife is working, this might also be a contributing stress factor. Even if she seems “normal” she might be hiding some negative feelings. You two should talk and find out the source of her behavior. You might need to hire part time help or schedule some alone time for each of you. Or maybe enlist a relative to watch the kids every once in a while. 

There are many solutions, but you need to work together and approach her gently. If after all this she still continues with this sort of behavior, then perhaps she is the A-hole."

The Therapist will talk you through it and give you some sort of diagnosis and a Psychiatrist will formally diagnose you and will know how to medicate you. I made the mistake of going to my GM first and she gave me a questionnaire to diagnose depression, but she was too careful with the dosages and I got 25mg of sertraline which was WAY too low, then she increased it to 50, which was awful because it got rid of the anxiety but not the severe depression so I was starting to develop worse thoughts. Only the 100mg worked, so overall it took 2 very shitty months to start benefitting from the meds. 

I’m in California so I qualified for temporary disability, took 6 weeks off. I was completely dysfunctional, so the break was needed. I was able to quit my job after that. I know not everyone can do this, and maybe not everyone needs it, but work was the major factor for me. 
 
I can see the process of getting the right meds being super frustrating and painful, so I recommend going to more than one type of professional for help, they might each diagnose you differently too, so you get a more complete network of support and help.

Burnout sneaks up on you, she might not recognize the symptoms until it’s too late. If she shows signs of depression, worsening forgetfulness, deteriorating ability to focus, weird physical pain, insomnia, and lack of appetite, she may be burning out.  Might be helpful to talk to her about what she is going and maybe present her with some information about what burnout is. It’s much worse than just stress and that’s a big misconception. But you really can’t do anything other than inform her or perhaps take on more of the housework. You can work with her to prioritize her tasks as well. 

However, if she is happy and healthy, just keep doing what you are doing, this might just be her personality and that’s great. Either way, don’t tell her what to do, you risk coming off as controlling condescending.

AskReddit,f4ocyem,t3_dl8phj,1571699678.0,I paint and study Art History. Kinda lose it when I’m not creating any art.

unpopularopinion,f4m9pux,t3_dl2x9x,1571675898.0,"I don’t think that no one cares if an adult goes missing. There were so many stories of intense search parties forming for adults who went missing. In my area we also get Silver alerts all the time. These are kind of like Amber alerts, but for seniors who go missing. 

I do think we take adult suicides less seriously than teen suicides. With an adult it’s almost like we accept that person’s life was indeed lonely and hopeless, but with teens we are sad about all the lost potential."

unpopularopinion,f4avqcm,t3_dk5pew,1571502344.0,Truly an unpopular opinion. I personally hate traffic. I’m going to try your method though. I think it will be hard in my area because often traffic is going less than 5mph. Maybe I’ll start enjoying traffic more! I doubt it though.

AskReddit,f407frb,t1_f3zz5le,1571287654.0,"Are you able to recall the appearance of places you visited via words? Do you appreciate visual arts/create art? 


I’m super curious as my memory is primarily visual."

One time I threw one away in my aunt’s bathroom bin and her dog found it and ate it and left pieces all over the floor. I found out later...my poor aunt cleaned it up."
