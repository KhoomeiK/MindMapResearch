AnxietyDepression,fntz18y,t3_g3j4c9,1587251326.0,Yes I totally understand and you're welcome.
AnxietyDepression,fntoqdn,t3_g3j4c9,1587245897.0,"Hi, 

Thank you so much this all makes sense and I totally agree with you. Ive been going through a situation that has reminded me of a traumatic event and I was going a bit nuts. A lot of the people around me like my family haven't had a positive impact on my mental health. I'm in a very toxic environment right now. I've been trying to read things and listen to music that makes sense feel good. But thank you again for this post. My DMs are also open."
toxicparents,fllfotr,t1_flko2eu,1585259446.0,Thank you for understanding. And yes it sucks that both of need to go through this. I just hope that things turn out good for us. I hope that you're able to get help. You don't deserve to be ever treated the wrong way.
toxicparents,fliuuu8,t3_fowes0,1585191278.0,I totally understand because my step dad is the same way. He's abusive towards all of us and I feel bad for him sometimes because I know he's very sad and depressed and full of lot anger and he's not satisfied with his life. I wish I could help him but I don't know how to.
toxicparents,flir2kx,t3_fopaje,1585188690.0,Thank you for this!
teenagers,fl2zqd4,t3_fm394z,1584764329.0,Yes is the most amazing and reliving feeling ever.
depression,fknnytv,t3_fj15uq,1584370177.0,Yes this is how I feel right now.
AnxietyDepression,fkkkt1m,t3_fiwxo5,1584286283.0,Hey you're going to be okay I promise. ❤️
AnxietyDepression,fkkkqna,t3_fiussh,1584286241.0,"Omg I really thought I was the only. The same happens to me and it really sucks because I feel like other people think I have a problem when I just get super nervous around people. I just wish it would go away and I feel because of being like this I would never be able to have a job where I won’t feel like this around people. I guess me feeling like this has to do with the mental, emotional, verbal and domestic abuse I received from my step dad."
AnxietyDepression,fkjbcpg,t3_fiizl4,1584241151.0,Yes this has been happening to me for the past 9 months or so. It happens to me a lot when alone and I'm very anxious. I looks like things are moving or as if someone was there. So it makes hyper vigilant of my surroundings. I don't stress over it I just tell myself it's normal and I just keep focusing on what I'm doing. But it gets worst late at night when I'm laying down in the dark by myself because I feel like someone is watching me. Even when I'm on the phone with my boyfriend late at night I still feel like there's something in my room besides us and I feel very anxious. This tends to happen to me almost everyday specially when I'm alone and my anxiety is very high.
ptsd,fkg4teg,t3_fi7nam,1584149954.0,This is exactly how I feel
AnxietyDepression,fkcmnk1,t3_fgu7nq,1584056369.0,"I understand tbh even tho I tell myself they might not be mad at me I sometimes do feel like maybe they’re actually mad at me. But I hope you really do get better, best of luck :)"
AnxietyDepression,fk73p9r,t3_fgu7nq,1583926739.0,"I feel you because I feel like this as well. I always think that people don’t like me because of their facial expressions or I think that they’re mad at me because maybe they looked at my direction with a frown on their face or with a serious face but their facial expression has nothing to do w me. But I feel you, you’re not alone. 


What I try to do is just ignore it and tell myself that their expression has nothing to do with me and try to focus my attention on something else."
AnxietyDepression,fisslvh,t3_f998ci,1582692207.0,This is honestly how I feel everyday tbh
AnxietyDepression,fhz8p81,t3_f5dk6r,1581993423.0,I’m so happy for you! ❤️
AnxietyDepression,fhqjzyb,t3_f4aeim,1581805554.0,"I understand how you’re feeling exactly. I have those moments when I’m feeling really lonely and like I have no one which really sucks. I can’t take your sadness and pain away but one thing I can tell you is, that suicide is not an option and that everything will pass. In 10 years from now this won’t matter and you’ll just look back at it as a sad moment in your life. I don’t really have any friends and the friends I do have live far from me or are busy w their lives but we try to text here and there. Everything will be okay.

You can try something fun that can take your mind off that or go to the town fiesta with your cousins, siblings, or parents. You don’t need your friends you got your family.

You got this, remember everything will pass and you have a whole life ahead please don’t end it. You got this.

You’re a warrior!"
emotionalabuse,fe5vl1g,t1_fe5u3xy,1578875922.0,"I totally agree with you with this. Because I use to think like that, that other people have it worst than me and I would belittle my own pain.

My father is like that, he knows that’s he’s hurting me but he refuses to accept it and instead he justifies it by saying that he’s doing it for my own good.

He’s offensive, manipulative, verbally and emotionally abusive.

And he says he things he does are normal and that other parents do it as well."
emotionalabuse,fe5v5pi,t3_enu01z,1578875662.0,"Hi,

Yes I agree with you. It’s emotional abuse. My dad  does most of the these things too me as well I my mother. They also hold me accountable for past mistakes I made years ago and they’re very strict and controlling.

I grew up in a household of domestic abuse and till this day I get abused by my parents. 

But I suggest to you to tell a school counselor or a therapist, they will give you the right professional help.

Remember to always believe in yourself and to keep fighting. You will be out of this environment before you even know it.

Keep fighting and don’t be afraid to speak up to a school counselor or therapist.

You got this!"
pokemongo,eyv78ox,t3_cyqdgh,1567482872.0,I agree
BreakUps,eyshmlt,t3_cyeekg,1567398507.0,I am now in month 2 going on 3 in a week and I’m feeling empty and alone but I’m slowly starting to get use to the fact that I am single and I’m slowly starting to focus on myself and on my goals. But thank you for the post.
BreakUps,eyshej9,t3_cyi0k9,1567398284.0,Thank you for posting this. And even though I was the one who broke things off I did it for the best of both me and my partner. But I totally relate to all of these words written right here because that’s exactly how I felt in that relationship. And I’m so thankful he came into my life because he taught me so many things about myself I didn’t know. My heart will always hold a place for him and I know getting over him will take some time.
AnxietyDepression,eysg3si,t3_cy8sci,1567397018.0,"This is EXACTLY how I feel. I have been feeling like this for months now. Like I know there’s something wrong with me but it doesn’t feel real enough. Like the panic attacks don’t feel real enough and all of the tears don’t feel real enough. And I mostly feel like this because others make me feel like my feelings aren’t valid and instead of understanding my feelings and taking them into consideration they take it lightly and push them aside. I feel guilty and like I am just making up excuses up for myself. But I am thankful that I have a therapist and a few people which I wish were my parents, that actually understand me. Sadly my family doesn’t understand stand me and I sometimes feel like I don’t fit in with them, to be honest."
depression,eys8fx7,t3_cyekdj,1567390159.0,I totally understand you. Like people think it’s wrong to feel depressed and that you should just hide your feelings and pretend that you’re fine when you’re actually not. There are some people in this world that are comfortable in their own sadness. And it’s okay to feel your pain once in a while and that is something this generation does not understand. It’s like we’re forced to hide our feelings because it’s considered “weak” and show a fake smile instead.
AnxietyDepression,exsdj1a,t3_cu68ka,1566540998.0,"Thats exactly how I felt at first bc I thought that they were going to lock me up but after she asked me if I had any suicidal thoughts or had attempted to commuted suicide I admitted to her that yes I’ve had them in the past and honestly she was very understanding about it.

They’re trained to listen and deal with things like these. Don’t be afraid to tell her about it."
Christians,exsdbpp,t3_cu91pm,1566540811.0,I hope God listens to your prayers and it’s able to help you out. I wish you the best.
AnxietyDepression,exsd5f6,t3_cu5yt4,1566540642.0,I understand what you’re going through. I wish I was able to explain to my family how I feel and everything I carry in my heart and chest and how sometimes I just want to die. But I’m actually attending therapy and it’s actually helping a little. Maybe you should try therapy but first inform your primary care doctor about this.
