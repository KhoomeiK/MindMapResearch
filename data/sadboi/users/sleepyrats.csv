I hired an elopement specialist (I can pm you her website if you are interested, I HIGHLY recommend it) and she walked me through the process. We also did a separate quick registration in my country of residence, which was just the legal side, then did the symbolic vows and everything in Japan. It was honestly great doing it this way once we adjusted to the idea. My wedding photos and vows and ring exchange all happened in Japan, so in my mind that means we eloped there, even though I legally married outside of it.

Unless you absolutely NEED to have the legal side done in Japan, I'd advise you to just sort that out in your own country first. The paperwork that needs to be done alone (everything must be duplicated and officially translated into Japanese to be processed by the Japanese government) is a total pain in the arse. Once you're in Japan and your ceremony is happening, having a legal piece of paper means absolutely nothing compared to the spiritual ceremony."

But I don't talk about that in therapy because it's a distraction from the direct trauma I have experienced, and as I'm unable to stop the world from being sexist, it would just be depressing and overly political. Yes, it is important, but is it helping me face my past to get angry at something I can't directly change right now?

TalkTherapy,fn5tfto,t3_fzq5e0,1586675277.0,"Yes, having bad sessions is inevitable when you're in long term therapy... But the level of ""bad"" depends. 

Firstly, you should feel like you can talk about this with your therapist. If you're afraid of their reaction over a certain subject (and it isn't connected to a learned fear from trauma) then that's a red flag. Ideally, you should be comfortable enough in your working relationship that you're able to work through it. If the T is not willing to work on the issue then that usually means they have their own countertransference that is getting in the way of the therapy.

Secondly, it depends on the nature of the issue. Say for example, the issue that makes the T uncomfortable is something that is inappropriate, such as breaking the law or acting in a way that is threatening to others, then the T will rightly react in a way to steer you away from that. Not all of the things in therapy are meant to be ""heard"" and supported. Sometimes clients can do dangerous things, right?

I never took it for granted, but always found it a little bit... I don't know... indulgent? Like at one point I thought he might be scheduling me around his lunch breaks so he could spend more time with me. He always said that he was in charge of that boundary, and if we ran over then it wasn't anything for me to worry about and he felt I could use that time. It just seemed really kind since I have been going through a lot recently, but now that I think about it, that's probably a massive CT signal as well.

I will heed your advice and try to be more professional with him. And I really hope he takes the hint! Thank you so much"

He's actually from the US whilst I'm from the UK, and we both live overseas, so it makes sense that he's maybe panicking and wanting to talk to someone about how the US is handling the virus. There's a much smaller community of English-speaking people to talk to here, so I'm guessing it was a moment of weakness on his part.

I really appreciate this advice."

TalkTherapy,flgfphx,t3_fnbot0,1585141426.0,"So I had a really weird session today, and thought I might share with others because googling this is an absolute bitch and doesn't give any decent results.

Did anyone else ever just have a ""chat"" session?

My therapist and I get along like a house on fire. We have a really similar style of thinking, I've wrestled with some tough transference (and he's let his own CT slip out a few times), but generally our working relationship is extremely powerful and he has been able to help me beyond any other therapist I've seen - I've had 4  long term and 3 short term before him. I've even written on here numerous times about how much I love him etc., because I can't believe how effective therapy can be with the right T.

Anyway, so I've been going through some serious shit recently. Parent almost died, country in political chaos, huge family drama around me eloping, intense depression, losing my job, and now Covid-fuckin'19. I also have a long history of childhood traumas, drug abuse and a very dysfunctional family. Needless to say every therapy session has been full of insight and we have been working HARD at this stuff for a while now.

So anyway, I had my session this afternoon and my brain was just like ""nope, not today"". I told my T that this virus has been amplifying my anxiety to the point where I can barely think, and we tried to plow through with some stuff but I just couldn't do it. We tried some relaxation techniques, which really helped, but my brain wasn't allowing me to concentrate and was just pinging. So we just spent the rest of the session chatting about TV shows and movies we had seen recently, some politics and predictions about the virus (that weren't panic-inducing). It was like a good 40 mins of just chatting as friends.

A part of me is annoyed at myself, because that was a pretty expensive chat, and I don't want to ""waste"" my sessions... but another part of me feels absolutely refreshed by it. I know next week it will be back to business - I can't afford it not to be - but like... does this count as therapy too? And did anyone else have a session like this ever?

At the end of the session I told my T that he's not allowed to get this virus and he let out a loud laugh. But I'm serious - and to all other T's, we need you so much right now! Please stay safe!"
TalkTherapy,fld0q3l,t3_fo3qn0,1585053358.0,"I'm sorry for all that you've been through, and its great that you've found a therapist who you feel so connected to... but like you said, there are some huge ethical things here that honestly, I think you need to talk about with your T as candidly as possible. 

Should find a new one? I actually have no idea, since your T has been very professional with you. She may be able to help you work with these feelings. You should tell her how you feel regardless of the issue of her losing her license. If she says ""well, lets do it then"", and you know that you have to wait 5 years and are both willing to do that then... humans must be human sometimes. (Obviously you seem informed of abusive T relationships, and the ethics surrounding that, so I won't give you the lecture here - you seem sensible and well informed)

My main concern here is actually where you're getting these signals that she is interested in you as more than a client. In your post you wrote that she said that 1) you guys have developed an emotional connection since you've been working together for more so long, and 2) she's never developed a relationship with a client like she has with you. Is there any more? These could really easily be interpreted as non-romantic and innocent, and I don't really see her putting herself out there apart from what you say you have detected with your own intuition."

TalkTherapy,fl9j1j5,t3_fnb239,1584957968.0,"Idealising transference definitely does not mean you're a narcissist!!!

I can see where you got that though, as the internet has a really strange set of results that crop up from googling ""idealising transference"". From my own limited experience with Google, idealising transference comes from a branch of romantic and parental transference, in which you unconsciously place this person on a pedestal and assume they know everything and have all the answers, like a profound mentor/teacher who will show you ""the way"" and has all these secret techniques that can make you complete.

I'd hazard a guess here that you and your T get along really well and possibly have similar thinking patterns or a similar life experience that makes you just click with them subconsciously. This can be super beneficial for your own healing, and hopefully you can trust that your therapist really knows where you're coming from (it may be that they seem to understand you more than they understand your SO in sessions).

I don't really have much advice on what to do next because I'm not a therapist, but I think this is a really positive sign for you, and it could be that they would work better for you individually. Transference is a really weird thing, and for some people this type of connection can lead to profound healing. For others it can get obsessive and lead to dodgy boundaries and worse. I'd suggest you get individual therapy with a different T, then use that as a way to explore this transference in a healthy way. Maybe you'd end up better off with a new marriage counselor, and make this one your individual T later on? Who knows what's best, but it's totally worth exploring."

TalkTherapy,fl3mreg,t3_fmc9kr,1584791083.0,"Hello! I think problematic behaviour would be stuff like escalation of attempts to connect or contact.

Stalking is a big one (online, then hanging outside the office, then following them home)

Calling constantly in a crisis more days than not during the week/month (this meaning 'crisis' that the patient subconsciously creates to test the therapists level of caring - not actual unlucky circumstances that are outside of normal behaviour)

Using aggressively flirtatious and coquettish language or trying to make excuses to ""touch"" the therapist (brushing hands, leaning in suggestively, bedroom eyes, very graphic and sexual language that isn't exactly necessary for therapy - meaning ""he fucked me so hard last night"" which is very aggressive Vs ""we slept together yesterday"" which is more factual and less tantalising)

I'd even say gifts as well. The odd gift is fine, but bringing more and more gifts to sessions ""because it reminded me of my T and thought they'd like it"" can be an escalation. This one is a harder boundary to draw because some people are just wired that way and cultures differ in what's acceptable too. Say an older lady makes their therapist cookies or you've had a tough time and want to give a card to your T. I'd say that's alright as long as both parties understand that it's just an expression of gratitude and human connection. That would be completely different to buying your T expensive jewelry or writing love notes about how special they are and how much they've saved you every week/month.

I hope this clears things up, and I'm preemptively sorry if I've offended anyone - I think all of these things are normal and/or acceptable in the right circumstances, but can be problematic if they're a new or escalating behaviour."

I also want to say you're not always wrong, and I'm really sorry I made you feel misunderstood and frustrated. I wasn't trying to shame you and I can feel how painful this must be for you. It reads like you're (metaphorically) begging him to connect but he's apathetic and sending weird mixed signals.

TalkTherapy,fl2yzg7,t3_flml6c,1584763716.0,"So I've been to numerous therapists over the years. Basically, you come in and lay out your life story. What are you currently facing? Is this a recurring pattern? Can we tie all these together with a lesson you learned as a child? How can we reorganize those thoughts so that your thinking is more healthy now?

It takes me maybe 4 weeks to start feeling like I'm getting somewhere. Along the way you'll get some feedback within each therapy hour. Maybe some insights from an objective standpoint, or an observation you hadn't made about yourself yet. If you feel like it's true and is connecting with you, then you've found a decent therapist!

Then after around 2 months you'll have some sort of blockage or breakthrough with your therapist and you either continue (if you have good rapport and talking about your issues is working well for you) or find someone new.

This can be some kind of transference or countertransference. I had one therapist tell me I have to like my mum even though she's emotionally abusive. Turns out that therapist has a great mum, and her sister died when she was a child, so she put that on me and tried to make me feel guilty for not wanting a relationship with my own. Another time I had a therapist who was younger than me, much prettier and skinnier at the time too. I felt like she embodied all of the things I was bullied about as a teen, so I couldn't trust her and acted pretty badly towards her. I hated myself so much at that time, so it was really hard to accept that she might want to genuinely help me.

On the positive side of things, sometimes you meet a therapist who you feel is on your side and doesn't judge you for the choices you made along the way. Then you reveal something that you're ashamed of and they go ""hey, that's totally reasonable and I get why you did that"". And bam just like that you're in a great theraputic relationship and you can keep revealing more about yourself and get over some of your past. Sometimes life gets in the way and you have to quit though, which can really suck when you're making progress.

There's more ins and outs, homework, therapy styles, treatment stages etc., but hopefully that clears up the concept of therapy."

TalkTherapy,fl2t0lb,t1_fl2k29e,1584759147.0,"It's quite interesting that you need your therapist to ""give"" to you and make themselves vulnerable so that you feel like you can open up. Your therapist is probably not expressing himself clearly enough, and the rejection wasn't handled very consistently and delicately, but this is a one-way relationship. If he is vulnerable with you then it muddies the waters.

I think you should be more explicit in that you are not ready to open up but you want to, and ask him to try and meet you half way. If you're bringing your own ideas on how you want to be treated into therapy without being explicit about why you feel you need these approaches, then you're setting yourself up for confusing mindgames and rejection.

This is probably not what you wanted to hear, but that's what stands out to me just from these two replies in this thread."
