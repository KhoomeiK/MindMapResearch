BipolarReddit,fd2mbi9,t1_fd23vfw,1578149259.0,Thanks for sharing post! I would have never thought that what I was hearing could be linked to bipolar OR lamictal. I just thought it was something in my head I made up when I tried to sleep!

Almost kind there is a concert happening a few miles away. And it’s not ever a song or a melody that I’ve ever heard. I just thought it was kind of like a “lullaby”. 

Not sure what your cocktail is but I’m on 100mg lamictal."

If you’re asking about side effects, my lamictal and lexapro made me tired so I do 25mg of lamictal in the morning and 75mg of lamictal and 20mg of lexapro at night. They make me pee a lot so I don’t drink water after 5pm."
bipolar,f1w6x4g,t3_daxx4d,1569781046.0,Mine was AWFUL (I partially blame the PA I saw when my doctor was out). I was sleeping 11+ hours a day and couldn’t stay awake at work. It made me more depressed because I physically couldn’t stay up past 7pm and was missing out on fun with my friends like trivia. She then UPPED my dosage after I called and told her that. I also told her I was taking caffeine pills to stay awake and she basically said to tough it out for 2 months. After about a month I stopped taking it and had awful withdraws.
