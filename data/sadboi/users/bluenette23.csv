How my story played out, if you’re curious:

I was born when my sister was 27. She grew up relatively poor in an abusive dad//single mom household. I grew up in a middle//upper-middle class, two-parent household. My mother did everything she possibly could for her (catholic school, state college, let her live rent-free with us until she was 30, buy her nice clothes, etc), but it could never have been the stable and healthy environment I had. She practically raised me, we were so incredibly close. When we told her I was going to go to a prep school (and my family’s economic situation got better after the Recession), she cut us out. I haven’t spoken to her or her two children in over 6 years. We think it was because of jealousy."

AMA,fljylrw,t3_fp0rta,1585229996.0,"Hey, if it makes you feel better, it turns out that if you don’t form that inherent “incest blech” response with a family member (often because you didn’t know they were a relative, as in your case), you’re evolutionarily driven to find them attractive. We want to pass on as many of our genes as possible, and if someone is similar to you, they probably have similar genes, and you’re more inclined to want to mate with them. This effect is obviously ramped up when you actually share ~25% of your genes. So it isn’t your fault per se that you guys found each other attractive.

StonerPhilosophy,flagqt7,t3_fnmh4q,1584983547.0,"Viruses aren’t alive. They are little pieces of RNA (or DNA, but corona is RNA) in a little protein capsule. Once the RNA gets into a cell by bumping into it, the enzymes that translate our own RNA bump into the virus. The enzymes read the RNA and create another enzyme that replicates the virus. Then a bunch of copies are made, and the cell freaks out and kills itself, resulting in the spread of those viruses out to other cells. 

So viruses aren’t choosing to spread. They just spread by virtue of what they are"
mentalhealth,fl89fsj,t1_fl7xbjs,1584918678.0,"To the last question about the admissions office - I would probably call the financial aid office. Financial aid offices are in chaos rn because of all the schools being shuttered and all the students that need to be reimbursed, but hopefully you can get through to someone who will listen. As I said, especially because you are an honors student, they will hopefully be compassionate. In addition, financial aid packages are often re-evaluated during the year in the event of a parental layoff. You aren’t asking for something unheard of, especially in times like this. 

I think guys that haven’t gone through hell just won’t get it. My bf likewise doesn’t “get” a lot of what I talk about, and will be clear about that. It sucks but I guess he’s lucky? 

Those girls at school seem like absolute bitches (hopefully I’m allowed to say that? Mods please don’t ban me), I’ve had to deal with a lot of people like that too because like you I fall at the very top of my class. I’m an outcast from the “smart” group in my major too. It hurts like hell, ik, but this year (my junior year of college) I finally realized that I’m better off. You don’t want to be friends with people like that, even if that makes you lonely in the short to medium term. Especially in college, you’ll be able to find other smart yet not evil people. It took me until my junior year to really find my group, but it will happen for you, too. 

Idk how close you are to your boxing team, but maybe pick one to open up to? My therapist taught me that, if I’m afraid to tell someone something, then I should imagine how I would react if a friend told me the same thing. If a friend told me what you’ve revealed in your post, I wouldn’t think less of them. In fact, I would regard them a little higher because I recognize how strong they are to have gotten through that. I don’t think my reaction is abnormal, either."

Do you have any girl friends at school that know what’s going on? Anyone whom you can lean on? What your mother is doing - dismissing your feelings as invalid - is wrong, and I know how hard that can be to live through because my mother dismisses my bad feelings as well. 

I don’t know which college you’re talking about, but you can 100% go to college no matter what happens financially. You can go to the financial aid office and explain what’s going on. You will not be the only person in this recession boat, and there are plenty of loans and grants available to get you through. In addition, they’re more likely to look favorably on you because you’re in the honors program."

My dad likewise has a compromised immune system, so we’ve been looking up every drug he takes and seeing what doctors in Wuhan say about it. For instance, he shouldn’t take ibuprofen, because it hinders recovery, but acetaminophen is fine. 

OP, the only thing I can say is that if you’re not in Italy or Iran, the hospitals are not overwhelmed yet. If things get bad, he can likely still access a ventilator and all of that stuff. These doctors and nurses are absolutely amazing and there is definitely reason to have hope that he can survive this. I really hope that everything turns out alright for you and your dad."

My nephew will go to the ER and get an IV on antiemetic in order to stop the vomiting, I know it isn’t cheap but it may be worth it to stop an episode in its tracks.

She clearly wants to live vicariously through you because she didn’t get to fulfill her dreams. She sees you as what she could have been, and you throwing all of that away to her is an immense betrayal. There’s really not much you can do here. I doubt she’s going to budge or even recognize what she’s doing and how unfair it is. 

I think the only way you can get out of this is to find a new passion that takes the place of dance. Going to medical school, becoming a nurse, a lawyer, idk something. Something equally admirable where you can’t do both. Or maybe theater or music. She might be able to let it go if she sees you’re doing something that brings you immense joy. 

Where is your father in all of this? He might be able to reason with her.
