nottingham,flaoe6s,t1_fl9nepu,1584987885.0,"Absolutely no arguments there. Happy to donate because I know it‚Äôs going to the frontline professionals that need it, but the fact that we have to because there‚Äôs no support through normal channels is ridiculous."
instantpot,fl2a06s,t1_fl2894v,1584746274.0,Thanks!
instantpot,fl29zj4,t1_fl27dxg,1584746262.0,"Thanks! Not much of a baker normally, but this one‚Äôs a real winner"
instantpot,fl29xla,t1_fl27a0i,1584746228.0,"Absolutely! Use the Yoghurt function to proof the dough for a few hours, then in the oven for ~35 minutes (25 covered, 10 uncovered).

Not a ‚Äòpure‚Äô Instant Pot bake (although I‚Äôm sure you could), but the recipe I found is so easy and the wife loves it so much that I haven‚Äôt really experimented with it yet:

Made it a few times now though - really simple and always a winner. Great while working at home too; mostly set it and leave it!"
PokemonSwordAndShield,fj1cpgu,t1_fj0t7pi,1582917342.0,"Same and same (although I was the Marshadow in my raid). Crazy the amount of coordination/past game Pokemon seemingly required for this.

At least it doesn‚Äôt have Recover..."
aww,fiwzoqw,t1_fiwvdsv,1582808738.0,Kitty Cafe Nottingham! Great place üò∫
PokemonSwordAndShield,fhzmav3,t3_f5h50e,1582003630.0,I can‚Äôt choose between true ninja Greninja and the royalty of Aegislash! Both awesome shinies
PokemonSwordAndShield,fgliolh,t3_eyxoc2,1580899751.0,"Watch out for ‚ÄúTina‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù  - just traded the Rhydon I‚Äôd spent ages breeding for, called it TRADEBACKPLS, and they quit right after. So disheartened."
AskReddit,ffhp1qf,t1_ffgb137,1579946281.0,"How am I over 30 and this is the first time anyone‚Äôs ever explained it to me this way?

Mind utterly blown. Thanks, internet stranger!"
Borderlands,ezpmvg6,t3_d1rc6q,1568043793.0,"I didn‚Äôt think I could actually get more hyped. But this did it. Well played, Gearbox."
depression,eyo0hpk,t1_eylfe6o,1567266627.0,"Great to hear you‚Äôre going to get the support you need! It took me 15 years (I‚Äôm 30) to accept that a) I needed help and b) that there was help out there, but it‚Äôs no different to any physical injury - you break your leg, you go to the doctor and you take time off work to heal. If I hadn‚Äôt, I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be here today."
depression,eyo02yj,t1_eykqkzp,1567266352.0,"I think it depends on the person and the job. Like anything else, what works for one person doesn‚Äôt necessarily work for another. I really enjoy my job, and my sister (who also has depression and also took a period of time off following OH advice) does too, and we‚Äôve both really benefited from it.
Please don‚Äôt take that last step though. There are better things out there, jobs where you can feel valued and fulfilled. It took me a little time to find one, but wanting to be back at my job is helping give me a goal to get better sooner."
AmItheAsshole,eykjiue,t3_cx82jo,1567155063.0,"NTA. Seriously, sounds like she has some issues herself if that‚Äôs where her mind goes, knowing what the two of you have been through."
depression,eykj585,t3_cxbnat,1567154463.0,"I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I‚Äôd spent years thinking that everyone felt that way, and it wasn‚Äôt until I had several breakdowns at work that I finally saw my GP. They wanted to sign me off work, but I fought it for a while because I felt guilty at the thought of being at home for something that‚Äôs ‚Äúall in my head‚Äù. Had a really bad breakdown, work referred me to Occupational Health, and they finally convinced me to accepted being signed off.

Started counselling shortly afterwards, and I now realise that I‚Äôd been ill for a long time. I still feel guilty at being off work, but I‚Äôm slowly accepting that mental health is no different to physical health; you need to have time to heal, and pushing it too far or too early is just going to end with you getting hurt."
