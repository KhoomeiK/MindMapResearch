Debatable. Also think logistics and purpose. Like, biologically there are certain animals a human couldn't sleep with. (size differences) Purpose. Just to get off? I say stick to sleeping with ""those"" who can give consent. To hunt, capture, kill, and eat: I'd go back to purpose. (ie food source). Overall, just... why??? (lol) Like, why sleep with what you eat. 

It's true that many taboos are ""socialized"" but I think we did well on the bestiality taboo. 

>Equal (or superior) in terms of physical strength and resilience and thought/processing speed. But cranes are stronger than people. Computers process faster than humans. Even calculators have ""memory"". But cranes, computers, calculators, and hosts (somewhat a combination of crane, computer, and calculator) are not human.

But calculators, cranes, and computers lack **humanity**. Hosts don't. Why? The emotional component. ...and here's why we start arguing about what it means to be human (lol). 

>They may be able to surpass human performance, display an approximation of human emotion, and even appear human, but they are not human. In an unaware state, it's basically a toaster with hands. A piece of machinery. It's as morally wrong to have sex with an unaware host as it would be morally wrong to have sex with a vibrator...

From here I think where our ideas clash isn't semantics but definitive. We have two different ideas of **What it means to be equal to a human regarding non-humans** Even though Hosts would be superior to us, I'd still expect ""equal respect"" from them and vis versa for them even if it's not something we **have** to do I believe it's something that **should** be done. Basically trying to get a net positive effect for all parties involved, but not everyone agrees.

This has been a truly rare and interesting internet conversation :) (I think I'm done for today lol) Also, if you're really into the sci-fi theme of ""ai vs human"", you might like these other series: Almost Human (less dark than WW but introduces some interesting themes), Humans (2015 series. Probably most like WW in maturity not as dark for most part), and Detroit: Become Human (if you're a gamer lol)."
westworld,fhbsz49,t1_fhbg493,1581449230.0,">By that definition, you're using a person you're dating with the intention of building a mutually beneficial relationship. When you have sex, you're ""using"" each other for an orgasm.

Not necessarily, I wouldn't define a person as ""something"". I used that definition because the host are non-human. However, I am arguing for their ""humanity"" so it may have been better if I used the word ""abuse"". (but now we're talking semantics)

>Holy shit, this is a fascinating conversation!

You can say that again lol
  
>I also wouldn't sleep with an animal. However, I don't think there's anything the matter with sleeping with an animal.

I don't believe it's morally permissible to sleep with an animal. (It's like I'm taking an philosophy course all over again :v) 

>All that's fine. But it's a huge problem if you fuck an animal? That makes NO sense to me.
>So...now, I wouldn't fuck an animal, but I wouldn't have a problem if someone did.

When it comes the domestication and abuse of animals. Humans have been doing so since the dawn of time. The degrees of human-animal interaction varies from culture to culture. I don't agree with abusing animals (such as having sex with one or the typical treatment they receive in mega farms, buy your local farm raised/Amish); however, I think there's a difference in training an animal and abusing one. Yes, we (humans) use animals as a means to an end but it's **how** we use/interact with them. That's what matters. (This is huge rabbit hole conversation though lol)

>This is a hard argument to have, because it's a work of fiction and we have no idea what the emotional capacity of an unawakened host is. I read it as them displaying emotions, where an awakened host would experience emotions.

I guess that's the brilliant part of this show! We get to see the hosts point of view which (I hope) helps us empathize with them. Here's my thesis (lol): The hosts are equals to humans in both their aware/unaware states. Since we know they have the **capability/potential to give consent**, why ""use"" them when they can't voice it in their unaware state? Recall, that the hosts keep their memories from their unaware state. 

We could go on and on about the differences of an unaware host (displaying emotions) and an aware host (experiencing emotions), but those emotions/memories of an unaware host become **real** once they are aware. Knowing this, I can't justify having sex (an action that should be done only with consent) with an unaware host, because their programming is what gives me permission not them. 

But hey, we're talking about hot fictional androids so I get the sentiment lol

Edit: format/grammar"
westworld,fhbd8ln,t1_fhbahpk,1581439890.0,"1) Use. I‚Äôm thinking the dictionary definition. ‚ÄúTake, hold, or deploy (something) as a means of accomplishing a purpose or achieving a result; employ.‚Äù

2) How can a host give consent if it‚Äôs not aware? That‚Äôs part of my whole point. This is vulgar example but I think of it like this: Animals are not humans. They don‚Äôt have the same level of intellect/awareness as humans but some would argue their emotional capability is par to humans. I‚Äôd argue that hosts (initially) lack awareness (although they also have capability for it) but have the same emotional capability as humans in their initial unaware state. If I wouldn‚Äôt sleep with an animal, why a host? Because it‚Äôs similar in appearance to humans? Because it‚Äôs made of inorganic materials? That‚Äôs not enough cause for me especially considering their potential. 

3) You‚Äôre right cheating varies person to person, relationship to relationship. However if you‚Äôre in a relationship, there needs to be a basis established of what cheating is and acknowledgement."
