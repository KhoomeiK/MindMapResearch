I have personally found subtle ways to hint at it, and the people who want it will pick up on it and respond, and people who don’t will shy away and you’ll notice.i feel kind of weird describing these but maybe they will help you haha

One way to do this is to start to (slowly) increase the length or the closeness of your hugs, and notice if it makes them awkward and pull away or if they reciprocate. Try to keep he hug going while you keep talking and see if they are comfortable like that or want to pull away.

Another one that I do is start to walk next to the person but maybe a little closer than normal.. “accidentally” bumping into them a little. If the person wouldn’t mind cuddles or holding hands, they won’t move away and may even make a move. If they don’t like it, they’ll automatically move away as if you bumped them by accident.

The thing is, you really can’t know until you just try. Sometimes it’s the ones who are the least touchy and affectionate that actually end up as the best cuddle friends. They are probably just used to stifling it, just like you. Best!"

I personally can’t wrap my head around the concept of nudes, and that is related to my sexuality.

Every human goes through seasons in their lives and will change over time, but just because change is possible in the future doesn’t make their current truth any less real.

Phase implies that there is a “neutral” or “normal” state to return to,and everything else that deviates is just a passing whim. But that’s now what’s humans are like. I think our life is more like a spectrum and each individual is everything they have been AND everything they will be.

As you said, many things in your life will be seasons, but many will not, and you can’t know which is which until you’ve crossed the bridge. And none of us are guaranteed the time to see any of that pan out anyway. So it’s important to respect everyone’s truth as it exists now."

like I would find a meme they would like and send it, bring up a funny memory you share, or ask them something specific and thoughtful about how an interview went, how their health is issue is doing, how their classes are going, etc.

Of course if you really need help, ask for it, but I find that I can come off way to needy and I push people away when I contact them expecting them to comfort me over too many little things. It’s better to turn the focus away from myself and just try to be a good friend to them. You just have to commit to NOT forcing the conversation and being ok with it being brief and not too deep.

Sometimes, the interaction will turn into something deeper and you’ll have the chance to vent anyway, but if not, you’re still building those connections and hopefully feeling less lonely. Best to you!"

As tragic and heartbreaking as the whole thing is, being that needy is kind of toxic and you can’t build a stable relationship on it. No matter how kind or reassuring Steven was, she would have always been insecure and he would have always been walking on eggshells to not upset her. 

And even though it’s not really her fault for being so needy and sensitive, feeding into it doesn’t cure it. Steven helped her through the rough patch, but she has to learn to be ok on her own.

Eyebleach,f35jpjq,t1_f34q45d,1570679693.0,"I literally said this EXACT sentence out loud to myself when I saw the picture, then opened up the comments to find this one right on top. Coincidence?!?!"
asexuality,f35jf5y,t1_f35ixhl,1570679442.0,"Yeah, I thought that too... Only one person had a “gay” response and he’s a very bold, open and flamboyant person. I was wondering who may have played it safe and just chose someone of the opposite sex even if they didn’t mean it."
asexuality,f35j83c,t1_f35g997,1570679271.0,"I understand aesthetic attraction too but not with celebrities... I mean, I don’t know them. So why I would I be “attracted” to them? When I’m “attracted” to a friend or person irl, it’s their looks, but also their style, their attitude, and their “energy”. 

I guess if I REALLY think about it, I could tell you some people from movies that I like aesthetically... but everyone else seems to have a whole list right on the top of their tongue."
socialanxiety,f356t6v,t3_dfmz4t,1570669858.0,Ouch. At least I know I’m not alone
stevenuniverse,f30rn8v,t1_f30mwbj,1570560909.0,"Yeah, it’s a common shape on earth as well... and possibly it’s something that initially caught rose’s eye. Like there’s all these humans that are kind of the same but this one has a symbol familiar to her."
stevenuniverse,f305a12,t3_dexxp1,1570546721.0,Omg! I just had a flashback of playing outside as a kid and finding “dirt clods”. They were basically like rocks but made completely of dirt. You could throw them and they break apart or explode. I totally forgot they were called clods until just now.
gaming,f2uqfhh,t3_de79wq,1570424721.0, Thought the buttons on the R were legos. Just spent way too long contemplating why they’d use legos inside of a gameboy.
AskReddit,f2sia9m,t1_f2s14h1,1570383327.0,omg yes! the croutons were a special event
AskReddit,f2p8u04,t1_f2mzby5,1570339304.0,"Why is your childhood salad so familiar. I believe my parents had the same recipe. Though theirs often had chunks of radish tossed in for pizazz. 

For the longest time, as a kid, I actually thought that iceberg was the only lettuce that existed. It was almost like other greens and other types of salad were just being discovered or invented as I got older. It’s so weird that they always existed and I just didn’t know."
stevenuniverse,f2p5cl8,t1_f2p2xhq,1570337824.0,"Which I think in itself is one of SU’s lessons... Like that IS how we come to know people. We get to know who they are NOW and what they choose to show us. Then their pasts and faults are revealed later, and maybe out of order or out of context.  

It’s up to us whether we let the past taint the present, or whether we take the whole person into account and decide if that person’s “good” still makes them worthy of time, devotion or love."
LifeProTips,f2lbvpo,t3_ddm9g8,1570293573.0,"Nah I ask because I’m interested, and because I want to get a conversation started. I’m hoping they will then ask a different question, or keep talking so we can get on a topic. 

When someone just keeps saying “what about you?”, it feels like a stock answer. Like they’re just responding to be polite.

Sometimes it’s appropriate, like if I ask what you’re doing this weekend. But don’t just keep saying “what about you?” to everything because that’s not building a conversation, that’s just quizzing each other lol"
aaaaaaacccccccce,f2ktlwe,t3_ddi5i4,1570289127.0,Hahaha killer ace vibes
Eyebleach,f2hv9nc,t3_ddg4jb,1570248692.0,"I witnessed someone take a tumble down one. Not a particularly old or seemingly handicapped person either. She was “stuck” at the bottom, as the continued motion made her continue to “fall” /tumble. It was scary.

Someone who was nearer and got there faster rushed in and helped. She was fine, just very shaken and dinged up."
stevenuniverse,f2fun4k,t1_f2fr04c,1570222984.0,It might alarm you...
socialskills,f2evc2f,t3_dd5gzs,1570204662.0,"If you want... it’s not too late! Text or Facebook people you know and tell them you forgot to plan something. See if they want to go to dinner or a movie tonight, or come over for a game night. Or, tell them you want to plan it for next weekend. 

I’ve noticed that people are pretty happy to celebrate birthdays, and actually feel special for being involved. I haven’t celebrated my bday in a long time and have had some horrible birthdays, but next time, I’m planning to tell the friends I have that I want to celebrate.

I used to think I had to wait for others to want to celebrate with me, but honestly, I’ve realized that most people plan their own birthdays and then other people jump in. Pick the people you like and just go for it!"
asexuality,f2eu82f,t1_f2dh2gu,1570204063.0,Honestly... same I think. At least we can find each other here on reddit but where are we in real life??
