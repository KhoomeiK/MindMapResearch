bipolar,fgyjq0h,t3_f0sx18,1581184045.0,I am literally going through the process right now. Learned a few things. DM me and I'll tell you about it.
bipolar,fgyipsa,t1_fgygg03,1581183743.0,"Sounds good. Weigh the pros and cons. I'm almost 40 and my life is really good. Not everybody would want my life but I'm married with two kids and have a great job making good money.

My buddy once told me if I didn't make some of the choices I did that I'd be divorced, broke and barking at trees. I'm certain there is a very good chance I wouldn't even be alive if I didn't decide to make it a priority."
bipolar,fgyghtp,t3_f0qsfd,1581183167.0,I've been stable for five years now. I remember the transition from racy and manic was almost boring. I missed the intensity and eventually came to realize how nice it is to be able to manage and focus on my life. It gets easier and better. Now if I elevate it feels very uncomfortable and I do what I'm supposed to in order to knock that down.
bipolar,fgyfnk4,t1_fgxqo29,1581182895.0,"The rash only happens if you're not properly transitioned onto it and take too much. I would expect your doctor has prepared you and has a schedule for you. I was prescribed the ""official"" onboarding pill packs.

fwiw. I'm on 350mg and haven't had any considerable side effects. I'm grateful for the medication - I put in a lot be of work and it keeps me very stable. My dose is 350mg. 

I do better not drinking on it though. My memory isn't as good as it once was, but that isn't documented as a side effect and could be just getting old or post manic bipolar brain."
bipolar,fglovdt,t3_ez612v,1580906747.0,I'm BP II. Been on lamictal as my primary medication for close to five years. (Since I was diagnosed). I'm grateful for it.
bipolar,fdqaros,t1_fdq45vq,1578661428.0,"It triggers mania for me - including racy thoughts when I'm on it and my stability after. Usually when I'm tempted to use weed to temper high irritability, anxiety or sensitivities to light & sound, I'm better off using my prescription for Klonopin (which I only use occasionally).

Weed apparently works for some people and is awful for others. Be aware of the amount too - it's effectiveness can disappate and require more for the same impact. Before my diagnosis I was a heavy user. Turns out I was self medicating. My use got heavier and heavier (basically high all day) until I had a four day manic episode resulting in my diagnosis. My meds are much more reliable."
bipolar,fdpoica,t3_emjfhx,1578634679.0,Weed exasperates my symptoms.
2meirl4meirl,f6ozckh,t3_ds5mqd,1573042214.0,"Hey. I don't know if you're joking or not but I'll share anyway just in case it will help somebody.

 I went through a bad long term depression years back. I had a small deal with myself that if I wasn't better by my birthday I would end it. In my head I picked a day and a way. That's scary shit. I told someone and they helped me find a counselor and eventually a psychiatrist. Glad I did. After awhile I started feeling normal and enjoying things again. Now I'm still around for my family who, it turns out, really needs me."
bipolar,eyqhjzg,t3_cy4uvf,1567343295.0,The app indeed second every day might be useful. Plus the video it makes would look kind of cool. https://1se.co/
bipolar,eyqgkkh,t3_cy78mw,1567342276.0,"The issue with bipolar is the episodes can become more severe over time. It's easier to get under control early than later. Unfortunately the disorder is chronic and doesn't go away.... But it can be managed with healthy habits and medication.

Smoking weed while on an SSRI can trigger mania - so it's a good idea to stop doing that. But other things can trigger it too - like stress, relationships, events, sleep or routine changes. Be sure to watch out for other triggers and swings. 

My bipolar feels like it came over night - a switch went off and I'm different forever. For me, there is a ""me before my first manic episode"" and ""me after my first manic episode"". My BD manifested itself after a combination of things which included  lots of weed, an SSRI, and significant work stress, family stress, and marital stress. (Even though my weed and SSRI may have contributed to my BD, I don't like to blame it on myself that way. So instead of ""I changed my brain chemistry"" I prefer to about that ""my brain wiring and chemistry changed"".)

For what it's worth, I'm on lamictal, and after a lot work I've been very stable for at least 4 years. Managing successful job, kids and marriage.

I'm curious about your resistance to medication. Do you think you have bipolar disorder? Do you intend to continue smoking weed but off of an SSRI?"
bipolar,ewg893e,t3_co31tn,1565376087.0,Truth. I've come to a point where I accept it - resign to it happening and wait it out. But I've got an understanding wife who picks up the burden when I'm down for the count.
sales,erveoxy,t3_c3olfj,1561313837.0,"I had a similar issue with last company. Ended up using Amazon's mturk to pare it down. Incredibly fast and inexpensive for the quantity. 

Sucks to you have to pay for it out of pocket, but it you'll ROI on commission while you convince Marketing to take care of it for you."
bipolar,erizenj,t3_c2841b,1560911354.0,"So frustrating. This is why almost no one in my life knows I'm BP. If someone finds out suddenly have on the ""he's BP"" glasses and it's all they see.

I'm sure most would be *shocked* to find out. I've pulled off a lot of cool sh!t and have an created an objectively good life for myself and family."
bipolar,erixktl,t3_c2a96g,1560909953.0,Well executed. Keep 'em coming! ðŸ™‚
bipolar,epduyqx,t1_epcwaw0,1559174441.0,Oh lordy. That question is why next to no one knows I've got bipolar disorder.
