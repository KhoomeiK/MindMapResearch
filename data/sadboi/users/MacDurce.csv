To make this worse he is the worst housemate ever. 

Would buy loads of food every time he left the house, never use any of it so we just had rotting food everywhere. 
Smelled really bad like sweaty gym socks, never opened the window to the guest room and I had to have the carpet specially cleaned when he left. 
Slammed the door so hard every day that it broke And I had to get a locksmith.
Left dishes with food uncovered in the fridge till they got mouldy and I had to throw them out.
Left smelly damp clothes in the washing machine for days so the whole house smelled like damp.
Shit stains on the toilet.
Muddy footprints on the floor 
When I asked him to please clean things he would try to gaslight me and tell me it wasn‚Äôt him and call me hitler and say my house was like 1984. 
Got coffee grounds fucking everywhere it drove me completely insane, the floors the walls everywhere.
And never paid a drop of rent or utilities not fucking once.

Feeling like a woman is realizing and losing your innocence way before your time when you notice your body is a commodity and something men want to take and abuse.

sex,f4qnk82,t3_dlgpil,1571755733.0,"I had a similar relationship with my previous bf. He denied watching porn despite me having no issue. I found it on his laptop and tried to tease him and he freaked. It wasn‚Äôt even anything off the wall it was very standard porn. I never quite felt right, the sex was technically good, he put me in lots of positions and stayed hard and always came but I never felt like there was any intimacy or connection, he wouldn‚Äôt do any of my fantasies and told me he had none.  Etc etc.

He ended up breaking up with me and I met my current SO just after and genuinely, I‚Äôm so glad I don‚Äôt have to suffer through that anymore. I look forward to sex now, even if I‚Äôm not particularly horny, just for the connection, he barely has to touch me and I cum. He does everything he can to get me off, any fantasy, any position. We are both submissive but we both switch. 

The issue isn‚Äôt just sexual compatibility (which is so important) but about him listening to you and trying to fulfill your needs. The emotional connection, the intimacy, the trust and communication needed for good sex is integral to a relationship.

Life is too short for bad sex. I would cut your losses and move on."
