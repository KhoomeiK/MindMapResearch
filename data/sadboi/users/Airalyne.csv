You kept saying that, so it’s obvious you do to some extent think it’s their fault. You addressed that about rape, not the messages. 

I still say that just because they seek for attention doesn’t mean they ask for the unsolicited dms and harassment. Crying rape is something I’m against fully, that is for certain. Whilst I still disapprove of those kind of comments, I was thinking along the lines of fully nude photos on reddit or and far more severe comments. Regardless I don’t think the dms and messages are any better simply because it’s involving adolescents. It also still proves a point that they can say something and hope for a change, regardless if it’s just for attention. It can at least ensure that it’ll be less likely to happen again. While they might think with their dicks according to you, they still got a brain to take a hint. 

If you allow harassment and creepy comments under the guise of boys will be boys and men think with their dicks, who knows where you draw the line next.

unpopularopinion,fhguwzr,t1_fhgtuzi,1581580220.0,"I never equated it to first world problems, but your views on promiscuity and modesty reminds me of first world views. Doing such things probably don’t make people uncomfortable, it’s those comments that follow. 

If we’re talking about those people “who do not care”, I doubt they would give two shits in regards of what actions I do to prevent myself from getting hurt. 

You keep saying you don’t hold women responsible, and yet you keep saying they “could’ve” done this or “could’ve” done that. Don’t beat around bush, you do that they’re partly at fault for it. 

The whole thing about thinking with their dick is just a whole lot of toxic masculinity. If the second they see a naked picture they’re gonna go jacked on their dicks, they’re gonna have trouble staying with any women, much less a “modest” woman. 

Also regarding respect, posting a picture of themselves does not automatically equate to not having self respect. Just like “men are capable of loving a modest women”, women are capable of flaunting themselves while still having dignity and self respect. In retrospect if that’s all you think self respect and dignity is worth, that’s pathetic. Boys will be boys is just a whole lot of bull to justify disrespect. 

I’ll also end the discussion because I don’t wish to bother with someone whose solutions and mindset is that of medieval ages. Cover up and don’t provoke men and they won’t rape and harass you, other than that you’re doing it to yourself. Men are men, what do you expect, self restraint and common self and judgement? they think with their dicks.

You find it annoying, but aren’t they just trying to stop these creepy comments? Instead of them stopping what they feel like doing, showing off what they want to, why not just straight up say and address the creepy comments, or how you phrase it “complain”. 

Also what the fuck is looking horny, I see plenty of bikini pics and not once I think, wow shit she looks horny. Yes, I can blame him because unless she for real says that shit, there is no meaning. If it’s friendly approach sure, that’s different from creepy, a difference of “Hey, I saw you on Instagram and just wanted to chat” and “Damn your pictures are hella sexy, bet you’re horny and ready fuck”.

unpopularopinion,fhgs7dv,t1_fhgq7z3,1581576993.0,"So you are indeed saying that I am at least partly at fault regarding it... from what you wrote in the post and the comment it’s clearly what your implying to some extent.

I don’t believe people should be posting naked pictures either, not because of creepy people, but more just privacy and kinda using their brains. 

Creepy attention is really different from creepy dms and stalking. You say that just “you give off an impression that somethings are acceptable”, that’s literally the old conservative thinking. Giving off an impression does not equate to jack shit, “oh she seems like a whore with that dress so I bet she’ll like if I squeeze her ass” is the kind of “impressions” people get and the actions they think are “acceptable”.

Also if they don’t like the comments and dms, why must they stop? Why can’t the comments and dms stop after she complained and asked them to stop? Before you say she started it, well she has ended it now, so I would think those people who are “capable of loving a modest woman” are also capable of respecting someone’s request to stop dming her. 

You’re right, the world is filled with bad people, but if world is filled with bad people, that does not mean that I have to hide and fear all of them. It also does not mean I need to accept that they’re bad and their actions are bad and it is what it is."

Those actions are responsible by the people who feel affected by the images, not the person who post the image. They were the ones who followed through with creepy dms afterwards, the images did not force their hands to do it. If that really were the case then there would be thousands of dms with every picture. 

I doll myself up pretty for the public, maybe it’s sexy and provocative. I know people will find it sexy, and it’ll cause feelings of lust, I’m responsible for that. But I’m not responsible between someone’s decision to whether respectfully ask for my number or act on those impulses to drug or sexually assault me."

You say you don’t blame rape victims, but this is the same exact argument that people use. Except in this case of clothing it’s pictures and posts, and instead of sexual assault it’s creepy dms. 

I get what you mean when you say that they know that people will feel horny and aroused by their naked images, but does that also come with the package of creepy dms? Feeling an emotion is one thing and acting out on it is another, feeling horny from a naked pictures is one thing, sending creepy dms and stalking after is another.

I wear a dress knowing people will find it sexy and appealing is one thing, them raping me because I wore this dress despite knowing people will find it arousing is another."

MensRights,fh3tcph,t1_fh2e2g2,1581272083.0,"I think these incidents are far more common than what you would expect, I’ve seen them around a lot, and I’ve been around a lot of places. Perhaps you don’t hang around the same shitty alleys I do, but alas they’re there, even if you don’t see them. And in terms of both things, can you really make a fair judgement until you’ve felt it. 

I meant third world countries in the sense that there are places where women are shamed and whipped for not wearing the right clothes and raped for showing skin. I wouldn’t even call that equality, I would call that treating humans and human beings. Because of fear that men would end up badly, should we just ignore it all, let them suffer because we don’t want to? 

There probably is bias there, but I do think that there is the same amount of bullshit in MRAs and feminists. Especially walking around these subs and hearing it endlessly, they seem more obvious and irritating. 

People don’t go to the police because of many reasons, they don’t want to be judged and ostracized, they don’t want everyone to know, the persons someone they know and it’s hard to come out about it. Did you know that almost all rape victims knew their rapist? Did you know a good 1/3 are family members, just like in my case? I’ve talked to rape victims myself, talked to them as they consoled me while I consoled them, and I can guarantee you it’s more than “why don’t just go to the police in the first place?”. 

And trust me, you’re not the first or last to ask that question. I’ve fought and argued with people who just pushed me to go to the police, but it really isn’t that simple. I don’t think you think it really is that simple either. The emotional strain and shock is something you can’t really understand until you’ve felt it. 

You’re right, the conversation has gone for too long. I don’t really want to continue it anymore either, but I wanted to tell you that I think you’re unwilling to admit your sides faults. Rather then unwilling, I think you just don’t wish to see them. I think perhaps like me, you’ve been hurt in the past, but it’s not my right to know. But you’re like me, I can see your words and thoughts like a reflection of my past self. I know it’s hard, it’s always hard to see all the dirtiness in the world, but eventually you’ll have to face them. And I think they’re both cuts, and without treatment they’ll both get infected. 

And with that I end this conversation, it was pleasant talking to you. Perhaps not all our points agreed, but it was a wonderful talk nonetheless. I won’t lie this sub does give me empathy for men, especially since I haven’t fully moved from my demonization of men. It’s a slow drawn out journey, and I’m not quite sure I’m gonna make it through. But if I die I’ll kill myself knowing that it’s wicked people that has pushed me there, not just men and whatnot. Anyways, enjoy the rest of your day, I hope all will be pleasant to you."

MensRights,fh1ooww,t1_fgzi1b5,1581219819.0,"It’s hard going to the cops for something that has happened in the past, at least in your cases of not coming out until years later. Like if I were to come out about my past incidents, I would have little to no backing, hence why there would be no reason for me to go to cops. Also, I was talking about my personal case when I was talking about ruining families. 

MRAs sometimes tick me off because like feminism they generalize the entire gender into one box, granted it’s not all of them, but it is a lot. Each sides seems to always be shaming the opposite gender, being male or female doesn’t mean anything, being an asshole does. I can understand why it happens, it’s in me sometimes, a bad instinct whenever a man approaches me, but regardless of my empathy, I cannot respect it. 

I’m assuming you didn’t want to disrespect me when you chose to ignore my comments about being treated badly. I don’t think feminism is unneeded, neither do I think that about the men’s right movement. There is plenty of sexism against both sides today, some places it’s more serious than the other, but it exists nonetheless.

I say this as a female who grew up wishing I was a boy so I could be treated as leniently and be as loved as my brother. Wishing that perhaps if I was a boy I would have been able to avoid all the trauma that has befallen on me. My case may have been my family being traditional and just terrible circumstances, but it still stands. Outside of my family I’ve been bombarded with woman jokes and ridiculed for liking pretty things. Been approached by people who wanted nothing more but to see my pictures. I doubt you and the men’s right movement would associate with those kind of people, but that does not change the fact that they still exist. 

I don’t say this to say that your points are entirely wrong, but I don’t think that feminism is unnecessary, especially in places where women are treated like dirt. Sure there are people who take it out of proportions, but like I’ve said, I personally would not disregard an entire movement because of people who can’t act right, after all, they’re everywhere. I also don’t think it’s a contest of who needs it more and whose worse than the other, two people who has gotten shot will both need treatment, they shouldn’t be fighting each other to see who gets treated first."

Ive came to realize that comes with a price that many from both sides are unwilling to give. It frustrates me to no ends, which is why I don’t really identify as a feminist. Regardless of roots or history, i don’t think the movement in itself is inherently wrong. History and the past is one big stain on everyone, and that goes for both genders. I care much more when people do stupid shit in the name of fighting sexism now. 

I won’t lie, feminism ticks me off endlessly, but the same thing goes with menism? How ever you say it. But I can understand that good comes out from both. I’ve spend a lot of my life loathing being female, even now I get shit for being a woman and liking girly things. I know, unreal, and I won’t lie that sometimes those “female empowerment” posts helps me cope. I can imagine the same for men and this sub, and other women with feminism. 

People come out convenient times and circumstances because there really wasn’t a way to come out, there was no push. I don’t reveal my past because I don’t wish to ruin my family, but I can tell you how much loathing I have when I see them succeed and live a good life as if nothing has happened. That’s why I can imagine people coming out at those “convenient” times. 

I do also hope that men are being taken more seriously, hell, I wish everyone can be taken more seriously. I hope the day does come soon when we can all just respect each other regardless of gender, race or whatnot.

MensRights,fgtu4ji,t1_fgs2w8z,1581109359.0,"I still think MeToo is a good movement. Also, what may not seem like harassment to you is to another, we do not decide what someone else feels about something. I usually don’t see anyone really discredit anyone, there is more good than bad in my opinion, so even if there is, they usually get drowned out. There are asshole still, but overall as a society we have made a move to being more sensitive about those matters, I wouldn’t disagree that I would expect more men to be discredited. It’s a matter of gender stereotypes and construct, perhaps in the far future it’ll be different.

Saying that it reeked of a victim mentality is something that can be applied to every movement, I see that here and I see it on feminism pages, should I say this sub is all just senseless as well. I do feel like there are times feminism does a lot of good, and times where it doesn’t do enough or too much. I don’t really think that  the stated goal was a lie at all, I think it’s just there are those who twist the it to their preferences, and note the fact it happens here on this sub often as well. 

The MeToo movement to me will always be a beautiful movement, it has its stains here and there, but celebrities, both male and female, giving some light to others is beautiful to me. 

And regarding your comment on recent sexual abuse. I think it doesn’t matter, abuse is abuse, and it stains like oil. I was fucked from age six to about maybe twelve or thirteen, and it really hits now what had happened to me. I struggle to come to terms with it and move on.  have to also force myself to not fall into a misandristic mindset about men because of it. I don’t think time heals all wounds, I suppose it differs from person to person, but so what it’s thirty years ago, time cannot change what has happened, it will always be there regardless of whether you want to look at it or not.

If MenToo becomes big and helps a lot of people that’ll be great, I hope those people can find some peace with what has happened in their pasts. I also hope when that time comes I hope you’ll support all of them, regardless if it happened thirty or a year ago."

It’s not wrong to wish for someone without a traumatic past, it’s for the best usually, for both you and your partner.

I do definitely agree it’s such a small part, I know it depends on the situation, but I think over all it shouldn’t be such a big deal. Like me being bi doesn’t define who I am, bi is not a personality trait, it’s not a characteristic. It’s not a book, I’m not a character who is bi for the sake of being bi.

I definitely think your relationships are going to be dead either way if sex is the only thing driving it. That’s why people commit most adultery, cause their relationship was driving on sex, and once that runs out, there’s no feeling to keep it going. I’ve seen plenty of good looking men, I don’t immediately go damn I’m wet, the same way you see a model and you don’t immediately get a boner and feel the drive to fuck, or you do, who knows how men work.

Physical attraction is definitely important, but it can’t be the only thing that drives attraction, or else no one would be attracted to each other when they’re old. I honestly you think everything is about fuck fuck fuck, I said it before, but the most relationship isn’t immediately, bang bang bang, there’s the moments that lead up to it, you’re thinking a girlfriend as a glorified fuckbuddy, and it’s more complicated than that.

You keep saying sub-8, do you really think all the married couples with healthy relationships are consist of 10 rated men?

In fact I just saw in women of reddit? some subreddit where women all say they prefer being friends with their lovers before fuck buddies, and I would trust actual people on reddit over your statistics. 

I’ve always questioned the point in sexuality as well, I remember arguing with my brother how gender doesn’t matter in a relationship unless that shit is all about fucking. Are the only couples you see consisted of average women and super hot guys?

You also act as if your statistics can justify every women, sure I suppose they come from people, but have you taken a look around you and see that not every women is dating a celebrity. My dad is not a buff dude, neither is my uncle, they’re still together far more then the tinder hook up relationships you envy. Speaking of those, how long do they even last, because I doubt a fuck is enough to build a relationship.

Instead of showing me statistics how about you, you seem to be bitter about the women all lusting over hot guys out of their leagues, how about you? I found it funny you targeted my Justin Bieber example, I used him as the standard Chad, but my preferences are more towards the Asian side. 

Personality does matter, even if you show me those links of few individuals. Even in middle school there are girls smart enough to reject cute guys because they know their douchey personalities, yet you like to give me your cherry picked articles. 

You also act as if women can’t have preferred like men, what do men usually like in their ideal looking girlfriend? Tiddies and butts, or otherwise in case they’re a pedo, and I mean ideal. My ideal body for a men is fit but not buff, my ideal body for myself is skinny, ideals are ideals though, you see ugly people married, and you see fat people married, where did they go wrong. 

You seem to keep denying real life and instead shoving articles like they describe everyone. The same way the guy before said there are guys dating girls out of their league that he has seen before, the same way I can confirm I’ve seen it plenty as well, and you simply shut him down with it’s not attraction because it simply, isn’t.

Cause it’s literally none of my fucking business, I don’t know what they’re going through? I literally just saw a reddit post about a magazine “judging” an actor for being disheveled, the man has suffered from addiction and depression. 

I’ve played games to cope with my depression because I have no other way to resort to that’s not crying and self harm. Sometimes my bitchy attitude comes through because I’m on the verge of a breakdown, and I hear “judgement” about me being an asshole.
