It's almost criminal. I wish I had all of this input before I started taking gabs; no doctor warned me about withdrawals, and none of my friends showed any concern until today. I'm starting the tapering process ASAP; the high definitely isn't worth the low anymore."
gabagoodness,fqd7uc3,t1_fqctapr,1589282639.0,"> CHASING THE HIGH IS A WASTE! Once your tolerance goes up you should cut your dose WAY down until your tolerance lowers.5-7 days is enough for me. Trying to keep getting high with a big tolerance ...well you might as well get some Pez.And you've wasted your supply.

I needed to hear this! I think for so long I kept telling myself ""it's not scheduled, it's an amazingly safe drug, I can't get addicted"" and eventually found myself at the opposite end of the latter two. It's not safe and I am addicted. I was also afraid of mentioning any of this to my doctor because I didn't want to be put on a list or have my script taken away from me, which also sounds a little insane after admitting it.

Thanks so much for the input, I'll talk to my doc about it and start being more honest with myself."
