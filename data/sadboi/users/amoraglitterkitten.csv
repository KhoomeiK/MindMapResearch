But in my case, I've been trying to not rage so hard against my own father for what he has done to me. 
So yeah, I tell myself he didn't mean to.
But deep down do I believe it? 
I'm not sure. üòû"

The professor in my abnormal psych class, she had encouraged us to voice our mental health issues to her in online assignments (between us privately). Earlier on in the semester I had broke down my own history to her, though referring to anorexia in the past tense (despite it not being so). So I can kind of relate. I know she was just doing her job, but the way she talked about eating disorders offended me--as well as how she let the class be so judgmental. She was my favorite professor up until that lesson."

BPDmemes,fkcngim,t3_fhjzml,1584056878.0,"Sometimes I've resorted to replying with superficial information (major, what others may call achievements, etc.). BUT that can often lead to oversharing when prodded or under the influence. And then I obsess over how stupid I was.  
Other times, I've made a complete fool out of myself and sat there awkwardly in silence, until stammering out vague replies. And then I obsess over how stupid I was.  
There is no winning."
