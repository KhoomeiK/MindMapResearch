news,fefevse,t1_feev4q7,1579054850.0,Hey I’ve been in your position and understand your current mindset. Don’t be afraid to reach out and talk to someone not even necessarily a therapist just speaking your thoughts can help. It really sucks being unhappy and you don’t realize how miserable you are and that things don’t have to be this way until you do something about it. Be strong.

nba,f3vveyz,t1_f3vuumc,1571185718.0,"That’s fact any NBA player or even coach could have that impact let alone the most prominent player of this decade dubbed as the king. It’s a tough situation all around, but overall one that I think we’re all on the same side in that we all wish to see justice for the protesters in Hong Kong."
nba,f3vumo6,t1_f3vu1lg,1571185206.0,"I completely agree. It’s near impossible to speak up on an issue like this when so much is at stake, but like kellerman said Mohamed Ali took a stand in which he lost everything and LeBron chose to protect his assets. I just think that James could have worded what he said a lot better especially making a comment 10 or 11 days after the tweet."
nba,f3vtoio,t1_f3vsdl9,1571184559.0,"You believe that censoring yourself in regards to a facist government is mundane in a capitalist society? LeBron also not only demeaned Morey for his comments, while being uneducated himself, and said he should have remained silent for factors affecting others (Lebron’s money in China) but even went as far as to stand up for China as well. I think your point is valid when it comes to people selling out in our society for a check, but not everyone signing their rights away is speaking up for a government that is killing their people in the streets."
