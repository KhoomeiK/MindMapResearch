death,fqkv0dz,t3_g6jyqr,1589437077.0,I just left a comment on my dead fifth grade teachers obituary. She was a horrible person and her actions should have put her in prison. If only parents knew what really goes on in school. It sickens me to know she was so well respected in her community and her church.
selfhelp,fkjdgu5,t1_f6ysaaf,1584242787.0,Probably not. They dont like serious discussions so I just keep to myself
SuicideWatch,fkjd97p,t1_fjz6f2t,1584242620.0,Multiple therapists. Basically they all said to go out more and join clubs or engage in more hobbies. But I have hobbies and am tired of always going out alone. I don't feel like any counselor Ive seen has ever really been able to offer more than a listening ear
Anxiety,f6upo65,t3_dswusn,1573166201.0,What type of setting is this teaching position? Ive lived with depression and anxiety for many years and im considering getting my masters in mental health counseling
