See a therapist. Consider CBT. Talk about possible medication options. You can work through this, it's your mind tricking you in the end.

If you are in the middle of a legit panic attack focus on your breathing. I know everyone says this but it can help. Breath in slowly through your mouth, and then breath out *EXTREMELY* slowly out your nose. You should feel your breath moving across your philtrum (area above your upper lip). Do this a couple of times. These should be DEEP breaths down into your belly. Feel your stomach expand, this allows for the bottom part of your lungs to fill with air, which they do not during an attack when you feel very short of breath.

After or before trying to focus on the soles of your feet. Feel the pressure from the ground pushing back on them. Convince yourself that there are branches coming out of your feet into the ground. Literally ground yourself like a tree, and keep breathing."

Xan is chemically a little less potent than clonazepam (Klonopin), however, the halflife is way, way less. Alprazolam ""hits"" you with more of a ""buzz.""

As with any med (especially a benzo), you will gain a tolerance and will need more and more. Eventually, it too will just make you sleepy.

I always enjoyed alprazolam, but got addicted to a relatively low dose (3mg/day) and luckily quit. It was fun while it lasted, though.
