depression,fjox3g8,t3_feh19t,1583536660.0,"I've had conflicting experiences with this. On one hand depression can distort your perception of other people who may actually care, but on the other being a martyr for narcissistic people will make you depressed. My life was a mix of both and it took effort to quit wasting my time on certain relationships (family, old friends, job, etc).

Someone I know feels like no one cares about her, and her friends always move on from the friendship. She is depressed but also very manipulative, needy, and self centered. This ends up driving people away. One of her friends was very sick, worked full time, and had two kids... her perception was that the friend wasn't there for her. It sounded unbelievable, but it was too WTF to be a joke.

In the end everyone has to do some introspection and figure out why they feel a certain way and whether or not its reality or perception. You don't owe people anything and they don't owe you."
depression,fjbpljv,t3_dxy4qp,1583198633.0,"I wouldn't say lazy because this kind of sounds like how I get when I'm depressed:

1) I lose motivation in part because I lose the feeling of reward by accomplishing things. Even on some level when I know I 'enjoy' something it is blunted by the depression. Then I kind of end up doing a bunch of nothing and quit seeking to do things I normally do.

2) My perception of time gets weird because it feels like my brain is running slow. When my brain is running half speed, life seems twice as fast. It becomes overwhelming.

3) I don't have the energy to do what I normally can do. People will say that I am lazy or whatever... but I basically pour whatever I have into my work to keep a roof over my head and then sleep.

I ended up getting on meds for a bit and it helped."

The FB group rule violated was about body shaming people, although the muted and banned members were just saying that he should use some lotion on his obviously dry and cracked skin. One person (not the person in the photo) was triggered and no one else acted as though it was an overreach. These dominant non-political FB groups with leftist rules and enforcement are an insidious form of indoctrination.

After watching a lot of videos from Sargon and the like, it seems like answer is that the government allows it to continue and prevents people from speaking up.

So how do these people stay in power? Or is there just a large percentage of woke people voting for them who are okay with 19k kids being exploited because its more important to be politically correct or do they not know because they don't have access to actual information? is it the queen and the house of lords?

Free speech alternatives to popular social media platforms are a great idea in theory but in reality they just turn into cesspools that could never be mainstream.

Why hasn't anyone created a simple platform that just has rules that are uniformly enforced and doesn't have a clear bias?

Maybe the markets have decided and people want a site that pushes that stuff."

Talking to someone who can't understand what you went through causes them distress because they are helpless in finding a resolution- for the most part people kinda care and will try regardless. They probably just saw a Reddit post about it and humans have a compulsion to share information.

I simply keep it to myself, a very small circle of trusted people, and professionals. I quit talking about what happened to me and how it effects my day to day life to pretty much everyone.
