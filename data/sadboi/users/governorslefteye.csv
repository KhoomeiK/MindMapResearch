theshining,fiv8zat,t3_fa0i3x,1582756078.0,"I think Kubrick's version of The Shining and King's disdain for it can be summed up by the fact that in marketing, it's ""Stanley Kubrick's The Shining"" while almost every other adaptation is ""Stephen King's XYZ."" King resented Kubrick not using the screenplay he offered him, he resented any and all changes, and imo it's because he's completely divorced from it. Obviously it's based on his book, but it's a Kubrick film, as opposed to a King film, which is why it feels the most distinct of the King adaptations. A real auteur made it."

It's called Autism SPECTRUM Disorder for a reason. One autist being able to do something doesn't mean shit about the rest. Take another spectrum for example: light. Your statement is the equivalent of saying ""some light is visible, therefore all light is visible.""

And that's not even opening the can of worms that is not all mentalcels are autistic. Technically speaking it's not even a mental illness, but a neurodevelopmental irregularity, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt because functionally, it is."
