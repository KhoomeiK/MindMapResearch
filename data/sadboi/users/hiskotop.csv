But I don't believe that this is the way the world thinks. So many people rely on these primitive urges to disown or strike people down just because they don't agree with them. 

My source of self hate doesn't come from myself as much as it does from others. I am capable of accepting myself, but it seems like the world is incapable of doing so.

Telling a pre-t trans man that he has too feminine of a face to pass as a man is like telling a 10 year old boy that his face is too feminine to pass as a man.

I would let my brother go by himself but I feel like it's more dangerous for him to be alone with my dad than not with my dad at all. Also, I've tried explaining it to my brother but I think he's still too young to understand everything right now. Every time I try to talk about it he denies it. I know that I'm crazy but this is the one thing that I \*know\* i'm not delusional about. 

Anyways, even if I never saw my dad again I would still have all the other shit that I'm going through. I can't live on my own, I have no friends or family that I can trust, I have extreme social anxiety and I'm a trans guy living in a homophobic town just to name a few.

I would love to take some time off but the last time I tried doing that it made my depression worse because my family wouldn't stop calling me lazy."
Psychosis,f3qacq6,t1_f3q5eri,1571071911.0,"I'm pretty sure I already know the sources of my stress. I know a few ways that I can cut down on my stress too. The problem is that I feel like I have a responsibility to keep pushing through it. 

I'll give you an example- Me and my brother drive twice a month to my dads house a few cites away. The whole reason that we go is so that my brother can have a relationship with his dad, which is an important thing for a kid of his age to have. The only problem is that my dad is a master manipulator and has anti social personality disorder. So my brother thinks that my dad loves and cares for him, when in reality, my dad is only using him (and me) to get what he wants. This is very distressing for me mentally. But, if I stop driving my brother it could damage him mentally and also give my dad a reason to resent us.

There is a ton of dilemmas like this that i'm dealing with right now, and it's definitely something that is worsening my anxiety. So, do I live with the guilt of taking care of myself at the cost of other people being hurt, or do I suffer for as long as I can?

I’ve thought about just committing myself into a mental hospital again, but I have too many responsibilities now and I don’t want to throw debt into it.
