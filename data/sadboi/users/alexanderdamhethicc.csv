i mean if we’re gonna go off what’s realistic, her chin is too pointy, her eyes are too big, the skin isn’t detailed to the pore, like where do you draw the line? it’s just style my guy it’s not SUPPOSED to be be realism unless the style they’re going for is realism.

the pose she’s in is well within the bounds of human limitations, the understanding of the rules of anatomy is clearly there (it’s just overly exaggerated because it’s CLEARLY an erotic drawing), they choose to draw that way. just because it’s not an art style you like doesn’t mean it’s suddenly bad and wrong lmfao

relationships,ez95io5,t3_d0d9ws,1567773599.0,"I know I’m only 22 and therefore have little experience, but I learned just a year ago how painful it is to be cheated on and lied to. You’re probably going through a whirlwind of emotions, which is totally expected, but you NEED to know that once the storm settles you’re going to be left with deep scars that he won’t be able to fix - ever. 

Compared to your story and the stories of many others in this thread, my experience was very mild, and yet over a year later I’m still deeply sad and disgusted by it, even though the feelings for my ex are (thankfully) long fucking gone. 

Your husband, and all other cheaters like him, are the bottom of the barrel. He won’t learn, he won’t change, he’s only sorry that he’s an idiot and let you catch him. If you stay with him, you’ll always be second best to his selfish desires. The fact that you have no intention to leave is super troubling, because staying with him will only worsen his actions against you. 

For the love of everything, fucking leave while you have the chance. Don’t delude yourself into thinking he actually gives a shit about what he did. Chances are he’ll do what he wants while you suffer, THEN when he finds something he wants more than you, he’ll leave - just like my ex partner did to me. Luckily you and I haven’t sunk in as much time and effort as we COULD have (even though it’s still too damn much, imo) and can build entire lives with people more deserving.

Your only options are to stay, knowing you’re just a trophy wife, or to go. I guarantee you he will only cheat again, because he knows you’ll let him get away with it."

otomegames,er8nfgx,t3_c0pwp4,1560608162.0,"unfortunately despite loving otome games/aesthetic/art i don’t end up liking many of them. i wish there were more that i could enjoy but i can’t stand how they make most of the MCs - pacifist, submissive, plain, dull characters who for no real reason garner the attention of 10933838327 hot guys. despite being a fan of otome i dislike more games than i like lol

psychedelica of the black butterfly is a game i just tried to play but i could barely get through the prologue, i don’t think i even did? not only is the MC everything described above, but the art looks weird and gross in some instances, and when i click it doesn’t register for some reason? there’s also the charming empire... please. 

i feel so spoilt after coming from Steam Prison, which is probably now my all time favourite otome game. the MC is competent, headstrong, and the attraction is all justified. there are defs things about her i wish were different but compared to 90% of otome MCs out there she’s practically a war goddess. also Fashioning Little Miss Lonesome, the MC is hilarious and i love how tall she is & that she’s taller than the sadistic love interest 

anyway my bad i just used this as an excuse to rant abt otome MCs lmfao. tldr i find it incredibly hard to enjoy most games because of the MCs which is frustrating bc i like most everything else about them"

not gonna sugarcoat it bud, she ended up cheating/leaving when i was insanely depressed and barely reacted when i was in the hospital afterwards. relationships like this are ultimately worse for you, and tbh if ur anything like me it’ll still affect you a lot after the breakup.

i know u don’t wanna break up, u want it to work out, u don’t wanna hear this, but truthfully unless a miracle happens she won’t change. u probably won’t break up with her, she’ll be the one who dumps u and then you’ll have to deal with the sadness on ur own. the aftermath will suck a lot for a long time, but honestly i’m so relieved and so happy that i’m not with my ex anymore because she made me miserable, i only thought she made me happy bc i loved her but after getting distance i realised i was rarely ever happy with her.
