askscience,fm6fwna,t3_ft12pb,1585793161.0,"They are called ‚Äúcarriers‚Äù. 

Ex: Latent tuberculosis can live dormant in your lungs. If you have latent tuberculosis, and is left untreated ‚Äì if in the future you were to contract diabetes or perhaps cancer, the tuberculosis will most likely become active immediately and it will kill you faster then either of the diabetes or the cancer. In this case, the susceptible a.k.a. at risk patients are those who have latent tuberculosis and are also carriers of the disease. This case is a bit different because according to science, latent tuberculosis is not spread until it becomes active. I just wanted to give an example. 

The difference here is that with SARS-2 (COVID-19) Those who are asymptomatic but our positive our carriers that will spread the disease. So let‚Äôs just say someone with latent tuberculosis is around someone with asymptomatic COVID-19, this person being more at risk could die from a combination of complications from active tuberculosis and COVID-19. This stands true for people who have cancer, diabetes, underlying heart disease, lupus etc.

Once it has a person with a weak immune system, as mentioned above, the chances of this person being able to combat the pathogen on their own is slim to none. This is why a ventilator shortage is such a huge problem. A ventilator may keep these type of people alive long enough for medications to help strengthen their immune system, albeit temporary. 

Hope this helps."

Tuberculosis,fk0qvts,t1_fjzkzv5,1583764095.0,How do you figure this is true? I was treated for latent TB with a full isoniazid treatment and realize I will always be PPD positive (skin test positive) but my quantiferon gold blood test should always be negative. It showed positive a few months ago and I was quarantined in the emergency room until cleared by a chest X-ray. The department of public health is following my check up bloodwork this week. After my isoniazid treatment I was left with weak kidneys and residual damage to my lungs. I am a heavy asthmatic and see a pulmonologist. I don‚Äôt know this persons case but anyone with lung issues should take precautions although there‚Äôs NO NEED TO PANIC. That goes for everyone. But definitely think about how your case/health has been after your INH treatment to determine susceptibility OP.
