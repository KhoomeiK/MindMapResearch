depression,fc0ifsu,t3_effx75,1577291545.0,I felt this. Hang in there. I know it’s easier said then done
depression,fbkr3zu,t1_fbkhtlz,1576954411.0,I wish. I just want to be okay believe me I do. I wish I didn’t worry about everything. I really wish my now ex would just take me back. I’m 20 years old and never really been a bad kid or anything. The only time I feel even a bit of okay is when I’m drunk
depression,fbah6x6,t1_fbafoah,1576678068.0,Well I’m calmed down for right now. I don’t believe that I will be seeking help from anyone. But just kind of getting it off of my chest sort of helped. I really do appreciate your time. I’m happy you replied to my post.
depression,fbaej0p,t1_fbae4ik,1576675878.0,That is very well true. But I lack the motivation to stay in school now. I don’t even feel hungry. I just want to be okay. I’m sick of the constant crying and my head hurting.  I think that I am too much for some people. I have really bad attachment issues. And feeling ignored is destroying me.
depression,fbad923,t1_fbactl8,1576674736.0,"The only reason I’m on here is because I don’t want my loved ones to know how bad my depression is. This is a throwaway acct with no trace to my identity is the only reason that I will talk ab the matter. I get that improving myself would be my best interest. But I don’t want to. It’s selfish of me to say it, but I just want to die. I can’t imagine what my family or even close friends will go through. But sadly, life goes on. They will get over it. 

And another reason that I’m on here is that it’s out of a last resort. I want interaction without having physical interaction."
depression,fbacx5b,t1_fbacq1x,1576674421.0,Yeah I wish I can do that. It’s sad to say it but I saw a future with this girl and never thought of if we broke up. My plans for my future just go dark. It was never meant to not have this girl in it. And I know this is kind of selfish. But it’s what I want. I honestly don’t think that I will last long.
depression,fbacftb,t1_fbac50l,1576673965.0,"The thing is, I was doing pretty good at school. I was on the right path towards my career choice. But lately I just feel ignored by the person I want the attn from the most. And when I try to get attn, I’m called “clingy”. Well little does she know is that I think about how much I want to die. That I feel safe in her arms. She’s the only person in my life that I feel safe with. And if she doesn’t want me, than what should I do?? I just don’t want to deal with it. We’ve had a rocky relationship the past couple of months and I am convinced that she doesn’t want to be with me- that it’s me that only wants to be with her."
depression,fb9rynh,t3_ec6i5l,1576647679.0,"Honestly, it sounds like you were thriving and sounds like you hit a bump in the road. Now I’m not going to lie, life is hard. And we get curveballs thrown at us all the time. But don’t let this stop you from moving forward. 

I hope everything ends up being okay with your sibling and mother."
SuicideWatch,fb9pzwl,t1_fb9pnqj,1576645774.0,What makes you happy?
depression,fb9pmx5,t3_ec807g,1576645438.0,At least be safe about it. What will happen if you caught feelings for one of those women?
SuicideWatch,fb9pdf1,t3_e91mp4,1576645191.0,Don’t ever believe that you are alone. There is ppl who will talk to you and love you. You’re life is precious. I will talk to you!
offmychest,f50ne8r,t1_f50ejyb,1571930036.0,I tried to
personalfinance,ez79ijk,t1_ez78iwm,1567720662.0,"Yes the refund is from what is leftover on the federal loans. And I plan to use it to put back towards the loan payment(s). 

Even though I do not have to pay anything until after 6 months after graduating, I want to use the money I make now to try to lessen the interests down the road. 

Anyways, You answered my question. Thank you"
personalfinance,ez77wj5,t1_ez77o7u,1567720057.0,My intention is to try to pay back some of the federal loans with what I am making at work. I want to try to minimize as much interest charges as possible in the future.
