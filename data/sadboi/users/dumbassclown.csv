INTP,fqb25cw,t1_fqazeac,1589229257.0,"agree, as much as I hate my own behaviors and stuff i know that if I want to live a better life I must start with myself first, self awareness is key and the acceptance of our flaws and stuff.

We cant just keep using our flaws as excuses forever, it can be an explanation but not an excuse, although it does take forever for some more than others to shift out of that mindset or to at least finally get motivated, depending on our situations and mental health and stuff. I guess its up to us to decide whether we want to do something or not, either its now or eventually, i cant explain shit lol but i hope yall know more or less where im coming from

the point of finding a root cause or causes is not to make an excuse but to do something about it. If someone finds the root problem, the solution is to find the best ways to cope with it 

well if we want to eventually ig"
INTP,fqb0u8h,t1_fqaytz9,1589228611.0,"I guess they're trying to be motivational but we can't rush progress either, I, myself am not the best at motivating people and have also tried to motivate ppl to change right away and its a long, frustrating progress because I know that we want to make a change and be helpful but I realized i cant rush it either. Everyone changes at their own pace. I realized I hate seeing people suffer but also realized I cant automatically change people either. But at least hope that some of my words stick in a way that may work later, take ur time.

The first step is self awareness and the acceptance of it and the cause of our problems, whether it be our coping mechanisms or emotions, pasts, etc. 

Then sure we can take action but it doesn't mean it's going to automatically transform us in the first day. It takes even years to finally take that step as it has done with me, but knowledge and awareness is key to progressing at least a little bit at a time, at the pace we are good with. I've been aware of my shit for a while but still haven't completely transformed. In nearly four years i've only made a bit of progress but it's better than how I was years ago. 

Any progress is good progress. I knew that if I wanted a better life instead of the shithole I was in that i was going to take at least another step further but like I said, there is no rush either, it may take a while and it's definitely not that easy but hey, no pressure, if we want to improve we will have to take action sooner or later, even if it's years later but its better late than never. Take ur time, bud."

I tell her I didn't cuz I didn't, and if we happened to miss, it still does not mean anyone else should cheat the system

she starts yelling on how said lady is probably my friend and that I let her on purpose

I ask what she looked like in case I did miss, she keeps yelling. I didnt run into any friends as I cashieered, so she's obviously lying

she still gets no extra purchase and gets kicked out by manager
