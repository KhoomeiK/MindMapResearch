Elephant shit would mean like extremely bad or extremely big problem and used similarly .

Dog shit would be a smaller problem but still used similarly . 

Lizard shit would be a weird problem , same with fish shit . 

Cow shit strikes me as funny.

Monkey shit is crazy as well, but high energy crazy .

Bird shit is a small problem that blemishes but is superficial .

Lion shit may not be used, but the Lion of Shits may be a nickname . Also maybe cultural/geographical.

Same with tiger shit not in use, but the King Tiger of Shits is also a potential nickname , meaning this guy takes the King Tiger of Shits. It’s self explanatory. 

Hippopotamus shit may be like elephant shit but worse, since Hippopotamuses are dangerous as fuck.
Also cultural / geographical.

Pig shit seems like it is also used but mainly to describe the smell of actual pig shit.
   

Chicken shit -scaredy pants 

Rat Shit / snake shit = backstabber / snitch 

Cat shit - bad
