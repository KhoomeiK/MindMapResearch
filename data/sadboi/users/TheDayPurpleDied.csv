SuicideWatch,fdontej,t3_eieayu,1578608949.0,"I entered this year torn and broken and alone. I had someone I loved who broke my heart by cheating on me and lying to me and using me for citizenship. It's difficult enough being a gay man in your forties but then to be betrayed by someone you love. I came to the conclusion that this year should be the year that there's no more me. I've lived a shitty life for the most part anyway. Abandoned by my father, disowned by my mother and shunned by my brother. One horrible relationship after another. I've had my arm cut by a knife from one lover and I was thrown in jail because I was a bigger guy than his small frame. Used by a man for citizenship who I loved and all he did was lie and cheat on me and when I confronted him, he lied even more. Then I had my identity stolen only a few months afterwards by someone who I thought was helping me to heal. So I entered 2020 with all the baggage and pain from the previous year. I've looked into a lot of methods to go through with it. In a twisted sense I want the one who broke my heart to be the person who finds me. Call it my sick sense of poetic justice, leave him with the anxiety he caused me. Or maybe it's just morbid, I honestly don't know and frankly don't care. I figured that  the anniversary of or wedding day would be the best day to end it. The day that brought me the most happiness with him should be a day that he should have soiled in my blood. Besides it should fuck up his birthday the following day. So here's to him ðŸ–•."
