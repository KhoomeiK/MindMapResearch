Alcohol has been a huge factor in my life my whole life as my Dad was a ""functioning alcoholic"" and his alcoholism was glorified in my family. My extended family are all ""functioning"" alcoholics too. My BIL's both brew their own beer. I myself was also a heavy drinker starting at 18yo and all through college and many years after. Didnt stop drinking until 5 years ago when got pregnant. I spent 8 years married to a terrible alcoholic who couldn't handle his drinks at all. I had lived the past 2 years with a very terrible alcoholic ""friend"" roommate who was very abusive and I watched her life fall apart and she lost her child which was a direct result of her alcoholism. 
So at this point in my life,  I'm disgusted by alcohol. I used to be that person who relied on it, who had 2 day hangovers,  who went to my restaurant jobs drunk, who made terrible decisions drunk,  and the amount of money spent on alcohol....I could prob buy a house now if I didnt drink it away.

AskDocs,famkz4z,t3_e9mihh,1576206384.0,"So, from my experience working with mentally ill clients (lots of schizophrenic/schizoaffective) I've seen it take time to diagnose someone with schizophrenia. I've also seen it be diagnosed immediately. I'm not a doctor, not even a licensed social worker (getting my masters in it soon) but I have years of experience in the field. 

Just recently, this past week, one of my clients that was med -compliant for months and doing so well and making strides of improvement decided to reveal that he has been off his medications since the end of November. I made an appointment immediately to see his psychiatrist with my client and when we were at the appointment he said he is refusing all meds from now on. He doesn't believe he is schizophrenic. This particular clients history is filled with many different psychotic episodes from going non-compliant with medication. He expresses he hates the medication he is prescribed,  he hates the ""zombie"" effect he gets from it. He has been diagnosed schizophrenic multiple times by multiple doctors. There is no doubt in my mind that he is schizophrenic. I trust his doctors. He is also court ordered to be on medication for his illness and now that his dr knows about his decision to go without meds his dr has to report him to the sheriff and from there (I think) he will eventually be sent to the psych ward again and there the drs and nurses will attempt to medicate him. When he starts to go into psychosis he is paranoid that the government is watching him through the floor boards, electrical outlets, he thinks the sheriff puts acid in his ears and he believes he is bugged through his ears too. This disease is crippling and I absolutley think its (I'm a nerd) fascinating and fucked up all together.  

Anyway,  I'm rambling and could go on forever. But I think you should definitely say something. Be prepared that the dr might ask you to record one of her episodes. 

Good luck, I feel your pain and I know your concern. Thank you for caring and trying to help, also. We mental health professionals appreciate people like you that are supports for those that need it."
