crossfit,fqpwvht,t1_fqo1rbl,1589555450.0,"I can't wear anything off shoulder unless I size up once or twice of what I'd normally wear! 

About two years ago, I was shopping for a dress for a holiday party in a department store. I tried one form-fitting dress on that had a zipper in the back. The fabric had no give, but the dress zipped up comfortably until it got to my mid-back where things start to get a little linebacker-ish for me. I could tell it wasn't going to zip up the rest of the way, so I started to try to take it off and the stupid zipper got stuck. After struggling to get out of the dress, one of the sales ladies came back to check on me. I was SO embarrassed but needed to ask for her help. She tried to unzip what was now starting to feel like sausage casing, but couldn't get the zipper to budge. She told me to wait in the dressing room and she left. A moment later I hear the store's background music cut off and then ""SEAMSTRESS TO LEVEL FOUR, LADIES DRESSING ROOM. SEAMSTRESS TO LEVEL FOUR, LADIES DRESSING ROOM. THANK YOU"" blaring for all to hear. A woman had to come and literally cut me out of that stupid dress with a pair of scissors. To this day, I won't wear anything that isn't stretchy enough to pull over my back and shoulders or down around my hips."

I love the show as a whole so I found myself making excuses up: Jane broke up with Tom and is avoiding Blue Blues, etc. Great TV and writing don't make you do that. 

I still enjoyed season 2 as a whole, the acting's fantastic, the music is great, and the story sucks you in. But it's not the masterpiece that season 1 was. Lol if anything, watch it for Laura Dern's performance/Renata's outbursts."

DecidingToBeBetter,fpx67u9,t1_fpswy7e,1588976438.0,"Your story about the paychecks is SO interesting! I have the same problem! I do contract work that I track hours for. I've caught myself not tracking hours for work that I don't see worth being compensated for that should. I also used to severely discount my hourly rate. When I finally mustered up the confidence to charge a rate that was appropriate, but still competitive with the market, it made me feel SO horrible. 

My conversation with my therapist came up because I've been having a horrible time with the Department of Labor (it's a long story but most of my wages have been cut back due to COVID over the past two months). I feel like I'm doing something immoral by asking for help. In reality, unemployment insurance is meant for people in positions similar to mine right now. And I pay taxes every year, so the fact that I can't shake the feeling of not being worthy of assistance is bizarre. But like I said, I can't shake that feeling. 

We haven't yet gotten into the root of *why* I feel so unworthy of help, but I suspect a lot of it comes from bullying that stretched from elementary to high school. 

I can't imagine how much more difficult it is to navigate these issues as a trans person. When the law doesn't even protect your basic rights, how easy it must be to slip into believing that you're not even worthy of basic human rights and protections. I have a couple of trans friends, and the stories they tell about some of their experiences are truly disgusting. 

Thank you for sharing your story. I wish you the very best of luck with your continued healing and with your boss! Hopefully, it will never come to it, but I'm happy to hear that you're prepared to fight back and protect your job! You seem like a wonderful person!"

Anxiety,fpt9guo,t3_gf7ars,1588887208.0,"I struggle with the same when it comes to both anxiety and depression. While I don’t have any useful advice on how to get your appetite back, I will tell you that keeping softer semi-solid and liquid foods around helps me when I know I need to eat but am too anxious and have lost my appetite. Things like smoothies, soups and yogurt are easier to put down because they don’t take the effort of chewing and take less effort to digest. Also, I’ve found it helpful to pace myself with several small snacks throughout the day versus telling myself I need to eat a large meal. A few big meals can seem like too much, but small portions of food more frequently through the day seems more doable for me. Good luck <3"

If you don’t feel like the psychiatrist you meet with is a good fit, don’t assume that they’re all like that. Don’t be afraid to speak up and ask to meet with someone else if the person they pair you with isn’t a good fit :) 

If you go on medication, also pay attention to how you feel. Some medicines that work for some people don’t work for others. Some of them can give you lousy side effects.

The truth is, just because you are the youngest sibling doesn’t mean at all that everyone is going to die before you. That is definitely not certain. People get sick, get in accidents.... life is really random and chaotic. 

Also, it really sounds like you love and care for your dog. I bet he/she really loves you. We need more people like you on this planet who care for animals like that. I’ll admit, losing a pet is one of the toughest things to go through. You never really “get over it”, although it gets easier as time passes. I hope you can find the strength to keep moving on because, even after your dog dies, there are SO many dogs out there that need a kind person like you to love and take care of them.

I know this sounds really cliche, but it sounds like this dude is dealing with some major insecurities and is taking them out on you, which really fucking sucks. And it sucks that the teachers haven’t helped. Can you talk to your parents for advice? 

How old are you? If you’re close to graduating, take comfort in knowing that you’re never going to have to deal with these people again once you’re done with school. I was bullied in school and have bumped into some of these people after graduating. They always act friendly, because bullies seem to forget how horrible they once were as time passes, and it is so satisfying to walk right past them without acknowledging their existence. They will have NO control over you once you’re out of school. Just a little “light at the end of the tunnel” perspective. 

If you’re still a ways from graduating, I would continue to do your best to brush these people off. Again, it sounds like the cliche solution and I know you said it hasn’t helped helped, but I would try to consistently ignore these people for a little longer. This person sounds like he’s looking for a reaction out of you to take the attention away from whatever issues he’s dealing with his own sexuality. Or if you’re feeling ballsy (and as long as you feel safe doing it... you don’t want these people to physically retaliate in any way) look them in the eye and tell them “actually, I’m confident about my own sexuality, but thanks for your concern” and then walk away."

If no such thing exists where you live, I think it’s also perfectly fine to just say “it’s been a busy week, I hope you don’t mind if I zone out while you work.” You’re not being rude by saying this and your hairstylist will totally get the message!"

Yes, exercise absolutely can help. But sometimes you need a bottle of something that rattles and a good therapist to talk to."
Needafriend,f9eo2ec,t3_e4nj5v,1575247319.0,You shouldn’t ever feel like you’re being annoying for wanting to reach out for help from others. Fee free to message me if you need someone to talk to.

lonely,f8ud075,t3_e22s5e,1574825728.0,You’re really handsome! Your eyes and smile are very sweet! Don’t tether yourself to a number.... it’s not like it’s a scale rooted in science or anything.
LushCosmetics,f885a8b,t3_dzjtnx,1574348813.0,Thanks for this! I’ve been thinking about trying it. Do you find that the color ever bleeds from your hair? I work out religiously and sweat a lot. The idea of the color running and staining clothes when I’m working out (or even staining pillow cases when I sleep) is one of the reasons I haven’t tried it yet.

lonely,f4cvnbf,t3_dkccnv,1571534490.0,"I’m sorry your parents are dismissing your problems. That’s not right. I don’t think it’s unusual for people to drift apart at the end of hs. I felt that way before I graduated. The good news is when you graduate, you’ll either go to college or start a job and you’ll be exposed to tons of other people to start friendships with. Until then, are there groups you can get involved with outside of school where you can meet people? Like volunteering, clubs or a part time job?"
KindVoice,f4ck6l8,t3_dkaedk,1571530220.0,"I remember being in the same boat as you after college, and how overwhelmed I felt. Take it one day at a time.... the first day of your new job may seem stressful or scary. But each day gets a little easier. You’ve got this!"
