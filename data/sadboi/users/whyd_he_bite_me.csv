residentevil,fp4sqej,t1_fp4r84l,1588306426.0,"First of all I never said anything to even suggest I don't care about what you've said in this thread, so I don't know why you're generalizing at all. I don't pay attention to social media or what other fans say most of the time. It was a fluke that I even commented on this thread. Mastermind, for a fact, is absolutely under-powered coming from playing over 100 hours of mastermind. It's objectively true that playing survivors is hard, but only when the team is bad, and only when the team is bad. It's night and day when you run into a good team versus a bad team. Now I don't personally give a shit about what people say and think about this game in terms of what's it doing for the fan base and all that other stuff you've said because again, I don't pay attention to what goes on on the internet most of the time, so this is completely based off my experience of playing Resistance for so long. I have a group of friends who I play survivors with and we win way over have our games because we all know what to do and how to use our abilities as efficiently as possible minus one guy in the group which causes us to lose most of our games because he loves using niche abilities and doesn't like to listen half the time. If you're playing with random survivors then you'll be losing most of your games. I've noticed that people who aren't premade do some of the dumbest things and one bad player can really screw up the entire experience for everyone. 

The game is without a doubt more in the favor of the survivors. Downing every survivor during the final sequence is pointless since as long as one person is standing on the other side of the doorway, they can revive people while gaining immunity from attacks. Most maps you can stand behind objects and the bio weapons cannot touch you. You can speedrun the game which gives the mastermind little to no chance to setup anything. Valarie at a high level counters cluster zombie builds and Daniel with her ability to constantly buy molotovs . Jill can also clear clusters and deal with tough zombies with her skills. Becca, if you have good RNG, can gain the ability to use infinite rockets which becomes more of a possibility of happening if she's paired with a January who has hidden armory. I hear where you're coming from and trust me, you'd have a better experience if you partnered with people who know how to play instead of playing with random people who don't, or even playing with friends who don't."

I've always enjoyed playing tanks if I wasn't playing Akali, while also being able to kill people without assistance most of the time. Tahm kench filled what I wanted in a tank.

AkameGaKILL,fctqva2,t3_e83hr3,1577954814.0,"I have to disagree with your thoughts on Esdeath's battle with Akame in the anime. Too much plot armor in that fight, so much so that it made me wince. I knew Esdeath was going to die because we always have to have happy endings in most anime which actually sucks. I expected Tatusmi to actually take advantage of Esdeath's emotions towards him and use it as a way to defeat her. Instead, she's defeated by plot armor.

Esdeath never went for any killing blows whenever Akame was left open, and instead opted for kicking.

Esdeath throws her sword away once Akame goes into her demon mode.

Afterimage during the time stop doesn't happen because that's now how after images work. Esdeath was no looking at Akame the moment she dashed up into the air, so there wouldn't be one there. And if there were to be an after image there it would only be there for a few seconds which did happen. Esdeath opted to look left and right four times before finally looking up at the most convenient time for Akame.

It really sucks that such a powerful character went out in such a poor way, at least in the anime version. The manga version is a lot better and well thought out but still a bit stupid. Every time I think about this Anime I just think about how stupid Tatsumi's character is and how he should've been the one to take down Esdeath through manipulating her or possibly redeeming her. 

The writers choices with Tatsumi really spoiled the anime and manga for me. Humanizing Esdeath at the end of the day seemed pointless."
