Talk about it the way you'd talk to someone about a long, strange dream they had. If she pries into getting an opinion on an aspect of the subject matter of her delusions, maybe respond with a similar subject matter in a dream you had or a book you read. You don't have to agree with her to listen to her, and you should make that exact notion clear to her from the get-go of hearing out her emotions. I have episodes of psychosis and this approach works really really well for me. It's worked well for me helping people in my life who were going throuh psychosis as well.

You do not need to believe her, you DO need to validate her.

You don't need to indulge/feed, or even really respond to the delusions, just sit there and listen to her and not be dimissive or panic yourself. Literally, you can just respond with ""That sounds challenging"", ""I am not sure"", ""I don't know"", ""That sounds scary"", etc. You do not need to believe her or to indulge the delusions(if they are even indeed delusions), you can offer sympathy and support without throwing her or the both of you further down this rabbit hole.

Also the most counterfeited product in the world, so what gets sold as ""olive oil"" in grocery stores in North America will not have these medicinal benefits, and could possibly be unsafe for your cat.

I'm sorry if these questions are distressing or strange; I would like to help but only understand distict, specific circumstances. God bless you, I wish nothing but the best for you. May peace find you, my friend <3"
conspiracy,ff2hz4j,t1_fc1yecf,1579506950.0,"I wouldn't be surprised if he's heavily programmed by an MK program and has little to no free will or personality himself. Maybe the show ""House Of Cards"" went too far or he personally started remembering/enacting/exposing hidden/forbidden things, resulting in  the horrible relevations about him on media and his abrupt, vicious downhill spiral."
DMT,fddk12h,t3_ekqzp5,1578315308.0,I encounter a being that looked like this but was vividly colourful on mushrooms once. These beings are the machine elves? I'd been searching for what to call what I encountered for ages. This is beautiful btw
cults,fdd8ott,t3_ekpvrm,1578299923.0,"People are disconnected; they feel alone, purposeless, and that their lives lack meaning. Religions offer an opportunity for connection, meaning, and community. Cults offer a much more involved and complete immersion into connection, meaning, and community than (at least most, from my limited understanding) mainstream religions tend to. Loneliness is massively widespread in the western culture I live in. Individualism is held on high like a virtue, it leaves a lot of social disconnection and dysphoria around self-identity and self-sufficeincy in its wake. A lot of lost people."
mentalillness,fcxegzs,t3_ejed78,1578060782.0,"I had the same issue manifest itself over the course of my grade school years. Could be inattentive type attention deficit disorder, or another dissociative manifestation in and of itself or a byproduct of prolonged major depression"

mdmatherapy,f8dors8,t3_e03vy0,1574502223.0,"I think there's a lot to this. I have horrible abandonment issues that present as horrific overwhelming, all-consuming emotional flashbacks, I attribute these to my traumatic c-section birth. Birth trauma is fascinating, I am very interested in what this topic can help explain about behaviours, emotions, and interactions in adults. Thank you for sharing."
abusiveparents,f8diiaz,t3_e04jsr,1574492379.0,"They sound like terrible human beings, no one with a soul or half a mind would treat their child in such a vile way. Cut off all contact with them as soon as you can get away. Are they as horrible and abusive to your younger siblings as they are to you? If there's a way to cut all contact with them, but be reachable to your younger siblings if they ever need you, that would seem ideal. I'm sorry you have to go through this. No one deserves this horrible treatment, no one deserves to not feel safe in their home & not have a healthy start to life. I hope the world is kind to you away from them, God knows you derserve kindness."
narcissisticparents,f85bpnz,t3_dz0pxz,1574271857.0,"One of my favourite musicians, Sinead O'Connor, went through the same situation of suddenly losing her abusive mother to a car accident.  She wrote a number of songs about her complicated relationship with her mother, and her father, and her mothers' death. Her work might strike a chord with you."
OffMyChestUncut,f7nktf6,t3_dunzv5,1573908627.0,"The day his speech was all choppy and disjointed - from your account that sounds like early signs of psychosis. I know drugs, I have been around many people on many different substances, and I know psychosis and have been around people to see them slip into it. It doesn't sound like drug effects to me.  Understand that it could very well be psychosis, he must be under tremendous distress. Encourage therapy over rehab. Addicts are self-medicating to survive, it's nothing to do with morality or intellect. Therapy can help him process the root of this pain that he is using drugs to try and cope with. Addiction is a symptom of a deep-rooted pain, it's that pain that must be fixed or else he will go from problematic behaviour to problematic behaviour, drugs will be replaced by another compulsive self-soothing mechanism even if he does choose not to use drugs anymore."

Psychic,f6o4pg9,t1_f60z9l6,1573007652.0,"Are you, by any chance, stuck in a loop somewhere in your life? She could be making herself present and disappearing/relocating objects to bring the cycle you have been stuck repeating to your attention. Happened to a friend of mine. Also explains the expression of worry/concern on her face. Hold onto something iron (or hemotite, or jasper, but iron is best) if you are frightened to speak with her, iron will assure your well-being in such ventures if well-being is a potential concern. Ask her aloud, ""Am I stuck in a loop, Jane?"" She may not respond; if she does not try holding onto fresh rosemary instead of iron and asking her again. When objects disappear/reappear, calmly acknowledge it as her doing. She might be trying to communicate something important to you and you may be responding in a way that worries her. She seems sensitive."
