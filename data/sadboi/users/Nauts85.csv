Generally it was a pleasant experience, apart from my own personal anxieties about it.
Had 2 interviews and a practical assessment to see how my brain works things out. Everybody was very friendly none judgmental and understanding so I really wouldnâ€™t worry about been laughed at.
Apparently the adhd assessment is very similar just with one interview instead of two.  
Iâ€™d recommend telling your family they may be more understanding than you expect.  Iâ€™m a 34 year old dad of one and my mum was the first person I told."

Iâ€™m currently waiting for the report to be finished and then I think I go back to discuss it with them.
