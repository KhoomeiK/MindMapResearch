ptsd,ev9xymk,t3_cixy4l,1564334026.0,"It's not clear, she might be telling you that her PTSD has been retriggered (that usually reintroduces a whole variety of symptoms) or maybe she just had one severe panic attack or flashback. But what was the purpose of her phone call? To explain why she hasn't been around, or why she may not be around for a while? You kind of need to follow her lead here. She may not want to be around anybody right now, or maybe she doesn't want to be alone. It could go either way.

I'd just try asking her if there is anything you can do. Or, just send her a message telling her that you are thinking about her and you hope she is doing OK. If she allows you to be around her, maybe try doing little things like providing her a meal, or something to drink. Wash some dishes or clothes, or help pick up around her room or house. Those things tend to be the first get neglected."

My sister on the other hand, announces to everyone ""This is the place, this is the time, this is the date"" and it's not open to discussion, ever. She never, ever asks what anyone's schedule is like, would this day be better over that day, would lunch be better than dinner?

He even went so far as to get his hand in my bathing suit while I was under the water in the pool, with family hanging out in and all around it. And not just me, he hit my mom's generation before mine came along. Nobody would say anything or put a stop to it before I made them all take their heads out of the sand.

Yes it sucks she's kind of announcing she's taking a trip and making you and SO deal with it, but if you decide not to help and one or more pets end up dead, that is going to cause a much, much bigger rift that will be very hard to repair.
