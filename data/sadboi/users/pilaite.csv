ThuleanPerspective,fkq4uvr,t1_fkpvx2g,1584430604.0,"True, he likes to exaggerate a little. Latest example - a post on Twitter 9 hours ago pointing fingers to the COVID19 refugees *fleeing the city*, the trains are all booked, etc. Well, at least in my country, the number of passengers is now very limited in trans-country transport, so of course trains are full faster. Those who rent property in city centers are fleeing to their parents in the country side/smaller cities, everyone who is not in retail does that. What is there to do in the city during the quarantine/lockdown? People take it as a holiday. There are many cars with packed camping gear driving around. 

However, the funniest exaggeration is that he bashes Norwegian schooling system, saying that even the dumbest ones are made to feel talented, worth, etc. AND THEN takes pride in a sentence his Norwegian school psychologist told his mother once: ""He can be anything he wants"" xD this will look amazing slapped on paper in a biography, but for now it's just funny."
ThuleanPerspective,fkq3l0o,t3_fjwrnv,1584429090.0,"For this particular case, officials say virtually everyone will have to contract the virus sooner or later to be immune later on. So I'm not sure what is Varg's long-term plan. Is he staying under the radar forever now?

As a big picture, of course he's right, everyone has become insane, killing themselves at work to be successful knobs in the system. Now we see (not for the first time) how weak the system is. I used to take his preppy talk with a grain of salt, but not so much now. I think he's hinting (on Twitter) that the real problem will be French people revolting against the government, there will be a growing intolerance to giving away the money to the refugees, possible thefts and unruly behavior in the streets in case of food shortage, etc. What would then be really important: self-defense skills, knives, tools, guns, ability to walk/cycle long distances. We have it easy with this COVID business now. The worst case scenario for city dwellers is polluted water.

Edit: Also, as a long time observer I can see Varg is learning at least another two languages - German and Russian. Possibly to be able to read foreign newspapers, or even for the purpose of communicating with the locals in case he has to flee to Eastern Europe. I used to think his plan is perhaps raising his boys and sending them to different directions in Europe to form separate Thulean communities there and securing a broader tribe, but who knows."

There  I was questioned re illnesses and whatnot (I have none). I think they gave me a chocolate bar or a big candy (I was 17 then) and let me go. I chose not to leave the venue and stayed. Later I fainted again waiting in line by the bar (to buy myself some water/juice), I hit the floor and split a wound on my hand, there was some blood. I was quite in shock and didn't know what's happening. A couple approached me and asked whether I had drunk something I shouldn't have. I said no and they found me a security guy, who again let me to the ambulance car where I got my hand bandaged and I didn't return to the venue. Afterwards, I ran some blood tests but they showed nothing. I have felt that sensation of head-spin and shortness of breath a couple of times in big supermarkets I haven't fainted since.

I am really amazed they found each other, Varg should consider himself to be very lucky (as we know he does). I do believe though that he wanted to stay in Norway indefinitely and moving to France is solely Marie's decision, since it's probably easier for her to be near home and deal with the bureaucracy of homeschooling in her native language. Plus, from the little snippets Varg allows us to see, it seems that all official accounts and records (think gun registration) are made in Marie's name so Varg can stay 'anonymous'. French countryside is very bland too, compared to Norway. Financially they would profit from living in Norway considerably more due to sky high benefits, but as we know they are not getting any in France either. I just don't believe Varg can be contained with the fact that his children can't enjoy Norwegian nature as he did, and instead have to rely on pictures and his stories."
