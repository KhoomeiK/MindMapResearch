raisedbynarcissists,fqipd83,t1_fqh1gcw,1589399077.0,"I mean it also depends on the state, but here in CA that's what I've experienced and seen. It's tragic either way - a lot of foster homes are total shit and tons of kids get abused there as well.
Edit: it also depends on counties within the state...so start there if you want to do something about it. 

Again the system as a whole isn't good- and yeah keeping families together is the most important thing unless it's impossible. But for some kids it seems insane to stay with their mom or dad or guardian. 
If other family can get involved that's ideal, most foster homes are temporary and kids get pushed around from house to house then programs, maybe juvi, then they're emancipated from the system or kept on till age 21 mainly just having money thrown at them. It's infuriating and even I've tried changing the status quo but they use us as poster children half the time. The couple success stories are hot news and usually involve a kid graduating college. Trauma is hardly addressed, the most fucked up ones get swept under the rug until they're homeless or incarcerated. It's fucked. I could go on but it's too much guys - but I bet you know a former foster youth you could talk to personally.

As for OP: good luck friend. Please take care of yourself and your brother. I really hope you don't have to ever deal with your mom again unless it's under your own terms. You can try and request a new social worker- BE ANNOYING! The squeaky wheel really does get the oil, man. 

Reach out to adults you trust, I know we're hidden away at home and a part of that will dictate how they deal with your mom. Don't be afraid to email or call people in your life you can count on. I hope those people exsist.

You also have a public defender floating around MAYBE"

Wether it be a program or rehab the alcoholic needs to know when they need to stop and work out how to do that and do it. You either stop drinking or you continue drinking. She's obviously still continuing to drink therefore nothing has changed. You're stuck in the cycle with her. That's all that is bud. You are not helping anyone but yourself thinking you're going to get her sober.
