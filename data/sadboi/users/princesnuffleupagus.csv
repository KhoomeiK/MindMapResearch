Anxiety,foforgq,t3_g6u4dj,1587740118.0,"Thanks for posting this - it definitely resonates with me. A lot of my anxiety comes from hypochondria (I come from a family of medical professionals and have heard a lot of horror stories). With so much time just sitting around without distractions, I've started hyper-focusing on every ache and pain - that pain in my arm is a heart attack. Where'd that dark spot come from on my back? Is this an allergy cough or is this the end?

But realistically, you're right. I'm an otherwise healthy young person with no reason to fear having anything that can actually do damage and it's good to be reminded of that sometimes. I know I'm probably shouting into the void with this, but it feels good to know other people are experiencing a similar feeling and just share what I'm going through."

I actually think he'd be a pretty decent OC in terms of developing Jones, judging by what he did for Dak (average QB talent coming into the NFL turned into a mid-to-high level starter). Not sold on his play calling, but wouldn't be the worst."
NYGiants,fdh4veb,t1_fdh2613,1578415428.0,"Apparently he's the frontrunner to be OC, if he wants the job. Please hold your applause."

But also, what even is Aaron Jones?"
