benzodiazepines,fjyke64,t3_ffi7nj,1583698642.0,The Valium will last a lot longer as far as half life and leaving the body. This is a fairly weak but strong due to its long onset bio availability. It really all depends on the individual and tolerance to the benzodiazepines. Everyone has different reactions chemically and chemistry wise.
benzodiazepines,fjitqiq,t3_fdmlzy,1583375532.0,I would try the smaller independent pharmacies or see if u can have a delivery service like express scripts if that‚Äôs a option or call around usually they are required to have a back up brand. Due to allergy they should. Best of luck!
benzodiazepines,fjilxqo,t3_fdmlzy,1583370539.0,"Yes, they do still make in 2, 5, 10 mg tabs according to Mylans website.
P.S. CVS changes its generics frequently lately or maybe ran out?  Btw how are the Mylan Diazepam compared to Teva ? I am prescribed the 10‚Äôs and 2s of diazepam and have Teva."

benzodiazepines,fijyldu,t3_f889p5,1582468115.0,I saw one In r/benzorecovery awhile back. I could locate it for you. I know it was a USA version of the Ashton manual but also included like ETIz and FluAlp ect.. It was a project that had the proper equivalents per USA for Example 10 mg diazepam really equals 1 mg Of Alprazolam or 1 mg Clonazepam. I am not sure if this is accurate because I know 10 mg diazepam sure does not feel like 1 mg Clonazepam or alprazolam to me. Back soon if I locate this.
benzodiazepines,fia8hc9,t1_fia8543,1582295591.0,I would totally be upset myself! I am glad you found the real ones! Enjoy the warm fuzzies!

benzodiazepines,fi53su7,t3_f6hl30,1582154303.0,It varies one batch they great then it seems less but in reality tolerance is the key factors. Yes some that are made are  more or less.. Just please take it easy on them. They pop easily cause they are usually sweet as candy but run out after the candy runs out. It‚Äôs like a whole other world of hell! Just some friendly advice.
benzodiazepines,fi0gpg3,t1_fi015xf,1582036567.0,Ahh yeah I have had the Galenika Bensiden. Mine put me to sleep also they usually a high grade Serbian product so maybe just how your body chemistry reacts. Some people have good and bad reactions to certain generic also Brand name drugs...
benzodiazepines,fhycvdv,t1_fhxuldv,1581973344.0,That is the only questionable part so far. Check out the pill does it look smooth and have a rim like a disk? I never seen a fake galenika pack of 15 but is possible! They are the legit labels and everything but the batch number with the wonky positioning is questionable... Guess just try it out and you will know.

benzodiazepines,fh7m60c,t3_f1nr59,1581337810.0,No those are the legit Galenikas! Always have batch and expiration on side and the labeling looks correct.

benzodiazepines,fh0373k,t3_esxp0f,1581200073.0,Thanks for the advice I will do that! It‚Äôs so strange How one generic brand can turn people‚Äôs worlds upside down. I see him on the 15th and I will take your word on the XR‚Äôs thanks much!
benzodiazepines,fgwkzq3,t3_esxp0f,1581162465.0,"Yes same! I feel like SANDOZ deserves a big thank you for providing us with genuine consistency! I really now that I think of it and you told me about the Teva inconsistencies, I regret switching this last month. I have been way off and definitely have more melt downs and frustration!Especially if I do something incorrect, it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt retain things and my mood I‚Äôm such an emotional wreck. I work a job where I need to know and ask certain questions all day and the procedures and if I make a mistake, I get hell for it and then I beat myself up for making these mistakes. I do not advertise that I have to take a medication to even function at a job. I almost walked out again for something I was mad about that happened. Anyways lol I will make it! Thanks for the info about this I am gunna stick to them or see if I can get the XR. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è"

DealersBeingBros,fgk7dtl,t3_douzd3,1580859076.0,Scammer he was banned as he was trying to sell zan. Funny thing was prior he is posting stuff in r/benzorecovery but in my opinion when ur in‚Äùrecovery‚Äù and trying to offload benzodiazepines to people who are in recovery for benzodiazepines this m is a big wtf and red flag! Always do your homework and ask other people who are def there to help other Redditors avoid this. Sorry to hear that happened. Karma will come back to get them! They prey on people who are in recovery or in wd because they may think they are more vulnerable or not thinking correct due to this.

benzodiazepines,fgee17n,t3_exy83u,1580697400.0,"Its usually a WD symptom. It normally happens if you cold turkey quit them. And no need to apologize this is for anything benzodiazepine related if you were tapering,  I would recommend r/benzorecovery I have def has this symptom when I would be out of medication. Not sure as to why it is happening to you? Could be the alcohol and weed play a factor? Maybe a tolerance issue and your body is craving more Xanax? You will be alright emotions can happen to. I would contact your doctor or stop the alcohol and weed intake. Best wishes!"
benzodiazepines,fg2cv9g,t1_fg2ac44,1580442615.0,You know that is true and I would not wish dependance or addiction on anybody. I‚Äôm sorry if I did not look at it from that side of the spectrum. I do apologize for that comment.

benzodiazepines,fg0e5fr,t3_ew8w3h,1580405903.0,Yes rebound is def a side effect if not tapered off correctly of any benzodiazepines. ESP long term ones like Diazepam.

benzodiazepines,fg06d61,t3_ew64iu,1580401196.0,"Yes, for sure! I agree that different generic brands affect everyone differenty due to the chemistry and different fillers depending on the brand chosen. I find TEVA for Clonazepam to be pretty great and Teva or Sandoz for my Adderall is wonderful! Of course tolerance does not help unfortunately. Maybe see if your insurance will cover or part cover some of the name brand kinds..Otherwise GoodRx.com if you don‚Äôt has decent price except name brand is still like a down payment for a apartment or something!"
benzodiazepines,fg05e71,t3_ew672m,1580400589.0,Yes very! :) looks good to me!
instacart,fg058ce,t3_evb3up,1580400487.0,"Yes agreed! A couple months back, I had a order for distilled water and they did not specify that it HAD to be distilled due to it being for a fountain.. I got a IC recommended replacement and since Kroger is notorious for not having ordered items in stock. I got spring water as a replacement and they ordered 12 gallons of it! I got a 2 star rating and poor replacement score that totally FU****  up my üíØ% rating. I would have gladly refunded or went to a different store had I known the details of what the water was intended for or if they would have answered my texts and calling! I am Still trying to get my rating back up from this because of some rich ass holes and their non tipping asses. 

They acted like it was ‚Äúall good‚Äùthen went and did this to me like it was my fault.. Lazy LAZY and THEY could have gotten their own water! Sorry, I‚Äôm still pissed off about it. Just had to vent.. lol!"

I went for a fill a few months later and got Sandoz I read up on here and was stoked because I heard they were the gold standard of Adderall. They honestly seem smoother, but this month I got Teva again because after awhile, I get used to it and switch. So it‚Äôs a tie for me, I will take either with no complaint. Everybody‚Äôs chemistry is different of course, so it varies by person. Also, Teva/Barr is the maker of Name brand Adderall I think? I haven‚Äôt had a brand name Ad in forever so may try to get an auth for a brand name next month. Hope your not disappointed and like the sandoz give them a try."

I was dealing with a best friend who overdosed and died all last year. It is so ridiculous that doctors can be so naive to benzodiazepines and abandoning their patients which none of mine warned me when prescribed them all those years.

I call BS on this psychiatrist and because it supposedly work for him does not mean it will work for all!

It really irks me when I hear people on here who have all these anxiety or social agoraphobia issues and nothing but the same shit from the doctors!

Also the adderall is not to be taken as a sell. This is a tool, I am ADHD and cant imagine trying to manage life without it ever! 

I understand the anxiety and stuff it causes, that is just the first couple months until you get used to the medication and you should if your true ADHD it will calm u down. I don‚Äôt get that speedy feeling..
