I am your fan since my teenage years(I'm 28 now) and I couldn't be happier to grow up with your songs, you always lifted my spirits, brought me to a great mood, made me closer to some really deary friends! I love you and always will!
And for my question, I want to know if you have plans for coming to Brazil 🙈 I swear I didn't want to ask that, but I love you so much for so many years and nothing would make my happier than seeing you in person 😍 It hurts me a lot that you could not make to your show in São Paulo, but let's not talk about that or I will cry 😂 Anyways, that was my question and once again, thank you for everything! You take a huge part of my life, everyone that I find from my teenagers years asks if you still loves you and the answer is a resounding yes 😄
Love you, Kelly!!"
