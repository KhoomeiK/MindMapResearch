DWPhelp,fr5sjve,t3_gmolsk,1589913943.0,"I claim Universal Credit as I currently can’t work due to severe depression and anxiety. I kept providing Med3 Fit Notes from my GP, and after a few months claiming I got sent a Work Capability Assessment form in the post where you describe how your illness affects your day to day life, what treatments you had/are currently having, how long it’s been happening etc. Once sending this back all filled in (this was during lockdown) a few weeks later I get a note in my journal that I’m deemed unfit for work and work related activity, which means I no longer have to keep providing fit notes and will not be asked to look for work.

This was all done during lockdown and I wasn’t asked to attend a face to face assessment, but I provided a lot of evidence in my form and it was quite detailed so that’s probably why.

I’m unsure if it’ll be any different for you as I am diagnosed by a psychiatrist and under adult mental health services, so maybe you could get a referral from your GP for some support as well."

TooAfraidToAsk,fpdcoys,t3_gcm3nd,1588524392.0,"When I was 12, 6 years ago, I was messaging a friend and told her to kill herself. 

Honestly I don't know why I even said it, we weren't arguing or anything, and I think I just said it in a way of fucked up humour. My brother made a joke to me previously about getting a one-way train ticket to jump of this bridge nearby which has had a few suicides, so I repeated it to my friend via message and told her to buy a one-way ticket to that bridge and jump off. 

I feel sick even typing that.

She obviously stopped talking to me and I got a lot of abuse down the phone off her dad, and rightfully so. I felt fucking awful and disgusting and criedfor days. We were off school for two weeks at that point so I didn't have to see her yet, but when we went back I apologised in person, which she didn't accept understandbly as I'd said such a horrible thing to her. 

A few weeks passed and our friend group all went to the park, and I was already on the train there by the time I found out she'd be there too. I offered to go back home so she could stay out but my other friend told me she wanted to talk to me.

We separated from the rest of the group and sat talking for about 5 hours. I apologised as much as I could and we talked it out. She forgave me and gave me a hug, but I've never forgiven myself. 

She's still my best friend to this day and I love her so much. Couldn't ask for a better pal, but I still think of how horrible I was that day. I know I was just being a stupid kid and didn't mean it, but I just can't forgive myself. I was bullied severely in primary school beforehand, so i knew firsthand how awful it could make someone feel. Yet I went and told her to kill herself? 

I don't think I'll ever forgive myself and I'll always carry that guilt of bullying someone."

depression_help,fdizv4k,t3_elisfi,1578454894.0,"Hey, I did my GCSEs nearly two years ago and was in such a similar situation to you. I know they feel like the most important thing in the world right now (that's exactly how they felt to me and the pressure I was putting on myself was unbearable). I was also self-harming at this time and it's such an awful thing to do. I'd stay late, around 6/7pm/ at school just to avoid feeling so lonely at home. I completely understand the pressure you must feel about your exams, especially since the new 9-1 grading system is quite difficult (I did the very first year of them).

Believe me when I say this - GCSEs aren't the be all and end all. Yes, they are important and matter, but your wellbeing is much more important than exams you could resit in the future anyway. Definitely try your best, but give yourself time to think about yourself and what you want from life. If there's a teacher you can trust, maybe try telling them you're struggling to keep up a bit and are worried about the exams because they are literally there to help you and want you to do your best. 

Running away isn't going to help you. Sure, in the short-term you might feel a bit better, much like cutting your foot, but overall it could really damage you. 

You're doing your GCSEs now, so you'll be turning 16 soon? Your GP can't legally tell your parents what's going on unless they become really concerned, so it might be useful speaking to the doctor to see what support they can offer - you'll probably get referred to CAMHS or put on a lose dose of medication.

You CAN get through this, even though right now that seems like that most annoying thing you can hear, but it's true. You are stronger than you think. And it's okay to feel like this.

Something simple that helps me is to make your room into a comfy and relaxing place. Like build into your routine, amybe at like 9pm every night, to do some form of self care like a face mask, hot bath, moisturising your body, reading a book, lighting a candle, sitting with a pet if you have one, even just getting a big notebook just to scribble down all your thoughts and feelings every night could be really benefical. I like to listen to music in the bath with candles lit all around it; it's calming just lying there, warm and clean, in a lovely smelling room with no one to speak to. Learn to enjoy your own company. A lot of people don't read much nowadays because they're too precoccupied with social media, films etc. I stopped reading when I became depressed and still struggle a lot to concentrate on a book, but I try my best to read at least a few a year just to escape into another world for a while. 

Kooth is an online therapy chat which you can use for one hour per week, I don't know if it's available in your area but worth a look. You can also ring Childline literally whenever you need support, or you can message them 1-2-1 chat at any time. They are both completely confidential and will only tell someone if they are really worried about your safety. Don't feel bad if you need to take a sick day off school every now and then, but don't make it a habit either. Put yourself first because you are the most important thing.

Feel free to message me as well if you want someone to talk to. :)"

Some of them even told me they liked it there and didn't want to leave, which completely baffled me cos I hated every second in that shithole. A lad had been there 10 months and is still there now, it is literally crazy.  He'd tell me the nurses' social media names and their family's socials because he was obsessed with them and sometimes cry if his favourite nurse wasn't working. 

I made the mistake of lending a smuggled phone charger to this girl and when she gave it me back, she did it in the most obvious way ever and literally told me she wanted them to see it. She was always getting restrained and ""kicking off"" and would ask other patients to ""kick off"" with her.
