Income Share Agreement (‚ÄúISA‚Äù)
A Tuition (‚ÄúTuition‚Äù) of ten percent (10%) of Participant‚Äôs post-program gross income paid on a monthly basis.
Tuition commences when Participant has monthly income that is annualized at $45,000 or more (‚ÄúMinimum Income Threshold‚Äù). Once the Minimum Income Threshold occurs, the aggregate of all monthly income is used for purposes of the calculation and not the excess above the Minimum Income Threshold.  By way of example, if the Minimum Income Threshold is $3,750 for a month and Participant earns $4,750 in that month, the Tuition is $475 ($4,750 x .10), and not $100 ($1,000 [$4,750 - $3,750] x .10).

I‚Äôm still finishing out my last month after a bit of time off due to an I jury, but I‚Äôm not at all regretting my decision, as I have been more and more annoyed by the workouts and I don‚Äôt really look forward to going anymore.  Time to do something new."

orangetheory,fb40zdf,t1_fb3c6kh,1576498793.0,"Depends on the type of class.  

For power day, base 5-5.2, push 6.0-6.6, all out 6.6-7.0 (speed depends on time of the segment... 30 all out faster than one minute all out. 

For endurance or strength, I attempt a 5.0 base and even decrease it sometimes and still struggle to hang onto it.  

Been the same for 2 years, not seeming to be able to improve at all.  (I am a 8x a month member if that has anything to do with it, but I do do other types of exercise most days of the week)."

????"
orangetheory,fb2vjxw,t1_fb2tips,1576458523.0,"Yes I do want to improve running endurance.  Power walking isn‚Äôt a a challenge for me, so I attempt to jog/run.  I do tend to want to try to do difficult things.  I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm training at a level where I can improve or am I attempting to train at a level that I can‚Äôt improve because it‚Äôs above my ability?  I honestly don‚Äôt know how to tell the difference..."
