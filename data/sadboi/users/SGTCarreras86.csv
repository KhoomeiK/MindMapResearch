We've both been through tough lives, depressed and suicidal for years. She was the only person I felt comfortable talking about it with, we understood each other. As to be expected, human nature, I developed feelings for her. First time I could actually see myself with someone for the rest of my life, we had got on well together shortly after meeting last year.

Then came the final day before government lockdown, I was thinking now or never.
As it turns out she has no interest in me in that respect whatsoever.

I went from actually feeling properly happy for the first time in years, to wrecked once again. From spending time each day with the one person I could be myself with to having no human contact for the foreseeable future. 

I've gone back into my proverbial shell, and wish I hadn't lived the past year, I was only putting further stress on her that she really could've done without. I suppose it was nice to feel happy again, but it just makes me more hollow now."
