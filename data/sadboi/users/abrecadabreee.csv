And of course I‚Äôm not gonna list details of the good things about him because that‚Äôs not why I posted on this sub. I wanted to talk about a specific issue, not a list of pros and cons of our relationship? 

But thanks for the response."

relationships,fo60u69,t1_fo60hx9,1587542302.0,"I just try not to let his lack of ‚Äúprimary education‚Äù lead me to believe he is full of nonsense. He‚Äôs been 7 years in this game. There‚Äôs a lot of geniuses out there who we don‚Äôt even know, who live in the slumps of India, and we‚Äôll probably never know just because they don‚Äôt have the resources. 

I get what you‚Äôre saying though. Gambling the tight money we have is not a good idea right now. Focusing on a career to pay the bills is."
relationships,fo60gvt,t1_fo5s5un,1587541920.0,"It‚Äôs crazy because I cannot find anywhere, anything related to his specific obsession. 
I‚Äôve found articles on OCD behaviors, but nothing narrowed. 

I really do believe he knows what he is talking about. It may be a disorder in regards to how much he obsesses over it, but the mathematical numbers are very real."
relationships,fo604ly,t1_fo5zuss,1587541576.0,"He is. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôve been surviving lately. We have to pay rent/bills and then whatever is extra usually $30/40, he takes that and turns it into $300, depending on how long he wants to hold it, can be more... his methods work. I have no doubt in my mind that he knows what he is doing and really sees it in a different way. I just don‚Äôt think it is healthy how much time he puts into it.

Edit: He says if he really got to where he explained it to someone already familiar with the market, that it would change the world. He just is so overwhelmed and says he needs to really put it all on paper. Right now it‚Äôs all in his head."
relationships,fo5zw5y,t1_fo5pom6,1587541335.0,"I would say that as well. I‚Äôm not so educated on the types of these delusional disorders, however so I don‚Äôt know when an obsession turns into a disorder."
