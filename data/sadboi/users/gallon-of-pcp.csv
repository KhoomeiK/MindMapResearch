Cast iron cookware works best IMO but isn't necessary


* 3 cups white rice
* 6 cups chicken stock
* 1-2 lbs smoked sausage, sliced (usually andouille is used but kielbasa works well too)
* 2-3 chicken thighs, chopped
* 3-4 onions, diced
* 3-4 bell peppers, diced
* 3-5 celery stalks, chopped
* 1-2 bay leaves
* Minced garlic (to taste but I usually use a lot)
* High smoke point cooking oil (I use avacado)

All seasons to taste:
* Salt
* Pepper
* Smoked paprika
* Red pepper *
* Basil
* Oregano
* Garlic Powder
* Optional: Cayenne *
* *use sparingly if you don't like heat

Caramelize onions in dutch oven

Brown sausage in skillet & set aside

Brown chicken skillet & set aside

By now onions should be nice & brown so add bell peppers & celery to dutch oven 

Let all that saute a bit then add garlic, saute til fragrant, then add chicken and sausage

Add chicken stock and season to taste

Bring to boil, and add rice, stir to mix everything together, and reduce to simmer

Set bay leaves on top, cover & set timer for 15 minutes

After 15 min, should have cooked down quite a bit and only a little liquid by this point. Remove the bay leaves and turn the rice once or twice

Put cover back on and let cook another 15 minutes until liquid fully absorbed

Turn the rice once more, remove from heat, let cool a few, and serve!

For the okra I but browned some onions, added the okra, sprinkled a bit of garlic salt & sauteed"

Treeparents,f0hsrjd,t1_f0hjr63,1568629593.0,"Hey sorry I got snippy. I often see/hear ""ADHD isn't real!!! Stop drugging your kid!"" or some variation thereof. Meanwhile, my kid is a brain tumor survivor who is seen by a whole ass team of specialists and has had hours of neuropsych testing  (repeated every 5 years til he is an adult) and they're ALL like ""yeah this kid has dysgraphia and ADHD with significant executive dysfunction, in excess of what's normally seem in ADHD so that's likely secondary to the tumor."" A chunk of the general public, and some educators, don't believe any of those things are legit and it just gets freaking tiring. But it is well known among those who treat that pediatric brain tumors, that ADHD (or ""ADHD-like symptoms"" if you prefer) is much more common in this population than those who have not had any sort of brain injury and that stimulants help their symptoms. They tell me it doesn't matter if it's acquired or inherited from me, the symptoms and treatment are the same. 

Haven't had a chance to fully read the article but executive dysfunction doesn't even seem to be mentioned? ADHD is not just a disorder of inattention and hyperactivity. Executive function can be, and often is, severely impaired.

Anyway, the crux of my irritation is this: the huge swath of teachers that don't believe ADHD, and in our case also dysgraphia, are real are likely the reason I can't get most of them to follow my child's damn 504 plan! Just one example - they're supposed to provide him skeleton notes and he hasn't gotten any at all yet this year. Not from a single teacher. It's a joke. The accommodations are all reasonable on paper and consistent with the suggestions in his neuropsych report from his team, but the teachers ignore it so it's worthless.

Edit: Ok, here is his solution:

>For my second group of patients with severe attention issues, I require a full evaluation to find the source of the problem. Usually, once the original condition is found and treated, the ADHD symptoms go away.

They do take kids who aren't eligible for a trial through their charity arm but that's on a case by case basis. They also do second opinions free (my son had one with their neuropathologist & brain tumor board, they were great). Anyway, not shitting on St. Jude - they do great things and have helped my family personally - but I think people outside the community tend to think they just like treat any/every kid with cancer. 

Personally I donate primarily to CureSearch.org, which is the fundraising arm of the [Children's Oncology Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Oncology_Group). COG is the world's largest organization for pediatric cancer research. Pretty much anyone in the US who treats childhood cancer is in the COG and they usually have ~100 clinical trials going at a given time. 

Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation and St. Baldricks also do good work and I've donated to both."
pics,f03tvl3,t1_f03qyu3,1568370060.0,"Brain tumors are the most common solid tumor in children so I don't think it's location so much. It's not an absolute either but even with the same diagnosis, the kids tend to have better outcomes (eg with gioblastoma, kids tend to have longer survival than adults). lt's not always that way though. DIPG is a brain tumor that occurs only in children and is always fatal, usually within 6 months. It is the cruelest cancer dx I know of."

askscience,ex9w6lq,t1_ex94w27,1566095274.0,Hyperemesis gravidarum is what it's called when it becomes so bad you need to be hospitalized. I was in and out of the ER constantly my first trimester and lost a significant amount of weight. The vomiting lasted my entire pregnancy but it was much more manageable by the 3rd trimester. It also took me about that long to get over my embarrassment of puking in public.
Genealogy,ex0btbx,t1_ex0bcwt,1565909195.0,"Absolutely. I tend to do my genealogy in spurts though. So I'll get a 6 month Ancestry subscription, Newspapers.com, order vital records, buy relevant history books (I have a huge wishlist of books about Acadians in particular), etc... By the time my Ancestry subscription lapses I'm usually starting to burn out so that's a good point to take a break. 

Edit: I don't know why I was downvoted for this? Fuck me for not having the budget to be able to justify an Ancestry subscription year round I guess"

Genealogy,ex01y0s,t3_cqpvh0,1565903783.0,"Different branches of my family came here at different times. I feel the most connection with my mom's roots, which are Cajun. Despite being the branch that's been here the longest (since mid 1700s), it's the only heritage that was really part of my life growing up. While neither me or my mom speak French, both my grandparents did and most my aunts and uncles do. I was taught phrases in French as a child and some French children's songs (I *loved* to sing Alouette, Gentille Alouette as a child lol). I grew up eating gumbo and jambalaya and being called ""sha"" by my relatives. So despite being born outside Louisiana, I feel a lot of connection to my Cajun roots. 

On my dad's side - his father has Sicilian ancestry. Those ancestors immigrated fairly recently, I think about 3-4 generations ago (sorry don't feel like checking my tree lol). Dad's mom was the most recent immigrant in my tree. She was born in England but 3/4 of her great grandparents were born in Ireland (with the 4th being from Wales). 

I feel a kind of connection to the other places my ancestors were from (aside from Louisiana and England, where I still have family today) in the sense that I'm more interested in the history of those places because I like to imagine how my ancestors lived - what their lives were like and what major events likely impacted them. I'm fascinated by deep genealogy too (which ties into my interests in archaeology and anthropology), like where my pre-history ancestors were from and how they might have lived. There isn't much published about my maternal haplogroup yet so I'm super curious to learn where it likely originated."
Genealogy,ex00iqo,t1_ewyg0sv,1565903228.0,"On my mom's side it has. We are Cajun so our ancestors migrated first from France to Acadia, then were expelled in the mid 1700s and ended up in Louisiana. Unfortunately I do not speak French, but most of my aunts and uncles do (exceptions being my mom and her one sister, who were born after the family left Louisiana). Some of my great-grandparents spoke *only* French. I've been learning, slowly lol, on Duolingo. Having grown up hearing it spoken pretty regularly (and bring taught phrases and songs as a child) I'm finding that I pick up things pretty quickly but I'm inconsistent with my practice so overall progress has been slow. I really need to enlist my aunt more often to practice with me. She lives next door and though her French is rusty, she used to be fluent and is still conversational."
Cooking,ewyreep,t1_ewyqg4b,1565885688.0,"Agree on the dark roux, which is probably why my jambalaya is much tastier than my gumbo since it doesn't need a roux at all. I do it on low and just got an enameled cast iron dutch oven so I will try being a little less overzealous in my stirring next time, my arm will certainly appreciate it lol"
Cooking,ewyptss,t1_ewykl8v,1565884997.0,I'm Cajun but just recently started learning how to cook our traditional dishes. I have yet to get my roux darker than peanut-butter colored because I worry to much about the heat and go too slow and ultimately get tired of stirring.

Documentaries,ewrykce,t1_ewrw6x1,1565716521.0,"When I'd tell them I'm scared to press charges because of what he could do when he gets out, and that he might kill me as he'd threatened to do, and they basically shrugged - it made me think there was nothing that could be done. They didn't tell me I could get a CPO and that could have him immediately evicted so I didn't have to live with someone who might want to kill me. They could have also told me me and my son could go to a DV shelter. I was pretty young and such things weren't really on my radar because I was raised in a healthy, functional home. They didn't bother to tell me about any of the resources that were available for me so I could have some semblance of safety during and after leaving him. 

Anyway, even after I got my CPO and *did* try to pursue charges for violations, they usually stonewalled me. I reported like 5 violations before they finally charged him with a CPO violation; and they finally did it then only because I had a voicemail as proof of the threats he'd made."

Documentaries,ewozv1w,t1_ewozjs2,1565630373.0,I'm sorry you went through that. I've heard this from other survivors several times now and I hate that it is seemingly so widespread.
Documentaries,ewoxz5i,t1_ewowyrz,1565629186.0,"I honestly don't know. At the time when I was going through it, I truly thought these resources weren't available to me because it wasn't ""bad enough"" and the cops just backed up that perception, although I was never told outright I couldn't get a CPO (they just never corrected my misunderstanding that that was the case). In the instance of my friend who is currently going through this - I can't understand why they didn't let her file charges on some of the stuff she reported, let alone told her she wouldn't get the order. The stuff that's been going on is textbook stalking: following her, threats, implying he's monitoring her house and activities, etc."
Documentaries,ewoteup,t1_eworfzl,1565626255.0,"They could have informed me I could get a restraining order, and that with that I could have had him immediately evicted from our apartment. As it was I had no where else to stay and thought he'd be getting of jail and coming back to the apartment we shared, and that I'd have no way to stop that (you have to give someone 30 days notice to vacate before you can even start an eviction). I didn't understand that situations like mine qualified for protection orders because I didn't have broken bones or bad bruises and so it was my word against his. Through multiple contacts with the police in which I expressed I was afraid for my life and felt trapped and the reason I didn't want to pursue charges was fear, no one corrected the misunderstanding. When they would ask if I wanted to press charges they'd say things to the effect of ""I don't know if the prosecutor would pursue this because it's his word against yours but we can take him in and try if you want to press charges"" so I felt like the things he was doing to me weren't that bad (because you tend to minimize when you've been abused long term) and that the odds of the charges actually sticking were slim. Mind you, at least one of those times I was reporting that he had choked me until I passed out, and it sounded like a long shot anything would stick - my neck was red but not bruised, the usual ""it's his word against yours and he's saying you're exaggerating"" - so I let it go.

Edit: Even worse, when I finally got my CPO they often refused to press charges when he violated it. I reported violations like 5 times before they finally agreed to charge him with a CPO violation. They'd call and tell him to stop and refuse to do anything else."
Documentaries,ewon6sw,t1_ewomz52,1565622145.0,"If anyone had explained to me that I could get a protection order (I thought I needed more evidence than I had, since basically all I had was my word against his), I probably would have left years earlier. I think more in the way of educating victims about what legal protections are available could help many. 

IME it is often the opposite though, cops discouraging victims from pursuing protection orders and telling them they won't qualify. Just had to encourage a friend to apply anyways after the cops told her she wouldn't get a CPO. She got her order."
Documentaries,ewokxa8,t1_ewokptr,1565620599.0,"He would have been out in a day or so (according to the cops even) and then I would have had to deal with the consequences of getting him arrested. Early on when I did try to pursue charges a few times, they made it clear it was my word against his since he was smart enough to do things like choke me instead of punch me (so there were usually no significant bruises).

Edit: Also when you tell the cops ""I'm scared to press charges because I'm afraid he'll kill me when he gets out if I do"" and they basically just shrug, it doesn't really give you much confidence that that's the best route to take or that anything will be done to prevent him from following through and actually killing you."

Documentaries,ewogjhi,t1_ewoeiq6,1565617391.0,"Can confirm. When I was living in Stow the police were out to my apartment many times because my son's dad was extremely violent and sometimes I was afraid he'd kill me if someone didn't intervene. However, I always declined to press charges, always explaining that I was afraid of retaliation when he got out of jail (namely, fear he'd kill me for getting him arrested). The last time I called, they told me to stop wasting resources and not to call 911 again unless I planned to press charges. So I stopped calling for help. Eventually I left (when the fear of him killing me if I stayed became greater than the fear of him killing me for leaving) and found out I could get a protection order when he continued to stalk me. Even after I got the order, though, it was usually a struggle to get the cops to do anything about violations."
