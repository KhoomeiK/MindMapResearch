AskReddit,fpl2q7p,t1_fpiryoq,1588705323.0,Stayed with some friends and they were feeding their kids McDonalds every day. They had home cooked meals sometimes but it was mostly McDonalds. It's a weird position to be in because I'm not a parent and didn't really want to act like I knew better... but isn't it obvious that isn't a good idea? The kids also went batshit insane having coke all the time. Weird to compare to my own childhood when something like McDonalds was a special treat you might get on Friday or something.
AskReddit,fpl1lu8,t1_fpig5vu,1588704769.0,"I felt this having two anti-social parents. If I went to a friend's house or had a friend over, that would basically be the accepted 'quota' for the week- asking to do anything else and I would get ""you already did X this week."" (Although I definitely didn't normally do one thing a week, try once every 3 or 4). They used to claim I would get too tired for school the next day if I did something on a week night even though I don't remember that ever being a problem? (I feel like they were projecting there, they've always been very.. low energy themselves). I depended on them for rides since we lived a bit out of town and I was nowhere near any of my friends.

Unrelated to that but I ended up dropping out of high school with depression and anxiety, at which point they would start asking why I never wanted to go anywhere, claiming they would take me to a friend's house whenever I asked. Yes, when I'm overwhelmed by panic and scared of my own shadow, that's the time to start hitting the town. I understand it's important to make sure you leave the house in that state but they seemed genuinely confused why I might not feel up to that, saying it was weird I didn't get bored at home... like they weren't the ones to encourage me to skip out on social events for years. I wonder how so many parents can be blind to this."

AskReddit,fpkyz3z,t1_fpis2a4,1588703472.0,"Mine was complaining about her marriage to me from when I was probably about 8 or 9 into my teens. In some ways I think it really messed me up, for multiple reasons. Aside from it being wrong to emotionally depend on a kid, it made me feel like I was going crazy sometimes. She would rant to me about him while we were alone but then he would come home from work and she would be all smiles asking about his day. It was beneficial for her because she got it out of her system but it left me emotionally exhausted having all of it dumped on me and then watching them play happy families (having said that, they did used to argue a lot too)

I don't think my mum appreciates what a bad idea it was badmouthing not only my dad but men in general (through disapproving of the things he did, she basically just lumped men into the one category). I can remember being 14 and thinking all men were awful because she had drilled it into me. Even though my dad definitely wasn't perfect, I still could have had some sort of relationship with him. It's a strange situation because I feel like she turned me against him but despite her being the one who actually resents him in many ways, their relationship is okay and I'm the one who has an awkward relationship with him. I mean, it goes through periods of being fine but I feel like it's pretty fractured overall (and saying their relationship is okay isn't high praise. I still think they would've been better splitting years ago but I guess they're comfortable now).

Anyway, even as a kid I would say to my mum I don't think she should be telling me that stuff but she would say she had no one else to talk to. That always made me feel bad which isn't fair at all. Get a marriage counsellor, don't dump all this shit on your kid."
Anxiety,fpkwhwu,t3_ge2jol,1588702244.0,"I think pretty much everyone is but obviously people with anxiety are going to have these intrusive thoughts even more. There was this one year I went to a party after not being social for a long time. I mildly embarrassed myself a few times which in hindsight was no big deal but for a long time after that, I would just sit around obsessing about everything I did and what those people must think of me. Even though I knew in reality if they hadn't forgotten yet, they probably would soon enough. Eventually I let it go but stuff like that really makes it hard to be social again in the future. I worry I'll give myself more to obsess about so I play it safe, to the point where I don't really let anyone see the real me.

It helps sometimes for me to think of my embarrassments and whatever else I linger on and ask myself what I would think if I saw someone else do that. It's then I realise I'm way too hard on myself and if somebody else did the same stuff, I wouldn't really think too much about it and/or would quickly forget it after. We're so in our own heads it can be difficult to remember everyone makes mistakes but they do; it's not just us and it's no big deal."

Nothing wrong with that, I've written fics for Korean and Japanese fandoms as well. But this particular story got way so caught up in the details to the point where it was distracting. As in they would use terminology that was correct but since it was the Korean word, I wouldn't know what it was until I reached the end notes where they had translations.

No shade on those authors, everyone has to start somewhere and if they enjoy it then that's fine by me. But these types of stories have become memes. People who don't really know anything about fanfiction might catch a video of someone reading an unintentionally hilarious fic on youtube and come away thinking THAT is fanfic at its core when it isn't. It's (objectively) bad fanfiction but obviously not a reflection on fic as a whole. And when youtubers read fanfiction of themselves, it's almost always bad which is entertaining but does nothing for this poor perception of fic.

Another misunderstanding I've come across that may also stem from looking to young, inexperienced authors as the standard is the belief all fanfiction is inherently sexual. Yes, a lot of it is and I'm more than okay with that, but to dismiss all of fanfiction as porn without a plot or essentially just someone's sexual fantasies really undermines all the hard work and planning people put into their stories (and totally discounts the fact that a lot of people write G rated stories). And honestly, the attitude that a story with sexual elements is 100% bad doesn't make any sense either. People know well written erotica exists, right?

And wow, the idea of a fic being ruined for somebody over an untagged ship being mentioned seems a bit oversensitive! It's interesting we've complained on here about things being overtagged, which I definitely agree with but at the same time, I can see why people might feel the need to essentially have a warning for every little thing that happens in the fic (including even small ship mentions) if people get upset it wasn't in the tags.

I did actually wonder what it might be like for a writer who has Aphantasia, or at least some trouble visualizing things.

People thinking differently in general fascinates me. I've had some interesting discussions with a friend about it. Shes's amazed me when I describe how I think which is pretty much mostly visuals with a few 'sound bytes' mixed in. I was amazed in turn when she described her  thoughts as an ongoing 'inner monologue.' I think in pictures more than words. If I want a glass of water, I 'see' myself going to get it. 

When it comes to writing, I'm basically the exact opposite of you.

Lots of movie trailers nowadays are mini movies and show the whole damn movie, leaving no mystery whatsoever. A good trailer is a bit more vague, not explicitly spelling out what it's about but giving you a feel for it and hopefully intriguing you enough to check out the full length movie. A good example is Midsommar. I don't think any of the trailers give away the plot yet they perfectly convey the atmosphere you can expect for the movie. It also gives you enough that you have *some* idea what it might be about but still can't really say for sure until you watch it. I feel the same way about fic summaries. I don't mind if they go into detail but if they're vague about it in a way that captures my attention, it works. Do people really want to be told everything that happens?

The other thing is, I feel like those in favour of summaries that list every event (eg characters go somewhere and do something specific) aren't taking into account the fact that some fics (especially those on the shorter side) are more introspective and don't really involve any 'action.' What do you suggest those authors put as a summary? 'X thinks about her feelings?' I mean they could but IMO it's less interesting. A line from the fic sets the tone readers can expect."

So with what felt like a fresh perspective, I decided to post it and it was well received. It gave me the confidence to post more. I've edited fics from a few years ago and posted them as well as new stuff.

I'm lucky there are still heaps of readers within the fandom but occasionally I kind of wish I had posted back when I first wrote them.

They can easily seek out these stories online, read a few paragraphs and leave a hateful comment whereas they might need to go out and buy a Stephen King book, which seems like a waste of money for something they know they won't even like. Their 'feedback' would obviously be more difficult to get to him as well but the thing about someone like Stephen King is, he is (obviously) on accomplished writer.

I think it's very telling about the direction we're heading in. I know a lot of these people are probably just too young to realise receiving likes isn't an actual achievement and will outgrow it eventually. But more and more it seems like we're sending the message that getting attention is the most important thing, above all else- including having an actual talent. Just look at all the people who get famous for essentially doing nothing, it's all a glorified popularity contest. I've seen some pretty obvious attempts to get a top comment from stringing together various phrases that already have a highly liked comment on the same video or just outright stealing a comment from somewhere else. Attention is all that matters, even if you're stealing something someone else said for meaningless internet points. I'm not sure how to explain myself properly here but basically I feel like we're heading towards the Black Mirror episode Nosedive pretty fast. In some ways we're kind of already there."

The song was literally written for the show. You might come across it without watching if you're a fan of Zendaya or Labrinth but the overwhelming majority would have discovered the song from watching the series.

There was this pond next to the school, I think technically off school grounds but it was right next to the stadium and not over a fence or anything so it didn't seem like a big deal for me and my friend to go eat lunch there. We were both having a tough time being bullied so it was nice to go and unwind there for a bit. We would watch the ducks everyday and it was peaceful. Occasionally a teacher would come and yell at us to get back on school grounds but it didn't happen often. 

One day, a group of boys came over and started throwing rocks into the water. And these weren't just little ones- at least one heaved a massive rock they needed two hands to even pick up- more like a boulder I guess. I don't remember seeing it happen but inevitably one of the ducks must have been hit because suddenly there was a dead duck floating around in the pond. I'm sure anyone would find that upsetting but my friend and I were both pretty sensitive and already going through a shit time so it was even worse. A teacher came over and told us all to get back on school grounds. We tried telling them the boys had killed a duck but they didn't care. It's been 15 years since I left that school and I can't help but think back on how shitty it was even now."

Meanwhile you have a video like this year's YouTube rewind, that has a couple of Kpop groups mentioned (since they played it safe and focused on statistics this year) and these groups received a lot of views. Someone commented criticizing YouTube for deleting views from a BTS video previously but then celebrating them in this. Regardless of your views on Kpop, that's a fairly hypocritical thing to do. The replies? They deserved to have the views deleted because Kpop sucks, and my favourite, 'Kpop should be deleted' which had a thousand thumbs up. Really great, intelligent responses. Way to attack someone for making a valid statement.

Honestly, my best theory for why so many people hate Kpop is because it's popular with teenage girls. I've seen countless judgmental remarks about girls 'thirsting' over people on Twitter or wherever else. Assuming they stay in their own circle, how does this affect people?

My other guess is overexposure comes into it. People are sick of hearing about Kpop from their friends who are into it, they're tired of seeing it mentioned online, ect. It's the same with Billie Eilish, I never used to hear anything negative about her but now that she's blown up, there are countless videos and remarks about her being overrated.

She was unsure about the cost of travel and hotel, didn't have a babysitter and obviously wasn't eager to make that kind of trip with kids those ages. People in the know commented saying kids aren't even appropriate at such an event but posters who wanted to be angry at the OP ignored that, called her selfish and unsupportive, some even going as far as saying they're glad they don't have a wife like her, which is just such an unnecessary and mean thing to say.

In my opinion the majority of posters (at least on such issues) are teenagers or adults who don't have many responsibilities. It's obvious when they remark that people owe nothing to anyone or that their money is theirs alone (in response to shared finances within relationships). Some say it's a pro-women sub but I disagree, they'll jump on anyone they deem unsupportive, especially within married couples.

Among that food, I got myself some snacks. At one point I wasn't quite hungry enough to finish one of these snacks so I put it in the fridge with plans to eat it later. But when I went to get it I discovered he had eaten it.. It was arguably such a small thing and probably not meant to be disrespectful but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I mean maybe ask first?? I wonder if upbringing comes into it at all because at my house growing up, while we had foods we shared, if we had our own specific snack, no one would just eat it without asking.

But I digress, in your cast OP, this is just blatant disrespect. At first I thought 'okay.. this is annoying but maybe he's just oblivious.' But to specifically ASK if you WANTED the burger then eat it right in FRONT of you.. that's just messed up. Especially considering you've made your feelings known about him eating your food.

They're getting way too caught up in the idea of 'this thing is important therefore OP should go' as if there's nothing more to it and OP is just being difficult for the sake of it when they really aren't. It's not effortless to just 'show up' as some have suggested.

Kids aren't dolls who will keep still and sit in total silence, ESPECIALLY not at that age. 1 and 3?? Those are like prime tantrum ages. It's not a matter of IF one (or both) have a tantrum but WHEN. The idea of looking after kids and having them loudly make a scene in public makes me anxious and it's happened to me before.

Jesus, it's like people who question what youtube comments are talking about when they reference things from the video without just watching the damn thing first to understand it. Some people just write something down the moment a thought hits them instead of bothering to check first. It's like they use their energy for the wrong thing."
FanFiction,f50r3gj,t3_dmfks5,1571931625.0,"*Everything went swimmingly and I was well beyond the limits of pleased. I did not arrive to this story out of boredom, I ascended out of my liberal uncensored ligitamacy for ascertaining and perfect stories such as this, as I say now well done good sir/lady, live well and a thousand good wishes to you.*

I thanked them because it seems to be a positive comment... but my brain hurts when I read this."
AmItheAsshole,f50qanc,t1_f50m7f4,1571931271.0,">People don't think of it as infantilizing and demeaning, but it is, and I very much believe that when someone's first impression of you and reaction to you is ""Oh, a kid/teenager/so childlike/aww, you're so cute,"" it absolutely has an effect on how they treat you, and a lot of people don't realize how bad that can be.

I'm 5'2"", 30 and babyfaced. I've found in general even when people discover I'm not a child, just because I'm short and look younger, they still treat me that way. Not quite like I'm five years old or anything but they definitely talk down to me. I get it a lot less now so maybe I'm finally starting to look more my age, haha. It's still just really weird to me that looking young/being short= mentally immature to a lot of people."
movies,f50nqqd,t1_eykvuf6,1571930189.0,">i guess the thing im sad about the most is that there are more and more tv series and films coming out set in the 60s or 80s because it’s popular. and it feels like they’re relying on having the era make the film enjoyable?

You've hit the nail on the head with that one. Sometimes I feel like the focus is more on the setting and nostalgia than developing the characters and at times even the story. It's beginning to be a blueprint more and more movie/TV developers are using. Set in 60/80s/pretty much anything but present day? Check. Include lots of (at times irrelevant) references to things from that time to keep fueling that sweet nostalgia? Check. Kids riding around on bikes? Check. Kids independently solving a mystery? Check. I love Stranger Things but it has a lot to answer for."
AskReddit,f3ox17o,t3_dh8vo0,1571031973.0,"A dog toy that was supposed to glide along the floor after you push it. Supposedly works on all surfaces, tried it on hardwood floor only for it to wobble on the spot. This was from an as seen on TV store so I guess it's hit and miss with those. But if they could make it work for the commercial, why not just make one that actually.. works? I don't think it would be even be that hard to design something like that. Just an absolute ripoff, I was surprised there were any positive reviews at all. I'm guessing they were either fake or those with dogs that genuinely got use out of it were happy to attack the toy without it needing go glide first. It has a squeaker so I could see a big dog going for it. My little dogs just sniffed it and walked away, which would be funny if it weren't so infuriating."
FanFiction,f27696i,t1_f273q6d,1570031490.0,"I feel like because some might have thanked that person for their advice (like you know, the students who actually NEED it), they've gotten it in their head they're the authority on all pieces of fiction and anyone should be grateful for their critiques. On the other hand, as a teacher, you would think they would understand you should be a bit more encouraging and at least pick out one positive so the person won't just want to quit. Yikes."
FanFiction,f2747nq,t3_dbx8u1,1570030344.0,"I would say there are too many factors to give a definitive answer. It depends on the fandom, website, what device people are reading on (as others have pointed out, maybe they read a pdf version then can't find the story online afterwards). A perfect example of how it can vary from fandom to fandom is the two fics I've posted. Both are multichapter and solely on AO3. One is for a huge fandom that has numerous pairings and genres of stories. The first page changes every day. As in, you could post your fic in the morning and by night it would be several pages back from all that has been posted since then. The fic of mine in this fandom has a modest following. Every chapter has a few comments, I think one or two has zero. Keep in mind I posted this one first and it is lengthy.

Enter fic two for a different fandom. The source material is complete so the fandom is a little slower than it used to be, although it was never as big as the above fandom. But people still post semi-frequently. However, I could post something and it would stay on the first page for a week or two, easily. People don't necessarily post every day but someone will post at least once or twice a week. Anyway, my fic for this fandom has recieved more comments, kudos and basically everything than the other fic. But since we're talking about comments, I'll focus on that. Why have more people commented? The fic is complete and now when people comment, since there's no more to come, they pretty much just say they enjoyed the fic and hope I write more for the fandom. In this particular fandom's case, I would say people are enthusiastic about this story because I updated extremely fast, (it was already written, I just needed to edit it chapter by chapter prior to posting). Not to be mean but the quality has dropped a bit for the fandom overall so I think that's another reason people have felt compelled to comment. This is a fandom of dark subject matter yet a lot of the fics have been light lately, so I think people were drawn to something closer to the source material. In this fic's case, commenting is clearly a good idea since I outright said I have more fics to post. Some of the comments are people asking for me to post those stories.

Anyway, before I ramble any more, I'll just say there are a lot of factors to consider. I think overall it depends on the fandom but of course advertising and using social media can probably help as well (I don't do that so I don't know but from what I've seen others do this and it works for them)."
