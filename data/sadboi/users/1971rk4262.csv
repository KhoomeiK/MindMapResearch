If you do go, you will probably be his slave whether you want to be or not. Now I have done some stuff where I was tied to a bed, or handcuffs and such but it was with guys that I knew I could trust. This guy could really hurt you and there would be nothing you could do about it. 

Plus posting those pictures of you online without your consent, is against the law. Forcing you to walk in and say that you consent to everything that is about to happen when you don't consent to it, is rape. You don't want to be raped, I know. If he decides to fuck you , which it sounds like he that is what he's planning on and your a virgin, he could really hurt you. He could rip your anus requiring surgery. 

My suggestion, and your not going to like it, but it's about the only way your going to get out of this in one piece, is to contact a police detective, and let them tell you how to handle it. It might out you, but it's better than getting outed by being rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery on your asshole, so you don't bleed to death.  Or having him expose you later on after he's beat you half to death while you are tied to the bed, then dumping you on the street, or in the woods to be a dead man.

AskReddit,fr2wo86,t3_gm5lnf,1589845352.0,"My parents were spanked, their parents were spanked, and so forth back generations. I was spanked, I spanked my kids. When I spanked my kids I did it the same way my parents did me, first it was a last resort, other punishments for the same infraction had come first, except for a few major things, stealing, hitting another child, erc... Second I was sat down and explained what I did wrong (again), and what other punishments had already happened, why it was wrong, why I was getting the spanking, finally after the spanking, they wrapped their arms around me, until I no longer hated them. Then they talked soothingly to me another few minutes before letting me go. I can tell you I never made that mistake again, it wasn't a temporary punishment, it did more to change my behavior than any other punishment. Let me also say it was a spanking, it was not abuse, there were no bruises, welts, or any thing similar. 

I said my kids earlier, technically they are my step-kids, when I met them they were 9 and 11, and they were out of control. My wife did not believe in spanking at the time, I kept telling her they needed a spanking. After on extremely bad episode she told me if I wanted to spank them go ahead, and I took over the disciplining of them. It took me just over six months and they were the best behaved  kids, not only that but they cared more about me than they did either of their bio-parents. That was 25 years ago and it's still the same way, if they need something, or if they need advice, or to talk about something, they call me not their mom, when they come in the house they make a point to hug me before her, and they cut their father out of their life years ago, actually told him that he wasn't their dad, I was.

A good old spanking is not the evil it's made out to be. If it's a spanking and not abuse. You can't trust every piece of scientific evidence you come across when it comes to human behavior. A spanking is not violent, it's a controlled reaction to a bad behavior. Mot of the people that say they were spanked and it made them hate their parents, were not spanked, it was something more. A good spanking is designed to give the kid a healthy respect for the parent, and in turn help them to love the parent, because the parent is doing it out of love."
gay,fr2tm0e,t3_gm3kq3,1589843649.0,"First thing you need to do if figure out if he is straight or gay or what. Does he know that you are gay? If so what is his attitude about it? If he's straight do your best to keep it to yourself, unless you just can't stand it any more. There have been several times in my life that I fell for a straight friend. I kept it a secret until I felt I was just going to burst if I didn't tell him. If he had a good attitude toward my sexuality, meaning he would joke around about us having sex, or getting married or stuff like that, I would sit him down and tell him how I felt, but that I would never do anything to make him uncomfortable. I just needed him to know for my mental health. Usually I could go back a week or so later and tell him that just telling him made my desire to partially or completely go away. 

Although there were a couple of guys that joked around with me, maybe even slapping my ass or something, I mean they were completely open to my sexuality, until I confessed my feelings, and then they just stopped talking to me, afraid I would make a move on them. It was their loss. Then again there were two guys that a year or so after the last time I talked to them, showed up at my house wanting sex, so that was great. But your looking at less than 5% that was willing to have gay sex, and they both had other reasons other than just me being interested in them. They had both had some trauma from their ex-girlfriends, and just wanted to play without a relationship, and really didn't want anything to do with females right then. 

That's my experience, yours may be different, just thought I'd share, I'm open to questions."
BisexualMen,fr1czm3,t3_gm18ti,1589817548.0,"I had more than my share of male sexual partners for about 7 years. I am not only bisexual, but I'm polyamorous which basically means you are not monogamous, you have several different partners at the same time, Of course all your partners know about all your other partners is all ethical. I had dated a few females during this time, but then one day I met this wonderful woman, and wanted more with her. As usual before even starting to date her I explained my whole past so she could make up her own mind about it. She said she did not care about all that but I would have to be monogamous to date her. I said OK. That was 25 years ago, I love her more than ever, we have 3 wonderful kids. I have desires for sex with a man quite often, I've even been tempted a few times, and I knew she would never find out. However I HAVE NEVER CHEATED on her and I never will. I will not do anything to jeopardize what  I have with her. 

As has been noted already, straight people cheat, gay people cheat bi people cheat, and so on, every sexuality has people that are going to cheat no matter how good they have it. But every sexuality has people that are not going to cheat no matter what. For instance I would give anything to have sex with Chris Hemsworth (Thor), I mean anything, except my marriage or my wife. So I suggest, you just sit back and watch what happens, and let her live her life, because if you try to interfere, she is going to be mad at you, and possibly hate you for doing it. She may even stop talking to you. Now if he's verbally, or physically abusive then offer to help, but if she wants to stay with him, you really can't stop her, not until she wants out."

AskReddit,fqvhckb,t3_gkpda1,1589677281.0,"I've posted this on reddit a couple of times, but here it is again, just because it fits. Back in the early 90's I worked for Domino's pizza, when this happened I was an assistant manager, but we had to deliver sometimes too. This night, it just after 11:00, I made a delivery to a house in one of our middle income neighborhoods. I get to the house and there is not a light on. If the porch light wasn't on were supposed to go to a payphone and call the number on the order, that was to prevent robberies. I never did that, I would just go ahead and go to the door.

But this night, I sat in my car a minute, and I just had a gut feeling, and I always listen to my gut. So I drove back two blocks to a payphone, and called the number, it was disconnected. I decided to wait just a minute before making the second call we were suppose to make. If they didn't answer the second time, we were supposed to go back to the store. As I stood there, I noticed a Pizza Hut drive through, but really didn't think about it, you spot each other while on the road. I call back, still disconnected. For some reason I decide to return to the house, and just see if someone comes to the door.

I get back, and realize the Pizza Hut car is sitting in my driveway, I think ""what the hell"". I turn in the long driveway, that is lined on the left side by tall evergreen tree/shrub things. I immediately notice there is something big on the ground next to the open drivers door of the Pizza Hut car. I pull up behind him and park, and realize that it's the driver. I decide he must have had a heart attack or something, so I run up to see what I can do to help. When I get to him, I realize his skull has been caved in so bad, I can actually see his brains. I run back to my car and lock the door, I drive like 90 mph those two blocks to the payphone, and call the cops, then I call my store and tell them what is going on, and have them call Pizza Hut. 

I wait for the cops to come through, and I go back. Eventually the detective comes over to talk to me. He tells me that first in the bushes next to the driveway, they found a realty sign, the power is off, and the house is completely empty. They also found two sets of footprints in the bushes. It appears they ordered from both places and waited for whoever got there first to rob. I was first but because I didn't get out of the car, they had to wait on Pizza Hut to show up. If only I got out of the car the first time, that would have been me laying on the ground dead. For some reason, a gut feeling perhaps, I did not do what I normally did. I never knocked on another door without the front porch light on, unless I knew the customer really well."
AskReddit,fquxo7v,t1_fqtn08o,1589666116.0,"Mine's not as serious or long as yours. But I went to bed one night at my house. When I woke up the next morning I was as a friends house, in the spare bedroom. They had laid out some swear clothes for me, I put them on and went downstairs. Where they filled me in on the events of the previous evening. 

Seems at one o'clock I walked in their house, I was sleep walking, but I walked in and sat down on the couch between her mom and dad, her brother was sitting directly across from me. Here's the funny part, I was but naked, since I slept in the nude. Her dad told me that he was jealous, and her brother agreed, he was too. 

Now the scary part, I drove across town, through at least 7 red lights, and 6 turns, through all that traffic. How I stopped when I was supposed to, and turned where I was supposed to, I'll never know. There were a couple turns where there was no light, so I was turning across traffic on a busy road, and I didn't turn in front of anybody. Streets where people parked on the street, and I had to dodge those cars. 

I never slept nude after that. I had a problem with sleepwalking most of my life, but as far as I know that was the only time I ever slept-drove. Just luckily her family thought it was funny, and didn't freak out when I walked in, and especially when I sat down next to her mom. My friend, had slept walked some so they knew what it was right away. Although they did give me hell for over a year. Her dad kept telling me that if I came over naked again, his wife was going to get the hots for me because he didn't measure up."

GayChristians,fqtdw48,t3_gkm8qj,1589636975.0,"In Romans 1:26-27, 31 When it says  even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: [**27**](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm)And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men , 31 without natural affection. The use of the word natural means that these were not homosexual people, they were straight people that had chosen to live as gay people, It would be the same as if a gay person left their natural sexuality to be  straight. It would be leaving the person's natural sexuality. 

Here is what I was told about the story of the Roman Centurion in Romans 8:5-13, it seems that the centurions servant was what was called a ""pias"", which is a young teenage boy used as a sex slave. But, it was a servant that he loved, he wasn't just a slave anymore. So the Centurion walked up in a meeting of Jesus and the pharisees, and said ""my servant is dying"". Jesus of course new immediately what was going on, but what was His reaction? Did he say ""Get away from me faggot"". No, He immediately said, ""Let's go to your house, so I can heal your servant"". The Centurion, said, I'm not worthy for you to come to my house, just speak the word from hear and my servant will be healed"". Jesus, said this queer has better faith than all of Israel. No He didn't, He just said ""you have better faith than all of Israel"".  In other words Jesus was willing to heal the gay man's play toy, and then complimented him on his faith. Not one time did he condemn the Centurion, or turn him away. That tells me that Christ accepts homosexuality. If you go back to the original Greek and Hebrew writings you will find that most of the verses that condemn homosexuality, have been mistranslated, and therefore do not actually condemn a loving gay relationships. I've heard that the verses in Leviticus are not talking about a loving gay relationship, but the Israelite's were starting to copy the Amelikites in that they had men, some were slaves, some owed money, some their families were starving and the only work they could find was that were forced to work as prostitutes at the temple's.  

Here is a link to a video by Matthew Vines, he's a young guy but very intelligent, he has several degrees, in Biblical studies. He's kind of dry but the information he delivers is very interesting, and he explains all the verses that ""condemn"" homosexuality very well.

 [http://www.matthewvines.com/transcript/](http://www.matthewvines.com/transcript/) 

Put all this information together, and it can only mean that being gay is not wrong. The way some people straight and gay, live is wrong, but just being gay and being in a relationship is not wrong."
cars,fqsh15a,t3_gkjunm,1589607053.0,"One thing I want to mention is, I live in MS, it snows here about once every 10 years, I'm talking about an amount large enough to do anything. But the second winter after I got my license we had an ice storm, the ice was about 8 inches thick, I had to take a shovel and dig the ice away from my drivers door before I could open it, and I took my car and went out in a soybean field, and taught myself to drive on ice. That was 40 years ago, and I've always kept it between the ditches when we had ice and snow. What I'm suggesting is, if you don't have a field you can get in, have someone drive you to a large parking lot. So you can drive around on the ice and snow until you are comfortable and you know what your van is going to do. 

The thing about the field is it was big enough that I could get it up to 60 mph, and slam on the brakes, and let it do donuts until it stopped. And all sorts of other stuff, I was having fun, but I also learned how to pull it out of a slide, how to make it go straight when the back-end wanted to get loose. What happened when I went to start off, and all I could do was spin, how to rock it loose. I'm sure you already understand how tricky driving on ice and snow is, so this is a good way of learning how to drive on it safely. A parking lot will work, but you can't get the speed up you can in a field, and you aren't going to hurt anything if it gets away from you, because you've got enough room to stop before reacting the edges. That is my first idea, I'll probably be back in the morning with a couple more."

He can and will speak to you in different ways. Usually it was when I was at my lowest, when I was most desperate for an answer. Or when I had prayed for an answer, then lit it sit because I had the faith that God was going to answer, so I was at peace with the situation. 

Then there was one time, I was running from God, trying to get as far a way as possible. I was at a party and drunk off my tail end. When suddenly I heard this voice say ""pray, pray for protection, pray harder than you've ever prayed"". I knew immediately who it was, I did not hesitates, I started praying for protection. I didn't know what I needed protection from, but I prayed, and asked protection for the whole house and every one in it.

I'm also a very feminine man, I happen to be bi not gay, but around here at that time no one had ever heard the term bi. But since I was feminine that must mean I was gay. So my whole grade, and some in the grade above, and below me were out to get me. All because their parents were homophobes. Some of these had been my friends before this time. 

My family was not only homophobic, but they were racist also, which meant I was racist because that's all I knew until one day, when several bullies were giving me a hard time, and a usual I was getting up in their face, and all of a sudden this black guy that I knew but wasn't friends with, walked up and simply said ""leave him alone"". He was a man of few words.. He just didn't think it was right that they were harassing me. They got mad, and one of them took a swing at him, and he beat up all 5 of them no problem. We became decent friends after that, but had nothing in common to build a friendship on. But since then I have done my best to not be racist, I don't allow myself to be. But at times it does slip out, no matter how hard I try.

Then in the sixth grade my best friend had a sleepover for his birthday, we were going to spend the night in his tree-house.

Then one of them suggested we play strip poker, I had to turn my head so they wouldn't see me smile. I said ""not my thing but if ya'll want to"". Then after a little while another one suggested we play poker for blowjobs, again I had to turn me head. Again I said ""not my thing but whatever all of you want"". Then we stopped playing cards, and just did anal. Got to school the following Monday and one of them had decided to treat me with respect, on became a decent friend, and two were now my best friends, and even told the other bullies I was off limits, I was under their protection."

He got my license and my insurance info, he was chewing me out for doing 2 mph over the limit like I was doing 20 or so over, he looked at it, grabbed his flashlight and looked back at me, back at my license, then the straight guy in the back seat, leaned up between the front seats, and in the voice that was so much deeper than his normal voice, and said ""Damn your hot""! Then passed right back out.

Me and the straight guy sitting up front, put our heads in our hands, and said, ""we're going to jail for sure now"".

Christmas is the worst. I don't know why, I really don't understand it. I just remember being about 10 y/o I was playing outside, so it was summertime, and I got to thinking ""oh hell, it's almost Christmas time, I just don't want to deal with all that"".  I've hated it ever since. 

After years of begging my mom and wife to just leave me out of the whole thing, and even offering to do the get together and meal thing, if they would leave me out of the gift giving thing, and them both refusing. So I was left each year being tortured opening gifts that I really did not want, not that I didn't want anything, but I did not want that specific item. One year, my wife was hinting around to see if I wanted a particular item, she is horrible at that kind of thing, and I specifically told her several times I did not want it, do not buy it. What's the first thing I started to unwrap, you guessed it, I as soon as I saw what it was, I saw red. I stopped mid tear on the wrapping, and sat it down, and refused to unwrap anything else. 

Went to my moms for brunch, then presents, I just neatly stacked all my gifts up next to my chair, without unwrapping any of them. We loaded the car up to go home, and my wife asked me if I was going to get my gifts, I said ""their not mine, I don't know who's they are"". Again she was pissed, mom was standing there and was hurt. I was sorry, I didn't want to hurt either of them, or piss off either of them. If only they had listened to me, I realize they did not understand just how much it hurt me to open gifts, no matter how much I tried to explain it, and it did hurt me. I've lost people close to me die that didn't hurt as bad as opening gifts. But for my peace of mind I had to do something. 

I know some people call me selfish, I say they were selfish for not allowing me the one gift I had asked, no begged for for years, to not get anything. It's not my fault they were too selfish to listen to me. Although the last two years my mom was alive, I did let her get me gifts, I'm glad I did even though it still hurt, but looking back it was worth it, for her happiness. Now every 2 to 4 years I let my wife get me gifts, that's about as much as I can take. 

Although the agreement has been small inexpensive gifts. Last year, her and my sons went in together to get me a TV. I first told them to take it back, it was a discounted, non-returnable, I think that just what they told me, to keep it. So I told them as far as I was concerned it was a family tv, not mine, and if they didn't like it, they could put it in the garbage, because I did not want it. Yeah I was a jerk, I admit it, but small and inexpensive does not equal a tv."

When I first started at my pain clinic, they referred me to a sports medicine doc, just to see if he could help me. So I go in for the appt. fill out all the paperwork. Wait, go to the back wait some more, the nurse comes in and does her thing, wait some more the doc comes in, looks at my chart and says ""First of all you can't have fibromyalgia because it doesn't exist. Second only women can get it."" 

That pissed me off beyond pissed off. I started yelling at him, I said ""first of all, it doesn't exist, but women can get it, you just contradicted your self, so which the F- is it?"" He started backing out of the room, I followed him, I was still yelling, I was yelling loud enough the people in the lobby could hear me. I told him he was a piss poor doctor, and should not be practicing, I kept asking him which was it, it doesn't exist or only women can get it. I asked him when the last time he read up on fibro that something like 30% (I don't remember what that number was at that time) of people with it are men, and continued talking about his bedside manor, how rude, and disrespectful he was, and just all sorts of other stuff. 

I finally backed him up to the reception desk, and the secretary said she was calling the police. I told her to call the police, because I was leaving and would never be back. Then I said oh yeah you better not even think about billing me for this, because I got absolutely no service, so I'm not paying a dime, and will tell my insurance the same thing., As I walked into the waiting room there was 6 people standing there, 4 of them walked out with me, they said if he was that bad they didn't want to see him.  

That is my horrible doctor story. Hope you enjoyed it. Yes, I have always been one to stand up for myself, I will stand toe to toe with anybody I think is doing me wrong. I told the pain clinic what had happened, they said they would never send anybody to him again. A couple months later I noticed his office was closed, it was in the same building with my pain clinic, and I had to walk past it when I went in. I don't know what happened, but I laughed anyway, I like to think it was my fault, but more than likely, he just moved to a bigger practice."

ParanormalEncounters,fqhscup,t1_fqdxiog,1589383508.0,"I am so sorry it took me so long to get back to you, I've just been real busy. So let me try to answer your questions. 

1. It's actions, if all it does is make a little noise, it's probably ok. But if it's scaring you, or bothering you, keeping you awake and stuff, you probably don't want it around even if it is ok. But if it starts intentionally doing things to scare you, such as standing over you while your asleep and then waking you up, throwing things, Screeching, growling and such it's probably an evil spirit. 

2 That depends, if it is a poltergeist, it can hurt people, a demon can possess people. Sometimes it takes a long time before you realize it that evil because they will take a while to build up their activity to that level. Also there has to be a lot of fear in the person for them to be possessed. 

3. It may not be that it wants YOUR attention specifically, but it could be that you have a sensitivity, or a connection to the paranormal, which makes it easy for it to get your attention. Spirits know who is sensitive and then target that sensitivity. That's not to say they won't target someone that isn't sensitive, but they just go for the easiest target.  

4.You will know. I can't describe it correctly, it's just a feeling I get. It's like a peace comes over me, or just a knowledge that permission has been granted. You just know when it's done. That's the best I can tell you.

Spend a couple days in prayer to get yourself prepared and to get a connection to God set up and in place, so when you decide to confront the spirit, your prayer will go through quick and effectively. As I said, be confident that confronting the spirit is going to work, and you are going to drive it out. Be as confident as you can, being new some doubt will be normal, but just make yourself be confident. The night you confront the spirit, you may have to ask for permission and authority maybe 3 or 4 times before you get an answer. That could be the effectiveness of your prayer, or it could be that God wants to make sure that you  are determined to do this, and you have the resolve to see it through. Whatever the reason, don't get discouraged if it takes a little while to hear back. 

Good luck, let me know what happens. Don't feel bad if you are not able to drive it out, your new, and you may not have the gift, but it's worth a shot."

If you have confidence in yourself you may not know what to say, but you will be brave enough to say something. Saying something is better than not saying anything, especially since you will be able to fake it good enough that it sounds like you know what your talking about.

Having confidence in yourself will also allow you to get credit for your work, instead of somebody stealing it. The best way I know of to get confidence, is to look at yourself at what you know and what you can do, and your accomplishments, that will how you that you deserve to have confidence. Then what you do is you fake it until you make it. Just pretend that you are confident, and start speaking up. Easier said than done, but I know you can do it. After you've spoke up a few times, it will get easier to do. The easier it gets the more confidence you will have.

internetparents,fqdx1sz,t3_gi0c1d,1589298080.0,"It basically works the same way as natural gas if you've ever used that. First a truck will come and and fill the tank. (Around here typically you have a 500 gal. tank, but they only put in 350 gal). On the water heater you may have to light the pilot light, newer ones you don't typically. The stove there shouldn't be a pilot, it's all electronic now, if it's an old stove it may have 2 pilots one for the eyes, one for the oven. If it's central heat it may or may not have a pilot, if it's the wall heaters, they will each have a pilot. Unless it's a very old drafty house you will be surprised just how much, and how fast they will heat, and once you turn it off, the heat stays in the house forever, I love those things. Anyway check with your landlord about what has a pilot and what doesn't. 

To light the pilots, I get one of those long grill lighters, that way I can get in there to them, sometimes they are sometimes hid up in there where you can't reach them. But, you light the pilot, then when you need to turn the appliance on, all you have to do is turn it on. Now when you get the tank filled, it is a rather large expense, I would suggest putting money aside in an envelope or something each month, so it's not such a big hit to your bank account. But as has been mentioned in the long run it's cheaper than most any other form of fuel/electricity. That should be all you need to know but if you have any more questions, just let me know..

ParanormalEncounters,fqc30it,t3_gi0z0p,1589249069.0,"Poltergeists are the only spirit other than demons that can move things, however regular spirits can cause noise, and some of the stronger ones can even do things like wind the snow globes. I've seen them do it. For the record I'm a sensitive with some medium abilities. possibly more than I realize. I have expelled numerous bad/evil spirits, 3 demons, and secured a home for a lot of good spirits. Most of those I had to convince to settle down so they didn't scare the homeowner any more. I'm not going to say I've seen it all, but I have seen a lot. You may be the only one experiencing these things because you could have a natural ability to detect spirits, so they are trying to get your attention. 

You mentioned grabbing your crucifix, so I'm assuming your somewhat religious, next time they start, get your crucifix, and you can actually pray this before hand, and get your request in, but make sure to do it right before you do this, pray ask God to give you the power and authority to use Jesus name to rebuke the spirits, Pray to God for those things, not Mary, not one of the saints, God Himself. Keep praying until you feel you get a yes answer, and only when you get a yes answer from God Himself. At that point say with as much confidence as you can come up with, out loud, doesn't have to be a yell, just loud enough to be heard, Then say, ""Jesus Christ commands you to leave this place and do not return"". You may have to repeat it a couple of times until you are saying it with enough confidence for them to actually listen to you.  Any bad/evil spirit should leave immediately, good/friendly spirits can withstand Jesus name a little better, but in the end can't hold out forever, they must leave also. But just because it doesn't leave doesn't mean it's friendly, you may have not have had enough confidence behind your voice, or any number of other things, you being new at this. But, if you get the power and authority from God to use Jesus name, then you let Jesus command them to leave, they should leave. No matter what you do, DO NOT command them to leave under your own power, DO NOT say I command you in Jesus name, that's you commanding them, only say Jesus Christ commands you. See the difference in those three? Wording it wrong and you commanding, could lead to your possession. But as long as you say it like I told you, then you are safe, because it's Jesus commanding them. 

Just remember

1. Get authority and power to use Jesus name first
2. Speak with confidence
3. Speak out loud
4. Only say Jesus Christ commands you
5. You may have to repeat it a couple of times
6. You may have to repeat it another couple night to get all of them
7. Be sure to pray same prayer first before every time"

I promise that I will not cross the line of our friendship, but if you ever decide that you want to try a guy, just let me know (laugh and make that a joke)"" But make sure he understands that he has nothing to worry about from you. If he's a good enough friend, he will understand, or if he's LGBTQ friendly in general not just you, then he will be ok. Your friendship should be ok. Then again it might really freak him out and he'll think your hitting on him, and never speak to you again. It's your choice if you want to take the chance."
ParanormalEncounters,fqa7fvq,t3_gh983r,1589214156.0,"I agree another house blessing is in order. It sounds like you might be a sensitive or medium, this is gifts you will have to learn to control. You have the power to drive away these creatures, you just have to learn. I don't really know how to teach you, because I don't really know how I learned, but I taught myself sort of, when something came up I just knew what to do. So I feel like you probably already know, you just don't know that you know. 

I know one key thing is confidence, and being fearless. When you encounter one of these beings, don't get scared, at least don't show fear they smell fear. Instead stand up tall and just say ""NO you are not doing this to me, go away and don't come back"", and mean it, don't just say it, mean it. Be forceful, the more scared you get, means the more confident you need to get, until it leaves. Praying is also a good thing to do. Say a short prayer before telling it no go away, just ask for the power and authority to tell command it. Actually the best thing to do is pray and ask permission and authority to use Jesus name, the tell the entity ""In Jesus name, go away and never come back. I'm not commanding you, I have no authority, but Jesus does, and He is the one commanding you"".  

But try that and see how that goes, and let me know DM me if you need to."
BisexualMen,fqa0umi,t3_gh8f8b,1589210778.0,"OK, let me answer what I can

1. Yes it's very normal to be uncomfortable with your masculinity. For instance I am a very feminine man, I did not see a way to actually be with a woman. In high school I dated a few girls, most were overweight and had low self-esteem, but  on women I prefer a little overweight. The others that were pretty, for example, one had a banquet to go to, and I had had a crush on her all year but didn't think I had a chance, her date cancelled on her about 3 days before her banquet, so I offered to escort her, and she was really grateful, but that's as far as it went, I assumed it was because of my femininity, but  it could have been because she just didn't see me that way. But I have been married to a woman for 25 years, she overlooked my mannerisms, and did not care I was bisexual.
2. I knew before I ever had sex, that I wanted to be a bottom. When I was 12, I bottomed and topped the same night and loved being a bottom not so much being a top, after that, all I could think about was having another boy on top of me. 
3. I think this one has been covered with the links given. But I never did anything but go to the bathroom, and clean the outside real good, never had a problem."
ParanormalEncounters,fq9z6zg,t3_ghh3g3,1589209895.0,"It sounds like you might be a sensitive, basically it means being able to detect when spirits are around, and being able to interact with them in some minor way. So you are going to notice things that most people will not. 99% of the time those spirits, even though some want to scare you none will be able to hurt you. Although there is that random case where it can, but that is so infrequent that it's not worth worrying about. That is my experience as a sensitive anyway. Don't let them scare you, push those away, the one's that basically ignore you, just ignore them and let them do their thing. The one's that seem friendly, be friendly back, the one's that try to scare you, tell them to talk to the hand. and walk away. If it actually tries to hurt you, then sage your apartment, maybe get a religious leader of your choice to come in and say a prayer, or chant something whatever they do. I mean you could sage or get your religious leader to come in now and rid the apartment now, but these will just be replaced with others later, unless you sage every so often. Best thing is just to learn to live with the spirits you have, as long as they are not bad/evil. I have three constant spirits in my house, plus a protective spirit that attached to me in 1993, plus the occasional stray spirit that comes through. I've got used to the spirits I have, I know their bumps and stomps, and speech, and if they get too loud for me, I can come in the living room and ask them to quieten down, and they will. My wife notices them every now and then, and makes a comment about them being active, and ignores the rest, and she doesn't like anything paranormal. That would be my suggestion, but I'm not you, you might prefer to sage every month if so go for it, but you'll be running for the rest of your life, because every time you visit a friend and they have a spirit you will know it, every time You walk in a dress shop and they have a spirit you will know it. You might as well get  used to blocking them out. Or just dealing with them as you run into them."
internetparents,fq9wni9,t3_ghbf3r,1589208504.0,"My youngest son was 17 the last time I used a belt on him, I spanked my kids, I did not beat them, there is a difference, one is done out of love the other out of hate. My kids knew better than to hit me or their mom. That would have resulted in some severe punishment. You may not like corporal punishment, but no hate in the comments please, you will not change my mind, it worked on my grandparents, great-grandparents, my parents, me and my siblings, it worked on my kids, there was no child abuse, we didn't hit that hard, there were never any marks left. 

Now I do think what your mom hit you for was rather minor, and should not have happened, depending on how hard she hit you. You didn't say so I have no idea, but if it was just a little tap, you had no reason to get upset, if it was hard, I don't blame you for being upset, but that did not give you the right to hit her back. 

I do agree with her that YOU need to get your paper finished right now, but cutting the internet if you don't get it done is rather harsh. So is taking all your belongings, I was always good at taking the PlayStation or Xbox for a few days until the boys corrected their behavior, or not allowing them to go to something they had planned on and wanted to go to for a while. Then again, there was like one time WWE came to town, the first time it had ever came to town, and they had had tickets for 6 months or so, that was a once in a lifetime thing, and it would have been wrong to tell them they couldn't go, so I let them go and just added a few days to their grounding to make up for it, they were happy with that. I was strict, but not overly strict, I would help them with their homework, but there was no way in hell I would do it for them. So if your mom has been doing your algebra, and looking up your citation's and such, then you really need to be grateful to her. Yes she overreacted, but you did too. She has apologized, even if it wasn't sincere, it's time you apologized, and learned how to do your own schoolwork, you don't learn anything by her doing it. When you apologize be as sincere as you can, then maybe in a couple of weeks you can give a completely sincere apology, until then do the best you can. Maybe both of you will learn something from this."
internetparents,fq9ty6x,t3_gh9a9a,1589206984.0,"Technically, what you are supposed to do if you have trouble with an immediate boss/supervisor/manager whatever, is to leap frog over them and go to their immediate boss/supervisor/manager whatever. Depending on what rank your immediate boss/whatever holds, HR may be your next stop, always follow the chain of command. If you don't get satisfaction from the next higher up, then go up one more, then one more, until you reach the executive director/plant manager/owner/ whoever. Then you can either find a new job, and/or hire a lawyer.

But to answer your question, if you feel like you have been done wrong, you can go and report it, period, there really is no waiting period. However, after the first time I would wait and see if it happens again, it could have just been a lapse in judgment, and as someone else mentioned, keep detailed notes on what/when/where/and how. So that if you do have to report this, you have your information, and your not trying to remember things. I've done it both ways, and let me tell you it was so much easier with notes. If there are any witnesses, willing to go with you that would be even better."
AskReddit,fq9s6xs,t3_ghadae,1589205949.0,"This doesn't exactly fit the theme of the thread but someone else touched on it so I'll tell mine, oh and it's a long one, I'll keep it as short as possible.

I am a bi man just so you know. I had a party at my house one night, and a good friend of mine brought Greg a friend of his. This guy was large to say the least, he was 6'6"", 300 pounds, so he was rather overweight. Me an him actually didn't get along too well. I mean we were cordial enough, just never be friends type deal.

So about a year later, I got off work early one Friday night, in this town the only thing to do on a Friday night is leave, which is what all my friends had done. So I stopped at a convenience store to pick up a few things. Who do I run into but Greg. It was the usual be nice to each other despite not liking each other, and I mentioned that I was headed home to a empty house,(any other time there would be 10-20 people at my house, that's just how things went) he suggested I go to his place, right behind the store and have a few drinks and watch a movie on the vcr (yes this was in the early 90's). I thought about it a minute, I didn't really want to spend time with this guy, but drinks and a movie sounded better than an empty house.

So I went in, and went to the bathroom, when I came out he had two drinks fixed for us, so I picked out a movie, and sat down and started drinking. I got about 4 swallows, said ""Oh Shit I'm Fucked"" and tried to stand up to leave, and promptly fell on the floor, in a heap. My body was completely loose. He picked up my 98 pound body carried me to the bedroom, took my clothes off, and crawled on top of me. I never actually went to sleep, I'm sure I passed out occasionally for a few seconds at a time, but mostly I was completely aware of what was going on, I just could not move to fight back. The one big thing I remember is thinking ""He's actually trying to damage my body"" because of how hard and rough he was, I mean seriously, he came down with his whole 300 pounds, the bed springs felt like they were stretching to the floor. After he was finished, I laid there about another hour until I could stand on my own, I got dressed, and went home, and hid in the back of my closet in a hidden door. When it came time to go to work the next morning, I knew I could not let anyone know, after all men can't be raped, and then I was always the strong one in the group, I was always the one ready to fight, and would, I never backed down from a confrontation. So I just found a place deep down inside to hide what happened, so nobody would ever know.

About 15 years later I was in an inpatient facility because of some unrelated depression, I overheard one of the nurses say that the girl coming in was there because she was raped, but she was unwilling to admit it, and was in severe depression and anxiety. Didn't think anything about it, until our first group session, this poor girl 18 y/o, was sitting in a chair with her knees pulled up to her chin, and she cried the whole hour we were in there. Finally I could not stand it any more, and I don't know why I said this but I did I said ""Emily, I don't know what's wrong with you, or what you've been through, but I do know that if I as a man can sit here and admit he was raped, there's nothing you can't tell us"". Even though everyone in there knew I was bi, I figured I had just lost every male friend in there. But she looked at me for a minute, and come running across the room, and met me, and we hugged for the longest time. 

Then she proceeded to tell us about what happened. When I left 5 days later she was doing wonderful. Oh and when I finally made it out of the group room into the common room, every one of the 10 straight guys there, gave me a hug and told me if I needed to talk or anything else, just to let them know. I was really touched, I could tell they really cared, and not just saying something. Since then I've really put this back in it's hiding place, except I took the door off the hinges, so there's no way to hide it anymore, but it's not easily visible either.

Sorry it's so long, if you read the whole thing thank you."

DadForAMinute,fq9lyse,t3_gh5vaf,1589201901.0,"Never stay with someone that doesn't treat you right, that's all there is to say about that, just don't do it. Now having said that, and unsure about what happend, and it's none of my business really, and you didn't mention just how old you are, so I'm guessing at a few things here. One thing you have to understand about guys especially the younger they are, we do some pretty stupid things. That doesn't mean we are insensitive jerks, it just means that sometimes we don't think before we act, and we hurt those we care about. So before making any major decisions about ending a relationship, think about it, or even before getting totally pissed at him, stop and think, could this be the problem, could he just be being an idiot at the moment. Because us guys are good at being idiots, if this is a good possibility give yourself time to calm down, and then talk to him about it. 

If he wants to get defensive and fight at this point, let him know your just trying to understand, if he insist on getting argumentative, he probably had bad intentions to start with, or he just doesn't like being questioned, either way I would think hard about staying with him, because something like that only gets worse. As I said to start with, yelling at you, berating you, putting you down in any way, any other kind of negative treatment, leave him immediately. Any kind of negative physical contact (hitting, pulling arms, slapping, thumping etc...) any of this definitely get the hell away from him any way you have to. Call a family member, call 911 whatever you need to do. But if you end every relationship with a man because he did something stupid, you'll end up either a lone, or as a lesbian, not that there's anything wrong with being a lesbian, I just don't think you are one."

I also see the shadow in the car, but I'm not convinced it's not someone sitting in the car. As mentioned by someone on a different sub, I noticed the ""eyes"" in the top right, but I think that's just the leaves. Someone else mentioned an old woman holding the ""Demon"" back, I see what could be a bunch of small faces, but again I think that's just the leaves, but could be wrong if nothing happened to your grandfather, it would suggest I am wrong. The ""shadow figure"" you are talking about in the middle, I think it's just a regular person, I think I can see what you are talking about, but I think it's just where that person is physically in the picture. 

Don't get me wrong I believe in demons, and such. I am a sensitive with medium tendencies that has battled enough to know they exist.

BisexualMen,fq8pwxy,t3_gh7gzs,1589172265.0,"Same situation here but I've been married for 25 years. Plus I was polyamorus, so going monogamous was different, I've done it before, just not this long.  But I love her with all my heart and will never do anything to come between us. But that does not mean I don't have my bi-cycle, at least once a month I want to be with a guy. 

Although at this point in my life, all I really want is just to cuddle. Take our shirts off and lay in bed, and just cuddle for an hour or so. But she won't even go for that, because she thinks cuddling will make us horny and we'll have sex. 

I told her before we started dating about my sexuality, she didn't care. But about 10 years into our marriage, I had a slight accident which caused a minor break in my spine, which in turn caused some minor nerve damage. Those nerves control you guessed it my penis. I now have erectile dysfunction. When it first happened, she got upset thinking I wanted to leave her for a man. Ever since then she has been real touchy about  me doing anything homosexual in nature. Like she knows I'm on reddit, she just doesn't know I'm on any of the gay subreddits. I hate to lie to her, but I have to have an outlet for my urges. 

So I completely understand what your are going through. Again, I will never do anything to jeopardize what I have with her, I love her too much, and she loves me too much, which is why she is so touchy about things. But I would be a fool to give her up."
