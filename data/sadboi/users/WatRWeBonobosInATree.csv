I love wearing jerseys to games my team isn’t playing at too. I know it gets weird looks sometimes, but to me it shows that I’m a hockey fan and I’m there for a good time. I like talking to visiting/transplant fans about their teams and love when people do the same for me. I wore a Caps jersey to Paul Kariya’s number retirement game at the Ponda because I wanted to show my support as a hockey fan, but there was no way in hell I was gonna buy something with the Ducks logo or draw attention to myself in teal. But I encountered another guy in a Sharks jersey and we chatted for a bit. Then some Caps fans in Kariya tee shirts came up to me saying that they were trying to blend in, but loved me representin.

On the plus side, I feel our barn has more brown people than the average hockey arena. I’m Filipino myself and regularly go to games with other Asians and Mexicans. We need to shake the stereotype that hockey’s a white sport. I have an uncle who’s an obnoxious Warriors fan constantly bagging on hockey as a white sport and I keep asking him, “Have you even been to a Sharks game?” (Spoiler: he hasn’t) Hispanic Heritage Night is one of the most well-attended games every year.

If it's later in the month, I honestly think she'll be fine holding off on buying clothes until the end of August. Your wedding is 4 months away. The shoes will almost certainly come back in stock before your wedding. If the dresses are long, no one will see the shoes anyway.

If in fact she is pregnant (which I find more and more plausible the more I read), her body can change a lot in 4 months. Unless you've seen a pregnancy test, you can't ""know for a fact"" that she's not pregnant. Nothing you've said completely rules out pregnancy. I saw your other comment about her snaps of her drinking wine, but according to my currently preggo friend, doctors are now giving the okay for pregnant women to drink one glass of soft(?) liquor a week. Not sure if that's the correct term, but things like beer, wine, cider, etc....you also don't know for sure that what she was drinking in the pics are alcoholic.

It sounds like your military background is amplifying the craziness that happens to anyone in the throes of wedding planning. I get it - wedding planning can drive even the most level-headed people bonkers. My husband is almost always the calm one in our relationship, but I had to talk him down from some groomzilla moments on multiple occasions while we were planning our wedding.

There's nothing wrong with telling her that she can't be in the wedding unless she has the specific dress and shoes you guys want, but I really hope you guys don't do it as aggressively as this post and your Reddit comments come off. And for the love of god, don't replace her! That's shitty to not only her, but to the ""backup"" bridesmaid as well. 

Sides can be uneven. We worked hard to keep sides even at the beginning. Conversations went like, ""I want to add ____ to my side. Do you have someone else you can add?"" In the end, one of my bridesmen turned out to be a flakey fair-weather friend (ex-friend now) who bailed literally the week of the wedding. I'm sure one girl would love to walk down the aisle with 2 guys. You could also have the men walk up to the altar with you and the women walk solo. There are options."

>Now she’s not coming to the bridal shower/bachelorette party anymore either. I thought maybe it was a money thing but it’s not because they spend a lot of money going on vacations and building a home gym etc.

Do you know for a fact that she isn't pregnant? Seriously, when was the last time either of you talked to her about anything other than the wedding? You still haven't answered that. Maybe you guys would know ""what her deal is"" if you stepped outside of your wedding planning bubble for a bit and really took the time to know what's going on in her life

From where I'm standing, it sounds like all you guys do is talk wedding logistics and hound her for excuses/justifications for her behavior with regard to wedding events. She is free to spend her money however she wants. Again, **NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR WEDDING MORE THAN YOU DO!!**

Honestly, I suspect she *is* pregnant and doesn't want to be the only one not drinking at the bach. Or maybe she's irritated that you guys do nothing but talk wedding stuff and wants a break.

 >We’re having a larger wedding party

 >***She wants to replace her*** with someone who will buy the dress and ***not try and be center of attention.***

>***I realize she’s a human being***, my sister just doesn’t realize his [sic] ***isn’t her wedding*** and ***she can’t have everything her own way.***

I'm failing to see how your sister holding off on buying the dress makes her a person who wants to be the center of attention and a person who wants to control your wedding. All of this just screams that you guys view your wedding party as ""picture perfect"" props. The people by your side should be your nearest and dearest, not people in pretty clothes. The shoes may accomodate swollen feet and the dresses may accomodate big bellies, but that doesn't make you and your FW's behavior less centered on pretty pictures than the human."
bridezillas,et7g1zx,t3_ca7zno,1562530650.0,"TBH, I think your FW is a 'zilla. Not for giving her a deadline.

But the whole ""get the dress by x date or I'll replace you with a bridesmaid who won't try to steal my thunder"" screams ""You're just a prop."" That's not how to treat your wedding party.

Your sister is probably stressed out about not being able to conceive as quickly as she wanted. Does your fiancée even talk to her about things other than the wedding? You and your fiancée need to recognize that she is a human being who doesn't care about your wedding as much as you guys do. No one does."
