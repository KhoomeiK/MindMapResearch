I finally transferred back to the main college I first started at while working as a paralegal full time. I maintained good grades, mainly A’s and B’s, with one C in Chemistry II. I graduated December 2019 with a BA in Law and Society, a BS in Criminal Justice, and a minor in Political Science. I pulled my GPA up to a 2.85. But in my major classes I easily had a 3.9 GPA. I still am a paralegal and I am planning on going to law school. It’s about what you decide to put into it. I wasn’t even diagnosed until 2017. So I got A’s and B’s unmedicated and undiagnosed.

I took Adderall IR at first. It made me excited, motivated, full of energy, talkative, and eased my anxiety. I even took it once before being diagnosed and had the same effect. Lazer focus on my math test, done in 5 minutes, smoked 5 cigarettes in 30 minutes. But the crash was hard, and quick. I never had a quiet brain on Adderall IR. It sped it up more. 

Then I took Vyvance. That shit....made me a zombie. I literally had no emotions. Only content. I wasn't mad, wasn't sad, wasn't excited, wasn't anything other than okay. I was extremely focused, and quiet. I got a lot done at work and with college, but I felt....odd, and hated it. I couldn't even cry, no sex drive, no impulses, nothing. It was too creepy and I got off of it. I slept way better at night and was exhausted getting home at 5 pm. 

Now, I'm on Adderall ER. This is a healthy medium. When it first kicks in or nearing the end, I get excited and talkative. When I get past that, I stay calm, motivated, and focused. But, I feel emotions, can be talkative, etc. 

Energy drinks make me really hyped, then I crash really hard and sleep. Same with soda, sugar, tea, coffee, and caffeine. Especially energy drinks though. I will be shaking, energized, all over the place, but then an hour later I crash really fucking hard and will need to sleep. It's been that way my entire life with those substances.

Honestly, I have struggled with college and school the entire time I've been alive. I never seem to put in enough ""effort."" Or so my teachers would say. I honestly didn't. I guess I was bored with most of high school. I never studied. I just didn't do homework, went to class, and would get A's and B's on my tests. But the homework fucked me up. I have a pretty sharp memory for certain pieces of information. Until I got to college. My first year I got a 1.11 GPA. Granted, I had a very abusive relationship, smoked a lot of marijuana, and barely went to class due to depression and having no direction. I dropped out. Lost 140 pounds of weight by breaking up with the psycho ex, and started working full time. 

I went back after 3 years. Finally knowing that I wanted to be a lawyer. Weird ADHD career choice, huh? It took everything I had, but I made straight A's and some B's. I'm graduating in December with 2 degrees, a minor, and a 3.0 GPA. I just forced myself to do it. I made a vision board, with pictures of Supreme Court Justices. I visualized what I wanted to do with my law degree. And that...that kept me going. Not only that but my fiancé was a huge part of me getting to where I am. 

He motivates me. Him and our future children. When I'm feeling like I can't do it...I think of them. I want them to one day look up to me and know that despite having a disorder, I did it. I don't want to let them down, don't want them to want for anything, and want to be someone they look up to. 

I do struggle, as my previous comment suggests. I mean I was 30 minutes late to work this morning. I am on Reddit rather than doing work. I procrastinate. I get very depressed. But, all in all, I'm successful and refuse to be anything less than extraordinary. 

One thing that's key is surrounding yourself with motivational, supportive people you can lean on. I am always here to message. I may not respond right away, but I will try my hardest to be there. 

Another thing is to write down where you can see it every day, a list of goals, wants, or needs. On your mirror, in your car, on your desk, etc. 

Affirmations. I tell myself every single day that I am capable. I am strong. I am worthy. I am beyond exceptional. I am good enough. They work. It's going to feel silly at first, but I look in the mirror and tell myself positive things. 

Last thing is...the second you feel you should do something, do it. Right then and there so the feeling doesn't go away. Go and fold your laundry. Go do the dishes. Go take a shower. Go do your paper. Go to the store. Do it. The very second the want hits you. 

Also, don't beat yourself up. Stop. You are human. You can't do everything. Sometimes getting out of bed is enough. Just because your to do list isn't done, doesn't mean it decreases your self worth. It's not a failure. It's a lesson. Maybe you need to ask for help, or make a smaller to do list. Either way, don't see yourself as a failure...bad...terrible...no good just because you couldn't get everything done.
