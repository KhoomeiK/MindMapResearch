I was in fourth grade and my school had a small band practice after school. When I say small, it was small, only half a dozen people or so. One girl mentioned that her relative had recently terminated an unhealthy/unwanted pregnancy. Me, growing up in a Catholic household with Republican parents, had some semblance of understanding that it sucked to have an abortion done.

Cue me saying “Hey, abort the abortion!” This was my autistic way of conveying “I’m sorry for her loss. We should get rid of abortion so moms don’t feel sad when they have to lose their kids that they love.”

The band director clearly didn’t understand this, because she said, “u/indigo-ld, that’s a horrible thing to say! Apologize right now.”

Of course I did, because an adult told me to, but to this day I get beet-red every time I think about it. I’m pretty sure the band director thought that I had *approved* of the abortion and was actively cheering it on. (I’m pro-choice now, but yeah actively cheering on someone who just terminated a pregnancy and was grieving over the loss of their would-be child is insensitive).

Tldr: I have autism and don’t understand emotions."
