Anyway, most times we would stay up super late in a room heated purely by two teenage boys and two computers from 1995. My mom was chill and never barged in on me/us in the morning, but HIS mom was...not so gentle or subtle. She always loudly knocked and busted open the door telling us to get up (for whatever reason at 9am on a Saturday). Until one morning she threw open the door while we were still sleeping on a particularly hot night when I decided not to wear pants. Or a blanket. Or a sheet. Only loose boxers. She left pretty quickly after coming in, which I remember thinking was weird until I look down and notice my boxers had ridden up and my balls were just...out there.
