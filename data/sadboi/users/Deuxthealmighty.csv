Mason lives in the crystal caves and likes to spend time worrying about anything and everything could kill him or hurt him and his to purge it. Better known as crippling anxiety. His sometimes have minds of there own and look like there trying to escape. Sometimes Madon feels lonely so that's why he made this profile on minionmatches.com to find some new (slaves) friends after all he put so much time into writing this and is definitely not forcing his slave to write this and is why it's in third person. Dispite all these quirks Mason is a good boss and hopes you will come and work (RUN NOW WHILE YOU FAMILY EXIST) for him. He even provides grooming for families (No he doesn't he just disintegrated them and puts them in the dust room). Mason is hoping to find some new minions. See you soon at the third cave to the left in the abandoned drawven mine"
