Those reasons are exactly why human form society and try to get away from nature in the first place. We recognize that the natural world is a vicious and cruel place and thus create society to distance ourselves from it. Now our own societal structures are failing and there are those who seek to return to that ""natural"" state."

I don't think we're ever free. Existence is a fractals of prisons. You think you're outside of the box when actually you're in another box.

&#x200B;

>why can't 7 billion people revolt and make existence less painful and more meaningful?

because 99% of them just don't have that degree of introspection. It is beyond their purview.

&#x200B;

>Money is our God/religion and controls our lives. No money=no access to resources unless you are a criminal of sorts.

Well it is certainly not mine. I understand the necessity but i most certainly will not chase it down. Oh, and money isn't the only way to have access to resource. The fruits on the tree and the water in the river are accessible in nature without money.

>I feel people think we are better than animals but we are not. We are just more sophisticated but hardly better.

better in what way? we certainly have the intellect but our body are inferior to almost all animals on this planet.

&#x200B;

>isn't it funny how certain things are socially frowned upon if ever you bring up those 'forbidden' topics? It is as if not to 'offend' people translates into 'you should not break the delusion of life or else no one would want to get up in the mornings.'

Most people's ego will protect itself whenever it feel that something is threatening its belief system.

&#x200B;

>It is a strange feeling but I do not want to be alive because I see no point in it. Not like I want to kill myself but really, what is the point of life? Sure, we all make it our own meaning. However, our problems and dreams are tiny compared to the universe man. Again, I wonder, how often people think about that? All I can say is, I do not want to live for long because I don't want to live long enough to see myself become dementia old. I am 25, still failed to launch and am tired of the grind. I mean, it's one thing to enjoy the hunt and it is another to realise that you are in a rat race.

i can relate

>After watching Westworld, it made me think a lot about how we create our own narrative loops. About how people keep coming back to the park to a) discover who they could be and b) indulge in their desires. Maybe that is an allegory to life.

yep it's very easy for people to fool themselves and get trap in delusions and self-fulfilling prophecy. Everyone get the same bags of flesh and bone body capable of being harm at any moment.

&#x200B;

>Also, isn't weird how ppl will stop at nothing to 'treat' someone who is depressed and anxious? I mean, personally, I feel that if someone feels like that that they are seeing life for what it is and they simply can't deal with the reality of it.

the arrogance of society to assume that if you don't fit the mold of what we do then there's something wrong with you. A happy person would be treated if depression was the norm.

&#x200B;

>Why is Saturday night dedicated to some ritual of going out and getting drunk, laid or what have you?

I know some ppl who do this everyday ðŸ˜‚

in all seriousness though i think it's just a way to cope with all the bullshit in life.

>My last question is: why then as humans, who are supposed to be driven to procreate, are able to question and even refrain from procreating? Is that added torture or simply an easier time accepting things?

Yea i do feel that our highly evolved brain and high degree of self awareness are forms of tortures from evolution. Isn't it amazing how we are the only creature on this planet to actually stop and consider these things when other animals just do it blindly? Perhaps we are the anomaly in evolution."
