AutismTranslated,fny3r1r,t3_g4kgz5,1587352683.0,"Hey there! For one, you are definitely not alone. Almost the exact same thing happened to me over the past year. I got diagnosed Bipolar when I was 17, but the more I'd gotten that under control, I'd started to find focusing, connecting with others, and coping with consistent full-time work much harder. I'm now 23 and basically moving my life in a completely different direction to try to be my most ""authentic"" self instead of the polite mask I morphed into most of my life. It's stressful and every day I wonder if I'm going to finally going get it together (for real, not faking it to survive)

It's super hard, but I've been doing more music lessons and worked on writing more and I still feel a little crazy for trying to find ""me"" so late when I thought something more formal is what I ""should"" do with my life. It's hard to figure out. I'm trying to lean more onto my support people lately and really show them who the real me is, not the person who I was because I thought that's what I should be. 

It's been far more awkward and embarrassing, but every day I'm pushing myself and liking me for me a tiny bit more
 I wish you best of luck and 100% if you want someone to talk to, my messages are open. It's a really weird and uncomfortable and stressful transition (especially with the state of the world). But you deserve to be you 💚"

 I myself was super depressed when I hit college and, as I was being a generally miserable person, I made out with a guy despite having a boyfriend back home. I broke up with the boyfriend the next time he visited and I've never been proud of it, but I understand how the increase in young depression might also increase the amount of dumb decisions made while you hate yourself.

But nope, these guys just suck. Yikes. Please make yourself some better friends with similar values to yours."
AutismTranslated,fa9drj5,t3_e7x6n3,1575869949.0,"I can answer this on multiple levels, because routines are super important to me wellbeing. Fair note, I do also have bipolar disorder and Anxiety so it's a little nuanced, but still.

On a macro level, I have moved every year for 8 years (finally settling down thank Jesus) and no matter how positive a move is, the change in routine from place to place really messed me up. One, having to reapply my plans to a different space/restrictions is super stressful. For example, I used to have a laundry unit that went off every hour. Now mine go off every 1.2 hours. So my old routine and brain have me getting up from work, checking the laundry, only for it not to be done, then going back to work and either forgetting the laundry for hours or not really focusing until it's time to move laundry.

Basically, gist is, the small changes in routine that come from big transitions feed into an unstable, exhaustive loop that really take me awhile to adjust to. 

On a micro level, my executive functioning is a mess. If I don't take some time in the morning to order my schedule that day, I have a decent shot of getting way too distracted to get work done. For example, maybe I'm thirsty. I go to the sink to get water, but then I notice some dishes I should really do. Then, I notice the mail came so I go do that, and it's a package so I open that and get excited and maybe worse, It's for Christmas so I bring it in and then check off things on my Christmas list before also thinking I should check on my mom for when she's visiting and oh boy one drink of water suddenly took over 30 minutes.

If I make myself a schedule, I know exactly what needs to be done and in what order. I even put simple stuff like ""do dishes"" and ""check mail""  or even ""text brother"" so that I know those thing have an order and place and am less likely to throw myself off course.

Also, breaking routine can just be super frustrating and help lead down self-doubt/moodiness spirals. It's just so much simpler to follow them and let's your overstimulated brain focus elsewhere. 

Even tonight for example, I stayed up later playing video games instead of getting ready for bed at 10 pm sharp. Then I did a lot of my nighttime routine out of order, I didn't calm myself down quite right, and now here I am hours later, wide awake.

There's probably more nuance to it but it's really late my time so my brain's a bit fuzzy. I'm just a writer, too, and knew I had to answer and help if I could. Best of luck writing!"
BipolarReddit,f9bbwni,t3_e4hrrm,1575211162.0,"Personally, I had a bad habit of keeping that truth from boyfriends until I hit a downswing or upswing and HAD to tell them what was going on with me.

It's up to your discretion, but IMO it's easier to explain your life and condition when it's not overrunning you. 

My current boyfriend is the only one I told the second he asked me to be his girlfriend, because I wanted to be in control of telling him, not my bipolar.

It seems to have worked so far (5 years together, just bought a house) but honestly it's really subjective so I'm not saying my ""hard and fast truth bombs"" way is right for everyone.

That's just how it works for me; on my worst days my dog and my writing and my boyfriend are the only things that get me out of bed. I think I'd (personally) be a lot worse off if I could just NOT do what I'm responsible for with them. 

However, I'm a very productivity based person so as said, very biased opinion.

BipolarReddit,f0k0fac,t1_f0jw2td,1568667279.0,"Well, in NAMI's case it's a mental health organization that runs group meetings around the country. Just look online and you can find a local one. If you're not in the US, you can look and see if your country has any other similar resources. It's for all mental disorders, but in general it could help to go to a meeting just for information and to see if hearing other similar people helps.

If you really don't want to meet in person, forums like here or r/bipolar or psych forums can help you feel like you have community and people who understand. Get involved, share jokes, experiences, etc.

I cope with bipolar disorder through writing. It helps get out all those racing thoughts and feelings. 

I also have talked a lot with my boyfriend about my experience. It's hard, being with someone who doesn't understand what your brain feels like. So the best answer is to tell him. It may feel awkward and overwhelming, but learning to communicate what's happening with you and your needs should help.

Do you have any local NAMI chapters or bipolar groups? You should look into it. Having people near you who understand can be helpful. Just casually getting to hear and chat about the inherently disordered parts of your life can make you normalize your brain and your life.

Your life will be different because of your disorder, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good life. You can be happy, just different 💚"
bipolar2,f0jtbti,t3_d4tavt,1568662555.0,"I have had quite the experience with guilt and forgiveness.

This sounds super cynical, but what helped me was realizing most people didn't care about how I hurt them, not after awhile. Sure, it meant they don't like me, but they moved on with their lives, grew past me. I didn't matter to them.

 it can alleviate that ""I make the world and everyone around me worse"" depressive/anxious lie. Because that brain lie is what makes that guilt incessant instead of having a more normal period of processing. 

Another point that might help, bipolar moods sometimes happen without specific things distressing you. Your brain doesn't like having bad feelings for no reason, though, so sometimes guilt (something that is easy for all people to hold onto) is easier to latch on as why you are feeling bad instead of ""mood dipped just cause"". 

Once I accepted both facts, my bad moods did better to accept they were no good reason, bad bipolar moods instead of trying to find reason and guilt out of my mental condition. 

Hope any of that might help you process."

If you are currently in that moment a severe danger to yourself, they will probably just keep you longer to make sure you wont be a danger to yourself. However, if it's severe enough in the moment, they might recommend hospitizaltion. But it's not like an  institution, that's the asylum esque BULLSHIT that movies love. Hospitilization is more like a 7-14 day intensive stay where you work with psychiatrists, work on a medical plan including medicine and the future, and go to group therapy. It does often include no phones, but it really depends on the facility. My BIL has done a a super no contact one and then also one where he only went there during the day, so it's far less traumatic and horrible than TV tells you, though I am biased by my own fine/helpful experiences from myself, family, and friends.

HOWEVER If you just tell a doctor you have been suicidal before and you are not currently, they will just help get you resources and working towards getting yourself better. Do not shy away from telling them if you have felt that way before, because it gives them an honest look into how severe your lows have been and how much you've been struggling with.

My parents were semi-absentee, so that was real lonely for me, but the plus side was I spent every moment in my life in a general ""figure out how to swim by yourself or you'll sink"" mentality.

So I have a lot of tools for helping yourself when you feel all alone in the world. If rough childhood means I get to help others put themselves first and swim, I think it's a fair trade.

Another good tip for that anxiety feeling in Dr. offices is blurting it out at the beginning, even before any typical ""chit chat"". It may feel out of place and impolite, but it's better to get out ""ok doc, we need to talk about my mood. Even if we stop for basics, please make me accountable"" before anxiety gears up while they say general hellos. 

Bonus, some online appointment systems will let you put in ""what are you in for today"" and there you could write ""I'm concerned about my mental health and have had thoughts of suicide"".

Other pre-diagnosis stuff that helped me (other than lurking on forums and writing down my symptoms) included:

Writing a vague script of what I wanted to say to my doctor, so my anxiety didn't make me wuss out

Asking for resources that help you get the care you need (either research on the internet or ask the doctor when you see them)

Downloading a mood tracker like Daylio or any others so I could start keeping an eye on where my moods are at/bring aware of what's happening to my emotions

Completely ignore what the media/movies/etc. say about mental illnesses. It's mostly bullshit. They will only make you panic and feel ashamed when you are just a person with a disorder like anyone with diabetes or something would be  Trust mental health resources and communities of people who GET IT and let them be honest and accepting of you

Key in a very close, open-minded, trusted loved one or two into what you're dealing with so that you have some support (you don't have to tell them EVERYTHING, but even saying ""I'm going through some mental health stuff and would appreciate you being available to support me"" is good)

Also, please do not just try to medicate with alcohol. Alcohol is a downer, and despite the buzz it gives, it could put your already seemingly irregular mood shifts further out of whack. Alcohol is a recreational drink, not a medicine.

bipolar,eztin0b,t1_ezp82gu,1568131209.0,"Hey guy! I'm on methylphenidate and have been on various dosage rules for it for about a year now. It seems to work pretty well for me. So I can't tell you much about strattera, but I will say I haven't had any weird side effects. 

However, I do think I remember my psych at the time saying they are sometimes wary of giving it to people because its easy to start abusing it for weight loss reasons. So if that's a risk, I wouldn't recommend. In my case, any ADD meds I've taken have required some playing around with. When I worked at a restuarant, I needed to take it half an hour before going to work or I would get overwhelmed. At first I also took a dose before bed, but I was on shorter acting versions. 

Now, I take what is a daily dose (20 mg) and it seems to help a lot. Does take some time to adjust back on, though. I'm still a little jolty today because I had to take a few days off for dumb reasons, even though I took my dose this morning. 

Personally, my brain gives me enough trouble to always feel like trying new meds that could help are worth the trade-off. But I did switch off Abilify because of the weight gain and dulling effect it had on me back in the day. So it's subjective, its your choice if a med isn't worth it, but I advocate for at least trying.

There's a big shame culture about mental illness, no matter how inclusive the internet may act. And I've found in past generations, that turns into HARDCORE internalized stigma, akin to internalized homophobia or racism.

My dad has severe depression and anxiety. He self medicates with alcohol and Xanax, but refuses to see a doctor for any more official help.

When I ""came out"" as bipolar, begging for help about feeling miserable and wanting to die, he reacted terribly. He blamed me, said I should be able to suck it up like everyone else, yelled at me while I was figuring out my meds and crying a lot, etc.

Even if it doesn't make complete sense (like your mom taking anti-depressants herself) she probably has this internalized hatred for her own illness and feels like anyone in pain needs to bear it silently. With insisting on therapy, diagnoses, and having some attempts, she probably sees you as a ""loud"" sick person doing it wrong by telling other people.

Now, mind you, she's wrong and being toxic and awful. Get care and get better whatever way suits you. She's a crumpled testicle for treating you otherwise.

crazyexgirlfriend,evxr471,t1_evxg19x,1564903650.0,"I get that. It's fair. Since it's been brought up here in this thread I've been trying to grapple with the concept in a more fictional storytelling way than in real life.

I think with the ""taking responsibility and going to jail"" arc was supposed to cover Rebecca's proverbial facing up to her actions and getting true ramications for them without getting rid of her friends, but it is questionably effective.

The core of the issue seems to be that it's a semi-surrealistic comedy so it's hard to bridge the gap between the rules of Rebecca's mentally disordered life and the real lives people experience. Similarly to all her friends forgiving her, it's also super unrealistic that she'd HAPPEN to make a best friend with absurd hacking skills to blow her impulses and manipulative plans out of proportion. Most her actions are nowhere close to the reality of mental illness. Wild shit can go down, sure, but not THAT much.

But since it is about such a real, raw issue that isn't talked about nearly enough, of course there will be dissasfaction with how it handled things. Not to give CEG a pass, everything deserves criticism and honest analysis, but it would probably feel less egregious if there was more media to compare it to. When almost the only comedies dealing with mental disorders are Bojack and CEG, of course there's going to be this huge, bizarre disconnect. Maybe the true answer is we just need even more shows to give fans who care about mental illness inclusivity a better breadth on the reality of the illnesses, because honestly no single show could ever cover everything effectively."
crazyexgirlfriend,evwo12y,t1_evv9kne,1564869011.0,"I totally get it. I think just as someone who gets really fatalistic sometimes about my disorder meaning all my relationships will fuck up, I do like seeing a show that assumes that they won't.

But the creators have joked (though I have no memory where I remember reading this, so take it with a grain of salt) that the show is set in an alternate, more inclusive reality since it's cast is such a diverse blend of people. 

I get why people don't like it because it can feel less realistic. I can't watch Bojack because it gets so dark and leads me really, really dark places.  I hate bland happily ever after, but my favorite is complicated wistful or hopeful. That level of rawness cuts a little too deep sometimes and I don't want that to be everyone's reality with mental illness forever, even if it is now."
crazyexgirlfriend,evurec8,t3_cl9bmn,1564803772.0,"I think an interesting thing to think about here is the intended audience/message of the show

While it attracts a lot of disordered folk because of the subject matter, the way the show is framed is largely towards general folk who only have light understanding of depression/disorders. Note Rebecca doesn't even get a diagnosis until season 3. It's to draw fans into this likable but wholly flawed character who logically expresses over time that she has a serious mental illness but that she can be okay and a good friend.

I think that aspect of her friends always forgiving her has less to do with Rebecca and people with mental disorders and instead the nuerotypicals that can be watching. After all, it's a lens through which they can see how forgiveness towards friends with disorders can still lead to fulfilling, loving relationships. I think it's why the ""I can't promise I will always be well"" scene with Rebecca and Valencia was important to the show. People without disorders can see they're not in the wrong or bring dumb for forgiving and loving people with mental disorders, which a fair amount of people do because of the stigma.

I 100% believe Rebecca would have wholly desrved anyone giving up on their relationship with her, but as a work of fiction can give struggling disordered people hope that not everyone will leave them and make non-disordered folks feel more comfortable trusting and loving them.

The opinion is subjective, but I think it's an interesting and neat way to look at it.

In college, my first roommate and I got along great. She was nerdy and liked science and we both were good little weirdo buddies. She even became quick friends with my friends from high school.

I started college on one hell of a manic high, going from September to about early October. Then I dipped, hard, and missed some classes and was struggling dealing with the hookups and burnt bridges left in the wake of my mania.

While my relationship with her was still good, I thought it only fair I tell her what's up. The conversation seemed to go fine and it was nice to have it out in the open.
 
Overnight her attitude towards me changed, though. My self contained messiness was now intolerable disaster. My hookups were now dumb and irresponsible. Me missing classes was now a waste of my life. She would text me about how she thought my laundry smelled, even though I did it weekly, and about how the paper stack I had on my desk was unbearable. 

She said I had to fix it or she was moving. 

I was too stunned to compute. We had been roommates for over a month now, and suddenly some small messy habits were enough to hate me? 

I realized it all changed when I told her about my disorder. It was like every flaw about me was now dangerously intolerable. 

She moved out a few weeks later, on my birthday. I cried a lot about it. She also took my high school friends with her. They never spoke to me again and I still don't understand what I did. 

Nuerotypicals can be fine roommates, my boyfriend and some later college roomies we're, but I don't think I'll ever trust strangers again to live with me. That was an unpredicted hell I don't want to repeat."
BipolarReddit,evrpwh0,t1_evq4ltk,1564714984.0,"While I agree with you, am 100% team only you can fix you, I do think they responded really poorly to a lot of active warning signs

However, that might more be based on the shitty way society teaches the average person to deal with mental health, not the friends 

Either way, I guess I mostly just don't want OP to feel like she's entirely to blame for being ignored. Less to do with your comment in particular, really, and more just want her to feel like she's not a sadball deserving of being ignored because it's really all her fault cause that's not right, but that's how depressed brain can be

But also I just downswung myself a bit today so sorry anyone if I'm projecting. Situation sucks regardless and I hope you get help, OP 💚"
BipolarReddit,euyykqb,t1_euywo4c,1564110414.0,"Don't mean to hijack this, but I Initially expected myself to be annoyed but I wasn't. I felt this comment. I just dealt with sorting out why I get so irritated by manifestation theorists telling me my positive vibes or bad vibes will attract each kind of events to my life, respectively. And I kinda came to this same conclusion, that I need to see the world in the most realistic, level way possible or I'd drive myself crazier.

I hard believe in this world being a giant chaos ball and any really good or really bad shit can be random, but I also can do my best to make day to day life okay and make the bad days bearable or good days less uncontrollable. Kind of a ""I can effect myself, but some days stupid chaos and my disorder will win and that's okay, we'll get em next time, boys"".

Anyway, I appreciate someone else finding worth in realism and leveling. I think it can be really important for people with bipolar disorder."

BipolarReddit,et65reo,t3_ca507q,1562504609.0,"Ok, I have serious body dysmorphia so my weight/body problems come from different places a little, and I know you said with your disorder you have to all or nothing it, but I think getting to that ""all"" slowly might help.

My biggest weight loss victory was during college. I got blood clots in my lungs so couldn't exercise and gained 50 pounds in 6 months. 

I started with sweets. I have a terrible sweet tooth, so I gave myself two dessert ""tokens"" in my head for the week. Most of the time I just saved them up for a nice weekend, but it really cut down on that. I felt like I was ""spending"" calories I earned but also still enjoying goods I loved.

Next wasn't exercise, but finding any time that I could afford to walk instead of riding the bus. I went hardcore and walked about 2 hours a day, but even just taking a half hour more walking can help to just get your body moving (obviously after your poor ankle heals).

Then I did fun exercise when I could, just made sure I had a vegetable course on my plate and only used one size plate to keep my portions in check, and went forward with that.

I know it won't be the same for you, but taking it baby steps might help you adjust to a more exercise filled schedule and feel free to tailor your plan to your vices. For example, I don't drink coffee, but if your a fancy drink addict from Starbucks, try to decrease to 3 drinks a week, not one daily. That kinda stuff.

I wish you the best of luck. I'm still on my own body journey too and you deserve to be happy with yourself."
books,esz4nyf,t3_c9gm6d,1562355106.0,"I agree, I don't like Paul. But I think, personally, that makes me like Dune more. I like enjoying the complex, intelligent politicians and people around him desperate to make long-form plans they invest so much in with no certainty they'll ever win, but they do it anyway because they believe in themselves.

But Paul ruins all of that by knowing everything.

There's something oddly satisfying (to me) to basically have the Bran/Rob hybrid of Dune deal with his superpowered birthright, become it, and utterly hate it. He's not heroic or righteous. He just hates it but keeps on trucking because he knows it must be done. It's super fuckity and strange and it's a very unique protagonist in sci-fi. Most chosen ones are self righteous and proud and assume they're always right. They make themselves the good guy.

Paul just kinda does what he has to, getting everything precisely done in a particularly unexcited and mundane fashion. 

I totally get why you wouldn't like him, but compared to other average Joe chosen ones meant to be a person's vicarious vessell, I do enjoy him the most. Not as a person, but as a concept."
bipolar,esqlco9,t1_esqc91p,1562204808.0,"Wow, but it's almost like there is little to no positive depiction of bipolar disorder, making finding it in media really cringey. 

I don't mind murder-y folk if there's also equal amounts having perfectly normal lives. But there aren't. It's like if you only made movies about black people as villainous criminals just because there is a high population of them in jails.

Sure, some are just bad people or okay ones led to lives of crime. But there are tons of other folks in that community that are just normal people living their lives that seem to barely exist in cinema. That's kinda gross."
relationships,esn7zg9,t3_c8iqti,1562124923.0,"Only commenting because the others so far have been pretty negative.

My boyfriend is a logical, pragmatic code monkey to a fault. I am an extremely empathetic writer who gets overwhelmed by others and emotions a lot. The core of the issue isn't your differences, it's finding communication and love in them.

Sure, for some people it's an incompatibility. But in our case, other emotional people tend to drain me after awhile, and other pragmatic people can bore him. He chooses to see my emotional side as exciting passion and creativity and kindness, not flighty and out of control (though it definitely can be). And I see his logic as a grounding force in my life, and a solid guidestone that I can always rely on. Even though, similarly, I could see him as rigid or controlling or less loving (which, to be fair, he can be).

If the person's worth it, try to work together to shift your own perspectives. See how his planning is thoughtful, not clinical. Ask him to think of your tears of joy as expression and love, not overdramatic. 

One thing other people have right, this kind of temperament is important to who a person is. Don't ask anyone to try to change. But maybe looking at each other differently can help.

But if you can't, that's also okay and just means you guys are probably better off with other people of other temperaments. 

Best of luck :)"

BipolarReddit,esg5mnt,t1_esg0qat,1561943787.0,"Or also telling yourself the only reason you're not achieving anything and all the things you've tried aren't working is because you're the problem can kill you.

Some people can manage this whole Gambit. Others can't. Some can at some points in their lives and can't at others. Most everyone is a spectrum.

One of the most life-saving things I've ever done is accept that my disorder is my brain's chemistry, and because it's so finecky, my journey never will be exactly like anyone elses, even other bipolar people. For example, since getting medicated, sun makes me sick as fuck. I have found great peace in working in a basement with no windows. But it's on this list, right? And I have a pretty good relationship and understanding with my mania, but depression is pretty rocky and always takes awhile for me to catch because I'm a writer and being in my head a lot is my literal job. Not all things can fit the list well.

Telling myself I'm self-defeatist mess if I cannot do these things sometimes would help kill me. Accepting some days I need to be at peace with where I'm at is much better. 


It's easy to tell people who are in a worse place that they aren't trying hard enough. It's easy to blame them and feel superior for doing good by yourself. 

It's great one person is doing well and doing things ""right"". But it's also great that someone else is still surviving even when their brain fights them like hell.

But don't tell others how to cope with their disorder. Some are motivational positivity folk, some deal with black humor, some cope by floating in surviving. Trying to push your ideals and your health capabilities on others is bullshit."
sex,esegjyq,t1_eseb06n,1561897992.0,"This is more to jump in as an English nerd to (I think) clear up some miscommunications.

The first commenter used courteous, which is an adjective used to say someone is polite and considerate. Calling someone courteous is akin to calling them thoughtful, which is fine.

Using the noun courtesy, though, does have different meaning, because doing things ""out of courtesy"" or ""giving her a courtesy"" is implied more as a polite favor. Different meaning with a bit more ""I'm a good person because I do this"" flair to it.

I get being upset if anyone did say he was doing this as a courtesy to her. That's dumb. But saying he's being courteous is just complimenting his own thoughtfulness.

But honestly this kinda shit happens because words can look the same/similar and mean different things or have different implications because our language is kinda borked. Hecking English. I appreciate everyone defending her though, that's good human 101 👍"
relationships,errqbdx,t1_erngndq,1561179136.0,"Honestly, you're right and I appreciate you saying it. My parents didn't change when I was a 13 year old girl with cuts on her arms begging to get help. They've still managed to make my illnesses about them and completely cut themselves off as support systems for me. They've made miniscule improvement, but I think it was out of fear of me cutting them out. And even then, it's clear to me now the improvement only was them hiding away their bad behavior so I couldn't get upset and frustrated with them about it.

Growing up in therapy, I live in a constant betterment mindset so it drives me bonkers not to be able to really do anything about the whole situation, not without making things worse for my brother or creating painful situations that don't solve anything. 

I'm working on figuring out how to act normal after this, but my brother's health and sanity is the priority. I'll just focus on that.
