He continuously didn't want to do anything but lie around his room, stating he's trying to save money. That's fine; I'm not high maintenance. I don't need fancy meals or the theater. I would have been happy just getting out of the house and enjoying nature or to the mall to just look at things.

I felt completely trapped.

Eventually, he had a big blowup about how ""shit"" his life was because a friend of his said one thing negative about him. I realized then and there that if I stayed with him, it would only cause me to become dissociate and uninterested in everything. I would be a shell of a human, only staying with him because I didn't want to do the hard thing. I broke it off that day."

You will still see results eventually when you go down in sizes; however, muscle does make your weight stagnate. It happened to me when I went to the gym a few months into weight loss. 

I would say since you aren't going to the gym because of them all being closed, focus on your diet. Go from 1800 calories down to 1700 then 1600 then 1500 gradually. If you are able to do cardio stuff like running or riding a bike, try that as well. 

But I'll be honest, when I started to stagnate after four months of going to the gym 5 days a week, I just stopped going and really dug into lowering calorie intake. Every week or two, I would take off 100 calories so that it didn't seem like too much taken away."
