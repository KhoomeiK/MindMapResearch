Bone marrow collection products are referred to as HPC, marrow (HPC-M). Cord blood products are referred to as HPC, cord blood (HPC-CB). Transplants with any of these products are considered HSCTs."

lupus,fi7s99q,t1_fi6uf6v,1582227227.0,"Hello fellow clinical lab worker! Glad you aren't experiencing any symptoms of active CMV infection.

The presence of CMV specific T cells simply means you have been infected with CMV at some point in time. This paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00430-019-00608-7 suggests that these T cells will increase over time. That's actually a good thing. It means your immune system is keeping the virus in check and working correctly. 

These T cells are currently being used therapeutically in immunocompromised patients post allogeneic bone marrow transplant to fight CMV infection. It's pretty cool. 

I know not worrying is easier said than done, but since lupus gets worse with stress, our management of it is essential."
lupus,fi5g81h,t1_fi548bm,1582162430.0,"Do you have any symptoms of a CMV infection? About 60% of the population is infected with CMV. Usually there are primary symptoms and then it becomes latent, reactivating when the immune system is very compromised, like in cancer patients with completely destroyed immune systems post myeloablative therapy. These symptoms include fever, compromised blood cell production, and a lot of other very noticeable symptoms.

Lupus can cause false positive results for many different tests, especially antibody testing. I have a background in the clinical laboratory, and we were taught early on that lupus can screw up basically every test you can imagine. The other thing drilled into us is ""one test does not make a diagnosis."" All tests must be viewed compared to other laboratory results and the entire clinical picture.

You do not have CMV DNA in your blood or evidence in your organs, so it would not suggest an active infection. Was your CMV IgG tested? Regardless, if you aren't symptomatic for CMV I would not worry about it. If your immune system becomes compromised due to your lupus treatment and the CMV reactivates, you'll be treated with antivirals. They can also monitor your CMV DNA levels in your blood over the treatment time to see if the antivirals are working. CMV currently is not curable but antivirals can keep the virus in check when it reactivates. Your physician has weighed the risk and benefits of suppressing your immune system to treat your lupus vs. viral reactivation. Your immune system will continually and actively destroy your body if you are not on immunosuppressants.

TLDR: If you do not have symptoms of a CMV infection, and no CMV DNA in your blood, you are probably not having an active CMV infection. If you have symptoms of an active CMV infection, it can be treated with antivirals. Helpful link: https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cytomegalovirus-cmv-tests"

SkincareAddiction,feincht,t3_ep7qa8,1579142562.0,"I would suggest a gentle SA cleanser, a retinoid serum, and a very gentle light moisturizer (depending on how humid it is/how your skin responds). Exfoliate chemically or physically no more than once a week, and if you use masks, use them once or twice a week and spread out from the exfoliation. Be mindful of keeping shampoo and conditioner away/off your face and wash your pillowcases frequently. Pay close attention to everything that touches your face and how your face responds.

I used to struggle with the same thing and it drove me nuts! Then I was diagnosed with rosacea and became very gentle with my face. My complexion improved and the bumps went away. I suggest staying away from temperature extremes (hot cloth included) and avoid rubbing or physically exfoliating your face - treat it like you would a babies face. A gentle moisturizer can go a long way too in decreasing sebum overproduction. Best of luck!"

The nicer neighborhoods I've found are the ones that don't want commitment - a large part of the city is made up of working class mainly Hispanic families. We are also surrounded by rural towns that marry young and settle down early.

There's a growing group of single people (mainly implants from Cali and the NE) but San Antonio has always been family oriented and family friendly. Way better chance to find someone to settle down with here than Austin, for example. We definitely do love eating, drinking, and partying, but with family.

dating_advice,fcsw2d2,t1_fcss1wv,1577926568.0,"There's a huge space between spending 24/7 with someone and being closer to someone than other people. Most relationships fall in between. It sounds like you do want a relationship but have convinced yourself otherwise because he doesn't want one. 

What you're describing (texting every day, good morning good night etc) can even just be a close friendship, depending on the people involved. Others may find that much interaction exhausting. In the same vein, some couples are glued to each other. Other couples spend plenty of time apart. It really depends on the people involved and what they want.

Sit down and really figure out what you want. Then approach the guy and communicate this to him. Be honest with yourself and be willing to walk away if he can't give you what you need/want or isn't on the same page."
