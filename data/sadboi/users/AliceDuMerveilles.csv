TrueOffMyChest,fijbaqd,t1_fij8xvy,1582440644.0,"So if the submissive is crying and screaming no, stop, please you're hurting me, but not safe wording, what would you call this?

 Many rape survivors, including myself, find it freeing to re-experience a scripted, negotiated rape fantasy to help them process what has been done to them in the past. No, it's not rape. It's consentual non-consent, or con non con for short. People who are active in the lifestyle call it this, not rape fantasy 90% of the time. Unfortunately you get a lot of people on the internet who haven't done a lot of research and will say inappropriate things like ""rape fantasy.""

When done following RACK (risk aware cobsentual kink) and proper negotiations, you can minimize the risk to both the psyche and the submissive, and the dominant but setting boundries. No one is running out on the street asking people to rape them, and if they are they're naive at best.

Also, the safest way to ""choke"" someone is to put pressure on the blood vessels on the sides of the throat. You're not actually pressing on the windpipe, which can break it. But it feels the same to the submissive. It's more of a gripping motion than what people assume it is."

I can't speak to denial, but I had to stop working about 5 months ago now. My pain and psychiatric state had gotten way out of hand. If you have a child, most states offer TANF for the time between stopping work and receiving disability.

For me it was an option because it's just me. I go to a bunch of doctors now, trying different drugs, going to intensive outpatient therapy for my PTSD and agorophobia. It's been really hard, but I see the path to it getting easier. Just this week I've accepted that my life will never be the same as before I got sick. I'm trying to learn how to adapt.

Good luck on your journey."

It's made my communication a lot easier, too. It's mainly group therapy, and you get an individual counselor to dig check ins with. The one I go to is 3 groups a day, and I go 3 days a week but I'm probably bumping it up to 4 or 5. Mine is medicaid/Medicare only.
