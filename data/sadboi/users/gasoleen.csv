My husband and I are usually strictly moderate in our intake, because in the past we were in a situation similar to the lockdown where we had moved 2000 miles away from friends and family to a place where there was nothing to do and I worked a job I hated with a terrible commute and my husband couldn't find a job and was isolated all day, and we were knocking back large amounts of booze every night.

Two weeks later (5 weeks in) I was ready to say ""screw it, let's have free drinking again"" because that was when the depression set in.  We went 2 more weeks of having a couple drinks a night before I was over it, and we've since gone back to moderation.

Me and two friends just went backpacking in the mountains overnight Fri-Sat.  All of us are anti-lockdown.  The mountains were ""crowded"" this weekend (in that we saw more people than usual; I'm not saying the trails were Congo-lines).  It was an interesting mix of people.  We saw:

1.  Those who genuinely did not give two fuxx anymore.  These people came in all ages, shapes and colors.  They weren't wearing masks while hiking, and they were friendly and observed trail etiquette (e.g. move aside for those ascending).  There were many families out with their children, and people who were either extended families or friends.  We met an elderly couple who found out we were doing dispersed camping and got excited because they realized it was a loophole for the ""no camping in established sites"" rule.  

2.  The ""judgy"" mask-wearers.  These were mostly women in their 40s.  That whole ""Karen"" stereotype has to have some basis, somewhere....  These are the ones who make a big show of glaring at you when they pass you, adjusting their masks to emphasize that they're wearing them.  These people also don't observe trail etiquette.  They expect you to move off-trail for *them*, regardless of who's ascending.

3.  The chill mask-wearers.  These were mostly people in their 20s and 30s.  They didn't care that half the hikers weren't wearing masks.  They were friendly and chatting with people they encountered.  I think they were wearing the masks more to try and ""be good"" than out of fear.

4.  The insanely fearful mask-wearers.  These people, even when hiking in groups that could not possibly all be living together, were silent and highly avoidant of other hikers, going so far as to step 10ft off trail.  And there was one solo hiker who sticks out most in my mind, because she was *terrified*.  She was already standing on the edge of a narrow trail, with a steep drop-off on one side and a cliff wall on the other.  She saw me coming and freaked out, shouting, ""Wait let me get off trail!!"" and yanking her mask on.  She was stepping onto unstable ground, at the edge.  I called to her, ""Don't; you could fall!""  She only responded hysterically, ""LET ME GET OUT OF THE WAY!""  She stepped into a bush that was clinging to the cliffside and I honestly worried she'd go over.  She clutched at it to keep balance as we passed.

> A few weeks back, I stumbled across the tin foil hattery of a “filmyourhospital” hashtag on Twitter—the craziest conspiracy theorists positing hospitals were empty.

My thoughts on this, based on friends I have who work in medical fields....  The COVID-19 wards are occupied but not overrun, and even then they are only full in large, densely populated cities like LA.  The triage centers for these hospitals, though, sit empty or near-empty.  The non-COVID wards up until this point have definitely been empty or near-empty, because elective surgeries were all canceled.  My friend is a surgical tech at a major hospital with a near-full COVID ward.  She works trauma, and she has only helped perform intubation on 2 COVID patients this whole time.  She has adequate PPE and isn't being overworked, and neither is anyone she works with.  She said there are nurses driving around her hospital, though, honking because they're demanding better PPE, and she's confused by this because she feels those still working at her hospital *do* have good PPE.  I have another friend, who's been called in as an ER doc in a small mountain tourist town, and while their COVID-19 ICU isn't full she recently intubated 12 patients and is implying the situation is real bad.  (Apparently the small mountain town hospitals aren't used to seeing this many ICU patients, even though they have the bed space.)  To listen to her, you'd think this was the apocalypse, which is a very different story from my friend in the city.

> Or is it the lack of testing is already leading to a dramatic undercount?

Testing is never going to catch up in the US, because we failed containment.  It's more practical to go by a) serological testing (antibody presence) and b) hospitalization rates and confirmed death counts.  And remember, under-testing also means *we are not getting accurate counts of those who have had it and recovered*.  Which is likely very high considering the current ballpark for percentage of asymptomatic/low-symptomatic cases is around 20-30%.  Again, *go to r/COVID-19 to look at the emerging data*.  It's not my responsibility to hand-gather the results of every study for you.

I have no way of knowing exactly what is going on in every state; they are vastly different in their approaches and case-loads.  And even if it was occurring, you can't extrapolate this behavior out to all states.  For all we know, pro-lockdown states could be *over* counting.
