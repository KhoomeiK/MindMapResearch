Ive been on maternaty leave and now its about time i start working again, but i don't see how I will manage that at all. 
How does people manage to raise Children, be a good wife, have a clean home, work all week, have hobbys, do fun things with the kids, spend time with friends and still have the energy to live? I can hardly keep the house in order and the family and pets happy, I dont even have energy left to brush my teeth!

But im confused, so it would have been ok if it was a sister or anybody else that she loves, but not when its someone not that close? 
In this situation I see how this cousin is just jelous and wants to be a bitch and steal the thunder, and 6months? That says it all, i would be ashamed. But if it was a blood cousin that she didnt disslike, then it would have been ok?"

I look forward to having another baby, thats the only thing! The thought of that makes me exited, it makes me look forward to the future and makes me wanna fight for it! 

The problem is that Ive had 2 misscarriges last year, which ofcourse made me feel worse during that time, but I still hade hope for our next try. 
But now, because of that, my husband feels that its not the right time anymore, he wants me to feel better FIRST and THEN we can discuss another baby. Which ofcorse have really fucked up my emotions even more, and have made me feel even worse! 
Im lost and hopleless. It was OUR plan, not just mine and now its gone and I don't know when I will get it back, or if I ever will..  
 I see his point of view, I really do, but I cant change my own because it feels like Im trapt in a catch 22 and I don't know how to get out of it.
