Minecraft,fqmeabb,t1_fqmd864,1589476015.0,"I know how to take a screenshot. It's simpler to just take a photo of the screen rather than go through a tedious process just to post on Reddit. I'm sorry if this bothers you, but at the end of the day it really doesn't inconvenience you in the slightest and should not have any impact on you. I do not want to set up an app on my phone that will take a while to do, just so that you can have a better quality picture of something that you would have never seen had I not posted it in the first place. So please, stop getting mad over such tiny things otherwise you will spend your life as a very angry and irritating person."

You don't deserve to have kids if you can't treat them both equally. Sure, maybe your son is not as clever or ambitious as your daughter, but that is no reason for him to be pushed aside. You are DEFINITELY ruining his future. I generally don't say this but in this situation... You are a terrible person and your son deserves much better."
