bodyweightfitness,fppjf5u,t3_ger70f,1588803384.0,"Maybe lower your daily calorie intake to 2,600 as 3,000 is a lot and you might be eating junk food to try hit those numbers. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and went from 150lb to 164lb on 2,600 cal/day.

Another good idea is to take progress pics every week or so. You might not see the results because you look at yourself everyday but bring up a comparison picture and it becomes clearer how far you‚Äôve progressed.

Lastly, it might be a good idea to add sports or exercises with explosive movements to your routine like jumping rope.

All this is based on personal experience so I cannot guarantee it will work for you, but it did for me and I hope it helps."
