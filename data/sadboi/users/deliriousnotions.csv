adhd_anxiety,fiqnx98,t3_f92dg2,1582648313.0,"The same thing happened to me when I started on Zoloft which is also an SSRI. I actually ended up going to the hospital because my heart rate was consistently around 120. They said that an SSRI shouldnâ€™t enhance side effects of the Adderall but it still got a lot better when I went off the Zoloft. Just do your best not to think about your heart rate all the time like I did. The anxiety of it all made everything worse physically and emotionally. Personally, when I tried Lexapro, it made me super hyper but I wasnâ€™t on Adderall then. Hope youâ€™re doing better."
penpals,fi3essv,t1_fi36r8y,1582114511.0,It definitely has some gore but itâ€™s worth it.

namenerds,fi1p3mx,t1_fi1o9za,1582062027.0,Actually he does kinda respond to Parker. I think he likes it lol.
namenerds,fi1lcp4,t1_fi1k9ud,1582059985.0,His current name is Roscoe but he hardly ever responds to it. Whenever I call him that he gets super hesitant to my touch and he starts looking a little frightened.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fh6t9es,t3_f1cax4,1581305526.0,This is my favorite thing.
penpals,fg6h6wt,t1_fg5n3gw,1580567866.0,I used to run track. Now I just do my own thing. Iâ€™ve never tried XC but it sounds like a hell of a time. Iâ€™m definitely up for email. Pm me!!

penpals,fg4lg0u,t1_fg4l5wi,1580505724.0,Awesome!! Iâ€™d be tempted to put that one in a frame and hang it. I did that with a periodic table puzzle one time and I often regret it lol
penpals,fg4l31j,t1_fg4k3cy,1580505505.0,Sometimes I do the big ones on the floor. I just play the floor is lava until I finish it lol. What picture was the 3000?
penpals,fg4gvwb,t1_fg4g60t,1580503106.0,Anything I can get my hands on tbh. Iâ€™m just started a 500 piece but I finished a 5000 piece last week. 18000 is crazy. Iâ€™d love to try one that big.

fashionporn,ffqiem8,t1_ffqggsf,1580135461.0,"I donâ€™t know much about D&G tbh ( Iâ€™m more of a McQueen fan) but I found this quote about the line: â€œThe collection paid homage to the Sicilian Island, which is also Domenicoâ€™s hometown. â€˜ It's a collection dedicated to Palermo. And the event has been organized as way to get to know Sicily and Italy"". Youâ€™re right though, itâ€™s not very subtle lol."
fashionporn,ffmr8i6,t3_eu3py8,1580058072.0,Love the texture that comes with designs like this one

And trust me I know that lol thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m researching and looking for opinions. Iâ€™ll wait if itâ€™s the best option, but I want to consider all of them."

Anxiety,fee7157,t3_eojtrm,1579027717.0,"I used to struggle with this in real life. Still do on occasion. I was afraid to do/say anything because I didnâ€™t want to be judged. What I didnâ€™t realize is that no one was paying attention to me.  Literally, nobody gave a single shit if I tripped over my own two feet. And even if they do notice, people never pay attention to anything very long. The worst thing that can happen is you missing out on life and others missing out on your amazing self."
Anxiety,fedc2zx,t1_febzyfg,1579007195.0,Yeah Iâ€™m hearing a lot of people with a similar experience and itâ€™s really encouraging. Definitely a fashion design major. Itâ€™s my passion.

Showerthoughts,fdqxo40,t1_fdqv7e2,1578676283.0,Not necessarily. Kids check under their beds at night for fantasy creatures. When Iâ€™m on my night runs Iâ€™m always checking dark corners and avoiding low-lit streets.
