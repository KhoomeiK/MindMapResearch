Hilary was not my first choice and the youthful people of this country are pissed at the DNC (as they should be) but politics needs to be pragmatic at times. There is no way someone can convince me that we would be in the mess we're in if a Dem was in office right now or if the Dems had control of The House and Senate. Do yourself a favor and come up with 5 of your most definitive policies that allign with your values, check and see who voted along those lines and vote for them. If nobody is voting in this line - then see if any are voting against your valued policies and vote to get them out of office.

Not sure which state you are from, but please stop disparaging education with a ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" mentality. You might have had a bad experience with education, but this does not mean it is the same for all. I feel the opposite is true of your statement and that a good education is the only thing keeping young people from making bad decisions. The mentality being perpetrated by your comments makes young people think of educators as the enemy or barrier to a better life when the opposite holds true. Teachers (most at least) are commissioned to help make society a better place. You're anger and animosity is well founded, just aimed in the wrong direction. Aim up - not down or side ways. It's not your fellow neighbor that is trying to keep you down. It is the people in charge. If you think educators on the front lines are the ones disabling your choice for a better life. . .
