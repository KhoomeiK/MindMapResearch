Here’s an excerpt from [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-wireless) 

>""Xbox Wireless"" is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft for connecting accessories to Xbox One consoles. Like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct, Xbox Wireless enables controllers and select headsets to establish a direct wireless connection with the console, while avoiding the complexities that come with adapters or physical cabling.

The article later states,

> Utilizing a **higher frequency connection than traditional 2.4 GHz Bluetooth**, on paper, Xbox Wireless promises a higher bandwidth connection for accessories. This, in turn, reduces latency, which can shave off vital milliseconds in competitive titles. The effects of this are mostly undetectable but should guarantee a stable connection for hardcore players.

There’s also people who’ve tinkered with the adapter and well yeah, it uses [5Ghz](https://gist.github.com/devkid/4b3bd50760504d1b93ea684cfd3ed895)"
