I love baking and cooking too and my anxiety sparks when I'm cooking since my family won't let me cook without letting me feel like I'm doing everything wrong while cooking. So I end up not eating anything I make.
It gets way better when I'm on uni since I get anxious only at class and then when I go to lunch I'm fine and have a way healthier diet and eating times.
