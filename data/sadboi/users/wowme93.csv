IncelExit,flc35mv,t1_flbf482,1585018720.0,"I understand your struggle. I, too, at some point in life felt jealous and angry at my crush for hooking up with another guy. There are 2 things i'd personally recommend u to do. 1) Manage your expectation: i was unhappy for awhile, probably a year or so since my crush told me she just wanted to be friend. I asked myself why was i so upset it's not like she was my gf we didnt have a commitment. Turned out i realized i wanted to be different. I was upset because my life was going nowhere, i didnt know what i would do after graduation, i was playing video game all the time and i was angry at myself and projected all of that onto the girl i liked. I expected her to be the source of solving all of my problems. The best way u could start looking into this is finding a therapist. 2) self-improvement: this one is way more difficult. Wake up early every morning, work a shit ton and limit any nonproductive behavior. You need to seriously ask yourself why should u go through with it, for me it was because i wanted to change myself and be a generally better person. If u accomplished just one of the 2 points then the way u see things will be completely different. It doesnt matter if your parents circumcised u, u could get your dick cut off and still feel like vladimir putin. Girls will surround you all the time because you are the source for them to confine in. Dont expect to have sex with them, expect to have conversations and be smooth. Read more books.
