God, just cause your a mom doesn't mean you are confined to a bed. If you know the kids are gonna be gone, then why not. It isn't your fault their dad doesn't respect time commitments and knows that you're a grown ass woman who is clearly gonna have sex. Don't let him shame you. And talk to your kids about it. Obviously that was horrifying for them, but sex is normal and there is nothing wrong with you having a life. They'll get over it. My mom was a big ho while I was growing up and used to lock herself in the bedroom with her new husband to suck dick while I watched 3 kids. Disturbing, yes. But I grew up to have a pretty healthy relationship with sex as opposed to those oppressed people whose parents only bang to conceive."

Now, I'm a little bit of a kinky girl and I like to suprise my boyfriend. The thought of only ever having sex in the bedroom sounds so boring to me. If we did have children and they were gone, I see no issues banging on the couch. We fuck on the couch now and have guests over, guests sleep in beds they know people have obviously fucked in.
