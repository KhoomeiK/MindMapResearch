TrueOffMyChest,fpd51bs,t3_gciq4l,1588519979.0,"Happy for you! I went through the same thing a couple years ago and am now engaged to the love of my life. It’s crazy what we will put up with, not knowing how much better life can be."

depression,ex3j951,t3_cr3476,1565986438.0,"I feel like this all the time. Part of me thinks killing myself would somehow help everyone else. I realize that’s a stupid way of thinking, but I can’t keep those thoughts out of my mind."
depression,ewdaae6,t3_cnpkwz,1565297552.0,Keep hitting the gym! One of the few things that helps me feel better ... even though I struggle with the motivation to get there.
depression,ew9uxiv,t1_ew9uq5t,1565231573.0,I was an accident for my parents in college ... so I’ve wondered if their lives would be better if I hadn’t come along as well.
depression,ew9tm44,t3_cndfzd,1565230952.0,"You can make it another day my friend. A lot of us here are struggling and think the world would be a better place without us. However, even if you have 1 person that cares about you even the slightest, killing your self is not the option. It’s devastating to the people around you. 

I don’t know you but I love you and know how you feel."
depression,evmiyqr,t3_ck913s,1564608669.0,"I have those internal voices and it goes back and forth on which one is loudest. The scariest time was fairly recent when the “you should kill your self” voice changed to “you have to kill yourself”. The first time it happened, it brought me to tears. Good news is that it has since reverted back to “should” and that’s easier to overcome."

depression,evdfq2w,t3_cjcntr,1564437154.0,"I feel like my motivation comes and goes in cycles. I had been depressed and gained about 30lbs. Finally, I said fuck this and started working out again and eating less (although stress helped with that part), losing the weight. About 6 or so months later I lost motivation again and have gained about 10lbs back. I’m going back to the gym today because I’m not letting myself get fat again. I almost have to get angry to be motivated."

TooAfraidToAsk,ep0onws,t3_btebfu,1558978255.0,Call me when you hit your early 30s. It’s a strange feeling of being in control of your life to an extent but also terrified the best has passed. Now I work and try to avoid health issues.
BikiniBottomTwitter,ep0nmqc,t3_btlrfa,1558977864.0,"I’ve struggled with this but it’s helpful to have a few friends with similar obstacles. Talking with them has made it easier to talk to others, but I always do feel I hold back from being totally honest. I’ll get there one day."
