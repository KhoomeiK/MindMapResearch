AskReddit,fl30fiw,t1_fl2tvbx,1584764919.0,"I guess it depends where and exactly what discipline. A Master's in Music Therapy is different than Master's in Counselling Psychology. 

Where I'm from (BC, Canada), there is unfortunately no protected term for counsellors/therapists, so you can have a certificate in ""counselling"" and still call yourself a counsellor. This is a problem because then uninformed clients equate all counsellors/therapists as being the same. As you can probably (hopefully) imagine, someone with a master's degree and close to 1000 hours of practical experience (which is what is required to get a designation by the BCACC, which is provincial and not government protected) is NOT the same is some random who took a 6-month certificate and calls themselves a counsellor. Here, you could call yourself a counsellor even with a bachelor's degree and next to no practical experience and get away with it. 

I'm sure there are a few individuals who would make fantastic counsellors or teachers or whatever discipline they are from with a bachelors. But, it's likely the case that the majority of people who have just a bachelors are less good than those with a master's. There's a reason than higher education exists, and believe it or not, it's not all for money."
AskReddit,fl2lkab,t1_fl2dh1j,1584753920.0,"No matter what kind of degree is required to become a counsellor, the most important thing is to do a practicum. No amount of group projects, papers, or lectures can even come close to how counselling is in practice. Currently there are no bachelor level programs that offer that, so a master’s is necessary. Although costly, one should be able to make that money back relatively quickly when working as a therapist."
