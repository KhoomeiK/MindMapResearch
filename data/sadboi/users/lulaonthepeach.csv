unpopularopinion,fqs2saw,t1_fqs2b1t,1589597224.0,"It’s the excessive comedy. That’s what i’m referring to. in GOTG, it works ! But think about the difference between the first Avengers film and Endgame, or the first Thor film and Ragnarok. Fat Thor ?? Fortnite ?? Is any of that necessary? 
No. Their slightly comedic movie was a hit, so they decided to add that to so many Marvel movies , whether it’s appropriate or not. Because that shit sells to anyone, not just “nerds”."
movies,fqraajh,t3_gkh8tn,1589580524.0,oh for sure Suicide Squad. I could go on about this movie for hours but i’ll keep this brief. I was a big fan of the comics and the original Harley Quinn character and the film did none of it justice. I was excited to have all my friends discover my favourite comic series and it was ... beyond disappointing. I do believe Margo Robbie did kind of redeem herself and her character in Birds of Prey but man... I’ve lost lots of respect for Jared Leto as an actor and this movie has tainted the series forever.

unpopularopinion,fqqr73r,t1_fqqlvvu,1589570492.0,no omg you’re not alone. It’s so sad how as soon as they saw the success of Guardians of the Galaxy they thought that they could make every single movie the same kind of funny ha-ha shit (example: Thor Ragnarok) and its just formulaic and not even good at this point. Quite the tragedy

AskReddit,fn24fui,t3_fyvnsx,1586577577.0,"sometimes really empowering and other times kinda horrifying . As a woman, i know i can kinda use my body or the way i dress to get men interested in me if i want , as in dress cute to attract someone’s attention if i want to. Sometimes it’ll attract someone’s attention even by accident and depending on the person, it can be really flattering and exciting.
On the other hand , i very rarely dress for anyone else , and i often like to wear skirts and cropped tops or whatever ... which attracts the attention of more creepy people than potentially interesting people. My instagram is full of DMs and comments saying how the person noticed i never wear a bra, and that’s really just insulting and gross.
Also confusing because while you think someone may be interested in you as a person, they may just be trying to take you to bed which is just really discouraging...
All in all, a blessing and a curse."

AskReddit,flvt71d,t3_fraceg,1585531537.0,"I was working in a grocery store when i was 16. regular 5-9 shift , just doing my stuff in my department by myself. I prepared fruit and vegetable platters, and i would just use the stuff that were on the shelves for the clients. I go out to grab some grapes and i walk past this man, obviously in his 40s-50s. He smiles at me and like any young girl in customer service , i smile back. He starts talking to me , complimenting me , even saying “it’s so nice to be looked at by eyes as beautiful as yours”... definitely creepy . The guy was asking me questions about myself , even begging me to write my phone number on the price sticker of the next item i made. He wasn’t extraordinarily pushy but something felt off. i told him i would look for a pen, and while i opened a drawer at my station i discretely dropped the pen that was in my uniform on the ground , then told him i didn’t have any. He asked me if i worked again the next day, and i replied i didn’t know , but i was working . He told me he would come back. 

On my break i called my dad to tell him about the incident, so he called the police to make a report against this guy. My manager didn’t seem concerned , thinking no one would be stupid enough to come back two days in a row. But he did. My manager scared him off, and he left the store.

Upon talking with other customers , it appeared he always came to the store with a friend , but every time he came up to me he was alone . He and his friend were planning something , but i suppose he came to me alone to try to make me more comfortable. They would walk through the store, pick things up, then just drop them all on a random shelf before leaving empty handed. Some coworker also identified the car they had as they drove off, and my dad told me he saw that car in the grocery store parking lot EVERY NIGHT, very late and for a very long time .

Turns out , around that time, lots of girls in my area had gone missing. Including one girl that looked so much like me and was of the same age, who had gone to work at another grocery store , but was never heard from again.

Shoutout to my dad for calling the cops and shoutout to my gut for saving me from getting abducted"
