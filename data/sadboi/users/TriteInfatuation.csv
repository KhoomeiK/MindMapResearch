I’m not sure which is worse anymore. I relate a lot to what you said, for me it’s essentially that whoever upset me suddenly feels like a stranger to me. 

I always feel guilty after."

BPD,f3rf5yn,t3_dhvbae,1571087490.0,I think for me it’s that I (despite my *best* efforts) get my hopes up. I let myself get excited about something happening (even if the plans are simple) and I feel such a visceral pain when they change because my brain reads it as rejection. It’s irrational but it feels real to me.
BPD,f3rev23,t3_dhvfph,1571087372.0,"I find a strong pull to reaching out to not just exes but anyone from my past. Usually it’s to apologize but also the incessant need to try to make them understand what I’m feeling, to be understood.

BPD,ezfpm0k,t3_d0tp0d,1567881254.0,"Yes, all the time. I say I’d die for my s/o not just because it’s an expression but because I actually would. Without hesitation. It’s strange to feel so intensely all the time and not get the same in return. 

But at the same time I feel *guilty* because I can’t help but tell him how much I love him. All the time. Constantly. And I’ve got it twisted in my brain that if he doesn’t say it as often as I do, he doesn’t love me anymore and he’s going to leave. 

It wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t every day and there was no escape lmao"

BPD,exzfmdg,t3_cutbq1,1566665350.0,"I’m also on the asexual spectrum (demi) so outside of when I’m in a relationship I feel no sexual attraction to anyone. When I am in one, however, I’m also like another commenter here where I need sex to feel validated in the relationship (at least on my bad days) but the fear of rejection usually has me not initiating. 

I am however bad at keeping my emotions in and I’ll usually tell my boyfriend. Unlike my previous relationships, he is incredibly understanding and patient with me. Be it indulging me or being super gentle with his rejections when he can’t at the moment, he makes it so much easier. 

You’re definitely not alone. It blows my mind how every day things I don’t even realize affect me are BPD struggles others feel."

Pretty much all reactions are rooted in my self loathing, but I’ve been in relationships that made me want to leave because I wanted to cause the pain I was feeling. 

It’s a double edged sword either way."
