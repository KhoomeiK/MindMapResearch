AskReddit,fn9gli2,t3_g05c2r,1586772192.0,"1. I have issues. Im usually a very calm person, but when i get mad i have violent thoughts (never gotten violent but thats a concern). Also have severe emotional issues and anxiety that i dont want to pass on
2. Crippling migraines. Luckily birth control helped a lot so now i only get a really bad one every 2 months or so. Im not willing to a) pass them on or b) deal with them again for 9 months since they used to be a weekly occurance.
3. I have really bad joints/connctive tissue. Idk what it is, but I am at least in mild pain every day and have been for about 2 years.
4. Kids stress me out and theyre messy. Im ocd and get very stressed out. Loud and constant noises bother me, even worse if its yelling children. I also get a sensory overload thing where I freakout and certain noises are deafening (like one person's vioce will go from normal to screaming and the  only thing i can hear for no reason in like 2 seconds flat and i have to hide or i get severe panic attacks)
5. Also have a dissociation thing where i forget what im doing, where i am, and who I am, only under severe stress luckily (only in my past relationship then it stopped thank God). And after reading my great grandmothers journal its hereditary to at least a certian degree because she had the same thing (to the point of being institutioned). I also 'shut down' when I get too emotional and I physically cant talk and stop functioning.

Im planning on getting my tubes tied when im a little older due to potential medical/mental issues being passed on"

Ive even lied sorta to my bf. Since weve got together ive told him every time ive done it. Except twice. First i was using him (steering the convo) to trigger my ed, so I cut while I waited for him to come back after getting food. No many but I never said anything. And two weeks ago I wrote bad into my arm. Idk felt right, but obviously never told him. The only two times he hasnt known. And I feel bad.

I have never been so horrifyingly despaired and sad, while being so God damn happy that I woke up and my mom was there to comfort me and the family dog sat by me all day guarding me because she knew I was sick.

He went through a bad divorce with a girl He thought was the best girl in the world. Idk your case, but to him she was emotionally,sometimes physically abusive, cruel, and constantly made him worried she was going to leave. Also they had big fights that would sometimes last for days. In the end she separated, moved out fucked some guy, got back with j fter a month, only because she was sick and the other guy had a fiance. They got back together for two weeks before she claimed j abused her, pushed her around, and did all these horrible things to her when she mostly did those to him. And hes been stuck jobless in life for 5 years because of it.
But he never pulled the trigger. He kept going, and now wete going to meet up irl next August and eventually get married. He can now see just how mean and bad she was for him.
