I do agree that calling a whole race racist is racist, and here’s why: there’s a bunch of countries - maybe small and not very powerful, but still existent - that are populated with white people whose ancestors had nothing to do with the racism that happened in other countries or by their doing, yet they still get judged. 

My ancestry is mostly from European countries that had absolutely nothing to do with slavery or segregation or in any way harming another race, but I’m still always put in the same box with the people who descended from the perpetrators. 

Not saying that someone should be blamed simply for being a descendant, but it’s reasonable to expect them to take a stance about an issue in their country that their ancestors contributed to. It’s not reasonable to expect me to be apologetic when not only my nation did nothing, it also suffered from the same or similar groups that people or color did. We were also seen as ‘lower’ in many parts of Europe and we still are, and we’re barely seen as white by those groups, if at all. But we’re apparently white enough to be judged in the race centric society. 

Me being dominantly white doesn’t say enough about my heritage or opinions - nowhere near enough to be judged at a first glance. In USA, and some other countries, the basic division is just by race - in most of Europe, there’s much more to add. But if you find yourself in USA, it barely counts. I have to give a whole presentation to explain my lands of origin as they are. My self identity and beliefs aren’t based on the simple grounds of being white - I have a whole culture and national identity to add to that which does not in any way include all the negatives attributed to whites in the western world today."

It’s more reasonable to expect a person that’s against those rules to speak up on time, rather than the ones who adhere to them, because they’re pretty much the norm, as you can see by it even being a popular ‘code’ and the responses here.

Like it’s totally fine to have an open marriage if both parties agree, but the one who wants to start the open part of it would be expected to say so, not the monogamous one to say they want it to be monogamous because it’s the norm that it is.

It’s not about choosing between one person’s feeling of loss or another’s of attraction in a vacuum of objectivity and with disconnection from all the subtleties of interpersonal relationships or the relationships themselves, it’s actually weighing if fucking someone you’re attracted to is worth hurting a friend to you.  

To some people it is, to some not, but that’s the choice being made, not a philosophical decision on what and whose feeling would take precedence.

In some places, where the transit is reasonably reliable albeit sometimes late, there’s no excuse for always being late. However I lived in my country of origin for a short while and the transit was not on time most of the time - it was surprising when it actually was - and not only was it late, scheduled times would be skipped, you’d have three times just skipped and then one vehicle would go at a random time in between the last time it should have and the next set take off. You really couldn’t predict that so it made more sense to say you’re going to be at the location AROUND 6, so it can be half past 5 or half past 6. Can’t guarantee for something you have no control over.
There were always people who drive, pay for cabs or walk several kilometers to where they’re supposed to be - they could usually get there on time, but it wouldn’t be fair to expect everyone to spend the same money or to have the energy to walk that long. 
It’s got nothing to do with situations where someone has the means to get to a place on time but chooses not to, however there are situations where it’s just not possible to be exact with timing.

Edit: I also realized that for someone who has always set times as around 6, not at 06:00; it would probably be hard to get used to exact timing. Not an excuse not to try, but it takes time."

Because the former is clearly correct, but the latter is a very complicated matter.
Right or wrong is just a belief - you think it’s right to make people more equal, someone thinks it’s right to be allowed to leave your estate to your children without it being made unnecessarily difficult because it’s, after all, your estate.
You can’t decide on an universal right and wrong in a situation like this.
When it comes the institution of inheritance in general, the reason it’s shaped the way it is is to allow private property to continue to exist, allow people to provide for their children post mortem and to ensure the freedom of disposition of property which is considered important in a country with a rule of law.
Discarding it all for complete equality just isn’t logical in the situation where the country declares in their legal system the rights related to private property but not obligatory equalization in terms of wealth.

TwoXChromosomes,f7eaymd,t1_f7e85qb,1573652696.0,"There’s a difference between ‘all the nice things’ and ‘basic things you need in the modern times’ - the latter is actually a fine condition when it comes to having kids. It’s not fair to have children that you can’t provide for, they’re people too, from the moment they’re born, you can’t just look at a distant point in time 20 and more years later when they may have a chance to improve their situation."

I don’t know who is it that says it’s the man’s fault that the woman is cheating - but that’s almost never true

Unless the partner that’s getting cheated on is abusive and stops the cheating partner from leaving them in a threatening way, it’s definitely not their fault

It’s he cheaters lack of principles and character and they would do it to anyone - the next partner they get may be completely different than you and they’d still get the same treatment because it’s the cheater that’s on the wrong path, not the people around them

I’m sorry for your experiences so far, but you know your children both love and need you and they’re the new chance at having good things happen - your parental figures obviously weren’t good but you can be a good one and have good kids to be happy with 

There’s a lot of things to look forward to and your first step is just starting to take care of yourself step by step

Don’t overwork yourself for your wife’s whims - make sure you provide for your kids but you don’t need to break your back to fulfill your cheating wife’s caprices

Take some time to rest and be with the kids and honestly, it would be best to find a way to separate from your wife

There’s different women in this world who won’t treat you that way and you deserve the chance to find one

Oh and also - I’m a daughter without a dad - it’s a very shitty situation to find yourself in. 
Save your babies from that shitty-ness"

They’re probably like why would you bother to put things away all the time when you’re pulling them out in a few hours anyways? Not that I agree, but not everyone organizes their space the same way"

gatekeeping,f6uebbm,t1_f6u1hy1,1573161722.0,"Imperialism doesn’t do much for the common man and even if it did, not all the countries in Europe were imperialistic. For example, the south of Europe has experienced as much as the rest of the world in the past century and in some places, they still are, but that’s not a relevant experience because it’s not related to race specifically, right? It’s okay to only want to focus on racially themed literature but dismissing anything else and pretending that’s being objective is a whole another story."
gatekeeping,f6tyazg,t1_f6t44fw,1573155679.0,You think that the only relevant part of someone’s background is their race? That may work in the USA but the world doesn’t end on the US borders.
gatekeeping,f6ty3z2,t1_f6st3c2,1573155608.0,"What you’re saying can only be interpreted as you thinking only USA based people write books, because no one in their right mind can think that the life experiences of a white person in the USA, then for example Germany and let’s say Russia can be the same just because they’re white. Especially when we take into consideration the fact that we don’t only read books written this year - experiences in different time periods are different even in one country, let alone across the world, which is not limited to the USA. So when you think about the fact that there were and are white people living in different cultures throughout different time periods it’s really clear they can’t all be the same person and can’t write the same books. There are European countries whose natives had experiences far different from anything that happened in the USA."
