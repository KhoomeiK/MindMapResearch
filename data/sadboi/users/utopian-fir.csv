BDSMcommunity,fqq1474,t1_fqobhfs,1589557596.0,"I like the table idea because it can facilitate multiple points of contact and spread out the restraints. We are trying mummification of my torso and arms this weekend, but depending on how that goes, we may explore the table route. 

And yeah, I’m with you on the anxiety about making a mess. Luckily, my Dom is extremely chill about that.

Thanks for your help!"

BDSMcommunity,fqq06hw,t1_fqnnlcw,1589557132.0,"We have tried that multiple times, but unless he’s using his full body, arms and legs, to pin me down, I always wiggle out (flexible and tiny). He also wants at least one hand available to work the hitachi because he knows the exact spot on my clit that’s the most intense for me and he really likes to play with it."

running,fp26pr2,t1_fp1n1k2,1588256245.0,Thanks for sharing your story. That’s a really helpful way of looking at things. It may be that I just need time off. That’ll be hard during this pandemic.
running,fp26elv,t1_fp0sr1t,1588256074.0,"Yeah, actually before the pandemic I was getting myself ready for my first triathlon, so I was running, biking, and swimming every week. Once the pandemic hit, I had to stop swimming, but I’ve continued with biking. I may need to increase my cycling and decrease my running significantly for awhile."
running,fp262j9,t1_fp0oy7f,1588255882.0,"That’s a great idea, thank you. I think I’ll do that when I’m feeling well enough to run again."

running,fp25u0s,t1_fozzcss,1588255746.0,"Yeah, Thank you. I’ve been foam rolling. It’s part of my PT programming. I think they ruled out bursitis from my MRIs. Thank you for the encouragement."
running,fp06eux,t1_fp04wau,1588203350.0,"I have been cycling, too. Before this pandemic, I was getting ready for my first triathlon, actually. Sprint distance. I was trying to alternate running and cycling, but maybe I should just take a break for a bit and just ride my bike."
running,fp065rz,t1_fozz18x,1588203217.0,"Yes, foam rolling has been part of my PT programming. And I recently switched to running on a flat track at a community college near my house because it’s a lower impact than the sidewalk. I’m still only able to squeak out a mile before the pain sets in :("

running,fozszpd,t1_fozsadx,1588196333.0,"The pain in my hip is closer to the iliac crest. My knee pain is on the outer edge of the knee, so I thought ITBS, too. My physical therapist thinks my hip and knee pain are connected and that the IT band is caught in the crossfire. 

Another confounding variable is that with the covid pandemic, I can’t see my PT in person now, so we’ve been doing telehealth appointments where I show and describe the pain as best as I can."
BPD,fovqzga,t3_g9smkr,1588106013.0,"I totally feel this, too.

I’m a quite borderline, so when I get my feelings hurt, I withdraw automatically because I never know whether I’m just being overly emotional, reacting too intensely, or actually have a valid concern. It leaves my friends and partners very confused, especially if I eventually decide that I did overreact.

I often find that I have to ask my therapist or my friends whether something I experienced is reasonable to be upset about. Only when I receive validation do I feel comfortable talking it out with the person who upset me."
kinky,foefpn7,t3_g7141x,1587702645.0,"You should communicate your boundaries clearly and early on. Tell him this is new for you and that you’re willing to try it, but that you’re also a bit hesitant. Make sure you establish safe words and signals. Talk to him about what he wants to do before you play together. Make sure you both agree on what’s going to happen. And communicate what YOU want out of that playtime. Is it to just explore? Is it to feel a certain feeling? Is it something else? Tell him that so he knows what you want.

As for the “once you go kinky, you can’t go back to vanilla” I don’t know what to tell you. I’ve only gotten kinkier as I’ve gotten older haha but everyone’s different.

Good luck, be safe, and have fun!"

BPD,flhztd9,t3_fow77e,1585172594.0,"Yes, so much yes to this! My fp is a gentleman in the military. I love him so much. We’ve been dating for about a year. Next year, his time will be up for this base and he will be sent somewhere else. I can’t come with him because I’m polyamorous and married and I can’t just leave my husband, my career, my friends, to follow him.

This situation has been a source of great anxiety, and I find myself agonizing over it and obsessively mourning the eventual end of the relationship. Sometimes I disconnect from him, sometimes I talk about it with him. The feelings are so intense, and he says he shares my sadness, but I know it can’t possibly be as extreme as mine. 

I obsess over how bad it’s gonna feel when he leaves. I run through crazy scenarios in my head where I *do* leave everything behind just to follow him and be with him. He really wants to have children so terribly badly, and I definitely do not want children, so I also run through crazy scenarios where I agree to have children with him so I can follow him and make him happy.

Ultimately, I know I’ll eventually just have to suck it up and say goodbye, and that mourning it repeatedly right now just steals the joys we have left, but as you all know, it’s hard to stop that."
childfree,fkrldja,t1_fkrl7qm,1584471129.0,"I think the difference is that many parents are now teleworking, and having to deal with their kids while they’re trying to get work done (what a concept!). Whereas in the summer, many parents are able to arrange for childcare and summer camps."
childfree,fkr8td1,t1_fkr4tzc,1584464064.0,"That is absolutely true. If I could hand an iPad to poorly behaved students like their parents do while the rest of the class learned, my job would be a lot less stressful and we’d get a lot more done."
BPD,fj6ci1m,t1_fj6bs14,1583067159.0,"Yes, I hear you on that. And that’s honestly what prompted this post in the first place. My fp went on a date last night. Though I love all 3 of my partners, one of them is my fp, and he doesn’t date much, but when he does, I am so anxious about it that I feel physically ill."
BorderlinePDisorder,fj4hwno,t3_fbc87h,1583008656.0,"For years I saw the same therapist for depression and anxiety. I always had this nagging feeling that we were missing something, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was. I’d show up to therapy on “good” depression/anxiety days knowing that, despite the fact that I wasn’t suicidal, something else seemed perpetually off just under the surface, something separate from depression that made me feel like I had immense trouble functioning.

It wasn’t until my spouse and I started going to couples therapy that we discovered my borderline pd. The therapist suggested that she and I do some “inner child” work in an individual session. I looked up inner child work, which led me to borderline, and I felt this mixture of shock and relief because it perfectly described what was missing from the years that my previous therapist had been treating me for depression and anxiety. The very next session my therapist did an evaluation, and sure enough I had borderline. 

This was all about a month ago, so I’m still coming to terms with it."
