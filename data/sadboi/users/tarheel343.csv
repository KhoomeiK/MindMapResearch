A lot of beginners ask ""how do you acquire prisoners, and how do you keep them in?"" The answer is patience. That and reinforced steel and concrete.

A big rookie mistake is to hastily grab homeless people off the street, but they tend to be docile, and might just see it as a free meal and a place to sleep. I can't fall asleep at night unless I can hear faint screaming coming from the basement, so it's important to capture people who want to get out.

Just my two cents for anyone who's considering thinking of getting into amateur imprisonment."

Life is just tough, y'know? Sometimes I just blurt out pieces of my life on reddit. Maybe it's cathartic, I don't know. But I usually find kind people like you. So thanks for taking time out of your day to care for a stranger."
battlefield_4,fk070mp,t1_fk04ihr,1583744906.0,"Ah ok, I didn't know that. Hopefully bottom of the leaderboard gets kicked. Would suck to be on a hot streak and get booted by some 13 year old who pays for the server with moms credit card."
ABoringDystopia,fk06x68,t1_fjztji2,1583744768.0,"I'm in a nearly identical situation. I'm feeling like I could mentally crumble at any moment. Family connection with the company, all that stuff.

I'm scared."
ABoringDystopia,fk06tey,t1_fk01q41,1583744619.0,"I think the main issue here is with the label CEO. Being a CEO doesn't automatically mean you're rich and can retire whenever you want. Often it means you run a small company and one wrong decision, or one lost client could mean you go bankrupt and like 20 other people lose their jobs.

I work for a company that would go under if we lost our biggest client. I have a family member who runs a company of about 15 people, and it's barely grown since he started it. It's massively stressful being an entrepreneur who isn't wildly successful (like Bezos and Bloomberg).

I'd also like to add that I think wealth inequality is destroying the world and that I voted for Bernie on super tuesday. I'd go so far as to say that the very existence of billionaires is immoral.

But I stand by my point that CEO doesn't equal 'set for life'."

rva,fjzi36x,t1_fjzhcda,1583720248.0,A decent casino on the river in Manchester where some of that old industrial space is wouldn't be so bad.
rva,fjzh7g9,t1_fjzgj4a,1583719647.0,Interesting. Thanks for the info. What do you think are some potential locations?
rva,fjzgano,t1_fjzg7ma,1583719044.0,I know nothing about these things. What makes you say that?
rva,fjzg5gf,t3_ffgkz8,1583718947.0,What are the odds Richmond city council would ever approve construction of a casino in the city?
rva,fjzdjpl,t3_ffml9z,1583717198.0,"Okay my girlfriend just texted me from work that she has the inside scoop on this thing (and to expect a picture on reddit), and then didn't text me back when I asked about it."
battlefield_4,fjyxlj3,t3_ffdk55,1583706750.0,Don't they reserve the 64th slot for the server owner sometimes?
AskReddit,fjymhgh,t1_fjxwecw,1583699933.0,"My ex-roommate almost died from this. We were in college, did blow probably once a month. He was at the apartment alone and had a couple of beers. He went for the blow and just collapsed on the floor. It was laced with fentanyl. Luckily his girlfriend was on her way over and our neighbor was an EMT.

If it were me, I would have died on the spot because of medication interactions. I could handle some booze and blow just fine on the meds, but combine all of that with fentanyl, and it would have been instant death. I decided to go sober only weeks earlier because I wasn't really having fun anymore, and I wanted to get off my anxiety meds, which takes a ton of effort and lifestyle changes.

He hasn't touched drugs since, besides the occasional puff of weed and a few drinks on special occasions. He's got a good job and a the same loving girlfriend who saved his life. To think that he was just minutes away from death sickens me. I grew up with this guy. His family was like a second family to me."
AskReddit,fjutqpg,t1_fjtuf6e,1583620155.0,Ignore it. It absolutely ruins the flow of a good thread when someone adds an award speech edit.
AskReddit,fjurmvu,t1_fjspgt5,1583619530.0,"If anyone truly claims to like music, they don't block out entire genres. Subgenres on the other hand... fuck pop country.

Additionally, the Xbox/PS thing probably stems from jealousy. Most people can only afford one system, and they're locked in for life with backwards compatibility now. So Xbox owners are probably jealous of the amazing Playstation exclusives, and I know that as a PS4 owner I'm massively jealous of Xbox Gamepass. (And as a car enthusiast, I'm really jealous of Forza Horizon 4)."
