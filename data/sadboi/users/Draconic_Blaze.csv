I'm transgender, and I was going through a really tough time and I actually got hospitalized after attempted suicide , and my pastor visited me in the hospital, immediately referred to me as my prefferred name and pronouns. She said a prayer with me and set up a prayer quilt for me. (I'm not sure if anyone knows what this is, so I'll explain it. Basically, it says who's it is and what it's for, and then everyone who says a prayer ties a knot on a string on it, so you have a reminder of how many people care about you.) One of the people who works there even wore a Pride shirt there a few times.
