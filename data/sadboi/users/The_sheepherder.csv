So when they don't respond or very short I'll feel bad, but I remind myself that they could be busy, in a hurry or other circumstances and it has nothing to do with me. I keep reminding myself this with all interactions and tell myself it's ok."

Give it some more time to see if this job fits you. The fact that they hired you means that the see something in you. They believe in you. I believe in you. You already made it this far. Don't let your anxiety stop you now."
Anxiety,fg5023n,t3_ewwhm7,1580515007.0,"It took me about 3,5 months to settle into my new job. My stress and anxiety went up and down. 

Give yourself some more time to see if this job is right for you. Ask other people at work for advice to improve yourself. Ask them how they would handle a certain situation.

It's hard, but it will get better. Take a couple deep breaths. Be kind to yourself. Listen to some happy music on your way to work. Treat yourself with some snacks and a fluffy blanket when you come home. Don't forget you are strong‚ù§"
Anxiety,fg3noxq,t3_ewpue2,1580485752.0,"Yes, I know what you mean. Suddenly something triggers me and I feel so much frustration and rage inside. It's out of proportion. I do push ups or an other workout routine to get it out of my system."

Anxiety,ffi1bhj,t1_ffi0f0q,1579962099.0,"You should notice a difference within a hour. Maybe it will not work on you. Everybody is different. 

You should talk to a doctor or professional. I don't know your situation, so I can't tell you if it's ok to take an other one. I'm sorry."
Anxiety,ffhyb30,t3_etpcmb,1579959105.0,"I have used it in the past. It makes you feel calm, more relax en my anxiety was less.

In the begining you can get very drowsy. So you have to be careful. Also your body will get used to it. So eventually you will have to take more oxazepam for the same effect. Some people get addicted."

Maybe she has an other method to try and if not, then maybe she can recommend an other therapist."
