We closed the door, tried to get the spiders off, then pleasantly discovered many other rooms that were amazingly ornate. I went on a treasure hunt through the old lady’s belongings that were willed to us, and found zero spiders.

While it happened I disassociated, completely. It was pretty rough sex, which was our norm, but this time there was no check ins, he never stopped to ask why I went limp. Why I kept my hands up to my face and shook like crazy. 

It never happened before, and it was months until we were intimate again. But god damn, my stupid heart and emotions. Sex and love can be so mixed up sometimes. I regret so much of what I’ve done since then. 

I realized that over the years I’ve let myself become a person who just fills voids in others lives, who takes up the empty places in their hearts until someone they actually want comes along. 

And, shamefully, I guess I’ve become complacent and figure if they’ll keep me around for the sex, at least I’m worth *something* to them.

Sometimes it feels like I can see the light everywhere, with all my senses, and even when I close my eyes I can feel it’s warmth and know I’m safe.

Other times I’m lost in a dark forest, following a trail of broken tiny candles with wicks just long enough to get me to the next small flame. With each step the danger of the light I’m holding going out is terrifying. I never know if I’ll make it to the next candle and light the flame before the old one goes out.

Sometimes it seems like the light has gone out completely. 
Other times, it’s so bright I cannot fathom the depths of darkness I’ve found myself in.

It’s a daily struggle, but I’ll be damned if I won’t learn how to make fire myself
