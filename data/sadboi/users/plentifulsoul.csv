If you ever feel it‚Äôs overwhelming, insomniac always has a ‚Äúconscious group‚Äù booth and you just walk up to them and they‚Äôre a support group for people who basically don‚Äôt do any drugs or alcohol. I walked up to them just to say hi and they‚Äôre the most nicest understanding people ever (they‚Äôre right by the huge food area). 

Everyone is extremely nice at festivals and like the above person said, the only people that stick out are douches who shove n push but even they sometimes even say sorry.

Nobody cares how or when you‚Äôre dancing because everyone is in their own world lol 

Definitely tell people it‚Äôs your first time if you‚Äôre comfortable enough. I Promise you‚Äôll strike up a great convo that way with any stranger. 

Tip: Make sure your belongings (cell phone and money) are well secured because pickpocketers do exist. 

Most importantly, let go, be free and enjoy!
