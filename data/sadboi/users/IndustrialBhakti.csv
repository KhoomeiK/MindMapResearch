Hence I had a complex, gradual path toward development of quiet BPD symptoms. I was not finally diagnosed with BPD till 35."

I know that comes across as glib and light on meaningful consideration of the complexities of any relationship. His treatment of you however is the nadir of what one ought to expect from even a casual acquaintance. His focus on your relationship with a man who has just died in the most tragic way should disqualify him from being anyone's romantic partner. There is nothing recoverable in that. Do you want to be with someone unable or unwilling to put anyone's feelings, not even those of the woman he claims to love, ahead of his own, even to just let them process grief? I am sorry. I am so utterly sorry. You deserve support right now, and the one person who should be providing it in spades without hesitation is doing his best to make this even more traumatic for you. I don't suggest breaking up is easy by any means, but he just failed a test the vast majority would at least pass, and he failed it miserably."

Could even make a game of the cockwarming itself. The better shes does, the more I do for her."

I get frustrated that I still spend most of my time just watching other people live their lives because I feel no interest or investment in my own. I feel like I am this white nothing I only grudgingly spend any time with, let alone help with employment or self-improvement or money too (i.e. save) like I would for anyone I cared about.

That way I am using the medium as a way to actively participate in life rather than constantly traumatise myself with things I want but can't have right now. Right now being the important thing to remember. This is not forever. It is also helps us remain anchored in our own identity which is really at the core of what we are suffering from.

You have cleared out as many false starts and dead ends as I have with a 14 year head start. I know the pain of failure and crushed expectations, and only 36 hours ago came close to pulling the pin on myself. But I look up to you. Compared to me, you're beasting life tooth and claw. Trust me 22 is far, *far* from too late to make some major course corrections and get back closer to where you want to be. And btw you are allowed to be weak. Fuck the parasites who demand your strength for their comfort. Cry on the sofa for a week if it means you preserve your strength to use for *you*.

BPD,fmo3wya,t1_fmgbhpm,1586244465.0,"Yes, I am struggling with exactly this. I hate my life on an ontological level: the laws of causality have cut me off from happiness. There is nothing anyone can give me or do for me that will alter that. Every day I continue to live here is another day delaying the inevitable while I figure out how to exit this consciousness with the least amount of damage left behind. 
Love is the poison. If I didn't love her to the point I can't face life without her, the whole predicament would be moot. If my friends and family did not love me I could have already popped the hatch on this fucking shit tunnel of an experience. Instead I have dozens of foul shit-smeared hands clawing at my heart strings, and like a fucking coward, I always give in to them. How sad they will be if I ""kill"" myself. I don't really know if anything but myself is real. I don't even know if *I* am real. Yet, here I am whining about it to yet more people I don't actually know are real. Fuck my lives, all of them... except that one where it was all so beautiful and so definitely real."

BPD,fk0dmlj,t3_ffqk6k,1583753376.0,"Definitely. I (36M) always knew there was something else wrong with me (on top of an alphabet soup of other diagnoses). I just never knew what. I would never in a million years have guessed BPD. Fortunately my psychiatrist did. I have been seeing him since I was 19. He has observed the fall out of all my adult relationships. After the last one, he ventured something I sooo didn't expect. I knew the intensity with which I grieved every relationship and the very long duration of grieving I suffered was abnormal. But I just thought it was because I am a loser. My psych however suggested BPD. I am all-in on relationships. I completely and totally invest beyond what most people would. And I refuse to see the warning signs that the other person is pulling away. I see it happening but I pretend it isn't what it is. I get into relationships with people who hurt me again and again and never seem to learn. Then when it inevitably implodes, I implode with it because being that persons partner is all that mattered to me.  I feel there is nothing inside that makes me, me. I'm just something to be molded around somebody else. My ex-wife noticed that a decade ago. I always thought that was normal. I guess a lot of you also know that feeling, and know it all too well."
BPD,fjzy3md,t1_fjzp3n8,1583733500.0,"It's something I have learned again and again. People always wish you'd said something sooner, and feel terrible that you suffered in silence. If they don't, try to find better people. 
That said, I am also learning why my best friend once told me I was difficult to be friends with sometimes. I now consciously make an effort to always be the best friend I can. It doesn't always get reciprocated, but it's not a transaction, it's just being your best self."

I think there is definitely a lot more than anxiety and depression going on. I recognise a lot of your symptoms and behaviours in myself (except the mouth pain). I was recently diagnosed as having Borderline Personality Disorder and have just started Dialectical Behaviour Therapy for it. It is not my place to recommend anything of course, but if this or something similar has not been explored yet perhaps it is worth doing so before proceeding with non-reversible courses of action? I say this in hope that it is BPD or something else responsive to the DBT treatment because I have found it effective in managing excruciating emotions that previously would have left me shattered and defunct for a week."
