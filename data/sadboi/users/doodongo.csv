Social skills is a tough one for me though and I have very little to talk about. I believe a big part of it is that I lack a hobby or a passion and my free time I tend to lie down because I feel like they are chores themselves."
depression,euhrm87,t1_eugldyi,1563832828.0,Like typically its depression or anxiety. Its the fact that it feels like an effort to do little tasks makes me unable to do anything else other than work. I guess I just want to play video games or work on my hobbies and beable to talk about them. The fact that I have nothing to talk about is terrible for me because it just reminds me that I do nothing.
depression,eucls9l,t1_euci585,1563678823.0,"I think I explained enough but I can elabrate.

1. There needs to be a good balance between work and fun. Basically my life is just focused on work, school, and finances. As an engineering student its hard to find time to do things. When I attempt to play video games, my guitar, DnD, watch anime, etc, I tend to get demotivated so fast. There are times where being casual and fun is important and not think about how pointless it is. Thankfully this experience bypassed my depression.

2. If it was me years ago, I would have thought of a strip club as a dirty place. Its quite safe as long as you follow the rules. These girls that work here are strippers, not prostitutes, totally different. 

3. I also had focus my thoughts on my crush. After going my mind open that I should open up to other girls and not focus and waste my time on one. Its also important to have fun with them and not think about relationships. I went in there knowing I wasn't going to get a gf or getting laid because it wasn't what I was looking for when I was there. I know I wasn't going to date anyone (as intended) and I know that is ok.

4. Things are almost never how you would expect, and the only way to know is to try."

They help. They don't make me feel better but it gives me the ability to get out of bed and atleast do things ( Like cleaning the house, showering, do schoolwork, etc. ). No antidepressants will not cure your depression, they just treat the symptoms.

As for side effects.... At first I experience diziness, nausea, and felt more tired than usually. These side effects are minor and I notice they go away before a whole month.

I say take them, overall they are safe to use. Keep in mind if you are on them you must stay on them. I actually skipped days so I can go drinking or I forget due to my busy schedule, I will break off to a manic attack and have severe suicidal thoughts. Just be responsible for your dosages. Keep alcohol in moderation.

Be sure you have therapy as well to help cure your depression. The meds are just a drug that corrects your neuromembranes, it has to be up to you how you want to change your life."

My Dad actually is trying to convince me that school is a waste of money even though I'm working on an engineering degree. I find working in warehouse or labor jobs more depressing, especially since I started school late (23) and some of my peers have degrees. I actually prefer school over work. I think he just wants me to work so I can have just enough to live on my own and I can fuck off from his life.
My Dad feels cursed to have me and thinks of me as a worthless idiot and I get told daily of how much better life is if I weren't around. I feel like he hated me since I was born. I always feel abandoned.
My mother (asian) is actually more caring about me and is more supportive of me going to school since she knows I don't want to work in the warehouse industry for the rest of my life and follow my passion. My mom was always pressuring me to go to school and now I'm glad I'm in that game.

Actually get to know people and only people that are interested in you, you shouldn't have to work too hard just to talk to them once in a while. If you can trust each other you can try to show vulnerability to each other and you realize that nobody has perfect lives. Only get to know people through communication, you shouldn't have be only lurking other peoples posts if they are not interested in you.
Its hard, I've deleted 4 facebook accounts in my life time because I can't handle that bullshit. I have a ghost facebook account now that only exists so people don't ask me why I don't have one.

When appoaching her and ask her a couple of questions, like her favorite food or where she was born or anything, just to show interest. Ask her when she is available to hang out and take her out. When out ask as much questions as you can and try to focus on getting to know her. Maintain eye contact and be sure you listen to things she says. Be sure that the experience is positive.
I never wrote a letter like you but I did do something similar in the past where this girl is always smiling or looking at me and I could never make a move because I was too shy. Worst thing that can happen is that she will say no... her loss. Just try not to be a stalker and text her everyday hour when she is busy.
I never had an actual girlfriend but Ive been through a number of dates. The reason why I dont have one because I realize that I need to heal my depression first and I can't drag someone else into my b.s. Its up to you what you want to do but be aware that your depression can work against your relationship with your SO and you may need professional help. If your SO really cares though she will help you get healed but don't think of it as a final cure and this can lead to toxic relationships."

Being alone and depressed is very unproductive, lying down in bed always feeling sorry for yourself doesn't get anywhere. Yes working on yourself is important, but certainly a lot of depressed people are mentally incapable of doing that. Its important to have someone that cares for you, especially if you had a terrible childhood. Being a shut-in and isolating yourself is unhealthy.
Also while a SO or a close friend isn't a cure, if they truly care about you they would help you try to find that cure.
Though I do agree that you should work on yourself. You should be-able to love yourself. Be sure to see a specialist that can help."

I decide to take some first year courses online and my grades for all thoses courses are As. Now I finished first year mechanical engineering with a 3.6 GPA. 
I'm gonna say I don't think I'm very smart, even though people at school say I am. Don't let some IQ test and high school grades bring you down... I find most people that do bad in high school isn't usually because of intellegence but more to do with the fact that your forced to do a bunch of couses you don't need. High school is such a waste of time, it's really more of a prison than an education facility.
This isn't really much of a success story, I'm still depressed as fuck and I still lie down in bed outside of my studying time. I still hate my life.
