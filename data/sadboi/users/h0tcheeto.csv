Lime crime wet cherry glosses! I have these in quite a few colours and le shades. They are sparkly they a array of colours, and go fairly nice with unconventional makeup, there’s one that shines black glitter, and one that shines lime and they’re pretty cool. 

Essence kiss the frog / black sheep / mermaid lip balms, theses are ph lip balms and aren’t even 3 bucks I love them 

Ysl  intense matte stain in 11. I got this new off of a fb group for 5 dollars I couldn’t afford it if not lmao. I’m not a nude liquid lipstick person, but this ones my go too nude. 

Mac x Ariana grand viva glam glosses. These are my favourite Mac glosses they’re super pretty and flattering on me. I bought them before I went vegan years ago these are my favourite gloss shades so I can’t get rid of them. 

Too faced tutti frutti lip glase!! I hate metallic lipsticks but these are great and have a array of colours holds reds nudes, and the cute new watermelon ones, the nudes without to much glitter are flattering, and plump looking. The glittery ones I can dab off on my lips if I don’t want a blotted lip kinda thing, they’res also a great Metallic blue. 

My favourite lip products are 

Fenty beauty gloss bombs, I have the set and always forget to wear them lmao. These are a lot like wet cherry 

Lime crime liquid lips have the best nude shades!!!! I like my ysl better to even though I can only afford one. 

Sugar : tinted balms I love these, I can only afford them as samples tho! I do really like them. 

Pat McGrath balms : same goes for the sugar one!!! 

Last is js* velour liquid lip. He has a good arrange of colours and I have the blue lip bundle and love it."

makeupflatlays,f6nnp89,t1_f6netw8,1572995622.0,"I love her value sets / items because they actually have good value, as I could never afford her regular priced products lmaooo, and they’re more mid range - high end then luxury prices."
muacjdiscussion,f6nn8sf,t1_f6mvf2v,1572995312.0,"I like etude house, and tonymoly, you can get them anywhere that sells k beauty or even amazon :) essence also has some water tints."
Botchedsurgeries,f6mkuy9,t1_f6ld325,1572974588.0,"She has a friend, that also got famous with her sahar I think, and she’s beyond botched, it’s so sad, I thought she was so pretty and now she just looks creepy."
muacjdiscussion,f6mjtbl,t3_drxtbx,1572974156.0,"Lip tints, of all kind lol 
I like lip oils, ph lip balms / lipsticks. Tinted lip balms, and those water tints you can get from k beauty brands. 

I like how liquid to matte looks until I wear it for then 3 days straight and my lips are dry and cracking."
makeupflatlays,f6kv71x,t1_f6k4afr,1572921516.0,"You have to use your fingers to rub it in or it won’t completely change colours and it look look kinda ashy, it’s really cute if you dab it on otherwise! I’d recommend it, it’s a nice vampy blush just sorta hard to use."
makeupflatlays,f6jye7i,t1_f6jpb3k,1572902097.0,They’re so good. They have a black with glitter called shady witch I bought this one last year and used the whole thing now I have another :)

insaneparents,f6jg5ch,t3_dr9gbq,1572894200.0,"My mom screams at me if her phone isn’t connected to blue tooth her in her car, she screams at me if she drops something if I’m in the same room, she yells at me if she can’t find a adress, one I went for a walk and I came back and she set the oven on fire and she yelled at me for that too"

illnessfakers,f6fyo44,t1_f6emqhf,1572819687.0,"Yeah, I don’t think that’s fair. I don’t think anyone needs a stamp on they’re profile. I think it’s okay to speak out about being abused/ and how drugs impact you as a child, but that’s not the way too do it, it might be true, but she’s lied so much so I don’t know. I wonder how many people are sharing this, because it makes me kinda sad."
muacjdiscussion,f6brcds,t3_dqro96,1572777376.0,"I find a lot at winners, I think it’s because they don’t sell good as nudes. I always see urban decay / kat von d / too faced in bright colours 

Wet n wild has some cute ones if you wanna get the fantasy makers while it’s on clearance! 

Also bite beauty lipsticks are half of and they have a great range of colours

Essence has some a big range of lip products and most have bold colours they’re all under 4 dollars each too."

jeffreestarcosmetics,f64n0m6,t3_dqihqy,1572693991.0,"I bought it because I’m on a no buy since I moved out, and I thought I deserved a new palette, to play around with. I have mixed feelings, about it but I loved lots of the shade names, like ranch, cry on my couch, my pills, Cheeto dust, flaming hot, Diet Coke. My boyfriend made a joke about how it was a palette for me instead. I do like the first and last row, I think they’re good smoky / nude colours, I’m not sure about the middle row, I don’t like them all together, but I do wear lots of red / orange eyeshadow, so I might like them without the chanteuse / yellow / Trish shade mixed in. I like how beautylish has there swatches it’s a break down of each row. I wasn’t sure / and am not sure if I’m in love with it I do really like some of it, but the weird colour story might be fun to play with, I hope I like it when it arrives. It’s good how it has nudes / a black / a white, bold and bright shimmers, it might be a good versatile pallette it just looks a little weird"
swatchitforme,f63pt12,t1_f63okoy,1572681438.0,"Oh dammm, I wanted to get the mini over the full sized, but I thought the full sized was more practical because I couldn’t spend 20 converted to cad for it to ship, so I just got the big one and I got free shipping / pre paid duties on beautylish. 
I just like the colours in it more but I do have blue blood, and I might be able to dupe some shades, I just like the blue / burgundy colour story and the shade name cry on my couch. The large one has some very cool toned / and some black and grey shades, I really liked that because I wanted the Venus immortals and couldn’t justify spending full price on it."
muacjdiscussion,f63p2m8,t3_dqe7i6,1572681099.0,"J* jawbreaker perfect rainbow palette that has some interesting tones in them too, but that doesn’t make it uncohesive, I reach for nude eyeshadow maybe a quarter or less out of the times I do my makeup so I usually have something bright on the eyes and this is perfect for me"
swatchitforme,f63ojc7,t3_dq9f74,1572680843.0,What one do you like better?
autism,f63g9tp,t3_dqfbhn,1572676833.0,I left mine at my sisters and she’s avoiding giving mine back I’m so sad 😭
