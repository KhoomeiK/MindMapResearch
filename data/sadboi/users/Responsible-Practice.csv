BPD,fbdjqtb,t3_ecezdi,1576764144.0,I see someone. He is a small guy wearing a golden mask and rope.He comes very often to meet me and he tortures me a lot. He will really push me to react and keep telling me look that person doesn't want you around and that is why he is doing it(even if it's a small matter) . If I try  to ignore whatever he is telling me he sets me on fire or hits my head and it really hurts. I don't know if it's the same thing but this is what happens to me.
