The only thing is, I don't think crying is an inherent form of abuse though - such a grey area. Since I was a child, tears just come, even when I tried to stop them. 

So, if they were to come because something is happening that I don't want,  I don't think that could be considered abusive (in my case). This is not to say I'm not guilty of being abusive in other ways, I'm just trying to sort through this particular example. 

I've never switched on tears to get a result, but tears come so easily that people on the receiving end are often confused. Sometimes I ask them to please ignore my tears and continue talking; I can't control or get rid of them. The frustration of crying can make me cry even more.

I am sure there are some out there, but be prepared for the small pool you will be drawing from.  For most men (all I can speak directly about) a relationship is an investment of emotions, caring and effort.  Sex, and both physical excitement/pleasure and feelings of attachment, are

I feel I have to add, that considering I *told* him all this from the outset - that I do NOT have a high libido, that I would *prefer* not to see anyone, that if he wants to be around me so much then he should just be friends - there's never been any letting up. He maintains that a relationship *is* friendship.

Telling me i need therapy is a moot point. Telling me that I am unnatural is just downright messed up of you. I have received criticism here, but your levels of condescension are what make me want to reply.

You seem to be projecting your own situation onto me. You and I have done the same thing: created a Reddit account to explore some issues in our own lives. Just because you've had your entitlement to sex go unquestioned until your fifties, doesn't mean that everyone else prioritises the same needs. Some MEN also don't want sex, would you dare to believe. I'm in a situation that I understand would be hard to imagine, so I definitely would expect an empathy-poor stranger to not understand how this would happen.

It seems like deep down, you're afraid the reason your own wife doesn't want to have sex with you any more are for the reasons *I've* outlined, and therefore you are misdirecting your frustration at me. I do not represent all women, I am one woman. OBVIOUSLY there are personal problems. I am making myself vulnerable enough to explore them.

I would advise you seek help yourself, and you figure out why she doesn't want to anymore, instead of preaching from your high horse about how ""unnatural"" I am. Bring *her* to a damn therapist. It's not my fault your wife doesn't want to sleep with you any more. I'm sorry it's happening to you to, but maybe she saw it as a service she had to complete since you seem to be such militant about it - and feels her tenure is complete. 

I won't go into what kind of man I think you are for judging me and then thinking about you're going to leave a 20+ year marriage because her libido has changed... going as far as to ""**plot an ultimatum and divorce',** because of a reduction in sex. I at least know the status of my relationship, and consider it as much unfair to him as it is to me, despite the fact that he's pushed me. You on the other hand think that an *ultimatum* is a healthy tool. Your poor wife. As though bond, affection, care, trust, history means nothing. Seems I DO know what a caring relationship is about, and YOU should NOT be the one to question that. The difference between you and some others, is that sex simply falls in another place on that list. So maybe fix your own stuff, before jumping down my throat about my life. I've come for *constructive* opinions, not destructive ones, and I will defend my right to that."

Really? Yes, it can stain... and i think his smoking was quite heavy. 

I'll probably need to edit above, that the initial physical descriptions are very much related to what my mind reverts back to if he gets upset that we don't have sex for a couple of days. I think ""i had to get past all of that, and now I have to have demands placed on me to open up for service"". 

If things work out on certain days, I can enjoy it with him. Most times I don't think of him described above and I've somehow adapted. But those moments dredge up those feelings for me and I struggle reconcile them, which is why I just felt compelled to lead with those memories.

But I really can't stand the mess from sex though. I have no problem with the concept of it, but the feelings and the general sex smells are just not for me. I don't know what happened with me for me to feel like this. Someone above did mention sensory processing issues and that could be it. I remember my mum being grossed out watching people kiss on television if she could see a saliva exchange, so i don't know if there's some link there with how she is. I've looked into asexuality, but I'm not sure if that's fully me either. I guess I get what they mean now when they say sexuality exists on a spectrum."
deadbedroom,fpkebly,t1_fpk8r50,1588693127.0,"Thanks for your recommendations. As mentioned, I'm already pursuing this. Also as already mentioned, I'm clearly having difficulty making head or tail of it. Even if I can't clearly define the full extent of my complicity, nowhere do I doubt or have I ever suggested I'm in denial that it exists. So for **now**, my best bet is sharing exactly what I experience from my perspective. 

Since I have had therapists in the past, and an hour has never been long enough a week to manage this, part of that *specific* set of exercises you're prescribing are things I've already tried. The POSTS are for the purpose of showing to a professional. I find it difficult to fully organise my thoughts. Diaries don't work either. But anonymous human interaction seems to be helping me to organise my thoughts, so I'll continue on until I am able to bring it to the attention of a professional. I've wasted time and money in there going over suggestions that have already been made without a fully understanding of things and I feel this information would be easier access for them. Easy to read prior to consultation. And if not, easy for me to select and categorise things I need to present to a professional. So excuse me for sharing with you. You can hop off if you find it personally offensive. 

At no point have I ever suggested that I have nothing to do with what's happened to my life. What I *am* doing, is exploring every angle to figure that out. I'm already practicing DBT. I already am aware that I need to reframe my perspective and am looking into professional treatments that take a schematic approach. But whether  you're taking into consideration that therapy is even logistically an immediate possibility for me is another thing. 

This is a part of my exploration into this. I am for the most part accepting my role in it by ACCEPTING that this is what my life looks like right now. And I am ALSO taking actions to change what I can. I can't go backwards can I? My only issue is that I'm struggling because my *mind* often does. 

Whether you believe it to be a cop out or not, it's what happened. 
I was exhausted then for sure, and i definitely did not have the same level of drive to protect my life at that point AT ALL. I was suicidal at the time he pressured me. Self-responsibility was GREATLY reduced - all my plans i considered to be short-term, which contributes to why I was able to find temporary peace in giving in.  So you can throw that at me all you like to make me feel more like shit, it's not like I'm going to disagree with it. 

But I'm here talking about it frankly, and doing LESS harm by talking about it with a bunch of strangers than I would if I spoke to people who cared about me and I didn't have my shit together yet. I may not be as strong as you or act as rationally as you under stressors,  stranger. Doesn't mean that there's not a legit problem, or that he isn't OR I am not accountable.

As for my previous relationship, you have no insight into it, so you're **definitely** speculating at this point, and it's pretty unfounded."
deadbedroom,fpk6788,t1_fpiyzz4,1588688770.0,"I remember I thought his ex girlfriend was very attractive. I reached out to her if she experienced this, once. She said she had, and that it's very hard to get out. She also told me she felt only she could understand what this was like. 

I don't think you are far off in what you say. He did say to me once very early on, that he feels 'seen' when he's with me. I remember that bothering me, and I told him he shouldn't rely on another person to make himself feel whole or happy. 

When I rejected him all those times in the beginning, it was solely for the purpose of stopping him from pursuing me. I didn't expect us to end up in a situation, with that kind of history underneath us. I would definitely think he feels insecure, and i definitely think my contribution is that I feel confident that there wouldn't be infidelity, but I don't think im constantly consciously thinking about that either. I didn't want a partner, yes, but with that I was not yet built to deal with the emotional distress that comes with infidelity and all the other relationship related things. So in a round-about way, this is something I would naturally hedge against, whether in or out of a relationship. 

These insecurities of his in a way led me to not want to even look at other men in the eye much. I barely engage, keep things neutral, even though I'm supposed to foster these networks for my work. I couldn't deal with the turmoil from the arguments that would arise from jealousy. So my short-term answer ended up being phasing out certain ways I interact with people. I think this is something I'm prone to anyway. I lose a bit of myself if someone else is uncomfortable with something about me. 


>He will need vigilant nurturing of his feelings if you decide to make a life with this man. If you decide to walk, he will be very sad, but he will probably be ok.


Very insightful. 

As for how I describe him, even the nature of my initial post makes me quite sad. I can't tell if it's the actual situation or the BPD that paints things in this negative light. Looking at what I'm writing about him - I'm so glad that this is anonymous. These are the thoughts in my head and my memories of the beginning with things. How can I truthfully talk to people around me? Especially if he narratively sounds like he oscillates between serial killer and unrequited lover. 

I just came across this [video](https://www.facebook.com/CollegeHumor/videos/1361073094084915/?d=null&vh=e) which really accurately depicts how hard it is for me to see this objectively. It's a perfect representation, which is why I had to reply as soon as I saw it."

It's so frustrated and narrow minded. It's something I was starting to notice in a few people before, but now this pamdemic has happened it's just in my face everywhere I look! It's terrifying to me. I'm really trying to teach myself that it's out of my control and radically accept it, or I will go insane.

I have a pretty extroverted friend who is struggling hard right now. Her flatmate barely talk to her and holes up in his room. They went three days next door to each other's bedrooms without talking. She needs contact, her mental health is unusually suffering. I'm more like him, so I understand. (I'm hoping he's alright, but she tells me he keeps telling her he's fine). But I try to override that as best I can. I'm shit at it, and glad she has many friends, but I do want to do a little bit to contribute to helping her through this. Just like she helped me when the world was normal and things were more the other way around. We empathise with each other - even if I'm struggling to reach out to people because of how I am.  

It's the ones who normally tell us to suck it up that are behaving this way. Tells me so much about what fuels the common mental illnesses to do with social anxiety and depression. That's people worried about more than themselves. The ones you described are the types to shit on mental illness and have no patience or understanding, because it ""doesn't affect them"". 

This topic is happening online, in this house, we're all so divided. I know that everyone, including me, has a natural drive to look after ourselves first, but I didnt realise how far and deep that drive goes in some people. As in, their optimum comfort levels somehow trump the lives of others. There's zero visualisation. This society is so fractured... and I bring myself into question too: I know everyone has different views, but what seems so fundamentally common-sense it turns out is actually debatable and opposable. This stuff really just makes my brain cave in, I'm beginning to spiral out, I don't understand this planet at all. I know life is supposed to be hard, but no one told me it's hard because of... us?

deadbedroom,fphavvo,t1_fpgf4tk,1588618016.0,"I've tried to write about my situation before, and each time it gets abandoned, because there's so many tangential details. It ends up being SO long. I really appreciate your questions, because it allows me to get to some nuances that would have been too lengthy to disclose.

I have found that when I try to write to address one thing about him, he looks all bad. When I try to address another thing he looks like an angel. Our past is ugly. But when you look at the sum total of our current situation, it's like things are split down the middle. I have also never done so much introspection as I have during my time with him, and that's saying something because it is already a part of my personality.

**The probable reasons it has lasted so long:**

\- We had a honeymoon period, which is the time near the beginning after I told him I would try. I suspected that my resistance was skewing everything, and that if I gave it a clear shot maybe I would be surprised. He did seem to be trying to prove how good he would be for me. I was also starting to feel quite superficial for my reasoning, that he wasn't ""attractive enough"" for me. Who the hell did I think *I* was kind of thing (lol).

\- Besides his initial obvious control issues and personal space issues, which I have made him very aware of and have lessened hugely and in a long-term way, the way he treats me on a day-to-day basis has always been full of kindness, softness, and an attentiveness that I've not experienced before. If it's love bombing, it's *very* consistent. He's never said an unkind word to me, which is why I feel like such a monster. If I say something that wounds him, I can see the hurt, but he will still continue to ask me if I need anything.

\- Because he is so aware of his own flaws now, he often comes to me to work through his communication skills with other people, and his thoughts. A lot of people speak with me about these kinds of things, and I'm usually the advice-giver. So my situation is very ironic - anyone who knows about this is really super shocked about it all. So I've had to be careful in who I tell, because there *is* this back and forth nature to our relationship - and I seriously don't want to exhaust people or cry wolf if I find it challenging to follow through.

\- I've never felt lonely before, and this has never been a driving factor for me. I cherish my alone time. But he has now become a part of my alone time, which means that when I am *actually* alone, I can no longer appreciate it or cope so well. I broke up with him once before and cut off all ties. I barely left my room, I was not functioning well at all. This sucked. I just didn't know how to live suddenly. I was without him for six months, until I had another job in Asia.

\- He has been very receptive to my autodidactic therapy research. He is desperate to break some of the behaviours he feels trapped by, and wants to see a professional both with me and alone, which is better to me than most people who just clash on these topics and have no intention on changing themselves. Prior to me, he had no understanding of these topics like we do in the West. But his attitude towards it all matches me in a way. My last serious partner, who I would say was like my best friend, was very supportive about my DBT work, but it seemed impossible for him to be objective, or to compromise with me on a lot of things. The stark differences between this relationship and that with regard to personal growth are what make me feel this way I suppose.

\- Like I mentioned before I already have my own personal aversions to sex. But compared to anyone else, it definitely has been the best with him. All those things that disgusted me in the past either no longer really are a big thing, or I've gotten used to it? Not sure. It's weird, because despite how my description sounds, he's a very clean person, which I really appreciate. I'd have to go into detail for this to work out in the reader's mind, so I'll leave it at that for now.

**Why leaving is not an easy immediate decision**

\- My job has been pretty tied up with his up until lately. I'm actually in his home country right now, under the lockdown with him. I tend to go back and forth between here and the UK, and the last time I left him, I managed to leave him behind in this country. I had a job which brought me back to the region, (SE Asia) and he got wind of this and began to visit me. That's how I'm back in the situation. As you can tell, there have been a few cultural differences in our values. I put down a lot of his boundary issues and control issues to what he's learned culturally. Most of these things he shows he doesn't value much, and expresses to me often that it's all he's known. Once his perspective widens on certain topics, it's like he adapts to them. This willingness to be open to my cultural values and to reevaluate his own is probably also what led me to continue to stay. It was probably a leeway thing, but it does cover the initial attitudes to personal space, control, etc.

Where he screws up is where his insecurities are triggered and he goes into panic mode: is she going to leave me, does she not like how I am in the bedroom, I can't cope with not fixing this *right now*.

\- Previously, I didn't really have much of my own network, and the bare finances I made, were tied up in his, because he is the local one. The nature of my work doesn't give a clear expat status, which means my debit card is under his name. We were broke a lot of the time due to his initial poor money management (he wanted to spend on me and other people, and didn't have the means to. I had to fight to split costs on most things) and other issues (having to send back most of my money for my late mother's house running costs in London), and so when I went back to London that last time, I worked on financially untying myself from him, which is how things are to this day. He's totally adapted to this, recognised that it's beneficial and I've organised things so money is no longer an argument. It means that he maintains the same level of spending and recognises that if he has trouble I might be able to help him (the same as he would me if he had the means) rather than we both have nothing at the same time. Things are far more relaxed in that respect, because there's no pressure to support me, which is not what I want. It's these small wins and attitude toward change that have contributed to my staying so far I think.

\- I left just before the quarantine, and he just kept finding reasons to get in touch etc. I have friends for support, but they also find the situation very difficult and very complicated. My most black and white friend, the friend who thinks only in binary and thinks all problems are easier than people make them out to be has lived with us while here, and has concluded that I am in an impossible situation. He just silently supports me, and is astonishingly understanding - and maintains that I've been showing impossible strength.

I definitely would expect that from time to time people in relationships people are not going to be dtf at the same time always, so thank you for that comment too. Even the situation that led me to finally post was SO mild. It's just coloured by a really shitty background. This time, *all he did* was ask me why I didn't want to have sex. It was very gentle, even though it clearly affected him massively (the last two nights I haven't wanted to either, so it's beginning to build for him, which makes me feel more pressured only as a by-product. He's not complaining, not sulking - if anything, my mood changed because he asked me the question. The question itself is fine, it's just loaded with history.

Sorry to be so lengthy about it, but I liked that your comments asked for more context. It helped me to relax more in my current situation, where there's physically nothing I can do. When I came back from London last time, I told him I would only move forward if we got help to establish boundaries. Life has since happened, but I'm still looking into it, and I'm very much on board with what you're saying.

Edit:

Also about the violence, you are completely right and it's something that gets me really down, but I am working on it hard. I have so much sympathy for the myriad men who don't discuss these things and for the fact that women seldom get blamed. It's even difficult to avoid the cliches ""look at what you made me do"" and ""I didn't want to do this"". So I really understand how people get there. I have a huge insight into how *anyone* can really screw up a whole lifetime with one move, so I also take the super-righteous advice with a pinch of salt - especially if it hasn't much context. I often am very blunt about it in my language, and say to him directly - at this point you *were* in danger, you need to recognise this is an abusive situation, etc.

It's like he thinks I can do no harm somehow, so it's quite hard to work against that and to not absorb it as the truth. I have harmed him, and he forgives me immediately, which in a way totally sucks.

The violence thing is **never** ok.

On one hand I hear so much that people put up with historically in relationships, and i think - maybe I shouldn't be phased - maybe it's normal. People fight and deal with each other and grow and get out of phases. 

But one thing that's different is there's so many people I look at, so many stories I hear, and the most common foundation is this feeling of attraction and togetherness. Whilst I've found some attraction in him, I truly had to go searching. Like I had to work for it within the situation. I see so much love in a lot of couples' eyes. But I don't really respond when he tells me he loves me. And I'm not proud to show off - we barely have any pictures together. 

I've felt healthier lately, and that's tricking me. It's so hard because reading through these messages is making me think again, and he knows something's up. I feel like I'm going to trigger his asking me a lot of questions about what's wrong with me, which always potentially leads to some argument. But we're stuck here during the quarantine, there's no where for me to leave to. The only way to get out without issue is to play it cool for a while, and that's kind of the way it's always been, until something else comes up."

My mum was like this too. 

For these reasons I have been avoiding having children, although I adore them. Most people around me insist I would be very good with them, but I can see the amount of crap I would pass down. I **need** to fix me, and I am working toward this. I am beginning to explore schema therapy and reparenting therapy, for more tools on how to alter the BPD framework I use to view the world."
deadbedroom,fpgbvhm,t1_fpg6734,1588599424.0,"Reading the first part my heart sank initially, because of what BPD seems to represent. Most people who begin that way seem to have had a rough time. 

But I think I would say, if any of my exes were to report back on me, I think he has definitely experienced the worst of this thing I have. I've never been in any relationship like this before, it's a total anomaly. 

But the thing is, I do try not to embody those traits as much as I can. I mean, I push him away often, but I don't actively seek him out, or beg him to stay - nothing of that sort. Which has led me to think - even if I'm not outwardly doing this, am I doing something which signifies the opposite? I'm confused because bluntness I've needed to employ to push him away, has in it's own way turned into what resembles a symptom of my disorder. 

Thank you for acknowledging this. I really do want to be not associated with it. It was my most important thing to not be involved with a guy so I could spend time with my mother and work on myself. So it stumps me that someone would Robocop their way through rejection like he did, not choose to dump me for ""acting out"" and still maintain that I improve every facet of his life (which is impossible).

Yes, you're right. I've said this to him before. Before me and after me will be the same - I keep telling him to get help so the next person doesn't end up in my situation. 

Sometimes when I don't feel like it, I don't communicate properly at all. Like when I say no, it's quiet. There have been a couple of times, where he's just ignored my pushing his hand away, and will keep going. I don't have the energy to forcibly say it anymore, so he ends up just removing stuff and entering. He'll literally be *in* me, and then he will notice that I'm just lying there and not engaging, waiting for it to be over. Then he says, ""oh, are you not ok?"" 

The last time he did this I looked him dead in the eye and said - ""well you're basically raping me, so no"". Then it turns into a whole new thing - and I rage at him even more. The last time, he comes with ""I didn't know that could happen if you're in a relationship"" - I couldn't believe his ignorance, feigned or not. I got worse with every thing he said. ""I said, if I said no, and if I push you away from me, it indicates **I don't want sex, so stop trying**"". He truly doesn't see what's wrong, and then I get mad for having to break it down until he finally understands it. 

The ""breakthrough"" we had the other day was when he admitted that when I talk to him under these circumstances, he just switches off and doesn't absorb what I'm saying - because he feels like he's being attacked. He said this because one time, when I threw him out of a hotel room I was staying in (a work trip he followed me on) I printed off a psychology article about emotional hostages, highlighted everything that applied to my situation, and wrote footnotes about what the examples were that I had in mind. He said that he was devastated, didn't know that this is what I was trying to tell him this whole time, and said this was a good way to provide him with information because in those moments when I'm trying to tell him, he just shuts down and can't hear me any more (the lack of understanding is what usually led to me screaming). 

He's tried a few times to convince me to film ourselves during sex, but I can't ever agree to that mainly because my job potentially is high profile, visibility-wise. Footage of that nature would ruin me, so while I don't condemn the idea at all, I can't risk it. Let alone the fact that he's him. 

So you're right about the sexual fantasy thing."

>You can’t allow the quicksand of comfort to suck you in just because you tolerate him sometimes

Really resonates with that part of things. I even like him sometimes, feel empathy for him, console him over his social anxiety, work together with him at home. And he's not lazy or anything at all - every morning during this pandemic he's brought me vitamin C and a cup of coffee. He'll cook, do laundry, take care of the dog. If I'm down and start to neglect my side of any of these things, he'll just handle it until I feel able again.

Yes, this is exactly what happened when I left him twice. I cut off all contact. He'd get alternative numbers to reach me on. Had friends back me up. I have become a far weaker version of myself who now can't deal with a person not being by my side. I began this as a fiercely independent, non-needy person. Being in this, I am astonished at how those characteristics can be stolen from a person, so much that it's impossible to do what seems easy and straightforward in writing.

There is ""love"" there now, because in all of this, I have had to find ways to enjoy my life, and more often than not, this has involved him. So what I am dealing with is enmeshment, a kind of self-aware Stockholm syndrome and love borne out of familiarity.

I did get away how you suggested. It was impossible to stick it out, and he found me, anomy brain just wasn't strong enough any more. It's so much more impossible, with these connections with my mother etc. I did all of the above. This is so much harder than theory.

Even if the brain wants to die, the body will reflexively try to save itself, so there's that: 

The brain can't take the emotional pain, so overrides the will to live. 
The body uses physical pain as a way to kick itself into survival mode. 

If people can't see that it's this catch 22 that keeps us on the brink if death, they are blind fucks. 



In addition to this, I had to bargain with/ trick myself into living, for the sake of other people. 

- I put off dying to spare my best friend (her old best friend from her home country killed herself also). 
- I told myself I could die after x achievement. 
- I then started telling myself I could die if I found somewhere no friends or family would find me, and where I could be easily accessed by professionals who might be less traumatised than the average person (I quit a part time job because I knew I was getting closer and closer to jumping on the train tracks en route to work). 
- I told myself I could die after my mum dies (she had cancer and I felt like my suicide would expedite her death, and I knew she wanted to be alive). 
- I told myself I could die after i legally protected her estate from her narcissist sister.

I've been on Reddit looking for somewhere where this is mentioned. I identify highly. I also have BPD, so I don't know if this is a thing. 

So as far as I can understand within myself, it has to do with shame. 

I go through short periods of being functional, feeling well, like I'm able to cope, but I have a really low-set baseline. I'm often suicidal. So I've found that when I feel like this, the moment I speak to someone, they will notice, and it will cause them to be overly concerned about me. I also can't pretend to have the same energy or positive mood that they might have caught me in a short while ago - I know the difference would huge and confusing, and that I wouldn't be able to simply explain it away. 

I feel like a lot of people don't have time for these neuroses of mine - they have their own problems - and those that do feel helpless if the solution they offer doesn't change anything. So to avoid all of that, I end up not speaking to them. Or picking up their calls. They argue that at least if they speak to me, they'll know I'm ok. But I'm NOT ok. I CANNOT reassure people that I am ok when I am suicidal. I can't tell them that. And for them to take the conclusion that I am if we DO end up speaking **infuriates** me and adds to the despair. So it doesn't make sense to me. They also cannot make me any better. 

I always felt it's like a futile wish that the world could slow down or  stop for a while. In a weird way for everyone else, this Corona Virus is just like that for them - the world *has* stopped, but for me - I feel more exposed. All the people who would just go on living their lives if I disappear, notice even more that I've disappeared in a way. Or it feels like my non-responsiveness just is somehow amplified, because most people are at home, near their devices and available, and they expect me to be also. 

I have a close friend who has grown up showing me a lot of patience with this. But she has grown older, and through the things she has had to deal with (things which have been challenging, but given her potential for growth) she has become a lot more stoic and no-nonsense in her attitude and I can see that patience running out. If we do have a conversation, it tends to be peppered with small passive aggressive allusions to these values. Like the other day, she was talking about how she's worried that this self-care generation doesn't show enough grit. Ie me. I am aware that our relationship has a fundamental basis which expects me to be flaky and unavailable, not reliable etc., and I know that she doesn't have a tendency to cut people out her life easily. So in a way it feels like she remains my friend out of duty rather than anything - relationships for her are something she's good at. 

It's definitely the hardest part of this whole thing. Facing these people will lead, in the long-run, to personal growth. 

But it feels impossible. Absolutely impossible. Especially by the fact that if I do expose myself to others while I'm in this state, I've observed that I leave destruction in my wake (via self-sabotage).
I think most people's assumption is that I am being weak, need to pull myself together and figure out how to get on with it. Maybe they're right. I try to think in terms of ""just getting on with it"". But literally, I feel myself spending most of my energy trying to fight off death every day. I find more exposure makes that worse. I can't cope with feeling this much. I am filled with rage these days which, if I am around people, will actually isolate me anyway, so I suppose I'm doing it first: I guess I'm avoiding abandonment too, although I've never looked at it this way. 

I recently sent a grovelling WhatsApp to my friend the other day, because I made plans to come see her and her new baby. He's already one and a half I think? I failed so bad, yet find it impossible to explain to people why. The thought of constantly using this as an excuse is the worst. And yet when I have moments of feeling ok, i promise myself I'm never going to do it again, and i make every effort to practice healthy behaviours that will prevent it, such as creating a light schedule which involves rewarding myself for reaching out to one person a day, exercise, meditation and sleep. But it makes it worse when I fall again, and I'm now starting to fear feeling ok. 

At least by seeing posts like yours I can share with you this feeling. It's hell. Yesterday my partner's mother overheard us having a small argument and she knocked on the door and asked him angrily,  ""why is SHE angry now?"" The she stood at the entrance, faced me and said we shouldn't live together because I get so angry. I **already** knew this about myself. I **already** wanted to work on it myself without dragging anyone into my emotional state. I never wanted to burden anyone with my life, and I couldn't manage the possibility of having to fill other's emotional cups when mine is empty, but he pushed and pushed until I was worn down. Now she has seen my ugly and rejected me for it - a key fear I have come to life. So now I feel rejected, for being exposed to people I tried my hardest not to expose myself to. I feel like a monster, and can imagine the way they view me. I'm actually in a country that's not my home, it's his. And I can't go anywhere. 

So even though i didn't want to inflict it on anyone, I have. Now I'm stuck with them all in the middle of coronavirus, on lockdown in a different country, and I can barely open the door and show my face. I wait until she's asleep before coming to the kitchen. I just want to be invisible and not get in anyone's way."

I would need to see that I can manage my feelings around the people who trigger me the most, because that's what children can do sometimes. 

Nine months wouldn't be enough for me to train myself. 

I don't know if I'll ever be ready to have kids, I put them off because I thought I'd be an unfit parent. But with this idea, of doing this to fix myself before ineven consider having them - at least it gives me a chance to rebuild and become a better person before I taint them.

Mine seem to be complex and never ending though. I've written so many. So I've created this account which hopefully answer all questions once it's built. 

Rather than create a note, I figured an account that can properly show my inner workings on different subjects will answer more questions than one essay. I'll give family and friends the passwords for it."

Sorry to hear what you went through. In other news I randomly came across info for the first time about OCD in this regard. Many people who have these intrusive thoughts worry that they are paedo, but actually it doesn't count here. It's like the fact that the thoughts push through constitute as *intrusive* means that you don't want them and find they negatively affect your life, as opposed to people who at the minimum fantasies about these things."

Hermit,fobjuu9,t1_fob4uws,1587660555.0,"Well, you've proved to me that your reading comprehension is not much to write home about. Maybe would be if what I wrote supported your completely unfounded and clearly ignorant accusations of me. 

What you've written above is far from how it went, so you fail basic reading on that part. 

To summarise:

- Found a subreddit *prior* to your ""advice"". 
- Coincidentally found something useful, which triggered something I meant to look up anyway. 
- Involved Google for the rest of it. 

So funny that because even though it *already* went this way, you suggest I'm not cognitively able to do a google search... you're acting as though due to the way things worked out for me in this instance, somehow I do not know how to ""internet"". ""Magic""? Ha. 

Considering that this particular time is the *first* time I've done it this way, I don't know why you're taking such trouble to feign concern. 
Clearly you wanted this to process to go your way. 

**Do you want me to go and *unask* for this link?** is that what you think would be success in this situation? 

You honestly do not give a shit about the person you are pretending to *help*, since you are you taking the time to criticize ONE particular way I came across some information. You can't seem to get it into your head that I could have *already* been speaking to professionals. You think that excludes me from everyone else and 
means I can't also look online? What kind of obtuse thinking is that? Never did I ONCE say I *relied* on social media for answers. 

It's idiotic to squeeze this much of a conclusion out of a simple request for another subreddit group. Surely you see this? Yeah, you do. I'll give you at least the minimum expectation for intelligent thought. 

Something truly displeased you about the fact that I've found something useful, and even though I have **verified** the source - using google no less - you think that just one drop of layman interaction has undone the entire integrity of what I have found. 

SoCiaL MeDiA iS ThE DeViL - says the redditor troll. 
I've worked extensively to identify professionals across the globe to create a network of experts who can provide market insights to financial investors - as a knowledge broker, dude. 

Helped to populate LinkedIn with this network. I've sat in on expert panels, and I know the quality of my network. It only follows that *in BEING one*, I know how to figure out how to *find* a professional. And nowhere in my original comment did I EXCLUDE this possibility. Sometimes it's also nice to just speak to people in a similar position,  you know this, or you wouldn't be on a freaking hermit subreddit, hypocrite. You argument is so weak and frail, it's totally transparent. I've proved none of your ""points"". 

Especially odd, since you have no idea who or what I have found on this occasion, or what professional I have within my network to cross check my findings with. So many gaps in your knowledge of the context, that what you claim to be ""concern"" is clearly identifiable as trolling. Just because you don't know how to think outside the box, doesn't mean I don't. Your limitations are not everyone's limitations. 

I can see your intent is to insult and belittle, not to help - which is pathetic, since you are trying to target someone to clearly asked a question for help. In fact all I asked for was a subreddit - which you tried poorly to pathologize, you armchair psychologist, you. 

Going by your own logic, why would I follow anything *you* say?
Are you this holy grail professional I seek?

Your attack on a stranger asking for help is what is worrying. I'm glad you recognise you've wasted your own time. 

Enjoy your rigidity. 
I'm sure you'll heal the world with it."
