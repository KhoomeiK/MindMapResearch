GachaLifeCringe,fqez6un,t3_gibeyo,1589316034.0,"I honestly don’t understand why gay men are so heavily fetishized in the gacha community. I’m a lesbian myself, and you don’t see half of it as much as you do gay relationships. (Not that I’m complaining, I just don’t understand) it’s been the goal of the lgbtq+ community to be recognized as being normal. That our relationships are normal. But having all these top/bottom dynamics is honestly really toxic, not to mention it’s teaching young kids that this is acceptable and this is what a gay man is. Sure, some people enjoy cross dressing and such, but not everyone likes that. Yknow? Hope I made some sort of sense."

I think a lot of the issue is there is some people here, who don’t think they deserve to work. So they live off of welfare and disability that they don’t need. (A lot of people need disability- but I know a few people who are fine and got on it) I mean there’s literally videos of people saying they’re too good to work on YouTube. Same goes for the Uk. I’ve talked to some friends there, and they claim it’s pretty much the same issue."

This happened a lot with my aunt when she was going through her menopause, I don’t know how old your mom is or what- but I’m just trying to help you find a solution. 
I really hope this gets better, and I know it’s more of a personal suggestion and an odd one- women and hormones are weird. 

Anyways, I’m sorry if this came off as odd. If you ever need a stranger to vent too about random stuff, you can always pm me!"
ChoosingBeggars,eufhduj,t3_cg41vk,1563774465.0,"To be honest, this makes a bit of sense. 
I agree it is rude to attack a free gift, but perhaps a bit of an explanation?

I don’t know if this is a case, but there’s a few companies were people sign up to make cakes and baked goods for birthdays parties of kids who are in hospital/ poor. Usually requests are allowed; but most people doing this usually use marshmallow or chocolate fondant or whatever because they know kids won’t eat it. 

I think this person is being rude; it’s a free gift and she should accept it. But just something I thought about that may be interesting to a few!"

AskReddit,eqfz9pk,t3_by38k2,1560029342.0,"For a good chunk of my childhood, money was rough for my family. We were a four person family, living on what we could. 
Eventually my brother and I got too old to share a room, so I slept in the back entrance with the washer and dryer. 
I remember one time my aunt on my dads side was terminally ill, and her partner couldn’t take care of her. 
So they packed up their kids and moved them across the country. She lived on disability, having 2 kids, we moved out of our house and into my grandmothers basement. 
My dad picked up extra hours, and so did my mom. She worked night shift. 
This continued on for awhile, until they moved back.

Things got finically better for us, but Recently as we were driving home, my dad and I talking about his new job, and my future. he started telling me some things I knew, but didn’t know much about.

One of his coworkers is a crazy tumblr lady, she’s a white women who only believes my dad has gotten where he has (a very good management position) in the company because he’s a white man. 
And my dad told me a lot, trying to vent out his frustrations.
He had to work twice as hard as everyone else because he didn’t go to college. He told me he had to kiss up to so many people, he had to crawl for ever opportunity because if he missed a single one everything he built would come crashing down. 
Recently his health has really declined, but yet he still works 12pm-1am.
Only recently have I realized how much he does for me and my brother.
He works his ass of for us so we can do what we want to do and be happy. 
He’s always trying to push us to do what we want, and has never discouraged us. 
Everything he’s ever done in work has always been for his family.
I really love you dad, thank you."
