I am a psychology PhD student and am trying to recruit participants for an online study that I'm running. The overall ambition is to improve our psychological understanding of mental health conditions. The current study is an online questionnaire which looks at patterns in relationships, personality, mental health, and behaviour. It takes around 30 minutes to complete. Here is a link to further background info and study details: [https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0H7BSqcFv46NNad](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0H7BSqcFv46NNad).

It is best completed on a laptop/computer but can also be done on a mobile phone. 

Thanks a lot :)"

But a lot of people have been very helpful and keep to participate so it's looking like the data collection will hopefully be quite quick! Again, I'm not too sure about how long the analysis will take at the moment, possibly a few months. Either way, I am very happy to share the findings on here once they are complete.

**Background**: I am running this study as part of my PhD. But... I have worked very closely with people with mental health difficulties (in a mental health hospital), including people close to me, and I have the ambition of improving our understanding of mental health conditions and improving diagnosis and treatment procedures. This study is an online questionnaire which looks at patterns in relationships, personality, mental health, and behaviour.
