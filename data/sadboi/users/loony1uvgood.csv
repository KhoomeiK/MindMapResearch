bipolar2,fr2w1gk,t3_gkznb4,1589844999.0,I am a banker and so have to deal with customers. Most of the time I manage to suppress it. But still I come out as pretty rude. I always pinch myself hard to get rid of it. Or curse them six ways from Sunday in my mind.
bipolar2,fr2v8d2,t1_fr0rro6,1589844546.0,Same. But I can never manage poems. I tend to write quotes as such. Also I have larger depressive episodes.
bipolar2,fr0o7u0,t3_glyrgb,1589802222.0,What you are describing feels like very short depressive episodes. Staying in bed all day and feeling exhausted. Mine lasts for months. Some times weeks go by like this. You should bring it up with your psychiatrist.
bipolar2,fr0nzo0,t3_glozp7,1589802028.0,It's beautiful. I felt every line. Keep writing.
bipolar2,fqwgge8,t3_gl8ghh,1589703531.0,"I don't even remember from when I had suicidal thoughts. I was abused by a relative when I was 13. Maybe it started then. I remember having thoughts of killing him. I never told anyone about this. I don't know if it contributed or not to me later feeling suicidal. I got suicidal when I was 17 and tried to end my life. I tried again at 19. My family was distraught and I resolved to never act on it again as I fail. I got through college somehow did post graduation also. I got a job it was high stress. Started planning suicide again. Left job and wasted 1 year jobless and in bed. Got another job. Still couldn't handle stress. Went to psychiatrist on my own and got diagnosed as bipolar at 28. Didn't want to take meds to mess up my mind.  Later ended up 3 months on bed with severe depression and that's why my parents dragged me to psychiatrist again. This time took the meds. Finally for three months constant suicidal thoughts stopped. Even took up running for a month. 


It took me 10 years to acknowledge that something is wrong with me mentally. There are still times when I still doubt my diagnosis. Then I remember the past and make myself believe in diagnosis again. The meds have sorta stopped working though. I need to go see the doctor again. Also I know this would always be a constant struggle."
bipolar2,fqwfltj,t3_glbada,1589702669.0,I have had my share of this. I also suffer from recurrent sinus infection. Though most of the time I am rapid cycling. Sometimes get too depressed. I totally relate to feeling not headache the way you have described.
bipolar2,fqwfg1c,t3_glbkdk,1589702509.0,It's possible to be both depressed and hypomanic at the same time. You might be rapid cycling. At least that's what my psychiatrist told me when I felt like this. Hold on till Monday. I am a mess too and will be waiting for a week atleast for the meds. Know that you are not alone in feeling this way. Cope with whatever way you have learned to cope so far. If it gets too much get help. Nothing is more important than your life.
bipolar2,fqw6ywm,t3_gkh811,1589694637.0,Your dad's advice is same as my mom's. As much as I hate that advice it's the only way. I was off work due to quarantine for 15 days. The days blended together and I slept through most of the day and kept awake at night. Now I am back to work and managing to go somehow. First day was the hardest. The routine of work somehow has helped me. But after coming from work I turn into a potato and my room's a mess. I would suggest make someone accountable for your actions. As I am accountable at work I somehow gathered energy to go there. It's not perfect but It's better than what I did for 15 days. Also celebrate little wins. Just take a shower one day or eat something. Don't expect too much. You can go through it slowly and steadily.
bipolar2,fqw6h0s,t3_gkhog0,1589694229.0,I have had so many rebirths. But I always fall back on old patterns after a while. Weirdly I always resolve for the current meto die at night and imagine I will be born anew in morning.
bipolar2,fqw6d7e,t3_gkjyl9,1589694143.0,I feel that you are just irritable due to bipolar. I am the same way with my family. I live away from them. Some days I could talk to them on phone for hours. Some days even 5 minute conversation irritates me. Also when visiting them same thing happens. They are also pretty supportive. They were the ones who dragged me to psychiatrist for treatment. I have been living Just for them. I would suggest when you feel irritable remove yourself from them and keep minimum contact. Also tell them what you find irritating. They might feel hurt but they will understand that it's not you but the bipolar. Also bring up this irritability with your psychiatrist.
bipolar2,fqt323b,t3_gkdqnv,1589628303.0,Congrats! I am proud of you. Good job. It gives me hope too.
bipolar2,fqo4sf9,t3_gk024s,1589507558.0,I have missed too but a gap of day or two doesn't affect me that much. Haven't done it frequently though. Although I always remember to take sleeping pills as that would affect me if I miss one.
bipolar2,fqo4fx4,t1_fqnyubo,1589507360.0,I was scared of takeout due to Corona. But now doing just that. Better than missing meals.
bipolar2,fqgz13x,t1_fqgkwpf,1589362099.0,We need some study about its inheritability.
bipolar2,fqg1djz,t1_fqe41as,1589335911.0,I have been sedentary. Hate sugar though so at least I have that going for me.
bipolar2,fqceuyk,t1_fqbdnlt,1589256486.0,Yup I went back after a month. Thanks for your understanding.
bipolar2,fqcelxh,t1_fqbxfg0,1589256315.0,Thanks. It's really helpful that you put things in perspective. I will try to go easy on myself from now on.
bipolar2,fqb5o31,t3_geu8vm,1589231015.0,Wow. I felt that. Feels like something I wrote. It's okay to let it all out. I used to write stuff and then burn it. Just remember this is not you. It's just your illness speaking.
bipolar2,fqb571n,t1_fpseo9z,1589230778.0,Yup me too. My mother understands now what I go through. But she has this very positive view that all will work out at the end. Meanwhile I have gotten so far back from my peers professionally as I keep taking career breaks. Also she expects me to get married now. It feels like she is two different person sometimes. At least it's better than not believing that I have an illness. She was the one who dragged me to get help. But this pointless positivity feels like a burden.
bipolar2,fqb4bzx,t1_fqb3m89,1589230352.0,I chalked it all up to my major depressive episodes. But they grew quite frequent. I now feel like I have lost 10 years of my life. Sometimes I still feel like a teenager.
bipolar2,fqb36bw,t3_ghr1oq,1589229773.0,I talked here and now I can talk about some of the stuff to my mom. She is very understanding.
bipolar2,fqb2hic,t1_fq3s9d6,1589229429.0,I didn't know that it leads to cognitive decline if left untreated. I always feared that meds will lead to cognitive decline. I have finally taken the plunge and am now on meds. I would have started earlier if I knew about cognitive decline.
bipolar2,fqb1y13,t3_gheutx,1589229155.0,You are human. Don't judge yourself too harshly. He might forget it or he might not. My father is has very loving nature but he is Schizophrenic. He had violent episodes. He never beat me up but my other family members. I used to get really scared because in that episode he was still very caring towards me. So children do remember. I would suggest you take steps that it doesn't happen in future. Nothing is more important than safety of your child. Physically he might be ok but you can't check on his mental status. He might not remember and forget all about it. But do take precautions that this doesn't happen in future.
bipolar2,fqb0nhr,t3_gguks9,1589228521.0,This comforts me.
bipolar2,fqaxhbt,t3_ghv0gp,1589226968.0,"I am going through same thing from past two week. Had 2-3 ok days in between I guess. Try for little wins. Managing to shower, eating a meal, making the bed etc.
Also if you are on meds get second opinion from your psychiatrist. Talk to someone out loud if possible. If possible go to a therapist."
bipolar2,fqax1wt,t3_ghg4dh,1589226759.0,Hypomanic me forgets to eat and depressive me hates to eat. So I starve myself mostly.
bipolar2,fqawtxa,t1_fqacen1,1589226653.0,Beautiful analogy of Rose. Yes we are not broken. We tend to forget that.
bipolar2,fqawldp,t3_ghopzz,1589226540.0,Seems like Schizophrenia and bipolar has high correlation. My father has Schizophrenia and I have bipolar. Don't know much about its inheritance though. I always feared I would end up Schizophrenic.
bipolar2,fqavwb8,t1_fqamy6n,1589226198.0,True. Plus they hear without any preconceived notions.
depression,fq5zvf8,t3_gh1qdn,1589121502.0,I am sorry that it's back. It's back for me too. Talk to someone if you can. I am barely able to get out of bed. I have to go to office thrice a week and I am somehow managing.  I would suggest get a study partner and force yourself to go to a library if you can manage that. Also get help ASAP. Talk to your therapist or psychiatrist.
depression,fq5zgg0,t3_gh1rp8,1589121240.0,I am not always like this. But when I am in most depressive phases I would hate to see normal happiness.  Sometimes I would be apathetic. Don't fight it though. Do you always feel like this?
funny,fpnjbb4,t3_gefwwv,1588764761.0,Well it's how I normally roll. I have bipolar though.
bipolar2,fpkoipg,t1_fpkhztt,1588698298.0,Yup it sucks. I wish I had some control and could live normally.
bipolar2,fpkb11q,t1_fpk9p85,1588691388.0,Well my BP2 has been sorta under control through meds. So that's why I am noticing it now maybe.
bipolar2,fpk734j,t1_fpjxqqp,1588689254.0,Yeah! that's the dream.
bipolar2,fpjt12b,t1_fouor4b,1588680166.0,Lol
bipolar2,fpjsxd9,t3_ga1cbs,1588680082.0,Yes totally. I am super depressed right now. Can't get out of bed to feed myself level. I can't relate to person I was a month ago when I was waking up at proper time and going to the office. I feel like that was a dream or something.
bipolar2,fpjsrf2,t3_gafdgb,1588679951.0,Haha ... So true ðŸ˜‚
bipolar2,fpjn96h,t3_gc0ru3,1588674798.0,Wow great job. Send some energy to me too. I need it.
bipolar2,fpjmzu6,t1_fpjmjqo,1588674536.0,Thanks a lot. I hope I can do it.
bipolar2,fpjmp6n,t3_gdjy69,1588674238.0,It worked for me. I have IBS so I don't know if it made my stomach issues worse or not. I would have weird panic attack after taking it at night. Very worse case of akathisia when started but it became mild later on. I was scared to switch on any other medication. As it worked better than previous ones.
bipolar2,fpjm6ie,t3_gdo3jz,1588673710.0,I am but not willingly. It's due to Covid 19. It's not available for me right now. I am really messed up now. I hated taking them. Didn't know they were helping so much. I literally can't get up from my bed right now. Every simple thing is taking an effort.
bipolar2,fpjm1g0,t1_fpjlhpq,1588673567.0,Well I will get a consultation again when all this Covid stuff normalises a bit. But I feel even having an answer won't help much. The important part is having a routine. Having self control. I am failing miserably. There's no meds for that.
bipolar2,fpjlvbb,t1_fpj61jn,1588673394.0,Yup good advice there. Seriously Covid -19 has messed us up further. I always wanted a pet but I am scared as I barely manage myself. Taking on such a responsibility is good. Hope you get back up on your feet.
bipolar2,fpjlnyb,t1_fpiiyln,1588673177.0,Yup got to know about that episode here. It's really good. Better than other portrayals. Trying to hold on to a job amidst this mess. Although I gave up on dating long time ago. Never really started really. The only nitpicking I have with episode is that I am in the middle of it. I mean I can never feel it coming in. I would be super depressed and realise that I have been so for a week. Even when I am rapid cycling would realise it later.
bipolar2,fpjlf75,t3_gdtpds,1588672919.0,Seriously what's up with that. I can't keep missing work.
bipolar2,fpjle2e,t1_fphxrsf,1588672885.0,I was same way with meds. But when I accepted it they made my life a bit better.
bipolar2,fpjla2b,t1_fpiw6ue,1588672770.0,I am sorry but I laughed at the bio ðŸ˜‚. It's like zero fucks given. Maybe I should sign up and write crazy bipolar bitch.
bipolar2,fpjl5so,t1_fpi0p49,1588672645.0,This illness sucks. Not knowing what part of personality is the disease and what part is you.
bipolar2,fpjl37u,t3_gdies0,1588672566.0,Well I was feeling a lot of things. Thanks for putting it into words. To be honest it looks similar to what I wrote at 17 in my suicide note. I am with you. Thank you for this post. You post made me feel grounded. I am a mess right now. I now feel less like a freak knowing someone else is also facing same things. Sorry if my reply seems narcissistic.
BPD,fpjk6mr,t3_gcsklr,1588671585.0,I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 but I feel all of this. I now wonder if there's comorbidity. Is that possible or it was wrong diagnosis. Especially awareness of self destructive behavior.
BPD,fpjjw8h,t1_fpj6xdb,1588671269.0,Recently there was a series Modern Love. Anne Hathaway episode was on bipolar. I feel it's a step in right direction. Do check it out. I feel mental illness should have more representation like this.
bipolar2,fpjgaip,t1_fpf8pzs,1588667403.0,Totally!
bipolar2,fpho5vg,t3_gd25a9,1588624735.0,Lol. So true ðŸ˜‚
BipolarReddit,fp74q53,t1_fp71sto,1588364015.0,15 days
bipolar2,fp74n1j,t1_fp6uc4t,1588363971.0,Well that sucks.
depression,fp6nthx,t3_gbmgqg,1588355529.0,That is textbook symptom of depression. I am ignoring too right now. I didn't pick up any calls and it was my birthday. Part of why I do it is because I don't have the mental energy. I feel if I can be real with what I am feeling with them then I can talk to them. But I am scared to share any dark or depressing thoughts and end up ignoring them. Also I feel quite numb at the time. Worse is ghosting colleagues as your close friends are now generally familiar with your patterns. Colleagues and acquaintances get offended though.
BipolarReddit,fp6masg,t1_fp6kip9,1588354782.0,I was on medication but can't access due to quarantine. This corona time sucks and is making situation worse for  people like us. At least writing here helped managed a shower after a week.
depression,fp6hdyn,t1_fp6dkkb,1588352373.0,SSRI was prescribed to me when I was young and tried to commit suicide without any counseling and such. I was a mess and  it didn't suit me at all. Frankly it out me off medications. After 12 years went to psychiatrist again. This time I trusted the process took 3-4 tries for combo that worked for me. I was scared of losing my mental aptitude. But surprisingly it got better. It tapered off later though. I am on Wellbutrin which is norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and Latuda. I was bombarded with constant suicidal thoughts earlier. But it's all very calm up there now. Even now when I am off meds for a fortnight I haven't had suicidal thoughts. Just emptiness and nothingness feeling. My insomnia got worse though and I am on regular sleeping pills. Latuda gave me restless leg and some tremors early on but it got better later.
depression,fp6dd4j,t1_fp6btlp,1588350402.0,Thanks. Hope the same for you.
bipolar2,fp6d94u,t1_fp6bvti,1588350347.0,I am trying daily to do yoga or mindfulness but failing. I barely manage to get up and eat. Really this disorder sucks. Pharmacist had limited stock and they don't have now. Sorry to hear about your cancelled appointment. I hope we both manage somehow.
depression,fp6cqmu,t1_fp6c24o,1588350093.0,I was taking and was able to get out of bed. Still everything took effort. I am out of meds now due to quarantine and back to bed and nothingness. So in hindsight they were working wonders. I would say trust your doctor and take mood stabilizer. I was apprehensive at first but now I think it was right decision.
depression,fp6ceus,t3_gbkxjb,1588349933.0,"So acting likable for other people huh...well that's what bothering me too.
Each day I wish to stay true to feeling but I fail. Then end up feeling like two faced liar. I also don't know what my personality is. I couldn't even bring it up to my psychiatrist last year. His diagnosis was bipolar. 

Let's try to be truthful bit by bit. 
Also whenever I have tried to confront I felt that it's not me. Have you ever tried to be not nice. Although my not nice is still nice as I am super nice always."
depression,fp6bcx5,t3_gbkjxi,1588349412.0,I totally relate with obsessing over something and then hating it. Also with the happiness part. Have you gotten professional help for this. Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar. Also sometimes I feel like a totally different person who felt those things. It is also difficult to check if  I was enjoying things or just acting because that's what you are supposed to do.
depression,fp6aiyd,t1_fp69i31,1588348998.0,Thanks for the tip. Didn't know that rule. I am scrolling here today. Mostly spend time on bipolar2 sub. I totally get what you mean. I would hate it too right now if someone told me tomorrow will be better. I guess fake cheerfulness for the world leaked through.
depression,fp6a3pc,t1_fp68as4,1588348784.0,"Did making a new list of books sound good.

I postponed my suicides waiting on new seasons of shows and books sometimes. 2019 was it for me as Game of thrones ended. I wanted to kill myself doubly though after that stupid ending. I was messed up and was on bed for 2 months. My parents dragged me to psychiatrist and I felt better for a while via meds. Sorry for rant.
So a book or show is also something that helps postpone it. Make a long list. 
Don't know if it was helpful."
depression,fp699ht,t1_fp68as4,1588348366.0,Sorry. I didn't consider your feelings. I am too messed up right now.
BipolarReddit,fp67za6,t3_gbh6z1,1588347714.0,I am sorry for your loss. You are a great friend. I wish I had a friend like you.
depression,fp67ltu,t1_fp66d68,1588347525.0,Thank you for your encouraging words ðŸ™‚
depression,fp67bff,t3_gbjoku,1588347377.0,When you reach 35 make a new list of books. Also you will find someone keep trying. I hope these words help you. On a side note I have come to realise love as something of a fantasy. I only understand love of a parent. Romantic love of books and movies feel like fantasy.
depression,fp66eyg,t3_gbjc89,1588346912.0,If you can feel that life can be great then it's good. Hold on to that hope all is not lost. Depression sucks. What to say. I suggest get help if you haven't. I did after 15 years of suffering and things got a bit manageble after that.
depression,fp664wf,t1_fp63n9r,1588346771.0,Yup and it's quite well written. I feel half the stuff that OP has written. I suffer from bipolar got to know pretty late. The change thing I totally relate to. Also crisis works too sometimes. When thing become normal mundane then it all goes to shit.
depression,fp65s5p,t3_gbjn4f,1588346587.0,Try to remember when you were feeling something if you can. I too am feeling empty. I feel like nothing matters right now. I was okay for a while on meds. I would suggest to get professional help.
depression,fp65hgm,t3_gbjxux,1588346432.0,Happy for you. I wish I had the energy to do that. I have not managed to do that in past 15 days. I feel like I am going further in a hole. You should celebrate this win.
depression,fp64zjk,t3_gbj4hr,1588346174.0,Well I am feeling like that nowadays. I have bipolar. I was a bit better after meds. But quarantine has made it impossible to get them. Now I am a total mess. Still talking to family helps sometimes. Although I lie sometimes about my mental state to not make them worry. I would suggest to get professional help and keep talking to family. I understand sometimes doing that is very tough. All you want is to bury yourself in a hole.
bipolar2,fn9w1va,t1_fmsnuxx,1586785890.0,Yes as we can't enter or exit a certain radius.
bipolar2,fmrkrpo,t1_fmozqtd,1586326243.0,I am in India. Case is quite nearby 1 block from my house. Whole area is in quarantine.
bipolar2,fmoub68,t1_fmnvlxw,1586268616.0,Thanks for your support.
bipolar2,fmou8sp,t1_fmoh5r4,1586268579.0,Same. Also watching trailers of movies on youtube.
bipolar2,fmo9fde,t3_fwgo96,1586250428.0,Now I am watching stuff that I don't like.
bipolar2,fmo04ft,t1_fml4wum,1586240653.0,Actually there has been a case in my locality. Whole area is sealed.
bipolar2,fmkqq1q,t1_fmb3p69,1586164899.0,What options do we have though :/
bipolar2,fmkqlwp,t1_fmbc30d,1586164771.0,haha so relatable. Also sometimes I feel like I am in some movie or something and I am just acting for an audience.
bipolar2,fmkqjgp,t1_fm9rjke,1586164690.0,yes but it's very tough to do so.
bipolar2,fmkqis1,t3_fttkzt,1586164668.0,I am working on alternate days as I am in essential services. It goes like one day properly structured with meals and the next lying in bed being apathetic and starving.
bipolar2,fmkqdev,t1_fmkqamr,1586164500.0,That sucks. But at least you know now.
bipolar2,fmkqaw0,t3_fu5b4o,1586164422.0,I am in essential services but on rotation. Now a case has come up in my locality and whole area is sealed. Not been able to go outside for a week now. I have slowly gone into depressed phase. Yesterday was thinking if I do  contract it won't be a bad thing.
bipolar2,fmkq0mt,t3_fuanfb,1586164102.0,Proud of you. I can't manage to  right now.
bipolar2,fmkpxvq,t1_fmjkd93,1586164016.0,It does in my world. I am not eating at all right now. Can't order in coz coronavirus. I am going through a depressive phase. I am jealous that OP has strength to make a sandwich in midnight.
bipolar2,fmkpou3,t1_fmgkmyz,1586163731.0,haha sometimes. It sucks.
bipolar2,fmkpngl,t3_fv3fx9,1586163687.0,This is like a peek in my brain. So relatable.
bipolar2,fmkpkxx,t3_fvu98u,1586163608.0,Yup all the time. Then few weeks later will cringe at night for oversharing.
bipolar2,fmkpfwz,t3_fvr905,1586163449.0,lol
bipolar2,fmkpe60,t1_fmf908j,1586163394.0,Wow you put a lot of my thoughts into words. I hate being inarticulate. It was all jumbled up there. This was my point.What I feel is this has dealyed my attempts both times.
bipolar2,fmkp8gu,t1_fmgbf4r,1586163220.0,It's not about depression per se. But this has helped me sometimes. You do need therapy and meds. I have tried to commit suicide twice. Never attempted again due to the face I saw of my mother when I woke up in hospital. Sometimes I resent them for making me live. But on good days I feel grateful that I live. Anyways good to hear other's perspective on this.
bipolar2,fmkp1cq,t1_fmgdno6,1586163000.0,Well it does not work for me if I am in thores of major depression. But sometime it does. Sometime I hate my family that I have to live for their happiness sake. So no it doesn't work all the time. But sometime it does.
infp,fmex6vp,t3_fs0wce,1586015465.0,Taurus
bipolar2,flzhjd9,t3_fozobb,1585623818.0,totally.
bipolar2,fl3gqyw,t3_flrnin,1584783189.0,About counter productive simultaneous task. I seem to be attached to my phone lately . I will brush while reading news. I am totally into this corona virus stuff. So Iam doing things with phone in hand. Also if I am doing juat one task I get irritated. But multitasking is also ineffective for me. I end up doing things on slower pace.
ibs,fl2ztnb,t3_fm4hfr,1584764405.0,Same . It worries me.
