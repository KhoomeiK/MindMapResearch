bisexual,fp5mteq,t1_focr4pq,1588334640.0,"Things have changed, a lot lmao. I also had a few hookups (not full sex)  with guys in the past few months, and i also started becoming really close with a guy friend from university. At one point we started hooking up, pretty soon had actual sex. 

To be perfectly honest, i think i wasn't ready yet. I don't think it was a mistake tho, he's someone i trust and feel comfortable with, i knew he wouldn't rush me and he was very understanding. We started dating a bit after that and we're still together, and tbh i'm still not 100% comfortable and sure of what i'm doing in the bedroom like i was with my ex girlfriends, but it's getting better over time and with practice. Relationship-wise there's not that big of a difference, i tend to go for a similar type of person, and i think most people do too. The only major thing is that i can be more public about the relationship, not afraid of being attacked on the street, which is nice. 

It takes time to get used to guys if you've only been with girls, but it's not impossible. I'd just advise you to try new things with someone you really trust and who you're very comfortable with. You don't necessarily have to date at first, a fwb is a great setup for experimenting and sometimes it can grow into a relationship."

relationship_advice,fnwd0t9,t1_fnw9gpl,1587316039.0,"Oh damn, at least he's self aware and trying. 

Idk if this is of any help but i can tell you what ive been doing 

I never judge him about his eating habits and make it a point to let him know, though i have expressed concerns about his health and he agreed they were valid

Never try to /push/ new food on him, i know its frustrating especially if its something you enjoyed making and he treats it like its gross without even trying

I let him know he never has to try anything he doesnt want to, but he's always free to have a little bit of something from my plate, or try a new food and give the rest to me if he doesnt like it

Try to make mealtime less stressful especially if you're introducing a new food, but let him know its hurtful to demean something you've made that he doesn't like or want to try, he can just politely decline 

And let him know he's not weird for having food aversions

It takes a lot of time and effort to overcome food aversions especially when theyre tied to mental health, but he needs to be willing to put in the effort, and you gotta be okay with him taking veeeery very small steps, sometimes even stagnating (better that than to regress)"
relationship_advice,fnw947v,t3_g46a29,1587313884.0,"Sounds a lot like my boyfriend, he has aspergers and a lot of foods put him off because of the texture or smell, trying anything new literally makes him gag. 

He might have arfid (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) and, if he's not stubborn as all hell like my guy, maybe try suggesting he speak to a therapist? Food issues like those tend to only get worse with time and it can end up being detrimental to his health."
