BPD,exok97k,t3_ctvfds,1566477833.0,I’m definitely following this.
BPD,exmc88n,t3_cthro6,1566428644.0,"Hang in there... I go through cycles of feeling this way for weeks at a time. But every day that I am still here, still breathing etc means that BPD and CPTSD hasn’t won over me. Sometimes I have to force myself into things then I am able to roll with it. My biggest trigger is people cutting me off in the middle of expressing how I feel. It makes me feel completely invalid and that I don’t deserve to express my feelings. I get tired of explaining to my partner about BPD, CPTSD, triggers etc. it often feels intentional when things happen. I get exhausted with the feeling of people trying to make me normal never accepting me for who I am. I slowly have realized that people who make me feel like shit for BPD, even when I’m trying to explain what it does to me, aren’t worth my time or really my friends. I didn’t ask for BPD and it isn’t my fault that I have BPD but if I don’t put the work in etc then yeah I shouldn’t complain. I’m on meds, smoke weed and go to a psych. I’m definitely putting the work in, just have to accept what I can’t change and work hard to change what is possible."

BPD,exjhff4,t3_ckxbrw,1566350524.0,Update: thought it would get better but it hasn’t. I don’t feel like I can express my feelings verbally without being cut off. It sends me to the moon and I get verbally aggressive after being cut off. I’m really at this point questioning everything around me.

BPD,evsufat,t1_evst2ir,1564756418.0,Usually it gets better but then somehow he falls back into the same routine the moment I show an ounce of contentment.
BPD,evsr1xt,t1_evsgddt,1564754221.0,That’s the thing... I do talk to friends etc. but we’re in a relationship if I keep having to hold everything in and only talk to him when it is to the point of breaking down then why be with someone?
