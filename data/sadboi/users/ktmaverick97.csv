I know it sounds dramatic to compare it to that, but at the end of the day territorial assholes will be territorial assholes whether it’s in the water, in the city, in the boondocks, or anywhere. we’ll never be able to control how other people think and operate, only how we react, so we all either have to get creative about our times/spots to surf or find ways to connect with these guys and mesh our way into the fabric of the spot and earn our keep"
surfing,fdch61w,t1_fdcgbtc,1578274787.0,"the way I see it is that there’s a limited number of waves, and a plethora of surfers in the world, so it’s almost always gonna be a competition for waves. everyone wants to go out and enjoy the ocean, and maybe ive just been blessed to live in an area that’s not crazy crowded. but it’s still always gonna be a competition, not between each other in a “contest” aspect but for the waves I guess. idk don’t take my word for it! but maybe there’s a better spot or better time of day that you can go out and find less people to compete with. i’ve had to get VERY creative about when and where I go surf for that exact reason, and i’ve saved myself loads of heartache"
surfing,fdcf5om,t3_eklwyu,1578273383.0,"I remember getting my first participation trophy in like 3rd grade rec softball, and thought I was so excited. my dad knocked that outta me real quick, reminded me that we lost the game and that if I wanted a real trophy I had to work for it. I thank my lucky stars everyday because I can’t imagine how disappointed i’d be my whole life expecting things just bc I think I should have it. 

flash forward these days, i’ve only been surfing about 4 years and i’m by no means a good surfer, but I paddle out, say my hello’s, and stay in my lane. usually I can chit chat with the local guys a little bit, stay out of their way, and by being courteous and self-aware they 9 times out of 10 are more than happy to offer some tips here and there and encourage me when i’m doing decent. i’ve come to learn that surfing works just like anything else! respect garners respect. 

granted, I have no idea what your break is like but if they really give you a hard time, then the other biggest lesson my dad always taught me was to stand my ground and be assertive in what I know I deserve"

bipolar,fd7dtlu,t3_ek83l7,1578202928.0,"I used to be a pre-med major and a big thing we talked about was how things used to be more “rare” because medicine wasn’t as good at recognizing it until it hit worst case scenario qualifications. Don’t take my word for it, but my educated guess is that medicine has become better at detecting milder forms of bipolar and mood disorders, not just the full blown manic pixie dream girl versions, and therefore it’s becoming more prevalent in numbers. these people could have just been dismissed as acting out, incompetent, lazy, etc. in the past and now medicine is getting better at realizing there’s levels to the disorders.

obviously people can still be misdiagnosed, and you should absolutely bring up any concerns you ever have with your doctor. but if it helps it helps! in my opinion, don’t fix what’s not broken. don’t let it define your identity, but if the medicine and the therapy help you be the person you want to be then keep pushing along."

I was the only one home and my room mates door shut loudly (probably from the wind) and I immediately locked myself in my room paralyzed for like half an hour listening to all the drawers and the doors in the house rattling because of the wind, and was convinced there was someone in my house robbing us and if they knew I was there they’d attack me. 

finally got the balls to run out of my room to the kitchen to grab a large knife and saw a car parked out front that i’d never seen before, which just completely validated my paranoia for me at the time. I texted all my large strong guy friends to come check out the house and help me and they kept reassuring me I was just high.  I was obviously offended and locked myself in my room again until my room mate texted me back and told me it was the neighbors friends car. 

long story short, glad I got my shit together and stopped keeping kitchen knives in my bedroom lmao, but I still get the hushed conversations and faint music playing tricks on my hearing time to time"
