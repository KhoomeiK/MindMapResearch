But If you want your space to come alive while also having beauty you could try thrifting for colorful furniture and swapping it with what you have or painting your furniture/ walls. You may want to take inspiration from the 70s. Some of it can be pretty minimal and still very colorful. 

Also, many minimalists will say “it has to have a function” but I think the function can be to make you happy. So if having a painting in your living room offers you happiness then that’s what matters.
