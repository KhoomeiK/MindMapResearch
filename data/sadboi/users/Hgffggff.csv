Your comment was so inspiring I think I’m going to hang up my tools and go back to school so I can acquire as much knowledge as you. Then I can be a dick when someone ask a simple question, because I think I know more than others. Maybe one day I can get some experience and take the mechanical test to become licensed like yourself. Maybe I could even take the electrical exam as well. If I’m quick I can do all of this before I’m 32. 

Wait... I did. Fuck off. Whenever a question is asked on Reddit you shouldn’t be a dick rather you should be helpful and make constructive comments.
