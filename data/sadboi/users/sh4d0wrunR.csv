Reliving moments around the traumatic experience can be common, as can the physical and emotional trauma you go through when struggling with these memories. 

Make sure you check in with who you are seeing for medication or CBT - make sure you stick the path and get CBT or NLP with your appointments - if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with your psych or if they are wanting to hop you from one med to the next without proper psychological review, shop around and find a better doctor. 

If medical cannabis is legal in your state and doesn‚Äôt clash with any medication you are on - proper medical CBD in the right ratio might be able to help with the inflammation and stress caused in your body by experiencing these terrible emotions time and time and time again. 

No matter what - write down or talk to someone about your experience. A stranger online * might help * but you might find better security and stability from a third party who is not emotionally involved in a friendship with you. 

Trauma is better OUT than kept in - even at the expense of tears. With the right company, I‚Äôve found just talking about my anxiety and PTSD to help."
