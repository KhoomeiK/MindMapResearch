My wife also has to deal with my depression but i try not to take it out on her . I just become very quiet and that scares her so she does not know how to deal with it but in the last year of our marriage it has become easier . She understands that i just need to get through that phase. Tomorrow should be better

To be honest although this sub drains me emotionally i feel like i want to help people even if it is just a word of encouragement but i have no clue who is just seeking attention or in desperate need of help"
depression,fix055b,t3_fab9bs,1582809123.0,Wow mate that is a lot to deal with . I don't know how you do it but damn you 2 are heroes in my book .   I know i can't say much that will help but just know that you and your wife are doing a great job considering the circumstances.

depression,fit9sxt,t1_fir7e9k,1582711179.0,yea that sucks mate just keep on doing it . Something should pop up eventually .   It doesn't matter what jobs we do as long as the cash keeps on coming and at least there is no blank space on your resume . Employers hate that
depression,fipq5r0,t1_fip1i1p,1582616102.0,My exact sentiment .  That does beg the question . Does that reveal a personality trait pertaining to life ?  You are there might as well just finish it.

depression,fimpdp8,t3_f8m80b,1582541306.0,Sounds like you need to make a choice mate.  Either you stay with your wife and rededicate your life to her or you leave her .  Staying with someone just for the sake of not wanting to hurt them is much worse than just being straight with them .   If my wife liked somebody else i would like her telling me that . At least then i can decide how i want to proceed.   Not physically cheating on somebody does not make it right.  So if you care for this other woman in a more romantic way then maybe its time to move on even if this other woman don't like you in the same way. Experience taught me that its better to hurt somebody in the short term than stringing them along and hurting them for a long time. That person could have met somebody that loves them and only them
depression,fijax7k,t1_fi9yivd,1582440222.0,Yea i hear you . Most jobs suck so nothing really stands out because they are all equally crap. I think the trick is to find one the sucks a bit less .  It all depends on what you can tolerate . For example i took a job where the salary is a bit less but i have a cool manager that does not micro manage me . That is important to me so the rest i can deal with . So it all depends on what you want or what you dislike the most.  But yea by the sounds of things you should really quit your job . Sounds like a living hell

We are one retrenchment\\layoff  away from the poor house.  A lot of people live beyond their means, meaning if something should happen you will be screwed.  Is it good to plan for the future ? Yes of course but by no means is it secure.  A mate of mine saved a ton of money . Him and his wife were going to quit their jobs and open a business but life happens . They lost everything and has to start over at 45.  I know this is not very motivating but that is not my point . the point is that no matter what we do anything can happen so being anxious over it only makes life a living hell. If i have to live on the streets then so be it .  Hopefully not having access to healthcare will shorten my life and i wont live to 80 .  To be honest those bums look more happy than i do most of the time"

O yea forgot to say i am diagnosed bipolar and manic depressive. Not saying anything about your situation just trying to say that it feels like every thing sucks and it does but we need to find something to latch onto that gives us some semblance of joy or something closely related to joy"
depression,fi67ebl,t1_fi48kt4,1582181704.0,"Its natural to romanticize love. We all do it but after a few months the chemicals start balancing out and things start go back to normal. Then it becomes work . I don't say this to be nasty but relationships are extremely hard work .  the things is you and your partner will need the same type of work ethic and if one does not contribute as much as the other then there will be some feelings of resentment. Some apparent some not so apparent.   Contribution is subjective it depends on the value to the other person . For example i would not be able to be with somebody that does not work even if that person is contributing to the home in a different way. I will become resentful . Maybe not apparent but it will eat at me and manifest in different ways. 
You are right love is completely conditional .  It is sad but it is true. For example if i cheated on my wife , she would not think twice divorcing me .  That is a condition.  Not even love towards your parents are unconditional. If your parents kept on abusing you would disown them . 
Relationships are symbiotic. We take and give if we just give then it wont work .  But that is subjective as well.
I agree that if people could be more honest with each other the world would probably be a better place or at least we wont waste our time . 
But it isn't all doom and gloom . there are people out there that shares the same values as you its just a matter of finding them."

My wife lied to me about having a kid when i met her and even a few dates after that.

 Been PB fan for more years than i care to mention so i don't envy this Spanish  company . Its always tricky when working with nostalgia . Expectations are normally too high and people hate change .  See what happened to the star wars franchise.

Points of notice 

Unnamed Hero talks way to much , Lessen the banter and make your conversation more like the Witcher if i can use that example. Short and to the point ( sarcasm would be appreciated)

the fighting system is interesting ,   I like the different parry stances but the camera angles sucks! 

I don't like the Dialog UI . It seems all modern RPG's are going this route . It feels like they dumb it down for console players but i still like the old school UI . It must feel like i am reading a book .  I am role playing after all . 

I like the new Diego ,  I always thought when i played Gothic one and 2 that he was Spanish perhaps .

All the previous ages had some common goal or ""camaraderie"" people had a tough time but they faced it together in the modern age we are all alone and a very few people care.

depression,f8xqwxr,t3_e2v0x3,1574929680.0,That bloody sucks mate. But if you want to just chat or whatever then just pop a message .  Misery loves company as they say .
depression,f8xqs9a,t3_e2v5s3,1574929495.0,If you told me 5 years ago that i would be doing a dead end job with no prospects i would have laughed yet here we are.
depression,f8xos04,t3_e2un3e,1574926825.0,i commend you for your strength . You are a better parent than most and i hope that you can keep staying strong for their sake.  Heroes aren't born but made.
depression,f8ru5e5,t1_f8rtcdd,1574753288.0,I did not say i turned out fine and dandy . I still battle with self loathing issues but i have taught myself to control it better.   You are right the only person that can convince you is you .  I sincerely mean this when i say that i hope you can learn one day not to be this hard on yourself. Life is difficult enough mate . You don't need the extra bashing from yourself.
depression,f8rsytv,t1_f8rsev1,1574751762.0,"I hated myself for years , just like you mate .  I hated my face i hated how dumb i am i hated how lazy i was and worst of all i hated the fact that i always worried about what people thought about me.  You asked me how do  you do it . The answer is easy . I just decided one day ,  enough is enough . I was killing myself for what?  For some asshole who wont give a fuck if i am gone . Nah . Fuck that !  I do what i want when i want and if people don't like it then fuck em. It is a choice that you have to make .   The brain is a powerful device. If people can convince other people that they are chickens then i am sure i can convince myself not to give a shit"
depression,f8rs5l6,t3_e1tx76,1574750774.0,"Just stop giving a shit? I know it is easier said than done but for me that is the only way to survive in this world . If every successful person in this world were scared of what people thought of them nothing would ever be done. You cant be afraid of failure. Ride or die trying.

That is my 2 cents and i know it sounds like fortune cookie advise but it is still true though."
depression,f8rrikn,t1_f8oiofp,1574750020.0,"I understand the room part. I used to not be able to even fall asleep if my slippers weren't perpendicular to my bed , lol but preparing for social interaction sounds like a pain in the ass.  At least you have a lot of hobbies to keep your mind preoccupied . I suppose it is all about distraction."
depression,f8rr9bh,t1_f8p3139,1574749730.0,There is no point mate . i guess you make your own point.
depression,f8oi1z2,t1_f8oh2vn,1574682039.0,feeling like people want to bully you or embarrass you . Is there a reason why you feel like that ? does it stem from somewhere or have you always felt like that ?  what type of decisions is hard for you to make or is it just all general decisions
depression,f8ogy1q,t1_f8ogf01,1574680457.0,"I feel very fortunate having her especially when you know some parents just don't give a damn. 

&#x200B;

Maybe you should get yourself diagnosed then, just to be sure but yea you don't have to see a psychiatrist to know your symptoms.  Is OCD not something you would feel everyday ?  What makes you feel paranoid ?

Sorry for all the questions. i Just like to know what makes people 'tick"""
depression,f8ogaa6,t1_f8odlj1,1574679445.0,"yea i love her to death man .  I have always had a good relationship with her . She is extremely intelligent and we can talk about anything .  She is probably the reason why i have good taste in woman.  I can smell bullshit from a mile away , lol . 

What personality disorders do you have if i may ask?"
depression,f8o8by0,t3_e1cdj7,1574667248.0,"don't think Japan is a good idea.  Those guys work themselves to death , literally. Seems beautiful but its going going to be a culture shock of note"
