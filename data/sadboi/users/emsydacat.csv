mentalillness,fr03mus,t1_fr033mh,1589782756.0,"I got that you were, but I get excited about topics and decide to over explain myself anyway, ha! I completely agree with you. And now that I actively think about it, a lot of the highly stigmatized disorders among professionals stem from trauma. Both cluster B's and dissociative disorders do. That's quite interesting, and I wonder why and if any analysis has been done on that... In contrast, the stigmatized ones among the general public tend to be behavioral/cognitive disturbances, which is also interesting.

And yeah, in terms of paraphillic conditions, I can't imagine. I have absolute utter respect for the ones who don't act on their thoughts but rather are fearful of them and want to get help. The ones who accept themselves? They are the ones I have no respect for. Additionally, I see fetish communities (who do it in a consensual, healthy way that builds on the relationship) be angry about the existence of them, thinking that the psychology ""community"" (scientists and doctors, really) are purely saying they have a disease. I've tried explaining it to some of them, but it clearly just shows a lack of public information, only adding to the stigma. I truly feel bad for those with paraphillias..."
AskReddit,fr0153b,t1_fqzyeyk,1589780720.0,"I only slightly agree with this. Having a personality disorder doesn't warrant being a dick. A disorder is an explanation, not an excuse. No disorder gives someone the ok to be an asshole. If you're not already getting help, please do. CBT and DBT can work wonders for people with PD's.

Note: rejecting people is ok, being a dick about it is not."
mentalillness,fr007h1,t1_fqzzntz,1589779985.0,"I think it's a bit more complicated than just blatantly comparing everything. Yes, more and less stigma exists, but it gets hard since you have to look at the ways in which they are occurring. Are we speaking of the general public or professionals? It gets complicated... Like, among professionals, cluster B PD's and dissociative disorders are probably the most stigmatized. In the general public, psychotic disorders and mood disorders (including anxiety, depressive, and bipolar disorders). Everything else falls along each spectrum.

However, I've got to say that if we're combining everything, people with paraphillic disorders are probably treated the worst since the individuals we hear about are the ones who act on it or normalize it. The people who genuinely have intrusive thoughts and hate themselves can't get help because of how asking for help or confiding in someone would go. In addition, most people forget or don't even realize they exist."
mentalillness,fqzz91f,t3_glmyo2,1589779225.0,"Having stigma and thinking your disorder is worse are two different things. One is literal fact and one is fiction.

For context, I have quite intense mood swings and quite a few other symptoms, and I struggle a lot on my day-to-day life, but appointments tend to catch me in a moment where I'm typically either feeling meh, stressed and wanting to leave, or cheerful. The symptoms that I report are being written off, and I can't figure out why they seem to think I'm faking everything. I'm a minor (almost an adult), so I don't know if it has to do with bias because of my age or something, but I've seriously given up on trying to get proper treatment by this point when I can't get professionals to take me seriously, even my mother (she enjoys ""correcting"" me on what *I* report, as if she sees me 24/7 and knows how to describe what's going on in my head better than I do)...

So, yeah... could my incongruent affect be a part of it? Or could it be something else? I would love to know what a psychiatrist thinks, since even switching who I see hasn't helped. At least he's less condescending and direct about it than my old one...

However, my mother had me tell my now old psychiatrist, who basically just told me I'm faking DID (I had barely even heard of the disorder at this age) and that it's not real and to stop when I refused antipsychotics. He acted as if I was blatantly lying, which hurt since they were my ""friends"" and I didn't want to get rid of them...

pointlesslygendered,fp1ddy5,t1_fozlsxf,1588231801.0,"I refer to myself as female typically cuz I'm at an age that I'm not a ""girl"" since I'm not a child but calling me a ""woman"" is creepy since I'm not an adult. Plus I never know what people want to be called so imo I think science terms is the best way to go until I'm informed otherwise... at least where I live."
BorderlinePDisorder,fp1cbnx,t3_ga02dn,1588230835.0,THIS IS ME. I have not identified with something so hard in a while...
BorderlinePDisorder,fp1c0d2,t3_gaa6md,1588230548.0,"Medication is supposed to help you, not make you feel like emotionless crap. Maybe you can talk to him about addressing his lack of emotional expressing to his psychiatrist??? But just do your best to communicate with him about the situation in a calm, non-accusatory manner and maybe he'll see it like you do."
BorderlinePDisorder,fp1bmgd,t3_ganqhd,1588230200.0,"You absolutely did the right thing! What you went through is awful and no one should ever have to, no matter the severity. I hope you talk to someone you trust about it. If you need to vent or something, just dm me- I'm here for you."
dndnext,fp0ty48,t1_fp04lv3,1588216850.0,"Geeze. As a newbie, that seems super impressive. I'm not familiar with the classes and races enough yet. Experimenting with characters helps a bit, which is what I'm doing."
dndnext,fozjg0g,t1_fozj5vc,1588191680.0,"I responded to this thinking you were the OP and it was like 2-3 AM during insomnia. I'm so sorry, haha! Now that I read this fully awake, I have no clue how I read it like that or what my thought process was... welp!"
dndnext,foz8gi3,t1_foygmbz,1588186427.0,"Oh, I don't plan! I just write and rewrite until I get something I'm happy with, ha'"
dndnext,foy2lw6,t1_foy23iq,1588163771.0,Totally get you. But learning a new class and race takes me like 4 hours so... I'm sometimes up till 3-4 AM working on a character. I will go until my cognitive ability just shuts down and yells at me to sleep.
dndnext,foy2hp6,t1_foy0taz,1588163687.0,True.
dndnext,foy2g1a,t1_foy08x3,1588163653.0,"I just use mythweavers and I have my own folder on my DM's account so that he can supervise me instead of me yelling at him every two seconds if I'm allowed to do this or that. Like, come on he just wants to play Minecraft uninterrupted for at least 5 minutes. I can be relentless, ha! He's a great DM though and is happy to take suggestions and work with a players to fit their character ideas into the world with some tweaks. I mean, he let me design the country of the character I made for the campaign on our map basically on my own. Then he approved it and added some stuff.

Also, I usually use backgrounds as a way to immediately flesh out my idea and then expand upon in the backstory. I find that works the best for me since I kinda get a prompt then, lol."
dndnext,foy22gy,t1_foxyllu,1588163372.0,Wow. That's seriously impressive (the video). Like... *oh my lord slow down my dude.*
dndnext,foy1upc,t1_foxybyr,1588163206.0,"Thank you so much for the tips! It's sincerely appreciated, as I am new..."
dndnext,foy1pic,t1_foxxke0,1588163098.0,"See, if you mean a full day as in 12 hours, then I totally get that. Seems much more reasonable than those guys over there that can bang one out in 15 minutes, geeze..."
dndnext,foy1mea,t1_foxxajt,1588163032.0,"Ha! Yeah, I tried making a vanilla character, but I couldn't. Oh well!"
dndnext,foxwtoq,t1_foxwrg9,1588158965.0,"Yeah ok I think I just put wasaaaay too much thought into characters, haha."
dndnext,foxwhj4,t1_foxwfj1,1588158645.0,...geeze. Major respect there. I seriously don't know how you guys do it.
dndnext,foxw8pe,t1_foxw17a,1588158416.0,"Wow... I seriously can't imagine going that quickly. Although, some of my character ideas have made my lovely DM go... wha? Like I asked him what might be good for this idea class-wise and he just goes ""I have no clue- emsy, this is DnD, but [gives as best a suggestion as possible]"". Yeah I made a Film Noir Femme Fatale Assassin Rogue (Changeling). Why? Because I can and she's absolutely awesome. But yeah, rambled there. Major respect to your speedy skills!"
dndnext,foxvytq,t1_foxvllt,1588158154.0,"Interesting! I couldn't imagine 20 minutes... especially since I only have two characters that share a class (but not archetype), and so they're all so different and I have to learn from square one each time.

But the thing is... nor have I. My current backstories are the basics of it but general until I have a campaign/world to put them in. And even then, they're focused on what makes the character them, not every aspect of their childhood.

Maybe it's because I come up with ideas like an Ice Genasi Draconic Bloodline (Silver) Sorcerer who is themed as a French Rococo lady. She's a noble and is the heiress to the throne of the country she comes from (only the royal family is genasi). She's super sympathetic (even if she can't understand being poor) and genuinely wants to help the common-folk, as their suffering saddens her deeply. Therefore, she is well liked and known, making her a great diplomat for RP. But hey, she hates shoes."
