If you put your lips over your teeth, so like to cover them, you can (start gently) using your lip covered teeth to provide pressure while doing it. My boyfriend likes when I do it. 

Warning though, using too much pressure this way and for too long can irritate the inside of your lips, but it shouldn't hurt him. Especially if he prefers a good amount of pressure."
BPD,fmm1w5l,t1_fmm14so,1586197252.0,"Anyone can make one, and besides, BPD is one of the most negatively stigmatized, misdiagnosed, and misunderstood mental illness. 
Studies show that even some mental health professionals have more stigmatizing views about BPD than any other mental health condition. 

The goal of this isn’t to exclude the others at all. Most of the more common and well known mental illnesses are spoken about way more than BPD. There is definitely an unfair misconception associated with this disorder that goes beyond what the other illnesses deal with. Most people haven’t even heard of BPD and assume it’s Bipolar disorder, where as everyone has heard of and has some knowledge on anxiety, depression, OCD, etc. 

I just want people to be better informed and educated about it, as well as helping to reduce the heavy negative stigma that comes with it."

The light of you getting a place and being more independent and out form underneath your parents is still there if you keep it there. No one else can keep that light shining but you.

I just a very passionate about people who suffer with BPD finding and helping themselves and not soley relying on others for their happiness and stability. I am proud that you are being realistic about this decision and understanding that itll take a couple years. I think that a compromise is definitely what needs to be done. Specifiy you and your bfs goals to each other, because if his goal is to move in with you and start a life with you and what not, then his actions (and purchases) need to match that. otherwise his goal is somethign else and hes just saying that to make you feel better"
relationships,fjkj7g5,t3_fdx44w,1583427868.0,"Hello 23/F here. I have BPD too so I definitely feel for you. I also live with my mother still and am actively trying to find a job as I am a recent graduate. I have been with my boyfriend for nearly a year and he makes decent money and lives in an apartment with his brother. I think that the fact that you are unable to have a job because of your mental health and havent yet been able to get therapy for it because you are on a waiting list, may indicate that you should;t move out yet if it mean you have to solely rely on somebody else. From personal experience, I think you need to have started therapy and really progressed in it to a point where you are able to get a job so that you can get a place on your own without anybodies help. Being dependent on someone is not a trait of BPD that you should latch onto. I suggest really focusing on yourself and getting yourself to a point where you can work and help to afford a place WITH your boyfriend instead of expecting him to be responsible for bailing you out of the situation that you don;t like. I hate living at home too, but for my own self and mental health, I need to get my own job and be independent on my own without the help of anyone, especially my boyfriend."

BPD,fisbp60,t1_fis7ajx,1582681765.0,"Oh yes tone plays a huge role in communication and is often unnoticed by the person that it is negative or whatever. 
One thing I do want to say is that yes, definitely support, understand, comfort, and reassure her but at the same time that doesn’t mean she gets to react and behave in negative ways or even almost punish you when she is unreasonably triggered. I understand that our thoughts and emotions are sometimes out of our control, but our actions and how we respond to those thoughts and emotions are 100% in our control. 
Anyways, the whole “taking some space to separate and calm down” is a tricky one. Some people with BPD are okay with it and agree that they need some space too but a lot of people (like myself) can’t stand taking space and time to calm down. If she is anything like me, maybe suggest taking some space in the way of you two being in different rooms for however long it takes for her to relax, this way she knows you’re in the other room and you aren’t literally physically separated by a big gap like if she were to go to her house or something.

BPD,firdlyd,t3_f9es2k,1582662372.0,"Hello! 

I think that one key thing when communicating things like boundaries with someone with BPD is not only WHAT you say but HOW you say it. Unfortunately, there is a very narrow path on how to communicate well with someone with BPD as the slightest drift off that path will probably be taken bad. 

One thing that I appreciate hearing from my partner when I am expressing my thoughts/feelings is for them to say that they understand how I could think/feel the way I do towards something that was said/happened before then telling me that its an irrational thought. It's could be beneficial to help her fact check situations; if she is having irrational/unreasonable thoughts about something, help her state the facts that prove those negative thoughts/feelings are not right/valid/reasonable."
relationships,fio5i1j,t3_f8tddb,1582576686.0,"HI! I have no idea why everyone is jumping down your throat about being shallow and entitled and shit. If this was the other way around and a girl was complaining about her bf not putting in any effort around her but with his friends/family, I bet she wouldn't get the same comments. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, it is VERY REASONABLE to want your significant other to sometimes (on dates and what not) to put in a little effort to look good. 

I usually wear baggy sweats/t-shirts/hoodies with my mans on a daily but sometimes I love to dress up for him/me when we go out coz I want to look and feel good, especially if he is putting in some effort. Now this whole family thing, I never dress up with my family (they are obviously the people I feel very comfortable with), so I personally find it odd that she puts in a lot of effort to look good around her family and not with you at all."

BPD,f6k74p3,t3_drp51v,1572906456.0,"Hey! I am also in a 3 hour long distance relationship because I go to university. 

A huge thing my therapist taught me is to fact check. Check the facts. 
• College involves lots of work outside of class times
• College is super stressful
• A lot of people don’t like to leave work till the day of because it causes extra stress and less time to get help  
• She told you she had homework 
• She apologized for not being able to give you attention for a good reason 

I understand your anger, because I too would normally be angry when my expectations are not (especially unrealistic ones). The fact that she is doing homework and thats the reason for not being able to give you as much attention, is totally reasonable. 

I say that you should try to calm yourself down with whatever tactics help, go back in there with her and ask if theres anything you can do to help. If not, just be with her, being around her and in her presence is better than not seeing her at all. If you provide a relaxing and happy environment while she is stressed doing work, she will feel happier and be very grateful for you understanding and helping her out. 

Hope this helps!"

BPD,f4y80so,t3_dm6y8r,1571873296.0,I would say my ability to stand up for myself and for others that can’t. I will protect and defend my loved ones in situations where they aren’t able to. Idk if this is a good one or not.
BPD,f4w5vuo,t3_dlyacg,1571852156.0,"You need to fact check. Check the facts, does he listen to me? Does he do things for me? Does he show me affection? Etc. if so then he cares about you and ur paranoid thoughts are not true and need to try and push them away. Also, maybe communicating with him before u reach that peak of anger"
BPD,f4vf56m,t3_dlk5n8,1571841496.0,"If someone happens to be manipulative, it has nothing to do with their BPD diagnosis. Saying, I am manipulative and manipulate people by threatening suicide or whatever, that means I have BPD; and it doesn’t mean that at all. 
There are many articles and papers and research books done by various psychiatrists and doctors that strongly recommend and are against stating that people with BPD are manipulative because it isn’t true. Literally just google it :)"
BPD,f4v1t6m,t1_f4ua4nr,1571835006.0,"I have read many research articles, papers, and books on BPD. Manipulation is nothing to do with BPD. If someone is manipulative, then that is the person themselves, whether they have BPD or not They may have BPD, but being manipulative isn’t part of it of the disorder. If someone with BPD happens to be manipulative, if they seek therapy and what not and happen to fall out of the diagnosis for BPD, they will most likely still have manipulative characteristics since it has nothing to do with the disorder."
