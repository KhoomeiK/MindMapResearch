kratom,fb4xvt9,t3_eb62pl,1576517393.0,"Yeah kratom (and most medicines) really only works for me if I take it on an empty stomach, then have a fatty snack or small meal. The fat helps my system grab the painkilling properties."
kratom,fb4xcv4,t1_fb4qh74,1576517143.0,I second this. 😊
SuicideWatch,fb4ud0g,t3_eapk93,1576515669.0,"My daughter attempted suicide by overdosing on what she could find in the house. Like EVERYTHING she could find. She became very sick, completely lost touch with reality, a lot of vomiting, hallucinating, tremors. This lasted 6+ hours, there wasn’t much they could do at the hospital, only gave a few medications. She survived, and has with some damage to her memory."
kratom,fb04668,t3_earveo,1576422407.0,Yes! 🤣🤣
SuicideWatch,fat9alg,t3_eakgqn,1576335941.0,I want to respond to you but I can’t find the right words! ❤️❤️❤️
SuicideWatch,fat8uvb,t3_eakfsr,1576335786.0,"I’m answering as a female with my own mental health issues. If she’s already revealed that she’s bipolar then I think it’s safe to start sharing a little about your own issues. I only tell ppl that if I’m really trying to get close to them OR scare them away lmao!  I think a whole lot more ppl deal with suicidal thoughts then we know, they just don’t talk about it.  So I’d start a safe conversation and see how it goes, you share, she shares, like that. My best to you ❤️"
SuicideWatch,fat55e8,t1_fat4eay,1576334827.0,"You’re right, thank you for reminding me.  Being a single parent is really tough but I would honestly be dead if it weren’t for my kids. I’m going to try to get the tree up this weekend, I’m mad at myself it’s not up yet. Lol humans make life so much harder for themselves, don’t we? 💚"

SuicideWatch,fasvchg,t3_eabg4j,1576331857.0,"I was 15 when I found out my dad wasn’t actually my father, and it is earth shattering. Anyone who says it’s not a big deal obviously hasn’t been thru it. Now it didn’t ruin my life or anything, but it was a mind fuck for sure. It’s obviously very hard to generalize with disease, but is it possible it might be wrong to assume your life span? I have a bit of experience with medical issues and I lost a lot of respect for the medical community. I found out that they really don’t know as much as they think they do, just a thought for you to chew on. Are there support groups for your illness? I’ve found that other sufferers really DO get it and I was surprised to see how many of them are openly depressed about it - versus the show on social media, look at me ‘surviving happy’ kinda bullshit. Although there is a time and place for that too. Idk I hope this ramble helped a little, you’re not the only one feeling those things and you might be able to find a group you CAN cry in front of. ❤️"
SuicideWatch,fasshvb,t1_fas8f52,1576330879.0,"Then again, actually having the gun is pretty serious, I forgot about that part, heh."
SuicideWatch,fass4ua,t1_fas8f52,1576330751.0,I think it depends on many factors - like what language you use can determine how serious they feel you are. Saying that you fantasize about killing yourself is a little different than saying “I’m definitely going to do it”.   So I think if you approach it right it doesn’t necessarily mean an automatic inpatient.
SuicideWatch,faoxg5r,t1_fa3nuhb,1576274807.0,"When I was 15 my mom caught me cutting myself, it turned into her crying while my father screamed at me , “ look what you’re doing to your mother, why are you doing this TO US”. That pretty much is how she handles my mental health, something that’s happening to her.  Now that I’m a parent myself, I am really worried about how much I’m fucking up my own kids’ lives, ( with my mental health issues) because that shit was so damaging."
SuicideWatch,faowffj,t3_e05a1k,1576274135.0,Omg I relate so much

kratom,fa9zqfy,t3_e88qw3,1575897966.0,"I’ve been taking flu meds with Kratom this past week, with no negative side effects. I did notice some possible potentiation (is that a word? Lol) but it wasn’t earth shaking. However when I added a muscle relaxer it was definitely bedtime 😂"
kratom,f96p9iv,t1_f96mjs4,1575149384.0,"Personally, I think that’s a good use for it, and relatively “safe”.  👍"
kratom,f96ejzy,t3_e41tb8,1575143918.0,"I have ptsd, agoraphobia and severe general anxiety. Kratom is not without its downsides, but it’s helped immensely. I take it mostly for pain and discovered it really helped anxiety. The problem, IMO, is that if I  take it too often, I can then get rebound anxiety when I don’t take it. It’s definitely better as a temporary crutch then a cure-all, at least when it comes to anxiety."
kratom,f93uznm,t3_e3ffyg,1575069237.0,I relate lol
kratom,f6fnzl4,t1_f6fd43x,1572816324.0,"I also recommend trying another vendor. I had also kind of “worn out” my red Bali, and recently switched brands, and it made a huge difference. I have a new favorite!"
kratom,f66ietu,t1_f644vby,1572711184.0,"I have a fibromyalgia diagnosis, I take Kratom for pain and it DOES help, often more than the narcotics I was taking. When I got my MMJ card I could no longer get my prescriptions and I was forced to find an alternative  , which is Kratom - but absolutely no regrets. Cannabis and Kratom have me feeling less pain and more ALIVE!"

kratom,f5w62yd,t3_dp55ox,1572515238.0,"Medical marijuana and Kratom are way better for me than the pills. Not only is it way more effective, I feel more alive since I’m not drugged to the gills. I’m very grateful to have them available to me."
kratom,f211sk8,t3_db7r5e,1569866795.0,"I have a fibro diagnosis and suffer from body wide chronic pain, amongst other health issues. I've been using Kratom instead of pills for about a year now, I find that helps more than something like vicodin, and it lasts a lot longer too. The only issue i have is I'm concerned about the effects on my digestive system, liver, and pancreas mostly, since i have history there. But, as someone pointed out, it's better than suicide (which occasionally my compounding chronic illnesses cause me to dream about)."
