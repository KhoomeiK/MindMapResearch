>Currently, American gay people believe they have a unique ability to pick each other out in a crowd (often termed “gaydar” [“gay” + “”]). This was established through a nationwide Internet-mediated survey (n = 460). To test for the presence of this ability in gay men, the researcher asked self-identified gay and straight male participants to view a series of unfamiliar men on videotape and determine the sexual orientation of each. The higher overall accuracy of gay men demonstrated a trend level difference from their straight cohorts although falling short (primarily due to small sample size) of the p < 0.05 level. A theory for the emergence of this skill (termed “Adaptive Gaydar” by the author) as a unique perceptual ability/coping mechanism unique among gay people is also presented.

One thing that bugs me, and many others, is how the History of how G.A.Y. was used from Victorian times as a clever way to be closeted and open at the same time and HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO ERASURE since the 1960s. 

G.A.Y. is an acronym which is ""Good As You"". In the 60's and 70's the political identitarians demanded in line with the Marxist theory that old language that could be self-oppressing, had to vanish and be banned. The same was very evident with **[POLARI - The Lost LGBT Language](https://youtu.be/7oC3oLV7bVk)**

Hence, G.A.Y. was pushed down and replaced with GLBT and then LGBT. Unfortunately, the group who used and abused Identitrain Theories were and in many ways remain ""Sappho and her mates"". So much G.A.Y. theory and politics were mixed up with feminist theory and it has taken decades to get that tangle dealt with and Separated. 

One minor victory in the UK only took 18 years - Brighton Pride finally had a male-only space. For decades Saphho and her mates had demanded  Female only space by claiming that males were abusive, aggressive and women had to be protected from any and all men - even the queer ones. It was a breach of The European Declaration on Human Rights which were enshrined in UK law as of 1999. Brighton & Hove Council should have banned the Pride events whilst this inequality was enforced and demanded by a small segment fo the G.A.y. community. In 2018 the Pride organisers had had enough of the Saphho and mates blackmailing and threat and put in place a male-only venue for the first time. It was praised globally and recognised as the correct position for all Pride's Globally. Sappho and her mates have been boycotting Pride with male-only space since then. Overall it's made the event so much better, diverse and happy - especially for Trans folk who have been horribly abused by Trans Exclusing Radical Feminists ... or as they are better known Sappho's Berserker Hit Squad.  

Of course, If you are one of the whippersnappers who did not live through those times and know of the machinations and turmoil, you would not know about The Actual History and dismiss it due to ignorance.

AskReddit,fh8cih0,t3_f1tfbh,1581356823.0,"It's worth noting that research globally shows that in most cases of abuse both parties are equally abusive - so neither party believes they have the right to leave or to accuse the other party of abuse. 

A Major reason for men staying with females abusers is the social/biological bias of ""**[Phylogyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philogyny)**"".

This coupled with know ""**[Ingroup-Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism#Automatic_bias_for_own_gender)**"" favouring women and men being ignored by the biases, leads to women, groups of women and society being tolerant of female violence and relational abuse by women.

> research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women's in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger than those of men and only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender.

The profound In group bias favouring women is a major cause of responsibility flipping. If a man reports female violence it gets flipped to she was defending herself and the male was the abuser. At it's most dangerous that In-Group Bias and Responsibility flipping is seen in supposed Domestic Violence support services which automatically treat any male victim as a perpetrator and a male seeking to abuse again.  

This pattern can even be seen in the recent Amber Heard recordings where she, as with most women, are aware that they have a favoured position and bias in society that leads to them taunting their male victims and stating they will never be believed. 

The failure of society to deal with female abusers has been evident since the world's first DV Shelter/Refuge for men was opened in 1974 by Erin Pizzey, Chiswick, London. It was closed within 12 months, because of the lack of support. It was full from day one but socially the issue of Philogyny meant there was zero financial support for male victims and their children.

After 50 years the issues are only now starting to become clear and known."
