Why? Even if we assume all things equal between ag and cattle production as far as damage to ecosystems (because CAFO has it's own issues though I don't necessarily believe as wide-spread compared to ag), inherently there is less waste in cattle production.  


Plants contribute to HUGE amounts of food wastage. Not even addressing the waste that happens before it even reaches the grocery store, after people buy those products it's so common for food to go uneaten and thrown away by the end-user.  


I do want to go back to your previous comment about ""killing two pests on some crops is twice as bad as killing one cow"" because I didn't have the time earlier to remark in detail.

You do realize that use of pesticides is one of the leading causes of bee death, yes? And that decimating bee populations puts agriculture as a whole at risk, yes?

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought it was common knowledge that pesticides cause widespread damage to ecosystems -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental\_impact\_of\_pesticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_pesticides)

&#x200B;

Not to mention the damage that they cause to humans. They can destroy entire waterways... water is quite essential to life, so.. yeah.

No, let me just say that there are billions of men on this planet. The odds that you ended up with a douchebag who just happens to be the best out of the four you've dated are actually really high. I literally have dozens of douchey men a day lined up asking me to date them. Do I pick the best douchey man out of that line? No. I tell them all to go fuck off.

For whatever reason, BPD makes us feel like we need to find somebody to spend our time with romantically... And that would be better to be with an asshole than to be with nobody. That is a straight-up lie that our fucked up brains tell us.

You would absolutely be better off without this person in your life than with him in your life. He has just done you a huge favor by telling you exactly how he feels about you. That you are less than him, that he is better than you, that he saved you. there is no room in a healthy relationship for messiah complexes.

The fact that you point out that you were doing better socially before you met him is also another huge red flag. That indicates that there is a major problem in which isolation of you benefits him. It can be hard for us to see it when we are blinded by our feelings for somebody... But a healthy relationship causes us to be better in every aspect, not worse.

You should absolutely run away from this relationship as soon as possible. If you don't have a close friend to you to tell you that this guy needs to go away permanently... Let me be that friend for you. Don't waste years of your life with somebody who is not healthy for you. You cannot get that time back, trust me.

Given that it's a result of systemic inflammation or illness, it's possible that zerocarb could help it. since inflammatory bowel disease is one of the contributing factors to developing the problem, I would highly encourage anyone with this to work on restoring the gut microbiome.

I don't use ghee or butter for cooking, if I need oil (rarely) I use beef tallow. Doing better than I ever have."
EatingDisorders,fdcecdv,t1_fdc53ok,1578272821.0,"I know exactly how you feel, my mom has an eaten disorder as well and she is actually dying from it right now. And as much as I wish I could shake her and make her eat I can't. None of us can be responsible for any other person, they have to do it themselves which makes it so frustrating and painful sometimes."
EatingDisorders,fdb8fq9,t3_ekb71t,1578254872.0,"I'll probably be the unpopular opinion, but just like a drug addiction the person isn't going to get better until they want it for themselves. 

What pushes them to that point usually isn't an external driver (e.g. someone that loves them saying the right words). 

For everyone that will be something different and individual for them.

For me it took having two heart attacks before I decided I wanted to make changes and even then it wasn't overnight and I had a lot of relapses.

Being supportive is really the only thing you can do, but also take care of your well being."

zerocarb,fd6gghw,t1_fd68lmz,1578190625.0,"No offense taken and not prying. No gender identity issues personally. OP asked about gender identity OR body dysmorphia. My dysmorphia caused me to see my body as much larger than it actually is and triggered several eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia and compulsive exercising because I'm an overachiever /s).  
I no longer experience dysmorphia and also all issues relating to my EDs has resolved as well on zerocarb. I no longer feel obsessive and controlling over food, etc etc etc. I just eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full."

EatingDisorders,fd5v9on,t1_fd5lkw4,1578181927.0,"Yeah, but they're already uncomfortable about the question... I just kind of figured that if somebody is going to ask me a question like that which they probably already know will make me uncomfortable then I might as well give them an answer that will make them uncomfortable for having asked it in the first place. Also, I've been really surprised but being honest about it has brought me closer to other people in my life who I found out also had an eating disorder but it wasn't as obvious. So sometimes it can end up being a net benefit in the end."
