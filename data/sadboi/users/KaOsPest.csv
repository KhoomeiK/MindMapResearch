Trust me, most of those with you are just as clueless as you are about what to do. I had my mother help me sign up for classes even though my advisor gave me a sheet of classes I should take to start out with lol. They should have a sheet in the Student Help office of the different programs and the contact info for each advisor for those programs, so I would start there.

This first semester will be the scariest, but once you get into the motion of things, you will be a little more well-adjusted to your new life in college.

Wednesday we get another chapter or two to read and then have another essay to do that is due on Friday.  As half of our grade, we students must have two ""adequate"" responses to other classmates' essays (We post these in a class forum).  We used to do these once before every exam, but now it makes up our work to make sure we are reading the chapters (We also get no lecture notes or videos).
