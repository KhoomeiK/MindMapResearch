Discussion,fpk5q7l,t3_gdv1qs,1588688507.0,wellll youre not hispanic because you're not from a spanish speaking country. Im Brazilian and I would say I can identify as latino because of the cultural and language similarities with other latin american countries ... but you also have similarities AHHHHH its confusing personally I wouldnt say you are either of them but in the end of the day nothing matters....
kpopthoughts,fpk51i4,t1_fpjdiq8,1588688128.0,Well the style from their first 4 albums was very hip hop based and is DRASTICALLY different from HYYH style which is when they gained more and more popularity. They poured their heart into music from the VERY beginning this was their style so I think the change to HYYH was to gain more popularity as the type of music could be seen more mainstream so they can get more popular (sorry idk if this make sense)
kpopthoughts,fpk46ui,t3_gdpmu0,1588687643.0,i joined the fandom in 2016 and it was rare to find someone who liked kpop back then but I was able to only find 1 school friend and we are still close to this day. Nobody knew who they were here in America  and if someone knew you liked kpop theyd be like wtf is that youre weird. I NEVERRR expected them to get this big and honestly I only stanned them because my online friend introduced them to me as my first kpop group (they didnt seem super special at the time). At that time they were just any group. Except when Fire came out things took a turn and they started to get noticed more and the whole billboard stuff was like wow too fast to comprehend then BS&T came out and they REALLY blew up. Fast foward to 2019 i started seeing so many girls at school with BTS merch (youd only discreetly see someone wearing merch at school 4 years ago) FULL on decked out backpacks with merch. And I also saw a Kpop fan club poster on the wall and boy i was shocked. Now almost EVERYone in my school somewhat knew who they were. I met SOOO MANY girls who were fans like damn and I met a handful of girls at work too. Its absolutely mindblowing.

Im also thankful I had that friend because she taught me the culture and stuff like vlive, award shows, twitter accs, variety shows, etc. its a lot to learn. and on my own i discovered other groups/singers and I learned about the legends of course and groups from every generation. There was so much out there and I am still exploring it and honestly  what would I be without loving kpop? a more boring and close minded version of myself. Im so happy I discovered this whole new world cuz life is too short to not love korean music!!! First BTS song I heard was I Need U and I T_T. This was before Fire came out so they still werent THAT popular because Fire was the turning point. I have this memory of me going to my friends house and she played the I Need U melody on the piano and thinking about it just HURTS MY HEART LIKE UFH AKSKDKDKXNN BTS is really my entire youth because in 2016 I was in 8th grade and now I am a senior. their album ""the most beautiful moment in life "" is ok brb ima cry"
