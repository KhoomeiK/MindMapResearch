mentalillness,f0cz1z9,t1_f0amdef,1568547211.0,"That's what I am afraid of, why I asked here to maybe find a solution.
Exactly why it seems stalker like I feel like it's wrong, but my body seems to not listen to my mind when it comes to it. But can you be friends with a therapist? I thought that's like kinda forbidden? Since it's crossing the line between work and social life.

Yes you helped me a lot, I will try to talk to him about it,  you gave the courage I need for this topic :)
And thanks for your offer, but I always feel like I don't want to bother other people... but I am still grateful"

BPD,f047kpp,t1_f03gaqq,1568381515.0,"That's actually a really brilliant way, thank you.
I will try the 'how it used to happen' one, since it was a severe problem years ago (and obviously now too). I didn't even think about that.

And yeah, I should stop, but it always feels like I am like a mindless robot, on my way I think it's wrong and stupid to do it, but I can't seem to stop.
It just gives me a feeling of being safe for that moment ."

And yea since I am female it does make even more sense.
Thanks"
BorderlinePDisorder,f0479r5,t1_f03t3qy,1568381317.0,"Is it? 
Yea I know what you mean, but for me right now I definitely deny the ending of this 'class'.
It just feels like I can't live without it .


And thank you"
