WildlifeRehab,ffpsn3r,t1_ffaggm3,1580104234.0,"Hello! I'm just starting out, and I contacted a few rehab facilities looking for volunteer opportunities. Unfortunately, there aren't too many around me. Thank you for your response!"
ptsd,fafr97z,t1_faeq3z7,1576029882.0,"It definitely doesn’t affect me as much as it did, but up until two years ago or so I couldn’t even talk about it, mention my rapists/abusers name, or see them without having a panic attack. I also get nightmares often, it used to be almost every night. I got into extremely toxic relationships because I convinced myself that was what I deserved. I nearly failed out of high school because it was so difficult to get out of bed during those years. As for my daily life now, I just have to avoid parking garages, rape/violent scenes in movies or tv, and I’ll have a panic attack if a door slams or someone yells. I still get nightmares once or twice a week. Occasionally I’ll see someone who looks like one of my abusers and will lose it in public, but I’ve been doing pretty good. But it really varies, I’m also bipolar so with my depressive episodes typically my ptsd will get harder to deal with. it’s a constant up and down."
ptsd,fafqnva,t1_faeq32u,1576029460.0,"I got help for the first time in August, when I had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized for 2 weeks. I did Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT for 12 weeks, and I’m currently looking for a regular therapist. It really helped a lot more than I expected it to."
ptsd,fafqhym,t1_faeq1km,1576029345.0,"I’ll just respond to these separately if that works. I was diagnosed last year, but had suspicions years before due to my nightmares and flashbacks."
ptsd,fafqetr,t1_faeq08v,1576029285.0,"I’m glad to answer some questions! I have CPTSD which is Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, caused by reoccurring traumas in my life. As a child I was sexually abused by an older kid (I was 5-8, he was 14-17) and then throughout high school I was in a physically abusive relationship and was raped by someone I considered a good friend. I’m 18."
mentalhealth,fa9k3tz,t1_fa9jpml,1575877082.0,"exactly what I’m seeing :( I appreciate all the important work you’ve done, you probably helped many people in those 5 years. Do you have any tips for me? Besides moving out of California, lol."
mentalhealth,fa9jxcp,t1_fa9j7n2,1575876848.0,"Yes, that's true, there are lots of perks! I live in Riverside County, Menifee area. Honestly an extremely boring place and not the most beautiful compared to the rest of California. But if you don't mind driving 45 minutes to an hour, finding therapy shouldn't be too difficult, and yes, some amazing spots in nature that help alot!! Transportation's just an issue for me right now."
mentalhealth,fa9irx7,t3_e85b72,1575875386.0,"yup, going through this right now. moved to a desert town in southern california and there's such an absurd lack of resources compared to when I  lived in Pittsburgh. Might be months before I see anyone and I honestly don't know if I'll make it without going to a crisis center."
Needafriend,f9l73u6,t3_e5oemb,1575416006.0,message me if you’d like :)
bipolar,f9ky51s,t3_e5hzw0,1575410251.0,I would definitely tell her what you saw and how that made you feel. This is her job and she needs to know how to do it better. and then definitely find someone better who cares :) good luck!
rape,f81uo9v,t1_f819jdq,1574177742.0,"I know that’s how it feels. I carried that guilt and disgust with myself for so long. But it wasn’t your fault. Rape means no consent. You didn’t consent and it’s as simple as that. It’s entirely up to you what you want to do with this, but I recommend finding a therapist in your area who specializes in trauma-based therapy. It’s helped me to “move on” from what happened for the most part, and to understand it wasn’t my fault. Again I’m sorry this happened to you."
InlandEmpire,f80l1ao,t1_f80kz2n,1574131592.0,nahhh thanks though! been exploring all over Pittsburgh for 5 years now and never had an issue!
rape,f7zrjl0,t3_dy7b3h,1574115039.0,"You are not disgusting. None of this is your fault. I know that there isn’t much more I can say to comfort you in a situation like this but you aren’t overreacting, or a sore loser, and you certainly didn’t owe him anything. I’m so so sorry you had to go through this and that you have to live each day feeling like you are at fault. Whether or not you said no does not matter. You didn’t say yes. He KNEW you were uncomfortable. He was in the wrong and he knew better."
CPTSD,f7zqlco,t3_dy6ymx,1574114626.0,"Checking myself into the hospital was one of the best choices I’ve made. If you have a plan and you need help, go to the hospital. There are people there who care and will get you professional help. I’m sorry you’re feeling this way & I really do wish you the best."
ptsd,f7zq1xh,t3_dya1jz,1574114393.0,"Definitely talk to your counselor, and consider getting into therapy. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) has worked wonders for me. Check out psychologytoday.com and look for therapists/psychiatrists who specialize in trauma-based therapy. Or even have your school counselor help you find one. It’s hard reaching out to get help, but it can change your life. As for in your daily life, I can only recommend grounding techniques that you’ve probably been recommended before, but you may as well give them a shot. I’ve found that journaling, art, and yoga help me the most when I’m dealing with flashbacks and nightmares, or rough days in general.  Any other activities you might enjoy normally can help to get your mind off things ie: sports, hiking, running, reading etc. But therapy is truly the best way, in my opinion. I’m so sorry this happened to you and I wish you all the best."
rape,f7zol5b,t3_dy8olu,1574113772.0,This is  rape. You said no. I am so sorry you had to go through this.
mentalhealth,f7zof9d,t3_dy8k46,1574113703.0,"I do this too, not sure what the reason is but I think it’s fairly common? Not sure but I started that recently as well"
energy_work,f7zagub,t1_f7wnt7f,1574107820.0,"It’s very possible! I get frequent panic attacks when I feel “mixed states”, headaches and nausea when im depressed. When im manic I feel high and  sometimes out of body. I have no appetite and endless energy, and when I crash into depression it’s like sucking all the energy out of me. I’m not sure if I answered that properly, I am very out of it right now and it’s hard to get my words right."

rape,f7wulal,t3_dxv9av,1574038471.0,"He is an adult, and you are 15 so yes this is sexual assault. None of what happened is your fault and as hard as it is, you shouldn’t feel guilty or dirty for any of this. It is 100% your decision to report or not, however I do think you should see a therapist if you don’t already. Please please just know that this is not your fault. He is the adult in the situation and should have known better. I know it doesn’t help much to be told this, I went through something similar, but I really do wish you the best. Direct message me if you’d like to talk. You’re not alone in this and you are NOT dirty."
ptsd,f7vvavb,t3_dxnlpe,1574027390.0,I wish you the best!!! it is good to know we’re not alone in this and things get easier eventually :)

bipolar,f7v1kpy,t3_dxqdk2,1574019820.0,"I am only 18 so I can’t speak from experience, however, my cousins wife is nearly 40 with Bipolar 1 and has had a stable job for a year (the longest she’d held a job since she was in her 20s). She’s a wonderful woman, just was extremely out of control when manic, would leave her kids and husband for days and go on drug benders. Then crash for weeks, not eating or leaving bed. This went on for 15 years until about 2 years ago when she attempted suicide for the 3rd time and got serious help. She is really doing wonderful now, especially considering all the traumas she went through. She’s in therapy, working, spending time with her family again, enjoying life, and all around she just made a huge turnaround. I also have bipolar, so we talk about it a lot, and she always says how she never in her life thought she would be okay, but here she is. I’m young and naive but I really do not think any age is too late, personally. I really really wish you the best and hope that someday soon you feel stable and truly happy. ❤️"
bipolar,f7mdlrb,t3_dwvai2,1573860461.0,"I relate to this so much right now. All I can say is just keep seeking inspiration anywhere possible and keep creating, even when you hate it. That’s how I’m trying to cope at least."

InlandEmpire,f7jvthy,t3_dwkgvg,1573787787.0,"Also, any good spots for tagging!! (edit: i can see u guys don’t like that one, im not talking about spray painting on storefronts or anywhere even in the public eye, I’m not an asshole lol. but spray painting in abandoned places/ off railroad tracks isn’t hurting anyone lol.)"
