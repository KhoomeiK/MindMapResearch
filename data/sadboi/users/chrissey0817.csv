Instantregret,eue0zar,t3_cfkby2,1563732535.0,I walked in the kitchen and my step son was trying to mix this in his milk to make “chocolate milk” I said you can drink that but it’s not going to taste how you think lol. He dumped it out.
weddingplanning,ettze8w,t3_cdgeur,1563200358.0,This dress is amazing. I would do an intricate up do with it.
weddingplanning,ets5w3x,t3_cd398h,1563137295.0,Ohh I love this! Great choice. I was thinking about going alone. My appt is on aug 3rd.
weddingplanning,etrc92j,t3_cd1n9d,1563117585.0,Love it! We are having Pie! My fiancé’s favorite thing in the world is pie so why not!
weddingplanning,etoxjcr,t3_ccqmw7,1563040178.0,This is sooo beautiful! Congrats!
bipolar,etodjzp,t3_cchjr4,1563024329.0,I have had all these thoughts in the last 24 hours.
bipolar,etncwai,t3_ccf5y3,1562983424.0,I think I’ve completely forgotten which one I’m suppose to remember.
weddingplanning,etncp2d,t1_etnck01,1562983257.0,I guess I didn’t fully grasp how air tight the if you call it a shower you bring gifts rule was. I’m just trying to have the normal wedding process but like I said since it’s my second time may I have to think a little outside the box.
weddingplanning,etmm7zg,t1_etm5st5,1562963143.0,Thank you! I don’t know what I’m going to do yet. Maybe I’ll just let it go I don’t know. I just wish he was my first than I wouldn’t even have to consider how to handle it. Ugh.
weddingplanning,etml5g2,t1_etmkkf8,1562962432.0,Shower actually in the English language doesn’t mean gifts. You should get yourself a dictionary. Thank you so very much for your advice as it wasn’t even remotely helpful or constructive. If you are interested in having an adult conversation since I’m old enough to be getting married a second time and mature enough to plan a party I’ll be here till that time. Ta Ta for now.
weddingplanning,etm5atc,t1_etm4vvx,1562952354.0,I guess I’m trying to fit what I want into a box it just does not fit into. Don’t want presents. I’m 10 years older than I was the last time I did this and I fought it every step of the way cause I was miserable. I guess I would just like to do it all again because this time it’s right and real. But the past has happened and I can’t change that so this probably isn’t going to follow the normal protocols and norms so I should just adapt. My wedding will literally be all those things. So here’s to a hobo wedding! I really do hope you meant Boho but I’m soooooo calling my wedding a hobo wedding now.
weddingplanning,etm4t5t,t1_etm46xy,1562952055.0,I guess I didn’t explain it right. I’m not looking for gifts. I’m just looking to celebrate my love in a way where we all come together. I’m not asking anyone to get me anything. I’m not even expecting wedding gifts. Also not wearing a white wedding dress. Didn’t wear one to my first wedding. I would like to wear at least a wedding dress. Unfortunately my mother thinks I should order a floral maxi dress from online. Albeit nice. Not exactly what I’m going for.  Oh well. I guess I’ll just see how the next year plays out. Maybe I’ll have a nonbachelorette sorta shindig since there really isn’t any type of description for what I’m looking for.
weddingplanning,etm3qbm,t1_etm3mlo,1562951385.0,Or love but to each their own. It’s up for interpretation.
weddingplanning,etm2pst,t1_etm29or,1562950759.0,My primary motive is not to acquire presents and the whole point of a shower isn’t to get stuff. I want to have a shower because A) it brings all the important women in my life together and B) I was very not presence and engaged at my first one and would like to make that up to my family and friends who participated. Also what exactly is a “hobo themed” wedding? Just curious. I’m having a backyard BBQ wedding at my childhood home. Is that a “hobo themed” wedding?
weddingplanning,etlwego,t1_etlvpu7,1562946815.0,"Valid point.  I’m 32. We do have our own household. Saving for a house. My cousin just got married for the second time and did the whole thing. Bridal shower, bachelorette party, registry(asked for gifts and included a way to give money towards a downpayment on a house). I don’t necessarily need gifts. Most of the stuff I would register for I need before our wedding next year anyway. Loving all this feedback. Thanks!"
weddingplanning,etlsyu5,t1_etlsloh,1562944611.0,"Yeah, I understand what you are saying. I have some other ideas of celebrating this with my people. Doing a painting with a twist with my aunts and close friends. Second weddings are weird and the internet is all over the place with advice. I just want to celebrate this event and not feel weird about it because my first marriage failed. If it didn’t I wouldn’t have found this amazing person. Our wedding is a backyard BBQ at my childhood home so I’m not expecting gifts. I just want an event to bring everyone together."
weddingplanning,etlq9v8,t3_cca77j,1562942890.0,That’s such a cool idea! I always hate that part of a shower. It’s cool for like 5 mins than it loses its luster. This gives each person a special moment. Love it!
mentalhealth,etl7z55,t3_cc5hp6,1562926233.0,First off I am so incredibly sorry this happened to you. If you are in the US report her to the board so they can evaluate her license. Unfortunately it is not illegal and the cops wouldn’t be of much help but you can at the very least start the process to have her credentials removed. Not to many people know they can do that when therapists and other mental health professionals are terrible at their jobs.
onejob,etkeji1,t3_cc3d16,1562895945.0,So one would say their “one job” was accomplished. Just not as efficiently as possible. I once ordered a Halloween costume online and I was shipped an empty mailer bag. Never sealed.
onejob,etke8bq,t3_cc3d16,1562895720.0,But was there a skateboard inside the box!?!?
depression,etjm9o0,t3_cbxfqn,1562876593.0,Amazing! As someone who has had depression her whole life all I will tell you is make a mantra that you tell yourself every day that he is an ally and not the enemy. He might do dumb stuff but he is there for you everyday and he loves you. I have to do this every day. My depression wants to make everyone a villian. It is really hard somedays. Keep pushing. Let him in. It’s ok. We are here for you.
Instantregret,etjlyoi,t3_cbx98u,1562876405.0,At first I didn’t see the car on the shoulder and was like wow that pick up trucks reflexes are on point. I thought the cop was the one going to use the shoulder!😂😂😂
PublicFreakout,etj4kre,t3_cbw6m1,1562866083.0,This really hit my soul. “Are you alright?” Sometimes all you need to hear. This man deserves greatness in his life. I pray she is ok now and they are both living the best life.
bipolar,etiv15f,t3_cbtqc1,1562860431.0,Never read truer words. All I want when I’m manic is to smoke constantly.
bipolar,etgwbxu,t3_cbmwwx,1562800267.0,It’s not on purpose!
bipolar,etg5qf2,t1_etfysqd,1562784341.0,It will never matter if you “warn” them. They have to learn for themselves if they can deal with it or not. 9times out of 10. Not.
depression,etg0ub1,t3_cbhjha,1562781586.0,Making the bed actually helps me a lot! It’s the first thing I do to have a productive day. Sounds real dumb but it works!
depression,etf068i,t3_cba1p7,1562755105.0,I’ve said this to myself everyday for the last 20 years. But I’m never going to stop fighting for myself.
depression,etdyb11,t3_cb5ntg,1562718268.0,I’m 32 and I felt this real deep. I have entered serious I don’t give a fuck mode. I don’t know what to do about it or what to fix first or what the problem even is to fix it. Fuck Depression
relationship_advice,etclax1,t1_etcd3ui,1562687327.0,I just wouldn’t send someone money for a drink on their vaca. I would rather be drinking with them on vaca. Just seems like a weird concept to me.
relationship_advice,etb2opp,t3_carcrz,1562635486.0,I guess I’m super jaded. I would never do this. I guess it’s cute? 😂
bipolar,etavwcq,t3_capjrk,1562630552.0,Shouldn’t there be a “all of the above” answer. Wouldn’t that make more sense?
