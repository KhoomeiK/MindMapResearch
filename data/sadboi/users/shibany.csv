SimsMobile,fr20tmo,t1_fr01n1z,1589829210.0,One if my biggest wishes is that sims mobile would be less rigid with item footprints. Some are ridiculously big or cantankerous for no good reason! And then you have these random problems where we can't even figure out HOW the items overlap. It's frustrating to say the least.
SimsMobile,fr20jzx,t3_glv8ap,1589829087.0,They're so cute! Hope I get one

SimsMobile,fqdycrm,t1_fqdu6x2,1589298714.0,Ah. well then I asuume you have to gather all 5 traits and then retire them...that stinks. I wonder why it forced you to create a sim?
