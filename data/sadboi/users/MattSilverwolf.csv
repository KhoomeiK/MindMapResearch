What happened in the moment was that, I was halfway in lalaland, I saw that Topson was streaming, I didn't recall ever seeing him stream before, I clicked, saw facecam and that he was interacting with chat. The obnoxious stream overlay and what was happening in chat did look suspicious, and there was a distant voice in my head screaming at me that this looks like a classic scam.

But because my brain was half asleep at the time, and because of what happened here on reddit soon after TI8, with Topson supposedly tipping all new posts with his winnings, I subconsciously ignored the screams.

Same thing for when I clicked the spin link and typed in my steam name and password. But because I'm that dumb, I didn't connect two and two together when the ""incorrect username or password"" thing popped up under the steam login, and I immediately went to my Steam app and changed my password and relogged. When I had to verify my email, I didn't even realise that the other thing tried to change my password because the two emails got thrown together.

So I got locked out of my account. To be honest, I think that might actually be exactly what they're counting on, a panicked reaction that overlaps with the scam email.
