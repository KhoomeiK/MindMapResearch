bipolar,f0ln4qp,t3_d5b0dt,1568724044.0,I know what you're saying. My favorite hobby really isnt good for mental health (although I suspect everyone else has varying mental issues that pursue it). I've thought about how its probably not an environment I should seek out yet at the same time feel very comfortable in it. Idk life's wierd.
Standup,f05ee3w,t1_f052dwx,1568407896.0,I'm still waiting to see some of your stand up. C'mon what are you so afraid of?

Standup,f05doao,t1_f00h67c,1568407481.0,"Theres a couple of older guys in my scene and it's great when they come out because thier sets are always different subject matter than a lot of the others do (serial killers, suicide, mental health, tinder). Nothing wrong with those topics just a lot of comics are doing different bits centered around the same topics and it gets draining."

worldnews,ezv8nsy,t1_ezuwywx,1568170152.0,Absolutely. The real trick is the aide we give isreal (wich comes from taxpayers) is given with the stipulation x amount be spent on arms from the us and just like that redistribution of wealth from citizens into the pockest of arms manufacturers.

marvelstudios,exjx2nv,t1_exjovmw,1566363406.0,"Yeah it was certainly fun, but the jokes didnt seem as good as the first one (I really liked hc so big shoes to fill I guess), and I thought Gyllenhal's performance was overhyped going in. Not a bad addition for sure, I think I just (greedily) wanted more I guess."

books,ex2yokt,t1_ex2vfj3,1565977417.0,It is possible for a chain to utilize it's resources to cater to specific markets. Not every store has stock the same selection. Hopefully this is what he means.
news,ewp15kt,t1_ewoo6hz,1565631184.0,Well I think many self identifying liberals are already plenty skeptical of the Clintons. Not sure exactly what it would look like if they as well as many others were implicated
news,ewp0xpk,t1_ewokzzh,1565631048.0,"Curious are they blaming the clintons or see this as a drain the swamp moment? How are people taking Trumps potential involvement (since he himself was voacal about his ""friendship"" with Epstein."
news,ewp0t5l,t1_ewok2d3,1565630970.0,That is interesting. I too find it fishy and would like more info but doubt we'll get much
news,ewojq3c,t1_ewojhb9,1565619746.0,"He's definitely not. Anecdotal, but Ive seen more right leaning people with a ""who cares a pedos dead"" attitude where as most of my left leaning friends want to know the rest. I'm not sure why this is the case since Epstein has ties to prominent members of both parties but its what I've seen so far."

science,ev9q9t2,t1_ev90fgy,1564328533.0,No one has been denied care....and what happens after that. Now picture how many people do not seek medical care when they know they should because of the outcome.
science,ev9pymr,t1_ev9csy1,1564328310.0,"Well we probably would see an immediate increase in hospital visits due to a lot of people putting off care for so long, and that probably should be accounted for (though I don't know how), but that would be an extremely stupid reason to be against single payer."
