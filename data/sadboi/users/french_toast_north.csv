I know it’s permitted in at least one country (Denmark, I think?) where you petition the medical board and if approved euthanasia will be conducted painlessly at a hospital. In these cases my belief is that it’s not a temporary problem.

BPD,fg449b5,t3_ewm1gl,1580495839.0,"I’ve read of 2 different types of typical withholding of information from patients suffering from a mental illness;

1. Misplaced protection-The idea that mentally ill patients are too unstable to know all the information of their condition, and that telling them of their diagnosis might cause additional symptoms if they research the condition, and

2. Infantalization-Mentally ill patients shouldn’t know their condition because doctors tend to view them as needing protection from information, as you would withhold details of a medical condition from a child.


The article I was reading (psychology today I think?) strongly condemned both as essentially withholding medical information from a patient, more so on the psychiatric side, but also included psychologists. There was still some debate as to whether psychologists have to disclose as they are not MD’s, but as they are acting in a very ‘medical’ capacity by giving diagnoses and treatment, I definitely agree with the opinion that it is malpractice to withhold information that the patient/client asks for regarding their own health. This isn’t the 1950’s where those suffering from mental illness are considered sub-human, but the stigma around mental illnesses remains to this day.
Personally, I think knowing a bpd diagnosis is really helpful. You’re able to find a community of support (like this thread), specific information on the condition which can give you concrete goals to work towards with the most effective treatment, hints that you might have comorbid conditions (super common), a sense of relief in knowing that your conditions are relatively common, and knowing that you’re not ‘broken’, just ill.
Plus, I think researching your condition is really important, as only you know the severity of your symptoms, and honestly, professionals get it wrong all the time. Every psych you go to will give you a different answer, so it’s definitely a guess most of the time. There’s a reason you should always get a second (or third!) opinion...


Anyway, welcome to the sub and I hope you feel a sense of relief from knowing a community like you!"

For me, in a moment I can believe that this person has been horrible to me (including family members) but after time passes I realize that I was actually the problem or that what this person did was actually quite normal and it was my reaction that was inappropriate or even abusive."
BPD4BPD,fcw27dd,t3_ej6efp,1578015435.0,"Beautifully said! I’m terrified that there is no real “me” underneath, and then there is no hope because there is no where else to go."
BPD,f42fdpv,t3_dj807n,1571331055.0,Definitely think if she’ll be able to commit to therapy and maybe medication after they’re born - I think it’s been detrimental to my kids as my ability to stay symptom free gets harder as they grow older.
BPD,f2rvnuz,t3_de1jtz,1570376912.0,"You are doing an amazing job. Take care of yourself and your son, but please don’t give up on her unless you just can’t take it anymore. I have been on the other side of the relationship (the one with BPD) and I destroyed my life. My husband gave up and left me and I was utterly devastated. Once the episode was over, I nearly died from the pain of the devastation I caused. What I wouldn’t give to have him still there. My splitting happened about a year after I had a child - I think the hormones messed with the chemicals I needed to stay sane and I broke. After he left, without serious intervention from my family and a hospital stay, I wouldn’t be here today.
Maybe if she stays with treatment she’ll get better and you’ll be the rock she needed to survive.
But...knowing that basically splitting in a relationship usually causes serious emotional abuse (which yours sounds like it’s pretty severe), you are completely justified in leaving. You don’t deserve to be treated this way. You may want to leave for your own well-being.
But...if you still love her, and think you could still love her in the future, stay separated and keep your son away from the abuse, but be there at a distance for her. Let her know you are still there for her. When her episode stops, she’ll still have you and god knows she’ll be beyond grateful forever."
BPD,eycd65c,t3_cwhth9,1567000195.0,"I LOVE my Lamictal. I used to rage a lot but it helped so much to the point where I actually just shrug my shoulders at things that would have previously cause extreme lashing out.
It didn’t really do anything for any of my other symptoms though. And you have to take it EXACTLY as prescribed. You can get a dangerous or fatal rash if you don’t. One time in 3 years I ran out on the weekend and I had to stay in bed because I felt so very wrong, like I could feel my brain radiating from the center. But I take once a day and don’t have any noticeable side effects."
BPD,euh4p4o,t3_cgh0m4,1563820763.0,I think one of the hallmarks that sets BPD apart from the other personality disorders is how so very aware we are that something is wrong and nearly all want to change. She’s definitely getting it confused with other disorders like NPD.
BPD,eto9fzk,t3_ccmlmb,1563019972.0,"Totally normal. For me, some drugs caused vivid dreams that were highly specific to things I’m dealing with in life. Also I was able to pick up dreaming in continuity if I woke up and went back to sleep. Usually these kinds of side effects will go away after a while."
BPD,etnas6n,t3_ccjchq,1562981657.0,Yep! Sometimes I will watch a movie just so I can change the way my personality feels for just a while.
BPD,etnaj1b,t1_etm33gp,1562981444.0,Agreed! Definitely a narcissist- black and white thinking with complete lack of empathy. One of the terrible psychs who leave nothing but damage in their wake.
BPD,etna0i1,t1_etlf6tw,1562981006.0,Don’t give up. Even disordered thoughts are valuable sometimes. I get the stuck and hopeless feelings - I struggle with those constantly. If you didn’t have a diagnosis would you feel any differently?
BPD,etldwcb,t3_cc65qf,1562933322.0,"I think if you didn’t intend to do something “bad” prior to the reaction and it just boiled up out of nowhere, you can definitely count it as the disorder. Like, you didn’t mean to really hurt someone you love, you just needed attention, that’s the disorder. I also think that we’re so conditioned by our disorder that acting out negatively is second nature, so we may do “bad” things because it’s what we’re used to doing. I’m definitely in the same boat - did I mean to cause harm? My feelings of guilt get in the way of objective analysis.
But no matter what, you’re not a “bad” person. Everyone has good in them (except in the really rare instance of pure psychopathy) and does what they think is correct at the time. It’s usually only in hindsight that we realize that the behavior we meant to do one thing (like attention seeking) actually had an effect we didn’t mean.
I think just asking the question “am I bad” means you are not a bad person. If you were, you wouldn’t even ask that question."
BPD,etkdzbl,t3_cbtmdv,1562895541.0,"Yes, me too. 40yo  now and been doing it since 4th grade."
BPD,etkcjpx,t3_cc3r46,1562894511.0,Isn’t enmeshing already a kind of extremely deep attachment? And I call bullshit on the “don’t love” thing. That’s the whole reason most pwBPD attach.
