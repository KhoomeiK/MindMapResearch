Best case scenarios: you find someone you are wildly happy with (which is definitely possible regardless of age!), and are endlessly glad you didn't stay just for convenience. Or, you stay with him and realise you couldn't have been happier with anyone else.

Worst case scenarios: you either decide to chase the butterflies and never catch any, and regret losing him in the process, or you stay with him and always wonder if you could have been happier with someone else.

Just by continuing to treat her like your girlfriend, and suggesting evenings out that are traditional dates in style, you are pushing the boundaries she has given you verbally. You have to go on what she says and not what she does, because what she does can be misunderstood. 

And again, she won't miss you as a partner if she never gets to see what things are like if you're just friends.

It's impossible to tell for sure from such little information but it seems like your relationship is good, and you may just be missing the passion of an early-days relationship. The other things are easy to get around.

Until then, if that happens at all, she has asked to just be friends and you should respect that. Acting like you're still in a relationship doesn't do either of you any favours, it sounds like that's not what she wants now (since she keeps reinforcing the 'as friends' message), and from your perspective she can't realise if she really does still want to be with you if nothing has changed from when you were together.

I think the key thing is that all conversations you have are 100% honest. Don't say you're comfortable with anything if you're really not. Let her know how you feel about her wanting this, and how you feel about the idea itself. If you honestly could be okay with this, but need a little more time - say that.

If she loves you and is as committed to you as you are to her, she will respect your feelings and not do anything, or push to do things, that you aren't comfortable with. If she doesn't, then opening up the relationship probably wouldn't have worked out well for you two anyway."

Could be worth having a word with the parent beforehand and asking them to hang around at the party. They must know there have been problems before and so it isn't unreasonable to expect them to stay in case of trouble. I would frame it less as 'your son sucks and you'll probably have to take him home' and more like 'I know Jerry has been struggling with his behaviour at school and I'd really like to avoid anything like that at Xs party.

Big life changes I can't even think about without freaking. We're currently trying to buy the flat we're already living in and renting, so not much will really change, but I'm crazy anxious over it regardless."
relationships,ev18azr,t3_ci41r5,1564153969.0,"I think that depends on why you broke up. If the issues would still be there, there's no point in trying to rekindle the relationship. 

I know it's hard when you're remembering the good times, but you have to think about the reason(s) you broke up too. Relationships tend to seem perfect in hindsight but it would do a lot of damage to you both to get back together for the wrong reasons and then end up back where you started."
AmItheAsshole,ev16wmb,t3_ci10um,1564153302.0,"Thanks everyone, I responded to the original email to let them know they sent this to the wrong person, and if I haven't had a response by the end of today I'll call them tomorrow.

I forwarded the email to the person who was supposed to receive it too. Haven't heard back from them either but now they know and can complain or move companies if they want."

Anxiety,eudp5yz,t3_cfw29g,1563723835.0,"I had insomnia for close to a year and still struggle to sleep a full night - what helps me is listening to narrated reddit stories on Youtube. It  keeps my mind from racing and stops me from thinking about how much I NEED to fall asleep, so eventually I just drift off. I've also used sleep hypnosis and progressive muscle relaxation for the harder nights.

Hope any of that helps, consistant lack of sleep is devastating."
AmItheAsshole,etwkjcw,t3_cdoj5o,1563274901.0,"NTA and I wish I was as ballsy as you honestly.

 I live on the second floor and 90% of delivery people will call me from the car park outside, or even the road behind my building, and ask me to come outside and get the parcel/food.

When occasionally they do make it upstairs I usually get scolded. I've missed a call once and when the driver arrived at the door he said 'check your phone, go on, I called. I shouldn't have to come up to you'. Another arrived clutching his chest and panting exaggeratedly and said 'if a building doesn't have a lift I usually don't go up stairs'. It's two flights! I do it twice every day and don't go into cardiac arrest! The worst was a guy who called multiple times when I was teaching an online class and then when he came to the door he shouted through my letterbox!

I usually go down when they call but it's infuriating - I pay for delivery to my door, not to outside my building!"
Anxiety,etl3ahh,t3_cby68t,1562919409.0,"Definitely, like  because I'm are aware of it I should be able to stop it.

It's the same as when I know I'm doing something because of anxiety, it feels like I'm using it as an excuse for 'bad' behaviours rather than just the reason for it.

For example when I'm obsessively trying to nail down a plan with my SO for a day that doesn't need a plan at all, I know we don't need to plan and it's anxiety making me try to force one in, so I feel guilty that I still can't stop even though I know that. Don't know if that makes sense to anyone else!"

I'm going to say NAH. I don't think you're an asshole for thinking this way, I think you just don't fully understand her perspective.

It seems to me your wife has justification for being scared and wanting to be prepared. Even if her feelings weren't justified, they should still be respected and not dismissed. I'm not saying what she has proposed is the answer but brushing off how she feels as unreasonable is not the way to go. 

I think you should sit down and talk this through with her. Ask what she is afraid will happen and discuss how likely it seems to both of you, and why you each think it is likely/unlikely. Your ideas of this clearly won't match up but that doesn't make either of you wrong. From there, talk about what would make her feel safer and see if you can find something you can both agree on, but do be prepared to compromise as it is likely to involve time or money.

Maybe you could both take classes together for self-defense - you're spending time together, she feels safer and in control, and it may actually be fun! You could also discuss some cheaper alternatives to make her feel safer, maybe extra locks or a video-feed doorbell for example. You can also set up an emergency feature on some phones that, when activated (mine is by triple-pressing the power button), send a text to a designated emergency contact along with a picture and audio taken at the time. If she has this she may feel safer even when alone. 

Not sure if any of this is useful but I have GAD and after walking in on a man who had broken into my flat, things like this went a long way. My fiancÃ©e being supportive and respecting my fears also meant I recovered a lot faster. It's also worth noting that a lot of my anxieties are completely illogical, but by respecting how I feel regardless of the lack of reason, my fiancÃ©e has helped me make bigger strides than if he had just dismissed my feelings."
AmItheAsshole,errz73p,t3_c3jdqi,1561190753.0,"Perhaps this won't work because of cutural reasons, but if I were in this position rather than going first to proposing marriage for his financial security, I would just see if he would like to date you. I'm assuming here that he isn't aware of your feelings for him, but if he was made aware then there's the possibility he would be interested in you too. 

He may already be aware of your financial situation and this could play a part in his answer, but it seems to me that potentially falling in love through dating each other is a better outcome than putting him in a situation in which he has to choose between love or security. There's certainly a lot less pressure involved in getting to know each other romantically than there is in committing to marriage."
