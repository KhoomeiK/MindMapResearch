My problem is if you scale this down. Make China a single person. For the sake of the argument make this person an embodiment of the stereotype. Make China a person you know in your life, maybe a member of your peer group. You may even know someone like this, a compulsive liar, a machiavellian cheat, an egotistical narcissist. How does this person's life play out? 

Say they brag about being incredibly wealthy, everyone knows they aren't actually wealthy so they encourage that person to buy dinner for everyone because they're so wealthy after all, China manages to back out of this somehow and talk his way out of paying the bill while somehow keeping face. 

Next time China brags about being incredibly strong, so one day when a tree falls on a child the people ask China to help them move the tree because China is so strong. But China can't actually move the tree, but people have bought the lie, they really believe China could move the tree if it wished. But it doesn't, it lets the child die.

Time goes on, people start noticing, that China seems to be saying one thing and doing another. You see where this is going? It it doesn't matter if they believe China or not, the truth is still the truth.
Eventually the people will either think China is lying, or they will think China is telling the truth but indifferent to their suffering. Its a losing strategy for a successful government, the lifespan of which is only as long as you can keep up the lies you have to juggle, and as time goes on the lies pile up and you can't keep all the balls in the air.

China,fmukgow,t1_fmu3gnt,1586393172.0,"Yeah the numbers are there for this theory but I just don't buy it. I apply the same thoughts to Muslims also. Yes I understand how a handful of bad actors could tarnish the name of an entire group, no I don't believe all Muslims are terrorist, but I also know that most Muslims do believe and agree that men are in charge of women in the household. That women should veil themselves. That homosexuality is wrong. That non believers are in someway less than true Muslims. So yes sometimes stereotypes arise from the actions of a few bad actors, but sometimes they're just true and taken from the lived experiences of people who have interacted with these people on average over the course of time. Like the idea that all dogs like pets. Sure there are dogs that don't like pets, but over time people have observed that dogs enjoy it when you pet them. It goes both ways."

I understand why they do it and I don't even think they're wrong for doing it, I would probably do the same.

You are not losing money or missing opportunities, you are just acting like an adult and doing what you KNOW is right. Those opportunities never existed within a moral world. If everyone cheats it's impossible to contain, it's just the status quo.

I've definitely been ripped off by sneaky convenience store owners who definitely had no problem over charging a kid because he's white, or expecting a 9 year old to know how to haggle. We would actually call it white tax and we'd expect to pay it at certain stores because we just didn't haggle, here you just pay what they tell you it costs.

I guess I just want people to realize and confirm that I have the right of the situation and that China would be better if it were more like Canada. But winning here would probably look a lot more like letting Countries govern how they want to govern. Things just get so tricky around imposing our moral standards on other parts of the world but I'm actually really ok with it. Sam Harris had a line about a society that gouged out the eyes of a second born child for religious purposes, that surely we could place moral judgments on such a society and that we would be sure of our moral RIGHT. That we had correctly determined a moral truth that needlessly gouging out the eyes of infants is a ""bad thing"". I think you can do the same for other societies so long as you're just as sure."

Why do you see other regimes toppled so regularly but China seems to keep a firm grip? What makes them unique? How can they be so developed industrially but so far behind sociately? Also am I wrong?

China,fmrnyml,t1_fmrjejg,1586329240.0,"I hear you. I see a lot of people blaming the bad actions of Korean, or Thai people with the broad brush of, ""ahhh probably Chinese..."" and that isn't fair. But the stereotype of, ""chinese bad"" didn't come from misidentified Thai people scratching their nuts on a bus. It came from decades of demonstrable dishonest behavior from chinese people, chinese government, Chinese corporations, chinese hotel staff, taxi drivers, sales clerks, people born and raised in China who for whatever reason (be it fear of persecution or scarcity, or just plain old complacency), condone the actions of their government. The stereotype is projected onto the Thai guy because he matches up with what people have learnt are chinese stereotypes. 

This might put you at ease though, cause I'll tell you right now, as far as Canadians go, I'm sitting at about a 7.5 on the ignorant scale and even I don't hold the view that ALL CHINESE,  anything. And I very much understand that Asia is a big place and people are shitty everywhere. Most people have at least a minimal understanding of the situation and anyone claiming guilt by heredity can be written off as just plain old racist. So no, most people, even ones like me who would love to just blame ALL Chinese, understand there is a huge difference between a CCP Loyalist and a persecuted liberal chinese youth. But, honestly, this isn't even about Corona, the CCP or exams, it's about online gaming. There is a huge population of chinese gamers who purposely ruin games that westerners enjoy. I think it has been nearly every game I've ever played, not just shooters either. Big groups of Chinese men will goto cafes where the cheats are already installed on the computers and they will stream on Twitch with headlines like, ""pissing off westerners for donations"". It isn't about scarcity, or money, or government control, they aren't dealing with societal pressures to be good at video games, they just want to piss people off, preferably westerners. Can you think of anything the west does to China? 

Because as is, for me here, 

I try to go outside, Chinese have unleashed their yearly pandemic upon the world, lied about it, and now we all must self quarantine while our grandmas die. 

I'm bored and stuck inside so I play some video games, I spend 45 mins working my way up to 8th place only to have some hacker kill me from across the map, happens all night and eventually I give up and go to bed. 

I lay down to sleep, I get a robo call from the same Chinese caller at 3 in the fucking morning, everyday, its to the point where I don't even answer the phone if the number isn't saved in my phonebook, but that doesn't stop them from calling me every fucking day.  

like at what point do I stop making excuses for their shit behaviour? Am I to assume Chinese people are over there dealing with Canadian scam calls? Canadian hackers? Canadian pandemics. I'm done. Im fucking done with that shit hole country. I can't think of a single positive Chinese contribution to the world. All I hear is organ harvesting, hackers, cheaters, scammer, shitty tourists, rude, greedy.

Not scarcity or an overly competitive environment, none of these things are excuses. At some point you have to take responsibility for your actions. At some point your countrymen have to take responsibility for their governance.

The fact that the government is acting with impunity shows two things, yes, an authoritarian level of control, but also a complacency in the people that allows for such things to continue. This government represents you whether you like it or not, it is your responsibility as a people to overthrow your tyrannical government if you are truely victims of it. I'm sorry but no, I wasn't putting the responsibility soley on the government, I'm also accusing the Chinese people."

The country and its people are the most shamelessly immoral and dishonest people on the planet. They resent western people for holding these views, call them racist, justifying their immoral behavior, and continue on with their shitty behavior. 

Someone should be along shortly to call me racist and explain how the government is really at fault, or how they're just victims of scarcity or an overly competitive environment.

It didn't make me move away from it, until I embraced it. Like you said, I had to embrace the mundane to enjoy the adventure. 

I never went back to salvia but I got busy living my life as a physical person. I stopped being a hippie and started being responsible. 
I made a lot of money, closed off my heart and become self interested. Probably not what you'd expext to hear but that's what happened. I embraced and accepted the mundane world, and I thrived. I'm kinda curious what it would be like to go back ten years later."

Salvia,fkpwfde,t1_fkpfgzt,1584421480.0,"Ok cool. Have you fucked with any other psychodelics? What you're describing is pretty standard and yeah I'm familiar with it. I usually only get that feeling from the first few times doing a new drug. Some drugs are more predictable than others but for me salvia was the most consistent. with any other drugs I could always expect something new that would catch me off guard. With salvia it was like clockwork. I'd sit, hoot, hold, feel a chill, hit, hold, exhale. Then, as reliable as anything, over a hundred trips, I'd feel like a cold metallic liquid ooze out of my orifices, sometimes it was visible if I was high enough before lights out. That ooze would creep over my body until it consumed me, then I was sink slowly at first but with increasing speed thru my couch or whatever surface I was sitting on and my vision would get smaller and smaller to a single point as the scene I left back on earth got further and further away from me. I would sink, but with resistance, like I was being pulled thru an elastic membrane that would eventually ""pop"" and release me into a free fall. Its pitch black here and I come to a float above a large leather bound book, slightly redish rusty brown with gilded golden corner covers and latches. If I open the book it swings widely open and grows as the cover swings open encompassing my entire field of view. Its now a landscape of pages beneath me, the pages turn with the speed of flying over them and their images project a kind of blurry flip book affect. I can tumble into the pages and I'll be in my own life, interacting with myself and the people in my lived experiences as they happened in real life. I can leave the book at any time but if I ""fly forward"" I can no longer progress the story and when I dive into the pages there's people there but they're barely human and I don't know them and they don't know me. I spend the rest of my trip trying to find my book."

You've certainly uncovered the mechanism, but why is the object so commonly a book? Not just any book but a very specific type of book. It isn't a modern hardcover like you'd find in a book store, it isn't a children's pop up or colouring book. Its an old ass leather bound book with thick off-white pages and gilded lettering. 

It's either a much older part of your brain that is choosing a placeholder object and projecting that object as a physical representation of time ( which I was perfectly fine with for the last 10 years but recently I felt it required closer examination.) Or there is another realm where the entirety of our lived experience is somehow contained within an all too literal piece of ethereal literature. If you let your imagination run wild you could imagine that our lives are nothing but works of fiction, scribbled down by some otherworldly author to amuse their self and their peers."

I actually never did salvia again, however I continued my exploration with DMT and sensory deprivation, which I found to be all around more enjoyable.

Salvia exposes the mechanism, or draws it into our awareness, I'm hesitant to call it our consciousness or even unconscious, but we become aware of this mechanism, correct? 

And then the most common representation we apply to it, is that of a book because it's so ingrained in our genetic history? Or what? Like why not a movie, why some dusty ass looking Harry Potter style book. Were there just that many people in my genetic past reading dusty old books? I've heard other people have similar but different experiences so I'm not opposed to the idea that it's just a placeholder and different people use different placeholders for the same mechanism.
