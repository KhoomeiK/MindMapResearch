i recommend going and visiting first. it’s good to see the areas for yourself and decide which one would work for you. are you moving for any particular reason? school, work, friends that kind of thing? if you are then it’s best to be as close as possible to one of them. last year in my hometown it was an hours drive to university, and now i live across the road which was great for the 6 weeks uni was actually open ahaha

definitely get somewhere with roommates first. all roommates are different obviously, but mine have been really friendly and have taken me to lots of places i wouldn’t otherwise have known about

are you working at the moment? it’s best to save up at least 5 grand because of the cost of moving and in case you haven’t got a job. if you’re working at a franchise or a chain store right now you can ask for a transfer. hope this helps!"
