endometriosis,fopoi4i,t1_foowycc,1587967185.0,"Yes it has! Not like 💯 because my endo is severe but when you educate yourself on inflammation and how your diet can cause flares, it totally makes sense with endo.

So I dove in pretty quick. Plant based is technically vegan eating but the study required us to cut out refined sugar as well. Sorry if I’m rambling lol I had no clue how much sugar effected my body until I cut it out. Because as soon as I would eat a cookie or add cheese or whatever to my food my pelvic pain was soooo bad. So it’s really hard but process of elimination. Once you cut out animal based foods (includes eggs etc.) and sugar. Whatever makes you feel like shit and causes a flare up is the food that causes inflammation for YOU.

There are anti inflammatory diets and foods known to “cause it” but not everyone is affected the same. I probably explained this horribly lol. I actually have pdf info they gave us if you dm me I’ll email it to you."

Bummed for you, living with endo really sucks. I use vaginal Valium inserts as well for spasms... for the pelvic pain I prefer Percocet... not easy to get but very helpful for me.

mentalillness,fnayg1z,t3_g0obr6,1586806031.0,"First off. No enemy feelings here dude. I suffer from Bi Polar1, severe anxiety, and ptsd. I was with my last bf for over 3 years and he eventually ended it.... 

Reflecting... and it took months! Hospitalized and over 4 months IOP to come to the conclusion I was WRONG. You can’t blame everything on your disorder and not bend. Although my emotions are intense and extreme I have the power to use tools to make life manageable. I am now medication compliant, I sleep now (with sleep med but still it’s a plus) I’ve always exercised and ate well but I started to meditate. Self care is essential.

Treatment is great yes but support groups are helpful as well... even for both of you. It’s important for her to understand although she’s suffering from this you shouldn’t have too as well. It is your choice to stay and support her. I recommend she takes responsibility for taking care of herself and doing everything she possibly can to bring her best into your relationship. Hope that helps a little. I learned a lot from what I lost, hopefully she doesn’t have to learn the same way."

mentalillness,fn7156c,t3_g007pz,1586711272.0,You can take the referral and make the appointment to see the psychiatrist. Technically that’s all you needed to move forward.

Late bloomer. Period at 17 a couple times a year- very light, lasted around three days)
Periods were so inconsistent I thought I’d get the shot for BC and for it to completely go away.
By my early 20s I had pelvic pain. Severe pelvic floor muscle spasms. Painful bowel movements and weird urinary stuff. Like I could barely hold my urine and if I tried it was super painful. Also the frequency is quite embarrassing.
Anywho, first lap around 25yrs old, doc found nothing. Everything got persistently worse AND painful sex. 
Fast forward to 30yrs old. Had another lap- doc found endo tissue on my uterus, ovaries, rectum, and removed my appendix( found endo there) They inserted the IUD (still no period) 
The quality of my life was great everything was better until around 32 all the pain and symptoms came back... with a vengeance!
I stopped working, I use vaginal suppositorys, pain killers, changed my diet to plant based (anti inflammatory)
I’m 34 yrs old now... don’t even consider periods as a part of my life but all other symptoms very severe. It’s really debilitating. 
I wish you the best 🤪"

You might want to track your symptoms. Maybe a list of very specific things. Like, what activities make pain worse, level of pain, how it’s effecting the quality of your life. 

I just finished a study for endo women and how inflammation worsens symptoms. I was on a plant based diet for 90 days... it’s helped quit a bit. I’ve continued the diet. Look into other options as well."
