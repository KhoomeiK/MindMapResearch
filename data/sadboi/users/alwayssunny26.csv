I feel like your heart is in the right place. You want them to feel better and you‚Äôre trying to encourage healthy behaviors. But this sounds like a depression honestly. Before the gym, I‚Äôd suggest therapy. When the mental health gets better, maybe it‚Äôll be easier for them to get to the gym.

If you feel fine and don‚Äôt have any noticeable medical issues, I can understand why you wouldn‚Äôt want to go to the doctor. But yearly checkups are important, especially as you get older.

It seems you are using food to cope, and it seems like you know that. 

Firstly I would only keep healthy things around the house that you‚Äôre not tempted to binge on. Fruits vegetables proteins. The whole lot. Second, when you want to binge, instead of impulsively buying that food, make a pros and cons list. Ex: pro I love the food I‚Äôm eating, con I feel terrible after. It may help you resist the urge. Third, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt let yourself be hungry. If you‚Äôre hungry you‚Äôre more tempted to binge. Eat enough food during the day and give yourself a good amount of fuel. 

Again take everything I say with a grain of salt because I am by no means a professional. But I hope this helps some."
