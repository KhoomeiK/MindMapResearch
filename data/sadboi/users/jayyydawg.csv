AnxietyDepression,fp7odu7,t3_gboo9b,1588374496.0,My sister didn’t fully understand until I ended up in the hospital and that had to keep me there for a couple days because I was so anxious that I was throwing up and wasn’t eating. Since then she watched videos online of people sharing their experience living with anxiety and she became a lot more understanding. I guess since she was able to see that I wasn’t the only one like this that I’m not overreacting for no reason. My best advice is to show them resources that will educate them on anxiety.

Like your wife when I’m manic I tend to shop a lot which in the past has affected my financial situation. But other than that I’ve been in therapy basically my whole life and on and off meds since I was 13. When I’m off me meds it gets really bad, I’ll probably have a months long depression episode. I took a long time for me to realize that I need those meds to live a normal life and that when I start to feel better not to stop the meds because they are the reason I feel better. My father also has bipolar II and his symptoms are much worse than my. I also think uses alcohol to cope with his symptoms rather than going to a doctor. Because of I now see how hard it is from an outside perspective."
