We have both worked on understanding when I don't want to or need some more time to feel safe. My advice to you is to always check in with yourself to figure out what you want. Tell your boyfriend to always ask you before sex as well"

- Use some extra time to do things like showering and brushing your teeth
- Rub cream over big parts of your body, this gives you a moment to care for and be intimate with your body in a positive way as well as give you a reason to move around for a bit
- Listen to some music that fits with your feelings, then move over to more happy and lighter tones if that feels natural 
- Write down how you feel and don't hold anything back 
- Find at least three things you're thankful for and keep that with you through the day or night, it might help to write them down"

If you think you like him like that you could see how it goes without any alcohol and away from a party. Wait with anything sexual until you feel safe and ready, and don't do anything with him you feel uncomfortable with. A month is not a long time and this will probably take a lot of work to get through, I'm sure you'll come out of this eventually.
