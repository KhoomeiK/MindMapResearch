Psychiatry,fl02e62,t1_fkx2uf0,1584688737.0,This is true.
Psychiatry,fl02dpg,t1_fkxomko,1584688722.0,Oh wow two weeks already. We just wrapped up this week as week one
depression,fizl3q5,t1_fizjf92,1582865842.0,Thanks. I‚Äôm like she‚Äôs trying to overcome 26 years of being emotionally unavailable so I don‚Äôt know how long that will take and how much time I have
depression,fizl1ho,t1_fizkxbv,1582865790.0,Yeah she said we‚Äôd talk about other stuff first and then come back to it. But I can talk about my childhood all day. But once it comes to a certain event I shut down and I don‚Äôt know how not to
depression,fizj5r0,t1_fiziyrr,1582864259.0,I think it‚Äôs more of a me problem. I don‚Äôt open up to anyone and I have a good psychiatrist now. But I can‚Äôt get sentences to form

medical,fi2cdgt,t1_fi2c431,1582076483.0,I‚Äôm not a dr but I know one sided throat pain is frequently caused by acid. Especially if it‚Äôs the side you sleep on

depression,fhzj35n,t1_fhz9zgc,1582000921.0,That's good to know. I feel like I'm going crazy with this repeating memory basically on loop. And it's not even a very long one so the replay is kind of intense. It's good to know I'm not the only one the repeating memories has happened to though!
depression,fhz9t4v,t1_fhz482f,1581994170.0,"Yeah, I‚Äôm doing therapy too. Not sure what kind but this anxiety just came out of nowhere with one particular memory replaying over and over again"
depression,fhz9pqv,t1_fhz7x07,1581994105.0,"Thanks for the info. I hated the numb feeling I was feeling before, but I‚Äôm feeling way too much right now so I think that would be much more manageable. I‚Äôll try the 1 for now and see if I notice an effect"
depression,fhz6vk8,t1_fhz3yp8,1581992230.0,Did you feel a big difference when you‚Äôd double the dose? Did you take two tabs at once?
depression,fhz6sxi,t1_fhz3yp8,1581992183.0,"Yeah, I just need to calm down a bit. My feeling brain is going amuck. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm anxious and I‚Äôve never had a panic attack but I feel like my heart is racing, it‚Äôs heard to breathe, and feels like someone is crushing my chest. But I‚Äôm definitely not having a heart attack lol"
depression,fhz6nng,t1_fhz3ojq,1581992088.0,What dose were you taking?
ADHD,fbqscx4,t1_fbqm4kl,1577035094.0,Also found it on Libby! I‚Äôd check out that app if you don‚Äôt have it already
ADHD,fbqs9o1,t1_fbqm4kl,1577035055.0,"Yeah, I‚Äôm a champion compartmentalizer. Or at least I was. And I can‚Äôt ignore it with her because she just keeps saying I need to open up and it‚Äôs awkward."
ADHD,fbqjrw5,t1_fbq60kd,1577032471.0,"Yeah, my psychiatrist keeps trying to get me to talk about it and I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve also read about it and it used to be common belief that to get over trauma you needed to go over every detail of it, like exposure therapy. But we now know that‚Äôs not always helpful but not all therapists seem to know this. And I can‚Äôt keep divulging my past to try and find someone who knows this and keeps up to date on evidence-based methods. I like what you said about closing the holes. It‚Äôs kind of like not ‚Äúgetting over it‚Äù but learning to live with it"
ADHD,fbqiii9,t1_fbp93j2,1577032065.0,"Thanks. I don‚Äôt have the energy anymore. It‚Äôs also a combination of all that I mentioned, plus learning that the views I have about the world aren‚Äôt super common or prioritized by most. Without getting into it, it‚Äôs not just me being negative and thinking this. It‚Äôs legitimately true. It‚Äôs kind of an existential crisis thrown in, but I‚Äôve already come up with my answers to the usual questions. I just can‚Äôt reconcile my answers with my lack motivation to pursue change because I feel so depressed. And if I can‚Äôt get over this then what‚Äôs the point? I‚Äôm not really helping others and I‚Äôm not happy, so why keep going?"
ADHD,fbqgxhv,t1_fboikx2,1577031539.0,Ah man that sucks. I think I developed some okay coping strategies for ADHD in some aspects. But the avoidant one for the trauma is something that‚Äôs not working so well now
ADHD,fbnozsl,t1_fbnopue,1577001091.0,Maybe they will understand but none of them have any of these disorders. I just have too much that makes me unique and it‚Äôs so isolating
ADHD,fbg1o42,t1_fbfz3f7,1576829912.0,"Yeah, I was thinking maybe more people with ADHD would find it more on the drowsy side than neurotypicals. Like- since Adderall helps me focus and chill me out, another more commonly activating med (Prozac) for normal people would have the opposite effect for me"
ADHD,f6jrrcx,t3_drjr36,1572899236.0,That‚Äôs awesome! Maybe you can try and move up or try something new that challenges you? I‚Äôve brushed off so many potential jobs or career options because I felt I couldn‚Äôt perform consistently. If you‚Äôre doing well try moving closer to your dreams? Or dare to dream bigger?
ADHD,f6jqsfr,t3_drmjml,1572898814.0,"Yes! I feel this all the time. I was diagnosed at the beginning of the year and it‚Äôs hard. I feel like part of it is the stigma and part of it is because it‚Äôs hard to differentiate what are symptoms and what are personality flaws or traits.
Then I tried medication and the first one didn‚Äôt do anything so I doubted myself more because if I did have it medication works for like 80-90% of us. So I tired another and it kind of worked. And a third and it really worked! So having meds work paradoxically helped me solidify that it wasn‚Äôt just made up, that there really was a biological imbalance. Buuutt of medication didn‚Äôt work for me at all I‚Äôm sure the doubts would still be pretty big.
I think that to some extent doubt is good because you want to make sure you have the diagnosis right. There are lots of other things that could cause these symptoms so making sure you were assessed by someone who knows ADHD and other conditions is important. If that has happened then I suggest you read Delivered from Distraction as it has given me much more insight into why I am the way I am. I still struggle but knowing there are other people who have ADHD and are just like me helps me not doubt myself. Also self doubt seems to be pretty common in us ADHDers because of a lifetime of doubting our abilities"
ADHD,f5uxd8z,t1_f5ugl58,1572480709.0,"Yeah, people often suggest taking big things and breaking them down into small actionable tasks. Depending on what you‚Äôre working toward it can be specific or room for adjustment.

And yeah I‚Äôm trying to find a medication that helps with core symptoms so that I‚Äôm not losing my train of thought in interviews and that kind of thing where I can‚Äôt use tools to help me compensate. It‚Äôs been an adventure so far"
ADHD,f5ufk5u,t3_dparna,1572472492.0,Omg I feel like I wrote this. I feel this too relatable. I just recently bought an iPad and try and use that to motivate me to stay organized and complete tasks. I use the app Good Notes and it‚Äôs so fun! It also helps me study cause I like to make the notes pretty and I can take them faster than writing in a notebook. I‚Äôve yet to figure out what‚Äôs reasonable to expect for ADHD. I have big goals too but with that there are bigger expectations and less room for error usually
ADHD,f5s7l6v,t1_f5s77fe,1572415256.0,"That one has also been suggested to me. I‚Äôm trying not to read too much about it now though because I don‚Äôt want to ruminate over it. I‚Äôm also interested in lots of other things and I‚Äôm trying to learn about those because that can actually be helpful for a career or figuring a better one out. Interested in neuroscience right now and learning how neurotransmitters work and connecting that to my symptoms makes it super easy to remember and understand if you can‚Äôt stay away from at least kind of analyzing yourself like me, that is a fun thing to fall down a rabbit hole of"
ADHD,f5s6wzr,t3_dp2h57,1572414387.0,"Yeah, ADHD is often comorbid with other conditions. Also, depression and other issues can cause similar symptoms and they need to tease them out to correctly diagnose you. I ‚Äústressed‚Äù when I did the don‚Äôt hit X test and was almost laughing because I was so bad at it and kept trying to predict the next letter and would be wrong because the system was designed to trick you especially if you‚Äôre ADHD. It was comical to see how many errors I made and interesting to analyze the data. ADHD on those tests have pretty specific ranges or patterns so you can tell if someone is faking too which is so cool to read about. Anyway that was a tangent. Getting diagnosed with anything isn‚Äôt a joyful experience but at least you then have a name for what‚Äôs going wrong and a huge framework of how to make it better because tons of other people have been there. My psychologist recommended Driven to Distraction and it‚Äôs really great. It helped me learned some things about myself, why certain things happened, and gave me encouragement that there are Dr‚Äôs who have this condition and many other wildly successful people, besides actors (thanks google üôÑ), who have ADHD. I would recommend getting in a better frame of mind before reading it otherwise it could also turn into a bit of a pity party during some chapters (at least for me). Or if you don‚Äôt have ADHD then the book won‚Äôt be as helpful either and there I‚Äôm sure are other books for whatever you have"
ADHD,f5s5q31,t1_f5rz6ca,1572412935.0,"Yeah, I feel like that makes sense for psychologist or therapists but not psychiatrists who are transitioning away from psychotherapy and isn‚Äôt even trained in most med schools now."
ADHD,f5s5ob0,t1_f5s1yd1,1572412877.0,"I‚Äôd rather have my psychiatrist be on the dull/cold side. It can make it easier to share symptoms if they aren‚Äôt empathetic and feeling bad for you. And yeah, I‚Äôm just assuming a lot out of the interaction and overanalyzing it. But the bottom line was it was uncomfortable and it shouldn‚Äôt have been for whatever reason whether my fault or his and should this be brought up to help with his medical education"
ADHD,f5s5dfs,t1_f5s126y,1572412527.0,Yes! Maybe not manipulative on purpose but not helpful given the situation. And it made me kind of not want to go back and just do my other stuff on my own
ADHD,f5s5860,t1_f5rntvp,1572412357.0,Hahahaha this is so great üòÇ
ADHD,f5s55a2,t1_f5rnpuk,1572412268.0,"That‚Äôs kind of what I thought, the bigger picture. Not so much our relationship but future patients and medicine in general. And yeah they do but all of that goes in your chart for all to see, so I‚Äôd probably mention something in person discreetly."
ADHD,f5s52pw,t1_f5rpvza,1572412190.0,"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs bad just maybe having a bad day and this year is his first year of having patients of his own (with an attending) and not observing. And then I overanalyze more haha and think about past research I‚Äôve done and how it shows that sometimes forcing patients to talk about trauma when they‚Äôre not comfortable and don‚Äôt feel in control can retraumatize them, which is not good. That‚Äôs not me and I‚Äôm fine, but then I‚Äôm like he should know this!"
ADHD,f5s4iwr,t1_f5rpt4l,1572411600.0,Haha I didn‚Äôt even think of the whole interpretation of trying to cure it. But I‚Äôm like I‚Äôm only going to see him a couple more times for med management and then transition back to my PCP and therapist. I just get all existential and think about how everything has an impact and me speaking up could help him be better Dr but them I‚Äôm like who really cares
ADHD,f5s41c6,t1_f5rhq3e,1572411080.0,"I get what you‚Äôre saying, but this was mostly just me venting about probably an annoying miscommunication and indecision over if I want to tell my psychiatrist how I felt and help him be more aware and sensitive in the future. I don‚Äôt think that my reluctance to share a specific traumatic event with a resident psychiatrist (whose specialty is not therapy) is indicative of if I am trying or not. Maybe I‚Äôm not trying, but we haven‚Äôt discussed other areas of my life very much to provide that evidence, mostly just discussed symptoms and feelings associated with them until this second meeting. So it‚Äôs not a fair judgement/comment to make, in my opinion, and it can be mildly damaging to those who are are trying to seek help. If we had a rapport, rather than 15 min med check meetings, and this psychiatrist had more insight into who I am as a person rather than my chart with my weight, height, diagnoses, medications, etc it would make more sense to push people and say these things. He was chill the last time we met, so I feel like he was just in a bad mood and I irritated him by not feeling comfortable sharing"
ADHD,f5s0h2r,t3_doyt9s,1572407730.0,"I feel like some context is missing here. He told me he thought I wasn‚Äôt trying to get better (ADHD and depression) after I was unwilling to share a trauma that I had talked to a psychologist about and was mentioned (without detail) in my chart. I explained I didn‚Äôt want to go into detail, but the event definitely catalyzed the depression I‚Äôm feeling now and made it harder for me to laugh at my ADHD like I did before because it changed how I viewed myself as a person. He kept pushing for me to talk about it and I said no it was hard to even make the words come together. Then he said ‚Äúokay, but I feel like you‚Äôre not really trying to make them or get better.‚Äù It‚Äôs not a huge deal, I was mostly just venting on Reddit cause it made me sad to have another person tell me this who knows very little about me since we‚Äôve only met a couple times. I‚Äôm a little torn on having our next meeting and being like ‚Äúhey just a heads up my feelings were kind of hurt when you said this because it‚Äôs something everyone with ADHD hears all the time and it was already a big step for me to finally make these appointments and admit I was struggling with some symptoms enough to get medication. So just letting you know for future patients.‚Äù But another part of me thinks he‚Äôll just blow it off and that‚Äôs fine we‚Äôll just keep titrating some meds and whatever. And another part is annoyed because he‚Äôs asking about things that I talk to other members of my care team and people about and I feel like he‚Äôs overstepping his psychiatry lines when I‚Äôve already told him things that are medically necessary and have no issue talking about symptoms. I just don‚Äôt want him to think I‚Äôm not trying because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable baring my soul to him personally, which I get the feeling he took personally, but maybe not. I‚Äôm just overanalyzing this now haha. It‚Äôs just me being caught in do I want to feel uncomfortable bringing it up to help him be a better provider for future people when he might not care?"
ADHD,f5rp6gq,t1_f5rhdyn,1572399649.0,"He‚Äôs actually a really nice dude. I felt like he was annoyed as to why I was not giving him details of a trauma I experienced, which I explained catalyze some depressive symptoms. But in my head I was like ‚Äúdude I don‚Äôt know you. We just met. It‚Äôs hard for me to talk about things, like the words literally don‚Äôt come out or do and don‚Äôt make sense. And also I don‚Äôt want this in my med rec.‚Äù And his response to me not wanting to open up about it to him made him think I wasn‚Äôt trying to open up and therefore not get better. Because that‚Äôs required for getting better? Therapy with a psychiatrist who didn‚Äôt study psychology? It just hurt my feelings in the moment and annoyed me"
depression,f4js570,t3_dkqjae,1571625273.0,That‚Äôs amazing! One of my friends lost a lot of weight and she said sometimes she needed to take a step back and think to her heaviest and how her mind frame at the time was so different. She struggled to imagine losing 20 pounds and now she‚Äôs down 90! 12 months ago did you ever think you‚Äôd be here?
depression,f4jrofg,t3_dks9mq,1571625021.0,Are you me haha? I‚Äôve been slipping into a deep depression and fighting with what I imagine as my logical and depressed brain. I‚Äôm usually very analytical but the more I spiral the more illogical I feel the conclusions I come to are
medical,ey33za2,t1_ey324zn,1566754800.0,"Yeah, from what I‚Äôve researched too you would usually want to treat the ADHD first since the depression can be secondary. Unless the depression is really bad then it may be beneficial to stabilize their mood first. But since similar monoamines are affected I wonder when one would work better than the other or what the affect would be or usually is since there‚Äôs not tons of research"
medical,ey30jcg,t1_ey2f87v,1566752464.0,So if you have ADHD and are taking Wellbutrin do you think it would take even longer to work for depression? Or maybe not at all unless you were also taking an ADHD too?
medical,excds1w,t1_exbcde8,1566148366.0,"Yeah, I was really hoping motivation would improve so that I could get things done that I know would make me feel better. But still kind of waiting/trying until it does"
medical,excdlmo,t1_exbvsf8,1566148242.0,"Yeah, I tell myself that too. I just don‚Äôt want to go in to talk about my feelings and continue the same med to see if it works"
medical,ex9wvme,t1_ex9nc69,1566095591.0,"Yeah, I‚Äôm on bupropion but it‚Äôs supposed to have less side effects than other antidepressants. I am on week two and I am waiting until week 4 when I go back for my f/u. I do have more suicidal thoughts than when I first went to the Dr and was prescribed the meds, but I feel like it‚Äôs just part the spiral I was on that caused me to go to the Dr a few weeks ago. Probably not a side effect or reason to go in"
medical,ex9wa6m,t1_ex9hbdd,1566095320.0,I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs due to the medication but yeah I am feeling worse and thinking about suicide more (I‚Äôm not planning on it though). But if every depressed person came back in when they felt worse that seems like a lot of unnecessary visits unless they‚Äôre thinking of actually committing suicide
mentalhealth,evik5cq,t1_evdyebn,1564544025.0,"Sort of confusing. I stopped taking the other medications so this is the only one I am taking now. My Dr and I talked over the list of side effects, I'm just trying to time starting the meds with my life"
mentalhealth,evbjoy4,t1_evbigsn,1564380109.0,"I have no appetite from depression and I think starting Wellbutrin without eating probably didn't help the nausea I experienced as a side effect, as you mentioned an empty stomach seemed to make you feel worse."

But I also have a trail race on August 10th. Have you ever skipped doses and avoided the nausea? I'm hoping that if the nausea continues to race day I may try to skip the one day so I can do the race as it's been a goal for a long time."

ADHD,eu57zga,t1_eu3tnq0,1563471825.0,"Yes! I have ADHD and am highly motivated/ambitious, but I mostly struggle because it takes me sooo long to get anything accomplished even if I sit down and force myself to do it because I get so distracted and forgetful. Then I get tired of feeling like I‚Äôm wasting time because it should have only taken 15 min not 3 hours. But I was more so trying to start a discussion because I see people saying their meds don‚Äôt work because it doesn‚Äôt give them motivation. But if my meds ‚Äúgave‚Äù me motivation I feel like I would be way too psyched and probably on too high a dose. But I didn‚Äôt know if that was just my experience or interpretation"
medical,etqhext,t1_etmnjmv,1563085160.0,"Yeah, I guess what I mean is that I feel guilty wanting to go back to her. I feel comfortable with her but it would probably be better for me to find someone more long term rather than the clinic I go to. It is her job but I don‚Äôt think her role is meant for doing long term therapy but rather providing short term or diagnoses.

Showerthoughts,etkqjkx,t3_cc1rk9,1562905356.0,"I guess that depends on how you measure intelligence. Just because someone has a lot of degrees doesn‚Äôt make them smarter than someone else.

But the ones that involve the people they are trying to help, who are usually not ‚Äúwell educated,‚Äù have a greater success rate."
birthcontrol,etkne6i,t1_etje2uq,1562902692.0,Ugh that sounds awful. Yeah mine was super heavy and painful before the IUD (but probably not as bad as yours). So I guess I‚Äôm still in the waiting game to see what it‚Äôs like when it does finally come

medical,etiqxid,t1_ethxpuo,1562857811.0,"Thanks for your response. I worry about involuntary commitment because I feel logical in some ways. But then another part of my brain is getting out of control and I don‚Äôt just think about it when I‚Äôm alone, I think about it at work and everywhere. It also seems like a logical solution to some of the things I‚Äôm struggling with, I don‚Äôt need to go into detail. But then the sliver that‚Äôs the normal me sometimes jumps in to say, ‚Äúhold up, this is never a logical thought pattern. Stop.‚Äù But that part is going away and it‚Äôs scaring me.

ADHD,et44v22,t1_et1z3nh,1562444144.0,"Yeah, that‚Äôs exactly how I feel. I met with my psychologist a couple weeks ago and she suggested tracking mood, sleep, and focus to see if there is a pattern that would allow me to better predict when I can be successful. She told me not to limit myself because I can do anything. I feel like that advice is good for people that maybe don‚Äôt have such lofty goals...she also suggested trying to make some amendments to the career goals I have. But all I can think of are amendments and don‚Äôt know how to succeed when meds only help be not so hyperactive but don‚Äôt impact focus well.

AskReddit,et0ctn4,t1_esrkxoh,1562376744.0,"Yeah, I see what you mean. But a lot of medicine is based on the best information we have now. Thinking of ADHD, for me, is hard because we don‚Äôt understand the mechanisms for it. But is it better to focus on finding the mechanism or treating the symptoms until we have better information? Even if we understand the mechanism, which hopefully one day we do, treating what would be considered subjective symptoms offers considerable benefit to patients. But there are some cool more quantitative studies, if you will, on recognizing depression in patients by using technology to analyze eye movements, facial expressions, etc. Or studies that show how to determine if someone has feigned ADHD. Check them out, they‚Äôre pretty interesting and developed by psychologists."

AskReddit,esnjoio,t1_esnilw1,1562135144.0,"Haha that's true. I guess I was thinking about me and how I only have ADHD, nothing else. That's something well researched and my psychologist is super well informed on it even though she doesn't/can't prescribe medication. With my psychiatrist I just say if I think it works or not, he might ask how I sleep if I didn't mention it, and I'm out in 5 minutes. So I'm like, if I was just trying meds I don't know why my PCP couldn't just write the scrip while conferring with the psychologist since my PCP may not know the best ADHD medications."

AskReddit,esnj4x5,t3_c8kgl8,1562134473.0,"From what I have gathered, Clinical Psychologists have a PhD, PsyD, or possibly MD in their field. They are excellent at performing evaluations and potentially diagnosing because they spend years studying psychology not going to med school. They are also trained in different modes of therapy through their Bachelor's, Master's and then final degree.

PCP's and Psychiatrists both go to med school and then split ways.

Psychiatrists do their rotations and internships focusing on psychiatry, but that's not as many years as a Psychologist. It seems they mostly learn about effective medications from my experience.

PCPs don't know much about mental health, but they do understand drugs they can prescribe and the side effects, although not in as much detail as a Psychiatrist.

I have an excellent PsyD. She evaluated/diagnosed me with ADHD, has helped me with some therapy, and is wicked smart. I've been reading a ton of peer reviewed articles and she seems very on top of everything I have read, even things that haven't been necessarily proven but a single study has shown support for. My Psychiatrist on the other hand, started me on some less popular, and less research supported, medications first. He blew off my psychologists email discussion and notification that I was being referred (I feel like because he thinks he knows more than a psychologist), is not very personable, doesn't offer therapy, and is more of a box to check to find medication.

So what's the point of a psychiatrist? Are they just people who went to med school and then decided they liked pharmacy or psychology? Wouldn't a psychologist, a PCP, and potentially a pharmacist working together be the most effective for mental health patients?"

Particularly in developed countries, inequality is a huge factor in people‚Äôs lives. When there is a significant difference between the top and the bottom, or even middle class, research shows feeling poor has the same bad life outcomes as actually being poor. If you haven‚Äôt read The Broken Ladder I would highly recommend it!"

medical,es8m9xf,t1_es8jbxk,1561703472.0,"Read another thing. The motor neurons are extremely important for telling the muscles to move. But they are also a channel. This channel allows messages to be passed through the body including where nutrients are needed and helps deliver them there. So going back to what I said before, it seems that with high intensity there is more muscle damage and more inflammation, inflammation likely being a key mechanism of the disease. Because muscles are already atrophying from daily activity (because motor neurons are slowly dying), now you add intense exercise and cause further atrophy and inflammation. This would seem to speed up the process as the body is, at baseline, less able to recover because it has fewer and less functional pathways of communication available to tell the body to send more nutrients for recovery and is less able to move and stretch to reduce inflammation. Although the inflammation is confusing because research shows it more a result of the cell death not the cause"
medical,es8l83l,t1_es8jbxk,1561702199.0,"Now I'm pretty interested in this and reading more.

But without too much research and just thinking out loud so far, yes literal nutrients come from blood but movement, allowed by healthy functioning nerves, I helps recovery too. I know that if I workout ""intensely"" and am a bit sore, which comes from inflammation not so much lactic acid as commonly assumed, I will become much more sore if I don't stretch, walk, or do some light activity afterward or the next day. So if you're damaging muscle and you're not guaranteed precisely **when** neves might die, you may not be able to help muscle recover from damage by moving as well as before. I don't think it's dramatic like you worked out your legs and now you can't walk, but that's kind of what happens over time. Also inflammation is a key mechanism for how ALS works I guess, so you probably don't want to try and create more by exercising intensely."

mentalhealth,es8k5nc,t3_c6e3ag,1561700956.0,"Yes, I totally get your frustration. I feel like you're saying- let's stop encouraging people to battle but try instead to address the **root cause** of the issue and identify the social issues causing the prevalence of mental health issues in the first place.

But in my perception, mental health and mental illness are spoken about differently. I see mental illness spoken about as something you need to battle versus mental health being something we need to rally around and support because everyone has it. Ie: maybe you don't have clinical depression, but you are going through a rough time, would like to become stronger mentally, overcome a fear, or go to therapy.

I also get that mental illness can sometimes be talked about and compared to cancer because in some ways it is a disease, ie: addiction, like cancer. It may go into remission or it may come back. In the future, it is also very likely that we won't find a ""cure"" to cancer but rather discover ways for people to ""live with it."" Because of growing life expectancy and prevalence of cancers it will probably be easier to find treatments for people to have a high quality of life, similar to many other diseases (HIV being a great example) or even mental illness, while still having cancer. So I get the comparison."
medical,es8j0el,t3_c6fg9c,1561699693.0,"I wonder if it's because when you work out at a high intensity you are temporarily damaging muscles then as you recover, your body is rebuilding them. So if you have ALS, the A literally being ""no muscle nourishment,"" your body is already unable to heal these muscles each day, not from working out but from just existing and the maintenance required to keep all body parts healthy on the daily. Now add working out at a high intensity to the mix. With ALS muscles are already atrophying at baseline, so intense workouts would be an additional injury or atrophy that would need nourishment to be rebuilt. It seems like this would speed up the process of ALS. But working out at medium intensity would seem to make sense because you're not breaking muscle fibers (or maybe not as many?) or becoming sore after these workouts, you're usually just trying to maintain and use the muscle you have.

I'm not a doctor, but based on what I know this would see the most logical answer. Let's see what others say!"
ADHD,es8crb7,t1_es857qs,1561693698.0,"Yeah, I like healthcare but also hate it. It seems so simple to solve tons of its issues but I have found time and time again resolutions are too frequently impeded by key people not being willing to put in a little effort, not wanting to change, and bureaucracy. The ethics sometimes kill me as well because hospitals should be helping people, especially if they‚Äôre a nonprofit hospital, and so many processes are still unjust or there aren‚Äôt repercussions for incompetence for so many healthcare employees.
If everyone in healthcare were as excited and hardworking as some of the front of line staffers to changing it for the better I would stay in this field forever. But it seems CEOs and upper management are often so detached or it would require more effort but not more bonuses so they aren‚Äôt willing to support positive changes."

ADHD,es8bwn2,t1_es86fq3,1561692996.0,I have thought about going the electrical route so that I could get a job working at a renewable lab or university eventually. Does it feel like a rote job though or are you consistently challenged and inventing?
ADHD,es8bqnw,t1_es7bb2v,1561692858.0,"Medical Social Work sounds interesting! Unlike a regular social worker do you mostly do acute care and then the follow up is done by someone else outside the hospital once they are released or transferred?

ADHD,es8bj72,t1_es7iyjg,1561692690.0,"Yeah, I am incredibly hit and miss though. In college, I finished and was awarded one grant for a nonprofit and then the next day we had to drop two proposals because I could not focus enough to put anything together worth submitting. In the real world I feel like that‚Äôs hard to deal with because that‚Äôs something that could get you fired. I get what you‚Äôre saying, but also for that situation or other like it I can‚Äôt think of a way to fix this and make amendments. Maybe if I was working with a team that would help level the inconsistency in the final product but I also imagine it would frustrate them so maybe that‚Äôs not an amendment I should make"

mentalhealth,erya2ej,t3_c4i02g,1561403887.0,"That would be cool. But I also wonder if it would make some scenarios more difficult. Like if someone thought they were having a panic attack because they had a history of them but this time they were actually having a heart attack, there might not be the best kind of doctor available to treat them. I see your point though. I wish mental health services would become more integrated and more doctors would look at physical symptoms as having a mental connection too sometimes. The mind body connection is super important and there have been studies that show the mind can cause you to have physical symptoms even if you don‚Äôt have a physical disorder (which most doctors focus on and try to treat rather than the root mental cause sometimes). In some ways it has gotten a bit better, the clinic I go to is focused on women and have all female doctors. They also have an in house psychologist who they refer to for mental health testing and sometimes counseling. I love it! Because of this they also are more educated on how some disorders, both mental and physical, are sometimes shown differently in women because a lot of research was historically completed on white males. So I feel like we‚Äôre making strides, but still have a long way to go, as with a lot of social issues"

But at the same time, some other people might say I don‚Äôt have attention to detail because I‚Äôll forget so many things or I get so distracted (noticing something else that may or may not be relevant in the moment).

But now with my job, a totally different situation, when things like this happen that reflect badly on my boss I don‚Äôt feel so bad. Because if I constantly covered for my boss no one would know the incompetence and how her actions could affect patients. So I let lots of mistakes I could fix slide by because if I don‚Äôt then the root problem will never be addressed. It also frustrates my boss‚Äôs boss when they have to fix her mistakes, but when they are frustrated too I am no longer the only one that cares that these things happen and that is what is needed for change to occur sometimes.
I don‚Äôt know if this is helpful but it sounds like your work environment could be similar to mine. Without going into too much detail of my job, I obviously don‚Äôt let major mistakes that hurt people slide by. Just the ones I know someone will catch and have to fix now, but is now irritating because they have to and if they hadn‚Äôt it could have been a bigger deal, we could have lost money, results would be compromised, etc. Sounds terrible but it‚Äôs what has to be done to get people to be held accountable and change sometimes."

ADHD,erarx8v,t1_erad214,1560651457.0,"This was kind of my train of thought too. But with so many people saying they can tell their medication is working because they get more motivated, I was doubting how I and others may be evaluating if their medication is working. I have never felt the initial euphoria or had the ‚Äúit was like putting on glasses‚Äù moment that some people describe. The first medication I tried, Concerta, I thought was maybe working similarly to an antibiotic, like you take it and you don‚Äôt feel the moment it starts working but you slowly start to feel better (ie: less distractibility or less errors at work and maybe I wasn‚Äôt noticing benefits because they presented as a reduction in the negatives of life with unmedicated ADHD rather than the addition of positives). But after a few weeks of trial (no need to go into details), it was clear it was having NO effect and it wasn‚Äôt because I wasn‚Äôt giving it a chance or looking for euphoria some people described.

So now I‚Äôm on medication two and a higher dose than the first prescription. Still no euphoria and I can‚Äôt pinpoint the half hour/hour it kicks in but I have noticed a reduction in the negative aspects of ADHD. I‚Äôm able to sit at work now and not get 20k steps just at work because I can‚Äôt sit still, I notice when people are trying to get my attention much faster, I sleep better, and research for work is more organized and I don‚Äôt have 1629201 tabs open. So it seems the antibiotic analogy is how it‚Äôs working for me now. But I don‚Äôt know how to tell if I‚Äôm getting maximum benefit without tipping into that too much area? Most people seem to know when it‚Äôs too much when their heart is racing or they‚Äôre feeling way too euphoric"
ADHD,era5kie,t1_era2kcj,1560636335.0,"That‚Äôs good. Yeah some people caution not to equate that euphoric effect when you first start them to them ‚Äúworking‚Äù because that will go away, while the ability to focus should stay.

I‚Äôm just starting down the medication track but I‚Äôm worried about developing a tolerance and needing higher doses as time goes on since moderate doses don‚Äôt have an effect. I‚Äôve never felt motivated or euphoric from any of the meds I‚Äôve tried, even the moderate-higher doses, but does that mean I should go higher? Like should I keep trying until I feel focused AND motivated but not euphoric? Or is a moderate ability to focus, bringing me to more neurotypical status, good enough?"
