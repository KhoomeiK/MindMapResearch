I do think the cheating aspect is intriguing in relationships because I ponder what kind of relationship you both had. Now if it’s a closed door policy, cheating is cheating. That’s a non-negotiable.

If you’re defensive in the means to survive the relationship it doesn’t excuse your actions of any kind of abuse. I understand you didn’t feel appreciated. I’m sure she didn’t either. I don’t know her but I’m relationships, it takes two.

There is nothing wrong with separation and downtime to let them figure things out. I think first decide if this is a midlife crisis or existential crisis first. You can’t save your partner if they have an AP and those chemicals are powerful. If after six months and they don’t come home, reach out or are remorseful, pull the plug.
