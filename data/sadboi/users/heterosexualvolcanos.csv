BPD,fnnj9aq,t3_g2rsbm,1587093663.0,"The same stupid cycle wake up, feel like shit, go to work, random burst of energy, realization that everything is shit, back home just to sit and loathe. Then off to bed where you can lay restless about never accomplishing anything. Then it all starts again."
BPD,fnnhggv,t3_flowf0,1587092462.0,"Holy shit same. Out of nowhere my boring day goes sunshine and fucking rainbows. I forget everything bad and I can literally do anything. Math homework, no problem! Need to work around the house, shit say no more. Then all it takes is one little thing, one tiny factor to remind me that nothing I do will ever matter and there’s no point in anything. Then I’m stuck like that until the sun decides to shine once more."
