SuicideWatch,eurz7x6,t1_eurh00m,1564000962.0,The people I’ve reached out to are tired of me reaching out. I reached out today because it’s a particularly hard day and was met with frustration. I vented and I think I went about it the wrong way and was misunderstood which caused the person I reached out to become a bit annoyed and frustrated. These episodes happen at least one a month or two. It’s been worse since my cousin passed away almost a year ago and the anniversary is coming up in September and that’s all i can think about sometimes. That and the fact that I’m not special to anyone. I hate myself for wanting to be special to anyone. Like what’s wrong with me and why am I so weak? I’m annoyed and tired of myself.

That being said, today he brought up that fact and told me he holds no affection or romantic feelings for me. This is after not letting me know that he’s been upset with me since Sunday. Welp. I was sent a picture today....of him..and the aforementioned friend...on her birthday and he’s basically holding her from behind with one hand placed on her stomach and her hand on his. He denied anything is going on and insists they’re just friends. So I asked what if the tables were flipped and he saw a pic of me letting someone hold me that way, and then he proceeded to tell me he wouldn’t think anything of it because he a)trusts me and b) isn’t bothered because in actuality we aren’t in a relationship and are both single.  We’ve been at this for two years (not counting the pre break up relationship). People just assume we’re dating coz that’s how we tend to act in public as we do have great chemistry and are usually flirting.  I’m feeling lost and like an idiot. 

I think I need to walk away from this one. Clearly he’s letting me know how things are and I need not push it further. Can’t stay where I’m not wanted, right?"
