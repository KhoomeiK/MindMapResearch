LittleFiresEverywhere,fpe75av,t1_fpe1qb2,1588541697.0,Thank you for understanding my point of view! I’ll try to look at it in that way
TooHotToHandle,foh7atq,t3_g7d4o6,1587761329.0,I have no idea what I’m saying yes or no to
TooHotToHandle,fo8c5fp,t3_g63wac,1587593757.0,Being immature is no excuse. Harry’s a douchebag
TooHotToHandle,fo8323g,t3_g5wkmk,1587589027.0,"Wow. The thing is, she’s still pretty now but the plastic surgery is so overdone. When I first saw her walk in, I immediately was like “damn she’s hot” and then I got a good look at her face (especially her lips) and they are so over injected that it just bothered me. She really does look like every other IG model."
Anxietyhelp,fo5w7rr,t3_g1jlz0,1587537713.0,It has been so hard. I can’t wait until this can be over so I can just stop feeling like this.
Anxiety,fo5vtnu,t3_g5lc4j,1587537343.0,Definitely going to try this!

DontFuckWithCats,fbg5es1,t1_fbf2ze0,1576835319.0,"I had the EXACT same thought when he said he watched it 20 times. I also thought it was weird that he put it up on a big screen to watch too...I can’t even watch anything like that on my small phone screen so I can’t imagine watching it on a big T.V. screen or something.

Also, when another member said they can’t watch the video because it was obviously very gory and sick. He was like “you have to!!!!!” Idk, that was the one part that was just extremely weird to me"
Anxiety,erminz8,t3_c2rp6n,1561024787.0,"I relate to this so hard. I did this same exercise with my therapist a while back and it was pretty easy to do because she gave me some random scenarios that had nothing to do with me. It’s funny that I could see the rational counterarguments in those but when it comes to my own anxiety, I can’t do the same for shit. 

Whenever I try to be rational with myself, my anxiety just comes in really fast like “BUT WHAT IF?????” which is so annoying. This is probably what I struggle with the most."
Anxiety,ermi7mh,t3_c2tt46,1561024094.0,I’m the exact same. I feel this way especially with instagram where everyone can see how many likes you get. Just the thought of actually uploading pictures makes my heart race. I have one post on my instagram right now and I don’t know how I even mustered up the courage to post that!
TheSocietyNetflix,epiu6y0,t3_btc42i,1559243282.0,There’s something about his face that is just immensely annoying.
TheSocietyNetflix,eonl5f1,t3_bsfkz0,1558715230.0,"I also missed Elle and Campbell meeting on the bus. I was so confused when they were playing fugitive and Campbell caught her and she was like “why do you keep picking me?” I was like...huh? I thought it was something that they just didn’t put in the show but were just alluding to or something.

I also kept getting Lexie mixed up with the girl that was faking the relationship with that one guard (still don’t know his name) so that they could have a private room. I think her name is Gwen? Idek"
