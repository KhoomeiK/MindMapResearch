OCD,ff9jivj,t1_ff7g5xl,1579714347.0,"I understand... it's so hard to fight the way you think, isn't it? I mean... it's your mind!  It takes so much work and struggle, and even when you are able to push yourself ahead, one pebble of imbalance sends you stumbling right back into the gutter... 

You just keep going. Keep fighting. If one thing doesn't work, try the next. And do that every time, because you never know when something that didn't work before will suddenly do the trick. Don't stop trying. Tell yourself you are not a victim, you are a warrior. The battle is in your brain, but it's still gory af. And surround yourself as much as possible with the people and the things that give you those small moments of respite, find the things you enjoy and embrace them. You are not a disappointment. You are not bothersome. You are in pain. Pain is a soul killer. Just keep fighting."
