joker,fc4js1b,t3_eg3oxq,1577418711.0,"Bowie was initially considered for the Joker roll in the 89 Batman movie. Actually, I think even Bowie inspired some comic book artists who drew the Joker. But don‚Äôt quote me on that.

And I just read that apparently Jared Leto drew some inspiration from Bowie‚Äôs thin white duke persona when he portrayed Joker in Suicide Squad.

And here‚Äôs one more tidbit‚ÄîChristopher Walken was once considered for the Batman roll opposite Bowie. Wouldn‚Äôt that have been quite the movie??"

The funniest scene in my opinion was in the firehouse when they were trying to start a fire during training. Pollard walks up to Martin and calls out, ‚ÄúChief, we can‚Äôt get it started!‚Äù (Referring to the Fire). When he turns around and walks away, Martin notices that the back of Pollard‚Äôs fireman‚Äôs coat (if I remember correctly) is on Fire. Still makes me cry laugh. RIP Michael J. Pollard."
