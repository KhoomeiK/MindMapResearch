Which is just a coping mechanism for me to feel less crap about myself and THAT is the problem, rather than her ""not being in the mood/ too tired/ whatever. 

Actually, that's  what I wanted to put my emphasis on. I just extrapolate that on masturbation as well (and thus qualify myself as a 'nofap believer'). Basically if you masturbate you just make your brain feel like you are done with issues in general since you get rewarded if I can put it that way. Now, I would suggest to try to deny yourself this self gratification and observe how your body reacts, what ideas, aside from the unrest come to your mind, about yourself, about your SO and in general. You might get plenty of good ideas, thoughts, feelings and some bad, stupid ones, but you will likely get positive results of the experience.

&#x200B;

About the SO not in the mood, it's just that a natural reaction of being horny is unrest, that you can transform into productivity, sport and thus make directly or indirectly your SO happier and it's a virtuous circle.

Still, I can't go on longer, it's a a gut feeling that feels correct. However the intention behind the pornfree movement is already very honorable."

Aside from that, this unreleased tension just pushes you to be stronger and to confront you farther with your inner self.

There will always be 'that' one sin, that you will always fall back to if you make it the main focus of your conscience.

Do not focus too much on polarizing values (lust vs holiness, academical success vs taking it easy), try to approach everything with moderation, even with expressing your carnal passions if it makes sense and you should achieve better results in life and in this journey of being a better off and well-rounded person."

I was emotionally and physically completely depleted (lost around 6 kg in one month, fasted, worked out one hour a day, my brain fellt like in meltdown) This was the first time I truly experienced fear of dying for reasons unrelated to school work, or fear of  the repercussions from my parents from making a mistake such as a theft or a white lie ... Thank you, first of all, for believing me.

Gifts of the  Holy spirit really exists. And even for non believers who think they 'know or have seen it all'. I can affirm, from my personal experience and learning, that every year brings its owns opportunities to discover new things that can completely redefines someone's worldview."
Catholicism,f5s06hu,t3_doza5k,1572407480.0,"I also got amazing gifts from the holy spirit. This really exists. In my case, I am for unexplainable reasons see a little bit more about people whether in reality or in pictures. It s a little bit like seeing into their soul through their eyes or into their clothings, one layer under, difficult to explain but it helped me."
SuicideWatch,f5rqta7,t3_doxe8i,1572400745.0,I am sorry for you but you probably know better how difficult and competitive this industry is. If I were you I would be focussing on building your portfolio until you get a job in that domain again.
SuicideWatch,f5fjeng,t3_dnt0pq,1572183269.0,"You have above all, very probably a negative mindset and it probably negatively impacts your life."
SuicideWatch,f4gryn3,t3_dkj93f,1571583966.0,You had a unique friendship and many unfortunate events. Nice to remember and cherish.
SuicideWatch,f4gpycj,t3_dkk1go,1571583468.0,You should develop more to get some support ideally.
SuicideWatch,f3t1g2v,t1_f3gnum3,1571115130.0,Very nicely summarized. Too much introspection in this situation can often backfire. You focus on seeing everything through negative lenses and more problems instead of solutions.
SuicideWatch,f2z63fh,t3_deurwk,1570507674.0,Never stop going !
SuicideWatch,f1v7oa9,t1_f0xl9ou,1569767824.0,"I am sure it's not that bad. I am always on the sad/unhappy/melancholic side as a state of mind, also because there has always been something bad that occured at the same time as something good happened in my life. Hence I never had the ability to enjoy proper victory moments, but I also know my perception and my worldview are not a good catalysts to attract happiness in my surroundings.

It's a constant act of balance between seeing all the problems and trying to reach for the good things of life."
