BPD,f1dxwcf,t3_d6esmt,1569405017.0,"I know what you are talking about. I am soo good at acting normal, the weird thing is, I guess I am so used to it, I do it for physical pain too? Once I had a really terrible pain, but I tried to stay focused. I was with some friends and my boyfriend, I told them I will go to the ER so they can check on me. They thought I am joking because I “looked fine”. I went and I got admitted in hospital."
BPD,f1dwvtr,t3_d8rkqf,1569403620.0,"Something similar happened to me.  When I left my job, I was replaced by two people. After almost 2 years, I couldnt handle the stress anymore. I was a graphic designer in advertising agency. We had a lot more work than we could handle, and still i was doing my best and always finished things on time. They took advantage of this fact and always gave me more and more, because they knew I would get it done.  Sometimes I would go to the bathroom to cry and i felt useless and thought the BPD is getting over me and im just dramatizing. The fact that they had to hire two people on my place that can barely keep up, makes me feel a little better."
