What I have found from rehabilitating my social skills is that you have to know what your ""game"" is. Some people aren't mean to hang out in a group of friends. Some are better off hanging out 1 on 1. If you're not the kind to have a whole group immersed in your words, then don't try to be that person. It'll only frustrate you.

And sometimes you just need to swipe left and move onto the next tribe/friend. When you find someone who vibrates at the same frequency as you, you will regret all of the time you spent trying to be a square peg fitting into a circular hole."
