I can have bad days but they don’t derail my life like they used to, and my bad mood will really only last a few hours at most. Instead of feeling depressed I’ll feel more “meh” than anything. Definitely have had a few days where I’d say I was in a slightly elevated mood, but it didn’t feel as extreme as my hypomanic episodes in the past. I guess you could say i felt like a normal person having a really good day. 

I think what’s really been helping my stability has been stopping smoking pot (makes me depressed for 1-2 days), exercising more, and being on a consistent schedule with school. Honestly, I’d recommend cutting out the weed and trying to do even just 5-10 minutes of some physical activity before you up your dose. I worry if I have to raise my dose up to like 200+, I might start to have some cognitive issues... I sometimes have issues finding words but that’s probably from having shit sleep lol.

I was stuck between debilitating anxiety or risk benzo dependence. I foolishly took the easy way and stayed on them for like a year or so before I realized it was slowing my brain and I was having withdrawals between doses. Once I got to this point, I was in WAY too deep, and it was so hard getting off them without completely fucking my life up... which I did anyways. 

I’m not doctor and I really haven’t gone thru anything like you (and I’m so sorry this happened to you), but if you’re open to medication, maybe ask ur doc about taking something like an SSRI like lexapro for your anxiety and ambien (similar to benzo) to sleep on nights you really need it. 

Whatever you do, try not to take benzos (or ambien) daily. The benefit you get in the short term you will pay for 10x down the road. Withdrawals lasted months for me.

My OCDish symptoms are pretty mild I’d say, but I have a history of these tendencies so I can identify they’re obsessive thoughts in the moment, but still have to follow thru and check. They definitely got worse on lamictal but don’t happen too often.

For me though, I would cycle every 1-2 weeks or so. Sometimes I’ll be up for a few days and down for a week or two. Doesn’t happen recently now that I’m lamictal. Knock on wood. 

The most telling symptom for me the lack of or abundance of sleep. Idk how the fuck I sometimes go a week on 1-3 hours of sleep per night and feel more awake than I do normally sleeping 7-9 hrs. 

I’ve also been told my condition is mild but feel like the psychologist that told me that lacks the insight and knowledge on how I am day to day and week to week. 

Sure, from my outward appearance and behavior, you might not think much of it. When I’m depressed it’s easy for me to be amicable and seem normal for short periods of time (a mask). When I’m hypomanic it’s also easy to just mistake that as my normal self. 

Nobody else sees/feels the inner turmoil and extreme changes in energy. I can get my basic shit done and function somewhat like a normal person unless I’m super depressed... it’s just extremely hard at times.

I also deal with fibromyalgia-like symptoms (full body muscle and joint pain) and was told by a doctor that treating my sleep should alleviate most of that hopefully, so I’m hesitant to say I have fibromyalgia. I relate to your improvements on nights that i can successfully sleep with the cpap but those nights are so rare and I’ll get 4 hours of sleep with it if I’m lucky. 


I can’t tell if I’m “stable” as it’s only been a week or so that I’ve felt this way. I don’t even know what people mean when they refer to stability in the context of bipolar. 

I just can’t help but think it’s too idealistic to think my meds (50 mg lamictal) are already helping, and rather it’s another one of those phases where I feel “cured of depression” and it’s only a matter of time before I drop back into the abyss lol. 

How would you describe stability for yourself as opposed to being your normal bipolar self.

bipolar2,fdo0huh,t1_fdnqifv,1578596591.0,"Yeah, I’ve been taking lamictal for a little over three weeks and have noticed I’ve been consistently in a good mood, despite still feeling quite fatigued from my sleep. Usually I’m beyond paralyzed from my shit sleep and depression fatigue. Hard to do anything. 

I haven’t been officially diagnosed but they suspect type 2. I’ve had tons of hypomanic episodes that I always thought were my depression lifting or I got a “good night of sleep”. But my “good nights of sleep” were sleeping for like 1-4 hours and feeling wide awake lol. 

It’s kinda relieving to hear that the severity of your episodes has gone down for you... I assume the same will happen with me. I just was worried “maybe I’m not bipolar and it’s just sleep and I’m taking meds for no reason”. Prob not the case.

Now I’m not saying you shouldn’t get it checked out, but adderall would give me the worst chest pains. 

As for the other reasons for chest pain besides your heart, there is muscle pain from being so tense, costochondritis (inflammation between ribs and sternum), and just general anxiety chest tightness and shortness of breath. 

If you can rub your hand where you feel the pain, and it’s tender, it’s probably NOT your heart."
bipolar2,fctixu9,t3_ei25rh,1577944874.0,"i go to bed after my roommates and wake up way before them... with 3x as much energy with 3x less sleep

I wake up after 2-3 hours of sleep and instantly feel WIDE AWAKE. It literally feels like I just laid on my bed for 5 seconds at 1 in the afternoon. Absolutely zero fatigue. 

I don’t need time to “wake up”... I instantly FLY out of bed. It’s like I have a fire under my ass and am being ripped out of bed like a marionette. Idk how I do it tbh. 

I’ll get 1-3 hours of sleep, wake up, take a sleep aid or smoke some weed, wake up an hour later, repeat, repeat, repeat. If I want to get 7-9 hours of sleep, I probably will wake up 2-4 times during the night and need something to help me get back to sleep. Logically, I know I need sleep, but I see no point forcing myself to get a few hours of interrupted sleep — especially when I don’t feel like I need it. 

I’ll get 2-4 hours of sleep a night for like a week straight and I can SERIOUSLY start to feel the effects of sleep deprivation. I can’t think straight, an forgetful, awful at driving scary) and just feel like I’m losing touch a bit.

Makes you lazy and apathetic if you use it too much. 

Reduces sleep quality (even if you think it’s helping you fall asleep)

Impairs memory and concentration. 


The negative effects sneak up on you and you don’t really notice until you stop smoking from my experience.

I also would notice I’d go hypomanic when I stop smoking weed. It was so hard to quit before, but now I’m taking lamictal so I don’t really feel the need to smoke as much to get out of a high/low mood. Weed will consistently bring me back to my “stoned baseline”. My stoned baseline is better than being super depressed or hypomanic as shit, but I’ve been trying to reach a more normal baseline.

Best of luck. Weed can be very helpful if you use it responsibly and not daily. Save it for when you really need it. Try CBD/hemp if u want something for anxiety."
BipolarReddit,fckvjmy,t1_fcjxxzh,1577734112.0,"What about a hypomanic episode?

For me it’s symptoms like:

Increased confidence... feel like I can accomplish anything with ease

Very generous with money or giving shit away

Wanting to constantly do stuff with friends. Constantly talking, even with strangers. Calling friends in the middle of the night.

Everything is funny and awesome

People ask if I’m on drugs or drunk. I feel high on life. 

New projects constantly. Everything is a great idea. 

I get weird new obsessions and try to consume every bit of knowledge on the subject. I start new hobbies or skills and want to be THE BEST instantly because I KNOW  I can (okay I FEEL like I can)

I work on my personal business projects SO MUCH and get so much done (it’s fucking great)

2-3 hours of sleep feeling wide awake. Even if it’s not as extreme as 2-3 hours a night, I’m always going to bed after my roommates and waking up before them, ready to go with way more energy. 

Music and everything sounds better (euphoria?)

Feeling cured from my depression and anxiety 

Thoughts don’t stop racing, usually positive thoughts about things I can do to better myself and become my ideal self 

Grandiose thinking like, I’m so much smarter than everybody, more attractive, superior world views. 

Thinking I’ve “figured out” the key to life, happiness, and success and it’s only a matter of time and effort for me to achieve what I’ve been wanting forever. 

I’ll meet girls during a phase like this and feel so strongly toward them in like a day. I’ll think they’re “the one” lmaoooo I guess. 

My standard for girls drops, and I can see beauty in everyone and everything. People I wouldn’t find attractive before are absolutely beautiful. 

Can you relate to any of these? Of course, it’ll be different for everyone but that’s how I feel.
