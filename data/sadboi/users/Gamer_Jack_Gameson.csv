Couples therapy isn't recommended in abusive relationships, but if this is the only major fight the two of you have and you are otherwise happy together, then it may not rise to the level of abuse and couples therapy could be helpful.

Please, for your sake and for your future partner's, take some time to be single and learn to love yourself. Not only is a relationship soon after abuse more likely to fail, but something far, far worse can happen:

You can become the abuser.

This is what happened to my ex (my abuser). I started dating her almost as soon as she left her abuser. She said I was her savior (at first). Over the course of a year, instead of healing and growing, she carried all her resentment over into our relationship and became abusive herself. She was so used to fighting dragons that she didnt know anything else. She lashed out at me. She was anxious and took her stress out on me. She was still hurting and took her pain out on me.

Please, please, please wait to get into another relationship. Sometimes hurt people hurt people.

Boundaries are boundaries and if its rigid then that needs to be respected. A flexible boundary sounds like a liability to me, a weapon to be used to disrespect said boundary. I can easily imagine an abuser taking this image and using it to manipulate their victim into believing that having clear boundaries is unhealthy and they should let the abuser cross those boundaries sometimes or they are being unreasonable.

I'm just having a strong gut reaction to this.

Edit: maybe this is a good diagram for most people but for an abuse victim those rigid boundaries can be necessary for survival. When you are recovering from abuse you will have triggers and it's impossible to tell in the moment whether that's a genuine threat or you are being triggered by something non-threatening. You have to trust your gut on it as a matter of survival. There's a really wonderful article talking about it at length. I'll link it if I can find it again.

abusiverelationships,fqu6nz0,t3_gku2jz,1589653061.0,"Warning: semi-descriptive sexual content below

I'm going through something similar and thought about posting about it too! I don't know what to say for advice because I'm confused about the same things, but I will share my experience.

I look back on the relationship and wonder if I was sexually abused. It seems minor compared to the emotional abuse and it doesn't cause the same kind of pain to think about most of the time, but when I consider the sexual side of things as a part of the whole relationship, it disturbs me. There was only a single time where I felt violated during sex with her because I had finished before her and she was near climax, so she insisted that I keep going even though i wanted to stop. It usually wasnt a problem if that happened and I would keep going, but for whatever reason I just really wanted to stop that time. Over many months of tearing down my sense of freedom and identity I felt that it was my obligation to please her as that was the most important thing in my life. If I didn't make her happy then she would make me feel terrible or worse--she might leave me--and that was unthinkable because no one else could ever love me. So I didnt say anything and kept going. For her.

Other times when I didnt want to have sex I would do it anyway because she wanted it. I gave her no indication that I wasnt feeling it. It was supremely important for me to be able to make her happy because that's how abused people think, so I needed to appear willing at all times. She never forced me to have sex. She didn't have to because she was in control. She didn't know that I didnt want it sometimes when she did.

Is that sexual abuse? Even though she never forced me and wasn't aware of my lack of desire, the only reason I had sex those times and hid it from her is *because she was abusing me emotionally*. It wasnt like I had to hold back a gag reflex or anything and I still enjoyed it for the most part after we got going except trouble keeping it up at those times. It just really disturbs me because the emotional abuse is what put me in this situation where I was having sex when I didnt want to. She caused that. 

It's so confusing."
emotionalabuse,fqsnnkc,t3_gk1695,1589612608.0,"It was a long, difficult, and confusing process, especially since my abuser denies that it was abuse. That really has an impact, and most people will never get their abuser to take responsibility or apologize.

We dated for about a year. I didn't start questioning whether I was in an abusive relationship until 2 months after we broke up, and it took many months of painful examination of the relationship, wondering if I was just overly sensitive, wondering if maybe I was the real abuser for accusing her of abuse, and just doubting myself constantly until I finally accepted that yes, it was abuse, and I was the victim.

I would say that took about a year to get to the point where I was totally certain and confident that what happened to me was emotional abuse. Prior to that, I slowly and painatakingly became less doubtful and more confident over time. There was a realization over several days of researching that it was abuse (2 months post breakup), not a sudden ""aha!"" moment. 

It is now 18 months since we broke up and I have started healing much better, although the pain is still very much there and it will leave me with scars forever. To this day I still have nights where I cant sleep until 4 in the morning because I have flashbacks and panic attacks when I lay down. Getting rid of the doubt and finding clarity is a big step toward recovery, but it can take a long time. One of the effects of abuse is doubting yourself and having no self esteem. That hinders your ability to trust yourself and your instincts until you've been away from your abuser for awhile.

Hang in there. If you are questioning whether you were abused, chances are you were.

Edit: after thinking about it some more, I'd say it was more like a year before I was totally certain, not 8 months."
emotionalabuse,fqsksos,t3_gkk97z,1589610112.0,"Abuse is about power and control. One person dominates the other and controls them.

One of the clearest signs of emotional abuse is how it makes you feel vs how you felt before. This is harder to determine when its parents abusing children because there was no time when you were not being abused. Is this a romantic partner, a relative, your parents, a friend, or someone you work with? It's important for us to know that.

Do you feel confused and sad?

If this is a romantic partner, how do you feel now vs how you felt before the relationship? Have you lost self esteem? Do you feel unworthy? Do you feel like your partner is the best you can do and that no one else would ever love you?

Is this person controlling?

Examples of abusive controlling behavior:

 Telling you what to wear. This can be direct (""wear this. Dont wear that. That's too revealing, take it off. Wear something sexy when you come over."") or indirect (""that shirt is really ugly. I don't like it when you wear grey. You look better in tight clothes. That makes you look stupid."")


Controlling who you talk to and spend time with. Again this can be direct (""You better not be hanging out with him/her. I told you not to talk to them anymore."") or indirect (""Your friends are such losers. You should hang out with better peope. I dont like your brother.). They can also control who you see by simply taking up all of your time and making you feel guilty for having a life outside of them (""why do you have to go out tonight? You make me feel like crap. You dont really care about me because you're going out with your friends instead of me. Come see me instead."")

Another huge red flag for abuse is they do not respect your boundaries. If you tell someone NO, they should respect that and not do whatever it is you aren't comfortable with. It can be tricky to see this for what it is because abusers also set ""boundaries"" that they expect you to follow which are part of the abuse.

Proper boundaries that need to be respected:

I cant come over tonight. I have important things I need to do.

I don't want to have sex right now

I dont feel comfortable going to that bar where everyone smokes.

Abusive behaviors pretending to be boundaries:

It makes me uncomfortable when you wear revealing outfits.

Its disrespectful when you hang out with your friends instead of with me.

---------

There are many signs of abuse. Can you tell us more about the person and your relationship with them?"
emotionalabuse,fqsgk3m,t3_gkmoy0,1589606679.0,"I suggest taking a break for a few weeks. It will be hard to be away from your partner, but it is essential to get out of the situation you're in so you can gain perspective on the relationship. After spending time away from the relationship you will see things more clearly that you cant see right now. Take the time to also think of what you want to say to your partner when you talk about the relationship going forward. Set ground rules for the relationship, set boundaries, make it clear what you are and are not comfortable with. Set a date to have this talk, say in two weeks, and stick to it.

Ad far as getting through the days, there is no advice that will make it better. It is going to be painful, but you will survive and come out a stronger person eventually.

There's one more important thing I want to address:

There is no such thing as mutual abuse. Abuse is about power and control, and that requires that one partner is dominating the other. There are unhealthy relationships, there are toxic relationships. There are mutually *violent* relationships, and those usually have a primary aggressor and a reactive aggressor. You can tell who is who by figuring out which one would stop hitting the other one if their partner stop hitting them. In other words, there is one partner who will hit their partner no matter what, and the other partner would stop hitting if their partner would stop. Truly mutual violent relationships where both partners are primary aggressors are either unheard of or just very rare, but that is NOT mutual abuse.

So, either you are the abuser and you are trying to minimize your abuse by labeling the whole relationship as toxic, or your partner is the abuser and they have gaslighted you into believing that you're just as much to blame as they are. I cannot and will not make that determination. It can be pretty hard to tell who is who sometimes.

Good luck. I hope things get better for you soon. Please take a break so you can figure out what's going on in a safer mental space."

In your case, there is hard evidence of a crime so I think they will probably prosecute, and your perpetrator will probably take a plea deal instead of going to trial (as they do in most cases), so it is unlikely you will have to testify.

[The Hydrothermal System of Dallol, Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallol_(hydrothermal_system)) is the most inhospitable place on Earth that humans can traverse (i.e. not the bottom of the ocean or the inside of a volcano), and has been for a long time.

The place consists of pools of boiling, concentrated acid and strange formations made of salt. The surrounding region is one of the hottest and driest places on the face of the Earth, with an average annual temperature of  34.6 °C (94.3 °F) and an average daily high of  41 °C (105 °F).

In terms of hostility to humans there are worse places to be, but in terms of hostility to life in general Dallol takes the cake. Soil samples from the area show that no microbial life grows there, not even extremophiles. For reference, boiling thermal vents found under the immense pressure and total darkness of the ocean floor still manage to contain some microbial life.

In modern times, the place is made even more dangerous by the fact that it is an undeveloped wasteland with no help for miles if you find yourself in trouble. On top of that, the closest governing body is in the middle of a bloody armed conflict which you must deal with if you plan to travel there, and it is difficult for them to enforce laws out in the wasteland.

All that being said, I agree with everyone else here. If he is shaking then his WDs are pretty severe and he *needs* to get medical attention. It is not optional. It could kill him.

After that, if he is looking for something  to help him maintain sobriety, I recommend looking into Kava Kava as a fallback for occasional relapse, which *will happen*. Kava helped me quit drinking, but you have to want to quit before it will work. Kava is not as effective or fun as alcohol and has barely noticeable mental effects, but it hits the same receptors and it hits them good enough to kill a craving or stop alcohol withdrawals. I took it every time I started feeling WDs or thought about going to the store to get some booze real quick, and it knocked that out. I also never had WDs bad enough to where I was shaking and having hallucinations, so take that with a grain of salt.

I think the years of living under a tyrannical drug enforcement agency got to a lot of people, and when they went after kratom, *kratom* of all things, a lot of people finally snapped. I know I did.

Vanilla is really interesting. It's a long bean-like pod that comes from a jungle vine orchid (the vanilla orchid, of course). It is dried out and turns from Green to brown. Inside are thousands of teeny tiny black seeds (smaller than poppy seeds) that are covered in a sticky brown paste. This is vanilla, and those tiny black seeds are the black specks you see in real vanilla ice cream. I would describe the taste of a vanilla bean as vanilla flavored. It is subtle and pungent at the same time. A tiny morsel can flavor a whole cup of coffee, but put a big chunk in your mouth and you can barely taste it. Strange and interesting stuff.

Cocoa is cool, too. It's a tree that also comes from the jungle and also has bean-like pods. The beans are picked, fermented, and dried. They are then cracked and roasted. I'm not sure what raw cocoa tastes like, but if it has to be fermented and roasted it can't be that great. I have had plain cocoa powder though, and I would describe the taste as bitter and mouthy, but somewhat lacking in flavor. It is not very good by itself."
