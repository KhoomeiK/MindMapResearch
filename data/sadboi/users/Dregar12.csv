Being selfish would be if you didn't give a shit about his feelings, but you DID give a shit. You gave him time, putting your feelings aside for his betterment. That's the complete opposite of being selfish. Unfortunately, it'll hurt a lot, and I understand. I had similar kinda shit with my ex while I was with her, so I can understand on a level. I'm not you though, so I can't fully understand how you feel, but trust me...if I could, I would. I never want anybody to be hurt or sad. PM me if you want, or talk to me on your post whenever you need me, IF you need to just rant. I can offer an ear, happily, and it won't bother me at all"

I've been through enough shit in my life to know how not to treat people, so I didn't want you thinking I'd keep memos maliciously. I was accused of horrific things by my ex before her (but I'm not gonna go into detail), so keeping things that could be twisted on me, and putting a date on them, is for my safety and peace of mind, as well as a place to vent it all out in order to cope while I was with her. I never wanted her to read them, but I did explain why I made them after she confronted me about it (which was after the whole event of that weekend), then we had a 'chat' about what she wrote and why, and what we can do together to sort it all out so I wouldn't have to write it all down. She wouldn't listen to me, told her mother a lot of made up nonsense, and I walked home, with only my phones and a little thing to 'drain the pain', to escape while they were in the kitchen."

It was my only way to vent, since I had nobody (and wasn't allowed) to have support. I would always speak to her about anything that upset or troubled me, as per our agreement at the start of the relationship (anything that upset us or troubled us, whether it was to do with the other person or not, we would talk to each other about it). But every time I spoke to her, I'd get the same response ""Oh yeah, cuz it's always my fault"", even over simple things. So the memos were just for me to open up. She always got her mother involved, too, if I opened up to her. Her and her mother always loved to bully me, even if what she told her mother wasn't at all true, so it was best I kept it to myself after so long of opening up just leading to shit. The memos I kept just in case she accused me of shit in the future, I'd have dates and events recorded in my phone."

However, they both kept talking over the WHOLE bloody anime about this guy being with that guy and how they'd ""make such a lovely couple""...and both guys are very straight, but very good friends with each other.

Now, that doesn't bother me, that they do this with animes. It's actually quite interesting. I would like to know why, cuz it astounds me, and I would really like to learn why.

The collwge bullied me from there on out. I was only allowed a ""Pass"" (C), though I did all work to at least a ""Merit"" (B). Got outta there, and got with a girl who seemed different and loving.

Her mum didn't help though, threatening to call my ex's nan and tell her I was drunk and a liar (I wasn't drunk, I was walking home from my walk, and I don't like lying, so choose not to).

AmItheAsshole,f4rbb73,t1_f4r95mb,1571765298.0,"Yeah, I understand that. I was worried I was either going to give too little info or too much. I probably should've just said it wasn't working out. Thank you"
AmItheAsshole,f4rauz9,t1_f4r9z0g,1571765137.0,"I never wanted to hurt my ex. I told her nan, because I feel terrible for lying to her, and I didn't want her nan to be annoyed at her when she finds out further down the road (when she's with someone else). I don't see any point in revenge when it won't fix anything. Although, I see where you're coming from, so I do understand"

Sjin,eyvrp0y,t3_cqdcq9,1567509109.0,"I found out about this last night. I'm not ashamed to say I cried. His humor, trolls and general personality helped me through a lot, although he may not know.

I want him back...it's like I've lost somebody so close to me, yet i never knew him personally.

I know I can't do anything to bring him back, but I at least hope he's okay. When/if he does come back to making videos, I just hope he's the same old Sjin...

...I hope he's safe and well...I hope he's okay."
