emotionalabuse,fr6fcno,t3_gmop7a,1589925226.0,I’d tell myself that there’s no rush and to enjoy the single life.
introvert,fqsni87,t3_gkfexf,1589612478.0,This has actually happened to me on a few calls at work and now I’m like I should just stay quiet like I usually do cause *cringe* Very awkward!
abusiverelationships,fqsm2xg,t1_fqseh0k,1589611228.0,This has also been my experience. The verbal abuse would increase and he’d laugh and ask if I was going to cry as I struggled to hold back tears with all of my might.
AskReddit,fq2ctkv,t1_fq10b0o,1589054911.0,This is a hilarious visual.
socialanxiety,fq2c83n,t1_fq1wt4r,1589054751.0,"It really does, it’s so hard for me to be vulnerable and if I do have a moment when I am I immediately regret it afterwards."
survivorsofabuse,fojm2gp,t3_g7qnt1,1587824358.0,Where is this from?
socialanxiety,fo55x4e,t1_fo4rww7,1587518204.0,This is beyond accurate. I’d be in shambles after this happened.
CPTSD,fmxkm23,t1_fmx1ozt,1586466754.0,Same!!
houseplants,fmunhqo,t3_fx87lg,1586394901.0,Love this and cool hair btw!
CPTSD,fmj5h0g,t1_fmg9uty,1586123427.0,Exactly! I know that it’s not intentional and people are bound to forget things sometimes. It’s never personal but of course I take it personally due to my trauma. It takes extreme effort for me to ask for things multiple times because I feel like I’m a bother too.
introvert,fmj56kq,t3_fv73o6,1586123252.0,"I ordered through doordash and it defaults to ‘leave at door’ now because of covid-19. Ummm, best delivery experience of my life! I have anxiety every time I have food delivered because of the interaction part so it was so nice. I felt guilty about loving it so much due to why it’s occurring, but any chance to keep anxiety levels low, I’m down for."
CPTSD,fmexn5b,t3_fuo8e8,1586015740.0,"This is a huge trigger for me so you’re not alone. I’ve recently noticed that this happens at work a lot when I ask someone if they can do something for me and they don’t get back to me and I have to follow up on it. I’ve been so uncomfortable with this lately. I’ve been getting extremely triggered by this and it is because it makes me feel like I’m being ignored and like I don’t matter. It’s due to all the neglect I’ve experienced in my life that resulted in me being ignored, chosen last if at all, and being made to feel so small."
survivorsofabuse,fl7ebrw,t3_fmttzt,1584899985.0,This is so amazing and I’m so glad for you. This rings true for me and has also helped me realize my own strength when I often feel so weak. Thank you!

introvert,fklkl6b,t3_fj7vj2,1584308505.0,This is exactly what I’ve done this weekend. I have not left my home since Friday night. I’m excited because it allows me to reset for the coming work week. Love

DecidingToBeBetter,fkc5cxy,t1_fkbn6jp,1584046100.0,I just downloaded this app and really like it. Thanks for the recommendation!
lonely,fkc3f6k,t3_fhfdu9,1584045023.0,"There’s been a few years that my parents and siblings have forgotten my birthday, so I’ve kind of trained myself to think of it as just another day. Granted I live in another state now, but still. It’s basically me trying to turn down the sting of disappointment. I’m also not into celebrating real big either because I’ve had people promise things that didn’t happen or just throw something together and it made me feel like I didn’t matter much."
introvert,fkc2b3v,t1_fka7imi,1584044407.0,I like the way you put that. Need a bit of time to build up energy and get in the right mindset... I often struggle with the kind of language to use to describe this to friends without making it more awkward. Kudos

DecidingToBeBetter,fk8w36m,t1_fk7cr1o,1583963997.0,I second this. I plan on writing out a handful of things that I’m grateful for on a consistent basis to help me with this issue.

houseplants,fk28jab,t3_ffxzcy,1583795440.0,Ahahahaha. I just did this not too long ago.
CPTSD,fk285hx,t1_fk1dvsx,1583795199.0,This is my experience too. Due to emotional abuse I feel like I have to prove that my opinions are valid so I over explain everything. I also feel the need to over explain my choices cause I’ve been told they were wrong or stupid so much. I also feel guilty about even voicing my opinions as if it were bad to do so.
DecidingToBeBetter,fk1m9o6,t3_ffti3g,1583782519.0,"I was also on nights for 5 years and it was tough. I got used to it eventually but I don’t think it’s good for the long run. I feel like a regular person now on day shift but when I switched jobs and didn’t have much time to adjust from nights to days, it was um, torture.

Edit: Typo"
socialanxiety,fk1d9c1,t3_ffmytz,1583777314.0,I do this a ton. I don’t like running into acquaintances. If I notice that I’ve spotted someone before they’ve seen me I will do everything to avoid that person. I really have trouble with small talk and breaking away from it but I always feel bad when I do this.
socialanxiety,fk1cvwi,t1_fk0aujv,1583777097.0,"Yup, I agree. They definitely go hand and hand. I am both socially anxious and an introvert."
socialanxiety,fk17xdl,t1_fjzw6wo,1583774225.0,Yeah I smile way too much too. I’ve been told that I came off as standoffish due to how quiet I am so I try to look more pleasant or nice by smiling. It makes me feel so inauthentic though. Cause like you said no one smiles ALL the time. It’s just not realistic but now it’s become a habit.
socialanxiety,fk17eb5,t1_fjzwxcx,1583773916.0,I agree. It helps with the why’s when you learn to accept yourself. I used to think there was something wrong with the fact that I was introverted since the world is a pretty extroverted place. The book Quiet by Susan Cain really helped me realize that it was ok to be who I am on the introvert-extrovert spectrum.
socialanxiety,fk15mid,t3_ffqjlk,1583772884.0,"I’m also going through something similar. I work in an office environment now where I spend a lot of time alone and don’t have much interaction with others outside of emails too. At first I was all like YEAH!!! The introverts paradise. Not realizing that I was regressing. My job now is the total opposite of my previous job where I had to work with and interact with all kinds of people. It was something I had to get used to and it definitely helped me with my people skills and I made a lot of friends this way.

But now I struggle connecting with others and I’ve definitely regressed a ton. I’ve also come to the realization that I just don’t have much in common with the people I work with either. It sucks cause it’s often awkward and I find it hard to relate to everyone so I’ve kind of stopped trying. Im just deemed the quiet one now. I’m also not getting much practice in my personal life so I’m totally there with you."
socialanxiety,fk14j6q,t3_ffraj0,1583772249.0,Aww I remember these days. It was tough but I made it through. I hope things went ok for you!
socialanxiety,fk144xa,t3_ffg2oo,1583772018.0,Hiya Buddy :)
socialanxiety,fk141zu,t1_fjzuo4d,1583771970.0,I can definitely relate. I find it so hard to tell people that I have to leave. It IS an absolute nightmare.
socialanxiety,fk13ety,t1_fk0dg18,1583771595.0,Nope I can’t believe that people are out here actually living like that.
socialanxiety,fk13bq7,t1_fjzo5sy,1583771545.0,LOL I know what you mean. I always try to think of something witty to say but then it ends up just being awkward. There’s been plenty of times I’ve deliberately avoided this by turning around and pretending like I forgot something or was going the wrong way just to avoid this :/
socialanxiety,fk12xyg,t1_fk07v6i,1583771339.0,I’m going to try doing this more often. I typically don’t use my hands at all when I speak but the few times I have it has distracted me a bit and gave me something else to focus on.
socialanxiety,fjavqkg,t1_fjak08t,1583181524.0,Same. I’m definitely both. Good to see I’m not the only one.
Anxiety,fj6o812,t1_fj609nr,1583076580.0,This is me. As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized the group outing is not my thing at all. I also have friends that have that the more the merrier attitude so I decline invitations to these kinds of outings all the time. I value more meaningful connections which usually means one or two people the most that I’m comfortable being around and don’t exhaust me.
ptsd,fj6mm91,t1_fj6jbk3,1583075612.0,I second this! Valerian root is amazing. I’ve also found it to be quite successful for anxiety when I take it before meetings and social events as well. I’m a lot less anxious when I take it before these kinds of things.
introvert,fhq0emq,t1_fhppmge,1581797594.0,I am the same way. I can still feel lonely and outright exhausted when around people who are not my “people”.

Especially the part about finding it strange when someone is kind to me or does things that are the “norm” but to me now are things that are worthy of praise. I often feel uncomfortable sometimes with simple acts of kindness like compliments, any sort of acknowledgement, and someone showing interest in me at all."
