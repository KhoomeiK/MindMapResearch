The same rhyme scheme of the first couple of lines fit really nicely into what the narrator is trying to convey. The feeling of ‚Äúagain and again and again‚Äù is really achieved with this.

This poem could be improved but it is already really good :)"

I love that the author is able to be vulnerable with himself (or herself). Having to admit that you are broken to yourself is a hard thing. That line ‚Äúall those nights were I just cry‚Äù really gives character to the author.

teenagers,fotqjyk,t1_fotp5o3,1588062575.0,"Hi, this is OP here. The meaning is whatever you make of it :)

I wanted to tackle the idea of ‚Äúbreathing not living‚Äù. And in a way, ‚Äúfaceless people‚Äù represent this meaninglessness. The ability to express your emotions are what makes you human, and to be stripped of that is to ask the question ‚Äúwhat are you ?‚Äù. At some point you have to ask yourself, are you really living ? Or are you just an empty meaningless husk of what you once was ? 

These faceless people are doing and expressing emotions and actions of a person with a face. So I hope have to made you ask yourself the question ‚Äúare these people really faceless ?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy is the author treating them like people ?‚Äù

I‚Äôll end this by saying,

Does losing the ability to express yourself mean losing what makes you YOU ?"
