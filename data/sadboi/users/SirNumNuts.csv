I just ended up feeling depressed and talking on the depression Reddit chat when people pointed me towards the ADHD subs saying I sound like I have it. Online tests all came positive in the highest percentages and I met with a psychiatrist cause of it who said yup, I need to start the process to get properly diagnosed as an adult. This is all new to me and I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with both how much there is to do about it and also how nice and welcoming the like-minded community is :) I have my final law exams in two weeks and I can't even bring myself to study. This is the end of my degree too and it took two years longer to complete than it did for the other kids. I struggled being an undiagnosed child, I faced life with all of its harsh criticisms and dealt with a lifetime of ""you're so lazy. Why can't you focus on yourself?"", ""How can you forget to eat? Why do you lack consistency in everything you do?"", ""Your teachers say you're intelligent but inattentive and your grades sure don't reflect this so called intelligence"". Sigh. I just struggle with standardized tests. If I like a subject, I do great at it, but I only like things that interest me and if they don't, I can't even focus for three minutes on them. If I play computer games online I get lost for hours in them and forget to eat, sleep, pee or study. I felt like a complete wreck who's so incompetent that he can't even work towards his own future goals. I'm so ambitious and now people are telling me I'll never amount to anything at this rate. Even after seeking diagnosis my dad doesn't accept it, he says I'm finding excuses for a lifetime of slacking off and they don't want me telling anyone about it."

Not even gaming or doing the things I loved interests me anymore. Trying to start on something is like trying to light a wet match. I've always been an in-between person. Neutral. I don't get angry, but I can be irritated by people repeating themselves and asking too many questions.

AskReddit,eopj62e,t3_bsre89,1558765664.0,"Submechanophobia - a fear of submerged man-made objects. Standing next to large ships especially if they're rusty gives me nausea and discomfort. The thought of being in a ship's engine room or walking inside a submarine, especially the noisy part where you hear machines rumbling would give me major anxiety.

 I remember once walking to the cockpit of a modern train, and so I had to walk on a one foot wide strip on the corner around the rumbling diesel engine and I felt its heat against my face and its deafening roar made me want to fade away into oblivion right there. Pictures of submerged submarines or shipwrecks make me anxious and the clearer the water is the lesser its effects. Partial hazy view of the Titanic wreck with the rest in darkness makes me panic a bit. I can't take showers with my eyes closed, I feel like I'm in a sinking ship and I can't breathe. 

 Even submerged smaller objects like diving and finding metal pipes, like I have to get out of there ASAP. I haven't had issues swimming around yachts or fibreglass boats and touching the hull but I can't be underwater near them or see the propellers. The larger the boat the worse it is. The thought of swimming next to the massive pillars of a deep sea oil rig, with them being covered in oxidisation and barnacles would probably make me want to contemplate death. Rusty container ships are horrifying as well. 

Explanation: haven't found one yet. I never had a bad incident underwater or in water, I've always had this phobia for as long as I can remember and it's my only phobia. I can brave heights after some effort as well and those are just vertigo related matters; none of it comes close to this.
