cyclothymia_,fp9lolk,t3_gc5hwm,1588429295.0,"Hey there. 

1. This is not the right place but I’m glad you posted. 

I’ll explain in a bit.

2. Even before reading my advice would’ve been “seeking professional help” is always the better idea. After reading: you definitely need it. 

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Major depression is the first sign you’re not cyclothymic. You might be bipolar 2 or 1. There are subreddits for those. 

2. In either case: bipolar 3 (cyclothymia), 2, or 1: therapy is the best tool to make sure you can find happiness.

3. Of you‘re borderline, you should go to therapy ASAP. The problem with borderline, is you’re against the clock: the longer you go without therapy, the less likely you’ll ever go. 

Borderline is incurable and the only way to go through life with it is extreme adherence to therapy, extreme self awareness and self help. 

4. I want to tell you how proud of you I am for writing. With everything you’re carrying on your back, you’ve shown rare self-awareness and a lot of courage. 

That makes me optimistic because self-awareness is the most important tool at our disposal when dealing with all the mental issues you’ve mentioned. 

And the struggle to keep it through foggy confusing times is a lifelong battle for us, but it’s the ONLY way to win (which is why therapy is so important)."

I put him in time out -> he’s cross with me -> hits me -> I escalate the punishment, and so on in a vicious cycle..."
crowdspark,fp6egdw,t3_gbe999,1588350934.0,"I love this idea, but so far every instance I saw failed (who knows if I’m the problem is bad management or bad idea).

I think even WeWork tried a similar concept for a while which didn’t work. 

Also, wework’s open spaces (where you rent a desk vs. office) seems to not work well (based on 6 branches I’ve seen scrap the open space), so it might indicate that the idea isn’t working.

Also, depending on city/culture, you’re competing with Starbucks and neighborhood coffee places (even hotel lobbies) who offer the same concept for the price of an espresso and no time limit.

If you do go for it and the numbers add up - 

The key in any of these seems to be scale; if you start with one location it’s easier to fail. You need a plan for a large network, and be able to stomach losses for a while.

That being said, I’m not sure the market needs innovation at this point - you might be better off starting a company that copies a model that works (“regular@ co working space) rather than “inventing the wheel” with a huge risk."

3. If your quality is better in a way I can understand and assign value to, I will leave a competitor for you.

Example: if your fabric is better it won’t make me buy clothes from you if your competitor’s clothes look better on me. 

However if your clothes look the same, but I know that your fabric lasts longer - it might get me to switch.

The caveat is: I need to *know* that you fabric will last longer than the brand I currently buy my clothes from."

It’s totally Disney for young adults. 

Legend oriented storytelling, attention to details, fireworks shows, music, costumes... 

The whole experience from buying tickets to planning to bring there is extremely similar."
Tomorrowland,fc05ay4,t1_fbzuckf,1577279226.0,LOL :) they need to have people dressed up as dvlm walking around in the park
Tomorrowland,fbxo2sa,t1_fbxmfn1,1577195491.0,I think their rave is still in test stages. If they are happy with it I won’t be surprised if they will but TML.
Tomorrowland,fbxln52,t3_ef02km,1577193009.0,"I’d like them to work with Disney and make the experience more immersive, at least for the mainstage.

While attention to details is crazy at TML compared to other festivals, it’s really lacking compared to Disney.

I know there’s a copyright feud between the two companies, but I wish they will resolve it and collaborate. Companies like Haagen Dazs take courses from Disney, I wish TML organizers do that too.

Two amazing businesses, and legendary storytellers... I really believe it could be amazing. 

The only show better than TML mainstage imho is the fireworks at Disney (imagine this shit on the mainstage: https://youtu.be/jB0Afdy68GM and it’s even better under the castle, vid doesn’t do justice, just like TML vids)."
