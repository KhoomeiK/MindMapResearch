2) he feels entitled to you and now that he knows you'll have doubts about leaving him, he feels like he can express that without you leaving.

In both cases, he's also on the losing side (he'll end up miserable, possibly alone) and, if he can see that, he may consider going to therapy to check his abusive tendencies.

There's many hypotheses built on the observation that homosexuality is pervasive throughout the animal kingdom. If it's not adaptive for the individual, then it must be adaptive for the group. 

For example, in a group where homosexuality is not stigmatized, males who practice sex will feel closer to each other and protect each other from danger or scarcity. Gay people may also help raise their friends' or family's infants. 

Look up ""kin selection"" or ""inclusive fitness"" - it's a very well established concept. Imagine saying it's a defect that most ants or bees don't reproduce ever. Yet they're clearly not a failure, biologically speaking.

If she wasn't your colleague, and you didn't see her at the workplace, if you just saw her in a club, or doing the groceries, or imagining a very menial time at her home, would you want to date her? I mean yes, she's attractive, but would you feel that she's lovely etc? Cause you know maybe she's just being professional.

I have a personal policy that when I feel attracted to someone and I can't get over it, I tell them that I think they're amazing and, if I'm open to a new relationship and I know they're single, I tell them that I feel attracted and would like to know them more. But this is, as I said, if I can't get over it which I would definitely try with a colleague.

The reasons are two: first, I find it easier to get over a crush if I speak it out. It's a platonic way of acting on my emotions. Second, I find it dishonest (and potentially unprofessional, too) to act according to emotions that are concealed.

Do you think you could try to let her know about your emotions without that meaning that she has to act on it?

""Hey Colleague, I feel attracted to you because of this, this, and that. I realize it's ethically risky from a workplace point of view and that I don't really know you, but I still have these emotions and holding them in is painful/dishonest.

BPD,fmnvebe,t3_fwa760,1586236394.0,"I've been there. I think there's two components to what you're feeling - one of which is healthy and the other one not so.

The first one is needing recognition and attention. We often pathologize these needs but I don't know a single person who doesn't need some amount of these. It's natural - we're a social species and attention and approval are a proxy of solid social network. Don't starve yourself of it for shame. 

The second one is an absurd and fantastic conception of what it is like to be special. This has been reinforced by crazy amounts of media like movies or shows based entirely on someone being special in a fantastic way that has no parallel - many main characters are nothing but that: Sherlock Holmes, Neo (Matrix), Goku (Dragon Ball), Harry Potter.., you name it: it's a narrative trope as old as Gilgamesh. By definition, we cannot aspire to be as ""special"" as these characters. I had to work hard on recalibrating my idea of what's ""special"", eventually departing from the notion that uniqueness equals value, and moving onto choosing my values and trying to adhere to them in my life. Trying to be special contributes to lack of identity because special is only relative to your surroundings, so it means you're constantly monitoring your environment rather than focusing on what feels good for you and nurturing and developing that.

That's a good subjective account of what you experience. Thanks for sharing.

I would like you to note that, if you truly believe those things, there is no way you can be happy or maybe even functional. Right? How can you be happy in a world where you have to make a constant effort to fake an emotion (love) that doesn't exist?

Let's try this trick:

What if you already feel there's no way you can be happy. You never felt love. But you see people acting as if they felt love. Why?

Seriously, try to answer why.

Is it to confuse you?

Is it to give you false hopes?

Is it to mock you?

Why would people act constantly in a way that is harder than just being ""honest""?

What if there is love?

What if you can't believe it because you rarely (or never) experienced it?

It's hard for a narcissistic to imagine love being real because you don't know what it must feel like. Your body is stuck in fight/flee mode.

I think the first step may be to at least remain skeptical: don't think love exists or doesn't exist. Just be open to the thought that it may exist. That sometimes people may be acting with someone else's best interest in mind. It's not a magical thing - it's just how this extremely social ape evolved. You can explain it with chemistry (oxytocin, whatever) or evolution (inclusive fitness) it's still taking place isn't it? It's as real as hatred. Remain open to the idea: you're right anyway aren't you? What harm could it cause to give this idea of love an opportunity?

The way I see it you should want to dismantle your beliefs for your own self interest. Right now you're not yourself: you're a mask. You're a defense mechanism. You're so generic that much of what you are has been neatly described in books to label people (ie., diagnosis). You get a kick by putting people down because you think so little of yourself that you can't get a kick by appreciating yourself.

But perhaps save yourself a lot of pain and effort and seek professional help. I wish I had done it years earlier. I still got out of being narcissistic but I'm not sure how and I can see some things are still obnoxiously lingering. One thing that helped tremendously was SSRIs - without some of the symptoms, everything is so much clearer. I can see things better, not from within a cloud of hatred and alert. You've been smart enough to self diagnose and brave enough to admit it to yourself. Go on and treat yourself - don't become complacent about having a mental illness."

NPD,flw3woo,t1_flv469w,1585538995.0,"What you experience subjectively as ""hate towards society"" is probably the way your envy manifests: does it bother you to see happy people? Do you think every seemingly happy individual hides something terrible? When you see a happy couple, do you speculate about what goes on in private, and how they're putting a face in public and are not really that happy?

Why else do you ""hate"" society? You've come up with many post-hoc reasons as you saw yourself hating and had to present it (you yourself) as rational: we're hypocrites, we are cruel and self-serving... Etc. Hatred is an evolutionary response that stems from FEAR. So understand where that fear comes from to begin with.

I used to be narcissistic and once I've been able to stop all the behaviors that made me label myself as such, I find I'm much better diagnosed as BPD. When I tackle the current behaviors I'd like to change, I believe I'll be better defined as PTSD. Narcissism was a layer of behavior that I came up with early on. It's a maladaptive coping mechanism. So is BPD. PTSD is the real ailment.

You won't like hearing this but you're just hurt, not a psycho. Your psycho-like stuff is just a way to distract yourself from the pain. Which pain? You've probably done a good job at hiding it with your masks, so it may take you long to recognize where the pain is coming from. The ""power"" you describe liking is just an illusion that you can ignore your vulnerability. That's the real tricky stuff with NPD: you convince yourself that there's no problem with you: it's all the others that are fucked up (hence deserving of hatred). It all fits nicely so it's hard to dismantle the lie."
BPD,fltjc0u,t1_fltd8ws,1585475359.0,"I understand what you mean. When I did this, it wasn't about the other person as much as it was for me though. The idea wasn't to ignore the person so they thought differently of me. I did it for myself, and the reward wasn't more attention but feeling more secure because I saw I was less dependant. Then I assumed that, for most people, someone clingy just isn't that attractive.

Good luck! I'm always stuck in a thousand projects. Also has its good and bad things. I'm slowly trying to do less so that I can process emotions."
BPD,flsr0wi,t3_fqwy9j,1585448645.0,"I was like this when I was romantically interested in someone. I did this thing that worked for me but wasn't easy either and I don't think it's a good long term solution, but can help you progress with the detachment anxiety: I used to make myself think the other person would find my lack of messages as relieving/refreshing/mysterious/interesting. I would reassure myself of this whenever it was hurting, while in the meantime I try to get distracted with something. Usually it was work or some other activity I reaaaally can't leave aside. I guess the activity you choose depends a lot on your habits, what you like doing etc. I chose work because I couldn't afford to miss a single hour cause I was broke ass back then.

Also congratulations for getting past the behavior, that's already an impressive feat you can feel proud of, and I think it's the first step before you can tackle the emotions that motivate them."
BPD,flqdxmt,t3_fqgai6,1585390632.0,"Happened to me too.

In my case, it only helped to get to the root of the resentment. That took years (and there's some aspects of it I still don't understand). In the meantime, I had to convey to her that I felt rejection for her. It was tough because I didn't know I had BPD back then so I just felt like a petty, mean, piece of shit."
BPD,flmo7io,t3_fpfoo3,1585290034.0,"Been there. I hated that I realized I wouldn't actually have a relationship with someone (especially women). It was all the same, and that made me feel terrible because I wasn't having a relationship with someone, only with my horniness.

Just try to find joy in actually knowing people. After some time you'll become better at listening (and enjoying it) than pushing (however skilfully) the topic of sex into every conversation.

Remind yourself that sex is not the only thing we're here for. You're shutting yourself off many wonder things by focusing on sex so much.

But most of all regard this as an improvement in your previous depending on sex for self esteem. Now you've gone onto the symbolic knowledge that sex is a possibility.

Ultimately I think you need to tackle the idea that you're only worth spending time with if it's having sex. You have all the rest to offer (and to receive)."
BPD,flfw7t7,t3_foeo27,1585120224.0,For me it's not a hard-set rule but I also experience this and sometimes it's quite frustrating.
BPD,flcvis6,t1_flckiwu,1585048257.0,Maybe keep IM apps? For example I deleted Facebook but kept messenger.
BPD,flckexr,t3_fnx5kq,1585034379.0,"I've experienced this and I'm on better habits now. Like other comment, I tried to reflect on the real reasons why I posted things. If it's for something constructive, then OK - but if I'm seeking approval then I try to seek it honestly and openly. For example, I'll ask my FP to reassure me, that I'm feeling insecure, etc. The key for me is to try to be OK with needing validation. I think slowly I'm valuing face-to-face validation from people I'm more deeply involved with and seeing social media as increasingly pointless and not really fulfilling.

My FP also uses social media the way you describe. She's aware of it and open about it. It helps because otherwise I might be jealous that she's seeking validation from other people. When I become a bit jealous I remind myself she just feels good because she has these needs. She know she's fulfilling these needs using social media and that's it. We are also very open about what social media is for for each of us, and she will not tolerate anything that is beyond a compliment (ie., proposals, clear flirtations with ulterior intentions etc.) so our boundaries as a couple are respected."

BPD,fkte91w,t3_fkkll0,1584515960.0,"You know, being horny is natural. Kinda hard to perpetuate species without that. It's also OK to want (at least some) attention, and no one should make you feel bad about that. If someone tries, they're the ones on the wrong.

You can try what somebody else mentioned - next time you're horny, try masturbating and perhaps this will prevent you from sending nudes you then regret. 

I realized when I was bored before I would talk to girls I liked. I'd say flirty things and let them know I'm available/ interested. Sometimes that would end up on a meeting or date. Some of those times I'd masturbate right after the chat and then I'd immediately regret arranging to meet with this girl. This made me realize it was mostly about the attention. For a long time now I masturbate when I feel like talking to a girl. If I still feel like talking to her after I touch myself, then I know it's not just attention seeking but that I genuinely want to connect with that person.

Please, don't feel bad about your sexuality. Enjoy it and make efforts to understand it."
BPD,fkmwy2x,t3_fjb3cp,1584343355.0,"What if your idea of no filter is the filter itself?

I have a tendency to do what you describe (minus the being dead twice part lol) and I realized it's w self defense mechanism in my case:

1- makes a lot of people leave me alone
2- only those kind/crazy enough stay around

So in the end I'm surrounded by a lot of crazy/kind people (sometimes both). I'd call that a filter. It's ok but good to be aware of it, and what you may be wanting to filter out."
BPD,fkmwofe,t1_fkmvfjr,1584343036.0,"Ah, my main point with that is that we should try to understand that the reasons why get frustrated have to do with ourselves - that we are afraid / ashamed of the other person's behavior. I think we should try to feel compassion for them because that will be a reflection of what we feel towards ourselves - shame is at the root of BPD."
BPD,fkmvfjr,t3_fj2l3g,1584341594.0,Yep. But I think this happens to everyone (minus the splitting perhaps) - have your ever heard if someone pushes your buttons a lot it's because you think you're similar?
BPD,fkmvboe,t3_fjgdhu,1584341472.0,"Can relate. In my case it's not crippling but definitely can induce anxiety.

I try to understand it as fear of the situation getting out of control. I think most of all I fear that some of them may hurt/bother the others.

I've practiced going against this fear and I can only remember once when one of my friends bothered another of my friends. So I'd say it's quite unfounded - most of all I think I should stop taking responsibility for other people's actions.

I hope this helps."
BPD,fkaqaf4,t1_fka42zu,1584016719.0,"Ugh, I'm kinda stuck at this. It's also not entirely fulfilling and, at least for me, it's exhausting. I also feel like it's not entirely myself. I wish I could more organically shift from anger to neutral. I also realized anger is usually there to make me ignore insecurity. I found a lot about what makes me insecure that way..., Maybe OP can try that? You'd be surprised the things that make you insecure (and when you realize how silly they can be maybe they stop affecting you so much?).

What I mean OP is, don't be angry at being angry. Try at least to understand it.

Another thing that may help is people who won't take your angry reactions but will still stick with you. They'll make your angry self realize there's a limit to what anger can get you.

I hope I didn't make you too angry - I for one may get triggered when people give me advice :P"
BPD,fkapyba,t1_fkapmzn,1584016457.0,"I'm not sure about this but I get the feeling that for me it's even more extreme: I make myself believe I'm falling for strong, independent women who turn out to be rather insecure. 

There must also be some of me making them insecure, so it's hard to tell precisely what's what from my point of view. Anyway, I think it's about me feeling attracted to the faÃ§ade of a strong woman that insecure women will put up. I've had to learn to stop and think things twice before relying on my ""crush""."
BPD,fkabogo,t3_fhaj6k,1584000561.0,"Hmmm just my two cents, but many men seem to feel attracted to women they perceive as vulnerable. It could also be that you're wanting to please them and end up acting in a flirty way without realizing, or that your niceness is taken as vulnerability: www.psychologytoday.com/sg/blog/the-compassion-chronicles/201908/how-being-too-nice-can-be-dangerous-women


Again, just my two cents - is it an issue for you?"
