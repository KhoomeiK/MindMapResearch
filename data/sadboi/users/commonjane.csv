.... woah.

EDIT- Well, it wasnt technically ""yesterday"" (writing this on a different day) but it felt like it peaked that day, which is what I meant by experiencing it full blown. 

It started going away yesterday. I shaved my head today because I thought about why I wanted to do it while I was super manic, and I thought ""actually that there's not a bad idea"""

Not to mention they didn't care that much to see your brother for his graduation (I mean, they could have made time after?), and don't even notice your absence at a wedding, even when they invited you.
