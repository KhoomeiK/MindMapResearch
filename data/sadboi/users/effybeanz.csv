The Winternight Trilogy (first book is The Bear and The Nightengale) by Katharine Arden. Frankly the best books I’ve read in a LONG time. It’s a mix of folklore and history, takes place in medieval Russia, has plenty of action, magic, and a well charactered female protagonist who does not exist for then men around her.  The third book does develop some romance, but it’s barely there and the main character’s story is absolutely the focus.

If you really want to put the time and money into it, you can get a sleep study done for narcolepsy- they can sometimes be a sign of that."

If something I would have gotten upset at when I was thin bc I hated my body so much I never would have believed it had thin privilege, but it did. One of the things about being thin or average weight w an ED is that you can use fact checking. You’re a size _, and objectively speaking that isn’t fat. But when you get to a point of being ACTUALLY fat, fact checking doesn’t work. You feel fat and you ARE fat. Nothing makes it go away or feel better. Body positivity is harder in general when the entire world validates your awful views on your body. 

But like I said, before I experienced that I would have been so upset at the idea of another body type having it “worse”. Which is a difficult thing to say because, as you said, all EDs are hell and awful and there’s nothing good or fun about them.
