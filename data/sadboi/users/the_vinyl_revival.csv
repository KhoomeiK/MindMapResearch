The acting is great, but the story, writing, and editing is all awful. The show also looks super cheap to me for some reason, which is odd considering how much money Netflix usually throws into their productions, and how much money I imagine they did put into it.

I gave it 5 episodes and other than Yen's origin episode, which was great, everything else was just a slog. The show is asking for your attention and then not really rewarding it and beyond Cavill as Geralt and the few and far between action sequences it's hard to find the drive to keep watching.

I really, really wanted to and tried to like this, and had high hopes for the series based off of the trailers and hype. But this is almost more disappointing than GoT's final season."

While it's not technically an affair since both parties spouses would know about it, true affairs always start off as just physical - not wanting to leave the wife, etc. Then someone catches feelings and then it shifts into an emotional affair before one or both start talking about leaving their spouses for one another.

Granted, that doesn't always happen and this could work perfectly fine. But for me personally, it sounds like a tricky situation that would likely end badly. The professional sex worker seems like the best outcome."

People are fucking assholes when they can't get their medicines, especially since most of the time there's not much we can do about it. I can honestly say that the job's made me hate people and completely turned me off of retail.

We had a morphine addict whos doc cut the dosage down, presumably to start weaning her off of it. I worked at the three letter hell hole for 18 months and she was on it the whole time, and even before according to co-workers. Went apeshit every two weeks swearing that we had the wrong scrip and that we needed to call the doctor to get it fixed. 

Another lady had a daughter who'd had a organ transplant and would claim every month that she never paid for the same medications when she had, bursting into years even. Then there was the guy I found out hated my guts for no reason despite me not even knowing who the fuck he was.

And those are just a few of many, many examples. Rewarding job when you could help people, but miserable when you get assholes or people who just liked to act an ass."
