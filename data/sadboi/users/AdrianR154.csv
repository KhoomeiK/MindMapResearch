Going back to Origins now is really immersive and interesting in the story, and the combat is clunky and imbalanced and underdeveloped. I like the way rogues feel, but the warriors are really difficult to enjoy playing as, to the point that Alistair is my favorite companion for personality but I can't handle playing him. I set his tactics and let him do his own thing. And then the mages are really imbalanced. It's hard to make the case that there's any viable choice other than sitting back and nuking things with a mage or 2 while your melee heroes run in and die basically."

YangForPresidentHQ,fkzkz5t,t3_flaf47,1584673484.0,Republicans voted against a bill that would guarantee sick leave for the duration of the crisis.
