NoStupidQuestions,fndh8vd,t3_g0wa02,1586869951.0,Iâ€™m loving reading these comments. I have 3 kids under 6. My wife and I are both teachers- she is hourly at a Pre-K with no insurance and I am a public school teacher. We were in major debt from hospital visits/life in general until we got lucky and sold our house after living in it for 3 years. Now we live in a 2 bedroom apartment (triple bunk beds for the win!) and are debt free but are one big emergency or expense away from being right back where we were. Itâ€™s scary and stressful living this way.
