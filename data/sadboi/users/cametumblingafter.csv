> There are lots of people who say ""curl type doesn't matter"" and in this case they're absolutely right.

curlyhair,fmun3o6,t3_fxe1s1,1586394673.0,Could be that co-washing weighs your hair down too much? Honestly your pre-CGM hair looks amazing and if it's healthy as-is I wouldn't sweat it!
curlyhair,fmum5c0,t3_fxbwx1,1586394111.0,"This is exactly what I've been trying to figure out for the past few months! 

About me: My scalp is covered if my hair is dry, but if it's drying in clumps, I look like I'm balding. Even if I have as many as 37 clumps-- but usually I aim for like 15. Diffusing to dry (reducing the bald-time) and then SOTC/fluffing the roots generously usually works. For our hair it's better to aim for volume than perfect definition.

Edit: Or, another option: I have a very soft Korean face brush (manual, not clarisonic) I use once or twice a week and it provides just the right amount of scrub.

Editing again: It could also be the act of using a cotton pad that your skin likes so much, rather than the micellar water! Maybe try washing with a reusable cotton/bamboo pad :)"
