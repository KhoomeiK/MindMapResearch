AskMen,fq5l9gz,t3_ggut9i,1589109665.0,"Speaking as the girl best friend who dated the guy best friend, you need some time apart. If you want to be able to be friends you have take time away from that person to get over them. It sounds silly but do things you enjoy and fall in love with yourself, pick up a new hobbies or develop an existing one. Just don’t bottle up your emotions and find a friend to talk to about it. 
Sorry if this was inappropriate to comment on but that would be my advice. Good luck my friend"

It will always be part of your story no matter what you do, and sometimes you’ll be reminded of it in incredibly painful ways. But in time you’ll come to understand yourself and how that incident affected you. It will always be in the story that is your life but that doesn’t mean that you can’t write new chapters and come up with new adventures. Your new chapters don’t have to have anything to do with the old trauma, but you’ll carry the knowledge with you, the knowledge that you made it through that you can be strong enough to survive. But please remember this is your story, it is what you make of it, and no one can take that from you, don’t let them."

And you’re right, we don’t have to be around each other, but spending time with my boyfriend is significantly more difficult if his family can never be involved. They are often the ones I hitch a ride with to go watch his wrestling matches at college along other things.
There have been a number of times where I told my boyfriend I would not return to his house as I felt uncomfortable there but with time or coaxing I always ended up relenting."

I’m bi and I’ve explained to him the struggle you have when finding acceptance and how painful it is to have someone insult gay people straight to your face. He’s so much better about it now, I told him if we dated and he decided to speak like that I would end things. He understands now, and I’ve seen him come such a long way. Probably why I thought I could get his dad to understand, figured I could educate him so that he would realize why what he said was wrong. I realize that was foolish of me but I also could let someone use that word in my house and think that was ok.
