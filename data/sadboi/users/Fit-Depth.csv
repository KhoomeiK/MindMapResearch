Which he could have done after 5 minutes into polishing he gave up. That's the first time he pissed me off. He is willing to do nothing. And yes I feel bad for him.

mentalillness,fpndx9y,t3_gecm9i,1588759512.0,I'm dragging myself to a new day everyday. And I've decided to do minimal harm to myself. I don't know if depression goes away with time but yes we learn how to live with it. Depression loneliness is now a part of me. I don't feel secure when someone talks to me. I've learned to be depressed. But I'm going to tell you it's going to be better. And you will be all fine one day. :)

SuicideWatch,fo3jzpl,t3_g571be,1587488176.0,"I was a popular girl in school and junior college. I never thought I'd transform so much. When I entered senior college it was a new place with new people around me and I was good a few days but then I don't know what happened with my skin I started having pimples all over my face I felt ugly. I didn't have the courage to look at myself. I stopped going to college a few days and when I attended college I started staying by myself I didn't want people to look at me. Bc I was ugly af. I stopped talking to people/ people stopped talking to me. I sat alone in a class of 60 students. I feared light, I felt comfortable with lights off I didn't want to see my face. But now that my skin is clear and I look much better I'm still not able to talk to people because I've the feeling they've seen me at my lowest. I still a loner it's been two years now. I want to kill myself this is so hard. I never thought I'd end up like this. I've never hung out with friends in two years. I don't have friends now."
