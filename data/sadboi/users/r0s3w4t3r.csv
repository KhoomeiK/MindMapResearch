I recommend looking into trauma, how it affects the brain and how to heal from it. You may have depression but you may also have more that may be related to trauma, and you can heal that.

The pain you’re in now matters and it deserves attention. 

Try to take things day by day for right now. There were times in my life that meant being happy I got out of bed to brush my teeth. On days you’re feeling better, think of some goals and possible small steps to make to achieving those goals.

CPTSD,fqek1x4,t3_giglz9,1589308849.0,"I read all of this. Firstly, I’m glad you found us. I relate to you in a lot of ways, specifically in your feelings because our life experiences have differed. I know what you mean when you say you just thought something was wrong with you. I also felt that way and was incredibly relieved that it wasn’t just the way I was always going to be. 

I’m happy to see you’re able to identify the true causes of your feelings. We behave based on feelings, based on “programming” - learned experience. And you started off on the wrong foot by no fault of your own. I cant imagine the pressure you felt to be “the golden child.” I’m sure your mom wanting you to fix your dad had at least a subconscious affect on you, too. 

Our society has unfortunately normalized trauma as a “part of life.” What everyone seems to fail to understand is that normal does not mean healthy, and it doesn’t mean acceptable. What you have experienced may be a common experience (even if you haven’t met anyone who’s been through things you have been through, there are tons of them out there) but it doesn’t mean that it was “ok.” It doesn’t mean you just have to suck it up. What you’re describing sounds like you have plenty of reason to consider this trauma. It’s good to recognize the source, be more forgiving with yourself as you were a child and it was your parents fault. They did fail you. That being said, it’s also important to balance that with a sense of understanding for them. Not excusing their behaviors but understanding they did the things they did not because of you - but because they had their own issues. 

I also heavily relate to the “smart quiet kid” the “well mannered” kid who doesn’t cause any trouble and the loneliness you’ve been feeling. I’m 21, have also missed out on pretty much every normal social experience I should’ve had by now. It sucks. And when you’re lonely, and have nobody to depend on and you finally have someone, it makes sense that we would become codependent. Of course this doesn’t mean we don’t try to work on this issue, but it has an explanation. I know for me I’m in the current situation where I’m also too codependent on someone. And I’m aware I need a larger “net” but it’s hard to build that at this age - and especially so when every “first person” gets scared because of my intensity. 

You mentioned not knowing why you took your loss of friendship harder than what happened with your dad. And I think you answered it yourself. If I’m wrong feel free to correct me as I’m not trying to impose my view onto you, but take this as something to consider - your friend was your first experience with everything you were lacking as a child. All you knew was the pain your dad caused, it wasn’t a big deal because that was “life” to you. But you had actual proof, not just promise or talk, that that’s not all there is, and that the love you have always needed and deserved is out there. A good, simple way to explain this is you can’t truly miss something you’ve never had. 

You also mention feeling apathy at traumatic points in your life. In my opinion as we continually go through trauma after trauma with no support before or after, we learn that there’s no point in expressing pain because it will not be attended to anyways. Sometimes holding it in is too much, and one way we could respond to that is by turning off. I’d say that could have begun as a child and that’s why you were seen as so “well mannered.” That’s how it was for me. 

I apologize if I’m being overly presumptuous. Please know that I say these things aware that this comes from my personal experience and it may not be at all how you feel. That’s okay, too. 

Regardless - I see that you’re in pain and I’m very sorry to hear you were treated this way. You aren’t alone in your feelings and experiences. 

You are not what you’ve been through. I know it may feel like these things are your fault, that you don’t have any control over the past and inherently your feelings and behaviors. And you can’t control the past but with time you can heal, which will help you have more control over your feelings and behaviors - and the first step is realizing what is real vs what you were taught, and the second step is reaching out which you’ve done with this post. 

Unfortunately the hands we’ve been dealt are very hard ones, we have been given a responsibility to raise ourselves - a responsibility that never should have been ours. But it is possible."

offmychest,fpue6qr,t3_gfkx82,1588910706.0,"I hear you. I’ll address firstly the whole remembering some things quite clearly and others fuzzily. That’s very typical of trauma and I think it happens as your brain wants you to remember some things so you can avoid the danger in the future, but blocks out a lot of details that may not be as relevant or information that is *too* painful. I barely remember any of my childhood. What little I do remember were the times I was feeling a lot of pain.

Secondly, you’ve been through a lot, and you deserve/d better. I also have very complicated feelings concerning my mother but it’s in a very different way than what you’re describing you went through. What I’ve learned is it’s important to let yourself see the gray area. Yes, she did awful things and truly failed you as a mother what sounds to be most of the time. Thats on her. But as you said she did give some moments of warmth to you. That was the same person, and we are all capable of acting in such polar ways. You can miss her knowing she hurt you, and you can feel any type of negativity toward her knowing she did show love at some points. 

In the same vein - children’s minds usually separate the concept of their “mean parent” and “nice parent.” It’s almost as if they could be two different people to them. I’ve found even in adulthood I’ve experienced that. Loving my mom and idolizing her for the good she’s done - completely ignoring her flaws, or only seeing reasons to hate her. Like I said, knowing that there’s a middle ground might be helpful. 

She also was your mother. People are capable of developing attachments to captors, let alone the person they’re biologically programmed to be attached to. I think for some people, even if their parent was nothing but abusive, they may “miss” them in the way that they grieve over what they could have had. They miss the small moments when they did feel loved by their parent even if that was for unhealthy reasons. You can still feel loved by being abused. A parent is a parent and everyone craves their parents approval. Even if they go on to completely hate them, that’s because they wish things were different, they wish they’d been loved. 

I’m sorry if this isn’t helpful or doesn’t make sense. I was giving examples of my experience just in case you could relate, so I hope I didn’t blab too much about myself. I do hope you find healing, you didn’t deserve to be treated so poorly."

offmychest,fptsjpw,t3_gfhzvg,1588897399.0,"Not saying you have to believe this of course, but my idea of god is less of an identity, and more of a feeling. I do see it as love, and there are things in our lives that may be awful to us, but good to some. That being said, I don’t think this version of god is going to work “in our favor” because it’s not possible, what we want may be at the expense of others. There is no objectively good and objectively bad. God, to me, is less of an over seer/orchestrator and more of a common thread in us all. I think if we tap into that piece of ourselves is when we can find more and more peace in our lives. And if we all did it the world would be a better place, because we would all have more compassion for ourselves and one another. 

But the thing is love isn’t forceful. So this part of us isn’t going to claw through. We have to look for it. Love in my opinion is inherently neutral. 

Idk if this makes sense. I do consider myself agnostic because I could be totally wrong but this idea makes the most sense to me because I really do believe there’s something more to everything. 

And it also doesn’t make me awful when bad things have happened to me because my god isn’t going to interfere. It just isn’t. I have to access that mindset in me and do what I can in my situation to find peace. And sometimes that doesn’t mean changing the awful circumstances. It means adapting, accepting. Because that is what love is. It’s coming to terms. 

Sorry if this sounds woo woo... I admit I used to be but I’m not now. I have a more scientific and biological way to approach this idea, too that cuts out the whole “energy” talk. But we’re talking about who or what god is and I think If there is something, this is it. And this is the most clear way to present it in terms of spirituality/religion."
offmychest,fptqkpy,t3_gfi26e,1588896269.0,"Hey, I read this. In high school I was extremely confused about my sexuality. My best friends were girls (I’m a girl) and I had mad crushes on them. At first I think I said I was only romantically attracted, then only sexually. And idk when it happened but it stopped mattering to me. If I meet someone, connect with them and like them, I’d probably not care about what’s in their pants. I’ve only ever dated boys and I’m young and I’ve only ever been with one girl sexually. So I don’t fully know. I know I have the capacity to love both, and my sex drive is highly dependent on my feelings for the person. So I have just stopped worrying and tried to see where it goes. Rn I’m dating a guy and may never be with a girl.

I’m not sure this will work and I know it’s not easy, but try not to pressure yourself into a label. I call myself gay because who I’m attracted to isn’t that big a part of my identity.

I think how you feel is a reasonable thing to feel about this. You seem to recognize that there are worse things to go through but that doesn’t mean you can’t feel the way you do. It can always be worse, and it can always be better. Just because someone is starving in the world doesn’t mean you’re not hungry. Their starvation won’t fill your stomach.

I guess for example, TW here, I’ve never been raped but I’ve had incredibly uncomfortable sexual experiences and experiences that I just felt pressured to do or I pressured myself into. That being said, I wont say I completely relate to someone who has been raped. But sometimes people who have mention feeling things about sex that I feel too. And I may not and probably don’t feel it quite to the extent, but the feeling is the common ground. 

It’s also important to remember that trauma is defined by the person who’s feeling it, which is why people who’ve never been through anything horribly “traumatic” can still be traumatized. 

But you are right, that people probably are using it not even really considering what it means. The examples you gave definitely sound like they’re ignorant to the actual severity of the trauma they’re claiming to relate to.

offmychest,fpdrt7d,t3_gcvzgh,1588532938.0,"I want you to know I read this. I don’t claim to know exactly how you feel because what I’ve been through is nowhere near the severity of what you’ve experienced. But I do relate to the disgust you feel at even the mention of anything sexual. I’m sorry the adults around you did not do more to protect you. I imagine it’s incredibly difficult to not have an outlet for this pain, to not have anyone to hear you. I am glad you reached out in some way, and I’m glad you want help though you are scared. I mean no harm by this, and I don’t know if this is something you have access to or maybe already know about or even tried. But assuming you don’t know about this, I recommend looking into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It’s often used to treat PTSD/trauma and I’ve been in CBT for a few months now and I find it to be very helpful. My therapist is incredibly validating, gentle and sensitive to any triggers and how her behavior and language could affect me. And I think most CBT therapists would be trained in that way. 

On the other hand, I am 21 and I would be open to talking/listening more if that might help. Absolutely no pressure though, it’s just an offer. I hope you find healing soon. You deserve it."
CPTSD,fpc09ge,t1_fpbojgz,1588483584.0,"It does make sense and I completely agree.

This is actually something I’ve been aware of for a while and it’s frequently come up in therapy, even before I started dating him. I think that’s largely why I am not really angry at him. I know the source is truly that I need a wider support net as you said.

The main issue focusing on him is that when I express the need for more support from other sources and making it clear I don’t expect him to do it all - he still feels not good enough. It scares me because even when I tell him Im not saying he needs to fill those holes, it doesn’t matter and we run the risk of him getting over whelmed and leaving. I don’t have control over abandonment and those are both separately triggering. Anyways, that is just me venting again and I’m sure you understand that. The solution is still that I need more support from other sources. 

That all being said it’s a struggle in and of itself to find support. I don’t want to just keep making excuses, but there are a lot of other factors in my life that make finding support very difficult. The specific factors don’t matter because underneath it all I am held back by fear. I was raised to be afraid, and that on top of ptsd just makes taking risks impossible. I have a lot of trouble with accountability and responsibility, there are lots of things in my life I desperately want to change and I have the ability even if it’s difficult. But my fear will always convince me why I can’t. And I can logically know otherwise but it’s never enough. As I said I’m in CBT which seems to be helpful but I’m starting to wonder if this really is just about forcing myself to do it even when I feel I cant. 

I don’t want to make excuses. I feel my best bet is trying to take risks in baby steps but the pressure is difficult because I am in need of support pretty much asap. I also don’t think there’s many ways to take baby steps. I’m not asking these questions thinking you’ll have the answers. Im mostly just thinking out loud I suppose.
If you have any advice I’m open to it. 
I truly appreciate your response, I can tell you put a lot of care and thought into it. Thank you for listening."

offmychest,fp6byga,t3_gbcixj,1588349709.0,"I think it’s important to be aware of how you’re feeling, but also be aware of where you’re at. You yourself are a kid. It’s good that you’re attracted to those in your age group. I am 21 and the idea of being with anyone more than a few years younger than me is not at all desirable and makes me pretty sick. But my boyfriend who Is also 21 and I do switch between dominance and submission, where the submissive one is usually quite innocent and child like. I am attracted to child like qualities but the context of knowing he’s actually an adult, and is mentally, emotionally and physically mature is crucial. 

I do have my own opinions about hentai with young children, and while I don’t think it’s good to normalize it in any way, even if they’re not real kids - I would rather people be using that for pleasure than real child porn or abusing children themselves. And again I’d say it’s probably about context. I’m sure for some it’s about the fact that they’re childlike but they can feel attracted to it because they know nobody is in any danger. Nobody is actually getting abused because they’re cartoons. 

At the end of the day, just pay attention to who you’re attracted to in real life. As long as they’re not much younger than your current age, I think you’ll be okay. If it gets to that point though, get help. I think pedophiles need to be able to get help before they offend."

I definitely think a lot of doctors are only their for the money. They don’t actually care, Sometimes even if they do, they may not know what to do.

I get being bummed but if it’s any way to guilt you, that’s a warning sign. If my boyfriend doesn’t wanna have sex and I do, of course I’m bummed but we don’t need to dwell on that and I am an adult and respect his feelings. I’m not gonna be angry and I’m not gonna pout. You absolutely should not have to have sex if you want to. His love for you shouldn’t be conditional in that way. And honestly maybe you’re not liking sex because of how often you have it and how often you have it when you don’t want it.

And even now Im not sure what it means to grieve. Holding it in for so long has been exhausting too, so I know what you mean. 

Be kind to yourself, be patient. I know life gets in the way of taking care of ourselves all too often but do so where you can. Sleep if you need it. If you can manage a snack, that’s better than nothing. It’s okay to take small steps into this almost new sort of life you’re entering. Take the time to adapt. 

And like I said, express. Sounds cheesy but literally anything that moves the feelings outside of you. Write, talk, cry, scream, paint, sing, run. Movement is especially good for releasing anger. Crying and talking are probably low physical effort things, since you don’t need anything but yourself to do those things.

Sorry if this is regurgitated, corny information. But I think sometimes we forget our emotions have purpose and it’s to get us to react a certain way. Expression allows for that need for reaction to be satisfied."

There was a time span I found it very difficult to look at him. My mom did a lot wrong, too. The other comments are right to say it’s between them but you absolutely can feel how you feel about it. I don’t agree that it shouldn’t affect your relationship with them, because how could it not? I look at both of my parents differently because of what they’ve done but it doesn’t mean that I don’t love them. They’re ultimately human and people do really stupid and hurtful things sometimes. It does change our relationship and that’s okay too in my opinion. I haven’t disowned them. 

I’ll always remember what they’ve said about one another. When someone makes a hurtful choice, it’s hard to forget. People can change though, and that’s important to remember too. 

When people make mistakes you don’t have to excuse them for it. You can forgive, which is different. You can adjust boundaries in a relationship. There is his side to the story, too. But again - nothing excuses something like that. He can only explain.

AnimalCrossing,foaapqk,t3_g6irdc,1587643299.0,"Forgive my rant. 

This is a gameeee. Why the developers so mad? Like almost everything in the game is tedious and becomes a waste of time, it begins to get difficult to enjoy. You can’t bulk craft, you can’t bulk buy. You get the same long dialogue for things you do regularly (asses fossils/donate.) the upgrades to things are incredibly expensive and you often have to wait a day for things to progress. Terraforming takes hours and hours, and you can end up regretting your choices of building placement and have to shell out more money. Getting all the items in the game, all the recipes is enough tediousness I’m my opinion. It’s mostly based on luck, too! They’ve made all that so difficult yet interaction with villagers just isn’t as special anymore. It’s quick and easy. Sure, they’re cute as hell but the grumpy, snooty villagers are not grumpy or snooty. They all basically have the same personality. They start out nice and get annoyed the more you talk to them which is the opposite of how it was. Again, so much in this game is so difficult but you don’t even have to win your villagers friendships like you used to. 

And now just because people are time traveling (which I don’t blame them!!! I’m an adult who wants to enjoy the game but frankly I don’t have the time to with all the obstacles.) the people who don’t time travel get even less of an advantage. I’ve time travelled once in my month of playing, just one day so I could get terraforming. 

Why can’t we play the game how we want??They’ve made it monotonous enough in ways that are so easily avoidable. They’ve got so many cool well thought out details but they didn’t think it would be annoying to have to go in and out of the dressing room to buy multiples of the same clothing type? Are we really supposed to believe they overlooked bulk crafting???? 

Yeah, right."

mentalhealth,fo9up2a,t3_g6j1x7,1587631825.0,"I recommend researching ideologies with the intent of being skeptical but open. There’s tons of videos on YouTube on the matter. I’d say believe what feels best, but make sure you are aware of what that means for you. 

I personally started out as a Christian kid, I honestly don’t think I ever believed in it though. My mom grew up baptist and my father catholic. They let me believe what I wanted. My mom became spiritual christian and my dad is now atheist. 

I’ve come to settle on agnostic. If there was anything I ever believed in it was spirituality. It was very important to me and shaped who I am in a very positive way. It was not theistic for me though, so I don’t think I’d say I’m not at all spiritual. I float between spirituality and atheism, leaning toward atheism most of the time. 

That being said I stand firmly for my beliefs and I do actually actively think a lot of the religions out there are way more damaging than anything. I actively think they need to go away. I am not afraid to say what they are but don’t want to give you any bias lol. 

Be careful and remember you don’t have to decide on anything yet. I know this is cliche but you are young and finding spirituality can take a while."
depression,fo8s63c,t1_fo8qagr,1587602723.0,"Not everyone experiences all symptoms to a high degree. And there is a good chunk of people with ptsd who don’t have flashbacks at all - flashbacks are rare. 
I went 7 years being misdiagnosed with just depression and anxiety when I actually have ptsd and adhd. I personally think it’s partly because mental health professionals find it easier to say people have depression and give them drugs and depression usually isn’t something you can completely heal from, because it is partly biological. Mental health professionals are just people, people with schooling, yes, but they still have room for human error. And not every doctor actually cares about their job. 
Secondly a symptom of ptsd is downplaying your own emotions. I thought everything I was feeling was just life and I had to suck it up, I was just weak - which caused my depression because living life in fear nearly every moment is miserable. But it turns out those were not normal feelings. And they’re not part of depression but they were never properly acknowledged by both doctors and myself. I was a kid, too. In the environment that was actively traumatizing me - I got the diagnosis of depression and it made sense. (Actually it took me attempting suicide for any doctor to properly acknowledge I had depression.) I didn’t question it because I thought I could trust the adults and doctors in my life, and nobody else did either until maybe a year ago. 

Also ptsd has ways of hiding itself. It often worsens when you begin to go to therapy and become more associated with your body. There are people so far removed from their trauma they not only don’t remember but it primarily shows up in physical symptoms that are random and seem to have no cause. Because of this they’re also likely to never even seek help in the first place. 

There’s truly a myriad of reasons people would be diagnosed with depression instead of ptsd. And as I said depression is a symptom of ptsd so I wouldn’t say they’re entirely different. Quite frankly ptsd has a lot of overlap with things like depression, BPD. PTSD has plenty of symptoms that can be misunderstood without the context of other symptoms, which again might not be addressed."
