I'm thinking of getting Ketamine treatment for $3800. I've called the suicide hotline 4 times in the past month. They asked if I'm going to harm myself. I say no. They say to keep taking my meds, and see my therapist. I've been doing this for 13 years. I will never go into a mental hospital. I've already been there to visit my parents. It's a joke. The system is broken, and so am I."

I know the squirrels probably have a nest of babies, and they don't want any cat going up there to eat their children or eat themselves. I used to watch through my window and security cameras, and would always see cats staring up at the wall at a squirrel, and the squirrel was telling him off, because the squirrel felt threatened. 

Also, there was a type of bird that would make an angry chittering noise if it saw a cat on the wall. This type of bird would dive-bomb a cat. Like, the bird would literally fly straight into the cat to try to knock it off the wall. Does anyone know what type of bird that would be? I'm just curious. If I heard the bird noise again, I would be able to identify it, even if I didn't see the bird."
