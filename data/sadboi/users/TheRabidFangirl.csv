No brain function is normally called ""brain dead"".

It can be classified as a person when it can survive outside of the womb. Not without any care, that's being facetious.

Child support isn't the same as carrying a pregnancy. Child support is not a punishment. It's paying to care for a child you created. Abortions stop a pregnancy before it reaches that stage.

Child support is also not life-long, but the effects of pregnancy can be, and often are."
AskReddit,fmwtxqx,t1_fmwsknp,1586452977.0,"I understand that. But, scientifically, they're absolutely wrong. The fetus isn't a person yet.

That doesn't change the fact that what it accomplishes is giving someone else rights over someone's body. No one, not the man in this situation or (if one really believes the fetus to be a person) the fetus has the right to use the woman's body."

AskReddit,fmwti55,t1_fmwsmim,1586452757.0,"Two reasons:  First, it's not really a person yet. Nothing that we would consider vital to being a person, such as a functioning brain and nervous system, exist. We would classify a grown person lacking a brain to be dead. When most abortions occur, the conceptual has no consciousness. It's an unfeeling cluster of cells, sometimes with a very primitive sort of heartbeat.

Second, because the conceptus itself has no rights to the woman's body."

Basically, someone was looking to hire a writer to write 60,000 words a week for only $50. Not each. Total.

I'm a professional, I write quickly, but that would still take me a week to finish, plus overtime. All for, once the fee from Upwork was taken out, $40. Fuck that.

I'm still peeved by it."

AskReddit,fmwr210,t1_fmwlfg5,1586451518.0,"Being pro-choice is about having bodily autonomy. The right to choose what you want to happen to your body.

A man doesn't have a say because it's not his body. Simple enough. You can't have rights over another's body."
AskReddit,fmwqtdd,t1_fmwnunb,1586451397.0,"Pregnancy is a possibility every time you have PIV sex. When you decide to have sex, you take on that assumptive risk. This is true of both partners.

It comes down to not having rights over someone's body. Let's use a real world example. My mother needs a kidney transplant. I have two healthy kidneys. Even if it meant she would die, and I could live just fine with one, no one can force me to give up use of my body without my permission. My body belongs to me.

Pregnancy is the same thing. The zygote (what most abortions are classified as, also called conceptus) has no brain stem, no nervous system. It has none of the hallmarks of being human, and can't continue developing with appropriating someone else's body.

It's an identical concept to my analogy above.

Is it completely fair? In some ways, no. A man might really want the baby, and might grieve the pregnancy.

But the man also does not assume the risk of pregnancy. They do not have the changes (sometimes permanent) that the woman does. They don't have to live with the pain and health burden. They also don't chance dying during pregnancy and birth, which, while not as common as in the past, still happens a lot. Basically, no risk, all reward.

Because women have a greater stake in that regard, we should also have more of a say.

(BTW, I would absolutely give my mother a kidney. She just refuses to accept one from me.)"
AskReddit,fmwpf3q,t3_fxhwj2,1586450695.0,"I agree with confidence, cleanliness, and being genuinely a good person.

I would add two things:  First, see women as people, not just potential partners. A woman shouldn't lose value in your eyes because she doesn't want to date you.

Second, be willing to talk to unattractive women, too. A lot of unattractive guys tend to completely ignore unattractive women, and don't see the irony there. If you want someone to see past your looks, you need to do the same."

I broke up with him, and just felt... relieved. Thinking of how close I'd come to legally binding myself to that clusterfuck. He's now living in his parents' backyard, in a camper he doesn't own, with a truck he doesn't own, no GED, and absolutely no job. When we met, he lived in a house he partially owned, had a steady job (even a great job once, that came with insurance and everything), and was studying for his GED. I even paid to take him to Disney World on hia first real family vacation.

I'm glad to be out. And I'm grateful to his sister.

(By the way, his family took my side.)"
