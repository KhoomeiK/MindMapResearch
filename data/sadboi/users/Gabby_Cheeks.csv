parrots,evd297o,t1_evd1t1k,1564428503.0,"Well you want him to get used to your hands, the beak on parrotlets is really small and won’t do much damage. The technique for picking him up though is typically only used for when you absolutely need to pick up a bird without injuring either party. He’s probably built up a fear to hands honestly. I’d try putting your hands near his cage gradually or try hand feeding some millet. My bird would bite because he was anxious and scared he didn’t really want to hurt us. He will still bite sometimes if he gets over stimulated. I’d try hand feed though and teaching him to step up. You’ll be able to read his body language better from doing that and build up an understanding of when he is going to bite. :)"
parrots,evd1l9f,t1_evcxwhp,1564428083.0,"Start training him more, my bird used to bite me a lot. I have the same breed, and you have to work with them a lot. Take him out more and put him away every time he bites. You don’t want to give a reaction unless you’re bonded to him because it’ll have a negative effect. When birds grow up they have other birds “yell” at them when they play bite too hard. When birds don’t grow up like that they don’t know what they are doing is wrong. 

I used to use the technique of putting my bird in his cage immediately after for 15min then I’d take him back out. You have to pay no attention to him though or else it won’t be effective. 

If that doesn’t work I used this method where I would Gently twist the hand he was on to set him off balance. It doesn’t harm the bird in any way but it does make them uncomfortable enough to make them not want to bite you. Birds don’t like being off balance so a correlation of biting=uncomfortableness starts to form. I only do this immediately after he bites me though, and only when he’s actually biting! A lot a birds like to play with peoples fingers so you need to recognize the difference of playing and biting and not make him feel uncomfortable to use his beak. It’s practically an extra arm for them.

Anyways hope that helps, he’s really cute 😂"

If you don’t want to deal with the stones and stuff anymore I think it’s worth it to get them taken out. It’s only 10 days of moderate to severe pain to never have to bother with it again. When they take out your tonsils it is very unlikely that they could grow back, therefore you shouldn’t ever get stones again. My health insurance covered the surgery so I don’t know how much it would be for you. I’d check your insurance and look at the copay you have and such. Good luck"
