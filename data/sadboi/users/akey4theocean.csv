I have a feeling, after a lot of things come to light following  Covid, school systems are going to have a hard time with keeping their teachers. Their good ones anyway. I am sure not all schools are this way, but the theme in our school system is to look good, make sure your students perform above.  Who cares about the mental health of students and teachers. You have to go above and beyond. The more you brag, post your adorable creations in twitter and show off all of your wonderful “innovative” teaching, the better you are. 
Screw what is best for students (I am speaking from admins POV, not teachers)."

“If your friend bought a Dunkin Donuts franchise, would you not support her?  MLMs are the same and for you not to support your friend because she works for an MLM that is f’d up. —-what you are doing when you support your mlm friend is you support an entrepreneur badass who busts her butt off and she is a hero—-for you not to support her is f’d up and drives me wild”
No Liz. Money not coming to your pocket drives you wild. She also posted a screen shot of some oils and quote “Is money the issue? Then ask your mom, sister, best friend” Ugh. What a con artist scammer. 
I paraphrase since I can’t remember it all. But go watch for yourself. 
I just can’t believe how much of a narcissist she is. And to be honest I’ve NEVER seen her post about helping the less fortunate or doing anything positive. 
Oh shit. My bad. Her sharing the benefits of oils is her helping this world. What a hero. You go bossbabe. 
F off Liz. She knows the influencer community is on its way down, her husband doesn’t work ( well, he is helping her brand 😂), and the oil craze won’t last forever.

Edit: just saw her claim that if she hadn’t shared the oils and introduced them to progessence (?) plus, then these women wouldn’t have gotten pregnant. So now they are claiming these oils get you pregnant.  These people are sick."
