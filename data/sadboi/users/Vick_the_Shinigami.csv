heartbreak,fj5i6ic,t1_fj5gyk8,1583033281.0,"Damn, I feel the same, when I watch a movie and two people start kissing I just think about how I miss my ex so bad, because I never stopped liking him and I have never been with someone else since we broke up too. I feel so dumb about pretending about moving on, it feels good for a moment but then it all just explodes onto our faces, u know what I mean. I miss hugging him, he was the only person I liked to hug, his hugs were amazing for one hell of a skinny boy hahaha, and his lips were just like, made for mine, the perfect fit, just like two pieces of a puzzle that belong together...

I don't have any friends to talk about this and the ones I kinda have are tired of me.. I only have psychologist on Saturday tho, I am looking forward to it but until then I don't know what I will do, cus all I do now is sleep, cry and binge eating (sometimes. thankfully I have a fast metabolism).

But ye, it's nasty and I hate this but I just can't move, I can't find the strength to do it... right know I am laying in bed in my pajamas (which I have been all day) and if I can remember I don't take a shower for 3 days now even tho I thought about showering many times through my day.

I am really sad about this cus it just makes me realise how low I am... I can't even study for my tests, I can't even text my friends ( like the only 2 or 3 friends I have right now that are always busy ). So I think I really get you, and I hope you get better cus I will try too, one day."

We instead of wedding cakes talked about our house decoration... and he told me that I was what he was looking for all this time and finally discovered me, the one with the exact likes and dislikes he had. 

Now he is totally gone, told me he would always be here and that didn't want to lose me as a friend cus I am really special for him and never loved someone so much. All lies. He is now happy smoking and making money with his weed and fake friends. But it's his choice and I respected him because I love him..."

My life was always pretty miserable and when this person appeared was like everything was a dream. I had never been that happy and I had suffered from depression already. And then, it all just went down and now I have again a severe depression... my life is pretty complicated in terms of school, work, ""friends"" and family.  He was my first boyfriend too... when we broke up  I lost everything cus he was everything to me, even his family.

I learned with my ex who said constantly he loved me (even when I asked him to moderate it cus it would lose is value and true meaning making it less true and turning it into one more casual word) and guess what... he left me with no reason, almost no explanation. If he really loved me he wouldn not do that, he would have tried everything to fix things. But he did not. Nobody falls out of love in less than a week. So he never loved me in first place. It was all just 1 year and 2 months of lies.

Ofcourse I can't say that I Know what you are feeling cus we all feel different about everything in our lives. I have been doing worse about my depression because I lost the most important person to me not a long time ago. Not because they're dead but because they wanted to leave... wich makes me feel even worse and think about ""Damn am I really that shitty?"". What I can say is that it's normal that in some stages of your live your friends play a little psychologist role... I am afraid as well that my friends will get bored of me, eventually, some of them already have been showing that they are bored but if they are real friends they will stay, they will try to help you and most importantly wait until you get better. I, myself find the suicide idea appealing too but I am trying my best to hold on to the things I still have like my dog and delicious food that I wouldn't eat if I was dead haha... going to the movies, drink a cup of tea with cookies while I watch the rain fall... some times, this things don't make me happy either but I start thinking that one day in a while they do and that I want to be alive that day. Try to make a list of things that you appreciate too! And look forward to enjoy them more frequently!"
