AsianParentStories,fnix7pk,t3_fsdh9d,1586987970.0,"sorry about this, but I'm just a bit sad because my parents don't take my mental health seriously. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have been given medicine by the GP, but since that's happened they think that after taking it for a few months, I will be cured, and the don't understand that it doesn't work like that. I am always told to pray whenever I feel upset and whenever I try to open up to them about my mental health deteriorating, they just try to change the subject or they ask me ""What do you have to be sad about?"" and it's just upsetting. Not to mention, I feel like such a disappointment for dropping out of university due to my mental health. I can feel that they're disappointed in me, it just sucks because I tried my best but they think I could have tried harder and stayed, even though I have told them that I was so close to taking my own life. 

I am doing better now.

Stay safe everyone."
