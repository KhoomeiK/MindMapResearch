Just like Gypsy Rose case showed a lot of flaws in US system to assure people's safety at least I hope that Eugenia's 5150 incident and death will also help to improve the detection and actions to save someone with a mental problem.

It's not that Eugenia's problems are not a subject of concern for the people, it's just that there's a language barrier so they don't ever look at her content or the news in US.

I did see news about Eugenia in my country and people just said ""God help her"" because that's all they can do, wish her the best. I actually never saw any news about Marina Joyce, only about Eugenia.

EUGENIACOONEY,fpe6t4d,t3_gctzuh,1588541505.0,"Took me a while to find the user with so many comments but I did, poor girl is extremely malnourished. If you continue reading her responses she says her ex literally broke up with her because he was more attracted to Eugenia, if that is true that must have messed her up pretty bad.


She mentions how she's alone and nobody cares about her, she's suffering from a deep depression and I'm afraid she shows suicide tendencies as well, poor girl I hope she gets help, I looked at her Instagram and she looks like someone who loves art and has a lot of potential in life.


This is what I hate about Instagram (and why I never created an account), influencers pretend to have a perfect life and fuel people's depression and insecurities with that. I don't have an ED but I suffer from depression and those type of profiles really affect me as well."
EUGENIACOONEY,fpe0r00,t3_gcqktk,1588538061.0,"I was already isolated before quarantine and this pandemic has definitely affected me bad, it's not the same not going out just because you don't want to than ""if you go out you can get infected and die"", even when I order everything express I get paranoid about my packages being infected and things like that.


I guess Eugenia must be going through something similar, specially when her mom told her she has a ""weak heart"" and she also panics when she thinks she lost her purse. Her mom clearly fuels her anxiety and during this pandemic it wouldn't be strange if she's also telling her about people dying or getting infected."
EUGENIACOONEY,fpdxnst,t1_fpdoupq,1588536299.0,I assume OP means the photos of poor blood circulation.
EUGENIACOONEY,fpb1tei,t1_fpayntl,1588460323.0,"You can notice the blue in an old video where she removes the nail polish and shows her natural nails, since everybody pointed out the concerning color she hides her natural nails as much as possible. I can't really tell from that stream though, I think it's too far to be sure of something."
EUGENIACOONEY,fpb025e,t1_fpadk6v,1588459282.0,"And the fact that authorities didn't take the red flags as serious as they did ended up allowing Luca to kill somebody, this is was I'm afraid with Eugenia, I'm not saying they are going to murder her but they're definitely helping her to die."
EUGENIACOONEY,fpazrr5,t3_gcblyl,1588459114.0,"The tricky part is that people is focusing on her ED, I personally think her ED is just a symptom of something more serious which is family abuse. But taking legal actions against someone and accusing them of abuse is far more complicated than a 5150.
I'm sure she's held captive, physically and/or psychologically, but proving that is going to be very hard."
EUGENIACOONEY,fpauhfk,t1_fpamry6,1588455963.0,Maybe she's trying to ask for help? She usually just avoids the subject as much as possible or hide any sign of ED but this time she was showing the marks over and over again like wanting people to see them.
EUGENIACOONEY,fp9nm4x,t3_gc6hh9,1588430586.0,Did she say she is going to film with her mom again?
EUGENIACOONEY,fp937wk,t1_fp8xw9b,1588412588.0,"I think you're forgetting that her whole hands look red, not just her wrists, watching her hands AND wrists with the same red color makes more sense than just comparing the line in the wrists which btw, it DOES happen to me with soap, so yes, dermatitis can be linear."
EUGENIACOONEY,fp930xg,t3_gc2mzx,1588412370.0,"I'm not saying that it must be dermatitis but also we cannot discard the possibility just because we are *assuming* how an allergy should look like, all skins react differently and also there are different forms of allergic reactions so it's possible it can be an allergy.


Now having said that... There are also allergic reactions to certain types of ropes or metals, you know..."
EUGENIACOONEY,fp8x1b6,t1_fp8rf6x,1588405986.0,"Yeah the amount of irritation is not normal, I know she's pale and that makes red more obvious but for me it looks like a wound, it's very concerning."
EUGENIACOONEY,fp8tylo,t1_fp8tqdx,1588402900.0,"Actually I'm allergic to strong liquid soaps and in my case it only get my wrists irritated (all of it), that's why I think it could be the soap (hoping it's not something worse), I think it's because depending of how you wash your hands you keep some leftovers of the soap mostly on the wrists. But well I'm just giving a possibility, we all react differently to certain products after all."
EUGENIACOONEY,fp8tekn,t1_fp8tcc9,1588402372.0,"That depends of how she washes her hands, some people never wash above their wrists."
EUGENIACOONEY,fp8tapb,t3_gc1mrp,1588402271.0,"I saw her last stream (actually is still on live while I type this) and someone asked her about her hands, she said something like ""I don't know it has been very dry these last days, I think I might have a reaction to the soap""

I noticed she's touching her wrists a lot, I don't know if it's red because she's touching it too much or she's touching it too much because it bothers her.

I don't know maybe she's too scared of the Covid-19 and she's compulsively washing her hands out of fear?

Edit: freaking mobile format."
EUGENIACOONEY,fp6vbuq,t1_fp5u1w1,1588359213.0,"She doesn't care, on the contrary, she LOVES it, she's proud of her appearance and of being an inspiration, I know that's her illness controlling her, but we have to accept she lost empathy long ago."
EUGENIACOONEY,fp4enar,t3_gb5g6q,1588297416.0,"I once saw a comment on YouTube saying ""please wear a red scarf (or something like that) on your stream if you are being held captive"", many other people is suspecting the same thing but with thousands of comments Eugenia probably missed it or just ignored it, if her family is involved in something serious they probably read her social media accounts such as Twitter or Instagram so contacting her directly won't work, maybe Reddit could be the place to do it since this is just for gossiping and Eugenia doesn't have an official account, if it doesn't work we just won't get a response and that's it, it might be worth to try."
