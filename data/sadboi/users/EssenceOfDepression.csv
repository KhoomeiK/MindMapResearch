there was this girl at my school who came one day in tears because her brother committed suicide. 

Our school was recently dealing with a SUPER nice kid who killed himself. He wasn't bullied, he actually was loved by literally EVERYONE. He was super nice and kind to everybody and everyone was his friend. He had a horrible home life that no one knew about , until it was too late. So everyone was devastated when we came to school one day only to find out he hung himself.

They announced the girls loss on the speakers, we had an assembly, the whole shi-bang. So a few kids who knew this girls mom, decided to call her to try to give her some comfort and to ask when  the funeral was. The mom was like 'wdym?? \_\_\_\_ isn't dead. I don't know what you are talking about' so the kids explained everyhing, everyone was confused. So the mom ended up coming to the school to explain to the principal that she was lying, everyone found out by the end of the day. 

The girl had to change schools because everyone was SUPER pissed at her. 

That's why I started hating when people do stuff like that for attention."
AskReddit,evfnunz,t3_cjorkk,1564498575.0,"My dad is a science teacher at a middle school, and every year he has to take 'roll call' of all his electronics and equipment ( he pretty much reads the serial numbers on the back of everything to see if they match whats on the list of serial numbers.) 

I was supposed to read the serial numbers off of the projector on the ceiling. I stood as close as I could without standing on a chair, I couldn't see it still. The projector was probably 7 feet off the ground. I am 5'5, so I wasn't that far away from the little numbers. 

so one of my brothers comes over ( who is shorter than me) and reads the numbers perfectly. 

so yeah. now I have glasses the size of windshields."
