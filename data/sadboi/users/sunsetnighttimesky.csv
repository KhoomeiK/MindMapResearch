Anxiety,flff8vp,t3_fo6h6w,1585105073.0,"My anxiety has been pretty rampant 24/7 ever since the outbreak and one of the big symptoms is it makes my body feel warmer than usual so I automatically think I have a fever. I’ve been feeling like that on and off for about 2.5 weeks now, I check my temperature a few times a day and no fever. I do remember anxiety making me feel like this before, it’s just my body’s response to being stressed from anxiety and such but boy does it suck when it’s a symptom of the virus lol."
Anxiety,ffyszhd,t3_evm7q7,1580354382.0,"24 and going through that right now heavily and have no clue what I want for my future and it’s giving me horrible anxiety and depression every day, it sucks. I’ve worked in the same industry for 4.5 years now and I do enjoy it to some point and I tolerate it but the pay isn’t great and it’s too cushion-y which I fear will make me unprepared for a more professional job later on. As others have said we are lucky to have our young years to figure it out but I don’t want to waste them too, so my anxiety makes me want to figure this out overnight which is impossible. Maybe if I find a better paying job that is still tolerable then I’d feel better, who knows. I hope you find some relief from your anxiety OP, I’m desperately trying to find it too."
Anxiety,fefo0eo,t1_fe63njn,1579060540.0,"Sorry for the late reply but that’s a great outlook on a new week and regarding work, definitely going to keep that in mind, especially me making a few mistakes at work today and dreading on it a bit but realized it’s all good in the end :) I hope you can take a day off too or something of the like to refresh your mind and give it a rest!"
Anxiety,fe5xo9t,t3_enwaek,1578877247.0,"Yup I go through it every Sunday, going through it now. I like my job and tolerate it, and tomorrow I’m doing something different than my normal job tasks all day which happens to be a lot easier than my normal job, so I don’t have anything to fear yet well here I am lol. Only thing I have to look forward to is I took Friday off for a mental health/refresh day, so there’s that. All I can say for help is we just have to keep calm, get through tomorrow and get into the mindset that we made it through Monday and it’s a start of a new week, we can get through it!"
askdrugs,f9sljgv,t3_e6mn49,1575594684.0,"I take it to calm down from anxiety attacks or if I feel one coming on. I only take 25mg and it works for me, takes around 30-45mins for the full effect but calms me down a lot. Only makes me a little bit sleepy, but others take it as a sleep aid too and makes other people really tired. I guess it depends on the dosage and it affects others differently, but it’s been a real big help with my anxiety. I take when needed."
Anxiety,f7js3fh,t1_f74246m,1573785071.0,"Sorry for the late reply but do you still experience it? I've seen other people say it goes away after a while. I went to the doc today and he checked my throat and didn't find any swelling or anything wrong, so that's good at least. Just sucks my anxiety is doing this, makes for a constant uncomfortable feeling lol."
lexapro,f62ohdb,t1_f62lxhz,1572663936.0,Oh I’ve been on lexapro before last year but I’m actually going through marijuana withdrawals now so my body can’t handle that on top of the initial side affects of escitalopram haha so I’m holding off on meds on the meantime.
lexapro,f62lsji,t1_f62jjfw,1572662241.0,"Interesting, but thank you for the information! Had a feeling it’ll be a few days for it to subside."
Anxiety,f5zhl83,t1_f5z4lsg,1572577136.0,That's awesome to hear that combo works for you! I've been walking more this week whenever I feel anxiety bouts coming along so hopefully I can keep my hydroxyzine as backup.
lexapro,f5yxnib,t1_f5ypokc,1572563209.0,"Yeah I heard people waiting multiple months and it eventually went away, some it didn't sadly. I can't remember how long it lasted for me but I feel if I had it before it'll happen again :( But I'm really happy it cleared up for you!"
Anxiety,f5ru29f,t1_f5rk2d3,1572403033.0,"That’s awesome to hear those two mixed together works for you! Sadly weed is starting to do harm for me and I’m kinda scared to smoke again thinking it’ll induce an anxiety attack again. I do however want to try CBD tinctures, to see if that can give me quick relief. But yeah definitely take the thc in low amounts to play it safe, I hope you find a lot of help with that on your journey for relief!"
Anxiety,f5qrrya,t1_f5qilpm,1572381937.0,"Absolutely! And yeah that’s a great outlook, if the meds can help you stabilize your daily mood and push aside your anxiety that’ll open the door to allow you to get stuff like that done! We also have to remember, I need to tell myself this a lot, but it’s fine taking the help from meds, however long it may be, months or years, and the slowly ween off of it and hopefully you can have things figured out and also have coping mechanisms in place for your anxiety. I appreciate that truly so much, best of luck again to you for what you’re going through and I’m absolutely here always if you need to talk as well!"
Anxiety,f5qhvlk,t1_f5qfkvd,1572377356.0,"I totally get that, I’m really scared of what could happen once I’m back on them and if it’ll alter my mood or make me feel like a zombie again. Luckily when I had days I didn’t take my meds (just forgetting to take them) it didn’t affect me badly. I thought I could toughen up and deal with it on my own but in my case I was wrong, I need the help from meds now to function daily and I will continue to find ways outside of meds to help my anxiety. It’s a crappy feeling to give in to meds but it’s never a bad thing if you’re at wits end and you need the help. I truly wish the best for you on what you decide on!"
Anxiety,f1xlv9e,t3_db118r,1569800322.0,"That’s me right now and pretty much every Sunday night :( I honestly don’t know why sometimes, especially for this week. I know I’m dreading a start of a new week, so there’s that, but I can’t think of anything else and here I am on the brink of tears for no reason. I know I’m not getting any sleep tonight..."
depression,eww06hf,t1_ewvyqzb,1565817642.0,"I get that, it’s hard to find that in-between but it’s totally fine to take lazy days and just do nothing, even though you know you have stuff to do. I’ve been doing that lately and I think it helps a bit, if we overwork ourselves and try to keep our minds occupied 24/7 it’ll just end up bad. I think you should try to throw in lazy days into your mix and see if it helps, we all gotta give our minds a break, especially with all the shit we deal with daily in our minds. Best of luck to you!"
depression,ewvx3zs,t3_cqcnfs,1565815797.0,"Well two months seems very short for a lot that you did, maybe you rushed into a lot of things and maybe are feeling overwhelmed? And overwhelmed that some stuff didn’t work out so it seems like everything won’t. I would give it more time, take it slower and lower it down to just doing a few things, it takes time. Especially the socialIzing part, maybe you just met some not-so-great people in those two months, but that’s a short amount of time. You have plenty more time to meet new people and make friends. 

I also hoped that having a lot of change and distractions would help but it left me being overwhelmed and overworked, I did that this whole summer so far and it’s been eh so far, I think I just need to slow it down and take it little."
depression,ewr8xbp,t1_ewp1xok,1565698756.0,"Feel the same way with weed, it became a crutch after just doing it for fun and it does help but I’m becoming too reliant on it. I stopped taking meds so doing this shit on my own is difficult and it’s hard not to smoke and escape. Fucking meds made my mind want to rely on something to deal with the pain always. Doing it alone is a tough battle."
Anxiety,ettoqoq,t3_cdecvb,1563190632.0,"Same for me! Absolutely love the rain for sleep, relaxing after work, hell I would’ve loved some rain today after work to relax my anxiety as I’m having a horrible Monday morning already. I hope your day is good today!"
DecidingToBeBetter,etc840c,t1_etc58qk,1562678147.0,"Yeah I could be better off it with, honestly would enjoy having the portability of laptop so I’ll definitely consider it. That too haha I just think taking away the ability to game and getting away from my setup will help and then self control is for sure on me to work on. Thank you again for your insight I appreciate it!"
DecidingToBeBetter,etc3shc,t1_etc374j,1562674364.0,"No thank you for your input! I think I feel a lot of it is that I custom built it and all so I feel obligated to use it and maintain it but I honestly don’t even want to upgrade it anymore, gets too expensive and I’d rather spend my money elsewhere. Yeah the tv was a bad example haha but like I feel doing anything other being behind my screen is where I want to be at, even if I’m not being productive so to say."
DecidingToBeBetter,etc3ckn,t1_etc2uu6,1562673934.0,"That’s great to hear! Happy you realized your issue and that you worked to turn it around, did it take a lot of self control to get away from your PC? I feel like I struggle with that a lot and why just selling it all can really help me release."
Anxiety,esghwkw,t1_esgbdrl,1561953521.0,"I couldn’t imagine doing strict deadlines for stuff at work, luckily I don’t have to at mine. You definitely will feel better once you’re out of there I’m sure."
Anxiety,esgbbhs,t1_esg1vt2,1561948180.0,"Yeah my job is honestly not that bad work-load wise and pretty low stress, so I’m thankful for that, just new weeks suck so much for me lol. That’s great you’re going to hold out a little while longer and I wish you the best of luck with your passions!"
Anxiety,esfyyt3,t3_c7isr1,1561938612.0,"Same here, dreading leaving my gf tomorrow and going through another boring work week. At least I have the 4th off and I’ll be with my gf then. Sucks this happens every damn Sunday, I just get so depressed. Hope your day has been going great though!"
depression,ep6vhrj,t3_bu3reg,1559074059.0,"I get like that a lot, almost every weekend. I have a great time with my SO or friends or I get things done I need to do, and once the weekend is over I just break down, a lot of times I don’t know why. Sometimes it’s because I miss my SO or I get upset that my mental “break” I have on the weekend is over (when I’m with my SO I don’t feel anxious or depressed, it’s a wonderful thing I get to let that shit go for a while) so you’re definitely not alone. I’m struggling to figure out why, I’m just guessing it’s a part of depression, and I have had depression for 10 years now so I guess it’s the norm."
