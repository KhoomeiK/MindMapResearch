mentalhealth,f54dm3d,t3_dmnym6,1571978553.0,"When I’m happy I’m always the one lifting people up and cracking jokes basically the class clown, it was algood during school but over the course of my life and shit happening I’ve been struggling but faking it to my friends and people I meet so I seem like it’s the same old me and I’m happy. It’s exhausting to be honest so I’ve tapped out and now my close friends know what’s up. Talking is the best thing I did 👌🏽"
depression,f4vs0us,t3_dlup1w,1571846960.0,"Sounds like we’re both having our quarter life crisis!

Happy birthday mate and have an incredible day, be selfish today and do you! All the best"
depression,f4vrnsm,t3_dlp6ws,1571846810.0,I’ve been going through so much lately that I’ve lost so much weight to the point my friends and family think I’m on meth.  I feel so sick and literally every conversation I’m either saying “what was I saying again?” Or I’m speaking too fast and trying to get 10 things out at once.
depression,f4vhk0q,t1_f4v07id,1571842572.0,"Thanks! Good to hear, Very addictive personality to anything that makes me feel good so just trying to channel that into healthy long term choices and not short term temporary fixes. Something that resonated with me after years of weed is that yeah weeds a great way to numb the pain and forget but eventually that even starts effecting you’re life and when you stop you’ll eventually wake up to the chaos around you. Picking up the pieces now all the best 🤙🏽"
depression,f4uf27z,t3_dlfw2v,1571808067.0,"Hi there, high functioning depressive here pretty exhausted as always and yeah I too get all those thoughts but try remind myself it’s just the voice in my head who’s going to tell me I’m shit and worthless no matter what I do. I’m treating him like friends now....if he’s keen to stick around and do what I’m doing cool. If he’s not and only going to make it harder then CYA. I’ve found inner peace with myself and spent the last 5 years relying on people to make me happy and continually trying to please them. I’ve found out if you are yourself and stay true to it you’ll attract the right people you’re just not all there yet or in the right place and that’s ok. Once you start to better yourself that voice will see it too and decide yeah this way better let’s be positive it’s way less exhausting. But now I’m high on life and can’t sleep ? You win some and lose some I guess. I’ve been a “going to” person most of my life and always going to do this and that now I’m just actually doing it and amazing things are happening. I just wish you could feel the same and get that hope ive got because I know exactly how you feel and as always don’t let someone tell you you’re wrong for how you feel. Stay safe"

depression,f4t9ihw,t1_f4t8efb,1571785716.0,How come? Failures don’t define you bro. It’s so cheesy but true how you deal with it is what counts and the longer you do that the better you’ll be. I spent a good portion of my life feeling crap because I couldn’t do what other people liked. I’m doing what I enjoy and it really doesn’t matter if I’m good or not if I enjoy it no one can say shit really. Obviously it’s easier said that done and I don’t know what you’re going through but just know people have overcome it you can too. Stay safe
depression,f4t81xr,t3_dlpzaj,1571785139.0,"I know what it’s like to think like that, I went solo travelling and wound up in Japan and long story short came pretty close to blowing the whistle, and I’m so glad I didn’t because I’m only seeing how much love and support I’ve had this whole time now, I bet you’re brains lying and your a great person. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise 🤙🏽"

depression,f4r5u91,t1_f4r45lj,1571763194.0,"So for example right now I haven’t slept since 5am yesterday morning and it’s currently 5:44am and I’m completely wired I have so many things going on up there. 

I’ve lived in cities all over North island New Zealand so I have friends spread all over and my job can be done anywhere pretty much, it’s also pretty sweet can get anywhere I need in under 4 hours drive. I don’t necessarily need to go places I just do it I think I like the idea of driving somewhere and my brains like ok we are going from here to here that’s all we gotta do, play music listen to podcasts etc. I like the idea that with a few exceptions everyone respects eachother on the road or sea etc because if you don’t you die. Why should it be any different with every day life. 

Just keep doing you I reckon, I’m still figuring that out myself"

depression,f4qymf0,t3_dljpkh,1571760054.0,"Wow that sounds awfully similar for my situation, always been able to sleep 8+ hours mood always generally good. Then after years of shit basically I’m at a point now where I can’t sit still i never watch tv or play video games anymore I barely enjoy weed it just makes me cough now and I’m constantly doing something. My friends and family worry sometimes and try to get me to relax but I think shit maybe my brains making up for lost time and really thirsty for knowledge etc, so why not roll with it. Yeah I forget to eat sometimes and I’m up for over 15 hours and LOVE driving now. On a mission my minds busy it’s not thinking or overthinking. Maybe try channel your busy brain into positive things that will only better you !"
depression,f4qxhuy,t3_dljqgu,1571759579.0,"I would rather be hated for who I am than loved for what I am not, they’re not good genuine friends sorry and you’ll meet plenty of them. I bet there’s a lot of people at uni in the same boat. I really struggle with new situations and I’ve always struggled with confidence issues. But I’ve learnt and really worked on just being myself meeting new people etc and seriously people are far more interested in themselves to worry about how you’re not this or not that. I never went to uni but I know a lot of my mates felt the same had high expectations and they just faded out and moved home. Don’t have to follow the crowd find things you like and surround yourself with like minded people. Social clubs, social sports etc. long story short a lot of what you’re saying sounded like me and I was in denial for Years. Who me? Nah no reason to be sad you’re fine. I wasn’t fine and admitting it to myself and others was one of the best things I did 🤙🏽"
depression,f4qw3ta,t1_f4qbo46,1571759055.0,Whoo! Nice one go Cardinals. Close enough Not far though I’m from New Zealand.
depression,f4qauc1,t1_f4qaar3,1571750671.0,"What I mean is, some people are right in the sense you feel guilty if you’re happier and doing good because you know how it feels and then you see and hear people doing worse then you. I’m pulled over on the side of the road right now replying to you with cars going past. I don’t care. Where do you live ? If my comments on the internet ain’t doing anything let’s hang out. I travel the world I like it. I’m sure we’ll cross paths"
depression,f4q66xg,t1_f4q4d4x,1571748571.0,You ever sat back and thought why you hate yourself ? Is it something people are saying ? Is it the person you are? Either way you’re not to blame and you’re struggling. Sadly I think it’s different for everyone so there’s no one fix all solution. It’s a combination of things within yourself to make yourself happy. Sound a bit corny but just find your self bro! I’m sure you’re a cool person and I genuinely would hang out with anyone given the chance. 🤙🏽
depression,f4q23ag,t3_dlh14h,1571746757.0,"I would grab my family (dog included of course) and say you need to chat, say you’re absolutely exhausted you don’t feel like yourself and you’re not getting enjoyment out of life and you’d really like some help. If you’re not hurting yourself because you think they would be upset it’s because you’re right. They’d be heartbroken. Just like I would. Get some help mate and get healthy. We need to see those good qualities come out in you because they’re being held back right now! Keep fighting strength in character is a great quality you have. 👌🏽"
depression,f4q0rg8,t3_cml6ni,1571746144.0,"Hey guys I’ve recently started posting on this forum after lurking for years. I’m having a really tough time writing this as it’s all so fresh, excellent child hood, cruised through high school got along with all crowds great confidence etc, ended moved away video games for 2.5 years all I did was go gym twice a day (weights) eat and play video games walked my dog on the beach, I spiralled into a shell of a person I hit a low point picked myself up got a job 3 years of hard work later threw in the towel left my job broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years whom I just got a house with left before I finished my trade went travelling drugs + alcohol for a few weeks realised I made a huge mistake begged for her back she didn’t want me tried to pursue her for 6+ months just sat back let her do her thing when it was actually killing me inside because hey I dumped her right? We ended up talking again and she wanted to see me overseas so I went and saw her she set me up treated me so nice first week then it all changed and she absolutely destroyed me and ultimately I went home rock bottom devastated did the whole thing again got a job decided to finish my trade 4 months later finally being happy with my great group of mates and family she comes back says it all different she’s so sorry didn’t realise blah blah blah I get back with her because A. I bloody love her B. I was weak.  Fast forward 6 months toxic terrible relationship worst I’ve ever felt lost my job dismissed in a very nasty outcome I lost 15 kg my mind and any reasons to carry on. believed I genuinely wasn’t good at my job I was the problem in the relationship it was all my fault etc. Last Monday I lost my job, last night I broke up with my girlfriend of over 4.5 years. And cried for 6 hours until I slept. 


Ive sat back and decided what I’m going to do, Ive made goals a plan I’m taking it step by step I’m trying to eat food regularly, I’ve got a new job lined up after a few weeks holiday with a guy I know who’s great, I’ve seen a friend every day this week and to be honest I’ve never felt better ever since I was about 18 years old. I have achieved more in the last week than I have in the last 4 years of my life. I am a quarter century old, I’m going to look back and be so happy I didn’t waste it till 30. I’ve wasted half my 20s and made a lot of terrible decisions in my life and thank you to who ever is looking out for me where ever you are. If it wasn’t for such a great family and friend system I really don’t think I would be here. Sometimes you need to be pushed and hurt so much to make the decisions you truly want. If I had any advice from all of this I’d say be a bit more selfish especially when you’re younger. You won’t know what you truly want until later or maybe you will but don’t let someone or something hold you back from that. Stay true to yourself because you’re the best judge of yourself no one knows you more than you. Keep your family close and good friends close also. I treat everybody the same now no matter what until they show me otherwise. If anyone ever wants to talk or anything no matter the subject time day weather what ever I’ll reply when I can. I’ve realised I’m a people person and I get joy out of lifting people up on my level. Let’s all continue to fight the good fight and remember even when we feel our lowest and no one would even care there’s people out there who would. I AM ONE OF THEM. Don’t make a permanent decision on a warped idea made up by a liar in your head. Im genuinely so happy and seeing things so much clearer and please hit me up so I can try help you see the same. 

I’m so greatful for the people around me who pushed me into the right decisions, I’m no professional by all means but I sure can give you a lot of yes no’s and maybes about my situations. All the best! Not long until a new year I know we can start at anytime but next year can always be the one year that starts it all. 

🙏"

Keep fighting talk to mates, family, professionals follow the advice cause so many people have been there done that and I’m telling you we all posses the same ability to be happy."
depression,f4p5pji,t3_dlc8bp,1571716828.0,"I’ve been all around the world and worked in some of the nicest houses in the city’s I’ve lived and I can assure you money and material is not the answer, they’re some of the unhappiest people I’ve met. Although to be fair when people say money doesn’t buy happiness I always think yeah sure but I’d rather be crying in a Ferrari right now. You sound like no matter where you are or what you’re doing you genuinely won’t enjoy it right now and that’s fine.....could simply be chemical imbalance in your brain, or someone making you feel this way. OWN IT! No one can tell you you’re wrong for how you feel and when you realise that you’ll find great peace. Good luck ❤️"
depression,f4p507o,t3_dlc0dt,1571716216.0,"I felt the same as you, thought it was stupid and pointless. It was only after I stuck at it I was finding that when I offloaded to my therapist instead of overthinking and trying to deal with it in my head I catch myself forgetting about it as my brain probably thinks it’s dealt with. Just like writing a list your brain forgets it because it knows it’s written down somewhere. Talking is so underrated! I wish I knew that from the start and did that properly instead of all the crap decisions. All the best and good luck going forward 🤙🏽"
