depression,f761229,t3_dsgdf3,1573421551.0,"the best description of my life starting from this september tbh  
i like school in general, i do feel tired sometimes but ig it\`s not that bad  
however, i hate this everyday monotonous routine. every day is the same. there is not difference at all. i wake up early, get ready, go to school, go home, do my hw and go to bed. i do my best in studying because i really want to enter a good university. but that\`s really excausting.  
i used to have so many friends but almost everyone left me (basically because i simply don\`t have time to go somewhere ''you became so boring'', ''why can\`t you go with us?? ugh''). there are a few friends but we aren\`t that close ig  
i am almost always alone. hate that.  
i had to give up my hobby because of school. so i don\`t really have any interests rn.  
what about my family? do my parents love me? yes. do they care about me? absolutely yes. do they need me? nope.  
so basically no one needs me (that\`s really the truth). i truly think it would be better if i wasn\`t born.  
so yeah i don\`t really have friends, hobbies, attractive appearance and so on. all i do is studying.  
ik that no one will read it but i just wanted to let it out."
