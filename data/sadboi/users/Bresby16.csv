If your unhappy in a relationship, leave. Show your children that you can co parent and have respect for each other.
Enrages me when people having affairs, blame other people for breaking up the marriage/family because they gossiped! 
They expect people to protect their marriage/family. But dont stop sleeping around!  .... oops sorry for rant!"

If anything recognizing your differences should highlight how worthy you ARE! 
It sucks now but you will look back and be thankful you dodged a bad one with him!

One bit of advice I would give you, take some time to learn about YOU! All the time and attention your willing to give a partner apply it to yourself! When your happy and confident in yourself it shows.
THEN, if you decide you want someone in your life. You will know your worth and won't take anything less than you deserve! ( which is a lot) good luck OP!"
