I'd say a 2070 Super would net similar results. I'm averaging 35-40fps with everything cranked to the max. Which isn't great, but keep in mind it is the Beta, things are bound to improve by the time it makes a full release. It's actually stable, no lag or frame drops/microstutters etc."

My suggestion: keep your ps4 and save $20/week for about 4 months. That will put you at about $320.00. Then you can buy a Switch and have both.

It also has built-in dust filters on both side panels, however temps are in the 30-50°C for the CPU and 50-60°C for the GPU.  The cpu is an i5-9400f with a Noctua NH-L9i Chromax Black cooler.

xboxone,fgevbue,t1_fgeluue,1580711384.0,"Xbox Ones are surprisingly easy to work on. Just be careful with the brackets holding the outer shell to the base. They're only made of plastic, at least on the original Xbox One. Not sure about the One S/X."
buildapcforme,ffzh1mh,t1_ffzgm2l,1580378723.0,"Thank you! Keep in mind, if you're getting either the Ryzen 5 2600 or 2600x, they don't overclock RAM very well as the Infinity Fabric limits speeds pretty bad. Should be able to get at last 3200 with that kit I linked. If you're willing to spend 170US on a 2600x, you would be better off buying a Ryzen 5 3600 as they're much better architecture/IPC/performance. The 2600 should be enough for what your dad needs though, I don't see him needing to replace it for a lot of years. Just DON'T buy the 2600x or 3600x, they're much more $ for very little improvement in performance. If I were you, I'd buy the regular Ryzen 5 2600 and that kit of 3200 G.Skill I linked, and spend the savings on more storage, as your dad probably won't notice the difference between the two CPUs. He most definitely will notice an extra gig or two of sweet storage space though lol.

Edit: I noticed you asked about the cpu cooler/case fans. Yes, those two Noctua fans should be more than sufficient to keep the whole thing cool. Just put one on the front as intake and one in the back as exhaust. It doesn't get much quieter than Noctua, those are excellent fans. I've used them in several builds before and they perform very well. You definitely won't need anything more than the stock AMD cooler that comes with the CPU since you're not overclocking. :)"
buildapcforme,ffzd25w,t3_evzt2e,1580372963.0,"Here's a setup with a Ryzen 5 2600, 2.5TB of SSD storage (500GB Samsung Evo Plus for Windows, 2TB Western Digital Blue 2.5"" for everything else), three 4K IPS monitors, 32GB of 3200MHz RAM, and an 8GB RX 570.  I chose this GPU as it has enough ports for the three monitors, and won't struggle with a triple 4k setup if you're not using it for gaming. I didn't include a CPU cooler, as the boxed cooler included with Ryzen is more than adequate for your dad's use case, should run nice and cool with the two Noctua PWM fans. Other things to note: the case I picked has USB 3.2 Type A ports on the front, and I threw in a Blu-Ray/DVD/CD burner. I think it may have gone over budget by a few dollars, since I'm looking at USD prices here in the states, but not by too much. Good luck with the build man.

Unfortunately, even the most robust of built-in laptop cooling solutions aren't really adequate for extended gaming sessions. I can personally say from experience that a good laptop cooling pad with fans can help keep your laptop's temperatures closer to 50-60°C. I have an older gaming laptop I use when I'm on the road occasionally. I use an Enermax laptop cooling pad with it and it really works. There are several companies that make them, good luck man!"

From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."

intel,fa9ywh3,t3_e8540v,1575897174.0,"I'm running 3×Noctua NF-F12 3000 Industrial fans  pulling through an NZXT Kraken X72 as intake in the front of my case. Max temps during an 8-hour p95 stress test (zero AVX offset)  are under 80°C with a 5 GHz all-core OC on my 9900k. If you're unhappy with your temps, try the X72 with one more of those fans. I'm not using a fan curve, just have fans set to 60% constant in the BIOS. Good luck with your build man! Looks great!

Edit: I just realized your case will only fit a 240 aio or maybe a 280? Either way, an aio with those f12s should lower your temps considerably."

The 9400f is a decent gaming CPU, and hard to beat for the price. I got mine bundled with the ASRock board above for only 160 at Micro Center, not a bad deal."

I had a GTX 1080 sitting in the box after upgrading my main pc to an RTX 2080.  I've set the PC up to automatically log into Steam BPM, and I have a Steam Controller on the way that's scheduled to be delivered today.  I figured it would be the best way to have a ""console pc"" to replace the Xbox One, but retain the ease of use.

When I looked on my account details to check it has tracking  info now.  I ordered one controller and nothing else on the 27th around 9:30 am PST.  So maybe you'll still get yours?  I'm pretty sure everyone who had their orders canceled was refunded and got the cancellation email within a day or two."
buildapc,f97veap,t1_f97r5a6,1575170747.0,"Here is the cheapest build I could come up with that includes a decent CPU and a dedicated graphics card.  I would advise adding an extra 50-100 bucks and doing it right, and this will open up many other games that would be unplayable with integrated graphics/ an iGPU.  You could save about 10 dollars by switching to 2x4GB RAM instead of the 2x8GB modules I went with... but at the current price point, double the RAM, and a decent speed to boot I would personally go with what I listed (it's only 10 dollars more).  Hope it helps, and happy building!  I hope your son enjoys his new PC!
