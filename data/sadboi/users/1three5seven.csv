EatingDisorders,fhs3cse,t3_f4j14v,1581851788.0,I think you should tell your husband so he can help you work through it. Maybe it's 8:30 and you're hungry but don't want to eat. He can have something too so as to normalise it. He could maybe take control over what you eat and when for a day or at least make eating more enjoyable

EatingDisorders,fhoor5o,t3_f48c4l,1581768123.0,It isn't wasting time to get help. It's a legitimate reason to get treated and the doctors and nurses have most likely treated multiple people in your situation before. I've had a friend go through this and it really helped them :)

AskReddit,fgow55l,t1_fgouv9g,1580989291.0,And it's still technically draining resources anyway bc people on death row often wait years and years until execution

AskReddit,fgosdz9,t1_fgos5jf,1580984280.0,Very true. The crime rates in countries would also affect it
AskReddit,fgos4tu,t1_fgorvem,1580983931.0,"There can be political motive behind arguing both sides. From a non-political perspective, if you are prepared to go through with such crimes that result in the death penalty, you would also be prepared to die. Their motive for committing the crime would already be much greater than any deterrent effect of being executed"

AskReddit,fgort5c,t1_fgorlze,1580983477.0,Actually there is scientific consensus that the death penalty does not deter potential criminals
AskReddit,fgorqfg,t3_ezq83l,1580983368.0,"I believe that nobody deserves to die, no matter what the crime. I am a firm believer in rehabilitation and giving life sentences to the worst offenders. The death penalty doesn't discourage people from committing crime, and in the cases of serious crime, death would be the easy way out. The offender (if they can't be rehabilitated) should have to live with the reminder of what they did."
