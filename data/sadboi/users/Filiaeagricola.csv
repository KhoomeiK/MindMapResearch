AskMen,fqjk1w5,t3_gj18u3,1589411048.0,People sitting and resting on a machine I’m waiting to use. Maybe even playing on their phone. There are benches for a reason.
Spravato,fqjjc9h,t3_girgss,1589410764.0,"I’ve done both Spravato and ketamine IM. Spravato pulled me out of a deep depression, and ketamine is keeping me there. I don’t have to do ketamine as often as I did Spravato. With insurance,price is comparable for me."

MakeupAddiction,fpe96kt,t3_gcurin,1588542865.0,So creative!
AmItheAsshole,fpcrmsz,t3_gcj097,1588510748.0,"NTA. People who know the”flower language” are a tiny group. It’s unrealistic to expect the rest of us to be up on their weird hobby. She should be grateful for the gesture like a normal person. And calling you a dyke is reprehensible. For someone so sensitive, she sure ignores your feelings."
grammar,fpbhbym,t3_gcee2y,1588470016.0,"Correct: “Did you see me?” the teacher said. 

Don’t double-punctuate. Lose the comma before the closed quote."

Spravato,foouvlv,t3_g8oitw,1587946965.0,"For now, they require an antidepressant in addition to Spravato. But your psychiatrist probably has a lot of discretion about type, including atypical ones."
Spravato,fo9146q,t3_g6dnxp,1587608186.0,"A medical assistant always monitored me. I had a doc visit beforehand to check in, but that was it."
TalkTherapy,fo8s82t,t3_g65fgs,1587602756.0,Ending the session early doesn’t feel right. Mine says he’s there for me and I don’t need to do anything to get him to be with me — even talk. Ending early feels punitive.
TalkTherapy,fo7e6cz,t3_g5y912,1587576810.0,I had a therapist who was glued to her computer during sessions. I don’t know whether she was taking notes or shopping online. She became my former therapist pretty quickly.
grammar,fo1hmtz,t3_g55sqa,1587433482.0,Yes
Spravato,fnxyijl,t1_fnxxmnl,1587349148.0,"So great to hear from you. I’m doing OK. I’m a homebody, so I’m not taking quarantine as hard as some. The thing I miss most is in-person sessions with my therapist. Depression seems to be mostly at bay, although not completely. To be honest, I may never be “normal.” And this coronavirus upheaval kinda makes it hard to judge, you know? But I’m still so grateful to not want to die every day like I did before. 

How are you? Any updates?"
MakeupAddiction,fnxp9cu,t3_g4gl5i,1587343442.0,Beyond words. Brilliant work.
memes,fntbp9c,t3_g3muiu,1587238461.0,I don’t like prime numbers. Divisible only by 2 is second-worst.
TalkTherapy,fnmetfy,t3_g2hekk,1587070143.0,Such a good use of therapy. My therapist says part of his job is to sit with me in my emotions. It’s powerful.

TalkTherapy,fmwyz2k,t3_fvr550,1586455505.0,"I’m in Central Texas and have been doing video sessions since March 24, twice weekly. I worry a little about privacy because my husband is working from home, too. Video sessions are OK but just not the same. It’s hard to replicate the in-person connection, and I miss his great hugs. But video is better than nothing, and we have been able to feel there with each other."
Dachshund,fmgoqk8,t3_fv3m89,1586053893.0,"What a lovable, beautiful face!"

dachshunds,flvm44u,t3_frevas,1585526847.0,Adorable! And I can tell from the chewy.com box in the background they’re well taken care of.
TalkTherapy,flqv64k,t3_fqjs9v,1585406962.0,"It does get better. I’ve been with mine almost three years, and now I look forward to sessions. I made the decision up front to be open with him, and his acceptance — even embrace — of every single shitty thing I confessed really created a positive feedback loop for me. I want to be vulnerable with him because he rewards me with such affirming, loving reactions. Keep at it!"
Spravato,flm9cy7,t1_flm3ns8,1585277691.0,Yes. I’d say I’m about 75% of where I want to be. Not perfect but I don’t wake up wanting to die anymore.
MakeupAddiction,flm0f1x,t3_fpetoc,1585271699.0,Brilliant! You look amazing. I love the little pearls.
Spravato,fllzkhm,t3_fpce7c,1585271150.0,"I’ve tried about 20 meds over the years to no avail. Spravato is the first thing that has worked for me in 10 years. It was miraculous. It doesn’t work for everyone, but you owe it to yourself to give yourself every opportunity to feel better. I can never go back to the way I was."
Dachshund,flivmjx,t3_fp2r2n,1585191816.0,So much love in those beautiful little faces!
introvert,flhs0ar,t3_fot5kt,1585168408.0,I don’t see it as being an asshole. I’m just glad for once in my life my introversion has a useful purpose.
Spravato,flhruie,t3_foldbn,1585168322.0,"I don’t notice any effects the next day. Except for after the third treatment. The next morning, my depression had vanished. It felt miraculous. 

I have a high-mental-load job, too, and highly recommend Spravato."
depression,flhrhqw,t3_fooiyy,1585168134.0,"Part of me agrees and part of me thinks at least one person needs to be functional. If I was with another depressed person, I wonder if we’d drag each other down."
TalkTherapy,flgcegh,t1_flfhn5s,1585138773.0,Thank you! I replied — I hope it worked!
TalkTherapy,flfbjx3,t1_fldy66b,1585102484.0,"I had my first video session today. So awkward. How did you turn it around between the first and second sessions? My therapist was kind as always, but I had a hard time feeling our usual connection."
MakeupAddiction,flc45nd,t3_fnuoya,1585019435.0,"There’s so much to love in this look besides the fact you’re gorgeous: brows, eyeliner, highlighter, lip color ... Wow!"
TalkTherapy,flbx35g,t3_fnnh6c,1585014626.0,"You don’t have to do anything, but you may be missing out on a chance to do some meaningful work. And for me, talking about those feelings took away the shame. You may actually feel some relief."

TalkTherapy,fl8sh10,t3_fncaje,1584931192.0,They wouldn’t let you discuss it with them? But that’s great fodder for therapy. A better therapist would not put certain topics off-limits.
AskWomen,fl7rdno,t3_fn2xu2,1584907754.0,I love Wallflowers by Bath & Body Works. They plug in and have replaceable bulbs containing the scent. They last about a month and come in tons of scents.

AskWomen,fksx5ul,t3_fk2ply,1584500501.0,I had endometriosis before surgery fixed it. I have also given birth twice. There is no comparison. Giving birth is the only time in my life I have involuntarily screamed. The pain was otherworldly.
Spravato,fksv9a9,t3_fkas4s,1584499202.0,I’ve noticed the second of the two sprays in a dispenser is consistently weaker. The nurse theorized that the first dose intentionally delivers a greater amount.

TalkTherapy,fjok81n,t3_fedy5v,1583529420.0,"I think you know you should talk about the hard stuff with your T, but the question is how. I was in a situation with mine where I wanted to raise a difficult topic. I told him I had something hard to talk about, and instead of jumping right in to the topic itself, he had us talk about my fear of talking about it. That was an important intermediary step that never would have occurred to me. So don’t think you have to plunge right in. Explore the fear itself first. We did some great work there. The hard topic almost seemed anticlimactic after that. 

Don’t feel self-conscious about raising subjects you think should have been brought up earlier. Therapists know the work isn’t linear."
TalkTherapy,fjix5dk,t3_fdkq0v,1583377790.0,"My therapist is always so accepting about my attachment to him, and it’s not weird afterward. I usually start each session with some observations about our last session after having time to think about it. It’s a good chance to check in with each other. Makes him a better therapist and me a better client. Improves our relationship. But it’s never weird. Talking about the attachment brings us closer."
AmItheAsshole,fj7satp,t1_fj62rhj,1583097208.0,I think zero comments are appropriate even if it is an unhealthy body. None of their business.
