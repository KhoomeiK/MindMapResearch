I lived with her until the day she died. she was a book lover and passed down her passion for reading to her children and grandchildren. she would buy me pyjamas every Christmas eve, save some presents for Christmas day evening, and then more for boxing day. she made celebrations so much more special because she gave them her all. she was there for me when I was bullied in primary school, when I was abused in secondary school, when my best friend moved in for a few weeks during college. she would drive me home and back to uni twice a week because I missed home. and she missed me. we would go to the cinema together, just the two of us. we would do our make up together for new year's eve parties. she would dye and style my hair. she made bunting for my wedding decor. she drove all of the decor and wedding cake to the venue. she came with me to choose my wedding dress and all of the other wedding appointments. she came on my hen party. she walked me down the aisle. she stayed out dancing at our wedding until 1am, when there were only 4 of us left. she drove me and my wife to a hotel where we spent a few nights after our wedding, and she picked us up again afterwards. the day she died she went to the shop with me. we bought cookie mix. she picked up her prescription glasses. she bought a birthday card for my sister. she offered to run me a bath when we got home, but I said my wife would do it. she text me saying she was going to my gran's for a bit and asked how my bath was. she stayed up for when I got out of the bath to ask how it was again. that was the last time I saw her alive. she was caring until the very end."
