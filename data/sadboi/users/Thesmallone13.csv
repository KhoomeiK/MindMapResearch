I do have some questions if you're able to answer them, though! Feel free to not to in case they're against protocol or something! I won't judge! 
So, should we be scared? I am personally, and I have been slowly stocking up on supplies for a while now should SHTF. I keep hearing people say that it's nothing, everyone is over reacting, this is stupid, nothing's going to happen, people are getting better, etc. I also hear on the news that it's really bad (but I do know that the news hypes stuff up) and the same on here. Personally, I trust this and the Corona virus thread more than the news. So from a physicians perspective, should we all be really afraid? I'm not saying I'm one of those people who think this is ""stupid and the flu kills more people, etc."" because frankly, I'm freaking the hell out and have quarentined myself due to a sore throat. 
My other question is: So I said I've been prepping for this for a while and I have quite a bit of medical and first aid supplies such as individually wrapped and sterilized gauze, hypodermic needles, Band-Aids, sutures, ointments like burn cream, Neosporin, and everything in between. Everything has an expiration date on it although none of the packages have been punctured not are they yellowing or showing signs of age.
