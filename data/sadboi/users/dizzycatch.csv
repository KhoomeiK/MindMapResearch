My rapist and I were also friends and are in the same student organization. 

Getting photos of the cuts and bruises is #1. Packing up the clothes worn during the instance is #2. #3 would be going to therapy, a support group, etc. RAINN is a good resource, and so is Women Helping Women. They offer support and give you options on what to do next. 

Any stand of evidence you find, keep it. I have evidence that he wanted to do this to me before it happened (I wasn’t aware, found out through someone else). Anything you can find, KEEP IT. 

Last, this one is for you. Be a supportive friend. Listen to your friend, tell them that they are loved and that this isn’t their fault. Hold them as they cry and try your best to pick them up when they’re feeling low. My best friend didn’t believe I was raped and told me I was cheating on my boyfriend. She made fun of me and went out of her way to make my life a hell. Told me it wasn’t her job to be there for me. Just.... be a good person and be patient with your friend.

If you had an issue with the professor not returning grades, you should’ve gone to the department head and had a discussion with them. Every professor I have ever had has said, “if you have an issue, address it before final grades are posted.” Professors grade things based on different metrics. If you had questions about how things would be graded, you also should have discussed that with your professor before turning it in. 

As for the extra credit, it never hurts to do it. Theoretically, if you bombed the final, that extra credit could save you. 

Overall, you got an A-. I know someone who got one A- during her time in college and graduated with a 3.985. It’s not the end of the world. In a few years, no one will care if you got a 3.985 or a 4.0."

It's really tough to make that phone call. Maybe offer making it with her? You could talk or she could -- your call, but if it's you, say it's on behalf of your girlfriend and she is there too. Offer to go to the appointments with her. Do your own research so you are informed and you can act as another resource and someone more than emotional support (although the emotional support part is very important!!). I know it's difficult, especially now that the depression is impacting you and your well-being, but what helped me a lot was knowing that my boyfriend could do the ""difficult"" things for me, like making the phone calls. Worst case, you might have to offer an ultimatum: seek help from a doctor and try medication or end the relationship. You obviously love her a lot and I hope it won't have to reach this point, but I am 99% sure that if you offer it, she will do everything in her power to seek help. Again, I really hope that you won't have to make the ultimatum. It sucks on both ends.

Your life and mental health are important.  Please remember that. First and foremost, you need to make sure that YOU are okay. You won't be of any help to her if you can't help yourself. Good luck, and PM me if you want to talk to someone in your girl's position."
