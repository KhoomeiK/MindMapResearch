But when you test thousands of people. And not just random people. In my province, these are high risk people being tested. Couple of my friends had fevers and they weren't allowed to get tested, just told to stay at home. 

So in Saskatchewan, with just over 41 000 tests with priority to severe symptoms, confirmed case tracking, and frontline workers, only 592 tested positive.

What I'm strongly implying is that when 41 000 of the provinces highest risk people are tested and only 592 are positive, the asymptomatic rate can't be incredibly high, or the virus dies extremely fast in asymptomatic people."

But if some phone company comes, builds a bunch of towers and outright beats SaskTel in every single facet of their business, I would not pay SaskTel to have an inferior product.

Basically what I'm saying is that this is a free market, and I'll pay for the best product according to my needs. If Amazon can offer 1 day shipping cheaper than CP can offer multiple day shipping, I would have no reason to support them.
