A lot of things that feel like they're out of my control have been happening lately and I'm so overwhelmed. This is how I felt the first time I visited the Cliffs and the magic of nature made some of the shitty feelings just melt away.

He uses this against my parents to make them feel bad for him so they won't kick him out of the house (which he deserves 10 times over). He always tries to drag me down with him and will go out of his way to threaten me with telling my parents something about me they wouldn't be happy with. It's ridiculous and disgusting behavior which is why I do not speak to him any more. He's basically dead to me. I know that's harsh to say about your brother. But after dealing with this shit for 15+ years I think it's only best for my own mental health to just ignore his existence."

It's important to remember you aren't alone. Not to say that you're not important, I'm just saying that you don't need to feel like there's anything wrong with you because you feel this way. Take comfort in knowing you're not alone. Also take comfort that there so SO many people that felt this way 5, 6, 7 years ago and they're glad today that they stuck around. It's hard waiting for that moment you finally realizes why you were put on this earth. But maybe you just need some help getting there.

SuicideWatch,fnmf48v,t3_g2jkre,1587070295.0,I'm so sorry you're feeling so defeated and helpless. But its ok to not have seen anything beautiful in a year. These things take time to happen. If we had beautiful things happening to us all the time then those things wouldn't actually hold that much beauty. If that makes any sense. This virus lockdown is really tough and I'm sure makes things a lot worse for you but not being able to leave and go pick up is a huge blessing and you should use it to your advantage. Is there any mental health phone hotlines in your area that you can call until you can get to see a professional? Do some research and maybe you can find one. I wish you the best of luck üåº

Also, my EI claim ran out well before December because I was off for so long before surgery due to complications.
