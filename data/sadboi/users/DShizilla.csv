chemistry,f8slhdq,t3_e1oacj,1574783588.0,"I should probably start with a disclaimer that I don't know your whole situation and only have what you wrote to go by, but honestly it sounds like you're doing really well, especially for being in the job for a relitively sorry amount of time while finishing school. When they hired you they knew your situation and experience and likely figured you'd need time to come up to speed.  We just hired someone at my company and we're expecting a 1-1.5 year learning curve. It's part of the game.

Another thing to keep in mind is that R&D is a different game than hospital lab testing. There's a lot more uncertainty and, honestly, about 90 percent of stuff you try will fail. It's nothing you're doing wrong, it's just the nature of the beast (and a huge imposter syndrome trigger...).  Keep focused on your accomplishments, getting a Patent out and setting up an instrument is major.

In terms of learning, I'd second the ACS recommendation. They offer all sorts of free and paid classes on a variety of topics. Plus the conferences (if your boss will send you) are great places to learn and make contacts.  Also there are a ton of resources out there online. One of the biggest secrets about R&D is that the most important skill is knowing how to look something up. An hour in the library can save months in lab.  

If you like the job and your coworkers, I'd encourage you to stick with it!  Especially if they're willing to help you get the training you need.  Good luck!"
