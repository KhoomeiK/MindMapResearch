But death, and life, are both blessings, death is not the opposite of life, death is part of life, an life is amazing, death is amazing, sad when someone close to you dies, but just know that everyone will die, and it’s just part of life, nothing we can do but just accept that and get on with our lives, and if getting on with your life means dying, then get on with it. Just don’t be scared of death, is what I’m trying to say, know that it is something that will happen, but not something to be feared, but something to be embraced."

It’s awful, and you will never understand how easy it is to get addicted and how hard it is to go clean unless you do it.

Drugs,f9y71uj,t1_f9y5kue,1575724463.0,"I’m being dead serious, I’m depressed and im not sad all the time, although I do get sad. Im just bored, no matter what I’m doing, and drugs help with that in the short term, but in the long term, they really fuck with you. My advice, slow down with the drugs, I’m not saying stop, just slow down. And yea losing friend and breaking up with someone after 4 years is a good way to become depressed. For example, I normally made friends very easily, but I just recently moved and never made friends, and it really dragged me down, until I was full blown depressed. Now nothing is exciting and I am always bored. The most important thing to do is tell your doctor, or if she is really that bad, try to get hold of a different doctor. And another piece of advice, stay away from hard drugs, I’m not sure what your doing now, but you mentioned cocaine, the country I live in that is a class a drug, which is the same category as heroin and meth. All those three are not going to do you any favours dealing with depression, if you find your drug of choice, which will most likely be meth, cocaine or heroin, you will be hooked after the first time, especially while dealing with depression, so just don’t go there. Some more advice, stay away from any mdma related drugs, like ecstasy, molly and that stuff. It uses all your serotonin in a few hours, leaving you down for like a month, and paired with depression, that is not something you want."
Drugs,f9xdytl,t3_e73sdg,1575709695.0,"Bruh this sounds like depression, nothing is exciting and you don’t want to do anything, but drugs make you feel things again, people often think depression is sadness, which is absolutely not the case, depression is more of a lack of emotion, mostly the good ones, but also the bad ones. I know this from experience, you are describing depression, all I want to do is get my hands on any drug because I want to forget how chronically bored I am, alcohol, weed, ecstasy, hell, even codeine. Trust me, your not just bored, your depressed."
