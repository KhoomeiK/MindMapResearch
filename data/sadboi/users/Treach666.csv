I just try to explain that I have depression and bad  social anxiety, agoraphobia and she then proceeds to say when talking about it  ""you called it depression"" bitch I thought you are the professional and this is the term used. I expect you to explain it to me and make me understand, not just tell me to go outside and that I should get back to school when I can't even leave the house without having a panic attack and recently almost having panic attacks daily. She just pumped me full of pills the first time I went there and kept rising the dosage every time I said they don't work until I got fed up and said I won't take them anymore because they just don't work and make me feel even worse. Without them I at least felt something be it depressing bit at least I could fap and enjoy at least tiny bit of something not just be on autopilot and be a zombie. Also tried ask for benefits since I can't work but go rejected and the person handling my case just said ""I see nothing requiring a benefit"" Guess wanting to kill yourself every day, unable to leave the house without panic attacks and having mental breakdowns because of work is not enough to get it. The minute my parents will have to pay for my insurance I'm killing myself, so far I have sick note from my main doctor but that will run out in October and then my parents will have to pay for it and I'm enough of a burden as is by eating, showering and using up electricity that costs a fortune just me being alive. I don't know what to do and that is the only option because I refuse to have constant panic attacks which would lead me to suicide anyway."
