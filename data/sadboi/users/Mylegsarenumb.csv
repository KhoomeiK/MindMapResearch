BPD,fg4p0km,t1_fg4o696,1580507922.0,"Sorry for so many comments. Also, the EEOC just put a Enforcement Guidance on ADA. This means that you can tell your employer as little as the following: ""I have a mental condition that requires more frequent breaks to do my work."", ""I need some time off or a leave of absence because I am stressed and depressed."", or ""I take medication for my disorder that makes it hard to get up in the mornings."" Be mindful that they can ask you for documentation. When that happens, you need to set a meeting up with your HR rep and manager. Then provide your paper work and discuss how you feel as though your needs are being challenged and not being met in accordance with ADA and EEOC. I tore down my toxic boss and had HR all over him because of it. They retrained all of management on dealing with mental disabilities and they provided accommodations for me."
BPD,fg4o696,t1_fg4njbg,1580507401.0,"The ADA act of 1990 covers physical and MENTAL impairment. What is covered under mental disability you may ask. The following:
Depression 
Anxiety 
MOOD DISORDERS
Schizophrenia 

If you have written documentation from a doctor showing that you have one of those, they can not do shit when it comes to you expressing trouble with one of those. If they try, the ADA will take them down."

DeadBedrooms,fg4b02z,t1_fg4993z,1580499922.0,"I had a gym membership as well but I never used it due to embarrassment. Besides that, talking to someone is what helped me. I found I had depression and began to tackle that. The weight loss was a cool bonus, but taking care of my mental health was the main goal. I feel like my old self can relate to your wife. I still filled my sexual needs but everything else was just me drifting through. I seemed happy but I was not. I didn't wear my cute clothes, stopped wearing makeup, and claimed that I felt ""beautiful as I was"" when in reality, I was struggling to find myself and to truly be happy."
DeadBedrooms,fg48093,t1_fg41ma5,1580498090.0,"Maybe depression too. My therapist helped me to lose my weight by tackling my depression and giving me a list of things to fight against it. Some being a whole grain diet with a serving of fruits and vegetables every meal (the normal 3 meals a day), lots of water, and exercise at least 30 mins. I play on my phone while on the elliptical. Sounds dangerous but I figured why not play on my phone and do something that I really don't have to think about. Also, it helps to get a treadmill or something simple inside the home. I was super ashamed of myself, but in the comfort of my home, I could work out and just do whatever. I went from 182 to 140. Because of my depression, I would do the same thing as your wife. Exercise a few days, then give up because I was putting so much effort into it, but not seeing results. I am impatient and I was sad. Then I did something I didn't have to put too much effort in. Just kinda did it. I didn't even realize how much I had lost until I finally started to go out."

However, me being a person and understanding that companionship is important, knows that there are risk. You can love more than one person. I have been in three way relationships and had nothing but good and love come from them. I am not very jealous because I know I can't fit every nook and cranny for him. The pieces that I do fit, are wonderful. The same goes for him. If he wants to have sex with someone other than me most of the time but me once a month, it's okay. That person provides that piece of the relationship just like my person would provide that piece. We love each other like crazy and have our own laughs together. That is us. Just like me and someone would be our own us. And him and someone would be their own. What we have is unique to me and him. I wouldn't trade it for anything and I want him to know that I accept him as my partner. I am very sorry that stuff happened to you. I do believe that it can work, though."
