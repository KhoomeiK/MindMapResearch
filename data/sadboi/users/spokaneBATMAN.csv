depression,f31ug73,t3_df41d4,1570585074.0,"Also 24, living with parents. I used to work full time but I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. I now work 32 hours a week now which to me is still torturous and overbearing. I lie about going to school to my job when I havenâ€™t gone in over two years.

What you said about the warmth of your room and your computer I totally relate. My room is my safe place. My music, Xbox, TV shows, and movies make me feel safe and content. 

I know thereâ€™s more to life and Iâ€™m trying to get better but man itâ€™s fucking hard. Seeing posts like yours makes me feel not so lonely. Hope it gets better."

Iâ€™m gonna delete it donâ€™t wanna spread fake 1975 quotes out there. Just related with it and felt connected thinking it was Matty. Iâ€™ll make sure to have a strong source next time. My bad :("

depression,f0f8jt1,t3_d4exjo,1568579574.0,"Yes, it sucks because at the time I had no understanding of depression/anxiety. Figured I was just shy and being sad for whatever reason. For this I feel like I never applied myself like I could have. I still had some really great times but if I could do it over I would."
