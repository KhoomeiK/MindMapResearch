AskMen,epo5meb,t3_bv86pq,1559338785.0,I’m a very tall female (6’1) so I bring up the fact I’m tall in a jokey way in my bio so that people have a natural way to ask me about it in conversation and not have any “nasty” surprises. I wonder if you could do the same?

femalehairadvice,epahwv2,t3_bts3uz,1559128280.0,Ketchup is along the right lines as you need red tones to cancel the green out. You could try a small amount of shampoo designed for red heads as some of these contain small amounts of red pigment
femalehairadvice,epahbwb,t3_bu8lzu,1559128006.0,What is the end result you’re hoping to achieve? And what products did you use for each stage so far? Box dye? Permanent/ semi? Toner?
femalehairadvice,epah6ua,t3_bu8wg2,1559127939.0,"If you don’t bleach prior to dyeing green/blue your going to end up with a dirty green colour as it will be a mix of light brown (your natural hair) and green. And yes, it may stain your hair slightly. You may be able to counter that with ketchup or a red-based toner though. Sorry it’s probably not quite what you want to hear but good luck!"
