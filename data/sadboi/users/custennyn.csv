GetMotivated,f3p2a49,t1_f3aqzbs,1571039400.0,One of my ex and my current gf made the first move on me. My ex and I did not work out. I'm thinking about marrying my current girl.
depression,f2ytggv,t1_f2ybmlo,1570498043.0,"I understand. I had the same concern before I moved out. This may not be the same for you but what I did was I spent months planning. I found a job and I rented a small room. I slowly moved my stuff within a few days. When I finally walked away, I was just clutching a small bag. My family was just there, watching TV. They did not know I wasn't coming back in a long time. It was worth it. I slowly gained self-respect because most of my peers were still living with their parents while I am independent."

depression,f0n8yb0,t1_f0ldgr0,1568763725.0,I respect your views mate. I guess I'm just a bit optimistic.
depression,f0l8g0m,t3_d5d8dt,1568703656.0,"I believe in reincarnation too. I also believe that by obtaining wisdom (not knowledge) I can have a better next life. Funny how I think life is like pokemon evolutions. You get to evolve if you meet certain criteria in your current life. Perhaps a stuck mindset, or recurring tendencies that I need to overcome so that next life I can be wiser."
depression,f0kvhg9,t3_d509d2,1568689203.0,"Yes, how I wish we could live like that. We were meant to survive and thrive. Instead, we are ungrateful and greedy."
depression,f02obhc,t1_f01qihw,1568334817.0,"I like how the way you turned around your life like that. I too thought life was meaningless. What's the point, right? Some even say that our lives are part of a simulation. To me, knowing more means I having more reasons to be miserable. I guess what turned my life around was a series of events that allowed me to find my own subjective meaning in life."
