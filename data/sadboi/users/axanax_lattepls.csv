It reminds me of being in a club and brushing past someone smoking and they accidentally get ash on my leg or down my top. Not bad. I’ve had cigars and cigarettes put out completely on my legs and I loved it. It’s a good kind of pain, but it’s not a throbbing pain like being cut it’s just a raw pain for me, or that’s how my body feels. I prefer to engage in this on my lower body but I was service bottoming for a sadist before and he would put his cigars out on my butt, chest, back etc and that was super intense and a turn on for me. Especially on my bum. I don’t like getting ash in my mouth but truthfully I feel neutral about it maybe because I used to smoke cigarettes but meh, not my favorite but I can and will tolerate it. The tongue is way more sensitive so I didn’t really like having cigarettes or cigars put out on my tongue but again, I’ve done it and it feels like burning your mouth with food that’s too hot, just very centralized. I’m a masochist so 90% of the time I’m just like “fuck yes pain” but when I’m not really keen on doing it and the excitement isn’t there I’m just in a mental space of I have to suffer for you. I want to suffer for you. I love to suffer for you."

You don’t have to force yourself down violently or force yourself at all. I do because I like it or I ask for it but I like to swallow dick down. It sounds weird and I likely won’t explain it properly (it’s easier for me to demonstrate lol). Basically I’m like you and don’t have a gag reflex really (I force myself to gag and choke) but if I need a less forceful/intense throat fucking then my Dominant makes me stick my tongue all the way out and he either fucks my throat that way or when I’m on my knees doing it (more control for me) I just swallow over and over again and I feel as though that helps his dick to go down my throat more?

BDSMAdvice,fnn2h0x,t3_g2qprv,1587082998.0,"I can only speak for myself from my experiences but I consider myself to be fairly obedient and definitely so when I was in an M/s dynamic as compared to a D/s dynamic (higher protocols and training in my case), but I was caught slipping. I got pushed. Little things building up more and more. Everyone has a breaking point. Some days one is going to be tired, stressed, more vulnerable than usual and the reason my CNC scenes have played out well is because those holes, those vulnerabilities were exploited every single time. I couldn’t fight back because there wasn’t a way (I’m also into knife and needle play, etc), my no’s were irrelevant (duh cnc) so I was used brutally and beautifully. I’m not sure if that’s helpful at all but that’s just my two cents."
