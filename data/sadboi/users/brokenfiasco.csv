Being the origin against you will doesn't take your responsibility off.
I dont think that you should create bond with her or anything but just spend an hour with her explaining your decision and the context, it would probably help her mentally rather than being ghosted by her biological mother"

You only give 12k per year when you earned 500k, that's nothing!! Plus, this is your money and this is your dad so its normal that you help him out.
The fact that she is made at you is a big red flag, how someone can be made at someone else for helping his dad??"

You still can live in margin of society, go to the woods, take your welfare check and try to grow your own food.
You could use all your time to develop some artistic (or not) skills you could use to make some money (enough to pay for stuff you cant auto produce)
But well, conforming to society is just a question of sacrifice and most of the time if you don't fit in that conformity the sacrifice is your happiness"
