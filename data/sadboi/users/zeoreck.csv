You’re right, it’s going to feel so good once I finally beat her, and thanks to you, I feel like I can definitely beat her.

You and many others suggest going to Niflheim and procuring some better armor, that might be a good idea, perhaps the Sindri set really just isn’t enough.

Short cool down runic are a good idea, currently I just have the highest damage ones set.

I’m trying very hard to learn her tells, like everyone suggests, though I fear something like that will be beyond my mental capacity, I’ve always been a bit slow, so face paced highly coordinated tasks like that are very difficult for me, but I’ll try to memorize them. I wish she’d stop blinding me though. Lol

Even the characters I didn’t used to like too much I’ve grown to respect, like Bertolt, Floch and Yimr. Sorry for going off on such a fan boy tangent, I just really love AOT. Isayama crafted a masterpiece.

So I think for your proposed idea to work we need more robust networking infrastructure. Maybe not one central server with current tech but off loading more intense processing tasks to larger and more powerful servers, sounds kind of doable. I think most devices would still need some dec my measure of computing power but for your idea we’d have to shift the focus of development for most new phones to their wireless capabilities.
