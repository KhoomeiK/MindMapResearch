So, I discovered the medical qualities of Cannabis by accident. Basically, I was really depressed and withdrawn, but I stopped by a friends' house for a bit. She was a pothead, and alcohol wasn't numbing the pain anymore, so i was like, ""fuck it, i'm getting stoned."" I had two hits and suddenly i was like, ""Hey, let's watch a movie."" And I laughed and let go of all my pain for an evening. It was like a lightswitch for me- I was able to shut off my depression for the first time in years. Beyond that- it helps when i can't control my thoughts. Sometimes it's like my brain is just buzzing. I smoke a little weed and then I can focus on one thing at a time, or just let it all go. It's also helped me recover some memories and piece things together, and it's REALLY helped me let go and enjoy sex and not dissociate during sex (I have a lot of sexual trauma.)  


So, basically- you're going to have a learning curve, and it will take some experience to figure out what works for you but your best bets are 1- inhaled (not edible) and 2-Indica or Indica dominant strains (or also high CBD strains.) Inhaled (smoking or vaporization) gives you the best control and most immediate effects. Start with a puff or two. Wait a few minutes. See what happens. If you've never smoked weed before, you're gonna be a lightweight. Don't overdo it (and I mean that!) Once you figure out your tolerances vs your desired effects you can experiment with delivery methods or what works for you. I personally love edibles, BUT I would never want a beginner user to have that as their first experience. It's super easy to overdo it and an edible can flatten you! Inhaled weed is super easy to take smaller doses of, and the effects are almost immediate. You can definitely take small doses and you don't necessarily need to ""get high"" to get relief.  


Regarding strains: Sativa dominant strains tend to cause more paranoia and anxiety. It's 100% true for me, that's for sure. Indica strains are more sedating and calming. Hybrid strains have a little of both worlds. Assuming you're in a place with dispensaries- Talk to the folks that work there. They can be really helpful and knowledgable.  


Cheers! Good luck if you decide to try it."

When I first started a friend with a medical hookup got me three Indica dom Hybrids  (80/20) and they were good.

However, it's going to take some experimentation. Definitely lean towards indicas. Also it's worth chatting with your budtenders (if you have them) as they often know more about what strains they're selling and also hear back from customers on how stuff works.

adultsurvivors,fcw05kt,t3_ej2bn0,1578014088.0,"I definitely have an aversion to sex in mixed groups. Seeing a sex scene in a movie with other strangers around makes me feel super uncomfortable.   


I haven't been with anyone in six years and I hope at some point I can be. My body sends super mixed symbols. I have a sex drive, I try to take care of business myself and it doesn't always turn out good. Sometimes I have flashbacks and have to stop. It got better after therapy and weed also helps. I'm about 60/40 with how often i experience intrusive thoughts. I just hope i can make shit work for one day when I finally get a hookup."
ptsd,fcvzr0q,t1_fcvynh0,1578013818.0,"true and you gotta pick your battles.

I went through a phase of really shitty sleep due to drugs that fucked with REM sleep (drugs i was abusing, not prescribed) and I was constantly exhausted. There were other factors (like crippling depression and drug abuse) but a thing they've been emphasizing in therapy is that good sleep is essential. It's not possible for everyone but it's a thing to know."

This is definitely a thing, and i'm actually glad a guy has said this. That took a lot of confidence, congrats.  


Anyhow, PTSD and depression ruined my sex drive for ages. I suppose Paxil had something to do with it to. Just know that if you work on stuff in therapy, it gets better. Even if you have to tell your therapist about the lack of sex drive- I know that seems hard, and embarassing, but if you talk about it they can give you advice to help.  


I have been hiding my sexual issues for years and finally admitted that sex triggers me and it's hard for me to stay present and enjoy sex. I can't hide it anymore. I don't know how future partners will react to this but if I at least talk about it maybe i can work on it and get better."
MMJ,fbepv18,t1_fbepk2y,1576791162.0,"BP here as well \*(unsure if it is 1 or 2, i've gotten a bunch of diagnoses from different people over the last few months, it's kind of stupid.) I haven't ever had a problem with it triggering anything either way. I do tend to use more when i'm depressed and it can become a bad habit but otherwise it's not detrimental to my health (at least, not in the same way as energy drinks and caffeine- which has been a huge problem for me.)"

I played the aforementioned song on my twitch stream last night and then i was like, ""y'know what, i should play their entire album too.""  


Anyways, the album ""Appetite of Kings"" is on youtube and it's the best way you can ever spend 23 minutes. They played New England constantly (I used to see them in New Haven, CT at the Tune Inn \[rip\]). Appetite of Kings came out in 1995 or so. I'm pretty sure they've faded into oblivion, except among the folks that were there at the time."
ptsd,fbep640,t3_ecjd5h,1576790699.0,"yo- ME TOO!  


I've been holding back basically everything in group because the former group i was in contained some shady guys and also a bunch of bible thumpers. I have a history of growing up queer in an extremely toxic religion, with extremely toxic/violent people and also incest/rape and I didn't feel comfortable talking about it with everyone.  


Currently- our group is solid folks who trust each other, and the project today was ""tell us a way that your family shaped you- negative or positive."" And I was just like OH HERE WE GO, Y'ALL... I wasn't the first one to share and tbh, everyone had super fucked up stories. Still i feel like i kind of floored the room. I guess that's my superpower? Either way i feel like everyone looks at me differently now. BUT the whole point of therapy is to talk about and undo this mess, so....  


If nothing else, sharing your story can help others in their recovery. That's why I stepped up and shared today."

VetTech,fben8h8,t3_ecvhg0,1576789468.0,"Just FYI- there are literally chapters in tech books about how you WILL burn out and what other fields you can work in when that happens. The lifespan of a technician is 10 years. It's not you or your wife's fault- it's just the facts. I definitely went through it and I was also pigeonholed into my job because it was the only way i could make the money i needed to. It was a hard thing to get used to, but I had to make do with making less money. My health wasn't worth it anymore.  


A field she might be interested in is working for a reference lab. Prior to my becoming disabled, I worked for a lab. If she's mechanically inclined, it might interest her. Parasitology is also a highly sought after position (as in- Idexx is always hiring for Parasitology and will provide the training which is amazingly comprehensive.) Beyond just reading slides for bugs, there's also educator positions (every lab is supposed to have one educator in the department.) Oh and the pay is very reasonable."
