Ive unsubbed from the main sub bc i just have no interest in seeing social media posts from queens i dont follow reposted again and again. No actual discussion or speculation happens there.

Drag culture in general has been such a big part of my life and Im growing very disillusioned with it as well.

Its just sad to kind of let this go and move on. But when you have two drag cons a year and uninspired casts and everything is just a money plot at this point, its no longer interesting.
