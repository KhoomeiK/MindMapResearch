- Kept mentioning that they want people to ask them for help or to explain something, as if they said it at the start of the year and then not again I know some students felt less invited to the further through the year we went.

- If they saw someone struggling might check in with them either during class or at the end if they'd get more shy during the class.

- Smile, it seems a bit obvious but teachers smiling when they saw us in the corridor or on our way into/out of class made a big difference.

- when people got stuff wrong, some of our teachers would say something like ""that's not the answer to this but I can see why you'd think x because y"" and it felt less harsh when you'd get something wrong as the teacher would explain it more as a misunderstanding than a major error, if that makes sense.

I'm bisexual too (but female) and I'm generally more on the homosexual side in terms of romantic relationships. But due to my childhood, I go through periods of heightened emotion and recklessness where I act very similarly to you in terms of what I'm looking for and the danger I've put myself in. I also end up hurting myself if I try to avoid those behaviours. And mine is always with men though, outside of these periods, I'm only really interested in women. I think mine comes from a place where those men when I was 11+ were my only way of getting attention/approval from an older person as my parents had their own problems and I didn't really get affection from them, so later on when my attachment disorder flares up or something else flares up that makes me relive parts of my childhood, I seek out the only comfort I knew back then. And because the kind of men who would groom an 11 yr old are pretty fucking sick, I relate very rough things to that attention. 


I find as soon as soon I'm not horny (like if I masturbate and climax) I get that disgust with myself of like ""Seriously, that shit turns you on?""

It gets more dangerous as you're move closer to 250mg/kg and any overdose 12g or above is usually treated as potentially fatal (at least in the UK anyway). The stomach pain is probably either your stomach not being happy with the number of pills (have you eaten recently as maybe that's why) or psychosomatic due to your anxiety about the possible overdose. Or maybe it's just due to something completely separate like a stomach bug or something.


It's good that you checked, as many people underestimate paracetamol and if you were to take a lethal overdose and then leave it until symptoms develop (jaundice, liver pain, etc.) then it can be too late to do anything, and getting a liver transplant fast enough considering the circumstances is unlikely."

I've done a lot of work on my mental health and am psychologically minded too so I'm interested by and very aware of my symptoms and I'm lucky that I'm more able to be self reflective and rational about them than a lot of people are.
