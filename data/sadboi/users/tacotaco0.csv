adhdwomen,fpimrc7,t3_gdonm6,1588644152.0,"Recently graduated engineer here. I found throughout the course of my degree that studying late at night (11p-4a) really helped when trying to get things done since there were less distractions bc everyone else was asleep. It was agonizingly boring but it was the only way I was able to get coursework completed:)

I also found that herbal supplements such as L-thianine and ashwaganda root worked well to calm my mind. Good luck to you!"

Seems like a good way to give back and make the process of seeking help more efficient and effective."

Hamilton,ex07whz,t1_ewyl2to,1565906707.0,I asked my friend who was in the study and she said they ask about what happened when you go to you doctors office! They don’t ask personal details about your mental health
Hamilton,ewyti5j,t1_ewyl2to,1565886558.0,It's just you and the researcher (one person) so it's pretty chill. Also you get to take pictures about your experiences (like abstract stuff) if you want so it's not all talking LOL
