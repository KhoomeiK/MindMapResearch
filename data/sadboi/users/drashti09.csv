mentalhealth,fo3morp,t3_g5ir1i,1587489467.0,"Well I don't exactly relate to this but I can tell you, I have my anxiety issues as well and similar things keep happening to me. While idk what exactly can help you, there's this breathing exercise that could help a bit when you start getting anxious. So try to deep breathe in and out for 5 seconds each and repeat that for a few minutes. It will help you get settled. 
As far as dealing with the issue is  concerned, a bit of self analysing through journaling your thoughts might help you as it makes you detangle stuff in your head and try to bring you clarity and peace."
mentalhealth,fnve0ht,t3_g43t45,1587289752.0,"Yes, we're in the same boat. The situation keeps getting worse untill a burst out and hours of crying after finally understanding that it wasn't worth it at all and it's just my anxiety. Always in search of a solution for this but no luck yet. And Yes its extremely lonely."

socialskills,flnncog,t3_fpg7cg,1585322170.0,"I just keep getting this crippling anxiety whenever I have the slightest hint that I might not be wanted and I cannot help it at all. 
As  I'm typing rn I feel it and I don't like it and I don't understand what to do and I just badly want this gone.
I think I should also blame the kind of relationships I have in my life or maybe they're just Normal and I'm overthinking about all this.
I just want to cry for long and get away from all this but obviously I can't. I can't speak to my therapist with everyone around all the time as they're not aware that I am taking therapy and I'm going crazy here with all this anxiety that I just can't take.
I'm trying to keep up but guess I'm just tired and honestly just wanna disappear. I have thoughts sometimes about how easy it would be to get hit by a bus or electrocuted or something ( I am not suicidal, I just wander sometimes how that would make things light)."
