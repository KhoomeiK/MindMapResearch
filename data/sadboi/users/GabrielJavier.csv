AskReddit,erztkgb,t3_c54hh2,1561450781.0,"(As of now I'm a Catholic/Christian in the middle of being agnostic, but I still believe, though I'm not as religious as I was back then)

This was somewhere in January 2018 when I was in 11th Grade. I was using an app called Talklife (a mental health support/social app) and there was this guy who made a post about extremists of religion, so I commented somewhere along the lines of ""On behalf of Christians, I'm sorry that there are a lot of a--holes like that who use religion as an excuse to hate on lgbt and other races (particularly Trump supporters and other religious extremists) and I despise them too. They give religion a bad name.""

He commented: ""Your religion gives religion a bad name"" and proceeded to debate me and try to convince me to turn atheist. I know how this goes. No one's minds will change, because no one can be 100% sure. Obviously all we did was run in circles as I constantly point out I'm on the same side as him where I think religious extremists are crap, but he just wants me to turn atheist at that time. It took 100-200 comments of us ""talking"" or him arguing and telling me I'm stupid.

Then came me being depressed (not related to this incident but I was having suicidal thoughts back then). Made some posts on Talklife about being depressed and posts about faith, and I also made a post on the lines of ""It is not cool for believers to bash on atheists AND it is also uncool for atheists to bash on believers. It's called respect no matter what people's beliefs are. If people are promoting hope through religion, there is no need to hate on them and say things like God is not real etc etc. If people who are atheists who don't want to believe, no need to force and condemn each other. It's basic humanity.""

But he still kept on coming.

I don't want to convert him to a Christian because to me, he has strong points on why he's atheist because of the sh*tty hypocrites among religion. I just want him to see me as a friend/not an enemy. I already stated I disagree with the views of homophobic/racist/sexist extremists. But he still keeps on spamming me with negative comments and arguing. It coincided with the time when I was also depressed that the weight on my head got heavier. At the same time this was happening, I was on the bus at 5am on the way to our school retreat. I quietly cried while my other friends were asleep in the bus. The school retreat was empowering and cheered me up a bit though.

Fast forward to about one year later, I saw he was more chill and he's a cool guy now. He made a post how he went through an ""angry atheist stage"" back then, but he's still atheist and he only gets angry IF a religious person is being an a--hole/racist/homophobe. He's a nice guy, perhaps he was just infuriated with the current issues at that time (probably Trump and American far-right extremists) that he got cranky at most Christians/religious people. I've had worse encounters with actual religious people regarding political/social issues, and I know most atheists are kinder than these types of people. I still believe in God, but I distance myself from close-minded hateful people supporting corrupt politicians.

Looking at his recent posts, he's a nice guy and I wish him the best"

You might not think it right now, but people do care for you. I believe the problem is that they mostly don't say it / show it, but they do.
