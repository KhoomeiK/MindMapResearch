ptsd,ez4z68x,t1_ez4uibs,1567694283.0,"I’m just glad that my extensive knowledge of psych meds can actually help someone! Also, here’s the paper on the [ability of SSRIs to stop marijuana-associated memory-loss](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002194&type=printable). If you choose to print it off, you definitely don’t need anything after page 32, but you could also just put it on your phone/tablet/computer and show the doctor that way. Personally, I think that the combination of the two could be a really promising treatment for PTSD (pending actual research :P).

Also, since you’ve found marijuana to be helpful, you might like to know that you should watch out for mold with pot. I know that growers in Canada have a huge issue with it. While cannabis, itself, isn’t harmful, mycotoxins (toxins produced by mold) can be extremely harmful. Now, I’m not saying that the mold that grows on weed is anywhere near as bad as the black mold that can grow in your house, but I think that it’s something that you should be aware of. Some companies irradiate their marijuana to stop mold growth (and the growth of anything else, tbh). If you can, I’d recommend trying to find a company that does that because the weed will be safer in that the mold growth will have stopped after it was shipped, as opposed to having it possibly continue to grow. That said, I only know of a handful of companies that irradiate their product and they don’t like to advertise it (pothead lore says that radiation=bad), so you may have to actually call the companies to ask them.

An alternative to smoking pot that I highly recommend in terms of safety is taking oils or capsules. There was even a peppermint-flavoured sublingual (under the tongue) spray that I saw. The reason I find them preferable is because most of the harmful stuff, like mycotoxins, have been removed in the manufacturing process. Also, they use buds and parts of the plant that aren’t pretty enough to be sold to be smoked, but still contain the same THC/CBD as the parts that are sold to be smoked. This cuts down on waste in the manufacturing of marijuana, which I appreciate. Another benefit of oils is that you don’t smell like weed, which may be helpful.

Also also, in theory, if you were to take only CBD, it wouldn’t show up in a drug test. THC is what would show up. Now, in the US, companies aren’t required to provide certificates of analysis, so you’d need to find one that does. Also, CBD is 100% legal in the US. It’s THC that’s the issue. There is a risk that there is some THC marijuana/oil that you get, even if it is supposed to only contain CBD because the plant does make both compounds, naturally. That said, most drug tests have their tolerances set high specifically to account for natural variations in human biochemistry. I wouldn’t stake my job on it, but, if I was specifically taking oils with only CBD, I would challenge any positive drug test and possibly sue the manufacturer of the marijuana for damages resulting from their false advertising.

If you’d like to know more, I have quite a few friends in the *pharmaceutical* industry doing quality control, so I know a fair bit about it."
ptsd,ez4qi86,t1_ez484xm,1567690687.0,"Personally, SSRIs were great for me, at first, but, after a while, they started hurting my stomach (I tried several different ones). I ended up switching to an SNRI and had the same success without the side effects. In my experience, doctors will tend to push SSRIs more for PTSD, but SNRIs do have similar effects, there just isn’t the research explicitly stating that SNRIs help PTSD, while there is research saying that SSRIs do. (No one’s bothered studying SNRIs with PTSD, yet, as far as I’m aware.)

In terms of anxiety drugs, the biggest issue with them is that they have a significant risk of addiction. That said, if you’re careful with them, you can manage it. I was given benzodiazepines. While they’re not recommended for PTSD because of their issues associated with long-term use, I found them very helpful for dealing with the times when everything else had failed. The biggest issue with benzodiazepines and long-term use is cognitive decline (and addiction). The nice thing is that any cognitive decline that’s experienced while on them is completely reversible once you stop. Anyways, that isn’t an issue if you use them only for emergencies.

Propranolol (a beta-blocker) is a blood pressure medication that’s moderately effective as an anti-anxiety drug and isn’t known to be habit-forming, so that might also be an option for you. In my experience, it doesn’t chill you out completely, the way that most anxiety drugs do. Instead, it just takes the edge off, so it might be helpful for therapy. That said, if you’re like me and have asthma, it will likely make it worse, so you need to consider that.

You might have noticed that I don’t use specific drug names and, instead, talk about classes of drugs. That’s for two reasons: 1. Because I’m each category, there are different options for specific drugs that may be tolerated better/worse in different people, 2. Because when you go to your doctor, saying that you’d like to try a class of medications makes you sound more informed than if you go in saying that you want to try a specific medication (because drug advertising is a thing! A dumb thing, but a thing), and 3. Because I’m Canadian and I’m too lazy to try looking up American names for the different drugs. :P

If you want more information on this stuff, feel free to PM me. I’d love to help, if I can. I’m a chemist, not a doctor, but I’ve been on most of these drugs (plus some more), so I’ve gotten a pretty good understanding of them."

2. You may appreciate that SSRIs/SNRIs will actually stop the memory loss that you’d normally get with marijuana, so the combination may be helpful for you, if you’ve found that weed helps. (I can get you the paper to show a psychiatrist, if you’re interested. I’m just tired and should be sleeping, right now.)
