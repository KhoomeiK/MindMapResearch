Greyhounds,fonkwai,t3_g6w6lu,1587921447.0,"Mine has similar behaviors. He‚Äôll roach for belly rubs then suddenly growls. He does other weird stuff like growling then wanting to nibble my fingers right after or throw his paws around. Depending on the intensity of his growls we usually keep petting him and he ends up rolling back over for more rubs. The growling has gotten better the longer we‚Äôve had him so I think it‚Äôs all about building trust with him. Just be patient, learn their different signals, and respect their space. Often the growling isn‚Äôt aggression it‚Äôs just a way for them to communicate with you. For example, with mine a low growl is him telling me he doesn‚Äôt want to be pet in that place but if I switch to his belly he‚Äôll usually roach for more rubs. If he growls again then I know he wants to be left alone. 

Edit: also if I sit next to his bed without even touching him he growls sometimes and I know he wants to be left alone. For that reason he isn‚Äôt allowed on any furniture. Maybe establishing good boundaries with where your pup can lay will help?"

Basically, you‚Äôll find someone who understands and will get through it with you. One thing that helped me deal with the crazy thoughts was saying that if I still felt the same way in a week then I‚Äôd tackle the problem. During an episode I‚Äôd want to drop out of school, quit my job, dump my boyfriend, pack up and move across the country all while crying and having panic attacks. Then my period would start and I‚Äôd go back to being completely content with things. Telling myself not to act on the crazy right away saved my ass from doing some stupid stuff. Also, idk what treatments you‚Äôve tried but I got an IUD and it has, for the most part, gotten rid of the PMDD symptoms. I still get weird at times, but not to the same severity.
