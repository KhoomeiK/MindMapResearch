SuicideWatch,foey5pq,t1_foex650,1587718962.0,"Oh, I see. I understand that you’re hurting, abandonment stings a lot doesn’t it.... In life,
some relationships come and go, while others are here to stay... However if people “always” leave you after a while, I wonder what’s happening... Im not sure how old you are, but regardless of which, some people steer away from people suffering from mental health issues - because the unknown is uncomfortable for them, and the stigma and misinterpretation has got to their heads... If that’s the matter - they’re just not mature enough to see that mental health issues are not a life sentence - and it doesn’t define the whole person either. Leaving someone because of that is sad, and is such a judging attitude... Im not sure how old you are but this may happen more often to younger people as their group of friends are more likely to be immature than older people, but this can happen to all age groups too... If that’s a reason to why someone has stopped talking to you - you deserve MUCH better and MUCH more mature friends!!! However if this isn’t the case... I would love to encourage you to visualize a few social situations prior to the point they stopped talking to you - and do some self-reflecting, anything you could improve at/do any better? This is not to self-criticize but we are all growing through life - and we can always work on our self-development..."

mentalhealth,fno8c09,t3_g2y3a2,1587115914.0,"Hi sweetie, I'm so glad that you're reaching out here! Seems like you're struggling quite much these days? Oh, 13 years old and wanting life to be put to an end :( That's definitely not how it's supposed to be, love... I'm wondering what has made life so difficult? I mean, like what lies behind/or what has caused your depression and anxiety to develop?And, the loss of control there. That sounds very uncomfortable and confusing.  Sounds like you feel unable to control those strong thoughts, and that something within you ""forces"" you to act upon those thoughts no matter what, is that about right?So, I'm just wondering love, how much control do you lose, like specifically, if you range it in %? Like, do you lose 50% / 80% / 95% /100%? My point is, that our minds are complicated, advanced ""machines"", and our thinking has great power. We have a lot going on in our unconscious minds, but there's a lot going on in our conscious minds too. We can learn how to gain control over our unconscious minds by better controlling our conscious mind. That way, we understand our unconscious minds better - making some of it ""move"" from unconscious processes to conscious ones, by knowing that it's there - and why it's there... It may sound complicated, but it's really not that complicated. Let me give you an example... Someone developing social anxiety, there can be many causes to that, but let's say there have been a number of social events where that person feels laughed at, neglected, stupid, and everything that person says feels ""wrong"" no matter what. Well, in the beginning, those thoughts are quite clear in their mind, so it's quite conscious at that point. Then over time, that person gets so used to it, so an unconscious limiting belief forms, saying something like ""I'm so socially awkward, and no one ever likes me"". Then eventually, anxiety pops up from ""nowhere"" around new people for example, and then, anxiety seems hard to deal with because ""this is just how it is"". However, the truth is that someone can beat social anxiety by taking back control. Our minds have so much power, and our conscious minds can take back control over all sorts of mental processes, or at least increase control. I'm saying this to show you that we may be able to control ourselves more than we may believe... And I'm not sure what causes you to lose control in the situations you mention, but I'm quite sure that something within you can ""choose"" to gain more control. Like, ""nope, I'm still in charge""... And even if you can increase your control by 2%, to begin with, then 5%, then 10%, and then more, and more, and more... Then that's a great start! That's way better than letting your thoughts be the boss, and just giving in. Now, I'm not sure how much sense this makes? But I think this can be a starting point, perhaps? Trying to believe in your own ability to gain control - and see what happens? Oh and don't be afraid to let me know if you feel misunderstood, and let me know if you need someone to talk to anytime, I'll be here my dear."

depression_help,fn9gyss,t3_fzmf83,1586772614.0,"Hi! Awesome to hear that you want change! That’s a good start. As you’re asking for advice I’d love to share what worked for me... My depression was awful. It was a prison and a parasite and it drove me to the point of wanting to end everything... CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) enabled me to change my life. Please notice that last part; it enabled(!) me to change my life. CBT nor any other form of therapy can change your life, but it can enable you to change your life... That’s often challenging because depression makes it even more difficult to make changes, HOWEVER, it is MUCH more painful to stay the same for a long time - rather than the “briefer” period of pushing through making changes that will eventually turn out to be game changing. CBT has lots of good strategies that you can use yourself, perhaps there’s a good course out there? Or you can see a CBT-therapist? After beating my own depression I studied CBT and I’m in fact a certified CBT-therapist now working on creating and launching a CBT course to help people beat depression, but as it’s not finished yet, I’d advice you to check other courses, I’m sure there are other great ones available! :) You can do this!!! I can see that you’re really serious about making a change, and that’s really all you need to start. Look at the CBT strategies as a new skill that you need to learn. Be patient and take some time to really implement it into your life, it’s worth the time, I promise, because after that it turns automatic like any other skill for instance learning how to drive a car/ride a bicycle, so CBT too will turn into an automatic skill after a while - and then it will serve you for the rest of your life helping you to keep depression permanently (!) out of your life..! 
Just promise yourself to not give up and that you’ll do your best! I believe in you!! Well done reaching out here and asking for guidance!! :) wishing you all the best in life and in recovery!"
