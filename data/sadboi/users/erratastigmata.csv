For me, science and astronomy are what bring my existential comfort. Mental illness has existed for a long time; why would evolution do this? It's theorized that there's an evolutionary advantage to having some mentally ill individuals in the population; that they see things differently and can come up with novel ideas. The amount of famous artists, inventors, scientists, creators with mental illness lend credence to that thought. A lot of people I know who are mentally ill have above average levels of self-awareness and emotional sensitivity. 

I know that being bipolar can be horribly hard, often humiliating and outright miserable. All of us here have felt how you feel. But please don't give in to only seeing the negatives in life. I promise there's some good things. Your flaws are a part of you and NO ONE is useless. You can impact the world in your own way.

Seroquel is VERY effective if you can tolerate it, I also had success with Zyprexa and that's a bit better than the Seroquel. This is just my own personal experience and I am not a medical professional obviously, but it's worth asking about.
