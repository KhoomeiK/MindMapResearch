You asked how Zen studiers define ""I"" or ""self"". In other words, *""How would you define these concepts from a Zen perspective? What does the philosophy of Zen have to say about this that distinguishes it from or approximates it to other philosophies' takes? What is the Zen take? Can you conceptually elaborate the exclusive opinion on this matter that cuts to the essence of what Zen is?""*

But the problem is... you can't. As soon as somebody takes it upon themself to elaborate ""the Zen perspective"", they've already lost it. If it were a Zen Master speaking to another Zen Master, they could do just this and understand each other's meaning perfectly well. But in trying to explain Zen to people unfamiliar with it, you only end up leading them away from Zen by creating a conceptual prison which limits their thinking, because they get attached to what they think ""Zen"" to be when it is nothing at all (even this is misconstrued). You can't define the self from a Zen perspective. Not because it's simply indefinable, we should never try to define it and *that's* what Zen is getting at - no. You just can't define it without missing the mark. But supposing that this has already been posted, I will provide the most popular example of Zen and self-ness that pops to mind:

That doesn't make me an authority on meditation and what it is as that can vary from person to person, but I think it clearly shows that I'm not adverse to seated meditation and am not trying to discredit it or its benefits. I'm just adverse to its glorification (and the subsequent attachment to it as a practice) and the misconstrued link between it and Zen. 

As other commenters have pointed out, the words we often translate as ""meditation"" are actually very vague and don't exactly fit the seated practice we might designate by the term in English. There have been many different texts from many different geographical regions and traditions translated into English, and ""meditation"" in one context might not mean the same thing in another context - it depends on interpretation and how people go about it. Worse yet, here we are trying to get at these terms in English while trying to keep things as simple as possible. A lot of heated discussion here has essentially just been a matter of semantics across a linguistic and cultural barrier, as I take it that very few people here both 1) speak Middle Chinese, and 2) were alive as Zen monks at the time that the texts we often refer to here were being written and therefore fully understand the sociolinguistic use and cultural context of certain terms and practices at that given time. But one thing comes across clearly in reading Huineng, Matsu, Foyan and many others: sitting meditation is not ""the way"". 

It's an activity like any other and is just as much ""the way"" as anything else, but should not be relied on as ""the way"" to enlightenment like so many people make it out to be. You could reach insight just peeling potatoes for thirty years straight, just like you could reach it by sitting and meditating. So why sit and meditate trying to reach some state or force something to happen? You don't have to. Just be natural. If you wanna meditate, go and meditate. But don't count on it to be *the* miracle cure."

Actually, seeing as this seems like an appropriate time to discuss it, what do you make of the claim that Zen is an integral part of Japanese culture? As in, how it's allegedly an integral influence and component of so much of what we consider to be ""Japanese"" like the tea ceremony, martial arts, painting and so forth? 

A lot of it has to do with mindfulness and momentism so I would take it that Dogen's influence is what's being referred to, but those things were already being correlated with ""Zen"" well before Dogen. In Tang-dynasty China, certain art forms like poetry, calligraphy and painting are thought to have been greatly influenced by Chan and that's a trend that followed into Japan later. Wang Wei (699-759) is an example of how art and Chan mixed in Chinese history. There's the whole concept of not really thinking about it and writing Chinese characters in a flash, being fully in the moment. The same would be done with a painting or a poem. ""Just do it"", basically. The work of art becomes an incarnation of that very moment that it was made in, and as it was not thought about, it was done with your true nature instead of your conceptual mind. That's an element found more in traditional Japanese art, but the tea ceremony and martial arts tend to place more focus on concentration, which is more reminiscent of Dogen and meditation."

>Bankei didn't ""do away with anything"".


From Peter Haskel's ""*Bankei Zen*"" :


>In 1659, in recognition of
his new status, Bankei received advanced rank in the
Myoshinji. Still something of the enfant terrible, he reportedly elicited objections from traditionalists for refusing to observe the conventions of the ceremony, which included the taking up of koans.

>For Bankei no special practices included koan practice, which had for a long time enjoyed enormous popularity in Japanese Zen. For Bankei koan study with its emphasis on arcane foreign-language material was, in fact, a serious impediment to practitioners of merely average intellectual ability and threatened to drain much of the spontaneity from the encounter between master and student. For Bankei the whole approach of koan Zen was hopelessly contrived.
>
>The original koans, Bankei pointed out, were actual living events. It is precisely the spontaneity of these interchanges between teacher and student that represents the Unborn, not the content. Why ossify the content of these experiences into words of the ancients to be studied when you can look at your own ""cases""—that is, the way in which the Unborn is at work here and now in the actual circumstances of one's life. Why rely on a device, he argued, when you could have the thing itself?


Conclusion: Fairs.


___________________

> Bankei's approach wasn't any different than any other Zen Master's. 

Again, same book:

>In this sense, Bankei was a traditionalist. He harked
back to the Zen masters of the ""golden age"" before the triumph of the koan, masters like Lin-chi I-hsuan (J: Rinzai Gigen, d. 860), founder of the Rinzai school. Bankei insisted that his own teachings were the same as Lin-chi's, and the many similarities between the Sermons and the Lin-chi lu (J: Rinzai roku), the record of Lin-chi's teachings, suggest that the Chinese master may have been an important influence on Bankei's Zen.
>
>Taken as a whole, however, Bankei's teaching remains uniquely his own. Ironically, its failure to survive was probably due to the very qualities that made it so distinctive and so attractive to Bankei's students: its close identification with Bankei's own personality and its refusal to associate itself with particular procedures or techniques.  


Conclusion: Yeah, fairs."

Your words, not mine. I was discussing the cultural rift between middle class people and working class people, which is more expansive than what you're talking about. It can range from how they speak to the music they listen to. 

You will notice that a lot of the American working class in the South (a very working class region) will maintain a certain degree of pride vis à vis the Confederacy and will in fact be Christian, but that's not to say that all working class people are despite a lot of them being so. *""A true Scotsman...""* As such, we have to recognise that there is a cultural rift already between middle class leftists and working class leftists, and an even bigger one yet between middle class leftists and the working class as a whole, which includes many people who are closer to the depiction in the comic depending on geographical, historical and socio-cultural context. You won't get that in the ""working class"" I know in my own cultural context because I'm not American. But regardless, these are still members of the working class that leftism aims to aid and we've seen that working class voting behaviour does in fact sometimes follow populist rhetoric which adheres more to conservative values than progressive ones. Where I come from, the correlation between being working class and voting for leftist policies has pretty much disintegrated. People instead are veering closer to the right."
zen,fouqzlr,t3_g9epc7,1588088949.0,"And here we are again squabbling about meditation and it's uses. 

Meditation began as a form of magical ritual where it was thought that practitioners would reach higher levels of consciousness and perhaps contact divine entities and obtain supernatural powers (*siddhis*) if practiced frequently enough. Its use in non-secular Buddhist traditions is often still associated with some form of magical ritualism and its use in secular settings is often criticised for being a Trojan horse or sorts into troublesome metaphysical ideas for practitioners unfamiliar with Buddhist philosophy and feeding practitioners' sense of ego, contrary to the original practices' intentions.

Does that mean that meditation is bad in itself and shouldn't be practised? No, various meditations have been associated with positive cognitive and affective benefits, and meditation can be practised to these ends. As for Chan/Zen, the essence of Chan is not meditation. One can induce a state of mind where it is perhaps easier to entertain ideas of non-duality and such when in a state of meditation, but that doesn't mean meditation is the heart of Chan practice. It's just a tool to a certain end, a ritual practice that can induce certain states of mind. ""Magic"".

zen,fouo5h3,t3_g9jxpr,1588087571.0,"The ""oneness"" of everything in Buddhism (watch as I get harpooned for equating Zen with Buddhism) comes from the concept of ""dependent origination"", which states that everything in the universe is conditioned by other factors, meaning that nothing has any independent essence. The conditions that go into making a tree for example are a seed, soil, sunlight, water and so forth, and without the conjunction of all of these factors in the right conditions, the phenomenon we know as ""tree"" would not arise. Nothing about the tree is independently existent - it is by its own nature dependent on its environment and is not independent from it. And seeing as everything is conditioned by its environment, nothing is permanent either as this conditioning is ongoing. The tree will one day be cut down to make a newspaper, which then will be discarded and used to make a papier mâché sculpture - or perhaps it might die and give its nutrients to the soil which will then feed other trees, making that tree part of those other trees. This is summed up in the first and third marks of existence, impermanence and ""non-self"". This applies to humans and to the ""self"" too. Our sense of self is thought to come from the conjunction of five aggregates, namely our consciousness, physical form, emotions, conceptual thoughts and desires. The impression we have of being an independently existing ""self"" is illusory. Therefore we have a relative reality as we see and understand it with terms and concepts that point to independently existing phenomena and then we have the ultimate reality beneath those concepts that is the nature of things as they really are beyond these concepts.

All this stuff above is Buddhism 101 and can be found in the older Theravada (India, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia) and ""newer"" Mahayana (East Asia) and Vajrayana (Tibet, Japan) forms of Buddhism. However, in Mahayana Buddhism, they took the notion of the ultimate reality further and explained that this is the ultimate realm that the Buddhas accessed and is itself the source of Buddhahood. There are three realms then, the word of emanations that we see on the physical level (nirmanakaya), the subtle world of spiritual bliss and the joys associated with awakening to the dharma (sambhogakaya) and the ultimate reality (dharmakaya) which all exist as one, but we are mostly only conscious of the world of emanations at any time. Everything emanates out of the dharmakaya, and this is the ""One Mind"" that Huangbo alludes to throughout the text you're reading. Chan (Zen) is derived from Mahayana Buddhism but distinguishes itself by the fact that it eschewed all notion of relying on established doctrine and ritual, forgoing the dependence on texts (although ironically going on to put a lot of importance on certain texts such as the Lankavatara Sutra, the Prajnaparamita Sutra and later the notion of koans as a cornerstone of its philosophical elocution), magical rituals (including meditation) and even Buddhist ethics and philosophy, which are still a dependency if they are seen as being needed in order to attain enlightenment. Instead, the point of Chan is to dismiss all contrived, unnecessary, confounding conceptual or ritual elaboration and to cut straight to the source of the Buddhist teachings - the nature of self and of mind as seen vis à vis the dharmakaya. So what I've just elaborated here isn't really a Zen explanation, it's more of a Buddhist explanation. Zen Masters would more likely point you towards your self-nature by more varied, non-conceptual means, as you can see by reading about how most Zen Masters acted - especially the lineage of but can be seen as a ""skillful means"" (upaya) of pointing towards what Zen is talking about, as long as you then get rid of the conceptual elaboration once you've gotten the point, because even the means that brought you to realisation are an obstacle. The allegory of a raft is often used in Buddhism. You use the raft to get to the other side of the river but once you're there. You don't need the raft anymore. Or as the Daoist master Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tzu) once said:

> The purpose of a fish trap is to catch fish, and when the fish are caught the trap is forgotten. 

For example, in everything I just said, an important notion in the realisation of the dharmakaya - and therefore your true nature - is the notion of non-duality - ""not-twoness"". If you were to take the notion of non-self too literally, you would go on to exclude all notion of self that can exist, which is not the Middle Way, going beyond the polarising nature of thoughts and concepts and realising that self and non-self are both illusory, transcending them both. Your true nature transcends all dualistic apprehensions. Life and death, self and non-self, good and bad, etc. If you take ""Everything is one"" too literally, you will only create a duality between ""oneness"" and ""not-oneness"", meaning that you haven't understood the ultimate realisation of your true-nature, which goes beyond even this duality. A Zen Master exists as an independent self and as the absolute beyond the illusion of self both at once. The Vimalakirti Sutra says:

> To enter non-duality means to see that ""I"" and ""not-I"" are not two. 

Or to use an example given by Zen Master Yunmen to a student too attached to the notion of oneness:

> Master Yunmen asked a monk, ""An old man said, 'In the realm of nondualism there is not the slightest obstacle between self and other.' What about Japan and Korea in this context?"" 
>
>The monk said, ""They are not different."" 
>
>The Master remarked, ""You go to hell.""


So there you have it. Everything is one and our sense of independently existing phenomena is just an illusion - a trick of the mind... but also not an accidental trick of the mind either. If you want more information, I have a blog post on the nature of mind here which goes into a bit more detail:

Yes, in their double-consonant form, but otherwise you'll notice cases such as the particle ""reul"" which although being written 를 actually has a distinct ""r"" and ""l"" sound despite being written with the same character. This is because that character has two possible readings depending on where in a morpheme it is, making it either one until context is given. The way that ""r"" in Korean is pronounced is actually rather close in some ways to the way that ""l"" is pronounced in English, making them rather easy to slip into like how ""d"" and ""t"" and ""g"" and ""k"" are very similarly pronounced, with one being voiced and the other un-voiced."

Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, Zhaozhou is still Zhaozhou - it doesn't matter who wrote the foreword. But for the record, the passage I actually really liked is worth sharing in my opinion, so here it is:

&#x200B;

>What is the origin of suffering? Although it has been taught many times and in many different ways, clinging to our deluded stories of who and what we are is the origin of our suffering. Clinging to the idea that we are really separate from each other is our deluded story of the self. Therefore, if we want to work most effectively for the welfare of all beings, we must forget all about our own stories. If we wish to understand Buddha's liberating teaching, we must completely let go of our own narrative about reality.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>What is this story that many of us tell ourselves and hold on to almost all the time? It goes something like this—I'm here and you are over there, my life is separate from yours, the objects of my awareness are external to me. This story is almost instinctive. Once it arises, it is almost impossible not to grasp it as real. Attaching to it as real is the origin of our suffering. With this story we are well equipped with anxiety but not necessarily well equipped to face it, so we embark on a career of trying to avoid anxiety and blaming it on others instead.  
>  
>Here is another story. All the buddhas throughout space and time are practicing together along with each of us. I'm not really over here separate from you and all the buddhas, and you are not really out there on your own; there really is no here and there; you are not a threat to me, and I'm not a threat to you; we support each other, and we have no separate life; there is nothing out there to be afraid of, and everything that comes brings us our life; our true body is the entire universe; and to have a chance to live is something to be grateful for no matter what form it takes. That's the story.  
>  
>It's not that one of these stories is true and the other is false, and it's not that one is better than the other. The two are intimately connected, and the one liberates us from the other. Zen practice is not about preferring one of these stories over the other; it's about letting go of both of them.

&#x200B;

Just... *yes*. I have seen so many people hop out of one box (the first story) into another (the second story) and talk like they're suddenly awakened, but that's not the way. And here it is put in words in such a nice way, I couldn't help but revel in it."

Well, like I said, the decrease in matter in the amygdala and how it can become less reactive to stressful stimuli compared to controls over the course of eight weeks (activity in the amygdala largely being associated with fear and aversive emotions like disgust) would be a specific example of a change in brain structure and a change in behaviour linked to meditation... Correlation does not mean causation, the scientific method comes with its problems and biases, consciousness is a bag of worms to talk about and brain function and behaviour is a messy topic, but I think what I discussed fits the bill as far as you're saying. Another interesting line of discussion is disruption of the default mode network (DMN) and how that ties in with feelings of ""selflessness"", a phenomenon that's also been studied and documented with the use of psychedelics. Like you said...

> Like cardio and weights, meditation is an exercise with benefits... but making exercise into religion is a recipie for disaster.

Exactly, and I wish this was better understood. If I've been adamant to get across some of the points about meditation that I've made, it's to emphasise that meditation and Chan aren't mutually exclusive like a lot of meditators might think when they first come to this sub. It's just that meditation isn't ""the way"" and comes with problems if seen to be more than it actually is. When I first came to this sub years ago, it was easy to get the impression that meditation was seen as negative and was being outright ousted from the sub from how people were talking about it and how polarising the discussions were, and I think a lot of people take it that way when they first come here. But it really isn't like that lol. People have gotta see that it's not a polarity of ""good"" and ""bad"" we're talking about."
zen,fo88q60,t1_fo7qu8s,1587591938.0,"Ah yeah, I've come across these articles before. In fact, I wanted to include them in my dissertation and provide a critique of how Western secularism deals with meditation out of its original context, but it was a big tangent - there was no room for it. Not every mindfulness meditation method is based on the distance between one's attention and one's thoughts, but most are because of the therapeutic background in MBSR. Introducing that to a culture *rife* with individualism and egotism that commodifies every cultural import it touches? This is how you get smug mindfulness/yoga people who talk about getting rid of their ego but actually care about nothing else than their ego and self-advancement. *Buddhists in uproar*. There was a good paper about the Buddhist critique of Western mindfulness and its secular approach because of potential psychological dangers, but I lost the reference when clearing through my old uni folders. Shame.

Yes, alright, now that you phrase it that way and make it about *behaviour* and not just anatomical changes, that is a different question. The question of how brain structures and behaviour correlate is still an open debate, and cognitive neuroscience can only go so far standing on questionable assumptions. However, note that the structural changes that I discussed are actually lasting though, not just momentary in reaction to certain stimuli while in an altered state of consciousness. Structural changes to the amygdala (https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fscan%2Fnsp034) and subsequent stress resilience are the most obvious example of how structural changes in the brain due to meditation practice might affect behaviour and mental function, and that has been shown to be lasting outside of meditation(https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2012.00292).

In fact, on the Buddhist side, I hear you on the religious implications that arise when practising something like *vipassana* and focusing on the four noble truths, the five aggregates, dependent origination, and so forth. The theory - as you probably know - is that an altered state of consciousness can make certain insights about suffering and our existential condition easier to realise and integrate. In fact, the theory behind the oh-so-controversial *zazen*, quite similarly, is that by cultivating some non-judgmental distance from one's thoughts, realising pure attention and 'being' might provoke a sudden insight into one's true nature, similar to how Dzogchen meditation might try to bring the meditator inwards towards 'rigpa'. Introducing these ideas to a secular Western audience is indeed problematic without some kind of preparation on how to deal with conflicting thoughts or dangerous misinterpretations of practice - the most obvious example being the nihilistic understanding of 'emptiness'. For Buddhists, I would say that these practices aren't inherently 'dangerous' as they usually are better versed in the whole practice, where it leads and have experienced instructors better versed in the philosophy and method on hand, but for Westerners this is a completely different question.

I would be lying if I said that meditation - which I've been practising for a few years ever since I discovered it helped me cope with depression - hasn't helped me get my head around notions like 'non-duality' a bit when done a certain way - more than any mundane, non-meditative or cognitive state has, anyway (turns out altered states of consciousness can disrupt your ordinary, conditioned way of seeing the world - who knew?) - but I wouldn't say that that itself is any form of attainment or realisation. Only an idiot meditates and thinks they're hot shit. I also acknowledge that the duality implied in having an object of contemplation is an obstacle. The way I see it, meditation is just one way of inducing a state of perception, but it itself isn't ""the key"", if you see what I mean. Did it show me *the way*??? No. But did it induce a mental state where ""self"" and ""other"" is more fluid and you get to explore non-ordinary modes of thinking more than usual? Yeah. Does that mean lasting effects? Not sure, and not bothered - it's like hopping from one box into another or just pushing the box a little further out. Doesn't mean you've escaped it. Meditation - to me - isn't all religious, it's more general than that. It's essentially conducive to whatever you want to induce. The point with regards to Zen is not to induce anything, of course, but meditation is a method of achieving its own means for whatever purposes. It needs to be gotten rid of in the final thrust towards Buddhahood but it's no different from sitting, lying, walking or shitting ultimately - just another *dharma* amongst *dharmas* in the ultimate *dharma*."
zen,fo7o7c5,t1_fo7j6as,1587581688.0,"> As for zazen, since za [’sitting’] is the Buddha Mind’s sitting at ease, while zen [’meditation’] is another name for Buddha Mind, the Buddha Mind’s sitting at ease is what’s meant by zazen. So when you’re abiding in the Unborn, all the time is zazen; zazen isn’t just the time when you’re practicing formal meditation.

I had read this as Bankei stating that 'zazen' is more than just sitting meditation and is beyond just sitting, walking, lying, etc. and is residing in one's true nature.

As for brain stuff, yes, Fox et al. (2014) (https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neubiorev.2014.03.016) did mention that more research ought to be done on changes in the brain in response to long-term meditation practices and that their effect size was moderate (Cohen's d = 0.46), but their results still came out as positive for structural changes in the brain, namely in the prefrontal cortex and areas of the brain associated with body awareness. In fact, a follow-up study showed that different meditation styles produce differences in brain activity (https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neubiorev.2016.03.021), which should be enough to show that different meditation styles lead to different results.

In fact, I'll just copy-paste a section of my dissertation where I studied mindfulness and its effects on the time perception, which doesn't take into account the full breadth of effects I had to study beforehand. It probably won't mean much without the DOIs so you can read the study abstracts, or without an understanding of cognitive neuroscience. On top of that, it's only a scientific model, but one describing observed effects nonetheless:

>“Mindfulness” is a term used in English as an approximate translation of the Pali term sati (Sanskrit: smṛti ), which has been translated as “attention”, “awareness”, “recollection” and “retention” among other definitions. It is one of the eight spokes of the Noble Eightfold Path - which lies at the doctrinal core of Buddhism - and is given more or less importance depending on the Buddhist school in question. In psychology, it constitutes a particular relaxed yet very much wakeful state of broad awareness. Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn - the founder of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) therapy (Kabat-Zinn, 1990; 1994) - defines mindfulness as “present moment awareness”, which constitutes the basis of modern-day, Western ‘mindfulness meditation’. Indeed, it is now common to hear people speak of “mindfulness meditation” as a modern, secular practice. Kabat-Zinn - the founder of this practice - was a student of a few Zen masters and took inspiration from his Zen studies and from the American Vipassanā Movement of the 1970s, launching his MBSR program at MIT in 1979, which has since risen to success in combating a number of ailments (Grossman et al., 2004; Hayes et al., 2011; Zgierska et al., 2009; Hoffman, 2010). It is through his appropriation of Buddhist practices that we have come to know of “mindfulness” in the West nowadays, taking it in a secular form.
>
>Hölzel et al. (2011) outline four components which mindfulness acts on, the changes in which can characterise the cultivation of mindfulness: attention regulation, body awareness, emotional regulation and change in the perspective of self. They base their theory on previous findings, effectively showing that mindfulness meditation has an impact on each of these four components and that meditators perform differently to non-meditators according to their prowess in these four domains. Indeed, mindfulness practitioners claim that their practice allows them to focus their attention for extended periods of time (Barinaga, 2003), and it has also been shown that meditators perform better than controls in executive attention tasks (Jha et al., 2007; Slagter et al., 2007; Valentine & Sweet, 1999; van den Hurk et al. 2010), that meditators have better interoception than non-meditators (Khalsa et al., 2008; Nielsen & Kaszniak, 2006), show less emotional interference than controls when exposed to affective pictures (Ortner et al., 2007), and can effectively perceive their mental sensations - including the sense of self - with increasing clarity and temporal resolution (MacLean et al., 2010), effectively allowing them to see their sense of self as a mental event rather than an inherent, individual experience (Olendzki, 2006). Measurements have been developed accordingly, such as the mindfulness attention awareness scale (MAAS) (Ryan & Brown, 2003), which evaluates how mindful an individual is in general life as which was the principal tool used in evaluating mindfulness in the paper by Navarro-Haro et al. (2017).
> [...]
> A number of areas in the brain are affected by mindfulness meditation, with engagement in the activity showing an activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (Zeidan et al., 2012) and an increase in grey matter volume in the hippocampus and parietal lobes even only after brief periods (Jensen, Day & Miro, 2014). We can postulate from the known functions of these brain regions that the primary cognitive modules affected are attention, decision making, morality, impulse control and emotion. One emotion particularly affected is fear, as participation in MBSR programmes has been shown to correlate with decreases in the grey matter of the basolateral right amygdala (Hölzel et al., 2010) and the vmPFC - particularly activated during mindfulness meditation - is thought to
play an inhibitory role on the amygdala (Motzkin et al., 2015), the amygdala being the area of the brain chiefly associated with fear. In fact, there is some evidence to show that practising mindfulness meditation over a certain period of time can lead to structural changes in the brain, including increased cortical thickness and decreased worry, depression and anxiety (Santarnecchi et al., 2014), structural changes in areas associated with addiction at the heart of the attention-emotion-appraisal interface (Garland, Froeliger & Howard, 2014), changes in the prefrontal cortex and areas associated with body awareness (Fox et al., 2014). 
>
>Mindfulness meditation has been correlated with a number of positive factors. It has been shown that mindfulness meditation can yield a number of cognitive benefits (Chiesa, Calati & Serretti, 2011; Chambers, Lo & Allen, 2008), for example increasing focus (Lazar, Kerr, Wasserman et al., 2005), attention (Jha, Krompinger & Baime, 2007) and working memory (Mrazek et al., 2013). In terms of subjective well-being, a number of meta-analyses have been conducted in order to evaluate the effects of mindfulness programs, coming back with positive results (Gotink et al., 2015; Sharma & Rush, 2014; Sequeira, 2014). Even brief mindfulness meditation in novices has also been shown to improve attention (Norris et al., 2018). Effects have also been found on time-perception (Kramer, Weger & Sharma, 2013; Thönes & Wittmann, 2016), showing an increase in time sensitivity (Droit-Volet, Fanget & Dambrun, 2015). It is this that we base our measurements on, finding it to be a reasonable objective measurement of mindfulness. Wittman and Schmidt (2014) explore time perception in meditators in their paper, evaluating past findings and the potential causes for the slowing in time perception that meditators experience. It is well established at this point that those in a state of mindfulness experience time differently, experiencing it slower (Kramer, Weger & Sharma, 2013; Thönes & Wittmann, 2016) and experiencing a broader sense of ‘now’ (Carter et al. 2005; Sauer et al. 2012) but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is not well understood. The authors explore these mechanisms in function of the four functional aspects outlined by Hölzel et al. (2011).
>
>Their paper explains that one’s consciousness can be seen as “an island of presence in the continuous flow of time”, caught between the sense of ‘now’ and the sense of the flow of time. Effectively, our sense of time in this regard relies on our working memory, as our mental presence is based on the integration of the events we perceive over time. As such, the cultivation of one’s awareness leads to less gaps in memory by virtue of having paid more
attention to one’s surroundings on average and can lead to a broader experience of the sensory ‘now’. In fact, increases in working memory are associated with meditators (Jha et al.
2010; Zeidan et al. 2010), who are less prone to distractions on certain tasks than controls. In fact, working memory performance is associated with more accuracy in both prospective and
retrospective temporal judgement tasks (Zakay and Block 1997; Brown 1997; Pütz et al. 2012; Ulbrich et al. 2007, 2009). As such, we might hypothesise that working memory plays
a direct role in increasing time sensitivity and thereby stretching out one’s sense of ‘now’. The part of the brain associated with this increase in attention regulation is the ACC (Hölzel
et al., 2007) and an increased thickness of the grey matter in the dorsal portion of this region is associated with meditators (Grant et al., 2010). The ACC is associated with the detection
and mediation of conflicting stimuli, or distractions. It effectively helps to focus one’s attention on a given stimulus instead of getting distracted by other stimuli.

This is only mindfulness meditation that's being discussed, the secular practice developed by Jon Kabatt-Zinn with influence from Soto zazen and Thai Forest tradition *vipassana*. Whether these effects are lasting without keeping up practice is another question, but the effects are there. They won't make you a Buddha, but we already know that lol"

Just to emphasise the anti-Buddhist-doctrine point some more, Master Yunmen Wenyan said:

>The old masters couldn't help it. When they saw you run about aimlessly, they said to you ""supreme wisdom (bodhi) and nirvana."" They really buried you; they drove in a stake and tied you to it. Again, when they saw that you didn't understand, they said to you, ""It's not bodhi and nirvana."" Knowing this sort of thing already shows that you're down on your luck; [but to make matters worse] you're looking for comments and explanations by others. You exterminators of Buddhism, you've been like this all along! And where has this brought you today?""

Now, as for the nature of mind, Master Huangbo Xiyun is the best source to consult, but unfortunately I don't have any annotations in my book so I can't find what might be the *best* quotes to use. Instead, I'll just give these examples:

> The Master said to me: All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists. This Mind, which is without beginning, is unborn and indestructible. It is not green nor yellow, and has neither form nor appearance. It does not belong to the categories of things which exist or do not exist, not can it be thought of in terms of new or old. It is neither long nor short, big nor small, for it transcends all limits, measures, names, traces and comparisons. It is that which you see before you - begin to reason about it and you at once fall into error. It is like the boundless void which cannot be fathomed or measured. The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is no distinction between the Buddha and sentient things, but that sentient beings are attached to forms and so seek externally for Buddhahood. By their very seeking they lose it, for that is using the Buddha to seek for the Buddha and using mind to grasp Mind. Though they do their utmost for a full aeon, they will not be able to attain to it. They do not know that, if they put a stop to conceptual thought and forget their anxiety, the Buddha will appear before them, for this Mind is the Buddha and the Buddha is all living beings. It is not the less for being manifested in ordinary beings, nor is it greater for being manifested in the Buddhas.

> Mind is like the void in which there is no confusion or evil, as when the sun wheels through it shining upon the four corners of the world. For, when the sun rises and illuminates the whole earth, the void gains not in brilliance; and, when the sun sets, the void does not darken. The phenomena of light and dark alternate with each other but the nature of the void remains unchanged. So it is with the Mind of the Buddha and of sentient beings. If you look upon the Buddha as presenting a pure, bright or Enlightened appearance, or upon sentient beings as presenting a foul, dark or mortal-seeming appearance, these conceptions resulting from attachment to form will keep you from supreme knowledge, even after the passing of as many aeons as there are sands in the Ganges. There is only the One Mind and not a particle of anything else on which to lay hold, for this Mind is the Buddha. If you students of the Way do not awake to this Mind substance, you will overlay Mind with conceptual thought, you will seek the Buddha outside yourselves, and you will remain attached to forms, pious practices and so on, all of which are harmful and not at all the way to supreme knowledge.

> This mind is no mind of conceptual thought and it is completely detached from form. So Buddhas and sentient beings do not differ at all. If you can only rid yourselves of conceptual thought, you will have accomplished everything. But if you students of the Way do not rid yourselves of conceptual thought in a flash, even though you strive for aeon after aeon, you will never accomplish it. Enmeshed in the meritorious practices of the Three Vehicles, you will be unable to attain Enlightenment. Nevertheless, the realization of the One Mind may come after a shorter or a longer period. There are those who, upon hearing this teaching, rid themselves of conceptual thought in a flash. There are others who do this after following through the Ten Beliefs, the Ten Stages, the Ten Activities and the Ten Bestowals of Merit. Yet others accomplish it after passing through the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva's Progress. But whether they transcend conceptual thought by a longer or a shorter way, the result is a state of being: there is no pious practising and no action of realizing. That there is nothing which can be attained is not idle talk; it is the truth. Moreover, whether you accomplish your aim in a single flash of thought or after going through the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva's Progress, the achievement will be the same; for this state of being admits of no degrees, so the latter method merely entails aeons of unnecessary suffering and toil."
zen,fo6po63,t1_fo6cj0j,1587564274.0,"Indeed. OP might find that as they explore the history and context of a lot of Eastern philosophy that politics had a big role to play in different traditions' divergences and developments. The most classic example that comes to my mind is how Confucianism and Taoism and their popularity during the Warring States period of Chinese history can be seen are different responses and approaches to the notion of ""harmony"". 

Things got even more messy and interesting as Buddhism came into the picture too. Different philosophies and religions had to alter and develop according to the political situations of certain states and their political favour. Taoism had to adopt a lot of religious aspects to keep up in popularity and not become irrelevant in certain contexts. Chán could be argued to have been a product of its time too, but I won't open a Pandora's box of historical debate here.

Just because Eastern philosophy is more spiritual, doesn't mean history and politics haven't left their mark on it!"
zen,fo6o1hx,t3_g5xgyz,1587563322.0,"You're discussing an idea that's originally from Buddhist philosophy, and seeing as Zen (Chán) eschews all attachments - including to lofty Buddhist teachings - you won't get much support here.

But do not fear, I will bother to explain just to satisfy your curiosity. I have a blog post here (https://emptinessinmotion.wixsite.com/neuronsatadistance/post/the-nature-of-consciousness-and-mind) which explains the nature of the self in Buddhism and ties Zen and the nature of mind into it through a more Dzogchen lense of understanding (Dzogchen is a bit more conceptually elaborate than Zen, which is like being tossed into a lake and told to swim for the unfamiliar), but for the Zen understanding you ought to toss out all the philosophy and conceptual elaboration and just jump straight to the point through experience and without words.

Edit: Here is the part that ought to outline it for you:

> In order to first elaborate on the nature of consciousness and of mind, we must discuss the nature of the 'self' as described in Buddhism. In Western philosophy, we usually subscribe to the notion that we are a mind or soul inhabiting a physical body and that all facets of this mind are a part of our identity. This can also be seen to a certain degree in the Hindu concept of an ""atman"" or eternal soul. In Buddhism however, no such self exists. Instead, our sense of self is an illusion that arises from the second level of our consciousness (which we will discuss momentarily) which is responsible for our dualistic understanding of the world in terms of ""self"" and ""other"", ""subject"" and ""object"", ""perceiver"" and ""perceived"" and so forth. The self, if closely examined, is composed of five closely interacting aggregates which interact so closely that we might conceive of them as being one single ""self"". These aggregates are:
>
>
>1. Consciousness (*we will discuss this one shortly*)
>
>2. Form (*physical manifestations; in this case, the physical body*)
>
>3. Feelings (*our pleasant, unpleasant and neutral sensations on an everyday basis*)
>
>4. Perceptions (*perceptual delineations and discriminations between different objects and notions*)
>
>5. Motivational tendencies (*our impulses and desires*)
>
>
>Whether or not one agrees that these are in fact the definitive five essential building blocks of a ""self"" is not important, as we will actually see that these five concepts are in fact all empty of any independent essence and therefore are only illusions themselves, arising from the aggregate of perceptions. In Buddhism, nothing in this world exists independently from anything else, and therefore everything is conditioned by what is ""other"" to it. [...] The same can be said of us, and it is for this reason that we are not in fact imbued with an independently individual permanent essence according to Buddhism, and nothing - not even our mental concepts or mental chatter - has any independent essence and always arises in response to something else. [...] The world is in a constant state of conditioning and flux, and a Buddha (an awakened one) realises this fact but also realises the underlying nature of this chain of cause and effect. [...] We live in a relative reality of our own conceptual understanding where we only see what our senses and what our mind will allow us to. Beyond our senses and mind is the ""ultimate"" or ""absolute"" reality, which we will come back to later. Ultimately, all of the aggregates - the aggregate of perception included - arise from the aggregate of consciousness, which we will now discuss.
>
>
>The aggregate of consciousness - can be sub-divided into eight levels:
>
>
>1. The ground of all consciousness (the thing which Zen and Dzogchen directly point to)
>
>2. The deluded consciousness (from which our sense of self and other dualistic misapprehensions arise, giving rise to the aggregate of perceptions and form)
>
>3. The mental consciousness (our conceptual mind, the mind of mental chatter and abstractions, constantly dipping into the past and future)
>
>4. Visual consciousness
>
>5. Auditory consciousness
>
>6. Olfactory consciousness
>
>7. Gustative consciousness
>
>8. Tactile consciousness
>
>
>As you can see, the last five levels are in fact the five senses which we are all familiar with, with which we grasp at the aggregate of form, which itself arises from the deluded consciousness. Ultimately however, all aggregates and all levels of consciousness originate from the same source - the same underlying, all-pervasive element, the ground of all consciousness itself. It is at this point that we will have to start to rely more on introspection to guide us in understanding this concept. It is also at this point that I choose to differentiate the term ""consciousness"" from ""mind"", which are often both used as synonyms in the texts I evoked in my introductory paragraph. If we examine our present conscious experience and strip away each of the latter seven levels of consciousness (our senses, our mental chatter, our fundamental perceptual biases of dualistic subject/object dichotomies and other dualistic misapprehensions), we are left with nothing but pure awareness itself - just the simple fact that we are aware of any of the other overlaying levels of consciousness, the fact that we are aware of and can sense anything at all. It it here that I distinguish 'consciousness' as this pure awareness and 'mind' as its overlaying features, keeping in line with the Dzogchen differentiation of awareness (rigpa) and mind (sems) in Tibetan. Ultimately, they are both the same as they arise from the same source, but they are not to be confused. 
>
>
>At the root of all our experience is an ever-present awareness, which Tantric Buddhists maintain is present even during phases of deep sleep or dreaming, but which must be realised and refined, therefore inviting practitioners to engage in ""dream yoga"" (essentially lucid dreaming with meditational aspects). This is the ground of all consciousness. Beyond all sensory perception, the dualistic understanding of ""self"" and ""other"" and other dualistic misapprehensions, we have a pure awareness which perceives all other levels of consciousness and form. However, to say that there is a subject to this awareness is wrong, as there is in fact none. This awareness is primordial and is beyond any notion of subjectivity - which implies objectivity as well and is fabricated by the deluded consciousness at the second level of the eight levels of consciousness. If we examine this consciousness, we will find that it is in fact beyond duality, as this excerpt from chapter 4 of the ""Tibetan Book of the Dead"" explains:
>
>
>>""First, recognise that past thoughts are traceless, clear and empty [of any independently arising existence],
>>
>>Second, recognise that future thoughts are unproduced and fresh,
>>
>>And third, recognise that the present moment abides naturally and unconstructed.
>>
>>When this ordinary, momentary consciousness is examined nakedly and directly by oneself,
>>
>>Upon examination, it is a radiant awareness,
>>
>>Which is free from the presence of an observer,
>>
>>Manifestly stark and clear,
>>
>>Completely empty and uncreated in all aspects,
>>
>>Lucid, without duality of radiance and emptiness,
>>
>>Not permanent, for it is lacking inherent existence in all respects,
>>
>>Not a mere nothingness for it is radiant and clear,
>>
>>Not a single entity, for it is clearly perceptible as a multiplicity,
>>
>>Yet not existing inherently as a multiplicity, for it is indivisible and of a single savour.""
>
>
>This description of our underlying awareness - our consciousness - requires our own self-examination in order to understand it firsthand. Methods outlined in Chan (the original Chinese branch of Zen) such as the ""hua tou"" method point directly to this duality of emptiness and form in the mind, asking practitioners to examine where thoughts come from before they arise. The instruction to ""observe the observer"" is also a common and useful one, as it serves to reveal that there is no subject behind this awareness and that chasing after one is in fact futile. A mirror cannot reflect itself, just as much as the eye cannot see itself directly. The mind cannot grasp itself. This consciousness is in fact empty because it is insubstantial - made up of nothing - and all its mental phenomena do not arise independently, yet it is not void for it is ever radiant and luminous, shining outwards and perceiving all that it touches (although the reader must be warned that the dualistic implications of this phrasing severely limit our understanding of this fundamental awareness). Likewise, it is neither a singularity or a multiplicity. This ground of all consciousness is beyond the dualistic conceptualisations that arise from our deluded consciousness and it is for this reason that we struggle to accurately encapsulate it and express it verbally, as language is fundamentally dualistic. Language utilises concepts that delineate aspects of reality and contrast them to all that is ""other"" to them, as we saw with the example of the tree. However, as we also saw, this is only an illusion. Our consciousness is beyond the relative reality in which we try to ground it by grasping at it mental concepts created by the mind. What is it then?

I won't deny the suffering is real at the time it's experienced. This post isn't aimed at the people in Hell.

Sure, the plan is that we both hide our heads in the sand for so long that we forget all the words and concepts in our lexicon, and once we've attained that state, we'll discuss how to... Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get there. 

But in the meantime, arguing about semantics is like arguing over the beetles in our boxes, to borrow from Wittgenstein. John says ""Zen"" and has his concept of what that Zen ""looks like"" - it's got red stripes. Sarah says ""Zen"" and staunchly disagrees with red-stripe Zen, which is daft because beetles don't have red stripes - right? Neither can look in each other's boxes and have to guess at what the other means. And sure, we could go through that whole process and argue again and again, but I'd rather save my breath. We've seen this stuff about Dogen so many times now, and everyone is always up in arms about it.

Bodhidharma brought his lamp from the West. Are all iterations of Ch'an and its descendents carrying that same flame? That's another question. But as for the names, they are but names and I don't adhere to any of them. Better to do away with them altogether.
