Another consideration is maybe get that money saved from 3300X and go for a 500 series board for future compatibily.

Bonus tip if he doesn't play games with anti cheat (popular examples includes Fortnite and Roblox) then he might consider using Linux, here are the reasons why.

1. Much much less chance that he'll download a virus.

2. Doesn't update in the background and all updates are managed at one place.

3. On AMD cards, they can play games out of the box.

4. Only 2 websites are needed for games: lutris (for non steam) and protondb (for steam).

5. He can eventually learn the ins and out of how a kernel/an OS works.

6. Customize the ui however he likes.

7. And finally, money saved because it's free.
