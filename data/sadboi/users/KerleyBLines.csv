I definitely think that's an issue of consent. However I'll just chime in and say that with certain kids, if you don't push them to try a sport, hobby, or instrument, some kids just won't try anything and will never know if they like it or not. I wont force my kids to continue if they don't want to, but if you don't make them try it (like vegetables), they may never do it and regret it later in adulthood. 

I have one kid that is very naturally outgoing and energetic and very vocal about things they want to do. The other one would just sit around and watch TV all day if you let them. If I let them sit around and do nothing but watch movies, I would be doing them a disservice as a parent, so I have to ""force"" them to go play outside play a game, do crafts, etc, and usually they are happy and enjoy it once they start. I am not going to force them to do things if they aren't feeling well, or if it turns out that whatever sport/instrument isn't their thing, then at least they tried it. Better than being me, an adult, wishing I had learned the piano or learned to sew & crochet from my grandmother before she died but didn't because I was a fucking lazy teenager with ""better things to do"" (sleep/listen to sad music/hang out with people who weren't good for me/feel sorry for myself)."

However, feminism is a label for an ideology that benefits both men and women and can be adopted by any gender. It isn't an inherent identity trait like LGBTQIA+ or race/culture/ethnicity, in which of you don't belong or didn't grow up in one of those subgroups, you can by definition only be an ally. Anyone can read feminist literature, become a feminist, and execute feminism in practice without identifying as feminine. If you reverse it, it would be like saying that women can't be misogynist, but nobody argues that internalized misogyny isn't real and that women can only be misogynist ""allies"" or enablers. Women can very much participate actively in misogyny. 

I mean, how counterproductive is it to say to a man who identifies himself as feminist and engages in feminist praxis that, ""you identify as cis male there fore you aren't a real feminist,""? It's reeeally gatekeep-y and treads dangerously close to TERF ideology, imo.

I was just saying that historically there is a causative link between increased pay & prestige and men in a particular trade or occupation. So perhaps if early childhood and secondary school teaching did grow to be more male populated, teachers would be paid more."
MensLib,fn9mk5b,t1_fn8f0mj,1586778496.0,">There are also far fewer male teachers, partly because men are looked at with suspicion if they want a career that entails being around children.

There may be some of this. Teachers have to be kind, nurturing, and patient with children, and it is a disgusting symptom of toxic masculinity that men aren't allowed to be viewed as good with children without being thought of as having an ulterior motive by some. 

However, I would argue that a bigger piece is economic. Fewer men are k-12 education in the US because it is a low paying job that confers little status or respect in American society. [Programming, coding, and computer work were traditionally ""women's work"" and thought of as secretarial](https://www.history.com/news/coding-used-to-be-a-womans-job-so-it-was-paid-less-and-undervalued). The jobs were menial and low paying and the women who worked them got no recognition until very recently (and posthumously, for some). When men started migrating to the job, the pay and prestige associated with it went up. The story with nursing has a similar trajectory. With K-12 teaching it's the same picture that hasn't gone to the second phase: few men in the profession means low pay and low prestige. We actually need more men not only for being good role models for boys and young men, but also to improve material conditions for all teachers, which would improve the US educational system for all students, boys and girls."

COMPLETEANARCHY,flyers6,t1_fly8gbw,1585600797.0,"Don't think of it as a correction as much as an elaboration of what you already said. I'm not proud of being really familiar with a cop sitcom or anything. I've been rewatching the episodes lately because social isolation/unemployment, and I just recently saw that episode."
COMPLETEANARCHY,fly417p,t1_flxuu2y,1585595129.0,"Terry Crews' character is a sergeant and is stopped by a cop and handcuffed in his own neighborhood at night while he is looking for his kids stuffed toy. He tries to report the cop, (who says ""he never would have cuffed him if he knew he was a cop"") to his captain. The captain, who is also black, discourages him doing so and refuses to send the paperwork up. When Sgt Jeffords insists on pursuing the complaint, he is then denied some collateral duty he applied for prior to the incident and the show heavily implies it's because he filed the complaint against the racist cop. 

I'm not defending copaganda per se because there is some of that, but it actually does address these topics more so than other cop shows. It mostly shows them as a bunch of bumbling dumbasses who tend to get lucky solving crimes. Even the ""criminals"" on the show are likeable, like Doug and Trudy Judy. 

ACAB but that show is funny, IMO."

pagan,flamjt6,t1_fl9sfs7,1584986826.0,Santeria is its own specific religion with rituals and practices associated with Carribean culture. Saint Veneration in folk religion has happened in all cultures & ethnicities since Christianity began.
pagan,flalcip,t1_fl99n7g,1584986145.0,"If it was any other saint I would have just scrolled past this post without looking twice. But Nuestra SÃ±a. de Guadalupe is an ethnic symbol of liberation and solidarity beyond simply religion for many mestizos and indigenous Mexicans. [She is also thought by many religious scholars as a syncretic apparition of the Aztec Earth Goddess, Tontantzin.](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-12-16-me-14709-story.html)

I'm not ""offended"" by those novelty devotional candles of Mary with tattoos or dressing provocatively, for example. But Our Lady of Guadalupe represents more than just Catholicism. And I'm not ""mad"" at OP either, or really that offended at all, it was obviously done with good intentions, but knowing what I know about Her (this specific apparition of Mary), I just don't personally care for it. 

Disclaimer: I am not Mexican but I am a brown/mixed race person. I grew up Catholic and am my practice still revolves around Saint Veneration as well as syncretic meanings behind the Saints, in which pagans adopted the symbolism of Christianity to continue to worship old gods and avoid persecution. i.e., when I call upon Saints, I recognize that a lot of these Saints may have not existed at all but can be/are actually these old gods given new names, like St. Demetrius/Demeter & St. Bridget/Brigid, or were early Christians but inherited the roles of old gods. The story of the Resurrection of Christ himself is syncreticism at work."

bipolar,fl671zl,t3_fmoxtv,1584856626.0,"Yeah and even with depression/anxiety, they still mean the ""easy"", socially acceptable anxiety/depression. Not the ""why are you still in your clothes from 3 days ago? Work has been trying to get ahold of you. You are fired for not showing up since the last time you changed your clothes, do you know what day it is? It smells like low tide in here"" depression or the ""You have no eyebrows and bald patches in your hair from trichotillomania""/""Stop picking your skin you're bleeding"" anxiety. People want depression to look like, ""I need to practice self care"" and ""support"" you by taking you out to get a Boba Tea and then not calling again for a month. And when people think of anxiety they're just thinking of stress, not the debilitating real shit that many of us live with. Once shit starts to get ugly they are really quick to get you involuntarily sectioned or rat about how """"concerned"" they are about you to your boss/professors. Like dude getting me fired is not going to help so shove your ""Mental Health Awareness/Support"" BS straight up your butt and piss up a rope.

Yeah I guess this hit a nerve."
