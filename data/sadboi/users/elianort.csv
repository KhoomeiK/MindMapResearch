Dermatology,eyv1jk0,t3_cyyhtr,1567477939.0,idk i’m definitely not a physician. i’ll link you a video of where i saw it first because i may be remembering wrong. i just know this was a symptom but i’m sure it could be way less serious https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKb55NTwSK0&feature=share
BreakUps,euo2q5y,t3_cfta0e,1563936570.0,relationships are the scariest thing to me sometimes. i really feel that same way right now. i’m so afraid that when i finally fulfill my potential of self love that i’ll meet someone that completely takes me right back to where i started. it’s horrifying. i AM making progress in a short amount of time after this recent break up mostly because my therapist is really helpful but i do feel myself taking a step back every time i take two steps forward. i know i’ll get there though. i’ve been trying really hard to connect to my “inner child” and imagine feeling the same way towards that little girl as i do towards myself. practice nurturing myself. all i know is i seriously don’t want to go back to my old way of thinking. also idk how old you are but i heard on a podcast somewhere that a lot of people have experience having a really intense failed relationship in their twenties that teaches them giant life lessons. maybe that’s this for us. we got this.
BreakUps,euchkng,t3_cfta0e,1563675321.0,"a week ago i was was broken up with. he told me something so cliché, “you need to love yourself before anyone can love you.” for 7 months he told me he loved me and as he was ending things he told me he was lying to himself.... ow. it seems so unfair and it’s so painful but i kind of think he was right. i’m 24 and my whole life I’d been telling myself that what i wanted was love from another person. but the TRUTH is that i want to just love myself. and to be extremely dependent and happy on my own. THAT is what i truly want. it’s hard and it’s only been a week but i’m trying my best to not feel guilty for grieving the nonexistent love of another person. i have to come out stronger."
