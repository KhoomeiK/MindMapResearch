GetStudying,fdc99ky,t3_ekacas,1578269621.0,"I’m going back to school after taking a health leave for the fall semester. I’m so nervous. Not only is it hard for me to study, but I feel so self conscious going to class and interacting with people. Which makes my anxiety worse and makes it even harder to study."
introvert,fdc8spt,t3_ekcz7t,1578269345.0,I totally agree. I feel like I don’t even want to go to my college graduation because of this. Is that a bad thing?
depression,fca8ydj,t3_eb0ggo,1577564903.0,"This is the exact feeling I’m having right now. I watch motivation videos on YouTube to try and motivate myself to do anything, and it’s always the same shit. I make the lists, I plan my schedule thoroughly. But I still don’t do anything but sleep a lot and watch YouTube videos. On the one hand I feel like I’m wasting my life, but on the other hand it is a lot of effort and stress to be “successful.”"
conspiracy,ey8zl7k,t1_ey8yk1s,1566931890.0,"If we aren’t conscious, then what are we? I guess we don’t exactly know what consciousness is if we aren’t actually conscious. Usually consciousness is being self aware or perceptive to the world, which we are. So then are other animals conscious too? What are we when we are unconscious? Are we not conscious because we don’t know if we’re actually in a simulation or not?"
