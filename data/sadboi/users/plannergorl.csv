LifeProTips,fq0qkxc,t1_fq06nch,1589036133.0,"There‚Äôs a really great Ted Talk by Andrew Solomon and he talks about how therapy and meds work (I totally agree) but that it‚Äôs better to find these extra helps (e.g medication) because:
‚ÄúSomeone said I can get through this it will only last a year or two‚Äù
And I told them, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôll never be 27 again. You‚Äôll never be 28 again‚Äù .

I take that to mean yes, some people suffer from depression or bipolar or borderline personality disorder for the rest of their lives but there are things that help and I promise they do help. No I don‚Äôt always have energy to do things but i know it‚Äôs a brain imbalance and not a personal attack on me. And that‚Äôs true for you, too. 

You are worth of all good things and happiness. Give yourself a little room for not perfect and find what helps you be a better you. üíï 

As an example from my life (sorry I don‚Äôt know why the font changed)  I was medicated for a while and started therapy and made changes in my life (divorce being a key element) and I no longer am on medication, though I do keep back up meds in case I have a really bad day. I still do therapy but I‚Äôve cut it back and I am doing much better."

When I was at my lowest point I told one of my dear friends and‚Äùadopted moms‚Äù and she told me to go talk to my mom. That was so scary for me. Being vulnerable like that. My mom was supportive and helped get me in to see a dr for medication to help. But talking to a counselor helped the most (oh, I was in my late 20s). If you have a hard time saying it.
