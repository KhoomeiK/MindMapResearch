Well, I actually had lyme, pneumonia and anemia apart from Perimyocarditis, so I had lost all color in the face, couldn't shake my fever, I was tired obviously, and I had to train my lunge to get enough air. The paleness came from the anemia. Usually inflammations of the heart aren't that dangerous, but if you have other stuff going on, it can be deadly. Also, listen to your body. Not being able to lie flat or bend over, is a tell tale sign."
EDAnonymous,fr44tw8,t3_gmittg,1589875845.0,"Where is the pain located? In the middle of your chest? On your left or your right side? I used to have heart problems, and usually if it's something with the heart, the pain will radiate towards your back as well. Do you have a fever? Also, if you can pinpoint where the pain is located, it usually is acid reflux or some other stomach issues, because with most heart issues, you can't really pinpoint where the pain is located. Try some yoghurt or anti-acid medication, and if it doesn't get better, go to the hospital. 

I tried to ignore the pain at first, but then ended up begging my dad to drive me to the hospital because I couldn't breathe, had 104 f, and couldn't lie on my back. It turned out I had an infection of the heart, and could have died if I didn't go when I did."

I believe that she thinks that she loves me, and she doesn't understand why I am behaving the way I am toward her. She thinks that she can keep on shallowly giving me affection, while still beating me down constantly. I don't think she knows how to truly love her children."

BPD,fqta850,t3_gktk2b,1589634433.0,"Also: We tend to read into behaviors and changes too much (no shit), and for them, they probably don't even notice that things have changed, because they don't overthink relationships like we do. They just go with the flow. I always have to remind myself of that he wouldn't be with me if he didn't love me still. We have been together for 8 years now, and everyday life gets boring. For me it's thrilling just to go to IKEA (but he hates it), but for me it's a date. Try to go to a fancy restaurant some time, or cook a nice meal together at home. Light a candle, drink some wine. Play board games, look at old pictures of you together. Or watch a really trashy movie and make fun of it, like The Room. Suggest to do something together with his friends as well. I've noticed that my boyfriend loves it when I do that, because I often nag about him hanging out too much with his friends or get upset when he is with them instead of me. But he understands that I do it out of jealousy. As I said, he would rather do all that stuff with his friends, AND me."
BPD,fqt9lci,t3_gktk2b,1589633951.0,"I know how you feel. My boyfriend likes to sail, I don't. He is often away for at least one long sailing trip (at least a week) during the summer, and my anxiety always rises through the roof during these trips when he's away. And he usually doesn't text or calls too often as well, as he is the only one who really knows how to sail in his friend group and obviously is occupied. 

Last summer he was going for 10 days and I freaked out and after 5 days I called him in the middle of the night and really begged him to come how earlier. He said that he didn't want to do that. It broke my heart. 

He says he wants to do these fun things with me, but I am often not in the mood or have social anxiety. I hate that I'm so... what's the word.. confined? in my anxiousness, that it fucks with my relationship. 

I work early mornings, and he often goes out with his friends, and I can't join, because I have to get up at 4 in the morning, and I feel so lonely. Our schedules often don't match up. And then he comes home nest day and tells me what they did, and I get jealous, because I couldn't be there and experience these moments with him. And it's not unusual for me to call him when he is out with his friends and ask him to come home, but he rarely does that when I ask, and we fight. 

And like you said, my boyfriend also behaves differently with his friends compared to when he is with me. They always laugh so loudly when they are together and I am in the bedroom trying to sleep (either because of work or because I got tired before them), and I often feel not good enough for him. Like my company isn't as exciting. But then I think of moments like last week, where we decided to sit in the garden and play drunken chess. It was hilarious!

BPD,fqq9htq,t3_gkcakp,1589561683.0,"This is a hard one, as I don't know your relationship. Personally, I would be really not okay with that. My boyfriend hasn't had any other relationship before me, so I wouldn't know how it feels when your partner has contact with their ex. I don't have any contact with my exes and my boyfriend doesn't like it whenever I talk about them casually.

Sending selfies seems to be a dangerous zone. You send someone a selfie to remind that person about you, of memories you had together. If you don't see them, you only see that person as the image you have of them in your head, but getting a personal picture of them is a special thing. The other person probably posed for at least a few pictures to make it look good. I don't trust her honestly. Even if she doesn't have feelings for him, I guess that women can be a bit competitive. Be cautious and tell your boyfriend when you think that you can't take it anymore and that it makes you uncomfortable.  Having contact with your sex is not the norm. 

Trying to not give in to your jealous impulses is great and I am amazed that you have been able to treat the situation as you have been, but if it is hurting you, you need to make your feelings clear to him. He doesn't know how you feel."

But every time I stay at their home, I cry at least once. My mom is so good at finding those sweet, sweet triggers and takes a jab at me here and there.

She commented that she could see why I would need it. It broke my heart, but I just went on like nothing happened. It still hurts when I think about it now. 

Off topic: I have also come to realize over the years that she would flirt with the guys I had a crush on or was in a relationship with. Not overtly, but subtly. It made me fear to introduce her to my current boyfriend. We all hung out once, and I felt like she was way too friendly with him and was way too interested and I felt like the third wheel almost.

We are so different in many ways, and I feel inferior. It feels like he is with me out of habit.  


And like with you, I also always compliment him, tell him that he looks cute when he loos cute, that he did a great job fixing something, that he is smart and whatever, but I rarely get an ""wow, this dress looks amazing on you"", or ""this painting you did last week really is amazing"", or even a ""thank you for washing the clothes"".

It's about a bunch of privileged smart college students, and a guy who tries to fit in by disguising himself as a rich kid, and it doesn't work out the way he wanted it to. It's about language, mythology, drugs, alcohol, sex and love and murder within the friend-group.

But yeah, having an fp is not a criterea, but it's not uncommon for someone with bpd to have had that kind of relationship over and over in their lives."
raisedbynarcissists,fp39y78,t1_fp398jd,1588275654.0,"Well she actually told me that too tbh. When I told her I had was depressed during high-school and that I didn't go to school because of that, she just said I was lazy. And to this day she tells me that I should find some rich old man to marry, so I don't have to work, but that I'm not pretty enough, or that I should finish my degree, but she also says that I'm too lazy to actually finish it. Ugh.

What I meant with that she said that not everybody can be good at school is, that she downplayed my mental health. She minimized it. She wasn't trying to be kind or supportive. Like when I told her about my bpd, she said that everybody feels down sometimes."
raisedbynarcissists,fp34bge,t3_gb153y,1588272849.0,"Hell yeah. I am always so shocked when someone tells me what my mother has been saying about me. I can like tell her something over the phone, and then like 2 hours later my brother calls me up to talk with me about the things I had told to her.

You really can't tell them anything. I had to bun up my diary I got from her when I was a kid. I had it for like 2 months maybe, and then she goes and looks though it, only to bring some stuff up over dinner with guests. Lovely. Gosh I get so freaking riled up thinking about that betrayal."
raisedbynarcissists,fp33iir,t3_gb1e7y,1588272458.0,"Omg, I have been there sooo many times. It's always so frustrating, and I always forget how pointless these discussions are, because these people will never validate you ever. 

I have told my parents that I am being evaluated for ADD, and then I explained how much trouble I had in school when I was younger, and how much trouble I had in university, and the funny thing is that my mom always talks about how bad I was in school. Always. But when I tell her this might be because of a condition called ADHD (it's so weird to having to explain it to them, because as you said, everybody has heard of ADHD), she says that not everybody can be good in school, and it's normal to have problems. Yeah? I don't know how normal it is to almost fail 4th grade, and then again in 7th, and then actually fail my last year in high-school, so I had to repeat that year. And then kind of fail that year again, so I had to go to community collage for a year. 

Anyway... It's better not to talk to these people about yourself, at all. I know it's hard, and I always forget as well not to give them any kind of information, but I still want to have pity and be liked by her, but I always end up shooting myself in the foot."

I know that some people love him and are very protective of him, but there are 4 guys in the group and you can't always like everybody.

Always when I watch TG and my boyfriend sits down and to watch for a few seconds and Zach comes on, he immediately leaves and says how annoying Zach is, and he doesn't even watch TG. 

I like him way better when he isn't trying to be funny at all, and is just being himself. I loved his Candid Competition series, but lately he is just.... not nice to watch. Not even entertaining. Sorry for everybody who got hurt by this comment, I am not trying to be mean as I said, but this whole Zach thing is becoming a problem for me."

He went way down on the popularity-scale for me, he is not even on it right now honestly. Even shortly before the whole quarantine I have started to find him cringy and annoying. I can't even understand what Maggy (Maggie?) is seeing in him. 

The last episode with the boxing was the first episode in a long while that I didn't find him annoying. And I realized that I liked him more, because he actually tried for once. Usually he knows he will lose in things, so he intentionally fucks up to seem funny and cute or whatever. But I take him so much more seriously when he actually tries."

BPD,foq2ju3,t3_g8i23f,1587980657.0,"I grew up with a narcissistic mother, a father who enabled her, but they fought every day it felt like. There was always screaming, accusations, outbursts, us kids being dragged into their fights. Mother slapped both me and my brother a lot, it became instinct for her to hit us as soon as we did something she didn't like, or said something or whatever.

She is still very jealous of everybody. She exhibits the same kind of separation anxiety that I do with my boyfriend, and it made me fear for a while that I would become narcissistic as well, but we are so different.

My dad wasn't allowed to help me with stuff most of the time. He couldn't even make me tea when I was sick. He wasn't allowed to drive me to places once I became a ""young woman"". I noticed that just now. Maybe she was that crazy jealous that she feared that we would do something sexual if she wasn't there?? Jesus. 

She once cried out that dad loves me more than her, something I had suspected she felt for a long time, but it hurt when she finally said it.

I won't ever get kids, because I'm afraid that I will become as jealous of their relationship with their dad as my mom was."

He seems to has lost touch with the world around him, so I can't even have a decent conversation with him without feeling like he isn't even listening or doesn't understand where I'm coming from.

I used to love him, but now I am more or less indifferent towards both of them, well except for when they behave like shit, then obviously I'm still effected. But if I'm truly honest, I don't know if I would even cry if they would die right this second."

The forth was nice, but I ended it prematurely, and was back to being suicidal 3 days later, but I was too scared to go back with the tail between my legs.

EDAnonymous,fomiuue,t3_g81utf,1587891653.0,"I used to be underweight all my life, until I was 20 when I met my boyfriend. I think it was other stuff as well, like suddenly having money and drinking/eating a lot. At like 26 I lost 66 lbs in 6 months by only eating 500 calories once a day, every day. It felt good that people noticed and asked me how I lost so much weight. Then I started a new job at a hotel where ny job was (is) to take care of the breakfast buffé, so I had to eat breakfast to not be weird, people would start asking questions. And that brought me down a hole of fast food, snacks, and over eating.

I have in 3 years gained 22 lbs again, during that time I had one or two periods where I restricted to lose weight. Ugh. It's a never ending circle. Sorry what was the question?

Oh yeah, YES! I feel better when I restrict and work out and think about food, cause the alternative is mindless eating and clothes not fitting, and it also helps me with *having something to do\~* As I suffer from chronic boredom, and food helps/makes it worse."
