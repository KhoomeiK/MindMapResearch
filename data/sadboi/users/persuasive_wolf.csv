First thing, masturbation is normal to all especially teenagers. Problem is it's unusual for women to do it naturally. And to be caught by parents is really painful to see.

Important thing right now is to educate the kids about sex. It's All about education. M might be talking online with different guys who could have influenced her to do things like that. 

In this age, technology has gone so far that meeting a stranger is one click away from your phone with internet access.

Your husband's reaction is maybe because he was so shocked of the incident. But if nothing changed after talking to him, there's really a problem.
