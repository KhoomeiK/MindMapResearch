trashy,fq8v467,t1_fq88h64,1589176401.0,"> Why does a miscarriage fuck people up in the head but not aborting a baby at the same level of development?

I mean, first of all, a miscarriage isn‚Äôt a choice. It happens spontaneously in about 15% of known pregnancies. 

I think you are confusing wanted pregnancies with unwanted pregnancies. Individual people have individual opinions. A relief for one is another‚Äôs worst nightmare; women aren‚Äôt a homogenous blob with the same thoughts, desires, and beliefs. Pregnancy/infant loss is devastating because generally if you‚Äôre past the first trimester, you‚Äôre ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù to announce the pregnancy, start picking names, and preparing for the baby to come. They love the baby already, who is already considered a family member, a niece or nephew, a little sibling, maybe the first grand baby. Maybe there‚Äôs been a baby shower. And now instead of bringing home their son or daughter, they get to explain the loss. 

It‚Äôs different for everyone.

And not everyone can get pregnant over and over again, and some people spend $100,000 to have that miscarriage (IVF). People sometimes spend years trying to conceive. 

Empathy dude."

We‚Äôre still open, but only until we run out of cleaning supplies. My HR dept sent an email with all available CA state resources for unemployment/disability to all staff and everyone has been encouraged to take this very seriously and avoid the office unless absolutely necessary. Many parents and staff have cancelled due to concerns and we‚Äôre not counting against them or expecting makeup plans right now. 

Please research your state resources. By no means should your company put you in potential harm‚Äôs way."
