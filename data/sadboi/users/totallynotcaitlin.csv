trashy,fq8v467,t1_fq88h64,1589176401.0,"> Why does a miscarriage fuck people up in the head but not aborting a baby at the same level of development?

I mean, first of all, a miscarriage isn’t a choice. It happens spontaneously in about 15% of known pregnancies. 

I think you are confusing wanted pregnancies with unwanted pregnancies. Individual people have individual opinions. A relief for one is another’s worst nightmare; women aren’t a homogenous blob with the same thoughts, desires, and beliefs. Pregnancy/infant loss is devastating because generally if you’re past the first trimester, you’re “in the clear” to announce the pregnancy, start picking names, and preparing for the baby to come. They love the baby already, who is already considered a family member, a niece or nephew, a little sibling, maybe the first grand baby. Maybe there’s been a baby shower. And now instead of bringing home their son or daughter, they get to explain the loss. 

It’s different for everyone.

And not everyone can get pregnant over and over again, and some people spend $100,000 to have that miscarriage (IVF). People sometimes spend years trying to conceive. 

Empathy dude."

The sad fact is that most agencies can’t afford to pay people if sufficient revenue isn’t coming in. FT supervisors at the last agency I was at were just made hourly; everyone is pissed but we lost 50% of our billable hours due to school closures from COVID. 

Technically, you no longer work for the agency and they can’t control what you do as a non-employee. 

The issue is that boundary-crossing is an enormous problem and it happens all the time, unintentionally. Say goodbye, but professionally decline to give any reasons. Just say that you wish things could have gone differently and that given the choice you’d still be with those families. It’s a tough time for everyone right now. 

What you want to avoid is burdening those families with YOUR needs. They will naturally worry about you - do not give them any reason to worry about you, as our clients have enough problems as it is. As a care provider, it’s extremely unprofessional to complain to former clients about an agency. Never throw ANYone under the bus.
