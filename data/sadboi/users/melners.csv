It was also frustrating, because these weren’t the characters *I* cared about. (I generally don’t care for AUs in any series because of this.) I like Papyrus, and to finish the game adoring his characterization, the AUs were... something else, lol. 

Now I’ve come to enjoy Underswap (and I kind of tolerate Underfell but only if there’s a bit of humour, nothing too serious or angsty), but I could honestly care less about any of the rest.

AskReddit,eviee6z,t3_cjsq0b,1564541280.0,"90% of my neighbours in our apartment complex are seniors- my husband and I are the only tenants under 35. When people leave these apartments, it’s only one of two ways: they either move to assisted living, or... well, they pass away.  No joke: many times in the past three years we have seen an ambulance pull into the parking lot, and the next day the flag out front would be at half mast. So there are potentially many restless spirits in the area.

Things will constantly disappear or move; there are a lot of noises that you can’t quite place where they came from; I feel like I will sometimes catch motion out of the corner of my eye; and we’ll sometimes hear a woman humming or a muffled conversation in the middle of our living room (this could potentially be my next door neighbour, but she is almost always at her boyfriend’s so her apartment is usually empty- and our living room doesn’t touch any of her walls).

A lot of the events can be easily explained (like we were tired, or our eyes played tricks on us in the dark), but some I just can’t find a logical explanation for them. Like in the middle of the day when we both VERY clearly hear something fall over in the cupboard or a closet, and we open it up and absolutely nothing has been moved. And no one is out in the hall.

The fact that all of this has been happening consistently to both me AND my husband has made me believe, but the two two incidents that converted me happened when I was home alone. I was fast asleep, and was suddenly woken by a hand grabbing my shoulder and a woman hovering over the bed, screaming in my face. Her face was contorted and skeletal, and her hair was billowing wildly behind her.

The second incident is honestly the one that rattled me more. As I was laying in bed one night, I felt this *presence* in the room. I can’t even describe it. It was like she was trying to speak through me. In this presence, I felt that she used to live in another apartment and died there, but she was drawn to our place because her friend used to live here and they would visit all the time. She didn’t hate us, she was just an old religious woman and didn’t really approve of two borderline atheists living here.

We have actually had a minister bless the place twice, and both times afterwards I felt a noticeable calmness in the apartment, like a weight off my chest. There’s still a few inexplicable thumps here and there, but for the most part she seems to have chilled out. We’re planning on moving soon so that might have made her happy. But I did read in another comment that paranormal activity can cause insomnia... and hey guess what both my husband and I have been dealing with for the past three years? Woohoo."
AskReddit,eua5dxv,t3_cfd2w0,1563601800.0,"My friend K told me about the last time she and a group of her friends went to a local all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. The group was all poor, starving students with eyes far bigger than their stomachs, and at the end of their meal there was a LOT of food still left on the table, and they’re freaking out a bit because they have to pay for any leftover food. 

As they’re discussing what they should do, K notices one girl leave for the washroom. When she didn’t come back to the table right away, another girl left to check on her. After a few more minutes, K got a frantic text from girl #2 asking her to come to the washroom. Apparently girl #1 tried flushing the remaining sushi down the toilet, where it clogged and began to overflow onto the floor. 

...And that’s why our sushi restaurant has a “Please do not flush food” sign in the ladies washroom. I’ll have to go there some time to see if it’s still there."
