She has what she has called her dream job. Travels and sees the world‚Äîis in the middle of the ocean right now which most people never see‚Äîgets all of this incredible luxury, free wifi, a balcony... its just like... Please trade me? Please? 

I get it and I am with you‚Äîgoing to work is like going to war, and putting in all the energy to make it through that day to day offers nothing but exhaustion and delay towards actually, even in a small way, getting better. 

Even as the finances suffer right now, I have had improvements on my mood chart. I have gone on my first leisure walk in nearly two years. It is calming to me that everyone is tucked away in their places. 

I dont do social media at all, its a trigger for me, so I am definitely and thankfully missing out on almost all of this bullshit. Maybe but probably not, this is a way to awaken people of just how bad it must be for someone to relish and enjoy times like this which they define as ‚Äúhorrific‚Äù for their own experience of it. Maybe it will give them better understanding and ability to be compassionate. Either way I just kinda stay in my lane and try not to give a fuck. Meds help."

She is not too far off base in that there are many nuances and extremely contrasting perspectives state by state. 

That said, the default lack of cohesion already existing here, in addition to pre-existing problems of impoverishment, make it difficult to make a direct comparison to the US as a whole. Definitely I can say that the federal government was not prepared for something of this nature whatsoever and is publicly flailing in its own incompetence. Our haves and have-nots gap remains enormous, and over a massive landscape, frankly people would starve well before COVID overtook. It is a glum juxtaposition to the ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù identity.
