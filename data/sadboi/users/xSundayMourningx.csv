All these ppl posting comments trying to stop you from killing yourself - it's bc ppl care. And even if you don't know these ppl personally, they still don't want to see you hurt yourself. You reached out. That's shows you're looking for another way out of this that doesn't involve ending your life. Keep reaching out, keep searching... You sound like a good human being, just with some bad desires. Those desires don't have to define you. You can fight them. And you can win. You obviously have support.

Always told her that if she ever tried to leave that he WOULD find her, and he WOULD kill he, not just put her in the hospital like the other times. He was a sociopath. He felt no physical pain himself (I saw him cut his thumb off with an axe and then thrust it in my face while laughing, afterwards getting a sewing needle and thread to reattach it). Not only did he not feel pain, but he had no qualms abt causing pain to others, in any way he could. My mum believed with all her heart that he would indeed find her and had no doubts whatsoever that he would definitely kill her (and ""hide her body where she would *never* be found"" That's a direct quote from my father). ""That's just the sort of person he was"", my mum would say. But that's not what frightened her. It's what he would do to us kids when he found us that frightened her into staying (there were 4 of us). As long as he wasnt physically hurting the children, she said to herself, she would stay. But unbeknownst to her, he *did* hurt us children. The only reason she got away is bc my older sister (16 at the time) went to the guidance counselor (thinking they had a thing like a patient/doctor confidentiality agreement) and told the counselor abt how our father had raped her. There, of course, is no ""confidentiality"" when a child is being abused. The cops showed up at our house that very day and took him away. THAT is how my mum got out. 
The whole ""there's ALWAYS a way out"" quite angers me. EVERY situation is different. Every abuse is different. Some ways out are surprisingly quite easily. But others are so difficult to see, let alone actually pull off, are a *massive* majority of them. And then you have the situations where, at least for the time being, getting out actually *is* impossible."

And so many ppl have it SO MUCH WORSE! I mean, the *worst* he's ever done to me physically in ten yrs is push me down a time or two, picked me up once by my shirt and threw my across the room - he's a big guy 6'2, 250 lbs..I'm 5'5 130 lbs (which he did immediately offer to help me up, which I declined), choked me maybe somewhere between half a dozen and a dozen times (one time so bad I cd hardly talk for days), gave me a VERY SMALL black eye (just on the corner which I easily covered up w/ ""smeared"" eyeliner) but just once... pushed me put of the vehicles and left me to walk a few miles home (does that one even count as ""physical""? Idk actually ... 
   That's more or less for the physical part of it I think. Anything else kinda borders on physical and mental.... But really it's the mental abuse that the disrespect that hurts the most. On top of that he's impotent and we haven't slept together in *eight* *years*. And he's only ""pleasures me"" (orally) between 2 - 3 times a year. About 4 months ago I remember getting irritated bc it had been abt 3 months since he'd done anything. I bring it up nicely at first. Then after a few weeks of that I start to get irritated so I downright start asking for it. Then abt a cple weeks after asking for it I just straight up get mad bc I'm so sexually frustrated and angry that he cares so little abt *my* sexual desires!!! So then after I get mad, he waits AT LEAST one or two months after that. So it's been a minimum of 7 no that since he has satisfied me. And for those of you that say ""get a toy"", I get what you're saying, but that shdnt be my job! HE had be the one pleasuring me! That's *my* view on it! One time he got off this medication he takes and was always be get an erection for two weeks. During those two weeks I had no desire for him bc, I felt like ""he shdnt only show an interest in intimacy when HE can ""get it up""! It's not all up him! It shd be abt US! And he had the gall to say to me ""well if you aren't sexually interested in me then maybe we should break up and I can find someone who *is* sexually attracted to me!"" Two weeks. I said for two weeks after he had said no for (at that point probably abt 5 yrs I think). 
I'm not going to get into the real mental or emotional bc I have made this FAR long enough, lol... Maybe another time.

I mean, if I'm camping or something bc I'm hiding from the cops and living in the woods and I'm up against a bear - I will hurt that thing if given the chance. I've seen a few ppl eaten alive by bears (only in pics). Heard their phone calls as they called for help. I do NOT want to go that way. Trust me - it is HORRIFIC and I'd bet my life HORRIFICLY PAINFUL EVERY SECOND OF IT WHICH MUST FEEL LIKE HOURS!!! Nor would I ever hurt a child. If there's a child that accidentally witnessed a crime bc I got careless and didn't know it was there, I would then take it and love it as my very own, training it in the new ""family business"". See? I'd only hurt the nasty men and women that deserve it. My own judging of course. I'll be a vigilante serial killer. Like the men in... Afghanistan? India? I'll have to check up the actual details, but those *GROTESQUE* *SOUL-LESS* men who throw acid in the face of their wife or lover or just whatever woman they do it to; forever destroying this poor woman's self esteem, her trust, her ability to find love again I'mvery easily when half of your face is gone, not to mention the actual *INTENSE* *PAIN* and these men so NO JUSTICE!!! Or woman like Kaycee Anthony who *obviously* murdered her sweet lovely toddler Kaylee and walked free. Writing books and becoming a photographer. Sickening.
    Wow, the more I write, the less obvious this becomes that I was joking.... I'd better stop now before anyone starts to believe this. 
Trust me, I'm such a loser, I cdnt even be a serial killer. I'd be caught my first attempt. And it would be an ""attempt"" bc I would fail at it. That is my lot in life.

I have matured greatly since then. My new (not ""new"" as we've been together for years now, but you know what I mean) boyfriend simply has to put up with it. No cards, no gifts, just the joy of my laughing every time it happens."

And you're right, if it were someone else, I would never shame them for what happened, nor would I want them to shame or guilt themself. I would do everything I could to try to make her feel better.

To anyone reading this, if you do get a doctor who treats you the way mine treated me, so unemotional and straight out cold, I hope you get up and find yourself a new doctor! This doctor didn't deserve the money spent or anything else. If I was in my right frame of mind..... Well, if I was in my right frame of mind a lot of things would be different. Just, if you're able to, choose a doctor that treats you well and takes your feelings into consideration. An abortion is a huge decision that affects some women for life. It should *never* be done so callously!!!"

MorbidReality,fhyxhuu,t1_fhyrsfn,1581986032.0,"I was seeing someone some years back. I became pregnant. He didn't want to talk abt it the first few weeks we found out. Then he just started driving me to an abortion clinic. He made appts for me to have an abortion and drove me to the clinic without my knowing abt it multiple times. I was stupid and NOT in a position in my life to take care of a child on my own (I'd barely be able to do it with a partner at that time of my life - I was in a BAD SPOT)! I finally ended up going inside the clinic one of these times. I was the only patient in there crying. I was crying so hard the nurse didn't want to go through with it. But the Dr of course didn't care. He did an ultrasound before hand and I asked if I could have it, and cd at least show the father before we ""went through with the operation"". Very rudely and unemotionally he said, ""No. You're in here. You go through with it now or you leave"". As I cried harder, they gave me some medication and the next thing I remember is waking up, the nurse walking me out of the ""surgery room"" bc I cdnt walk on my own bc of whatever they gave me, and I was still crying. I never cared what other women did, but I always felt abortion wasn't for me. I named the baby. I named her Anastasia Ruby (I THINK it was a female, but I cd be wrong). It was simply my way of letting the baby know that I'm so terribly sorry, and even if I was a terrible mother, I still loved her."

SuicideWatch,fhwo29c,t3_f4wkn5,1581922527.0,"If you spend time looking up pictures of suicides, it may no longer seem so beautiful to you. I have a morbid curiosity with death. I have seen thousands of pictures of all sorts of death. I have seen MANY suicides. And I'd say 1 out of *hundreds* looks the way you described. You poop yourself when you die, for one. As well as pee yourself. So that's not very beautiful. Depending on when you're found, you bloat (which is DISGUSTING!!!) Sometimes your eyes look like they're about to pop right out of their sockets. That's one ugly look, let me tell you! Maggots will fill ALL your orifices (mouth, nostrils ear). If you're talking abt talking pills, you'll be found with vomit all over you. So vomit, urine and feces, bugs.... sounds lovely. The weather when you die depends a lot on what your body will look like when found as well. Suicide may *sound* beautiful. But to the ppl who find you, and the ones who have to clean you and your room up, it is anything but beautiful! 
In fact, I've often thought that if these ppl cd see what they would have looked like when they were found, they may not have committed suicide in the first place."
death,fhwn5jc,t1_fhwepjm,1581921522.0,"I did not cope well, to be honest. I went into a deep depression. Tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and drugs. Anything to take away that deep black void that she left behind. I lost everything in that depression. My home. My cars. My license (bc of the drugs, I started having seizures, and when you go to the e.r. for a seizure they contact the DMV and you lose your license for a number of years)... My career. Ultimately lost my husband bc of it. Almost lost my sanity. Thought many times abt taking my own life. Losing my sister more or less made me lose my life as I knew it. But I didn't know what else to do. I cdn't stop crying. Curling up in a fetal position and just doing nothing all day but BAWLING! Every breath I took felt like my insides were squeezing my already broken heart, and made it feel as though my heart was breaking  a little bit more with every breath I took. So I literally cdnt even breathe w/out being in pain. We were so close, and I always said, ""If anything ever happened to Sarah, Idk what I wd do"". And when it happened, I really didn't know what to do. And bc of that, I ended up allowing my life to be destroyed. You can't let that happen to yourself. Bc believe me, once you hit rock bottom like I did, it can take a lifetime to drag yourself back out of that hole you dug yourself in! Cry, mourn, feel your feelings, but don't dwell on them. Don't forget that YOU are still here. And ppl love you. Spend time with those ppl. The ones who knew her (family) as well as the ones who didn't (the ones who didn't know her won't be in mourning, so it may be easier to smile or laugh around these ppl in the beginning). Try to distract yourself. Lose yourself in a hobby. It is VERY EASY to lose yourself in a loved ones death, but as I said, it is NOT EASY to get yourself back! Cry, scream, do whatever you need to do. But MAKE YOURSELF get out of bed and do something to try to distract your mind! If you need, I'll give you my number and just listen when you need someone to vent to, someone to just yell at or to just listen to you cry or to hear stories about her. DONT DO WHAT I DID!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!"

And those ppl you'll have to learn to ignore (or sometimes learn from - sometimes they may actually give you good advice). Other ppl however, will love it. If I had a penny to my name I'd offer to buy it right here and now.

As I said though, otherwise I'd be offering to buy your work. Also, you'll never know until you try. And keep trying. Maybe you put a few pieces out there and get nothing.
