I was at an apartment complex visiting a friend of mine, and as I was walking back to my car I saw my ex's mom and she ran up to me saying hello and hugging me. My ex and I had been broken up for almost 3 years at this point and I hadn't seen her since. (The family lived in a different state). Not far behind her was his dad and my ex. His parents were chatting with me for about 5 min while my ex and I all stood there kind of awkwardly. But then his parents started INSISTING I stay for dinner. My ex and I tried to politely decline and end the convo but his parents were not taking no for an answer. So I obliged and went inside intending to stay for just a few minutes but when I walked in, I  quickly realized this is his NEW GIRLFRIEND'S apartment. She was super nice but just sort of sat quietly in the corner while my ex's parents laughed about the funny stories we all shared during the relationship. My ex, his gf and I were all suuuper uncomfortable so I faked a phone call and ""had to go"". I felt so bad for his new gf.

Fast forward about two months later, I bump into her again and she insists I come have drinks with them at his new place. It seemed weird to me but I said okay and we all had a great time. But then she started trying to move things to the bedroom and that was just a can of worms I didn't want to open so I left. They eventually broke up about a year later and he and I are good friends that laugh about it all.

TL;DR- Ex's parents insisted I join them for dinner, turns out it was at his new GF's place. Super awkward. Then the GF tried to rope me into a 3 way with them 2 months later."

To clarify, I'm not discouraging people from fighting back, but asking people to understand that sometimes, it just doesn't work like that. Sometimes for no reason at all, we just disassociate and forget our capabilities. 
I always still think I should've fought harder, hell, I had a loaded gun under my bed and didn't even think about it. I'm a trained military officer. I've fought off other people for friends in this situation...But when it happened, and I said no, when I hit and kicked and realized it wasn't stopping him, I froze and thought I could trick myself into believing it was okay. And I will *always* blame myself for thinking that. For not fighting back harder, for not being clearer, and I am ashamed at how weak I was. I want to think I'd never ""let"" that happen to me again knowing what I know now. But I'm still so afraid that I wouldn't be the badass I've tried to build myself up to be. I've always stepped in for others, never afraid to get punched back or hurt, but when it comes to protecting myself...I still have a lot to work on.

Fighting back doesn't always work. Continuing to say no, or resisting more might just make them angry/more physical and it's not a chance you're currently willing to take. 
Freezing, acquiescing, and forced consent are NOT consent, and it's not weak, it's unfortunately sometimes your best shot at minimizing physical injury during something so traumatic and jarring.
