BPD,f2k50t8,t1_f2jxoik,1570281448.0,"Thanks I was trying to write this lol 💕
The approach I’ve taken in my 4yr relationship is the Buddhist philosophy of “love without attachment”. I love my partner & he loves me but we have the understanding that neither of us owns each other & what each of us needs & chooses in life is up to ourselves to fulfill but with the support of the other.
It’s a struggle at times bc I know I can be very codependent one moment & then off with no word doing my own thing the next. He listens without judgement & responds if I need him. I don’t expect him to read my mind or be a knight in shining armour. Tbh if anyone is going to be my knight in shining armour it’s me"

BPD,eyyzbg7,t3_czkxpb,1567605804.0,"I’m not working either, I’m working on an application to Uni but not feeling like I’m ready to work yet. 
I watch lots of documentaries, news & research stuff I’m interested in, potter in the garden, walk, do housework, lots of video games.
I also do things I’ve always wanted to like painting & writing. I find creative work is a good outlet & a way to process stuff.
I don’t socialise much & do all these things alone which suits me fine. 
Be patient with yourself, do things to look after future you & stuff that you feel accomplished by. It doesn’t matter how small."

BPD,etr9zo5,t3_cd3h6x,1563116051.0,"Agree. The times I’ve been out of control & manic like it’s been because of hopelessness. I don’t place any value on objects or money, don’t believe in the future or have care for myself. I want to feel good even if it’s just for a bit & then use the consequence to reinforce the belief I’m a shit human and should be punished."
BPD,eto6zl1,t3_ccnzof,1563016911.0,It’s not intentional. She still needs to be told that it’s not appropriate to tell other people’s secrets. Boundaries are important and she needs to know. I tend to overshare a lot and say things that make people uncomfortable and sometimes I just don’t know when I’ve crossed the line.
mentalhealth,ere6wjx,t3_c1n04q,1560775674.0,"You are not your illness. Would you judge or shame someone for a physical reaction during an epileptic seizure or if someone was behaving strangely & then found out they had a brain tumour? No shame in being sick, remember you are awesome too"
BPD,epzb9lb,t3_bwp7g9,1559662230.0,Your therapist will help teach you how. It’s about finding what works for you. I find it a struggle at times but be patient and kind to yourself.
BPD,epvuo9u,t3_bw6hgj,1559552081.0,Love this! Thank you.
