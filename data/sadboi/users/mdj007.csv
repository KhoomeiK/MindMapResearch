We are looking for and more similar to the beginning of prewar nazi Germany. Before you argue against. Take a look. It wasn’t the hateful evil thing that goes bump on the night until after full on war started and Jewish extermination camps. Most Germans had no clue. Or like many Americans they did but didn’t know or were too lazy to do anything about it. Everyone was caught up in their own crap. I mean I’m sitting here and have no clue what to do about it. I mean clearly I can just drive there and say “hey guys ya know you shouldn’t do that” republicans that say less government most the time. It just blows my mind how it seems the entire Republican Party turns a blind eyes to anything that goes against the cultish behavior. Our political parties are not cults if our own does stuff wrong call them on it.

lupus,fn27a1l,t1_fn0uq50,1586579835.0,"Originally chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly neuropathy secondary to lupus. Later we came to find out it was Guillain-Barré. Originally lupus at 17 then neuro at 19. My doctor thought I was just drug seeking. So basically said F off. Well after so much pain for a month I ended up in a psych ward. They did something called a nerve conduction study and figured something was wrong in one day. It’s all about the docs u have in ur side. The test basically sends electrical signals from my hip to my ankle. It’s suppose to take a certain time for the signal to travel between the two points. If it takes longer than that it means in my case there was scar tissue Bc they had been attacked by my body. 
At that point I got a new rheumatologist who is literally the reason I’m alive today. If ur in the Midwest area he is amazing. 

For years it was simply classes idiopathic peripheral neuropathy kinda a catch all for idk what it is. Then the more specific one. Which if it was that it should have gotten progressively worse. I took 300 mg oxycodone daily for years, then also got a spinal cord stimulator. Keeping in mind Even with all those drugs every day was a struggle. Then 2 years ago they started feeling better, they got better. I got off the painkillers. Rn they hurt daily but I can endure it. Since it got better they diagnosis was switched to Guillain-Barré. If ur having issues I would suggest u r adamant about getting the test done there is literally no reason not to. It is kinda painful tho. When I was younger I was constantly gas lighted by doctors telling me I’m basically just being a wimp about my lupus. I finished out my senior year of hs football taking pain meds to play. I’m stupid but not a wimp. Doctors think they know everything arrogant and we r just idiots I learned all I could. Already having a background in science def helped. But my doc know admits he only knows so much. I bring new research and new med suggestions to him, he looks a researches it and more times than not if I wanna try something new he is down for it. That is what makes him an amazing doctor"
