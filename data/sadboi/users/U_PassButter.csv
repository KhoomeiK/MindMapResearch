I might just be the human equivalent of a pissed off corgi. But people fucking suck and I hate the hypocrisy and the double standards. I will go as rouge as I need to, regardless of the cosequences.

I agree with you 100%  Its all a cash grab. They say it's ""for society"" or to ""help"" but it's not. If that were the case, there would be way more support. People shouldn't immediately become a number. I'm 100% for ""safe usage sites"". Some people do just like to get high! And that's okay! There are so many ""rich people drugs"" that people are super okay with. Theres is so much stigma and people pick and choose, and judge people based, and decide who they are because of their drug of choice."
heroin,fnjdsl2,t1_fnjcd4s,1586996941.0,"Thanks I appreciate that. I try my best. I've only worked with men in addiction, so I (28F) dont know if being a woman has any factors in it? But, even with my female colleagues I've seen the same ""I know what's best"" attitude. I just dont understand. Most of my guys have been in prison as well. I try to address mental health issues beyond addiction. And if someone isnt ready to stop using, that okay with me. I just try to help them understand themselves more. I really like to help my guys find ways to love themselves, despite what society says. Despite where they are in recovery. And despite whether they are even ready for that journey. I'm focusing on teaching my guys about what their rights are as ""patients"" and how to take a stance in their own life. I dont care what their psychiatrist say. No one knows you better than you. And the justice system is FUCKED. I can't imagine how hard it must be to begin self-forgiveness when the justice system and society never let you forget. Theres no reason someone should get jail time or be on parole for 2years for having ONE dirty piss test."
