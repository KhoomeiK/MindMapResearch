Edmonton,foh2xez,t3_g6a9oy,1587759920.0,"Edmonton is a wonderful city with a tonne of outdoor activities to enjoy! Winter can definitely take some getting used to, but I would recommend renting a fat bike in the winter and take to the single track! We also have a lot of cross country skiing tracks, skating rinks, and winter festivals (like Flying Canoe Volange!). All equipment for activities can be rented, so it's easy to try something new :) 


If you like outdoor activities I would also recommend the Edmonton Outdoor Club who usually have weekly hikes (except recently due to COVID). They are wonderful people who know so many trails in Edmonton to enjoy. 


Both Jasper and Banff are about a 4 hour drive away, pretty reasonable for a weekend mountain trip. And in between is Clearwater County which is less touristy but some great hiking trails and views!  


Food scene is awesome here though depending on where you are from it might not compare. I recommend a triage of restaurants by the same owner: Pip, The Next Act, and MEAT. A surprising amount of good mexican food too (I recommend El Mariachi on 124 st). We don't have a tonne of breweries but each brewery is pretty fantastic (Omen Brewing is one of my favourites). 


Overall I hope you enjoy your new life here!"

After I switched to all purpose unbleached and I haven't noticed any issues with the flours used :) 

And for the sourdough recipe I've been obsessively watching [this YouTube video from Pro Home Cooks](https://youtu.be/BJEHsvW2J6M). He just explains everything so well and makes it easy to follow!"
Sourdough,fm4ocxp,t3_ft2nk5,1585757831.0,"So the first four days are usually bacteria and after that yeast builds up, so it's common to see your starter go ""flat"" for a bit. I'd wait a few days before making any changes - I waited until day 10 before I changed to spring water which really helped (my city tap water has chloramines in it)"

Edmonton,fk92ovj,t3_fg862m,1583967504.0,"Everywhere lol. Edmonton is a great place to do some xc skiing!! Some are recommending Strathcona Wilderness Centre but I personally love North Cooking Lake which is a little further east than the SWC. 

Also out of in-city skiing I personally prefer goldbar and Capilano park! Tonnes of hills but also a lot of easy track if you don't want to go too hard. 


The city of Edmonton website also tracks when they groom trails and what conditions they're in: https://www.edmonton.ca/activities_parks_recreation/cross-country-skiing.aspx"

Edmonton,feoyema,t3_eq3n1i,1579308085.0," [Update:](https://i.imgur.com/wVSSvkW.jpg) as of 10am there was an accident between the two cars at the top. About 30 minutes later another car slid in to them. And then over the course of a couple hours a few cars got stuck in the snow bank trying to avoid the collision like the one shown here.

It was a wild ride! We called 311 but no tow trucks or police ever came to the scene, and the owners left the cars abandoned around 3pm"
personalfinance,fbkk8hq,t3_edi8wr,1576951642.0,"My dad moved from labour in the telecom industry and he moved towards project management when he wanted an office job. If he wants to stay in the same industry or even back to electrical, I would advise him getting a project management course (or estimator if he really doesn't want to deal with people) at your local technical school. 

Also, I find that with those jobs he doesn't need to necessarily tone down his ""rough around the edges"" personality. A lot of those places you deal with your own workers or others in the industry, so they have the same personality"
depression,fbkg4g5,t3_edpkii,1576949794.0,"I thought I was the only one!!

television,f9m5stc,t1_f9e87vg,1575442717.0,"I don't necessarily agree with this. Yes, I do believe that consumers should be responsible to make sure the goods they buy are safe, but I do think that goods should be safe to purchase in the first place. 


Lightning strikes are uncontrollable events, there isn't someone who can change the outcome of people dying in those tragedies. Ikea can change theirs. In the episode they talk about how dressers can be made safer, so it's not like it's impossible to make something safe for children - corporations are just ignoring those standards. 


In your example you use car fatalities, but in those instances safety measures are enacted in attempt to reduce those accidents. Slower speed limits in school zones, flashing pedestrian lights installed , etc. People are making changes to make things safer. And I think it's any corporations responsibility to do that too."
AskReddit,f8xf5ou,t3_e2q8ia,1574916867.0,"Bikes. I somehow went from 1 shitty Walmart bike for commuting to owning a fatbike, a commuter, and a mountain bike. 2/3 of those are worth over 3,000. My bikes are more expensive than my car lol.  And then there's the bike clothes, helmets, pedals, etc. 
Owning bikes is almost an addiction, once you have one great bike you need more for every activity. I'd say the activities you get out of it are well worth the cost, though!"
