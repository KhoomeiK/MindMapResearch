depression,fiq0jrq,t1_fhpeqv5,1582630680.0,"Yes, it is. But the modern man is a p*ssy, I guess. 

People in the dark ages got half of their faces cut off with a rusty sword by a robber who was too stupid to realize that his victim is poor as well, but they moved on. This guy is crying like a little girl because he wants a hug. So give me a f*cking break."
depression,fip89jr,t3_f8q6pt,1582600236.0,"Two other things that I recommend is the YouTube channel ""Harald Baldr"" (I cant really explain how, but his videos really help me) and going out in nature."
lonely,fi2g2c3,t3_f5wljl,1582078933.0,"I'm a 20 year old man and I've spent the past few years mostly alone. I don't care. I can't deal with people and I won't force myself to. I feel happy alone. 

I am attractive and, I guess, mysterious, since I am confident AND a loner, so many people want to talk to me, be friends with me or date me, but I just can't. I know there's something wrong with me, but I have accepted who I am."
depression,fhwv5qi,t3_f51oky,1581931841.0,"I feel you. I'm in the same situation. I don't want to hurt my family. But I've recently found something to look forward to, something that gave me a reason to live. 

I found a YouTube channel that really helps me with my depression. Harald Baldr. He makes videos of his travels. For some reason the interactions he has with people and the beautiful places he visits and just his personality alone make me feel better. Aside from that, you see how very poor people live in other countries and how happy most of them are despite the situation they're in.
Through his channel I found a dream, something that I can look forward to: traveling. 

You should really check his channel out. Just give it a chance."

TrueOffMyChest,ffyow6d,t3_evt405,1580351575.0,"I understand how you feel and I feel sorry for you, but one day you will understand why men are not and should not be too emotional. Thousands, maybe millions of years of brutal battles with animals and other men do that to you. In war, you have to stay somewhat calm and clearheaded or you and your family are more likely to die. You can't feel sorry for yourself in such a situation. 

I recommend ""Meditations"" by Marcus Aurelius and ""Daily Stoic"". It'll help you no matter what you're going through."

quotes,ffu9jb4,t3_dg9t1e,1580237327.0,"As someone with crippling social anxiety and other issues I find this movie very... comforting. I can relate to the Joker on some level. I'm not as delusional as him and I understand why people barely tolerate me, but I am a loner that nobody cares about. Not even my own parents. I literally tell them what how I feel on how much I suffer because of my mental illnesses, but they just pretend not to hear anything or just brush it off. And making friends is impossible for people with real social anxiety, so I know how soul crushing loneliness can be."

Trufemcels,fea8kwz,t3_ekn4ee,1578945640.0,"I'm new to reddit, but I'm pretty sure I'll get blocked after this:
I'm what people would call a mentalcel. I am good looking (I get a lot of attention from girls), but I have crippling social anxiety (I can barely talk to people, often risk being rude because I prefer that to voice breaks) and I don't feel like one of the ""normal people"", even though everyone assumes that because of the way I look. All I want is to be able to socialize, to have a girl that loves me for who I am, to be happy with her. Aside from all the negative things, my psychological problems have also saved me from being shallow. I know it is hard, but don't give up on all men."
