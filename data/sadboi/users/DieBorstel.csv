bipolar,feg4cjx,t3_eoygyc,1579076339.0,"I guess a good means of seeing whether or not you're manic is analysing your sleep. If your thoughts are constantly keeping you up and you get 0 or close to 0 sleep you're probably manic and should immediately contact your psychiatrist.

If during the day you feel so happy that literally everything has a positive connotation and your thoughts keep on racing and distracting you from whatever you're doing, you're probably manic.

Just remind yourself that being happy or overly happy can still happen and that we're inclined to be more happy/excited, so don't worry too much. It just needs to be contained.

I remember that in a book I read on bipolar that there's some kind of checklist you can go trough to determine if you're manic! Maybe check that out.

Plus if you don't forget your meds and don't use alcohol or durgs excessively your chances of getting manic will be smaller, but this also depends on whether or not you've found your correct 'med-cocktail'"

The only person in my life with who I could share thoughts and feelings about bipolar is my mother.
Sadly I lost her to this disease. Way before I was diagnosed (+- 5 years). She escaped from the hospital and committed suicide. Since I've gone through the entire bipolar cycle I feel like I know her better than ever. She must've felt so bad and such a burden on me and my family that she decided we would be better of without her. 
She was an amazing person, I owe her so much. And If I ever have a daughter she's gonna get her name.

Luckily this community is a great place to hop on now and then to feel less alone in all this.

bipolar,f8sa602,t1_f8rz2b5,1574774918.0,"I wholeheartedly agree that this isn't a blessing. 
I've gotta admit. I've been stable for a while now, and I do feel like I have this little backpack of extra energy most days to the point that I'm constantly being active. Be it in my mind or some tangible activity.
After a good month of living life with an insanely full schedule combined with a 9 to 5 job I did already hit a wall. 
Luckily some extra sleep during the weekend solved this.

So one might see this extra supply of energy a blessing, and sometimes it does feel like it is. 
I guess it's something you can use as long as you're living a stable life with a good sleep schedule and no excesses with drugs and alcohol (even tho alcohol is also a drug..).

On some days I feel like I'm the way I am because of bipolar. However I don't think a mental illness can affect your character that much. The way you were brought up is still the major factor in who you are as a person.

Saying these overly positive people about people with this disease would make it seem like there aren't any toxic/bad bipolar people.

So yeah, these posts seem wholesome at first and they're definitely posted with that intent but I do perceive them as 'dangerous' in a way... 
If you're manic and reading this you might feel even more amazing because you've been given the 'gift' of bipolar. Total manic bullshit ofcourse.

So let's keep up the positivity but let's not treat bipolar as a gift. It's far from a gift.

The only good thing about bipolar is that it's manageable. If you're dedicated and take you (fucking) meds!!!"

It's pretty expensive, luckily in Belgium you can get a bit of the cost refunded if you're allowed to following a recommendation from your psychiatrist. 

From starting lamotrigine up until now things have been great! I've been stable for the longest time and starting my job has had a good impact as well (better sleep schedule being the major impact).
