I think it’s because I’m suddenly hyper-aware of myself and really anxious about saying the “wrong” thing. 

In those moments I really focus on being myself and just saying what comes to my mind, whatever it may be, quickly so that I can’t second guess myself 😅If I say something they think is odd or they decide they don’t like me, that’s on them! It just wasn’t meant to be. My mantra is that if you try to be your best self, people for you will gravitate towards you."

Most people in the LGBT+ community are just trying to live their own life, and stand up for equality. 

As someone who is still trying to figure out their place in the world (in more ways than just sexuality) and see past all the hate, this is really hard to read."

relationship_advice,ff5qhye,t3_ertbce,1579606127.0,"I personally wouldn’t ever mind a guy saying he was awkward or nervous about sex - if nothing else it means that you care about it and your relationship with that person. If someone judges you for being a bit nervous or super awkward, it’s really as simple as they’re not the right person for you to be having sex with

For the moment I’d say keep working on getting more in touch with your own body and what makes you feel confident or relaxed and the right person will come along eventually"
AskLesbians,felt6qg,t3_eptgg6,1579230322.0,"You need to be absolutely certain on what you want from this situation - if you want to stay just friends and keep your relationships the same as they are (were), you have to be firm and tell her that.

Then, ask her what she wants you to do and how best she thinks you can move forward - she might not know but at least then the ball is in her court!"

It was the BEST decision of my life, my passions were reignited, I made some incredible, like-minded friends and became a much more independent person capable of SO much more self love, care and respect

You are amazing and will continue to thrive ♥️ you’ve worked so hard, be kind to yourself!"
