AskReddit,fqwa8qq,t1_fqttj93,1589697474.0,It’s worse when you’re not in school and have to fess up whatever useless bullshit you’re up to. Recently my life’s been devoted to building a kinderwhore themed puppet theater and it’s awkward for both parties to hear that.
safecracking,fqw1tzm,t1_fqviisc,1589690532.0,Thank you. I’ve watched it but I really have zero experience with lock picking and only posted here because I wanna get my prescription out of there. I asked a friend who does and he suggested using manicure scissors which was a frustrating failure. The batter just happens to be dead too lol. This might just have to be a hide the safe till they lose their shit and agree to open it situation
safecracking,fqveqci,t3_gl5p8f,1589675706.0,Actually it’s a VE10
NoStupidQuestions,fpdx9na,t1_fpcpbe6,1588536075.0,Yes. This is the answer I’m going to accept and move on with.
NoStupidQuestions,fpdx766,t1_fpc4bbh,1588536036.0,I used to think that but there’s never been any traffic at their house.
NoStupidQuestions,fpdx2ky,t1_fpc59bh,1588535963.0,I’ve looked those up and it didn’t look the same. It’s just black lights giving the house dark yet neon purple. I’ve also read people put purple lights on their porch to support abuse victims but it’s the entire house
schizophrenia,fp9xod9,t3_gba4bn,1588436700.0,It absolutely can! It sucks to lose an art over symptoms :/. Sorry to hear it’s happening to you. I supposedly am having psychosis right now according to my doctor and I play the theremin but I can’t now. the theremin sounds so much like a human voice I feel like I’m playing god manipulating a living soul to howl and cry at the flick of my fingers in the air when I use it and it’s disturbing
schizophrenia,fp9x3m0,t3_gb8xrx,1588436364.0,I got approved for the shot every three weeks a few years ago and it worked so well but it gave me dyskinesia from hell. Eyes would roll back for hours on end and landed me in an emergency room one time when it wouldn’t stop for three days. My mom wants me to go back o. It so bad but I refuse to live like that
schizophrenia,fp9wr2w,t3_gb9m64,1588436159.0,"This has happened to me in the past. Worst it got was at a rehab where I was trapped around a lot of people 24/7. I don’t know if you’ve seen We need to talk about Kevin, but man I felt like this one guy was doing that to me and the staff had to tell him to avoid me because he was a trigger."
schizophrenia,fp9w85z,t3_gb81fn,1588435851.0,"I had a serious alcohol problem over the years. Alcohol exasperates psychotic symptoms (or at least makes you act on them more), the local at authorities know me and went to all the local liquor stores and identified me to not sell me any alcohol. The withdrawals forced me to go to rehab two years ago. Still schizophrenic as fuck and the thought of numbing the symptoms with alcohol is always in the back of my mind but way less hospitalizations these days and that’s a good thing."
schizophrenia,fp5mno4,t1_fp4a8zo,1588334504.0,That’s an accurate description of it. The whole feeling around it changes and becomes disturbing. I’ve always been a little underweight. At one point I was on the invega injection and me and my family went on a cruise with food everywhere and I got slightly chubby. I’m 98lb at 5’7” now and I’m on seroquel wtffff
schizophrenia,fox732w,t3_g8qejh,1588135703.0,It’s an unimaginable demon creature
schizophrenia,fox6qgg,t3_g9cnm3,1588135449.0,I get inappropriate laughter at really deviating things like when a family member dies or terrible accidents. It’s so embarrassing and shameful
schizophrenia,fox5x7q,t3_g9uycm,1588134869.0,Lmao
schizophrenia,fox2yke,t1_fox2dxe,1588132830.0,That sounds about right. I’m aware I’m prone to psychosis but everything is seemingly normal. I just heard someone knock on my fence in unison to my foot tap on the chair and walk around and I’m certain it’s there and things have been following me while still having my diagnosis hang over me. My attention feels more directed to certain things over the other.
NoStupidQuestions,fox1g95,t1_fox02pl,1588131819.0,I agree. It’s something evil but the specific I don’t know. I think this is happening because I tried to translate some occult embelem and nothing on google about it so I asked a friend and I think I summoned something that I’m not going to risk writing down the name of
NoStupidQuestions,fox0rtm,t1_fowzydr,1588131361.0,Ah okay. I can see that in some things. It’s pretty obvious that it’s a clapping or knocking sound and that it’s there and I’m 100% sure it’s not my imagination because it’s not like those little ambient noises that I question hearing or not. maybe I am stressed though my sleeping patterns have gone off the wall
nottheonion,fo6282e,t3_g5i3n3,1587543764.0,Bad choice of hand positioning imo
