depression,fhoua0w,t3_f44bah,1581774044.0,"I am in the same boat as you, I am 17 and Ive been diagnosed with OCD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Social Anxiety. Life is shit. No social life, I feel alone everytime, I feel empty and overwhelmed and I ruined my relationships with people because of this. Worse part is that my dad stopped me from going to the doctor and because he thinks that I'm the only one that can fix this, and I used to be with a horrible psychiatrist and he thinks that every psychologist/psychiatrist out there is bad.

Everyday is suffering and I might end up kill myself too, but I'm still hoping that day will never come same to you. 

It's just sad that no ones gonna save me only myself but I cant even help myself, but still hoping, I hope you stick longer because you may never know that your life may get better."
