I'm 22f now! We were both 19 at the time, he'd come scoop me and we'd drive all around the city, singing cage the elephant and sublime and mac demarco and lana del rey together. Sometimes we'd just park near the beach or a park and talk and cuddle for hours. I think my favorite moment is when we went to some boat docks under a bridge; the night I could say my feelings out loud. We were so comfortable with each other. And it was probably one of the happiest times in my life. Colors are more vivid when you're happy, it feels like springtime when I'm in love. Like the vivid spring you only here about in fairytales. And we were kind of like that, all the time.

Of course, it didn't stay that way. And we did a lot of mean and nasty shit to each other (and we both happily admitted when we saw each other earlier this year that we had both plotted each other's murder), but even after all of that, I still felt like when he was beside me,  I was supposed to be there.

depression,fnj0czu,t3_g1z5rf,1586989600.0,"I also suffer with the deep nostalgia. I'll zone out and travel to my memories and relive every single one that is triggered with every little thing that could be mentioned. And it doesn't help.

I remember in vivid detail walking through the hospital hallway pass the nurses' station where they looked solemnly towards us as my 8 year old self made my way to my grandfather's lifeless body. (2006)

I remember in vivid detail the night my dad was taken away in an ambulance and my grandmother came rushing in with double chocolate firehouse cookies. (2004?)

I remember the day of mother's mom died and finding my mom ugly crying on her bed with the phone near her left hand. (2008)

I remember the day I found out my mom had breast cancer, standing in the valentine's section in walmart in January 2017 and immediately sobbing and the way my dad looked at me without really saying anything.

I remember the first loml holding me as I cried and told him I knew he was going to leave me and the sigh he made when he just held me tighter and the pain rushing when I realized I was right. (2018)

I remember too much. All the time. And instead of maybe just seeing flashbacks, I relive these memories. The tiniest triggers can send me back and my state of mind almost becomes like it was in the moment I'm in.

And of course, as you can agree, this definitely doesn't help my sadness.

dating,fniyhpx,t3_g1uf9i,1586988631.0,"The best way I've found not to send myself down the rabbit hole of self hatred when it comes to the dating world is to stop assuming that it has entirely to do with me (also a big step towards self love, I believe). I've learned not to force it and whoever I meet, I'll meet. And we'll either enjoy each other's company for a while or we won't. 

 However, I do feel broken a lot. I just recently came out of a relationship that could very well be considered my first real, and somewhat serious, one.  And it's a bit of an earthquake in some ways. And I do feel sad. Some days, I convince myself that love is just really not meant for me, even knowing that I've been in love (twas reciprocated, things just fall apart sometimes). It's hard accepting the truth and your own faults and everything else in between. It's even harder to face the downfall (even if you think you saw it coming). I don't do well with loneliness, unfortunately. This has its extreme hardships when I've been in relationships,  I've noticed and I know that's something I've got to work on.

But, at the end of the day, don't blame yourself and don't rush it. That's more important and less antagonizing than anyone (including myself at some point) could have ever realized. And be honest. Up front. And search up cool facts someone wouldn't know or dumb jokes. (it's a sick conversation starter)"

I need money to see (glasses and contacts). It's such a shitty thing to say. Money buys anything I could ever need. 

I feel like this also goes into the people who are like ""YOU GUYS THINK 1200 IS A LOT?"" You're right, it shouldn't be. But it is for a lot of people like me."

dating_advice,fnf6ij0,t3_g16guk,1586902311.0,"Every smile has its own unique beauty to it. I love it most when they make dumb jokes, I'm a sucker for a dad joke. Or just being genuinely nice and showing curiosity and enthusiasm in things we can both equally enjoy that might be foreign to one another. 

For real though, smiles are beautiful. But laughter? It's sexy."

dating,fndbm1d,t3_g0o6jf,1586865678.0,"I dislike it too, even in a casual context. Especially in a casual context, if you can't talk to me about it and you try to hide it from me. In a romantic context, if I'm with you, that's it. I don't want anyone else. I want you to be beside me until we meet our end (in which I'll always hope that we don't but sometimes reality is stranger than fiction).

For the longest time I had this moral code where I wouldn't sleep with anyone else if I was already sleeping with someone. Not because I care about promiscuity or anything like that, but because whoever it was, whether it's serious or not, I'm invested. I broke it back in December/January of this year and beat myself up about it mentally. I felt awful and more alone than ever even though it wasn't anything."

dating_advice,fl67ede,t1_fl6774z,1584856970.0,"Well I mean I cry when I'm happy too. And therapy would be cool except I don't have insurance, and even if I did, with everything currently happening, it's not likely to be available. I was more hoping for methods and advice on how to deal with it without professional help, and I apologize for not making that clear."
