teaching,fqyuiuy,t1_fqx9i2q,1589754780.0,"‚ÄúI think we've gotten to a point in our culture where parents think that schools should be teaching their kids that their actions have consequences and schools think that parents should be teaching their kids the same thing. In the end no one is teaching this lesson to the kids, they are simply assumed to know it already.‚Äù

That statement bothers me because it comes down to nature versus nurture debate. Is it our upbringing or our environment that molds us? Many students I have encountered need that consequence in order to have some structure in their life. If I didn‚Äôt put a system in place, the kids would have eaten me alive. Have you ever worked in inner city schools? The ones that barely have funding and if you are coming from suburbs, they can tell? Those schools I worked in made me realize if I don‚Äôt have a consequence procedure, they will do it over and over. I feel you may be onto something, but not wording it right"
