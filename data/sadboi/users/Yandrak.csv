AskEngineers,fqnmuwd,t3_gjvsdk,1589497709.0,"No better way to know which to choose than to try them both. Apply to schools that have good programs in both, but apply to the engineering major because they're typically more selective and harder to transfer into. Try to test out of the intro calc/chem/physics classes to free up space in your class schedule. Look through the physics class catalog and fill the gaps in your schedule with whatever physics classes you like (usually you can make these fulfill technical elective requirements for your engineering major too). Talk to current students in both majors and find out what the major specific 'hard classes' are, and target their prereqs so you can take them as soon as possible. 

At some point in this process you will likely to encounter a class you love or absolutely hate, and that will help you decide which track to pick. If you find yourself finishing sophomore year and are still undecided, pick engineering because it pays better and offers more job prospects. 

I was once in a similar position as you between engineering and math, until I took a class on real analysis and hated it. Now I'm an engineer with an unusually strong math background, and it often comes in handy.

To answer your last question, there's a huge range but most engineers don't manually build the things they design and analyze once they get out of college. You can find engineering jobs where you spend lots of time in the field or factory floor, and you can find ones where 100% of your time is in front of a computer."

Keep your female friends too, while leaning into your male friendships. Take it from someone who had similar fears around your age and went too far the other way, and then spent years relearning how to have female friends. Most of all make sure you pick good people to be your friends, so that you can be proud of yourself when their habits rub off on you and yours onto them.

Good friendships are also one of the best antidotes to low self confidence. Your friends would never say any of the awful things you might say to yourself, and would try to fight any stranger who did. If you think highly of your friends and they think highly of you, that's a pretty good vote of confidence for your character."
FluidMechanics,fmxwcvy,t3_fxy9pn,1586473176.0,"Whether or not the tap is open, continuity says that the flow rate in a narrow section of the tube is same as a wide section. It does not say your flow will stay constant if you change the system, by closing the tap halfway.

You're also missing boundary conditions. A garden hose flows water over a constant pressure drop. Closing the tap increases flow loss, so the flow rate must drop to keep the pressure drop constant. Covering the opening does the same thing - the bucket will fill slower. If you plug the hose into a constant displacement pump instead of a faucet, you'll find the tap no longer controls flow. When you close it halfway, flow will stay the same but the pump will increase it's pressure to compensate."

There was roughly a 2 week period when Pence was in charge of the coronavirus response and he handled it as well as a president should. Trump saw that Pence was getting attention and praise for the role, so he jumped in and took it.

I agree that anybody in the presidency right now would have a tough time, but credit where it's due Pence definitely would have handled it better. The bar is so low for Trump and he still keeps tripping over it. He even bungled that freebie question from a reporter about what would you say to scared Americans at home.

aerospace,fk5f57e,t1_fk2s77y,1583879235.0,"That's because it's not caused by the Coanda effect. 

Induced drag is caused by downwash from from the wing changing the effective angle of attack on the wing. It rotates the lift vector backwards by a small angle, and the induced drag is the sine component of that rotated lift vector, in the direction of the airflow

That's why induced drag is proportional to L^2. Downwash is proportional to lift, and therefore so is the downwash angle. Induced drag is the product of lift and something proportional to lift."
aerospace,fk48z9i,t1_fk2eozt,1583855749.0,"It's the Kutta condition that says the air must leave the airfoil parallel and can't curl around the trailing edge, not the Coanda effect. It's a stretch to say the Coanda effect is what keeps the flow attached on the leading edge, and IMO invoking an 'effect' obscures a good explanation of how boundary layers interact with pressure gradients to attach or detach flow."
aerospace,fk47xla,t1_fk35sst,1583855146.0,"It's not a fixed proportion, it depends on your perspective. 

There's a concept called a control volume, where you draw an imaginary box around an object of interest, and sum up all the momentum of air crossing the boundary and all the pressure of that air. By conservation of momentum, that sum will always be equal and opposite to the force applied on the object. 

If you draw your control volume really large around the airfoil, the pressure at all the boundaries is approximately equal, so the air crossing out of the boundary must have more downward momentum on average than the air crossing in to compensate for the lift force. 

If you draw your control volume really small, practically vacuum sealed around the airfoil, no air crosses in or out so that momentum term is zero. This means the pressure distribution at the boundary must be uneven, such that it adds up to the lift.

Control volumes are your most powerful tool for fluids analysis, and if you keep studying fluids you will see them continue to pop up. For example the Navier Stokes equations are derived by extending this concept to conservation of mass and energy, allowing the box to accelerate, and then shrinking the box infinitesimally small."
