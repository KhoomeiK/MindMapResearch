redsox,f4be8o6,t3_dk1o47,1571511099.0,"Watched Uehara strike out the last Tigers batter and yelled so loud it scared the dog into peeing on the couch.

A close family member was battling Leukemia at the time down the street at Dana Farber. The next afternoon I drove to say hi and then over to Fenway and the AL Champion banner was already hanging outside. That was one helluva season."
baseballcards,f4bdsx5,t1_f4b2lnv,1571510910.0,So no premium then. I pulled it as well and was hopeful.
baseballcards,f4bdn2b,t3_dk7vml,1571510838.0,"The Goldschmidt is an Advanced Stats to 150, and the Mussina Greatest Players is a black border to 299.

Some of the extras may be available as I want to break another box, I think. I thought it was a much better value than a Hobby Box. Cost me $75 for the hobby box."
baseballcards,f4b1q6a,t3_dk4lvr,1571505244.0,Is that Ohtani an error? It has the rookie emblem on it.
baseballcards,f3rprnq,t3_dhv8fm,1571090441.0,That might be the nicest single-player booklet I've ever seen.  Holy smokes!
redsox,f3g3x1i,t1_f3g2yaw,1570907209.0,"There was also a New York writer who said that pitchers shouldn't win MVP awards because they had their own award, yet voted for Andy Pettitte the year before, and voted for Mariano Rivera the year after… sooo"
redsox,f3g2ny1,t1_f3fzti7,1570906699.0,"99 was easily my favorite year until 2004. I'd been following since 1992, and that team was just fun to watch. Pedro was 23-4 that year with an ERA around 2 and should have been the league MVP."
videos,f3dn3bl,t3_dghcok,1570841352.0,This is my favorite one!!!!!
redsox,f3dlow4,t1_f3blz8b,1570840248.0,"The game was back and forth for the first 3 or 4 innings. Sox took a lead, Cleveland took it back. O'Leary bashed a grand slam, Cleveland tied it. 

Enter Pedro and the death to Cleveland's offense

&#x200B;

The Sox won Game 4 23-7 or something. Game 3 was a nail-biter until Valentin put them up 3-2, and then Daubach hit a 3 run homer. The final might have been 8-3 or something that game."
