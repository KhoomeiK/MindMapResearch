InsightfulQuestions,foqar8g,t3_g8g686,1587988664.0,Would Judas have been as demonized had he not killed himself? I remember when I was still going to church I heard something like because Peter did something similar to Judas that was also a part of the plan when he denied christ 3 times. In both examples Peter and Judas felt extreme remorse according to the text however they reacted differently. Peter went back to his life as a fisherman and according to the story was redeemed later by Christ when he appeared to him after the resurrection. Judas however didnt even give himself the chance and died before even knowing Christ came back. Theres a part of me that thinks (if the story is true) that had Judas not taken his own life he would have been next or maybe even first on the list of people Christ was going to reveal himself to thus redeeming Judas just as he was going to do with Peter who denied even knowing him three different times.
