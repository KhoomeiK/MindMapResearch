I definitely don't think it should be handled in a way that puts this other person through the judicial system, and I think that the person who did the wrong should first be spoken to by the person wronged. I think it's important what it meant i.e. Were they aware they were they were acting against the person's wishes, did they do this on purpose, do they have some other affecting condition, was this a huge repressed thing, did they have feelings for their friend they thought were being reciprocated this way and in his drunken stupor thought this the best way to act on these unexpressed wishes..

There are a lot of questions that can first be answered between the two of them, and maybe the first one is that this person shouldn't drink.

First pulled the covers up and yelled for somebody. Nobody woke to my screams, and the.. thing.. didn't advance in the few times I checked the room. Just lowered or raised its arms and stepped further back in my room. The only way I knew it wasn't paralysis was because I didn't sleep that night one bit.. It just stood there in my room watching me and changing the position of its arms repeatedly. Never been so frightened.

The only other time was driving down a dimly lit road and my dash began to flicker on and off, and then my engine just shut off completely and we had to roll the car off to the side amongst the trees.

Just abort it. Don't worry about whether it's wrong or right tbh. I think that's a conversation to have when you're in a situation where having a child wouldn't make your life very difficult.
