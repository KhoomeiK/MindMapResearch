Parenting,firrjbp,t1_fir9dnm,1582669958.0,I honestly can’t believe that some people are actually complaining about having to “pretend” play with their own offspring....it’s nauseating
science,fhhbycm,t1_fhgujuy,1581600364.0,I like how your brain works😂. Common sense is rare
science,fhhbrv4,t1_fhgn8ix,1581600225.0,It’s like 🤔 no shit😂. I think some perverts just wanted a reason to do a “study”
depression,fhhbbgs,t3_f33d5e,1581599873.0,"It’s better to be alone than in a shitty relationship (which let’s be honest, most of them are). Grass always seems greener....celebrate by doing something for yourself, even if it’s something small. You deserve it"
depression,fhhawnj,t1_fhgx3s8,1581599543.0,That’s hard having to work with that person and be reminded of the past....I honestly don’t think I could do it. Just tell yourself it’s HER loss because it is.
depression,fhhamzr,t1_fhgvqqy,1581599329.0,That’s what I do...f*ck em😎
offmychest,fhh8o01,t1_fhh2ld1,1581597626.0,"Ok, I usually just read these and don’t reply. Please, get help if you feel depressed. I was in a similar situation but I have two little boys also. I was married 15 years. I was so depressed and twisted in my thinking that I needed a divorce. Now I’m in a much worse situation than I even anticipated. I thought I knew what I needed but my judgement was so clouded by the depression and I was too stubborn to admit it. Reach out to someone and admit you need some help."
nursing,ffzxypt,t1_ffzdsne,1580395745.0,I once was told by my manager that I was given a perfect evaluation because I was a great nurse but was told by upper management that she had to pick something to put a bad mark on since “no one is perfect” ended up giving me a bad mark on my dress code. So they basically just reinforce mediocre work....wow. F*ck me for trying
depression,ffdvvl7,t1_fe8mr8m,1579830220.0,"I feel like a self absorbed asshole to talk about it to anyone. Like maybe it’s not that bad. But why when I wake up in the morning, I feel like....damn it’s real, this life I have to get myself out of bed and act like I want to be here...what is the point anymore?"
