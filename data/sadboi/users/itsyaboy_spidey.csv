Its just im disappointed of my OHP which is just at 23kgs and i started march 1 at 17kgs. I feel like doing the 3x12 is  super hard that keeps me delaying on progressing the weight thats why i asked if maybe 4x9 will be smarter cos i wouldnt be exhausted as in 3x12. I hit the 3x12 today on that ohp 23kgs and next session ill add weight to it

I now increase my sets like 4x12 to compensate for my unassisted pull ups.
