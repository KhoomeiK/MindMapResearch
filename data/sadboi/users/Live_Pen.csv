BPD,foa6nek,t3_g6d29q,1587640965.0,"For me, the number one thing with dealing with people with BPD is to validate their feelings. They might be unreasonable to an NT, but to the borderline they feel very real. Not validating them makes us escalate massively.

So in an argument, saying something like ‚ÄúI gather from what you‚Äôve said that you are feeling x.‚Äù Where to go from there is discussed further in DBT skills.

If they are pushing away and being cold, saying something like ‚ÄúI see you need some space. I‚Äôll give you some space and I will still be here for you at the other side.‚Äù Guaranteed, they will come back, probably apologetically. It‚Äôs worth considering how to look after yourself through these times too though, as you also have needs in not feeling abandoned and in feeling supported. With one of my ex boyfriends, we had a sign that meant we needed space and would take it and talk about things more later or just cool off (we would literally write ‚ÄúX‚Äù and that meant ‚Äúactivate our plan‚Äù)."
