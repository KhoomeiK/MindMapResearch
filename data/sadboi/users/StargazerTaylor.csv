It isn’t good or bad on its own- but it can be an indicator for diagnosis- what is going on in someone’s body. Most traditional doctors don’t bother measuring it. A functional doctor, Endo, or internist who is trying to get to the bottom of a problem or clarity of the problem may want to look at it.
The body creates rT3 in certain conditions- extreme or severely chronic stress and inflammatory diseases. Etc. I wouldn’t worry about the ReverseT3 test much. Free T3 is the one that is far more useful for actual treatment."

Hashimotos,faenstk,t1_faejag4,1576004498.0,"Yes and no. For the first 6+ months I didn’t know I was hyper. But when my thyroid tanked it was very sudden- within days or a week everything shut down. From my energy to my GI tract to my brain. But I’ve had other episodes or flare ups that didn’t happen so fast. Also, Synthroid (T4) would take me days at least and sometimes weeks to respond, whereas Cytomel (T3) worked in hours. 

Thyroid symptoms are cascading. It tends to start with fatigue, then worsens into GI symptoms/slow down, then weight gain and skin problems (dryness and slow healing) tend to happen about the same time. Lastly cognitive symptoms like memory issues, brain fog, and depression really kicks in when things are very low. That said, for me, T4 only corrected my fatigue and blood levels. Ultimately I needed T3 for my cognition, GI symptoms, and mood to improve. Once that happened I was able to lose the extra weight much more easily and finally feel like myself again."

I don’t know how postpartum your wife is, but remember that women make much more thyroid hormone while pregnant and then have to adjust back down after the baby. She could have thyroid disease, but it’s also possible they treated her for hyper too soon and could have let her body adjust on its own over time. Although she may have ended up hypo anyway like many of us new moms do.

You may need thyroid meds some day.. but keep this blood test and make a note on it- that you feel healthy/good when your T3 is on the higher than normal side. Most docs won’t prescribe T3 meds for normal ranges, like 2-3, but imagine- if you function well at 4.3 T3 and 10 yrs from now it’s at 3.0 and you feel bad, you need T3 but most docs will tell you that you don’t.
