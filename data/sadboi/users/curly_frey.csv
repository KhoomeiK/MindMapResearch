BPD,fqoeec3,t1_fqodvkg,1589513374.0,"right! learning about invalidating environments was so VALIDATING! just putting in perspective what you dealt with over and over and over again. maybe the op did relate to you more than i, but even society as a whole can do this to us. that’s why i love this sub!"
BPD,fqodpeq,t1_fqodh2y,1589512934.0,"whoops! i meant invalidating environments! which i suppose could be arguments but i think generally it is the people we are surrounded by or society at large that tells us our emotions are invalid, too intense, don’t make sense. which is a horrible rabbit path as these are exactly what can reinforce our feelings that we are hoping to better cope with!"
BPD,fqodavv,t1_fqod1h8,1589512682.0,"those are experiences that i cannot even imagine. i’m glad you’re here! i just started dbt, and it’s theory is two fold: biological vulnerabilities and invalidating arguments. it makes sense that dbt works so well for bpd management, as it seems as though those same two factors contribute to having the “diagnosis.” i’m not a huge fan of bpd even being a diagnosis, at best it would be a spectrum. love this group - hope you do too!"
BPD,fqoc7h8,t1_fqobsz2,1589512006.0,"well through a lot of therapy i’ve learned that what has most likely affected me is being adopted as a baby, dynamics in the small rural town i grew up in, and relationships with men. i think it’s important not to forget the biological vulnerabilities that are a huge part of the bpd makeup. from meeting my biological family, i see that there are a lot of borderline characteristics in them (mother’s side)."

pelotoncycle,fnjf6up,t3_g1myx7,1586997737.0,"I purchased a Peloton bike because I admired the company’s decision to equip people with free subscriptions while quarantining from the pandemic. To make this free subscription absolutely worthwhile, I decided to finance the bike. I noticed yesterday that I had a $41.73 charge not long after I purchased my bike. Janice informed me that the 90 day subscription waive is for non equipment owners only. This is deceitful by the company, as it is not implied in the advertisement of the subscription waive besides what I am assuming is fine print. This is a major lack of transparency on Peloton’s end. It makes absolutely zero sense why anyone can get 90 days for free but someone who invests in your main product does not receive that benefit. The most frustrating part about this is the choice to not make it apparent when advertising 90 days for free. Will share this review until I receive appropriate follow up on Peloton’s end.  Poor Janice couldn’t help, but surely someone can."
