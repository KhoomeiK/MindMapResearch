I did that to my other family members but didn't tell them why. They are anti LGBT. They message me saying hey girl but in my native language. Didn't answer at all I know my parents told them so no excuse. I don't put up with other peoples crap. Instead of giving her the pleasure of knowing that it bothers you don't answer her calls and texts. Block her and let her know what it feels like to lose a child. I know it sounds harsh but people never appreciate the people they have until they are gone. My parents tell me they love me but sometimes I don't think its even true. I wish you luck those type of people are everywhere.

konmari,fnk6ai4,t3_g1scer,1587016252.0,I set a limit to myself because I also have a small room to work with. I only kept two things that spark joy but are not essential to live. Maybe do a thirty day rule. If you haven’t used an item in that amount and are not likely to use it in the next thirty days you should allow yourself to get rid of that item. I donate or give it to someone for no charge. Or if you want to you can sell it. Maybe only keep the top items that you use the most. Maybe it won’t be a bad idea to just keep the items that Do fit on the room. It’s not ideal to keep an item just cause you like it but don’t know where to put it. That’s call hoarding. And it can become a terrible habit. My sister is a hoarder and it pains me to see that she has so much stuff only for it to end up lined up in selfs. Yeah she loves collecting K pop albums and novelties. But she said she is planning on buying yet another shelf just to stock up on more albums and novelties. It’s like a museum in there. I prefer my room to be clean and minimal in items.

depression,fnabwyz,t3_g0b70h,1586794776.0,I think most people with real depression suffer from this. Many studies have found that when a subject is suffering from depression they can’t produce the happy chemical or enough causing a chemical imbalance. Compared to sadness where the subjects brain can produce the happy chemical and they have normal levels of chemicals in the brain. The professionals can tell you that it’s depression because depression is not classified as a serious illness or not taken  seriously and they only care about money.

Minimalism is about keeping what you really need/ really use. You don’t need to get rid of all your books if you get value out of them. Three books is nothing what I did is I kept a little of everything. I completely got rid of my collections as it triggers consumerism. I kept my tv and ps4 ( most of my games are digital), I also kept a couple movies and music cds I don’t have digital versions of yet. I plan on keeping all my media digital so as soon as I get the digital I donate the physical version. I have Hulu, Netflix and Disney plus so whatever I can watch in the streaming services I donate as well. I also kept my blue ray player cause on weekends my family comes together to watch rented movies. I also have a few more electronics that I do need like my laptop. I also feel like I have too much sometimes but It’s not about the number of items you own. you should watch the minimalist YouTube channel, they give you tips and more information about minimalism.

depression,fmisf59,t3_fvc9gt,1586115974.0,I honestly wouldn’t go back to her. My mom is the same if not similar to this lady. She technically uses dad to pay everything she wants. She is begging for divorce now and out of the divorce she still wants him to pay her bills and Macy’s receipts. She says she only buys clothing for my little sister but I know between a couple of items she receives stuff for herself as well. My sister doesn’t even like what mom buys and she should have a right on what to wear she is 10 years of age. To begin with she was looking for someone to do all the work for her and she got it. My mom is never home and only cooks when she feels like it. She takes the 10 year old with her but she says they are just locked up in a apartment. Everyone is starting to think she is running away from responsibility. She claims she gets bored and I know she is behind her friends brother she told me herself she is looking for a new husband to move in with after the divorce. When they were dating my mom didn’t even like my dad. She was convicted because she had no other choice. Life is hard where I come from you even get beat up by the cops. It’s just suspicious to me that she didn’t even like you with flaws and decided it was time to get back with you when you turned your life around. She gives me gold digger vibes or something. Be careful.
