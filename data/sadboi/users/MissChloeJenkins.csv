transgender_support,fkxep6v,t1_fkxdylm,1584626479.0,Wrong clearly you dont know my body so please dont give me you're wrongful opinions because only I know what's happening and I know I get periods being getting them for 3 years it's called womanhood and second puberty.
transgender_support,fkvmaeb,t1_fkvlu7d,1584572122.0,"Well not necessarily because some trans women call it a period because its part of our dysphoria and not only that but because I'm a girl I call it my periods because I'm a woman and I never got to chance to experience it when I was a teenager so that's why it's my womanhood and it belongs to me because it's a part of me it's what makes me, me. You can say you disagree but I believe that me calling it my periods is what it is because it's part of life as a woman."
transgender_support,fkvlgfa,t1_fkvkp5j,1584571630.0,"The cramps come from around or above the pelvic bone but every woman experiences menstrual cramps in different areas, Every woman gets a period regardless if we dont have the organs to provide it alot of women get these symptoms of a period through Hormone replacement therapy but not all girls will go through second puberty. It's hard to explain what a cramp is if you've never experienced it it's a very very very uncomfortable feeling the muscles have spasms for when this occurs and it's the muscles contracting together but because their is no uterus their it acts as if their is one there and we still get the same feeling as cis women only that we dont bleed."
transgender_support,fkvkk5u,t1_fkvkd1w,1584571097.0,It's called being on hormones? We get the symptoms of the period but we do not bleed.

Even if you are a little overweight that does not make you any less of a woman it's just a part of oestrogen it puts weight on you. As for the height their are alot of women over 6ft you see these girls in foreign countries were they are breaking world records for the tallest woman on earth, I can't remember her name but I think she's dead now but this woman in china was towering over 8ft so their is no height restrictions as to how tall or how fat or skinny a person can be.
