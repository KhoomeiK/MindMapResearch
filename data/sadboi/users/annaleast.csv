I’ve had other mentally ill people, who claim to be allies and advocates, try to distance themselves from me by comparing my condition to terminal cancer. My condition negates my humanity to most people. I am viewed as subhuman at worst, and at best hopeless and tragic. I don’t want to advocate for mental illness- I want to erase the concept of it as such. I want people to think of me as somebody with a neurological condition no different than something like epilepsy. Mental illness isn’t a meaningful or helpful concept. It’s simply illness. The delineation between “mental” and “medical” only furthers the oppression of the mentally ill.

As to over reliance on service dogs, that’s a reasonable thought if you have a condition with alternatives. Things that respond to treatment consistently, which coping skills can really help with, and that are in some sense curable. Schizoaffective is not any of those things. I focus on the cPTSD aspect more, because it’s easier for most people to understand and sympathize with, but the schizo is as much or more of a problem. I am not going to get better. I wish there was a cure, but there isn’t. There won’t be in my lifetime.
