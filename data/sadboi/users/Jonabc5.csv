BPDlovedones,fr36dva,t3_gmdp89,1589850862.0,I feel you dude. Definitely found me at a very vulnerable time. I wish i just didnt ignore the glaring red flags. It sucks because i think shes an awful person but sometimes i just miss someone being around.
BPDlovedones,fr0je9a,t3_glvrf8,1589797779.0,"My favorite was when she said “you don’t even want to spend time with me!” Yet, i was home every night and she was going out to see friends every fucking night! Like how can i spend time with you if you aren’t here? Makes zero sense."

darksouls3,fr0ins8,t3_gl7q3p,1589797044.0,The dancer. I have no clue why as it was during the release but that bitch made me whip the controller across the room a few times.
BPDlovedones,fqz4m8m,t1_fqyzfvw,1589759824.0,"Ugh i did the same. She never once thanked me for sacrificing so much on her, she was just even more of an ungrateful bitch after."
BPDlovedones,fqz4dka,t3_gloeb7,1589759706.0,"Oh yes. She would quit her job randomly but assure that she could still pay. Of course she couldn’t. Then she did it again the next year! And ill add during her second hiatus from working she had a secret relationship. Needless to say i left.

Its amazing how you help someone you care about one time and they take that as “oh your paying for everything now”. I feel like my bpd sufferers are terrible with money anyway."
BPDlovedones,fqyp0xc,t3_glnuho,1589752183.0,"Woah sorry you have to go through this but, its for the best. Im getting the hoover attempts and its very painful for me at least. I know her behavior is worse than ever. I just wish i could completely stop caring."
BPDlovedones,fqtqy4k,t3_gksujw,1589644375.0,"Thats seriously disturbing dude. If you dont even love her, leave. She has no emotional empathy for you since shes acts like a bitch."
BPD,fqtjpgy,t3_gkvhh3,1589640344.0,"Sounds like maybe theres a lack of emotional empathy on your part. Meaning, you aren’t observing how things you do which you may not be aware of deeply hurt others. Its not your fault but it is a big part of BPD. I suggest getting a therapist who works with bpd. Sorry if this sounds harsh but it seems like the common denominator here is you."
BPDlovedones,fqtjccj,t3_gkkv7h,1589640140.0,"Yup, same thibg happened to me. She previously stated this friend made a creepy pass at her. Come to find out they were talking and saying lovey dovey shit. She was having an affair all that time. And when she realized that “friend” was violent and mentally unstable she gets on her hands and knees begging me not to leave. I told her why wouldn’t i leave you heartless bitch?"

BPD,fqrrx9w,t3_gkd5yv,1589590609.0,Please get a divorce for your own sake. Ive been in a similar position but not married. She’ll never get better if she doesn’t need or want to change.
BPD,fqmhfqf,t3_gjlupt,1589477502.0,I praise you for being wise enough to know its not an excuse. That means you’re growing and learning how your actions effect others.
BPD,fqmgxm9,t3_gjnrpg,1589477267.0,I don’t think its a good idea to have him around for attention purposes. Its using someone and thats not very nice at all. I’ll just suggest you seek mental health care if you think you have bpd. It will only get harder the longer you dont do anything about it.
BPDlovedones,fq5vbhh,t3_gh0yai,1589118373.0,Weird behavior for sure. My expwBPD constantly texts my whike she is currently sort of seeing someone. I’ll admit i have slept with her during this quarantine out of boredom but it does seem to me like shes trying to hook me in again and trying to intentionally make me jealous. I can see through that bullshit now and i dont care but its weird behavior and im curious if she did this to me while we were together.
BPDlovedones,fq21xb7,t3_ggfn3e,1589052098.0,"Im wondering if all pwBPD are giant slobs. Mine was the same as you describe. Dirty piles of clothes everywhere, garbage littered all over the place and she never cleaned"
BPDlovedones,fnpwle7,t3_g31h0s,1587153323.0,"Actually thats what she first said when she told me she had bpd. “Im an empath bpd”. Of course this doesn’t exist since bpd has a lack of empathy component. They confuse sympathy with empathy i think. They can show how much something effects them but they cannot understand how you feel in regards to their behavior. Its really annoying to experience since empathy is something i dont think about i just have it. They will hurt you so bad and honestly have no idea why you are hurt when its them thats hurting. Again, super annoying. Im not even sure years of dbt could change anything about them since they also constantly lie to therapists."
BPDlovedones,fn7ragg,t3_fzv7sh,1586726039.0,Hell ill chuck this in but when i was with my exPWBPD i started doing drugs(benzos some opiates) again just to handle the stress. I was totally clean for 4 years to. Made me feel gross and embarrassed but theres only so much you can take. Luckily im put of that and back on the old straight and narrow.
BPDlovedones,fl22rvc,t3_fm2pph,1584741644.0,"I lost my rose tinted glasses before the break up and saw her for what she was. A liar, a cheater, an alcoholic and most importantly, a lack of empathy for me. Its hard when i think of our honeymoon phase but she almost ruined me completely and i know i made the right decision."

BPDlovedones,fkhhs9p,t3_fiigkt,1584199140.0,"Leave him! This is finacial abuse and it only gets worse. Trust me, mine put me in $10k credit card and stole about another $10k."
BPDlovedones,fkef0nx,t3_fhzx5h,1584111811.0,My exwBPD went inpatietn at least 5 times when we were together. She’d be good for a bit then revert back all the time. She didnt want to do what they said so obviously it wasn’t going to work with her.
BPDlovedones,fkbl0e1,t3_fhibkd,1584034944.0,Sorry to hear that man. After leaving my pwBPD i see know that all the stories she told about “creepy dudes hitting on her” are lies and she most likely cheated on me a bunch of times. I dont feel bad anymore about that because she is not worth feeling bad over. Shes a sack of shit. I only regret being so naïve and stupid believing all her lies for so long.
BPDlovedones,fkbkm4w,t3_fhk0mq,1584034733.0,No one is going to make them happy unless they are happy being themselves. Some just cant understand that and are totally unwilling to change and do the hard work needed. Apparently remission is possible but that doesn’t mean episodes will never happen again.
BPDlovedones,fk7c5q7,t3_fgsn88,1583933225.0,"I hear you man. The whole faking the relationship thing is what they actually do. I had her begging for me to stay after finding out she was cheating(very rudely btw, her secret bf broke into my house and i had to get physical with him to get him out. I fell for it but not long after I realized this girl is a sack of shit and i deserve someone better. 

Having her gone has been the best thing ever. No more worry, no more anxiety, no more losing money, no more theft and no more lies. I just started seeing someone who is really great and honest and kind. Its amazing what a normal relationship feels like.

Congrats to you for ending that bullshit. You made the right choice."
BPDlovedones,fk4dnmn,t3_fgby9v,1583858394.0,"Dont cheat. Of course that was broken numerous times i now realize after leaving. You think people would see that as common sense in a monogamous long term relationship but apparently not. 

I set so many boundaries that were always broken. Its like a game to them i swear."
BPDlovedones,fk4dcwn,t3_fggk12,1583858226.0,"Oh boy i can relate. Telling them to pick up after themselves, to throw your trash out, to not leave all your clothes all over the floor. I don’t understand how my expwBPD didnt understand proper hygiene or basic cleanliness."
BPDlovedones,fjxec6y,t3_ffblf9,1583669972.0,"I was in a similar situation. The truth is that you do these “bad” things because you really do not like being with a pBPD and you want to leave but you are hesistant.

She made me feel like i was a bad partner when she was cheating on me the whole time! Its total bullshit. You do these things because life with a pwBPD is an anxiety riddled hell. I say, dont be hard on yourself and really ask yourself “is this what i really want?” I also want to add that her behavior will only get worse and that you should leave. Leaving was the most freeing experience ive ever had."
BPDlovedones,fjrvsyu,t3_fes5z1,1583590701.0,"I would leave. It is as bad as it looks. I was in a similar situation with denial but once i saw huge credit card debt that she gave me and the alcoholism i knew i had to get out. The only thing i regret now is not leaving sooner! If i did i woukd still have my old car, that she totaled, and $2000 more in the bank.

Trust me, this will only get worse and worse. You will leave at some point but i say just do it now when you have an easy out."
BPDlovedones,fjb9964,t3_fcjn9u,1583189040.0,"Truth dude. I can’t believe i was abused and stolen from multiple times. Of i cant believe i fell for such obvious lies. Love blinds people. I think that deep down most people in a bpd relationship want to leave but are afraid to. I was. 

And also, leaving them will make you so much better. Bye bye crippling anxiety and paranoia!"
BPDlovedones,fj5l52c,t3_fbj1ux,1583035465.0,"Exact same thing happened with me. Delete that part. Dont say “absolutely no bpd”. It oddly will attract them. Believe me, its already happened to me."
BPDlovedones,fj3d7th,t3_fb9syx,1582979301.0,I really think pwBPD don’t understand boundaries. Mine would break everyone i ever tried to establish. It was like a game to her.
BPDlovedones,fj2mkzl,t1_fj0xaun,1582947622.0,"Oh god this resonates. Mine would always complain how mean her parents are to her and how her siblings gang up on her. When the rose tinted glasses came off i saw how much of a headache she was to them. Constantly fighting with her mom, super sensitive to any criticism and overall just being nasty. Not to mention shes a total alcoholic and was always piss drunk at her parents."
BPDlovedones,fisfyon,t1_fisanaq,1582684117.0,Better than ever. And its all from finally letting them go. You’ll never feel so free and happy in your life.
BPDlovedones,fis5fmm,t1_fis2jtx,1582678179.0,I just deleted that part. You know you think it makes sense to write that but these people literally make no sense. Their desire to destroy all boundaries is illogical.
BPDlovedones,fis21yg,t1_fis0w4g,1582676021.0,"The boundary thing, thats exactly it."
BPDlovedones,firbdu9,t3_f9fkbg,1582661116.0,"Leave him and do yourself a favor. You probably have done nothing wrong and i guess you have gone above and beyond for him just to be treated like shit.

BPDlovedones,firawsu,t3_f9fug5,1582660845.0,"Honestly its hard to draw a line with BPD. The selfish and lack of empathy is BPD for sure. For your case, its very profound and out of line. Could mean shes awful on top of bpd."

dating_advice,finjopl,t1_finjf26,1582564579.0,Texted sunday something short. But yeah i get ya. Ill probably call her up on break to see.
BPDlovedones,fik0t66,t3_f8ag54,1582469924.0,Yeah thats dumb. BPD is a serious serious mental disorder that destroys those around them. If only they could take responsibility for truly shitty behavior.

BPDlovedones,fi4hq7p,t1_fi3kh9z,1582141423.0,Damn 5 years. Luckily most of my family doesn’t like her anyway (red flag i overlooked). Hopefully she just goes to whatever dude shes cheating on.

With my pwBPD its hard and i may regret that but the amount of money she owes me is insane, she fucked up my car and is only know trying to take responsibility for her actions and life.

BPDlovedones,fgd0976,t1_fgcygam,1580677847.0,"Woah thanks dude, really needed to hear that. My pwBPD sounds very similiar to your ex.

Nice to be reminded what no BPd looks like."

I chose to stay because i was afraid but looking back i should have just left then because i cant even look at her the same way anymore and im tired of all the bullshit. Currently im seeking a way out and trying to find someone else. Call it revenge or whatever but i know it will make me feel better.

Take like 50 (100mgs) at a time and that should prevent withdrawal and then you can try to wean off the Imodium. The immodium works all day. Also, try to get on to suboxone, its a real life saver. I am not bpd, my gf is, but i am a recovering heroin addict whose been clean for years.

Deal with the addiction first then seek out help. At the moment that cant really evaluate you correctly until the drugs are done.

Take care and try to get clean. The dope sickness sucks but its like you cant have that much pleasure without having an equal amount of pain at some point."

We have had very good times and it was a joy to have her around. Its just with splitting and impulsivity, she becomes a pathological liar and extremely disrespectful.

Ive seen glimpses at a healthy relationship (its been 4 years) so i think its possible. But if they are unwilling to seek help and do the hard work, then it really wont be."

I know that she is just a person too and ive always tried to put that first. I know who she “is” when shes confused and i make a real effort to hear out how she is feeling and validate those feelings. I do really love her and we are planning to get married in the next year.

It’s not easy to have a relationship with someone with BPD but if you really love the person, you will put the extra work in."

I think thats a good idea to start asking about more details to figure out if shes feeding me a line of shit."
