Trauma can really align us into being doormats for others and I say good on you for working through things. Though you may or may not be 100% it's endearing to hear that you have drawn a line in the sand. Now, with that in mind, my feeling is that you have to watch out for you. You've survived and you've been in the thick of it, at a certain juncture, you're going to be the doormat or the self sufficient individual we all know you're capable of being. 

You've survived, you've thrived and you're going through a setback. Hopefully your counselor will assist you in making an informed decision on how best to proceed forward. Be sure to try and steer clear of the ""drama triangle"" and identify if and when you may be swooped up in it..."

What was the ""straw that broke the camels back"" as they say? Was this a gradual onset for him or completely out of the blue? Cruising through your post history it would appear that you are under the guise that you've aligned yourself with a narcissist? Does your current husband have an official diagnosis? Is he being treated for it? 

These are a few of the items that come to mind for me along with a few other questions I'd continue to unfold to try and get to the ""crux of it"" as they say. Realizing there are two sides to every story, and having endured things in multiple relationships in my past, I'm curious what spooked your husband so quickly? Less than a year ago you had posted about your wedding, who would marry you etc, etc and then things really took a turn. Were there red flags you chose to look past and maybe the COVID-19 craziness that's happening has inflamed your marriage? 

Speaking directly from your firsthand accounts of what you're going through, it'd most likely be best to begin working on a gameplan of how you are going to navigate the extreme times you are in now. At the end of the day, as much as you love someone, your happiness and wellbeing have to be first and foremost. Take care of you before you ever think of taking care of another as your happiness should be shared, never one-side and NEVER-EVER dependent on one another. =)

Is it worth your investment of time, potential money and energy into prolonging this out? Would it be more advantageous and ideal for you to get in, get it done, get it over with and move forward? 

On the surface, this seems pretty cut and dry with what you've mentioned. But, if there are more questions that can be answered to shed a little bit of light on it, that could potentially move your decision in another direction?"

You had also mentioned that your STBXH is a narcissist and if true, have you researched how to approach and interact with someone who does in fact have narcassistic personality disorder? Has he been clinically diagnosed? Does he take medication?

Personally, if it were me (I am freshly moving into separation myself), I would compile the data into what it will cost him, what the ongoing costs will be per, during and post-divorcr, alimony to you and the length of time etc. How much attorneys fees and court costs will be for the both of you that he will have to repay. Really try to factor in all of the costs WITHOUT the emotion attached. 

You also had said your husband is a business man, yes? Surely your husband wants to make the soundest business decisions both personally and professionally for himself? Why would he act on impulse and not analyzing the situation when it comes to leaving you? Will you be entitled to seize business assets he's involved with his family business as part of the divorce?

Some other things to ponder as well. You're freshly 40, educated and have phenomenal caretaking abilities. You do sound (from what limited info I've gathered) like a caring and good Mother. With that being said, I do hope you are able to traverse this extreme experience and look back one day to realize it was but a stepping stone. You're a bright example to and for your child in how people treat each other within relationships and come out of things on the other side. With you having migrated here from another Country I'm left with the impression that you've endured and survived worse than this, potentially? 

Though what you are experiencing is far from a drop in the bucket or a walk in the park, you will persevere and make it. Stay strong for you and your child. Work on yourself for you and your child. You've got this, we believe in you and we are pulling for you."

I had seem some stuff and was working 10-12 hour days non-stop with minimal rest breaks etc etc. Suffice it to say, I was a bit stressed.

So, a buddy mine was walking around my cube area to pondering if he wanted to jump from the role he was in to working in my department. Later on he told me that he was really on the fence about it, until he walked passed me on a phone call. From what I recall now, over ten years later, the homeowner I was talking with was in default, four months behind on mortgage payments and we were set to begin the foreclosure process anytime.

After going back and forth with the homeowner for a number of minutes with him battling me on foreclosure, repayment, etc. I finally had it and told him something along the lines of ""no sir, I don't think you fully understand the gravity of the situation. I have the mortgage to your house, we have had the lien on your house for x amount of years, if you don't make arrangements to repay the back amounts, sell your house, or get the paperwork started on saving your home, I will allow this to go forward into foreclosure, your home will be foreclosed on, your home will be auctioned off, you will be evicted and the home you've had for x number of years you will not be in."" It was at this point that my buddy wanted to link up with my department.

Those were serious times and QA was out of the window because of how bad lending institutions were hemorrhaging money. It was not common for me to interact with anyone like that in my professional capacity but it was all that I had in order to get through to the guy. Ultimately he got the paperwork going, his home was saved, payments were amended and brought current, his family remained in the home and I ended up moving on from the job when the economy recovered.."

The dates and times are utterly useless UNLESS you have corroborating witnesses to back you up and let's be honest here, if it comes down to the off person out or someone's livelihood, you don't stand a chance.

ptsd,fjc88xn,t3_fcoi0a,1583211330.0,"Having been diagnosed with ""GAD"" and ""depression"" for the better part of 25 years. It wasn't until I found a good therapist, put all of my mental healrh cards on the table, had a crisis in his office, lost a job, and he diagnosed me with PTSD. It took two years for that diagnosis to be made, TWO YEARS! 

I react to stress and sudden change with anxiety and fear. People call me ""high strung"" because I'm talking a mile a minute one second and the next I'm completely closed off. What I experience may pale in comparison to what you or others endure but know that from the walk I've endured, you aren't your diagnosis. If you set out to read everything you can get your hands on about your diagnosis, it'll educate you but it won't fix it. Time, therapy, forgiveness and coping do that.

If you read about PTSD and feel the symptoms fit what you go through or have been through then your compass is directing you. It's up to you to put one foot in front of the other to reach a state of peace and what you may feel is ""normal"". Too many times we stay wrapped up in having an ""anxiety disorder"" or suffering from ""depression"". The bigger picture, in my opinion, is that we aren't given the freedom to understand that depression and anxiety are the symptoms of a much larger root cause. The symptoms are like an iceberg, only the top 1/3 of it is visible and it's up to us to chip away at the top in order to make way to the bottom.

I hear a whole lot of stories though and a good friend of mine lives in North Seattle. To be honest, I have no idea how she can afford to eat with the cost of living in Seattle! Lol

I'd personally suggest you call IUPAT DC5 Local 300 Painters and tell them your job history, what you are looking to do and who they recommend you reach out to. They just might be willing to give you some info and if you are able and willing to travel out of town on per diem work, that may get you a foot further in the door.

Best of luck to you on your endeavors and sorry I can't help you on the Seattle scene. I know just enough to know that I can never live there. Lol Good luck with the move!!!"
SeaJobs,fill990,t1_filk9f4,1582504231.0,"Me? No, I'm not a painter but do work for a painting company. I will tell you that your best bet to find work asap as a painter is to reach out to Local in Seattle and ask them about joining. With your experience you sound like you'd most likely be a journeyman commercial painter and if you're hired by a company, the Local will train you and certify you to give you higher value. If down the road and you make it on board, and if you can jump from commercial to industrial, it will be worth more for you in hourly wages as good industrial painters are harder to find than commercial painters.

Also, another huge problem in most of the skilled trades up here is not doing any drugs, including pot. Although marijuana is legal here, there are a ton of contractors and companies who do random testing. UA's include drugs and MJ which if found in one's system, they will be terminated from most places. Maybe because of the potential liability but I can't be 100% sure on it. 

Something else to think about is that Seattle ranks as one of the highest in cost living per capita in the nation. I remember reading a statistic awhile back that to live at the poverty line within seattlw proper you have to make $110k per year but I could be wrong. A lot of this has to do with Amazon being headquartered in Seattle I think. Homelessness is rampant and the rents are atrocious all over the place. It's not uncommon for folks to reside an hour and a half from seattle and drive too and from everyday for work... hopefully you've thought and planned this out?

The other has job hopped since returning home, suffers severe symptoms of PTSD and struggles day to day trying to process what he lived through. 

Trauma and stress impact each of us in very different and profound ways. Just one of the instances you've described could emotionally scar someone for a lifetime and yet for others, it comes with the territory of the job and doesn't carry the same weight mentally or emotionally. The ultimate say-so in when and with whom you may elect to seek treatment lies within yourself. Speaking from my own personal experience, if you're displaying symptoms of any kind, reach out to a trained professional who helps process traumatic experiences because of the events you've lived through and have survived. 

When I asked my buddy who returned from active duty and from the outside appears to be successful how he channeled and coped with his situations. He told me that everyone reacts differently. Before he left to go overseas, he had a great support system, was always a happy and upbeat person and he spoke of his experience being in army recon with fellow personnel who may have not been necessarily mentally ready to cope with the situations they were thrust into when they were. 

This is not to say that an instance like this may be applicable to you but hearing my friend talk about it, he mentioned that even before his service, he didn't take life too seriously. My other buddy who suffers now had mental health challenges when we were in high school together and thus may have had more of a disposition to not be able to channel what he endured in the same frame of mind and now he suffers but he's been on the pathway to recovering for sometime now. 

My point is that you are ok to not be ok. If you are in crisis or in need of help in any way, shape or form; get those resources asap.

Then there are those clinicians who don't know ""when to say when"" and accept that yours and my mental diagnosis is ""outside of their wheel house"".

Me having traversed 25 years of therapy off and on until finally receiving a PTSD diagnosis.

What's probably helped me is reading. It was tough at first but over a long period of time it's helped dial in my focus, especially when I read things that really interest me as I'm a natural curious person. Hopefully that may help you and I wish you the best of luck as PTSD is so challenging without the help of a trained professional and a healthy support group..."

ptsd,fg6plsr,t3_ex6za3,1580573960.0,"Call your Doc or Prescriber and ask if they can recommend pharmacy discount cards. Also ask then how long you can go without being seen for then to order refills. Historically my providers used to write scripts good for 12 months without a requirement for me to be seen and thus your script could be good for a year without unnecessary appointments. Also be sure and check for generics and if available, be sure they are good for your genetic dispositions as not all generics are created equal. If you're close to a border country such as Canada or Mexico, see if it is possible to go there and see a prescriber to get your drugs at a much better rate than domestically... hope this helps

ptsd,ffb7ev1,t3_eslv7y,1579753865.0,"When I stop and think about it I was undiagnosed for easily 30+ years! I've had killer anxiety and racing thoughts since I was a teenager and I haven't hit 40, yet. Time has shown me a great deal but finding a good therapist in correlation with proper diet, exercise and a routine has helped the most. Therapy has done so much but it wasn't until I found a good therapist that things are finally beginning to *click*. 

The best thing you can do for yourself is to seek guidance into healing whatever trauma you've endured. Getting with a good therapist who can assist in navigating and healing trauma will surely pay off in dividends no matter how you shake it. At least this is how things have worked for me anyway. I will say that there are still bad days. Still days racked with anxiety. Still doom and gloom. But then there are some good days as well. When times and things seem to go ""up"" instead of being down and dreary all of the time. 

You've got this."

Everything they're doing is a paper trail to backup their reasons for dismissal and my advice would be for you to document everything as well. Ask for specific feedback when you are being written up or corrected because from the sounds of it, you're being walked on right now and put into a light of being walked out of the door. It's a sad reality but it happens, even if you're the hardest working one there.

Leadership is stressful in it's own right and you've found that out the hard way!!! I wish you the utmost luck in your endeavors and I have definitely worked some crap-@$$ jobs in my time. In those experiences I've found what works best for me are clear and concise metrics of performance and processes that are developed and in writing for me to reference. Having a phenomenal manager whom you know will have your back also makes all of the difference too imo.

The only honest piece of advice that I would offer you is to create the environment you'd want to be a part of. You're strapped, stressed and at your witts-end while in need of some help from your Management, your labor and your environment. I'd also highly recommend reading some books on leadership, listening to audio books etc or if you're lucky, find a mentor who will help you with direction. This is only if you do intend to remain where you are until you're financially able to move on down the road.

Best of luck to you."

After confiding in a handful of therapists and being diagnosed as ""depressed"" since age 14 I will tell you, keep searching for the therapist that brings out the best in you and surround yourself with good people. It gets better when you have the support system in place. Even after almost two years of weekly and bi-weekly appointments with my therapist, I still ha e bad days and you will too.

But, what I notice is that the better days are exceeding the bad. Rather than a rollercoaster of ups and downs it's more of a mountain to ips and downs. There are bad days, truly. It will get better and I believe it and hopefully you will, too."

Is there stigma? Sure! I've had two people at work f*ck with me by asking, ""does this trigger you having these files out of order"" and another one asked if I was on prozac or what... So, yeah. People can and will be d*cks.  But you know what? Seeing people like you all in here opening up about it reaffirms to me that the more open we are, the more aware people will become. 

To f*ck what ""they"" think when I work harder than they do, make less money and get far more done in a day than they could ever dream or imagine possible. F*ck em all when I've been a top performer for Fortune 500 Companies and had people rave about me being their boss. 

""They"" don't live the life that we all do. ""They"" wouldn't ask someone about being a quadriplegic or having downed syndrome.

Not to say this will be the same for you BUT if you were to disclose the need for a medical accommodation and it's within your local laws to do so, you may opt to disclose an anxiety diagnosis. Follow that up with the journeyman you're teamed up with causing you triggers and it might be sufficient for the company to move you on board with a different journeyman or foreman, depending on how your union and company operate."

Remember the problem with email; you don't see the person's face, hear their tone or see their body language. You could be misconstruing something and if you need clarification, fire off questions to the person. You ask enough questions of them and they will eventually leave you alone. Very importantly, remember that if something is bad enough, your boss will bring it to your attention and not your counterparts. You're just over 60 days into this job and you aren't expected to grasp everything yet. Give it three more to six more months and if you continue making the same mistakes THEN you'll have things to worry about."
