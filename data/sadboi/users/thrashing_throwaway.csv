It seems like every time I see a doubter in the wild or when I was lurking those subs (probably to terrorize myself), commenters where identifying as nurses. There are nurses who do crap like this on Ticktok and Instagram too. 

I feel like nurses can be some of the most compassionate people, but I also feel like many nurses are susceptible to not believing patients.

But it’s not just nurses. I have had attending specialists just not believe that anything was physically wrong with me, and then MRI results would return and indeed I was a 20-something with idiopathic spinal stenosis and degeneration. 
I was later diagnosed by a connective tissue disorder geneticist with severe HJS, just barely missing hEDS criteria. My prolapses/hernia, joint injuries were more prominent than the degree to which my joints where hypermobile. And that diagnosis has really meant nothing to my PCP. I don’t look forward to the battle when I regain insurance. 

I just had the horrible realization that he didn’t give me an appointment summary sheet other then a journal article, IIRC. My god, what if he just did all of that to placate me? 

Like the gynecologist who said I had a slight uterine prolapse, didn’t write it down. And then a few gynecologists/NP gyns said there was definitely no prolapse and that they didn’t know what I was talking about. Years later, a urogynecology surgeon was examining to confirm my moderate posterior vaginal wall prolapse/rectocele and he found the uterine prolapse as well. 

I was just a child when all of my issues started and keeping track of it all has been so difficult. I spent months gather and sending old medical records and the clinics lost the packets of records & never made it into my chart. Someday, I’m probably going to have to pull all those records again.

And mother & narc uncle co-signed too. My triggers are intertwined into this mess. I resent them so much for being in a position to better help us, but they don’t. I hate myself for not moving to my spouse’s country like he wanted and planned, before my family begged me to stay and they agreed to co-sign sponsorship. 

So, best not to violate the affidavit in the first place. There is nothing a lawyer can do as a preemptive strike. 

Is this what you mean? Fighting the grounds of the affidavit? What could a lawyer do?

I become a wreck when I have to reach out for help because the help rarely helps enough and comes with baggage, stipulations, and judgement. A few times I’ve tried to work with a caseworker as an advocate and it was just not enough. I know that’s just the way it is, you have to prove your material circumstances to receive any kind of help, but that doesn’t stop my trauma response as well as my physical overstimulation. 

I recently got a couple letters in the mail from our county department responsible for welfare because I was trying to regain my disability Medicaid coverage. And I was sobbing because of the tone of the notes the social worker wrote on the bottom of the page, most of which weren’t necessary. It is all so invasive and accusatory—and after all these years with dealing with them, they still make me breakdown. It truly triggers me. But I already know I’m going to get denied because despite him not working in 2020 (through no fault of his own), we have a savings over the asset limit for Medicaid so we have to buy an ACA/ObamaCare plan. But the catch is that we can spend every single penny of that savings, and sure it might buy us *the cheapest* ObamaCare plan, but it’s not actually going to cover my medical needs and medical bills as a chronically ill, disabled person. Because those cheap plans with poor coverage aren’t written for disabled people.

If I do state hearing on these issues, mother and narc uncle get dragged into this, which terrifies me.

>I have spent the week drinking 3 bottles of whiskey straight, around 35 cans of hard cider, overdosed on my medication, and been self harming, starved myself on purpose, and puked up blood. I also what I can only describe as a psycotic episode believing a hot water bottle was my unborn child.  This issue is unfortunately not a new thing for me, but I have lost a week of my life to try and end my own life. I am not a human being anymore, I am a corpse warmed up. I am broken in so many ways my head just spins and I can't control anything anymore. I am so tired of living but I don't know why I didn't die during this week, I just wish I had. All of it is my own fault, I'm not looking for sympathy, just, I dunno anymore. I don't know who I am. I've just lost everything.

Follow your passion. In a few years, you can plan a means to supplement your income should you need to in the future. You could also live frugally. A lot of self-employed people do just fine compared to wage and salary workers.

There are so many people miserable working a 9-to-5 salaried job. And almost every single one of them is—to some degree—afraid of losing their job. Nobody is truly guaranteed pay. 

Continue drawing, plan for the future that you want, and in the meantime your parents should continue to emotionally and financially support you because you’re still so young!"

This is really sad. It’s a support sub for depressed people. Having a child doesn’t cure clinical depression. Also, leaving a support forum and “never looking back” also doesn’t cure depression.

For me, my Nuncle was very loving and (selectively) generous and very popular with almost everyone he met, but was also super emotionally abusive and committed closeted elder abuse. Not all narcs are the antisocial or malignant types. 

My Emother has emotional issues and has a codependent dynamic with my her Nbrother/my Nuncle. She is not a narcicist, but I would classify her as a mixed atypical/typical emotional abuser.

I have had specialists get frustrated with me simply for bringing a list of my symptoms, or for bringing research. When I pushed the neurologist for a second opinion, he was so arrogant. Then I went to the second opinion of an affiliate neurologist and she was legitimately pissed off and told me to return to the main clinic because I had too many issues for her to address. This seems to have been the story with most of the specialists I’ve seen.

I almost feel like the clinical psychologist “set me up” with that fake diagnosis because when I reported the fake diagnosis back to the referring psychiatrist (who also hardly knew me) the psychiatrist said, “Divided ADD? What? No...your MMPI says you have Borderline Personality Disorder.” And what are BPD people (unfairly) known for? Lying. I looked like a liar and I am almost certain that they discharged me from the Depression IOP because of it. 

Apparently unmanaged autism/adhd + chronic illness can look like BPD on the MMPI. 

That clinical psychologist was even being a jerk about my bad and inconsistent handwriting when I was there for a suspected LEARNING DISORDER.

It took almost 10 years after that for me to get proper testing!"
