summonerschool,fqoif78,t3_gk0lvu,1589515954.0,"Braum is good but tends to be more situational in the current meta. He's a strong pick that brings a lot of utility and beef to teams, but not so much that it outshines enchanters like Nami, Janna, or Lulu. Most of the time that he's a pick/ban champion its been because he was overtuned and either did too much damage (they nerfed Q for this), or was too hard to kill/made someone else too hard to kill (W nerfs).

&#x200B;

Braum Lucian is pretty much 100% auto stun and PTA proc. Its the classic screw-you-in-particular lane comp. Lucian's passive applies on hit effects, making it possible for him to AA-E-AA+innate to instantly proc your passive if you land a Q/auto. Anytime you play *into* this lane, you pretty much just pray to ASol that the Braum is bad, otherwise you spend the entire lane walking away anytime Braum walks up with his Q off cooldown. This lane does tend to struggle against extreme range/poke. If played correctly Caitlyn, Sivir, Varus, and Miss Fortune are able to survive or poke the Braum down enough that he can't safely walk up to Q and initiate pressure. Braum can also struggle into champions like Vel'Koz and Brand during the early game because they have high damage and CC to back it up. Its a very common weakness for tanky melee supports, and while Braum can block some of the damage with his shield wall he isn't an exception.

&#x200B;

Braum Kalista works extremely well post 6, and has a decent enough early laning phase to be worth playing. Having an extra gap closer on Braum creates an immense amount of pressure post 6, something akin to Malphite ultimate attached to a more useful champion after the engage. Given that Kalista takes HoB almost exclusively right now, your duo can look to trade aggressively whenever you hit your Q and her keystone is available.

&#x200B;

By and large you're just going to try and fish for hits with your Q. 9 times out of 10 if you have a competent AD (for your rank bracket) they'll walk up and try to proc the stun when its safe or free to do so. If your AD doesn't proc the stun (because they have a good reason not to go in for the trade) its still a win for you because it develops a 3s window where the enemy has to back off or risk getting all-inned. This creates time for you to position for the next trade, walk to sweep a ward, or just walk into or past the minion wave to pressure the enemy further back. It also gives your AD the time to do the same or to force shove the wave with abilities without risking a trade in most cases.

Pre 6 Braum is very reliant on creating pressure windows for his AD to play freely in. Most players will understand the sheer level of threat Braum represents in the early game when paired with Lucian or another marksman who can easily proc his passive. Because of this, you get to start a lot of Braum lanes with a psychological advantage; it gets very hard to play the bot lane when you feel like you're constantly 50 range away from dying or being forced back."
AsheMains,fql6x4w,t3_genrfc,1589448378.0,"Been testing this a bit myself. My observations are; for games where you:

A) Aren't fighting a huge frontline making Bortk a 100% need

B) Aren't fighting a comp where you won't get time to stack tear

C) Are looking almost exclusively to skirmish, have a split pusher, and poke/clear when grouped

&#x200B;

Manamune is probably going to be a great if not ideal option. It obviously depends on your 2v2/3v3 matchup but it does a lot of what Bortk does in terms of raw damage output with your Q/Runaan's, but trades the massive shred for better synergy with volley spam. Manamune can't be played every game because you don't have an ability that procs on hit effects like Ezreal's Mystic Shot does, and you really do need to go for one of the other builds depending on team comp.

&#x200B;

**Addressing your specific build and the problems I see with it:**

Rageblade just isn't good enough to play on Ashe. Its great on champions who bring really strong (and not bugged) on hit passives because it cheats out more efficiency from the item than it normally has. This is doubly true for champions who do at least 50% of their output as magic damage, because the %MR shred is almost impossible to obtain otherwise. Its the reason why champions like Vayne and Kai'sa take Rageblade, but champions like Caitlyn don't. Vayne's Silver Bolts are basically the *entirety* of her damage, and Kai'sa just likes every single stat the item gives. Caitlyn, while she has an on hit passive, doesn't utilize the other portions of the item, making it more efficient for her to just go for a crit build, which she does have incentives to use. Ashe is pretty much the same on that front; it has a nice passive that would be welcome in her kit if it was free, but not at the expense of an item slot, and paying for an amp tome+ of unwanted stats vs crit.

Death's Dance is too much of a win more item to justify buying it over any defensive items/crit. Bruisers get measurable survivability increases from taking DD because they one have much better resistances to mitigate the damage being converted into the burn, two have defensive tools/conquerors that allow them to stay in fights longer while taking damage, and three have large enough health pools to actually survive long enough for those tools+DD to give them the breathing room they need to finish the fight. Marksmen (other than probably Draven... because axes) just don't have enough of any of those things for DD to be worthwhile. You don't have a large enough health pool for the bonus armor and MR to really save you from positioning errors, most of the time when you're killed 100-0 its either via cc where you cant fight back and heal or its so much damage that it would never have been sufficiently mitigated with DD to matter. The healing is nice to have but doesn't matter if you're already dead.

Botrk is a crazy strong item, if you're getting it I just wouldn't build the Manamune. There really isn't an efficient path for you to get both  going at the same time. Its kind of the Ryze issue. RoA and Seraphs feel amazeballs together, but having to delay scaling on one for the other feels really bad. Botrk is so strong that you really want to get it early (where the lifesteal will probably have the most impact on saving your life), and tear needs to happen sooner rather than later to ever have a hope of hitting Muramana and being efficient. The issue is Ryze actually likes just having mana, so he's perfectly happy to have just a tear and not Archangel's if thats the way things go, but Ashe gains literally nothing combat stat wise for having a tear sit in her inventory because she needs to finish her Botrk. I really feel this is just an either or.

Trinity force likely belongs here just because it rewards you for doing all the things you want to do with the Manamune build. The phage passive is also pretty much the only thing that's going to make up for losing the active MS buff from Botrk. I go into more detail below on why its so important to get this, but quickly, Manamune-Triforce-Runaan's is an incredibly powerful and cheap item setup and gives you a lot of the mid to early late game power that you would otherwise lack in this build. It gives you really well rounded stats, a little more surivability, and synergizes too well with Manamune to not take it.

Luxury builds are cool and all but you need room for defensive buys. Yes you will have games where you can just yolo build 100% crit no consequences, but those games are almost always just going to be a matter of skill gap. Any game where its even marginally even you're not going to be good enough as a player to just disrespect buy 6 damage items. Its why you don't see it in pro play or in high elo games. There's just too much value in having an item that is both efficient for you, and denies the enemy from executing their game plan. A lot of winning games comes down to balancing between fulfilling your win cons and denying or delaying the enemy win con. If their win con involves making sure you only see color when  you're in base (which it will because you're the DPS) then you better buy something that keeps you alive long enough to win the game.  This means GA, QSS/Mercurial, Mercs/Tabi into some matchups, or even occasionally just PD. DD doesn't count.

&#x200B;

**As far as my experience playing with the Manamune build:**

I've tried Comet, LT, and PR for keystones, LT definitely felt the best, especially since we're dropping Botrk to make this happen. I haven't played around with triforce yet on this build (I had been skipping to Runaan's, *don't skip to Runaan's*) but it should be your next pickup. I think its helpful to look at Manamune as a replacement for ER in the volley spam Ashe build. You're trading early CDR and crit for better synergy with your Q and arguably better single target output at 3 items; if someone else has done the math to check that I'd love to know the exact difference.

Once you have 3 items and fully stacked tear you have a deficit of around 30-45 AD to the ER/Triforce/IE build, and 20% less CDR. The tradeoff is a net positive of 40% extra attack speed (thank you Runaan's), the extra manapool for relatively endless volley spam, and Muramana's ""shock"" passive. At lvl 11 with max mana the passive deals an additional 108 damage to your primary target and through the bolts from Runaan's, which doesn't compensate for the loss of damage from Frost Shot or just the raw AD from the item changes, but its delivered for 1700g cheaper. That's a very, VERY big windfall in games where you need literally any utility buy. 1700g is (almost) full boots and an executioner's calling, lv1 boots and a QSS, and is just 50g short of being enough for lv1 boots, stopwatch, and a chainvest/crit cloak. I think there's a lot of literal value in being able to for a near peer build to ER that hits your item timings that much faster without having any awkward troughs outside of laning phase.

The Manamune build, while weaker on paper, tends to be a lot more fluid at utilizing Ashe's kit than the ER build. Yes the ER build has the extra CDR for sub 1 minute CD ultimates, but from almost every game I'd played using Comet & ER I never really got to fully utilize Ranger's Focus or Volley. Because of your low attack speed and high CDR in the ER build it always felt like I was making a choice between using my Q or using my W. You can pretty much just W-AA-AA over and over on the ER build, but then you have really awkward moments where you just sit on your Q, fully stacked and hope for a good time to  use it. With the Manamune build you have a little more downtime in between Volleys, which makes it really easy to weave in your Q for a more fluid style of play. It definitely comes down to the specific game, and your playstyle, but I feel like the Manamune build just ends up being really flexible for dealing with changes in game state.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: There's some items that need to be changed around but Manamune can be good or perfect in some of your games.  It lets you go for some really cheap builds and snowball your midgame out of control with Ashe's CC train."

summonerschool,fl2uctb,t3_fm6m1m,1584760139.0,"90% of the time the issue is that you‚Äôre not farming enough to have impactful damage to keep up with Zed.


The more efficiently you back, and the less can you miss while in lane, the more raw stats you‚Äôll have come mid game when Zed really starts to pop off.  A lot of the time people complaining about Zed or Talon being overtuned is really just lamenting that they‚Äôre not playing well enough to *not feed them in the first place*.  There are very few relevant champions outside of the support role that can‚Äôt solo carry a game from 7/0/0 or more, especially for assassins.


The most important thing to remember is that for mages and assassins, they get a huge amount of value for just leveling up their abilities, and in some cases, from just having a component item or two.  Zed is absolutely a champion like this, and it‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so reliant on getting kills in the early to mid game to stay relevant. If you don‚Äôt feed Zed early, he will only be able to trade kill at best (assuming no one is walking blind through the jungle after he splits a side lane), or just suicide at worst.



So what does this mean for you?

A) Most importantly farm efficiently. There are a lot of great videos (and websites) that teach wave mechanics and back timings for better tempo. Yes being able to last hit is of paramount importance to your income, but being able to set yourself up to lose the minimum uptime on your farming is almost as crucial to your mid game.  This is doubly true for ADC players, as we are usually under leveled (duo lane), and just playing more late game oriented champions than the other 8 players in the game.





B) Learn good warding. You need to have some concept of when you should ward in relation to your lane state, and the number of enemies on the map. You also need to learn to watch mid for mia, track top tp timing, and actually use the deep wards that you and your support should be looking to setup when possible. If you manage to do all this you can avoid a lot of bullshit from assassins just getting free reign of your games.




C) Itemize correctly. When playing into assassins you need to buy defensive early, not last. Just like it‚Äôs sometimes fine to buy an early executioner‚Äôs into heavy heal comps or a dorsal lane, getting the early tabi, or chain vest, or stopwatch can make a world of difference in your survivability.  Remember the main goal you have as an ADC is to survive. You will almost always out dps everyone else in a fight if you get the time to do so. Especially when playing into assassins you want to try and give them as few advantages as possible. Will it hurt your damage early? Yes. But it might also help you get to late game where you can make them irrelevant, or at least keep on pace with their scaling from getting solo xp on you.


Hope this helps."

I‚Äôve always tended to enjoy champions that can direct my team to do things, rather than just waiting for other people to carry me. I‚Äôve never reaaaally liked all in champions like Draven, or any assassin really, but anyone who had some ability to influence the map easily and/or hard cc.

The POV videos are the best for teaching you what a timing looks like and where warding is efficient. Your lanes will almost never look the same but the concept is the same. You really need to work on everything if you‚Äôre not winning because support is the hardest to carry monkeys with. Especially the see no evil üêµ.
summonerschool,fk7ntgb,t3_fgykmi,1583940196.0,"... you don‚Äôt?

The rule of monkeys applies here. If you‚Äôre really not a monkey, then your team has 4 monkeys and the enemy team has 5. You automatically beat monkeys if you‚Äôre not a monkey, so the math is in your favor.

You probably experience this in Overwatch at some point or another, but it‚Äôs very, very hard to be objective about your own gameplay.


Did your mid and jg feed their asses off? Yes. Did you 100% do everything you could to set them up for success? Probably not. 


As the support you have freedom to be a ‚Äúsecond jungler‚Äù in the sense that you can control bot side vision and gank mid lane (or top but that‚Äôs a little weirder of a timing thing). You first and foremost need to learn what and when is an efficient ward timing/placement. This involves jungle tracking, wave management in respect to the 2v2 or 3v3 matchup, good map awareness to watch other lanes (especially in respect to objective timings). It‚Äôs something that really isn‚Äôt mastered even by challenger players, who really can still be monkeys sometimes; better monkeys, but monkeys nonetheless.

If you can ward properly and you‚Äôre still not winning (low elo players don‚Äôt always watch map or pings), then you need to be ganking other lanes to feed your solos and tilt the enemy laners. If your AD backs and you‚Äôre still high hp/mana and you have mobi boots you might as well be inting if you don‚Äôt just roam towards mid and look for a kill. As long as you‚Äôve been tracking their jungler (and the other support mind you) you can get essentially free pressure on the mid lane. If you‚Äôve picked a safe timing you can either force a kill or force the enemy to leave lane. If your laner is behind don‚Äôt overcommit, just relieving some of the pressure so they can get a better back timing is huge.


Separately, if you and your AD back together and you have boots and a pink ward you should go aggressively ward towards the enemy jungle. Pink wards are vision denial first, and ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù wards second. Especially when a dragon/herald is coming up or going to be contested just killing a trinket ward is efficient enough to justify a pink. Even better, making the enemy support or jungler lose time killing the pink let‚Äôs you know exactly where they are so you can make a play somewhere else.



Every game really is a coin flip, but more often than not you can try and catch the coin and place it on the correct side. Playing when tilted, and blaming your monkeys is never going to help you improve, or climb.

The biggest reason I‚Äôve been loving this build path though is the sheer amount of safety it gives you in the mid to late game. First of all the early cdr is huge because of our free stealth, and the move speed on Shapeshifter procs makes you extremely hard to chase down for anyone without a suppress or instant gap closer. I‚Äôve had so many ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moments that have just gone clear in the other direction just because it‚Äôs so much easier to kite when I only have invis and root to really keep myself alive.



I‚Äôve been running Nashor‚Äôs, Gunblade, greaves/sorcs, and then whatever AP item is most relevant for the game (mpen, burn, raw stats, etc). I‚Äôve also been taking HoB with alacrity just because it lets you abuse the enemy laners at 1-3, and pretty much guarantees a passive proc in the mid to late game with your items and scaling AS. Again it‚Äôs all about the passive for me, super safe without giving up too much burst."
neekomains,fjdzak0,t1_fjdwnqj,1583262143.0,"Eleanore NA. The reason I like HoB is because it‚Äôs *immediate* a lot of the time you don‚Äôt get to wait for LT to start up, where as with HoB you can proc your passive (it‚Äôs really great starting with the empowered auto to get two procs in ~1.5s) because you mostly want the ms for chasing for ult or kiting. I just find it makes me a lot safer if that makes sense. Ideally I think LT is the best late game option, but in low mmr solo queue (god bless this season has been rough from low plat to low gold with my placements taking) it‚Äôs usually a lot better to play around your team rather than with them. It always feels like teams prioritize diving carries to peeling their own, so the lack of front to back really reduces the effectiveness of LT since you‚Äôre a 550 range champ. HoB is really potent lvs 1-6 and just gives you a good amount of safety as the game progresses."
neekomains,fjdu6wz,t1_fjdtpia,1583259331.0,"I‚Äôve tried PTA with doran‚Äôs and I haven‚Äôt liked it too much. I find that the sustain is nice but the lack of early AP severely hurts your burst potential/wave clear. One of the big advantages Neeko has in the early game is being able to out trade most marksman while still shoving the wave for lv2/crashing the third wave. The extra AP helps a lot, and at least for me HoB helps a lot late game for the way you want to play fights.

I‚Äôve been Running Nashor‚Äôs into straight AP, the stats and passive smooth out your team fighting/dueling by letting you proc passive, while also reducing your shortcomings from a weak mam√° Pool and relatively long cooldowns. I‚Äôve found it makes you a lot less opportunistic in fights, and you‚Äôre able to play more like a safer Vayne or Kai‚ÄôSa because you have so much self peel without giving up damage for it. Also W max on this build is the truth, it‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt been going PTA tbh."
eu4,fjdt3bj,t1_fjavvi7,1583258714.0,"Budget monk has the best strategy that I‚Äôve seen, essentially you ally Albania and improve relations with the Mamluks (to make them give subsidies during the war) you move your entire army to Morea and start spam building more troops. With a good enough admiral you have a stronger combined navy, at that point you just start an infantry unit in Constantinople and time your declaration of war to the moment that it spawns (as enemy forts are mothballed when no enemy troops are in adjacent provinces.) if you set it up correctly you can cheese the first fort in Anatolia and then occupy al of the eastern ottomans. You only need like 2 more forts in Greece and then the ticking warscore will carry you to core reclamation and break the Ottomans early. From that point try to ally the Mamluks (and Hungary/Venice) and start spamming wars on the Turks."
supportlol,fja0xol,t3_fca81e,1583164051.0,"If you don‚Äôt go for an all in comp picking a really self sufficient enchanter or mage usually goes a long way in terms of your mid-late game usefulness.

To me Lulu stands out because she has the highest potential ms of any support and can win the vision game by taking advantage of timing windows unavailable to other supports. This might not help you win lane, but may give your mid/jungler the info they need to make the bot lane disadvantage irrelevant.

Janna is fantastic because she brings a very high amount of damage for such a safe enchanted. She does a lot of work in team fights, especially if you have multiple auto attackers and get ardent. She‚Äôs also just really great for absorbing harass through her shield, and punishing all ins with her tornado much in the same way that thresh will with a well timed flay.



I also really really enjoy lanes with or as Soraka/Zyra. 

Soraka is pretty self explanatory, high sustain, broken late game, super forgiving if you can position well; she also has one of the only direct silences still in the game which is absolutely devastating to caster lanes. 

Zyra has some of the highest 3-5s damage of any support in the game right now, even after she‚Äôs had some of her power shifted away in the past. Anytime she‚Äôs able to lane Q-W-AA she can break almost any trade if you and the AD are on parallel. It‚Äôs not so much the upfront burst (even if playing with electrocute) but the extra autos from 1-2 plants supplementing your follow up. It‚Äôs very hard to trade a Zyra lane that positions correctly, and she can even time her plants to block terminal skill shots with good prediction.



None of these picks are perfect (I don‚Äôt know if there really is a great answer to a 2x mage lane other than play wave control for jg timings) but they have helped me with a lot of ‚Äúlost at select‚Äù matchups in the past.

Of course the easiest route is probably 2x mage v 2x mage but that‚Äôs harder to setup in solo queue where you don‚Äôt have too much coordination and the ad likely doesn‚Äôt have a good amount of experience in mages, but I digress."

I feel like taking straight AP after seems to be working out better than Guinsoo just because you get more ‚Äúoomph‚Äù out of everything else.

All three of these champs have gap closers, high damage and survivability, and good skill ceilings to allow personal progression towards real mastery.


It‚Äôs also important to note that things like Nunu are fantastic because the enemy *knows* what you‚Äôre going to do but usually still can‚Äôt do anything about it unless they‚Äôre playing super far back in lane. Champions who can exert so much pressure with minimal thought or input allow you to really focus on your pathing and macro game, as well as timing ults/summs all of which end up with you becoming a better jungler in general regardless of which champ you‚Äôre on.

You forgo a lot of pressure if you‚Äôre not running defensive runes simply because you‚Äôre increasing the value of the enemy laner‚Äôs runes if that makes sense.

Even if they only get a little extra damage from taking 1x adaptive or attack speed, it‚Äôs a really big differential in the amount of damage you‚Äôll both be taking (unless of course you‚Äôre Galio, Oriana, etc. And time everything correctly. The main advantage is you don‚Äôt need to make massive outplays the entire lane to survive, which allows you to go for bigger trades and stay in lane until you can get an optimal reset or gank timing. Other exceptions are champions who scale extremely well when they have that boost of adaptive damage for the early game, especially though who have healing scaling off of their primary star, or who are just such potent lane bullies that they tend to win most trades even if they eat a ton of damage from the enemy.

At the end of the day runes really are preference. There‚Äôs a lot of variance in what even challengers take for the same champions, so it mostly comes down to how you feel more comfortable playing the game."
summonerschool,fj4olm8,t3_fbh37l,1583013151.0,"Because vision denial is extremely potent for contesting objectives and setting picks.

There was a post a few days ago talking about the real utility of pink wards lying in their function as on demand quasi-sweepers and I think umbral fits into this category. Not to regash the post too much (it was very in depth) good players will ward things that they *need* vision of for the next few minutes or so. Being able to instantly deny them that vision, especially if they‚Äôre working off of the warding totem is extremely powerful and one of the most undervalued tools in the game below diamond.

In any champion who already wants sweepers and lethality, glaive gives you a huge amount of value and an advantage over teams who rely on their support and 1-2 other totem wards because you have that immediate denial.

If there‚Äôs not an objective and your team isn‚Äôt pushing for vision (you should be helping your support here) you should be shoving waves to crash on tower when safe, or just shoving them past river and resetting.

Generally if you have an assassin midlaner you should be lane swapping with them after you take your tower or your tower is taken. This allows them to split push increasing their farm, and then make picks when the enemy rotates to either match them, or beben they try to leave the lane to play towards your team if grouped. The other benefit of going mid as AD during the mid game is getting the short lane while having enough damage to match the enemy mid. It lets you be where you need to be for objectives and get your levels faster. It also gives your support more freedom to roam for wards/ganks.

Your 2 priorities are to get the most possible cs, and to not die. You‚Äôre not supposed to win team fights for your team. You‚Äôre not supposed to solo carry the game or make the flashiest outplay.
