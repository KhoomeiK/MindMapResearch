When I was about 12 I spent a week with my distant family. I held it in for as long as I could but by the 5th day I had no choice. It was HUGE and clogged the toilet. There was nothing else around so I ended up using my toothbrush to break it up so it would flush. I told my family that I dropped the toothbrush on the ground and threw it away so they would take me to get another one. They thought I was being dramatic and that I should have just 'cleaned it off' and still used it. .....No.....LOL"
