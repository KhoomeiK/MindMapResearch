Nobody likes it when people do that. Most of the time it’s ignored, annoying, and just considered spam. I’m not trying to shit on your post or anything but this is the way it is. 

If you want more views and likes on your tracks then I suggest you reach out to artists individually, show interest in their stuff, and maybe they’ll return the favour. It’s worked for me and it’s honestly nicer than getting random plays and no interaction with the people who are hearing it. 

Also, post about your track on your Instagram or snapchat story. If somebody’s following you on Instagram, they’ll probably have enough interest in you as a person to give your stuff some attention and if they like it, they might even repost it and share with others. 

You’re right about this subreddit being dead. My advice is do not rely on this subreddit to give you views and praise. Do not rely on ANY subreddit actually. Start off with friends and family who will actually care to take a listen and give you feedback and then grow from there. 

If you tell a stranger to listen to your stuff and there’s no benefit to them if they do, why would they at all? Focus on the people that care about your passion toward your shit. They’ll listen, and your audience will sprout from them."
