offmychest,ffsi5p4,t1_ffrxh86,1580182284.0,"There‚Äôs nothing I can think of that really stands out, many of my female relatives are older and still date/have boyfriends; I‚Äôm not sure if this was something I kind of came up with myself because ever since I was a kid in middle school I was anxious other people were starting relationships and not myself. I think this caused me to see myself as ‚Äúold‚Äù because I was the same age but at a ‚Äúlesser‚Äù point than others"
offmychest,ffshyw7,t1_ffs8jdf,1580182151.0,"I‚Äôm 21. I perceive old to be 30+, I think I would consider myself even ‚Äúolder‚Äù if I‚Äôm not married before my 20s end"
dating_advice,ffepeg4,t1_ffeomay,1579858791.0,"I‚Äôm not trying to contest your advice, I do appreciate it, but honestly it‚Äôs so hard for me to like someone in the first place, I‚Äôm lucky if I can find even one person to go on a date with within six months. I guess that‚Äôs one of the things that‚Äôs wrong with me :/ because if I suspect I won‚Äôt like someone enough to date/marry I feel too bad going out with them in the case that I have to end up rejecting them, should I proceed anyway?

I don‚Äôt notice a pattern when guys lose interest. Things seem to be going decently well and they just turn on me. With the last guy I was talking about in the beginning of my post I did notice, looking back, our first date wasn‚Äôt great because he kind of tried to cut it short. But continued to talk to me for only a couple weeks after the first date, then ended up truly ghosting. Went on two more dates after him but I ended up not liking either of them. I don‚Äôt demonstrate hostile or erratic behavior ever"
dating_advice,ffep2tk,t1_ffeott1,1579858294.0,"He does know, the only reason we haven‚Äôt had sex is quite frankly on him at this point. I already have feelings for him so I‚Äôm probably gonna just keep hoping things will work out, but we haven‚Äôt seen each other in a few weeks now. I was literally planning on doing it the next time we see each other which he‚Äôs aware of. I‚Äôve expressed concern about the time apart, straight up asked if there‚Äôs something wrong, and he says nothing is wrong and has kept reassuring me that we *will* see each other soon. Still texts me. But nothings happening. I make it very clear to him that I like him, I‚Äôm thinking of just straight up telling him not seeing him is making me nervous/making me think he might not like me anymore

What made you and your ex gf break up if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? :/"
dating_advice,ffeltv4,t1_ffejsk8,1579853565.0,"I appreciate your comment! But I get so confused. People tell me men my age, which I‚Äôve found to be true, aren‚Äôt looking for anything serious bc they‚Äôre so young. But then if older men are the same way bc they think *I‚Äôm* young then what are my options after that :/"
dating_advice,ffelqdi,t1_ffel81s,1579853435.0,"I‚Äôm meeting them via dating apps, I know it‚Äôs not ideal but I think it could be a great outlet for meeting people out of my immediate social circle, which is a population in which dating is not possible for many reasons anyway. I put in the description I am looking for a relationship. I live in the suburbs/sort of city. SoCal. I‚Äôm a senior in a state university and I‚Äôm planning on going to medical school (MD/DO degree) within the state, going out of state is not an option for me for personal reasons. 

Typical dates are restaurant/meeting for coffee/movies for the first date. This guy I‚Äôm dating now hasn‚Äôt made an effort to see me for quite some time but we did normal couples stuff plus me staying at his place. Until now, I‚Äôve never gotten to a point where it‚Äôs time to explicitly define the relationship. Guys I like lose interest or I cut communication after the first date because *I* am not into them. Even with the guy I‚Äôm dating now, we talked about exclusivity but nothing very specific, I get uncomfortable trying to talk about it. The way we act implies bf/gf, and I know everyone says to not assume but I was okay to not directly talk about it till later. I have not had real sex yet. This guy I‚Äôm dating now is the first ever guy I‚Äôve have sexual activity with (started on the second date) but we haven‚Äôt had intercourse and tbh I would‚Äôve done it with him by now if we would just see each other again"
childfree,ffdbmqz,t3_eswhlv,1579817405.0,I have to remind my own mother of this all the time. She sort of has this mentality and I just tell her she still needs to have a sense of individual identity because it‚Äôs unhealthy to weigh all significance of life in just us (my brother and I) but I totally agree
offmychest,ffdbf5h,t3_esvl1h,1579817264.0,"I‚Äôve had employers to my face ask me the most basic questions that are on the resume right in their hands, I agree the expectations are skewed so much higher for applicants than employers when really it is a fair trade in the end."
childfree,fdbqy5o,t3_ekif88,1578260491.0,"Yeah I think it‚Äôs because since kids are such a huge time and money sink becoming a parent just turns into a huge/main personality trait for a lot of them. I would never want my life to alter in that way, that drastically lol"
Anxiety,fcwipo9,t3_ej29di,1578026688.0,"I work about 25 hrs while in university full time and volunteering, so I think I kind of get what that‚Äôs like. Sometimes I‚Äôm working so much I literally don‚Äôt even feel like myself when I‚Äôm off. I‚Äôm just dead tired and sleepy and thinking about whatever else it is I gotta do next. I don‚Äôt really have any solace because I think that‚Äôs just how it is if anyone wants to be financially stable/independent lol, unfortunately"
relationships,fcmofzf,t1_fcmod4m,1577784284.0,"Yeah I am wearing kind of thin at this point. A big part of it is I know this is doing bad things to her already low self-esteem plus the fact it‚Äôs morally wrong, but at some point maybe there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it :/"

dating_advice,far4rf7,t1_far49bh,1576312133.0,I didn‚Äôt literally mean I‚Äôm gonna ask ‚Äúwhat are we‚Äù with those exact words but rather ask what he thinks the relationship is or what he wants the relationship to be at this point. I like him a lot and want a serious relationship with him but do not want to corner or pressure him into anything
dating_advice,far3jw3,t3_eaghwv,1576311729.0,"If you‚Äôre not feeling it you‚Äôre not feeling it and there doesn‚Äôt have to be a justifiable reason other than your personal feelings. You‚Äôre doing yourself and the other person a disservice by making yourself date them, pickiness is subjective and there‚Äôs no right or wrong amount of it to have because only you know what would make you happy"

birthcontrol,faghb7t,t3_e92hm4,1576054874.0,I‚Äôm on Lo Loestrin Fe which is the lowest dosage of hormones available on the market! For that reason getting side effects is statistically less likely
