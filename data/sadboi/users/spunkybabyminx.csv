I have a bf I have been feeling this way for about two weeks since we had an argument and he got to say all he wanted and the next day act like none of it didn't happen or play it off. I was feeling like ok until he just quit talking through things and wants to go back to normal. I however kept it all in to be the bigger person you know? But now im hella resentful and it hurts and I'm sad and mad about it. I also don't sleep well so I just wake up 2 hours before my alarm. I took a shower and cried it out a bit but now I'm pissed and crying. Sleeping on the couch just to feel like there's someone there. I hope your situation improves and the other person understands or at least hears you out."

You matter, you are loved, take deep breaths, its ok to cry it out in the shower a little but don't let it continue to take over your day you know? Set an alarm so you wake up at the same time, right now you need hugs and a routine set up so you have some control over something even if you don't have control of yourself.

Blind,fbbzzgq,t3_ecjd24,1576712320.0,"Hello from Southern California. My husband has Pigmentosa he has grown up having it since he was about 11 or 12 she has had other things happen as far as PTSD causing events in his life. But he says that going blind is one of the scariest things that he has ever done. And he also states that he is also very very alone and angry. I have suggested counseling or therapy for him since I really don't know how to help him much anymore cuz it's getting worse. My suggestion is to talk to everyone around you and just explain how your eyes are doing and where you're at and what you would like for them to do as in letting you be a little more independent or in what areas you would like help in. He has refused therapy for a long time he is just now coming around to it and he is 40 we have four kids together from previous marriages you should be proud that you're actively seeking help as far as therapy and realize that yes there are a lot of visually impaired people out there. I will try to look for a support group around you also look into your States disabilities benefits. My husband has had came training and they also offer other classes as in how to use your phone because that is a big one for him. I ramble sorry. The main point being. Yes you are totally ok in feeling scared/angry/depressed ect just don't let it take over. ALWAYS ASK FOR HELP. You are not a burden if you say please and thank you (it can get frustrating not doing things for yourself and manners seem to be forgotten) Be safe, don't be stubborn and I really hope they can figure out how to help you. :)"

Through ADA therapy 2 times a week for 3 hours a session he has somewhat learned after he does something the other person or persons don't like or fit the social norm to stop and breath and rewind if you would and think about why the other person would be upset. He then ""knows"" and apologizes but not really ""getting"" it completely its been 4 years and he slowly has come around but it's not natural for him. It helps that the therapy sessions are at home and they create an ""issue"" like loosing at a board game and show him the proper response."

Blind,f9ldugp,t3_e5or3r,1575420673.0,I am so sorry to hear you went through that. My husband has RP and we have had similar instances with doctors he has gotten to the point where you just doesn't want to go anymore. They always tell him there are no cures right now and they can't really do anything for him either. A couple doctors have cried so I think part of it might be that they just want to be callous about it even though they don't understand how hard it is to lose something so important to life quality. If you can't I would suggest finding another doctor and explain everything that has gone on and you can ask all your questions but it may take time to get there. For now try to remind yourself it will be okay

He still has some vision but also worries he is a burden. I suggest counseling for sure. Maybe even family  a support group so they can maybe help understand more. There are a lot of you guys out there its just hard to find each other. Depending on the state they will give you training and someone to help with cane training which I suggest you start. The sooner the better. My husband waited to long and it's a big adjustment. 

It is scary. Don't stop learning and always, always ask for help."

He hates half open doors and yea moving things around is the worst we have 4 kids and it took a while for them to understand that leaving things around on the ground or cupboards half can hurt.  My husband has RP so he has like some tiny amount ""vision"" it's not like our vision and it kind of helps but also gives him a false sense of security. He wears hats to help with hitting his face on things, we were talking about making some sort of chinguard socks that aren't too thick but enough to not cause big gashes or bumping things that horrible."
Blind,f55yst7,t1_f55wfug,1572015893.0,"No problem :) 

A few other things I remember, salads are his favorite thing at the moment so I make different ones, chinese chicken, grilled chicken, steak, he will even add rice to it to kind clump things together, hot dogs, steak sandwhiches, he also does alot of sandwhiches andnthe cool part is you can change things up and he wont get tired of it. 

He will almost always use a bowl because he can scrape the bottom and scoop up the last bites. He does spill drinks or drop things from time to time. We don't make a big deal because we get it but he worries everyone saw it to which I reply does it matter if you can't see them? Haha 

Just keep things light, he is still the same person just with different abilities sometimes we even joke about it. I remind my husband that everyone has different abilities and disabilities and we are there to help or direct him in the right direction. 

Please remind everyone to introduce themselves  and tell him if they are leaving the room or get up and let him know if they are leaving for good or whatnot. Thats my husbands biggest gripe. It gets lonely even around loved ones. Just listen and give support which looks like you are doing well there. 
Good job. :)"
Blind,f55irlm,t3_dmti8g,1572008227.0,"Finger foods lile pizza, sandwhiches, soup with a spoon of course, tacos ect. 

My husband hates it as well so I have learned a few things. He likes salads in a bowl. I usually give him a bowl when I serve him food. I will toss the salad or cut up meats and he is ok to fork around and the food wont fall off the plate. I also male alot of stir fry and things that can be mixed and or smaller pieces. 

The clock method works for the most part. Once things get mixed around it can get confusing so I just make things that can be mixed together. 

I will ask more when he wakes up. :) 

I hope any of this helps!"

  Learn all you can now. Get a job you love and you could do should your vision worsen. Get some new skills your right eye being the way it is it wouldn't hurt. Stay calm. I know its hard right now.
We can't control the future and that sucks. You can however control how you see it even if say you did lose more vision. There are many people who will help and the resources! So many! I know so many  blind/ VI people that are just happy to be living life independently which is way easier now.  I know it can be done. You just get to experience life differently and whose to say we all see it the same anyways? 

For now, just take 10 deep breaths and try to relax.  :)
