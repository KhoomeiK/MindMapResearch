if you think it's less important to focus on the diversity of one's social circle than the quality of it, then i guess you won't have any problem here.

>What's not fair is expecting everyone else to stop existing because you refuse to take responsibility for your own life and happiness.

Again, you totally get it wrong. Antinatalism does not expect everyone else to stop existing. In fact, antinatlists advocate for more attention on the well-being of existing people through means such as adoption, rather than breeding, which very much align with the philosophy of veganism.

And I feel like if you're already familiar with Sam's podcasts and related intellectuals like Rob Reid, Sean Carrol, and Don Hoffman, etc it's a pretty introductory book to conscious and doesn't really offer many thought-provoking ideas."
samharris,fjkr5er,t3_fdv7su,1583432262.0,what's up with all these posts about what Sam liked on twitter? are you a twitter police?

Pessimism,fjcl8ny,t1_fj9i2a5,1583224942.0,Right. Thanks for elaborating.
Pessimism,fj9hdyj,t3_fbtu8p,1583148511.0,">These works think, each in their own way, through a way of understanding life that is neither anthropomorphic or anthropocentric, nor misanthropic.

samharris,fj35fku,t3_fawzjz,1582968200.0,"Seems no one is bringing this up...Haven't looked into it but I'm very curious how studies can control ""parenting"" or even define it methodologically. You have so many confounding variables and surely problematic parenting styles (like child abuse or neglect) matter a lot? Or they simply rule out these ""extreme"" cases?"
Pessimism,fj354pa,t3_fb28cp,1582967753.0,"I wish I had read this earlier! I was just writing an essay on the concept of 'sustainable development' since in the past three decades there were lots of debates about its emphasis on 'needs' and how that moved us away from radical green thoughts. This is how SD was defined: ""Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""
