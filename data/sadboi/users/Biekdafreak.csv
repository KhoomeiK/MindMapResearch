**The** [**GAINSWave**](https://gainswave.com/) **procedure breaks up plaque formation in blood vessels and stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in the penis. This increases the blood flow to the penis and improves sexual function. In addition, the GAINSWave procedure activates the growth of new nerve tissue in the penis.**

**This process, called neurogenesis, enhances sensitivity in the penis. Because GAINSWave uses low-intensity sound waves and is non-invasive, it is often referred to as Low-Intensity Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (LI-ESWT).**"

Sorry I can’t reply sooner I have to wait 6 minutes between posts.   See if you can get him to take a drug test.  See what his reaction is.  Just be careful he could get defensive. Also on meth you tend you overact to things that normally wouldn’t bother you. And you interpret things that people say to be negative when it wasn’t said that way.  Lots of paranoia.  That’s a lot of weight loss. And if his pupils are dilated that’s a tell tale sign.  Check his blood pressure too.  A lot of grocery stores have blood pressure machines.

The blood which has meth is being passed through your organs and causing damage it it. Your kidney is responsible for cleaning toxins from your blood which is why I developed chronic kidney disease. The damage it does to you brain is why I developed schizophrenia.  It damages your
Nervous system as well putting your sympathetic nervous into over drive. You’re constantly in fight or flight mode, not sleeping and eating and drinking enough fluids makes all this worse and makes it harder for your body to do what it’s designed to do.

I’ve found other substances that improve my sex life now and being fit and healthy and in shape I’m able to enjoy it more and not risk cardiac arrest for how hard id go on meth. Meth is a vasoconstrictor so it narrows your blood vessels and causes your heart to pump harder to get the blood circulated throughout your body. Your body temperature rises, you stop producing saliva which is why your teeth start to rot because saliva help fight bacteria in your mouth and when that’s gone the bacteria and the chemicals in the meth start to erode the enamel and eventually your teeth. That’s why people get meth mouth and brushing your teeth does nothing but prolong the inevitable which is that your teeth will decay no matter what your brushing habits are. Not to mention the lifestyle and the people who do that are typically not good people to be around, you can’t trust anyone, people lie cheat and steal. There’s lots of unprotected sex going on with multiple partners who are all using and have compromised immune systems so std’s and uti’s are super common."
