When I have had really bad bottom dysphoria, it‚Äôs so painful to me and if I was having that every day, as I do with my chest, I would definitely consider having phallo. But it‚Äôs only happened to me like twice in the past 5 years of being out and it only ever has lasted a few hours. 

If someone needs phallo, that‚Äôs their need and no one else should butt into it. Honestly I commend you for being able to go through with a surgery that will take so much recovery and pain.

Because I had to stay quiet about things in the religion I was raised and in my household, my BPD is quiet BPD. Only a few people have ever triggered aggressiveness with me, and it‚Äôs usually  only out of fear for myself and trying to get out of the situation that scares me, that I become aggressive. 

I think the stereotypical difference in how women are raised vs men are raised and the way that affects BPD development is why there‚Äôs the stereotype of symptoms for both genders.

The more you pull away from someone with BPD when they are being dependent on you, the more manipulative and shitty things end up being unless they are able to check themselves. It escalates excessively if the person doesn't realize that they're being shitty and they often play themselves out as either the one 100% in the right or the victim. 

You were right to end the relationship and you are right to not put up with that level of manipulation. I hope you are able to recover from the relationship and be able to trust people again. I don't blame you if you have a bad taste in your mouth about people with BPD, it's hard to not have that when you have been hurt so badly by someone with it.

I had this problem with my ex. Thankfully not to the extent that you experienced, however I started being manipulative and guilt tripping him for not being on calls with me (It was long distance and that made my reactions even worse). We broke up and are friends now, but it took me two weeks of overreactions after the breakup before I could talk to him again. 

Thankfully my therapy and the work I have done on myself in the two months since has incredibly helped me and changed the way that I react to things. However I had to want to do it on my own and not have anyone else as the driving force behind everything that I was doing for myself. 

I'm moving in with him and some friends soon and 6 months ago, that would not have been a viable option for me because my emotions were to volatile. Now we're just gonna be a bunch of nerdy guys sharing a house. 

I  hope that your ex can get better and treat herself and those in her life with more respect instead of manipulating and sabotaging out of fear. I'm sorry you were hurt so badly.

I still have the records and I enjoy them, but I would not have spent $30 on a Led Zep record without the driving force of being like Dean.

When I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, many of the questions specifically asked about me being happy in the gender I present as and if I'm happier than I was in the gender assigned at birth. Most focused on that and not as much on the discomfort of my birth gender. Which even if they did, a disconnect can still be classified as discomfort. 

Some people only feel gender euphoria to the gender they identify with and a disconnect to their birth gender. That can still medically be classified as gender dysphoria. However many people that feel that way do not feel as though that is dysphoria and do not like claiming it is when it is not a specific discomfort and hate that many trans people  define as gender dysphoria.

massage,foqafjc,t1_fopuniw,1587988391.0,"This is a pandemic. It‚Äôs a virus that our bodies are not used to. Many people are at risk of this disease and could die if they get it. If the US had parameters to help pandemics (which Trump gutted a while ago) we would all likely be doing fine, along with the economy doing fine. 

If we go back to work too early we‚Äôre gonna end up like New York or Italy where our healthcare system is overwhelmed- which is the biggest problem with a pandemic. If there are too many people who are gravely ill to fit in the hospitals, then more people will end up dying. Flattening the curve so that our healthcare system is not overwhelmed is incredibly important. Doing anything else is literally a death sentence to some people. Yes, most people won‚Äôt die from it, but we need to do this for the people who are at risk and for our healthcare providers. 

Some of your information is correct, however a lot of it is mislead. There is a lot of misinformation going around- I know I probably believe something about it that is misinformation because I haven‚Äôt heard otherwise. 

We don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed a vaccine to be safe‚Äù but a vaccine will save the lives of a lot of people who are at risk. Masks helps to prevent the spreading if you are sick and because the coronavirus can be asymptomatic it‚Äôs a good idea for everyone to wear a mask- however, yes some people have restrictions on their breathing that make it so they can‚Äôt. Doctor‚Äôs offices are empty because people are doing telehealth and while some surgeons are out of work due to their surgeries being ‚Äúelective‚Äù most other healthcare workers are actually working more hours. People are being counted as dying from the coronavirus by being diagnosed with their symptoms, which is how most diagnoses happen anyway. It‚Äôs being done that way because a lot of people can‚Äôt afford going to the hospital or the hospitals are full, not because they‚Äôre just counting everyone as ‚Äúyou died from the coronavirus.‚Äù They also just don‚Äôt have enough tests to test dead people. Someone in Utah even had the coronavirus and died from something else and she was not counted in the death count for Utah. 

If you look up the Spanish Flu pandemic from the early 1900s, the second wave was more deadly than the first and that‚Äôs what could happen with the coronavirus if we are not careful with how we react. People moving around (which can happen much faster now) accelerated the spreading and the disease ended up mutating and taking younger and healthier victims. Nearly 200,000 people died in one month in just the US.
Historians and doctors say that it ended up killing people because there was no quarantine due to it being wartime and the government deciding that it needed factory workers now more than it needed living people later. 

We shouldn‚Äôt make the same mistake twice. Being careful and putting off going back to work til it really feels safe is important. Being cautious even when you do go back to work is even more important. 

It‚Äôs better to be more cautious than less cautious. 

(I am also very tired so if I made any mistakes I am sorry and will correct them if they are pointed out to me)"

I think it has to do with processing and getting over things and your brain gets hung up emotionally on every little thing because it could bring something else into play and you don't want to get blindsided. However, mulling over the same thing ends up getting you blindsided in the present anyway."
BPD,fonsp2k,t3_g8ftns,1587925705.0,"I am sorry for your loss, just know that it isn't your fault. BPD is really hard to deal with even as someone who is pretty functional. I've contemplated suicide many times and I only haven't done it because of luck and being able to know when I'm in a precarious position and get help quickly. I think most of us who are still alive are alive because of luck. 

I don't know for sure when I started my BPD symptoms, but I started dissociating from a young age and having heavy anxiety. My anxiety likely started around the age of 6, when I had a traumatic experience that I didn't remember til I had PTSD-like flashbacks this January. 

I grew up in a Mormon military household. My brother was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy when he was 5 and we were told he would only live til he was 16. This made it so that I was constantly waiting for something bad to happen. Between being moved away from friends every 1-4 years (usually about 2), and my brother steadily getting worse physically and mentally, every new thing seemed bad. I also was one of the middle children of 4. My older sister was treated differently cause she was older, my brother treated differently because of his disability and my younger sister treated differently because of her being the youngest. I was neglected, without my parents meaning to neglect me. They mostly were trying to deal with my brother's disability and everything surrounding that because there were many, many death scares over the years. 

However, I dissociated so I saw everything as rose colored and good. I tried to stay positive and push down all my feelings of negativity because my mind knew that it would overwhelm me at the age that I was at. My mom took me to doctors, wondering why I wasn't processing things like normal and why I was so distractable, but they just said ""oh, he's a kid. It's fine""   
Once I got to age 15, my BPD became more apparent. I was still reacting like a kid emotionally, even though my mind is pretty logical. My emotions became so strong that they overwhelmed me to a point that I couldn't function. I was told that I had anxiety and depression by my therapists.   
My parents grounded me heavily while I was in high school to a point where I didn't think there was any point and ended up getting more depressed. When I was 16 I did online school. When I was 17 I ended up being sent to a wilderness program because I was suicidal and had cut myself for the first time.   
When I was 18 I realized I didn't believe the church that I grew up in, and I felt betrayed. I also came out that year and ended up having mental abuse from much of my family. Some even going as far as to call me a sexual predator for being queer and trans (FTM). 

I didn't get a proper diagnosis til last June when I was 22. I was scared when I was diagnosed because I had a doctor before (super religious) who said that me being LGBT+ was just because I had a personality disorder. However, since I was diagnosed I have had significant improvement. To a point that I don't dissociate anymore. I am really overwhelmed all the time, but I'm taking time for myself when I'm overwhelmed and I'm noticing my limits and processing through things. My therapist has said that I've made significant improvement in just the 3 months that I've been going to him for EMDR. 

I think my biggest reason I've gotten better is because I have looked at other people with BPD and am like ""I don't want to be like that."" I found out that this girl that was my friend hits her boyfriend when she's in her blinding anger moods and I know that I could get like that, because I almost have. My mom's mom was an alcoholic and an abuser due to her BPD, so I check my alcohol intake and my anger excessively. I have been manipulative and abusive and shitty before, but looking at others has made me realize what I was doing and how I've been hurting people.   
I also have realized that I want more for myself in my life. I'm able to have a good life and I am a good person, even if my mind wants me to think otherwise. That realization only happened in the past month and I'm a lot happier because of it. 

Sorry for posting such a novel, I haven't written this all out before. I hope this helped somewhat, though I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for."
FTMMen,fok4flb,t3_g7vxje,1587835221.0,"I recommend massage therapy to help with the problem, it can loosen up the muscles that tighten due to binding (pecs, trapezius, rhomboids, etc) and make it so those muscles don‚Äôt pull on your bones and cause damage. 

Since being a massage therapist and getting regular massage, my back and shoulders hurt, but not as much and it‚Äôs more just soreness as opposed to actual pain. 

The only problem is that you /have/ to get pec massage for binding and that can be dysphoria inducing, even if someone works above where the fat is (basically how I have to work on someone afab unless I have a written release from them to work lower on their chest). However it‚Äôs so insanely helpful that I think it‚Äôs worth it and if you can find a trans massage therapist that‚Äôs also helpful.

Honestly I probably would have a better relationship with my ex if we tried now, but I‚Äôve very much moved on. 

What‚Äôs really important is setting clear boundaries. Tell her when you need to be alone and say that you‚Äôll text her back or hang out with her after your alone time. If you‚Äôre upfront about your boundaries and what you need, you will have a lot more success.

2. If someone makes you uncomfortable you are allowed to step out of the room and refuse to see them again. Some employers are better about being supportive of this than others. 
I know some people I work with don‚Äôt report some creepy things because the person comes to them consistently and tips well. 

3. Pay can be a problem because if you work at an establishment that isn‚Äôt your own, your pay can depend heavily on tips.

massage,fmkngjv,t3_fviear,1586161238.0,"You may have held a lot of your stress and fear in that area and releasing the areas where you hold emotion, releases that emotion. 
I actually had PTSD flashbacks consistently for a week after one of the massages I had in January, because she released the areas I had held that fear in. 

When I was first learning about it in school, I was skeptical, but after a lot of experience, it‚Äôs definitely something that can easily happen. Especially with chronic muscle pain and a traumatic past, because those two are usually linked. When you get scared you tense up a certain way and if you keep tensing up that way, it just holds your fear.

BorderlinePDisorder,fmdz9ry,t3_fugcv3,1585983086.0,"So, I was diagnosed last June. I had just finished massage school, but didn't get a spa job til the end of November. So I worked fast paced jobs for a bit after my diagnosis they were stressful, but made dissociating a common coping mechanism for me.   
Once I started the massage job and was able to slow down and focus on my therapy while also being able to perform well in my career. Since slowing down and focusing on getting better, I have gone from dissociating all the time, to basically never dissociating.   
This made things harder for a time. I couldn't control my impulses, my emotions were stronger and I didn't know how to deal with them.  However, I have- with two therapists and determination- started to be able to control them now. 

I have one regular therapist, I mostly talk about everyday problems with her- though the further I get into therapy, the less I need to talk about with my therapist for day to day things- cause I've been able to process them on my own. Then I have my EMDR therapist who helps me through the past and the reasoning behind my behaviors. My EMDR therapist has helped me be able to break down a lot of core beliefs I had that perpetuated not great behaviors and is now helping me build my core beliefs into more healthy ideas.  


Honestly, while going through this therapy so far, some of my borderline symptoms got the worst that they have ever been before. However it was like a lashing out before the behavior really shrunk and has become the easiest it ever has been to control.   
I really have started to like myself and feel good and confident about decisions that I'm making. I can process things on my own now because my mind isn't stuck on still processing the past. You may start to get worse before you get better, but please don't give up at that point. It's trying to pull you out of getting better.

I've actually started to get better and not want the adrenaline rush as I've felt better about myself, my needs and my relationships with other people.
