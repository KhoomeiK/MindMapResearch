Yeah they both suck bad. I wanted Bernie. 

But the sad truth is people stand behind a parties ideology. Not necessarily the figure heads. 

From what I have learned and seen:
Trump has exhausted every safety measure for the economy BEFORE covid hit. Now the rates are so low we have no leverage there. We are losing billions in lost tax revenue. But the money that companies saved on taxes are no longer there because of quarantine. Not that they properly invested them to workers anyway.

I work at a bank. The regulations that our CEO blasted every year after the great recession.. are why I still have a job today. And I quote from higher execs, ""these regulations are why we are very well positioned right now"". No layoffs at my bank. At least yet.

So for whatever reason you and people  like trump/Biden, it's unfortunate, but the ideology underneath does not change.

I believe in prochoice, trickle UP economics, and other social issues. Trump does not. So I am stuck with this less than ideal candidate who does. 

However I believe many trump supporters just blindly follow and praise him without critical thoughts I have for Biden."
