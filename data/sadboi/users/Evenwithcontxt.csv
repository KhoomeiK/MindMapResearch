wow,foummz2,t3_g9ov97,1588086816.0,"Depends on what you enjoy when it comes to WoW.  Are you wanting to mythic raid?  Probably wouldn't be too possible with only 10 hours to play a week with all the catch-up you'd have to do.

Everything else though is really just subjective on whether or not you'd enjoy it based off time restraints.  Everybody has a 100% exp buff till the SL prepatch so if you enjoy leveling alts then now is the time to hop in."
CompetitiveWoW,fouht8t,t1_fotycwt,1588084325.0,"You don't really ever want to cast FoL or Holy light at all while raiding as glimmer paladin.  

The main priorties should always look something like this:

Holy Shock > Crusader Strike > Light of Dawn > Flash of Light in case of emergency (I.E. Tanks) > Holy light as filler 

On your best pull, 6:23s at 1%, Xelitt had 91 out of 132 casts of HS, and **27 out of 112** possible CS casts.  Orben was somewhat similar with 67 out of 94 casts of HS, and **11 out of 110** possible CS casts.

This is definitely a major problem and as soon as they improve on keeping HS and CS off CD I guarantee they'll see significant improvement.

One other thing I noticed was they don't group their CDs.  When raiding as a Hpally you almost always want to group Wings and HA since they synergize very well with each other when using the glimmer build, however both seem to be staggering them and from the pulls I looked at it seems Orben could be using wings at the start and could still have it up by the time he actually uses it.

Ideally one of them uses their wings/ha at start, and the other uses theirs 30-45s later then they both just use them off CD from there.  They could both use them at the start but I feel it'd be better for them to alternate being gods for 20-30s.

Lastly, your healer's DPS overall could improve, but I think it'd be best to have them tighten up their healing rotation before worrying too much about that."
CompetitiveWoW,fotvsm6,t3_g8v7o9,1588067903.0,"I second 4 healing.  In Mythic there are some fights where overhealing will generally be safer, however for fights like this having that one extra DPS will really help manage the adds better and will make the fight less hectic overall for your healers.  

Not to mention it looks to be a snorefest for them anyway and if they like any amount of challenge at all then I'm sure they'd love to 4 heal.

Also your HPallies are casting waaay too many holy lights and are missing out on so many HS casts by not keeping CS off CD."
