depression,f76h94v,t1_f76gf6h,1573427996.0,"I tried quite a few, had some bad reactions to a couple which was annoying cause it would be a waste of money. I don’t want to depend on medicine. The therapists I’ve had were honestly not the right fits for me at all. One loved to talk about herself the entire time, the others treated me like a fucking child which only pissed me off more.  I know I need to go back but then I keep thinking about how in a few months I want have insurance to see doctors anymore anyway, so what’s the point? 

I do work out, which I love but I’ve been thinking about boxing. I just don’t have the money right now since I’m continuously being screwed over by jobs lately. Just been a bad few months."

playstation,f6m4n95,t1_f6ll6mg,1572966554.0,"I did that too. I think it’s just taken a massive shit. It started up in safe mode randomly and said it couldn’t turn on, so I had to download the system software to a USB drive and manually reinstall the software like that. It was on and working, redownloading my games, then it froze and when it turned back on it did the same thing. So it’s just fucked I guess. 😞 I haven’t even had it for a year."

depression,f1jry0k,t1_f1j698e,1569527158.0,"Man.. I feel this one 100%. I guess I just assume that going on these nice trips and getting away from everyone/everything would take the sadness away but it doesn’t. It’s still there. So when I realize that, it just hits even harder. Ya know? It’s hard to enjoy things when you can’t feel pure joy."
depression,f0o5dvh,t1_f0o55ui,1568796251.0,"Ohh okay, I’m honestly not totally sure how all of that works since you are a minor but ya know i feel like if you just reached out for help how could they turn you away? 
You’re not a burden, you should not feel like that. Im sure it’s hard because you’re father was probably raised differently than you and because of you’re religion but I bet he doesn’t want to lose you. 
Im here if you need to talk, I’m sure you’ve got the number for the suicide hotline as well. Or you can talk to them online, maybe they will have more answers about medical care you can receive as a minor without parental consent? 
I hope everything works out for you!"
depression,f0o4gmu,t3_d5trst,1568794649.0,"If you don’t mind me asking, are you over 18? I understand that your families beliefs may be different but I honestly think that you need to do whatever is best for you. If you feel that you need help and you’re scared of what will happen if you don’t get some, then you should definitely try. Possibly your family will be upset but hopefully in time they will realize that is what you had to do. Even if not, hopefully you’ll still get the help that you need in order to cope with everything. 
Im sorry you’re feeling the way you are, I can honestly relate and I know it’s so hard. But I promise you, getting help can be worth it especially when there’s people involved that you want to live for."

But, I guess I just feel lost? Or like that there is no one who is truly there for me or loves me for who I really am. Ya know?"

depression,ezfqn3q,t1_ezfq9lx,1567881840.0,"I really hope you find this helpful in healing! I’m sure your dad and brother want to see you do amazing things. It’s awful and it’s heartbreaking, but for me it was a huge reality check that I used them to fuel me into a more positive lifestyle. Just try to sit down and think of things you can do that you know they would be sitting by your side cheering you on."
depression,ezfpbgm,t3_d0ws7w,1567881093.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through all of that. That’s a lot that has been put on you. I can relate in some ways, two years ago I lost two of my best childhood friends exactly two weeks apart. It was so hard to go through the process of grieving because I was grieving them both differently, but at the same time. One’s death made me more angry, ones death seemed unbelievable. You have to find a way to grieve them both and get through the steps of grieving in your own way. My relationships with people definitely changed around this time as well, I lost good friends and my job the following week. Shit can be real rough, but I promise you’ll get through it. One thing that pushed me forward in a positive way was to do something that would make my friends who passed proud. I would do good things knowing that if I told them, they would say “yes bitch! I’m proud of you!” And that pushed me through it a lot. 
Good luck. 💗"
depression,ezc9ioi,t3_cml6ni,1567831827.0,"I have not felt this out of control in a while. I thought I was doing much better with keeping my mood in check and handling things well. I mean, I’ve been feeling pretty down and worthless for a while but I was able to push through those thoughts. Now I feel like I am beginning to spiral out of control. I want to scream, break things, cry, disappear.. really anything to get all these emotions out. I feel so unloved. I mean, really fucking unloved. I feel angry, hurt and invisible. I’m trying so hard man.. but it always comes full circle back to feeling like this. 

P.s. In regards to “disappear” - I don’t mean that I want to die. For the first time in a long time, I’ve begun to realize that I want to live. But, I think maybe that’s the hard part too and what makes this pain feel a bit different than before? I realize that I’m stuck here.. going through these continuous waves of emotion and I just have to deal with it."
