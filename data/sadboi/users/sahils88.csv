Otherwise, I have never had any cop/park guard come and warn about this ever before. 

Interesting thing to note is that first came the cops who asked to maintain distance etc and did not say a thing about alcohol...we all had a can in hand. 

Then 15-20 mins later...came the park guards who warned us and groups around us regarding alcohol.

I understand you're consuming quality stuff and in turn having a higher bill and also shopping from a name brand store does add up. 

Also it can get confusing when you start adding non-perishable stuff to your grocery cost. My suggestion would be to order laundry, cleaning and non-perishables like pasta, rice, flour etc on a separate bill and keep a tab on that. 

That will give you a better picture of how much you both are spending on food. From their drill down and see if there is something you can ignore or substitute.

audiophile,fn8ii88,t1_fn8g66o,1586742425.0,"So I will comment based on my very limited knowledge base and my personal experience with these. 

I am not an audiophile in the sense that I understand all terminologies or even have deep of knowledge audio products.

However, I do believe I have a very keen ear, understand the science behind things and appreciate good sound , separation and purity of it. For e.g I love bass to be a natural extension of the sound and never be identified. I’ve heard about audio products and know somewhat of a history and it was my father who really made me identify good sound vs good ‘sounding’ sound (just made it up). 

The Kefs were advertised as TV speakers replacement and that’s not a lofty aim. When connected they sounded really good and detailed. However, the low end was terribly lacking (understandable from the design).  These speakers have the same frequency response as the T301 by KEF. A sub was truly missed. If someone just want better Tv sound, they could do much better with a 300$ sounding sound bar and sub offering. 

Then started my hunt for a sub and once connected, these speakers flourished. 

The sound is detailed, clear and very crisp. The low end is there where needed and my ears are genuinely happy. I’m trying to figure out how to place the sub to a spot I have identified optimal (the one pic is 80% there). 

But are these worth it? I truly do not know. While looking for sub I found superb deals on klipsch and other brands and might have picked up a good 5.1 system and a decent amp for maybe 150$ more than what I spent on the Kefs. 

But I didn’t want wires around my rental, my listening space is acoustically pathetic and not worth investing in, and I wanted a seamless and lesser headache system. 

So, given my requirement of a solid 2.1 setup on a budget and with possibility of upgrading (Albeit limited) in future makes these totally worth it. And the sound I am getting makes me love them all the more.  

Tl:dr - Totally worth the price for me. Look good, gels in well with the decor, easy to setup, sound great. Might not be best for a lot of us out there.

Edit: some specifics."
