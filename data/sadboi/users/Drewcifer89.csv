witchcraft,fb5z0tx,t1_fb5uja0,1576537338.0,"I agree. I mean, it’s all contextual at some point. I’m sure not many people would fault you for not included blondes in that hypothetical. As to your question, no, in my opinion, not everything has to include everyone. With safe spaces like gay or lesbian or black only bars or groups, it’s easy to see the point and reasons for their existence. And of course, the inevitable white pride months or straight pride parades ensue, which look similar on a surface level but are merely another attack on marginalized communities.

I’m assuming it’s more to what you say in the latter half. Whether intentional or not, I suppose the book must seem like a form of gatekeeping in and of itself, with its focus on vaginas attached to being a female witch. I don’t know, maybe the author had no ill will yet needs to explain herself better.

Probably preaching to the choir, but the way I see it, everything’s on a spectrum anyway, and everyone’s intersectionalities, environment, and experiences are going to be different. There are light skin and dark skin black people, masculine and feminine gays, cis and trans straight people. Race, gender, etc are societal constructs and *shouldn’t* matter. Binaries are almost always not when looked at from another perspective. I suppose I’ve studied too much Buddhism and have attempted to eradicate the idea of dualities and accept much that seems paradoxical. Of course, as you and I both know, the world at large sees some of our outward specific differences and jumps to conclusions from there.

It’s always a fine line to me: there’s my truth and perspective that we’re all the same and different at once, and then there’s the labels and mantles that society and even ourselves thrust upon us. Tools that can be useful, to either help or harm or both. I myself use them to identify myself to others; it makes things easier sometimes. It also highlights ways in which the world works against us and illuminates paths to greater understanding and solutions. Of course I’m going to be more sensitive and possibly critical towards things that relate to my specific circumstances, while I might overlook things that do not directly affect me.

One reads this, calls it TERFy. Someone else won’t. One person’s bigot is another’s person’s hero. People accuse me of being anti-straight every so often, just because they don’t like when I state how they can be and are oppressive to us, *in general*, an often neglected but important distinction to state, which many just assume one way or the other. I actually like to see things as usually somewhere in between super specific or general. I suppose the only way I can really determine my perspective on it is to read it myself, but I feel that’d be mostly a waste of time, since I’ve got an earthly expiration date.

(Except now I just really want to read the book to see what all the fuss is about lol)"

I’ve got a dick and mostly identify as a man, so I’ll take the word of others who can relate more.

I mean, being gay, it gets quite tiresome having straight people try to explain to me why something isn’t homophobic.

SelfAwarewolves,f9ofkhb,t1_f9ob4a8,1575503364.0,"Of course I’ve insulted someone, but I don’t blame that on anyone or anything besides myself.

Yes, I did know I was gay in 3rd grade, but I had no knowledge of a label to attach and no understanding from nearly everyone around me, like most of the community. Must have been nice to have a diagnosis, just like my undiagnosed bipolar. The comparison between gay, which then gets turned into faggot later, and nigger is just a distinction without a difference. Where does retard fall on your scale of insults? Probably higher than someone else’s. As you say, it’s a mindset, right?

Extenuating circumstances are literally about context. And law is literally the rules of society. It certainly has some bearing on more than 99% of what happens, whether you agree with it or not. The courts’ actual job they do every Mon-Fri is listen to details of individual cases. You obviously agree in this case, as you want to overcontexualize everything, so lucky you, the law is on your side. Too bad I never said that the law justified anything, since I was merely stating a legal term and idea, so I’ll just knock that straw man over.

Clearly our principles are different, even if you want to conjure up some Jungian ego theory to discredit me. It’s probably just my bipolar though or maybe because I’m gay and lacked attention as I’m also the youngest sibling. Who can tell? Your entire opinion is centered around yourself and not the actual people that might be harmed.

I’m also confused; you keep saying not to compare things to others but then you do. It’s almost like context goes both ways.

Racism is defined by words and actions, and people can perform racist acts unintentionally. It doesn’t lessen the harm to someone else. What is important after the fact is actually owning up to your mistake and giving a real apology, not just some empty social etiquette. Even better would be to then listen to the other person and how you harmed them. Not for you, but for them.

You’re the one who keeps saying I’m calling you racist when I’ve done no such thing. All I’ve said is the act is racist, your justifications do not make it not racist or not harmful, and you do have control over what you say, given all the contexts you’ve brought up. I’d love to see any kind of scientific evidence of muscle memory making you blurt out specific words.

 Besides, what are “actual racists”? Is it like a checkbox system with points? Is it some defining act, like physically assaulting someone? Do I need to lynch someone or put them in an oven? You should be familiar with the idea of spectrums, so try applying that to other contexts. You can do something racist to any degree and not be a racist, according to many people’s perspective, including mine. You’re playing apologetics, like someone trying to defend their racist, homophobic, ableist grandfather for all his bullshit because “he just grew up that way!” If you are an adult, then recognize your own actions for what they are and take responsibility for them."

Do I let them continue doing it? No. The legal term you’re trying to describe is extenuating circumstances, which only change the severity of the sentencing. They do not provide a defense.

You didn’t say that you said it to yourself, unless you’ve edited it since. You said sometimes/usually. So looks like you’re changing the narrative. Doesn’t really matter, doesn’t change the point.
