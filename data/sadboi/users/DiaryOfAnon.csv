Go research that and you'll find your answer. And Hillary did not ""crush"" Bernie. Are you serious?"
politics,fjfsmx2,t1_fjfre9m,1583299171.0,Blindly following corrupt DNC party leaders does not make me a liberal. I am a liberal based on my progressive values. I refuse to support someone who is staunchly against those values. Debbie Wasserman rigged the last election. I won't accuse Tom Perez of anything YET but I wouldn't be surprised if he followed suit. I refuse to fall in line behind such corruption.

relationship_advice,f9dcxht,t3_e4eiez,1575232338.0,"Downvote me to hell but as a person with major depression, you can't make someone want to live. You can't force them to be interested in wanting to live either. Sure you can remove their ability to harm themselves but imagine keeping you son who is suffering for years in long term care, where he doesnt have the means to end his life but consistently had the desire but no ability to do so. Maybe thats seems helpful to you but that is not. You son is a minor so give him all the help he can get but once he is in adulthood his life is in his own hands and he has the right to choose what to do with it."
AmItheAsshole,f8qzevf,t3_c1v0sm,1574728076.0,Stong and easy YTA. You kicked your son out beacuse he wasn't the person you wanted him to. Not beacuse he was stealing your stuff or anything immoral. Who knows how defeated your son may have been feeling and may having been using video games etc to cope. You kicked him out to teach him some sort of lesson but thats shitty of you as a parent. Im not going to bother going into the things that good parenting but ehat you did is not it.

AskReddit,ev71oz0,t3_cif95z,1564254108.0,I started to personify god. I statted thinking about the all powerful nature of god and its all knowing intellect. It made me realize if you have all the power in the universe to make existence as perfect as you want and this is what you choose then god must be cruel. It wasnt a matter or losing faith more so god losing the worthiness of my praise and adoration.
AmItheAsshole,es0g05l,t3_c50s4i,1561474408.0,"Hm. While I do agree it is ypur money and you can use it as you see fit, I think this is very telling of how you view your stepchild. You yourself said the public high schools in the area aren't very good. Why not pay for the school as you had already been doing and just make it known that An has to figure out childcare on her own. I want to refrain for passing too much judgement but this seems selfish and very controlling to me but, again it is your money and you can do with it as you choose.

You also can't make An terminate her pregnancy, that will have to her and the father of the baby's choice. If you think teen parents are vulnerable then you have neglected to look at the support that An will need going forward. Teen moms risk not finishing school. I assume parents want whats best for their children and sure An didnt make the best of choices and she should know the consequences of that, but why not let her bear the burden of motherhood if she so chooses and you bear the burden of parenthood (paying for your child's High school education). YTA here."
