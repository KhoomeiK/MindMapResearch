medical,fm8mlqv,t1_fm2j5x8,1585852117.0,"I had an Rh incompatibility when I was born. You can get shots now, but my dad was adopted and the check ups were all fine and/or it wasn't as common to get them in the 80s. (Dunno about that last one)

So, I was born and wouldn't make red blood cells/our blood mixed/whatever; Rh blood types are weird so they needed a specific kind of donor. This was in 1987 when HIV/AIDS was becoming a pandemic. We lived in Houston which has a well-known queer-friendly community/neighborhood and there wasn't any kind of testing like we have now.

My parents owned pro shops in bowling alleys and a married couple started calling everyone and their mom in. She vetted people and the husband, who had JUST bought a brand new van, drove folks to get tested for ~12 hours. 

They couldn't find anyone and there wasn't anything they could do; the husband realized he hadn't been tested for a transfusion and he was the match. However, it didn't take like they wanted and my cell count kept dropping. They again said it was over, so Mom took me and my older brother home with the promise she'd be back in the morning. If it happened, she wanted to be at home.

So, they come back in the morning and everyone's on first-name basis by now. Doctor takes mom and brother into their office while nurses take me into the back to have my stuff checked. Mom just hears screaming and literally fell out of her chair; the doctor caught my year-old brother. All levels were normal, everything was fine. 

So a few years ago, I had the ridiculous exhaustion, felt like garbage, and had bruises all up and down my legs that I only noticed when my roommate saw them and went, ""Holy shit, what happened to your legs? Were you in an accident?"" Couldn't get an appointment with a GP for nearly a month; my mom stroked out and has Alzheimer's now. She was doing better then so I didn't tell them so as not to worry - she also had cancer before having us.

Very long answer to short question, but that's it. :)

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk."

I had a somewhat similar experience. I was born with a blood disorder that's fine now, but I was experiencing the symptoms of anemia, iron deficiency, which are also similar to leukemia. At one point I slept 30 hours. At another I slept 20 after taking 30 mg of adderall and chugging a monster. 

I also have your symptoms, down to no moons - but that comes and goes, so idk what that's about. 

They did ALL the tests. My vitamin levels were 1/4 of what they should be and basically had no vitamin  d. If you're able, try to get in depth blood work but I'd add in some slow release iron and vit d for now and see. I'm starting to feel wonky again but my diet sucks; def need more veggies"

Thank you so very much for your thoughts! That's a great idea.

I'm not necessarily embarrassed, but I do suffer from depression for which I see a therapist. Of course, the stigma re mental health is... well... mental (especially in offices I've worked which deal with physical health???) 

I'd usually just say, ""I need to leave early today, can I truncate/skip lunch?"" or something along those lines. If I think it's going to bite me, I'll have an informal ""slip"" where I mention it and that usually takes care of things."

I worked for a VERY small company in an HR role. I flagged on the drug screening due to my adderall but it turned out fine, of course. I don't believe anyone ever asked me what it was, but during my tenure the CEO would often ask if I knew about/if someone ""really"" had XYZ condition - or he would demand docs that the person did, indeed, need PTO for the doctor and a diagnosis. 

He also attempted to make me shut down employees discussing pay and I looked him deadpan in the eye and said, ""That's totally, 1,000% illegal. You can't do that and I won't."" Needless to say, I was on his radar after that, which was fine. He ran it horribly and our turnover was something like 80% when he took over, whereas it was ~15% previously."

legaladvice,ffu4p4x,t3_ev84y6,1580234432.0,"NAL  - based on personal experience as I'm prescribed meds for adhd and anxiety which are scheduled. The insurance should cover the rx bc the Dr should write a different number of pills which makes it a ""new"" rx, not a refill. It's possible the mgr is covering for someone/took it themselves depending on how sought after it is. There's also a def chance it was put into someone else's order/bag. Sometimes I get my meds in multiple bags bc I'll have a refill sent by Dr but will wait a few days as my other meds aren't due for refill yet and don't want to make a bunch of trips. 

That said, can I ask why it took at least four days to notice such a discrepancy in the bottle? By looking at it, it should be obvious that 2/3 of it are missing.
