raisedbynarcissists,fqxqqs6,t3_gl32t9,1589736416.0,"Yes. It‚Äôs tough but try and remind yourself in the bad times that at your core there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. Take the trauma and see it as something. That has been done to you. You are not broken just need to heal. It takes time and the fact that sometimes you feel like you will heal and grow shows progress- it‚Äôs not an easy feat but will be worth it. 

Hope that makes sense x"
raisedbynarcissists,fqun65q,t1_fquh92y,1589661565.0,"Yep you really hit the nail on the head there. I remember the moment I ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù I was at college with my friend just telling her somethings my mom said to me (which weren‚Äôt nice but at the time I thought normal) and she was SHOOK then I started reevaluating and I was like oh my lord. 

Everything from before I moved out is a blur most of it is still blocked out and the things that did happen that really ducked me up don‚Äôt even feel that long ago but also do. It‚Äôs a weird feeling 


It‚Äôs also taken me a really long time to accept that I am a victim and not just over sensitive as my parents told me. 

Toxic thoughts come from toxic people enbedding them in your brain so it‚Äôs like we really have to pull all the wires out and put them back in the right way but getting them tangled for years while doing it. That‚Äôs how I think of it anyway üòÇ"
raisedbynarcissists,fqubtv8,t3_gky9ck,1589655929.0,Yep indeed. And esp over the past four years since I‚Äôve moved out I‚Äôve been like pulling out all their shit and almost raising myself again

prozac,fhywbo3,t3_f5gd6t,1581985249.0,Yesss! I went from up to 150mg of Zoloft to starting on 20mg of Prozac. It made me feel more myself than in a long time. I have more energy and am much less foggy now.
prozac,fhor8il,t3_f473cq,1581770688.0,Yay so happy for you. I‚Äôve been on Prozac for over a month but still waiting for that.
ptsd,fhor5o3,t3_f44qcr,1581770592.0,Same. By nature I‚Äôm a very tolerant and considerate person (or at-least I like to think) but I also get these bouts of everything someone does DRIVES ME INSANE like just want to hide and ignore everyone. Makes me feel awful bc I know it‚Äôs not what the persons doing for the most part it‚Äôs my brain

ptsd,fgpcmsw,t3_ez88io,1581002073.0,I only realised I had been sexually abused as a child by a family friend when I was 18 and didn‚Äôt tell anyone until a year later then my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD when I was 19. But further on from that I‚Äôm nearly 20(have been moved out for 4 years) now but have recently come to terms with all the fucked up shit my mother has done to me and how much she‚Äôs actually messed me up and manipulated me.
narcissisticparents,fgl5qnu,t1_fgkb0s4,1580882926.0,Hit the nail on the head
narcissisticparents,fgi2dlh,t1_fgi249z,1580802363.0,Yep they won‚Äôt often think it‚Äôs possible that the vulnerable old person drove their children away so much they had to completely block them out of their lives for their own sanity hmmmm
raisedbynarcissists,fghwfuo,t1_fgh7g3g,1580795963.0,Say it louder for the people in the back who still say ‚ÄúBUT THEY‚ÄôRE STILL YOUR PARENT(S)‚Äù
AnxietyDepression,fgg8ebw,t3_ey8krt,1580756462.0,YES the same happens to me your not being over dramatic dw
raisedbynarcissists,fg8jxhz,t1_fdi6h4o,1580621846.0,That is a mind fuck and I hate to say it but I understand exactly house you feel. It‚Äôs such a mental block but you just have to go full steam ahead even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it will really happen! You really don‚Äôt realise how many people fake it Til they make it!
raisedbynarcissists,fg8jt05,t1_fdiibzn,1580621729.0,"Yes my mother liked to tell me I‚Äôd end up in a council flat in the bad part of town. If you haven‚Äôt heard it enough, I‚Äôm proud of you!!!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fg8jnao,t1_fg6mjvn,1580621583.0,Thank you. Yes opening these channels of communication is so important! Self acceptance and validation is key to moving forward.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fg8jk39,t1_fg8h5m2,1580621503.0,Can relate to this. My Nmom worked as a councillor for years and spent some time in a secondary school while was suffering with deep depression which she only made worse. Actually mind blowing?
LifeAfterNarcissism,fg8j8a5,t3_exhxzt,1580621196.0,"God dam! My ex nbestfriend of three years posts daily stories and many posts on insta about mental health issues. while she tormented and made me feel so shitty about mine for years when me being upset didn‚Äôt suit her, which was the majority of the time.  When I finally ended our friendship and stopped talking to her( after speaking/ seeing her nearly everyday for a very long time) she posted a quote on her insta story that read ‚Äúwhen the Narcissist gives you the silent treatment make it last forever‚Äù. The reason I stopped talking to her is because after I was raped, she was the first person I went to (I knew in my gut it wouldn‚Äôt go well but she was my BFF) she told me it was my fault  in not so many words and she never once after if I was okay (some how she linked it being my fault due to my poor mental health around the time, which mostly due to sexual abuse as a child, Along with the fact I had drank alcohol that night)  LIKE FKIN SCUSEEEEE MEEEEE WHATTTTT. I didn‚Äôt acknowledge it or say anything of it because I‚Äôm sure that was what she wanted. 
I still don‚Äôt understand who can look at their best friend of years traumatised and covered in cuts and bruises, to only rip them down??!!?? even more when they shout on social media how ok it is to not be ok."
raisedbynarcissists,fg7sk1c,t1_fg6q4zj,1580600403.0,"Thank you, that makes a lot of sense"
AnxietyDepression,fg72867,t3_ex8ca9,1580582280.0,Mental illness is never an excuse to do shitty things to other people
LifeAfterNarcissism,fg6jsrn,t3_ewyoyf,1580569865.0, Can‚Äôt tell you how glad I am you posted it. I‚Äôve felt some of these things but NEVER bring myself to breath a word bc I really thought I was the only one. THANKYOU
narcissisticparents,fg6idyf,t3_ewmvbk,1580568797.0,Any one else have their brains wired to think about themselves like this now and it‚Äôs literally destroying their lives as much your trying to fight it? Xx

raisedbynarcissists,fe9ejqx,t3_enpe96,1578936894.0,Every dam day! Even with therapy it‚Äôs still so hard wired in
raisedbynarcissists,fdhjpmd,t1_fdhildb,1578424096.0,Exactly! So glad u get it. Having Narc listing every which way you can fail because they just worry soooo much.
raisedbynarcissists,fdh8b4l,t3_elcpj7,1578417547.0,I moved out at 18 straight after I finished college (U.K.) and I told her before even though I was planning on moving out without a word. It only gave her a solid month to try and grind me down into staying. But I‚Äôve been away for over a year. Moving away from her is definitely the best thing to do especially for your mental health (in my opinion). I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôd definitely recommend some sort of talk therapy or just someone to talk to about what you‚Äôve been through with her. I‚Äôm currently in therapy now and realised just how many of my issues are down to having an Nmom.
narcissisticparents,fcn3npu,t3_eh9321,1577802374.0,I never could put my finger on what my mother was. I‚Äôve written a VERY similar letter to mine years ago but never sent it. Oh my god. Thank you for posting this
