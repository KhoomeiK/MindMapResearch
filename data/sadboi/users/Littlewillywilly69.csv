In 1984 it’s a means of population control and the theory is that whatever the party (the political organization running the show) says is true to its people no matter what and the people have no choice but to believe that either way. 

A questioning attitude is not a thing with the party and the people under their rule are conditioned not to even understand the concept of the party being wrong. It’s a mind control tactic."

Not saying this is you at all, but if you want what you’re looking for you’re gonna have to give the nice guys a try. And don’t be too trusting because a lot of people in general, not just men, have ulterior motives when it comes to this shit. 

You’ll find what you’re looking for eventually don’t give up, but don’t date the fucking idiots who are only after skin either. They’re plentiful in online dating. My best advise is to take it really slow. Don’t have sex right away and the guys who are only after sex will lose interest very fast. The guys who are after a relationship will not. Again not implying anything about you as a person, but this is just usually what goes on.

My mom is what caused all these psychological problems with her constant abuse of my family when I was a kid, followed by the abandonment. I fucking *hate* her and my stepfather, with all my heart, and now I’m stuck here having to look at them every single day. My whore-turned-housewife mother and my controlling piece of shit stepfather. 

Man I’m really trying but it’s so hard to see the positives in all of this."
Drugs,fngvx14,t3_g1jj2h,1586946955.0,"Happened to me the last time I done e like 5 year ago. First when I started seeing my ex girlfriend before we were banging she threw a little shindig at what would later become our apartment. It was me and a few of my good buddies (one of them her brother) and her and another girl. Me and my buddies dropped some mdma but her and the other girl didn’t. The other girl went home around 11pm. 

Boys were clearly very VERY fucked up but all I got was tingling in my hands and feet, like when they fall asleep, and a weird gut feeling. I had a couple of beers and around 1am my now-ex was heading off to bed. I felt like garbage and didn’t really ever get high so I went to bed with her (to try and get laid of course). Well this was only like our second time hanging out so she didn’t wanna fuck, so we just laid in what would later become our bed and talked for a bit, and she gave me a kiss goodnight and went out in one of the spare bedrooms to sleep. 

At this point the boys were downstairs acting like FUCKING lunatics. Running around chasing each other around the apartment with their shirts off and shit, yelling and making all kinds of noise. So I went and told them to keep it down and at this point I was completely sober. They kind of agreed and started hugging me and at this point I was very annoyed so I told them to fuck off and went back to sleep upstairs. 

Here’s where things get weird, and bare with me this story is relevant to your post. I wake up around 5 am and something is pushing me off the bed. One of my other buddies is passed out on the floor next to me. I feel something moving in the bed next to me and hear kissing noises. 

I turn around and here are two of the boys in bed next to me for some reason, FUCKIN MAKING OUT. Now I don’t care about what anyone’s attracted to, none of my business, but these are two straight men with girlfriends. So I get weirded out and scream “what the fuck?!” And go downstairs to sleep on the couch. 

When my now-ex girlfriend got up the next morning and I told her the story she almost died of laughter. 

MORAL of the story. I took the same dose as the boys. They ended up making out with no clothes on, and I ended up having my hands and feet fall asleep, and went to bed, sober as a judge. 

So ya, I get what u mean."

I won’t stay in isolation until 2022. I will die. It’s not a matter of if it’s a matter of when. It’s only been a month now and I very very nearly took an intentional overdose tonight. I’m 25 right now. If this drags on til 2022, I won’t be able to live my life until I’m 27 or 28. For one thing I can’t afford this financially. I want to start a life, I want to get married. Have kids. I need to get my shit together now or never. 

If this is going to be my life until I’m nearly 30 I for one thing won’t want kids anymore, because I’ll never recover financially. so that dream will die. I don’t want to live right now and it’s taking everything in my power not to end it all. Most young people can’t handle social isolation whether they’re mentally stable or not! 

I see people on Facebook posting memes about “day 26 of quarantine, going crazy LOL LOL”. It’s not a fucking joke. This will be absolutely devastating to people like us with mental health problems. 

What really turned my stomach today was reading about Donald trump saying this social isolation would cause thousands of suicides, and reading at least 20 articles of people debunking this saying how unlikely it is.

My cousin offered me to move across the country with her because she has a 3 bedroom house and her roommates are gone for the foreseeable future (college and uni girls) and I was honestly excited about it until I heard what she said to her mother (my aunt) after she ALSO filled her daughters head full of bullshit. 

“Oh don’t worry I’ll keep him in line! I’ll check his room to make sure he don’t have any drugs! I’ll make sure he don’t blah blah blah. I’ll take care of him!” She’ll *make sure* of nothing. I don’t need to be taken care of by anyone. I haven’t touched any drugs in years now anyway and they can’t seem to get past it and believe that I’ve finally got my shit together. I’m a 25 year old man and I’m not going to be controlled and spied on by anyone, regardless if I was doing drugs. 

Feels like I can’t trust any of them on my mothers side of the family. they’re all the same. My dad however would totally let me come back with him and god knows I miss my dog and my dad, but he’s getting old now and he’s a heavy smoker his lungs are kinda fucked, if I brought this coronavirus home to him somehow it could really hurt him. Idk what to do. His side of the family are  the only people who’ve  never judged me, gone behind my back, and always been there for me, and let me live my life. However that side of the family is very small, and none of them besides dad have any room anyway. 

I’m still strongly thinking of moving back east with my cousin, just to get out of here, but If I do I’ll be making it god damn clear that she won’t be checking my room or going through my shit. She’s young, and like my baby sister, so she’d be a hell of a lot easier to get along with than my “mother”, who no longer  deserves that title.

I mean come on she goes toe to toe with the fucking nemesis SEVERAL times and somehow actually beats him every time.

We figure he was force fed human mean while he was away from the game. It was also a wake up call not to go afk without leaving in this game lol."
Sekiro,fmnmy3q,t3_fw0lt4,1586229884.0,Yup when he died and I couldn’t leave the boss room I was like “oh no. Oh dear god no” then he started moving and picked up his head. My jaw actually dropped.
collapse,fmnmoyx,t1_fmnk5m8,1586229700.0,"Idk man but it was bad. All the symptoms were there and it was highly, highly contagious. I mean even the flu doesn’t burn through the camp population half as fast as that. It was bad. It prob wasn’t coronavirus but I’ve heard people saying it was here and in the states in November/December. Everyone who got it said it was the worst flu of their lives, they were really really sick.

Edit: also people come from literally all over the world for work here. Literally people from everywhere you can imahine. India, Asia, Middle East, America, Africa, the list goes on. I actually met a few big city Chinese while out there."
collapse,fmniynj,t1_fmmdn2i,1586227138.0,"I was in a work camp here in Canada and around the beginning of November EVERYONE there got sick. I mean everyone I seen at lunch (and there were a lot in a small place, think kinda like prison) was coughing and sick, and all my buddies there had to take at least a week off due to sickness at some point. I myself got really sick the day and couple days before I got laid off. 

Now what was odd was that I got “sick” at first, coughing, sore throat, minor aches, etc and figured it was just a cold and kept working, and I got better afterwards. Fast forward to a day or two later when I got laid off and I was so sick I literally couldn’t leave the bed. I had to call my stepdad to come and take all my shit out of my camp room and he had to walk me to the truck to bring me into town. 

The next week + after that were the sickest I’ve ever been in my life. Coughing so hard I puked regularly. Trouble breathing, etc etc. It was so bad I ended up on inhalers and I hadn’t needed to take an inhaler since I was about 8. Now some people are saying it may have been a wave of coronavirus. I believe it too."

collapse,fmhp6op,t3_fv9eet,1586089120.0,Fuck it. Burn it all to the ground. I don’t even care anymore. Our flawed society needs to fucking end. The misanthropist in me has exploded to life over the past few weeks.

Drugs,fmgh2ms,t1_fmggcpz,1586048900.0,"Exactly this is why he ended up with a broken jaw and waiting about 4 hours for an ambulance. If someone was there who wasn’t tripping it probably would have ended 10x better. 

By the time they got someone who wasn’t tripping (the girl named M) the damage was already done."
Drugs,fmgff4z,t1_fmgcrl5,1586047822.0,No ur right you should always have a trip sitter no matter what. If shit goes south and no one is in their right mind to think rationally it could end badly.
Drugs,fmgbyo4,t1_fmgbnew,1586045639.0,"Hey, I wasn’t there. I know what to do and what not to do in this situation. If it were just a few of the boys sitting around tripping on mushrooms or acid we wouldn’t NEED a trip sitter. Boys didn’t know what that shit was going to do they thought it was the same as acid. Can’t really blame em for being young and dumb."
Drugs,fmg7ds4,t1_fmg178m,1586042817.0,"Yeah that’s insane the guy tried it a couple times beforehand but nobody expected this lol. We all kinda thought it was the same as acid at the time, IE harmless."
Drugs,fmg0bnd,t1_fmemdfd,1586038609.0,I posted the story in the drugs sub go check it out
Drugs,fmecb71,t1_fme9rm3,1585998544.0,"Also they didn’t wait til past 8 to call the ambulance. It was already called before that but it’s a rural area outside of town, takes some time for first responders to get there from town."
Drugs,fmec9a7,t1_fmebxkw,1585998482.0,The boys were tripping mad balls. You know how when you’re tripping and something seems like a really good idea and turns out not to be? Either way I wasn’t there so idk what I’d of done differently. Personally I probably wouldn’t have punched him in the face tho.
Drugs,fmec7su,t1_fme9rm3,1585998431.0,Hey I wasn’t there don’t @ me

collapse,fm7ebz2,t3_ftg2nc,1585823785.0,I read on here something about Australia police wanting to roll out service drones and all I could think of was 1984 and how next thing we’ll see is thought police.
