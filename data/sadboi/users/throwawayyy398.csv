SuicideWatch,fr1zypq,t1_fr0eujh,1589828806.0,Thanks ❤️
SuicideWatch,fqsssn2,t3_gkk8pe,1589617587.0,I gave up at 22 (I’m 24 now)
SuicideWatch,fqgptlk,t3_gins3m,1589353227.0,Yeah for real! I got into an argument with my sister earlier today who told me to “just get over” my PTSD and stop thinking about the past (it’s not that simple with PTSD). Or my family would get mad and tell me to basically shut up if if I felt suicidal. I’m pretty sure none of them would care if I killed myself.
SuicideWatch,fqah8pb,t1_fq991io,1589219035.0,Thanks
SuicideWatch,fq99tfx,t3_ggtboh,1589190801.0,"Yeah, seriously! It seemed like it was going to be great I’m the beginning (how wrong I was) though all my goals and plans were ruined by this virus."
SuicideWatch,fq92zs8,t1_fq7wou7,1589183734.0,"I agree, Rachel sounds like a bitch"
SuicideWatch,fpqx2pn,t1_fpq19t3,1588834866.0,"Yeah, I have friends who’ve been sent there (I was sent somewhere else) though they told me it’s usually overcrowded and the staff was mean and didn’t care."
SuicideWatch,fp4wdg9,t1_fp1u47p,1588309137.0,"Yeah, for real. I normally spend as much time away from my house as possible (since my family is toxic and abusive and is triggering). I was supposed to move in with my friends last month and start a new job then but due to the shutdowns I had to cancel the move. I feel like it’s been pushing me backwards to how I was in high school."
SuicideWatch,fp4de65,t1_fp1y9ga,1588296663.0,Thanks
SuicideWatch,fovuvxz,t1_fotuqup,1588107936.0,"Yeah, for real! My mom’s parents were abusive so most of my relatives on her side were abusive to their kids too."
SuicideWatch,fotkk0a,t3_g9abgf,1588056802.0,"Same, I've been thinking of going though am unsure if it's safe."
SuicideWatch,fmvopnz,t3_fxo4zw,1586424951.0,"Same, I would’ve died 2 years ago if I had one."
SuicideWatch,fmqkc31,t1_fmq2lkf,1586301307.0,Glad you are okay!
SuicideWatch,fmqegke,t3_fwotsd,1586298070.0,"My mom acts a similar way. When I was hospitalized two years ago for an attempt she just complained about me ""wasting money"" going to the hospital (even though the insurance literally covered everything) and didn't care that I could've died. If I did die from it I bet she would just complain about the funeral expenses instead."
SuicideWatch,fmocgr7,t3_fwaneh,1586253809.0,"I can relate, my parents were very controlling too and also forced me to live at home throughout college. I was going to finally move out this month since I finally got a good job but it shut down the same week I was supposed to start last month (b/c of coronavirus and I had to cancel my move. I feel very stuck too."
SuicideWatch,fmas3ut,t3_fqh7mv,1585905612.0,That bridge is heavily patrolled by police who look for jumpers. I tried to jump from there two years ago and got stopped by the bridge police and put in a psych ward instead (don’t go there).
SuicideWatch,fmarulc,t3_ftxylp,1585905312.0,I’ve been wondering the same since my therapy offices closed down all groups were cancelled. I think if they did hospitalize you it could possibly be for a shorter amount of time too (though I’m not sure).
SuicideWatch,fmara28,t3_fu3xn6,1585904666.0,Same I feel it. I’ve come up with plans but can’t seem to go through with any of them.
SuicideWatch,fmar8ei,t3_ftxtgh,1585904615.0,I feel it. I was supposed to start a good paying job in March and move in with my friends this month (and finally be away from my abusive family) but it shut down a few days before I was supposed to start and I had to cancel my move. It seemed like things were finally turning around but it all got thrown out the window. Plus being quarantined with difficult people makes it even harder. I might attempt again very soon (I have a few things I have to take care of first).
SuicideWatch,fmaqwv2,t3_fttbjr,1585904253.0,I live in the US but I got put on a 5150 (Mental Health hospitalization) a couple years ago and now can’t buy one for a few years (otherwise I would’ve ended it 2 years ago).
SuicideWatch,flwjfat,t3_fr9ofe,1585552887.0,I used to be able to enjoy life and now I don’t understand how I used to.
SuicideWatch,flsvq0a,t3_fqtx8q,1585452020.0,Yep! The last time I was truly happy was in 2015 and the last part of my ambitious old self died in 2017. It’s a shame how that part of myself had to be destroyed by the messed up things that happened.
SuicideWatch,flfxeg4,t1_flfuori,1585121598.0,"Yeah, I feel as if I should’ve died that day and have felt out of place since then."
SuicideWatch,flfu1is,t3_fohop5,1585117778.0,"Same, my abusive family is making it even harder."
SuicideWatch,flftxdm,t3_foimh7,1585117656.0,Pure hell. The quarantine and my shitty family are making it worse.
SuicideWatch,fl92zdi,t3_fna1r3,1584939350.0,"Same, I’ve been quarantined with my abusive family and I want to kill myself even more."
SuicideWatch,fkyx9hy,t1_fkxwazn,1584658093.0,"Yeah I heard about that too, I’ll have to look into it."
SuicideWatch,fkyx7wf,t1_fkwb4zm,1584658066.0,"Yeah, one of my family member’s surgery got delayed too. I told my friend what happened and that I wouldn’t have all the money I need for moving until next month. Though they said if no one else ends up moving now because of the virus and it’s still available next month they would let me know at least. The timing of everything just sucks."
SuicideWatch,fkwj61a,t3_fl3jn6,1584594100.0,I’m happy that you survived. I have a friend who survived jumping off a very high bridge and he told me he regretted it the moment after he let go.
SuicideWatch,fkrzx4u,t3_fk5n3p,1584479396.0,"I agree, it makes no sense to me."
thanksimcured,fjc5q8h,t3_fcblfx,1583209309.0,I think my high school had similar posters though I think some students made them.
SuicideWatch,fj99nry,t3_f51ryt,1583138270.0,"I agree, it’s a mess. I don’t have much I look forward too anymore."
SuicideWatch,fj99bvp,t3_fblmoa,1583137847.0,I feel it. Other people are freaking out about the virus though I really don’t care if I get it and die. So tired of this life.
SuicideWatch,fj2xyp0,t3_fb2se9,1582958178.0,"Same. Two years ago I had planned to kill myself but before I was about to go through with it, I chickened out and hesitated. A stranger also interfered and I made the mistake of opening up to them and got committed to a psych ward (which traumatized me). Now though I regret not doing it then, especially since I have more things to worry about now."
SuicideWatch,fikrip9,t1_fikm6es,1582485901.0,"Aw! Thanks, I’m glad you weren’t badly hurt and I hope you’re doing okay too."
SuicideWatch,fikjb3r,t3_f8a4jq,1582481423.0,"Happened to me (but without the hug and it will be okay part) and got hospitalized, though I really would like to be hugged :("
SuicideWatch,fijgtgh,t3_f7xizc,1582447282.0,That’s what happened to me unfortunately. I finally had gotten the courage to go to a bridge to jump but then some random police officer happened to be there and stopped me unfortunately and put me in a psych ward. I’ve thought about trying it again but am worried about someone interfering again.
thanksimcured,fgrvui0,t3_ezzgep,1581059518.0,Ugh that’s something my dad would do
SuicideWatch,fgres8v,t3_ezzwnq,1581045044.0,I have the same issue. Visited a bridge today that I planned to jump off of but I chickened out (I’ve done this several times) and it’s frustrating. I hope you will be okay though.
SuicideWatch,fg1t34b,t3_ewbjoz,1580432797.0,Please avoid that bridge at all costs. It’s heavily patrolled by police looking for jumpers (I tried to go there before to jump and they stopped me and put me into a psych ward). My family found out about my mental health issues too because of it and it made things so much worse (so it was a terrible place to go).
SuicideWatch,fg06elu,t3_ew70u0,1580401221.0,I had something similar happen on one of the days I was planning to end it. A friend texted me randomly and asked how I was and that she was thinking of me.
SuicideWatch,ffhpxew,t1_ffhmysm,1579947634.0,Ikr? I’m surprised they haven’t lost their minds too.
SuicideWatch,fdi5zvk,t3_elewpp,1578436335.0,I tried to kill myself back when I was 15 but I failed. I wish I had done it when I was 22 and had the chance.
SuicideWatch,fcjlrpj,t3_ehfwhk,1577692914.0,"Yeah, I think eventually my mind starts blocking memories out and I forget briefly why. Then they come back and the cycle starts again."
SuicideWatch,fcaf5fb,t3_egukih,1577568175.0,Same. Two years ago in college it seemed like I was going to go on and do great things with my life. Instead it’s gone in a completely different direction and went downhill.
SuicideWatch,fca8q6x,t1_fc8cdqj,1577564795.0,I’m seeing about switching to a different one that I can afford. I majored in Animation and it’s been pretty competitive and a bit difficult landing a job (besides freelance work).
SuicideWatch,fca8gsw,t1_fc93hpo,1577564664.0,"Yeah, I have a part time job"
SuicideWatch,fc4r1ar,t3_efrofy,1577425285.0,"Had something similar happen last year. I made the mistake of telling a cop I was suicidal (I didn't know much about 5150's then and that they could commit you for saying that) and they forced me to be hospitalized. If given the choice I would've preferred to just go see a crisis counselor the same day instead of being forced inpatient. I didn't want my parents to find out I was suicidal or having mental health issues again (they have been abusive in the past and not understanding of depression and would make rude comments about it). I was forced to stay overnight since the only psychiatrist at the hospital had left for the day when I got there (and there was no overnight one). I got transferred to a mental hospital a few hours later, even though I hadn't been evaluated by a psychiatrist yet and the staff at the new one blackmailed me and refused to let me leave unless I told my parents about what happened (it was very traumatic) even though I didn't want my family involved. My mom just complained about me ""wasting money"" going to the hospital and my dad made jokes about it. Honestly was one of the most traumatizing things that ever happened to me."
SuicideWatch,fbni29w,t3_edrvtb,1576998122.0,"One time when I went to a bridge to jump last year, someone else had jumped minutes before I was going to and the police were already at the scene so I ended up having to turn around and leave."
SuicideWatch,fbngg5k,t3_edri6i,1576997408.0,"Worrying about what would happen after death or failing and being injured. Or sometimes little things I want to do (like waiting for a show ending,  movie release or event I want to go to) holds me back."
SuicideWatch,fbfjhx9,t1_fbejn4i,1576812108.0,So true!
SuicideWatch,fbedfba,t3_ecm1af,1576783457.0,"Yeah, some people (like me) have abusive families or family members who don’t understand mental health and depression and they can’t go to them for support."
SuicideWatch,fb9o9tz,t3_ec37xx,1576644191.0,I feel it. I think if other people were in my situation they would’ve killed themselves already.
SuicideWatch,fa7y935,t3_e7rhrd,1575839318.0,"I'm so sorry they said said that you, they are trash for treating you that way. My mom has said similar things to me in the past and then had the nerve to get offended after I was hospitalized for an attempt."
SuicideWatch,f978yoi,t3_e40jii,1575162069.0,"Yes. I live near a local suicide bridge and every time I hear about a death from it or see a tribute to the person who jumped, I wish it was me that died instead."
SuicideWatch,f7a19r0,t3_dusmc5,1573518583.0,Exactly! I found that yoga was more stressful instead of relaxing.
SuicideWatch,f6rpzj2,t3_dsso7t,1573114952.0,"Yeah, I've been wondering if I actually died a year or two ago and have been sent to purgatory as punishment. I feel like a ghost in my life too. I think I died by suicide in a past life though and that as a result I won't be able to ""leave"" as easily in this life."
SuicideWatch,f6rduwy,t3_dsr31d,1573100737.0,"Same, even when I’m smiling or laughing or having a good day it’s always in the back of my mind. I’m not sure why this is."
SuicideWatch,f6rdb3a,t3_dspqb6,1573100255.0,"Same, I just want to fall asleep somewhere (away from this world) and disappear forever."
SuicideWatch,f6qswmg,t3_drwtdp,1573085081.0,I know someone who survived the jump and he said he had regretted it immediately. I want to jump but I’m afraid of surviving too or of regretting it after.
UnsentLetters,f6qru91,t1_f6qo18k,1573084317.0,Same here
SuicideWatch,f6ohihm,t3_ds9p8z,1573018068.0,"My grandma is sick and is very upset that she might not live past next year. I really want to die and keep failing, but she really wants to live. I wish I could die instead and that she could continue living, it’s a messed up situation."
SuicideWatch,f6ofvdg,t3_ds4ila,1573016426.0,Same here. I should’ve died last year though someone intervened and stopped me from doing it. I’ve attempted since then but both were unsuccessful.
SuicideWatch,f6nbsmk,t1_f6ler0l,1572988281.0,"Yeah, same. I’m worried about failing and ending up even more screwed up than before."

RoadRage,f4y8ey9,t3_dkptcs,1571873377.0,Some guy stopped randomly in the middle of the street (of a green stoplight) and put his hazard lights on so I get annoyed and move around him to pass him up (didn’t honk or anything) and then he flips me off? So I flipped him off too for blocking traffic in the middle of the street and he flips me off again so I flip him off again too. Smh.
SuicideWatch,f4uefc6,t3_dljftt,1571807437.0,"Same here, it's just completely pointless and meaningless to me."
animationcareer,f3e2ao3,t1_f3da3g2,1570854785.0,Thanks! Yeah I would've saved more money taking my GE's at a community college instead of there.
animationcareer,f3d8729,t1_f3ck9ql,1570833105.0,"Thanks! Yeah, I owe around the same for my undergrad too (I regret not going to community college first) :/ I’ve been dealing with a similar situation after."

SuicideWatch,f2ui8e7,t3_de5a9e,1570417229.0,"Same, I’ve been suicidal for the past two years and it’s gotten to the point if I feel “normal” or okay, it’s disturbing to me since I’ve been suicidal for so long."
SuicideWatch,f2pb2og,t3_dduz68,1570340268.0,My birthday is coming up at the end of the month and I want to end it before or after then. I really don’t want to be a 24 year old loser.
SuicideWatch,ezwpx7q,t3_d2n7fc,1568222324.0,Same but with a family that sucks less.
SuicideWatch,ezvm83u,t1_ezv7r9j,1568184334.0,Yeah. I'm stuck between thinking it's eternal nothingness or the possibility of our conciseness/energy living on in some other form or dimension.  While the idea of an afterlife is interesting it also sounds a little overwhelming too (though it could possibly be pleasant). If it's nothingness I imagine it's like the in-between stage of dreaming and being awake (when you're unconscious but not aware of anything at all).
SuicideWatch,ezvlp94,t1_ezvc4jx,1568183610.0,"Same, I don't want kids either and probably won't ever be able to afford a house with my student loans."
SuicideWatch,ezv7978,t3_d2758x,1568169051.0,"Yeah, I'm afraid of failing and being sent back to a mental facility like last time. Nobody knew I was suicidal before then and after I got hospitalized EVERYONE in my family found out because the awful staff refused to let me leave unless I told them about it."
SuicideWatch,ezv6ro5,t3_d2ehwe,1568168666.0,Thanks everyone.
SuicideWatch,ezud3oh,t3_d2cp1q,1568149835.0,Good luck! I've thought about going inpatient again though too many things are in the way right now.
thanksimcured,exdybx8,t1_ex1fz11,1566190798.0,Ikr? Doesn't make sense.
thanksimcured,exdybev,t1_exbpwvf,1566190783.0,For real! It's the opposite of helpful.
SuicideWatch,ex0lekc,t3_cqvtni,1565915979.0,2017 was pretty terrible for me to (the worst year of my life besides 2010). I'm still trying to get over the trauma from then and the therapists I've had were unhelpful so far. Glad the music helped you though.
SuicideWatch,ewqrv8l,t1_ewo9fyj,1565676346.0,Most things in my life have been messed up and have fallen apart since 2017.
SuicideWatch,eusuc5c,t3_chci34,1564013838.0,"My mom has done the same thing and has told me to go kill myself before  (she's also racist and homophobic). She's even said to me and my siblings faces that she hates us and wishes she never had us (goes on about how ""great"" her life would be if she never got married, moved out here and had kids). That reflects more on her character than yours though and it's messed up for anyone to take out their issues on their kids (or anyone)."
SuicideWatch,eu6vbqx,t3_cer8fl,1563509942.0,"I was 11 when I had my first suicidal thought. I had gotten into a fight with my friends at lunch after one girl spread a fake rumor saying that I had made up my mom abusing me for attention (because I was afraid to have anyone call the police about it) and people believed her. I was crying in a bathroom stall and tried strangling myself. The second time was when I was 12 (when I first started experiencing more symptoms of depression) and had gotten bad grades/was close to failing my classes. Our grade reports came out that day (not a report card but a snapshot of your current grades mid-semester) and I knew I would be in trouble for my low grades. I planned to run into the kitchen as soon as I got home and stab myself in the chest with a knife before my parents could see my grades. Though my dad did something unusual and made me give him my progress report as soon as I got in the car, even though I tried to convince him to wait until we got home. I then got screamed and cussed at and he took the my door off the hinges of my room until summer and my mom also screamed/cussed at me as soon as she got home & I wasn't able to go through with my plan in time."
SuicideWatch,eu5u8d0,t3_ceryei,1563485470.0,"My last therapist had that stigmatizing view too and acted shocked that I was able to do two part time jobs and still went out with my friends even in the worst of my depression (I only managed to do that to spend time away from my toxic family). Many people were shocked when I was hospitalized for the first time last year because I “didn’t show any signs” (I wanted to keep the illusion my life was together and shock everyone when I ended my life). Even the cop who stopped me from jumping thought I “didn’t seem like” someone who would jump off a bridge (I still kept my appearance together and stayed well dressed, wore makeup, etc). It's surprising how many people believe the illusion."
