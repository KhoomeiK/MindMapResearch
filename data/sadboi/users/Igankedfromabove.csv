depression,f58iqzh,t3_dn7s4p,1572057007.0,I was in your shoes months ago. It sounds like you’ve made the first step by seeing you could use some help. You’ll know when you’re ready for help:) that’s what happened to me
depression,f58iiwi,t3_dn2eeb,1572056875.0,"Brain fog, fatigue, anxiety, push everyone and everything away, no motivation in any parts of life."
depression,f58icjj,t3_dn7om6,1572056773.0,I love showering or bathing when I’m sad. I might do it 3-4 times in a day.  It’s weird because my body never gets cold. When I’m sad I fucking freeze.

depression,f4z2d1q,t3_dlp6ws,1571892236.0,"It always amazed me how depression sucks your mind. My whole life I've always had a good memory, and it has been one of my better skill sets. 2019 has been an awful year for me, and I can hardly remember the details of the last few months. It is all just so vague and diluted."
depression,f4z1rsw,t3_dmav92,1571891642.0,Congratulations. It always feels so much better and refreshing for me when everything is in order and clean in the house. It's only uphill from here. Goodluck!
