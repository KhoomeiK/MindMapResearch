AmazonFC,fqj4y4e,t3_gj5hz9,1589405104.0,"I did it. I'm on PLOA and getting unemployment benefits. When it asked me why I didn't look for work or why I'm not working. I was just honest and put it's because I'm on a leave of absence. Don't want to go to work due to having parents being at high risk and don't want to risk exposure. Few days later I still got approved for those two weeks and got paid.

Edit: I'm in Cali by the way"
Unemployment,fqe7d56,t3_gi5zqo,1589302946.0,Update: just went from pending to paid. Even though I stated I was on a leave of absence and not going to work due to risk of exposure. I think you are able to do it. It's not like I lied to them or anything. Still was approved
Unemployment,fqcxe12,t1_fqcx3zz,1589272212.0,I've heard some still getting approved by putting leave of absence as the reason for no income. I recently just did this on Sunday so I should find out soon if they'll approve it

Would it be possible to use credit cards but as a debit card? Through my understanding credit cards are not using your own money? From a checking account? Or could you do both? Do you have any banks to recommend that are good?

But anyways yeah I did all of those things to help deal with my tiredness. I think drinking a lot of water helped the most though. I would drink a lot during my shift and at home. I noticed the more I drank water. The less I felt tired. I did go overboard with the water though honestly.

Personally when I first started working night shift. Nothing really helped with that besides adjusting. I had the exact same problem as you and I hated it. It took my body around 2 1/2 - 3 months for it to adjust. Now I'm never tired on my days off or even during the day.

GooglePixel,fpbk05i,t3_gcbi90,1588471777.0,I honestly don't understand why people care so much about base. Like it's good to have bass don't get me wrong. But some people just want the craziest amount of bass possible.
