Korn,fmdpu8x,t3_fuezh9,1585974328.0,"The first time I heard about KoRn was from a fellow schoolmate back in late 94. He was wearing the white and black scarecrow ""KoRn"" shirt, I used to poke fun @ him for ""listening to a vegetable"", because at the time I was not into that type of music. Not too much later when I was getting back into rock I was listening to a local rock station and ""Shoots and Ladders"" came on. I was so intrigued by this song that began with bagpipes then turned into this melodic cathartic song I was hooked right then as it was so unlike anything around at that time. I've been a huge fan since. 

Sorry things are rough right now and hopefully things get better soon for you.

I haven't met too many people who are fans that disliked them at first but it's always interesting to hear why they became fans, because in some small way I can relate. I dealt w/ alot of shit from my peers growing up and didn't have many friends but I had KoRn to know I wasn't alone in my suffering and that helped a little.

Hope tomorrow is better, until then put on some tunes."

VSync and GSync both to ON in the NVCP.

Disable VSync in the in-game settings.

Limit frames using in-game limit if avail to 3+ frames below max refresh rate for monitor. If the game does not provide an in-game limiter use RTSS. This will ensure that GSync is always engaged. 

To answer your final question about performance loss. No, you don't lose anything. The caveat to that answer though is if the physics of the game are altered w/ frames. An example of this is back in the day was Quake 3 Arena. There was a ""trick"" that if your computer could produce a constant 333 fps you could alter the physics slightly and jump a frame or 2 higher/further. This from my understanding is no longer the case w/ games today, keep in mind that Q3A was 20 yrs ago LOL"

CompetitiveWoW,f1aejms,t3_d87cbp,1569291901.0,"Is it an upgrade for the person it dropped for? No, then loot council it to the person for whom it's the biggest upgrade. Min Max after everyone is caught up.

The way loot should be IMHO. I feel guilds that try to control loot are grasping at straws looking for control. If the raid environment is done correctly then the majority of players present should feel compelled to see the group achieve as a whole.

BoE's are usually handed into GM for guild bank which in turn funds our repairs. Maybe a cut for the person who picked it up.

People/Guilds often forget ""The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts"". I can tell you when you create an environment that is free from resentment you end up w/ some really awesome camaraderie. That in turn make raiding fun as hell!!"

techsupport,ezcrerd,t1_ez9g5b5,1567839381.0,OK so the next thing I would do is run a MemTest over night to see if anything shows up. From there I'd prob start looking @ it being a hardware issue. Could be PSU or GPU I say this because of the environment in which it's crashing. Out of curiosity what kinda speakers are we talking? Standalone speakers/headphones plugged into an audio jack or usb. Or are we talking speakers built into the display? Is this a prebuilt system or did you build it yourself?

techsupport,ez8tyfq,t3_cyjphe,1567759410.0,"need a little more info about comp specs.

55C on a GPU is not warm, especially under load. Frankly it's in a really good spot (if that's load temp)

81C on a CPU is very warm but will not cause overheat protection to kick in.  Depending on CPU that won't happen until around 100C+ which is far from 81C

A nice tool for people who are unsure where to start looking for answers is ""WhoCrashed"" google it and check out the report. If you would like you can also check ""Windows Event Viewer"" out. To get there hit your ""Windows Key"" and type ""Event Viewer"" you might not need to type out the entire thing as Windows should know what you're looking for. While in the Event Viewer go to the left pane and chose ""Windows Logs"">>""System"" Don't pay too much mind to errors in here or it will drive you mad. You want to look for Critical errors around the time of the last crash and see if anything stands out. Though if you are unsure I'd just start w/ the WhoCrashed report and see where it goes from there.

&#x200B;

Do you have any overclocking done, are your drivers up to date, is your MoBo updated w/ the most recent BIOS, is Windows up to date? Simple things I know but often overlooked.

If this was happening only in games on my rig, my first suspect after checking out event logs would be to do a fresh driver install. If you don't or have never use DDU then I would highly recommend it. Just follow the directions and make sure you have the latest version of drivers ready to go."

HumansBeingBros,eqm0bwt,t1_eqlyokh,1560153987.0,"My general stance goes as follows. If the animal is roaming and there are no signs posted otherwise I read the body language of the animal then shower them w/ scratches and pats. It's always polite to ask an owner whenever they are present if they would mind. Most people love to share that furry ball of friendliness, so a quick ""gorgeous pup, is he/she friendly?"", ""what's their name?"" or a ""may I pet?"" seals the deal. Never had someone tell me no to saying hi to their friends. I have run across service dogs and while it's tempting to want to interact w/ them it's important to remember they are doing a job and it's probably a good idea to just let them focus on the task at hand. No one likes to have their work interrupted."

We kill the elementals let the debuff fall off then interupt Jaina for an easy kill. Sounds like RL might not understand WCL too well. Looks like he has gone and searched for DMG on Jaina and saw that destro is king, on overall DMG numbers. Ask him to redo his search for BOSS DMG instead. The problem is that Havoc is easy to toss on a ballista, ordnance, and Wall. This in turn makes Destro look better overall on the fight, but lets be real. If a ballista, ordnance, or the wall is an issue, then you guys have other problems to worry about instead of parses."
