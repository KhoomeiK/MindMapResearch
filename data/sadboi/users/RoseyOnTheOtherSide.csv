Don‚Äôt say things you don‚Äôt mean just because your arguing. That will never make things better. Social media is a part of everyday life now. He needs to accept that and you both need to find someone more compatible with your habits. 

I used to be someone who craved male attention. (I was sexually abused as a kid) For me when I found the right guy, I no longer wanted anyone else‚Äôs attention, much less craved it.

self,euntowm,t1_eunso7s,1563933388.0,"Thanks so much! Can I make a suggestion? This is for ANYONE! Married already, Dating, Divorced or a Teenager! My husband was given a book as a wedding gift when He married his ""practice wife"". (His words, not mine! lol!) He loaned it to me when I was 18, before we started dating. I swear by the knowledge I found within its pages and give that knowledge, credit for making my marriage what it is today!

It is called, ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"". I caught myself looking around for cameras in the house because it told me things about myself that even I didn't know!"

Nope, not there either, back to the hills of Tennessee. I am now 38 years old and have spent more than 15 years here in total. Something about this place gets in your blood. Once it connects, it pulls you back, no matter how far away you try to run! Thank you for sharing the beauty of my home!"
