Menopause,fd7n7mb,t1_fd7escy,1578207070.0,Me too! Was just thinking this morning how I really should get out and do something. That’s as far as I got. Enjoyed watching a few Harry Potter movies. Now I’m watching Anne with an E. C’est la vie!

depression,fag0vau,t3_e8wf5e,1576036939.0,"Happy birthday fellow Sagittarian. I celebrated my 55th birthday yesterday. I was working all day. When I got home, it was just me. Not overwhelming and able to hang with my cats. 
It’s not easy to maintain and nurture friendships. It’s taxing a lot of the time. Keep getting to know yourself, that’s what the 20’s decade is for. 🎂"

Thanks all for your replies.

Had NO IDEA this tune had words. Just thought you sang it “dosey dotes and gotsey dotes a leedle ams a divey. Akittley ivytoo. WOULDN’T YOU?!” Only the last two words I understood and it never made sense. 

I’m in my 50’s (hence a lot of people won’t know this old jingle). Realized there were words a few years ago."
Hypothyroidism,f8jrgwe,t3_e0nrr2,1574603574.0,"Yes! It makes much more sense to read this. I was misdiagnosed years ago with being bipolar. I was on five different medications, including lithium. I was a zombie for 18 months. Decided this wasn’t for me. I’m my old self again, but different. Thought I was introverted. Nope, just get easily overwhelmed with too much outside stimulation. 
My biggest issues are brain fog and exhaustion. Plus perimenopause. Ugh. 

I do believe supplements help. I take them every other day due to cost. But they’ve helped with energy and focus."

caregivers,eudtbzg,t3_cfzbed,1563726993.0,"I understand. I had a client I worked with for eight hours a day as well. However, the house was very clean, no pets and family members worked. Yet I still felt bored. She was a sweet woman, but there’s only so much you can talk about if you are on opposing sides of politics and pretty She was much a prude. I tried looking at it as “easy money”. I didn’t neglect or treat her poorly. I just couldn’t be myself and after a while, I felt resentment. I’m in a different line of work now. After a dozen years of being a caregiver, burnout became unbearable. 
Hopefully the agency you work for will help you find a better client closer to home. If not, there are plenty of agencies out there for employment. Good luck."

Jim Carter hosted and he’s adorbs. 

Reallllllllly excited about the movie!"
