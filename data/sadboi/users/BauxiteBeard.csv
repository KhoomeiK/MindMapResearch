they wouldn't let me get snipped before 30, my ex wanted her tubes tied and they wouldn't let her till 2-3 kids or over 30."

AmIFreeToGo,ezw9qo4,t1_ezw8f8x,1568211567.0,Its kind of funny USA spent hundreds of years warning each other of a standing army and why you need the 2nd amendment to just create a standing army and not use the 2nd when your government gets taken over by a hostile nation.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,eygwa7v,t1_eydpty9,1567077763.0,"I noticed this a lot at different jobs and in video games over the years, they always seem to incentivize bad behavior and then try to stop it without removing the incentive and it never works.

Behaviour rewarded is behaviour repeated, that works from fish to human, the key is finding the reward, an example would be a child acting out, if they want attention and act out, even bad attention or punishment is still attention."

legaladvicecanada,ey4dzyt,t1_ey4b0hl,1566789274.0,"I am 6'1, at 213 pound's I was in the hospital, I had been starving to death slowly for months I was quite literally wasting away, skin and bones, throwing up every day unable to eat, then put on IV for 2 weeks and after that I was weighed in at 213.

BMI is not really accurate in my case, because at that point I was still ""obese"" and yet, nearly no fat on me at all, just a bunch of shit."
AmIFreeToGo,ey38bfs,t1_ey38487,1566757910.0,"> Are you suggesting being an asshole is an auditing technique? That calling someone a fat ass is a method?

Absolutely, if you can bait the cop into acting outside of the law/policy then it was a great auditing technique, especially if they would have normally behaved themselves, its the result not the method that makes an auditing technique as long is the method is legal in and of it's self."
