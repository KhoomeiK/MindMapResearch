askatherapist,fqndrta,t1_fqn8ms6,1589493051.0,"Thanks for this! I meant more if they know them personally, in a non-therapeutic context. Like if they shared a mutual friend, for example."
confidence,fqiaitg,t3_gis29r,1589393335.0,"My ex had one so large that I couldn't give him head. It literally wouldn't fit into my mouth. It sucked for him and it sucked for me. At least you'll never have that problem! Bigger isn't always better!

Seriously, what others have said is true: dick size really doesn't matter that much to us ladies. Personally I think foreplay is everything. Get good with your hands and mouth and you're sorted!"
ExNoContact,fqan233,t3_ghgw7w,1589221850.0,No amount of heartbreak justifies saying things like this to another person. It's a disgusting way to talk to somebody. Good riddance!

AskReddit,fpb99oi,t1_fpb5yy0,1588464851.0,100% agree. Those sorts of beliefs are all over the internet. Inlcluding Reddit. It takes effort not to be insecure about aging as a woman when it's learned from such a young age that youth = beauty.

FemaleDatingStrategy,fnlrli6,t3_g266yr,1587058517.0,"I got told I was ""too much"" after setting boundaries with a man I was dating (I told him that listening to love songs he wrote for his ex made me uncomfortable). He gaslit the whole situation and made me feel ashamed for expressing myself and told me I was ""too much"". I held onto what he said and felt really ashamed, and it meant that in my next relationship I had no boundaries and never stood up for myself. In therapy and getting stronger now, and can now see him for the narcissist he really was."
