Dont beat yourself up. Pray to God for faith, for confirmation. Sometimes when I pray or just talk to Him I feel chills and tingles. Thats enough to keep my faith going, He truly does listen, He knows what your going through. Call out to Him ""cast your cares upon Him for He cares for you.""

You've heard of women being more attractive during their most fertile stage in their ovulation period, it could be the male equivalent to it.

I personally think when you stop masturbating you remove the shame that naturally comes with it, thus people are more aware of their own shame. I remember being a kid first discovering self-abuse even though it felt good I remember feeling shameful about it afterwards, and I was surprised to know that I wasnt the only one to feel that way.

Actually in the bible in the book of leviticus ""nocturnal emissions"" to the israelites was cause for removing someone from their camps for a day or so because it made them ceremonially unclean iirc. Also sex between a married couple would make them ceremonially unclean for the rest of the day and they were commanded to wash themselves. I believe in the bible 100% so I think there must be something to it if makes one ceremonially unclean in the old testament.

Also, now I just want to talk to you person to person. I remember before coming to faith in Christ, I used to be so lost, I was deeply into new age. I did mushrooms, I meditated, but I failed to realize how demonic this movement was.

I've had some weird experiences meditating. I've had some mind shattering demonic downloads while doing mushrooms. All I can say is New Age is demonic and dangerous, and spirit guides are demons masquerading as angels of light. ""For even satan masquerades as an angel of light"" -st. Paul.

Just start off by knowing Jesus first. Believe In Him. Admit you're a sinner like we all are, all sin is sin, and Christ died on the cross for all sin. Murder is no bigger sin than a lie, the homosexual sin is no bigger than gluttony.

You dont have to clean yourself up. We cant overcome sin ourselves, but it's Christ in us who starts the sanctification process. We have no power on our own, It took God having to step off His throne and put on flesh to save us when He didnt have to. If thats not the most perfect form of self sacrificing love, idk what is. Have no doubt He loves you. Build a relationship with Him ""cast your cares upon Him, for He cares for you."" Talk to Him like a friend.

I dont want you to be scared and run away from the faith, neither does He. As soon as you accept Him you are saved. Christ clothes our nakedness with His righteousness. Salvation is a gift.

But many people have conflicting views here. Some say that once saved always saved, they think you can live a life of willfull sin and still be saved because ""salvation is a gift of God not of works lest any many should boast"". Others think you need to be living a life of repentance, that repentance which is turning away from sin saves us. Of course they believe it was ultimatley Jesus' sacrifice that atoned and saved us but also many israelites were saved from egypt, but many rebelled and did not make it to the promised land in the books that moses wrote.

I myself am not sure, I just try to please the Lord knowing that if I do fall His grace picks me up. Also why would I want to run that risk, right?. Our God is a God of love, God IS love. But He is also a God of Justice, He is a God of mercy, and patience. He is really a perfect God, a God of balance.

Once you accept Him, you'll want to be perfect for Him. You'll want to stay away from sin, you'll start to hate sin, and love righteousness.

But as king solomon said.

13 The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.- ecclesiastes 12:13-14

God loves you, make no mistake about it, but God HATES sin. 

When I came to God I knew I was going to have to leave my sin behind. My sexual sin was easy to handle due to me previously practicing celibacy, but even when I was in the world I still stuggled with it. Now thanks to the grace of God i'm 5 months celibate. I just have trouble with other sins like gluttony, and sloth, but I thank God for being so patient, merciful, and forgiving with me. I will never be perfect, but I can try.

God’s Promise Is Not Slack

3 Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), 2 that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of [a]us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, 3 knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, 4 and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.” 5 For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, 6 by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water. 7 But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and [b]perdition of ungodly men.

8 But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward [c]us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.

The Day of the Lord

10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be [d]burned up. 11 Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, 12 looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat? 13 Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

Be Steadfast

14 Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless; 15 and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation—as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, 16 as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.

17 You therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, beware lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the wicked; 18 but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen."

Some other guy prayed for me and told me where I was staying at the time at what street I was staying by. And some other guy told me some secret prayers I would speak with God about. He told me ""ceaser, your tired of people always telling you your a calm and good kid, but in the inside your always full of distress and anger"" I was always so quiet and shy, but inside I was melting in despair. I Would always talk to God about these things as a kid breaking down in my room telling Him the exact same things seeking comfort. Jesus also said true believers would do these things because He has given us authority, this is all biblical stuff y'know prophesying, healings etc. My grandma's kidneys where miraculously healed too. She has diabetes and the doctors told her, her kidneys were failing, and theres really not much you can do but prevent further damage, right? Well at church they gave us small white cloth's that had been prayed over, and told us to take them home to pray for sick, loved ones. I did. Next time my grandma came from the hospital she said her kidneys were healed by 40% enough that the doctors were shocked.

I've seen other things too. My mom got knocked out by the presence of God at church. She was on the floor laughing, and giggling, lol. She said she was overwhelmed with ecstasy, and love. Some gal came to her saying she needed to forgive my father (they had been divorced) they told her to forgive 'jose' which is my dad's name, she thought I'd told them but I never did. It's all Holy Spirit work. 

There's also a LOT of testimonies on supernatural encouters with Jesus.

Isaiah 53 talks about Jesus too. Here's the chapter
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53&version=NKJV

You can tell Jesus too. Ask Him. Tell Him from your heart ""if you are who you said you are, show me."" Come with humbleness. ""I know that i'm a sinner but if you are real God show me, and i'll accept you, and if your not then nothing will happen."" He'll do it because He loves you. If you seek Him He will take notice. 

""And without FAITH it is impossible to please God, because anyone who approaches Him must believe He exists, and that He REWARDS those who EARNESTLY SEEK HIM"" - Book Of Hebrews

Take courage lady, He came to save. Salvation is actually for the Jews first, then the gentiles. He is the seed through which God promised Abraham to be "" the father of many nations""

Love you, and Jesus loves you even more!"

TrueChristian,fpwx01l,t3_gfudnq,1588971509.0,"""And without FAITH it is impossible to please God, because whoever approaches Him must BELIEVE He exists, and that He REWARDS those who EARNESTLY SEEK Him.""

I always knew He existed, although I never really sought Him ""hardcore"", but i've seen some crazy miracles. My grandma's kidneys were failing and she got healed miraculously from a prayer, all glory to Jesus! The doctors were pretty baffled because there was a 40% increase in health.

I've seen my mom get her lights knocked out at church by His Holy presence.

I've been led supernaturaly to church when I was in great distress, i've had people prophecy over me and tell me my past actions. And I know it sounds crazy! But even paul talked about the different gifts of the Spirit and they are real for sure.

I can feel God's presence when I worship, and praise Him. Everytime I talk about Him with people and throw scripture at them I feel chills, and goosebumps over my back, arms, and head or just when I talk to Him.

TALK TO HIM!!! like you would a real person. Bring your troubles to Him. You lack faith? Ask Him for faith. Ask Him what His favourite candy bar is/ what kind of sports car is His favourite/ what kind of koolaide does He prefer, talk to Jesus, build relationship with Him, talk to Him about sins you struggle with, for help, for forgiveness.

He is real! There is no one that can tell me He is not real.

You can even see testimonials on youtube about billions of supernatural encounters and miracles about Jesus. Not mohammed, not krishna, not buddah, not no one. Only Jesus is Lord. He is the way, the truth, and the light.

 Jesus said in John 14:21:
""21He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and [f]manifest Myself to him.”"" are you willing to give up your sins to get closer to Him? Sin sets us apart from Him. Believe in Him truly, if you are hungry He will notice.

""God is not a man that He should lie"" all The words of the bible are His words, His promises. Believe them like a child would believe his father, with child like wonder and curiosity, with faith.

It got better than it used to be. I actually think it was a Godsend, since it drew me closer to God. During my darkest He has always been there, I know it can get depressing at times, but keep your head up. It's nice to have hope, it's nice to be able to fall back on Jesus.

 Anywho, I cant say much to comfort you, other than, yeah it takes time dude. I'm able to carry stronger stuff now, and type on my phone, wash dishes, etc. I think i'm already healed, well it's waaayyyy better than before. I basically had a lifeless limb, but thank the Lord! Looking back on it this was really A Godsend, I think I've really grown in my relationship with Christ He is always there for you. Everytime i'm in worship I can just feel His presence.

RadicalChristianity,fjkxmyk,t1_fjjkyrx,1583435928.0,"What your saying basically Is that God made a mistake in making he a he, and she a she, because they say so. When God made Adam, in His image He said it was good. When He made everything He said it is good. Homosexuality is just as bad as all the other sins. Some people cant control sexuality, dosent make fornication right. Some people love to steal, and cant help themselves, dosent make it right. Sin is sin. How can you be for that when that path leads to destruction? God made man to fit woman like a puzzle. Other puzzle pieces can fit too, yeah if you jam them in. Homosexuality is basically that 2 wrong pieces that were jammed together, and people say it's right cause they say so. God said otherwise.

 I'm not doing this out of judgement, or hate. Yes even Jesus hung out with sinners, but He never approved of their actions. When He saved the woman from being stoned He said ""Go and sin no more"" hell is a real place dude, reconsider your theology, because that kind of thinking will lead people astray. ""In the last days people will have itching ears, hearing only what they want to hear""

 I know you say it's not their fault, and it's not ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.""

This kind of mentality is demonic, and is perverting God's creation. Please dude in love pray for some answers. Pray to God for answers!
Just because I cant control my sexuality as a man and it's a fleshly urge dosent make it ok! The flesh decieves, but the spirit brings forth truth! And that is the truth, that if you love God you will follow His commandments. We love Him because He loved us first. Most of these gay people are hurting, they're in need of a saviour and they dont even know it. My heart hurts for them because they are being decieved. The enemy is slick no doubt about that, but ""He who is in me, is greater than he who is in the world"" please dude open your spiritual eyes! This world is going to hell and it's that kind of mentality that is bringing forth destruction. The stage is being set for the anti-christ, look at the world!"

 You can ask God for justice, He'll give you justice. It'll rain on the just, and unjust alike, but even as so they'll be judged, you'll be judged too. They might of killed, but jesus equated hate in your heart as murder. Sin is sin, and Jesus came to die for them as much as He came to die for you, and our so called ""trivial"" sins. 

I know that it must be hard to deal with that, and if it were to happen to a loved one I know i'd have trouble finding forgiveness in me, but God found abounding forgiveness in Himself to give to us. You can go looking for justice yourself, but God Himself said ""Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto God's wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine""

When it comes to deeds like these you love your brother like the good shepherd loved us, for He loved us so, that He laid down His life for His sheep. And that is the commandment that if you dont love those who God loves, you truly dont love Him. Even I have trouble with that, but on account of justice, you really shouldn't be asking for it, for God indeed is just. What we should really be asking for is Mercy."

Translation stays true to the original word, if you don't trust the scholars who translated it to English you can download the ""bible hub"" app and do the research yourself.
