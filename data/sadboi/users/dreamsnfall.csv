depression,fr0m767,t1_fr0kn6a,1589800448.0,"Yea.. I do have that problem.. that’s why I don’t know what to do.. I do put myself in these situations where I wait to know what I’m doing to start living.. but I hate that I do that.. i want to just live and have fun like you said.. but I’m such a planner.. but yet I’m so disorganized and full of clutter. I plan so much that I never even do anything, thus wasting more and more time. I don’t want to wait and do things , I want to experience them now. I need to grow up"
depression,fr0lu6g,t1_fr0kvgl,1589800116.0,"I’m 22, going on 23 and I haven’t done shit.. I had slightly good times when I was 18-20 but it just completely ceased. I kept getting fatter and fatter so my energy was just gone but I still have motivation.. I still haven’t given up on making memories in my twenties but I’m starting to feel like it won’t happen. Right now, I don’t have friends, but I know the way I’d like to be.. personality wise. It just seems like people don’t really want to go on spontaneous adventures.. they just want to live their life in their phones, which I am also guilty of.. but if I had a friend I’d never use my phone again.. that’s the difference. I had a best friend but..unfortunately.. we don’t really talk anymore.. I’m still hurt about this. But I have to move on and find happiness with other people.. but.. it just seems like I can’t reach and continuously fail"
depression,fr0kkhh,t1_fr0k6zm,1589798922.0,"Honestly all of it.. I’m trying to find my way. I don’t want my twenties to pass and not have experienced things. It kinda drives me crazy, and it makes me anxious because I want to do so much. I want to look back and be like wow when I was in my twenties I could remember when I lived in Italy for 6 months, or when I traveled with my best friend and we partied all night. Like I need to make these memories.. but I don’t want to plan them.. they need to be spontaneous.. these moments can’t be planned"
chat,fr03uvh,t3_gluzbn,1589782943.0,"Yea.. I’m always looking.. either they cost money, not enough people using it, bunch of weirdos.. reddit is kinda like the only wholesome place left.. but if you want to talk.. I’d be down 🙂"
AskReddit,fqzp5w6,t1_fqzo0nj,1589772203.0,Oh.. I can’t move because I’m going to college in my city and it starts in August.. although the covid stops us from actually having classes for the fall.. I mean.. I guess I could try and move just for the fall semester.. do you think that’s a good idea?
AskReddit,fqzlwr1,t1_fqzl17m,1589770107.0,"You are very right.. location plays a huge part.. this is why I kinda get sad living here because it’s just one big city... your limited on options.. and not everyone wants to work in a office.. or at a grocery store.. I’m a student and that’s where most students work.. but I just find it very hard to work at jobs like that.. I don’t even mind if the more “rural” type jobs pay a little bit less.. it’s about the atmosphere.. I know I will get tired of working a city job thus making me want to quit within a month, but a outdoorsy, uncommon job is much more exciting, and I can see myself working there longer. It’s a lot to ask but I’m really not built to work at a pressure infused industry.. they work you.. they work and just simply can replace you.. it’s not worth working there. Sometimes I wish my family ended up living in a more rural state.."
AskReddit,fqzlg50,t1_fqzkoj3,1589769828.0,"Awesome thanks, I tried Craigslist before .. a lot of people didn’t respond but I think it’s because I wasn’t filtering out the jobs I wanted.. I also love writing so I’m gonna start filtering that out.. I’m tired of working at the usual target, grocery store type industries.. I find that I have a hard time working those jobs because I get really miserable .. like I’m just stagnant .. so if I’m gonna get a job, it has to be something stimulating.. like gardening, or working on a dock, something uncommon, or working dealing with something of my craft.."
AskReddit,fqzkedp,t1_fqzk8qc,1589769252.0,"I see.. what about working in a pottery studio.. or working in a garden .. I can’t work in retail or things like that.. I need outdoor, calming type places... sad part is that I’m living in SoCal so.. it’s difficult to find jobs like this.."
depression,fqz1aaa,t3_gliw37,1589758126.0,"Wow I relate to this so much.. like I can’t even naturally think, I always think too hard and it just doesn’t come out right.. it’s anything but ease"
AskReddit,fqyt8jp,t1_fqys5tn,1589754170.0,😔 it is.. maybe this will be my wake up call to stop using social media and go out and live a adventurous life...
AskReddit,fqys31r,t1_fqyqiu8,1589753621.0,"Well that’s not really where the hacking comes in, it’s when they ask you to enter your password on this page to “verify your account” is all false, it isn’t Instagram asking you to do that. And that’s where many people are going to get hacked because it looks like a regular verification thing.. and no prob!"
AskReddit,fqyryve,t1_fqyr8y4,1589753565.0,"Uh no.. the thing is they ask you to put in your password on this page, it just looks like they are trying to verify your account. It looks like Instagram is doing it, but they aren’t. It’s like it logs you out and says “we need to verify your account” so it has you enter your password... it’s looks a lot like Instagram is doing it, and that’s immediately when I got hacked. The messages people send with the “hey check this link out” is the aftermath of getting hacked"
AskReddit,fqypxc6,t1_fqyo38o,1589752605.0,"Yessss, so this is what happened. My brother kept sending me these messages, and then I clicked on the link( not sure if that’s what caused the hacking ) so after I did that, the next time I clicked on the Instagram app there was this page saying I needed to enter my phone number because Instagram needed to verify my account.. (I didn’t think anything of it because it looked really legit) so I entered everything and put in my password and the boom, I immediately got hacked. The person was literally messaging celebrities while I was on my account, I could see them typing messages to people. And then they deleted a lot of my messages. So I hurried and changed my password and now it looks like it stopped. But you have to change your password not on Instagram app, it’s better to do it on a browser or a different device. It’s so weird because people will assume it’s Instagram doing it but it’s not, it’s someone else. And they will enter their number and password and get hacked..

*also my brother got hacked then I got hacked*"

Once he can get this f1 visa I think he is eligible to study at the community college."

sad,fqsq7fb,t1_fqsoao6,1589615019.0,Hmm.. i know I may sound like a loon but at the same time I don’t want to be loved..
sad,fqso3va,t1_fqsnub1,1589613025.0,"Ive never actually been in love, I wish I had this power with strangers and people I know.. being irresistible without a person even knowing me.. it’s this unexplainable desire for a mysterious stranger .. but I know I don’t have that.. thus I know I won’t be loved unconditionally.. and yes I believe looks have EVERYTHING to do with it.."
sad,fqsnr56,t1_fqsn97w,1589612700.0,Yea.. I mean if I don’t have love in return I stop giving love.. sometimes I wish I was those people that people loved unconditionally.. the person so many people desire.. but I’m not and I don’t know why I thought I was..

depression,foxnf3x,t3_g9ndgw,1588149632.0,"Wow.. I know how you feel.. you described it perfectly.. now it just feels like..nothing. I’m just living.. but not alive. Why do we feel this way? It’s so upsetting because it seems like it’s only been getting worse every year. It’s like a flesh eating disease.. simple things don’t make me happy anymore like they used to. I remember.. I was still sad but atleast going to see my cousins could genuinely cheer me up.. or going to the movies with my family could brighten my day.. oh.. but now.. those things have no chance. Everything is exhausting.. it almost seems like I shouldn’t even be having fun.. like having fun is some taboo thing.. it’s like normal to feel empty.. that’s what it has come down too.. sometimes I think.. “damn.. are there people out there who are actually get up in the morning, excited. Going about their day normally and living so freely, and only getting sad or mad for normal reasons and then can hop right back into being happy?.. yea.. yea there is” and it’s crazy how these people exist and I can’t seem to understand how they are able to do that..

CasualConversation,fnczdoz,t1_fncycaq,1586852673.0,Perfect way to describe it.. I mean think about it.. we are living in a place called earth.. which is in a place called space .. full of stars and other planets.. when you stop and think about that.. it’s sorta trippy.. people dismiss it all the time... they get so wrapped up in their lives that they really don’t see how magical everything really is.. humans are so powerful man.. we are capable of so much more than we were taught..
CasualConversation,fncxwot,t1_fncxmfc,1586851086.0,"Oooh I don’t know their names but, I saw this one cool video where it was like “pictures that give a weird nostalgia feeling” those are amazing! Because I didn’t realize other people got that feeling too"

AskReddit,fn2p68e,t1_fn2oxh1,1586597663.0,Well.. it’s like I definitely can feel emotions.. but sometimes with certain things I just don’t. And sometimes these situations are serious.. and I still can’t feel anything. Of course .. if I see something horrendous like a kitty being killed.. I definitely have emotions of sadness.. but it’s like with certain things maybe like someone’s life situations that are bad.. and them telling me about it.. I really don’t feel anything and I have to pretend to be sad for them.. but I SHOULD be sad for them but I just can’t naturally do it... like I said even in serious situations.. I can’t find myself feeling anything at times .. I don’t know what to do when someone is crying or upset .. it’s uh.. odd

AskReddit,fn2oph6,t1_fn2oh3h,1586597121.0,"Hmm.. what about if a person can’t really feel things when people express their anger, frustration, or sadness to them.

I thought I was the only one who felt like this.. sometimes I get real sad when I can’t remember a dream too .. it’s not normal how much I miss a dream.. and I do feel like sometimes my dreams are magical and I have better experiences there than in real life. I tell myself..”you know if you can’t have those experiences in real life.. it’s okay because I’ll just try to dream about it tonight..” it’s sad.. it sucks that this is what I say..

I’d still be able to move around but it would be super painful probably and uncomfortable..it does definitely suck working out. It’s like I can workout out for a week but then after that I just somehow don’t have time anymore.. or I can’t fit in the day but I know these are all excuses I’ve made up in my head just so I don’t have to workout.. it’s the same thing with food, I make up excuses in my head just so I can eat something bad. I will spend my last little money on food.. it’s ridiculous. When I got my first job I spent ALL the money I made on food.. didn’t try to save anything. And that’s when I got big.. 2017! That was the year. Since then I’ve only gotten bigger and bigger. You see, once I got a actual job is when things changed because now I had the funds to buy what I wanted before I didn’t have the funds I was still in high school and only ate what I could at school, but even then I would find change in the house and go to store and buy candy and chips and stuff but it wasn’t as much as I wanted so when I got my first job out of high school.. I went nuts. Ordering loads and loads of food, eating whatever I wanted. And it continued and even after I left that job I got another one and my actions just got worse.

That means it isn’t genuine
