I tend to have multiple projects to work on, that I work on straight, then drop, then maybe pick up again, then drop, and on and on til it’s done or I just forget about it. I am currently doing something consistently, working on it pretty much everyday. Started shortly after lockdown. I started making masks. But designed my own, and each one is tailored to each persons face. One takes a little longer than the generic mask patterns, but it fits the persons face nicely, therefor eliminating gaps and minimizing it moving, cause you don’t want to be touching it and adjusting it while you’re out. Anyways, I’m really impressed with myself. I’ve been keeping at it for a month and a half now. Working 5-6 days a week on it. I don’t know, I just saw that you could make homemade masks, and knew it would give the people I care about protection and help keep them safe, and I just kicked into gear. But since each mask is different, it keeps it interesting. I probably wouldn’t be so active at this if I was making the exact same mask over and over. My brain would go numb. I’ve been working on balancing other important life things, like cooking and household chores. In the beginning I was just focused on masks and was ignoring the rest of life. But I’m using an app called Brili that is super helping me organize myself. It’s a parenting app and I use it to parent myself. It’s keeping me decently on track."

Sometimes, I need to be lazy, because my brain needs to be in nothing mode, and if I don’t do that, I can’t get my brain together to tackle things that are on my plate, or that are coming up.

Been treated for bipolar for 9 years and ADD for about 3. Finding the right ADD medication took a while as they either made me unstable and bipolar cycle(which is a big problem for people who are bipolar and ADD), and upping my mood stabilizers made them not work, or the ADD meds made me really down and not able to concentrate at all. Finally got on adderall, and it works very well. But I know very well that I am bipolar with comorbid ADD. Emotional intelligence is actually one of my strong traits and has been since I was a teenager. I don’t have much emotional baggage. Very very little but I’m aware of what it is and understand it and know when it’s affecting me. The bipolar symptoms are very much from bipolar and innate. I was born this way and can remember having symptoms to my earliest memories, which is 4 yrs old. There’s nothing in my life that led to me having bipolar like symptoms. It’s simply bipolar disorder. It dropped on me fully, like bipolar does, when I was about 23. There was nothing other than my natural brain chemistry that incited it. Thank you for being supportive though!!"

I’m very upbeat and people assume I’m dumb and not very analytical because of that for some weird reason. But I usually understood the world better than the people who talked down to me. I remember one guy I dated, who talked down to me a lot, he’d be explaining something and I’d say something affirmative of my understanding of what he was saying, then “blah blah blah”. He would always be like “um no, not blah blah blah” and try to explain where he was going. To which, I would pick up and lay out where he was going with that(he was in marketing and wanted to talk about it a lot and it just wasn’t that interesting, hense the blah blah blah). And dontcha know, I’d be on the button every time, and every time he’d be surprised. Lolololol. Right, buddy, I know you’ve decided I’m not that bright. But this is not a serious relationship and I don’t care what your view of me is. I’m just here to have some fun and sex. 

I didn’t really understand I was ADD til about 3 years ago though and those people certainly didn’t know it. I am bipolar as well and that took precedent for many years, until I realized my doc was right and I really needed treatment for ADD on top of the bipolar. That was a huge help with my depression, which has been incredibly hard to treat. Turns out, a bunch of it was from ADD(and serequel, which I’m still on but at a lower does that is instant release!!!

I know each of the words individually and what they each mean, but I can’t figure out what they mean when they are put together(this also happens when people speak to me.

There is no room there for people to have their own stupid, misinformed opinion regarding covid, or to act based on their misinformed beliefs. There would be lots of “war against covid” propaganda people would see daily. And people will get behind all that. Their dedication to an issue like this is far beyond us.

Over, move on, don’t waste your time with this person talking to them again about your limits and asking them to take them seriously. If they truly thought they were important, they would’ve stuck within the lines the first time."

bipolar_irl,fiuij7u,t3_f9wtea,1582742057.0,"I go through periods like that. I’m usually in some kind of mild depressive phase when it happens, which makes sense. The period always ends eventually. Can take a while. Something I’ve come to accept and be realistic about with being bipolar, is whatever phases I’ve gone through, I’ll go through again. There’s no “well that phase is done and therefor out of my life”. It will happen again in some form. Accepting that and being aware of it makes a big difference when stuff comes on. Because I know what’s happening in general and I’m just like “oh right, this shit again. Alright brain, run through it”. Not being finalistic with your think about your current situation is really helpful to not feed the funk."
