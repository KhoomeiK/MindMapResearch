recruiting,fq0sxx0,t3_ggej1b,1589037222.0,"Everyone had some really strong ideas to think about during this lull time. I am/was an internal recruiter for a large mkt research and live events firm - I was furloughed in mid April so I get it. I felt like my value and contribution had been bulldozed to near zero; for most of March I was doing HR admin work and helping release people; no fun. Anyways, the first thing I would say in response to your post is that you are not useless just cause you‚Äôre not operating at your normal rate. It‚Äôs easy to feel defeated and almost worthless when the work you‚Äôve done day in, day out vanishes. Keep your head up and find the opportunities in the problem. Corny, but true. 

You can:

-respond to reviews and testimonials on Glassdoor or other review sites
-review your interview process and refine it to lower time to hire or cost per hire metrics
-update job descriptions; think about how COVID will change how people do their jobs (eg zoom, teams, etc.)
-take online courses through Coursera or Masterclass or LinkedIn Learning; might as well up-skill
-run an organizational network analysis to evaluate how people are sharing info/knowledge at work"

And, was able to swing a great job as a Talent Acquisition/HR Manager which is a great stepping stone for IO, at least if you want to be on the people side (vs the research/statistics side). I was out of school for 5 years, I had my undergraduate degree in general Psych, and took some basic stats courses (less than the 3 you took). So, the way I stood out for college interviews and job applications was a few things:

1. I took the aPHR certification through HRCI (SHRM has a similar cert)
2. I tweaked some of my previous work experience to be more people operations focused
3. I wrote a brilliant essay about my obsession for human behavior, Org development etc. 
4. I revamped my LinkedIn to be IO-focused by liking, posting, and sharing IO related info. 

I had 3.2-3 BA in general Psych. 

I got into all 4 schools I applied. Did not have to take the GREs, and then my school acceptance helped me get the job because they‚Äôre in related fields. 

Hope this helps.
