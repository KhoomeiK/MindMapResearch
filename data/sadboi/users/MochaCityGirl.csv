raisedbynarcissists,fjy87gg,t3_ffe8py,1583691774.0,"It's pure jealousy. My mom was like this. I remember her making a comment about how I had a crooked neck (I dont). She'd also disrespect my personal space by trying to pop my pimples. I hate wearing earrings btw and I remember waking up some mornings with her following me all around the house trying to put earrings on me. 

There's so much more, and I know it hurts like Hell, but please dont allow it to pierce into your mindset. Mothers should be uplifting and comforting, not jealous bullies."
raisedbynarcissists,fjy6q2h,t3_fez8q3,1583690938.0,"My mom taught me everything except how to cook. I found out later that when she was younger, she cooked for her family and ppl thought she was a better cook than her mom (my grandmother). So to me, it was always a way for her to ""stay on top"" so to speak.

Sad...but thankfully there's YouTube University. Now I'm able to make a good southern meal that my bf loves eating."

raisedbynarcissists,es1yjke,t1_es1xfh4,1561509191.0,"Damn this angers me to no end. I was suppose to buy a car from my dad (had the money in hand and all). Then at the last minute, he decided he didnt want to give it up and took me for a ride in it to look at SUVs in different lots for him and his wife (my stepmom) the same night he basically said no.

He totaled the car in the end, so it is what it is."
