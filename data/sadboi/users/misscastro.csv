SuicideWatch,fp8g51z,t3_g7uhew,1588391436.0,& it’ll never end...
SuicideWatch,fn1za8c,t3_fxjwd8,1586573777.0,Yup. Think about it all the time. How simple it’d be. Sleep is the only peace I ever experience. Waking up is horribly disappointing.
SuicideWatch,fk57a93,t1_fk20r7l,1583874850.0,"Thank goodness other people see this too... like wtf is the point????? I DREAD going to my job every day, but I HAVE to in order to pay bills & keep a roof over my head, for a life that I don’t even fucking want to be in!! The work is never going to end. Getting a “good” career is an endless circle of spending money to make “better” money??? This system of life is an absolute joke and people continually try to tell you “just find happiness in yourself and eventually good things will come.” Like what good things?! People come into your life and you feel like you’re not alone, but they’re just going through it too, and at the end of the day they don’t care for you more than anyone else.. they either hate life just as much or are freaking kidding themselves & are falling into the assembly line just like everyone else... I spend everyday now thinking about how I’m going to go out of my own choosing, or hoping something will take my life sooner... I continue to do “adult” things and feel so guilty knowing it’s a waste of time for everyone.. soon enough I won’t be here & the car, the apartment, etc, of mine will be a problem for my those still around me ... but it won’t fucking matter because I won’t be here and everyone will move on with their lives."
SuicideWatch,fk55pe9,t3_fgek7z,1583873962.0,"Yes ... you stole the words from me... how long can the potential guilt keep you here ... because once you’re gone.. you’re just gone.. & one day that’ll seem so freeing that nothing will stop you.. 

I wish there was something positive and uplifting to say to this post, but I got nothing but the same hopeless realization that death is easy... life is hard ..."
depression,fjs0nw7,t1_fhwkwmz,1583592293.0,Same
offmychest,fjmp8fu,t1_fjmnide,1583478061.0,"I feel you and I appreciate your words. I already did that phase tho, and I still lost everything, so it’s hard to continue to feel like I should continue trying to be better if at the end of the day the only person I really care about their opinion of me, they just think I’m a POS.."
2meirl4meirl,fjln20v,t3_fdyhz1,1583449945.0,"About to break down crying in public, because I miss that one reason so much & now she’s thousands of miles away. 😿"
2meirl42meirl4meirl,fjbx8f8,t1_fj1d6jy,1583203437.0,"You get it ... people will give you these speeches of why you just gotta keep fighting but it’s like.. I’ve already done that & here I still am! Still done ... even after people say nice things online or whatever, life is still just as shittty.."
2meirl4meirl,fjbw98p,t3_fcjewh,1583202814.0,"My boyfriend. . former boyfriend.. would describe this exact thing & I remember there was a time where I did not exactly understand it... 

but after the last year of life. I get it. Stepping out of this despair and depressive state is more scary and uncomfortable than just staying in this place of numbness that is most familiar & now makes the most “sense.”"
MadeMeSmile,fja35bx,t3_fcbfkb,1583165396.0,Wow this hit me hard...I need to find a support like this.
SuicideWatch,fj7v4tn,t1_fj6yige,1583098974.0,"♥️ 

I want to find hope & comfort in those things again.. at times it seems impossible when you have no extra money to spend on anything & it’s not like people around you  stop their lives to wait for you to catch up... so it just feels like you’re being left behind while you struggle to not drown. I know things can be simple & full of chances, but damn the walls you gotta get over first are real discouraging."
SuicideWatch,fj7uk0q,t1_fj6y22y,1583098612.0,"Really tho... every minute you’re alive you’re spending money you don’t really actually ever have, because of how much inevitable debt you have & bills never stop. & there are people out there who have so much money they don’t even know what to do with it. Do we wait around for someday things might change? It’s exhausting."
SuicideWatch,fj4iha1,t3_f9tmix,1583009035.0,People look down on you and treat you like a basket case .... as if they don’t know life is awful... it’s crazy how the littlest things trigger a breakdown once you’ve reached that point before ... found a piece of clothing that belonged to the one person I thought had me. Whom decided over night that they no longer want anything to do with me ... the only person who truly gave me a reason to keep going. it’s tiring  when you’ve reached the point that you’re putting up an act with every interaction you have with others.
SuicideWatch,fj4gesc,t3_eyjkyc,1583007659.0,FUCKING EXACTLY! The only reason I can’t jump off the ledge is thinking about how much it would hurt my family... but at some point is that gonna be enough???
2meirl4meirl,fj42bc3,t3_fbam2a,1582998661.0,fuck

sad,fj41cyb,t3_fb6kti,1582998030.0,yup & no hope for any day ever being different. life is quite miserable & seems like anyone who says otherwise are either lying or just in denial. .
