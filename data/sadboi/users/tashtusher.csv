I was somehow raised to think a trans person is completely normal though, and that the whole concept was natural. And even used actual appropriate pronouns. Don't know how that came to be with most of my region hating any form of difference but that gave me a good basis to think from.

I feel like it doesn't matter if someone's muslim or not, in general the ""Arabian region"" is riddled with homophobic ideas that seem to be the norm, and living where I am deviating from what's traditional or ""normal"" can sometimes be fatal.

Surely muslim people are more strict considering they have lots of rules and restrictions which only prompts them to be extra strict with their beliefs, but knowing that even people who aren't muslim feel the same way in general, shows that it doesn't entirely depend on one group of people, it's more their stubborn ideas. People raise their kids wrong man, and their ideas cement worse cuz everyone else they relate to agrees with them.

I'm not an expert in religion at all, but that's how I feel like from being in the fronts of it all. Of course I'm more rational here discussing the whole thing not mentioning the many killings of us on a daily basis and being forced to stay shut about them so we can survive but, we can't forget that can we?"
