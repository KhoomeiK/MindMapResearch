depression,ew7soij,t3_cn4s45,1565196617.0,"I had this feeling, and then I really did snap, last fall, and had to go to the hospital. I had a really terrible experience in the hospital and I don't like to think back on that time. I guess the only ""good"" thing that came out of it was opening up to my dad finally about having depression for a really long time, and him taking it really well. But it's not that he didn't believe me before, I just didn't want to tell him. I don't know if this helps at all, sorry. :("
depression,ew7ok6p,t3_cmwrhq,1565194910.0,"Yup, I feel you."
depression,ew461em,t1_ew3d1v1,1565103631.0,I know how you feel about hoping to catch a cold so you can stay home. I also wish that too :/
depression,ew1f2n3,t3_cmcier,1565022041.0,"I keep wanting to take a sick day but feel too guilty about lying about the reason so I just force myself to go to work anyway, because I feel like I'm being lazy if I take a sick day due to depression :("
depression,evt1rju,t3_cl2yzy,1564760977.0,I forced myself to get out of bed and go to work. I seriously considered calling in sick for at least half an hour but then decided against it because I'd feel too guilty about it.
depression,evt0puj,t1_evshc9k,1564760336.0,"Yes, omg, my husband teases me for rewatching the same stuff but I have trouble watching new shows or movies because it takes a massive effort just to focus on the plot."
depression,evt0iuk,t1_evso3ow,1564760220.0,"Yes! I know I'm not supposed to drink with the medication I'm on, but a couple of drinks makes me feel back to normal. I don't drink very often but the times I do I've been told I'm apparently very witty and fun to be around. I just wish I could be like that without having to drink :("
depression,evt0e23,t3_cl0x7g,1564760138.0,"I have been so upset about this lately, I feel exactly the same way. I suffer from anxiety as well so I end up getting really anxious that I will be dumb forever and lose my job and won't be able to work anymore and so on. I have been wondering if it has anything to do with the medication I'm on or if it's just from a mix of anxiety and depression. I hate feeling this stupid, though. I was one of those really advanced kids in school and very quick witted, but now I just feel like a lifeless blob that doesn't want to do anything but sleep. I forget words really easily and have trouble paying attention to and following a conversation, movie, book, anything. Thinking about being like this for the rest of my life just depresses me more.

&#x200B;

Out of curiosity, does anyone else find that their medication dulls them? I have been depressed since I was an adolescent but have only been feeling less sharp in the last year or so (I'm in my 30s now)."
depression,euqjs0g,t3_ch0sl1,1563979884.0,This is so me. But I have also been worried that my meds are making me dumb. Or my anxiety. Or all three. I'm not sure >.<
depression,eukm8jl,t1_eui0gb2,1563890238.0,Thank you for this.
depression,eugv3r2,t3_cg8vi2,1563815451.0,Thank you.
depression,euguqb4,t3_cg8tj3,1563815248.0,"I know exactly how this feels. My doctor has been changing my medication and apparently he sees an improvement and so does my husband. But it's because I can eat now and not break down in tears all the time. But things don't feel enjoyable, including my hobbies. Everything, including ""fun"" things feels like a chore to get done. The only thing that feels good is to sleep. At least I don't have nightmares right now. God I would love to sleep right now..."
