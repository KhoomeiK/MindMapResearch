depressed,fr5kkj4,t1_fr1djjf,1589910085.0,"Sorry for the late reply, sounds a bit like he has checked out a bit or assumed it was just an argument that's done with now? Not really sure as that's not how my mind works, I'd want to sort things out and ask what to do to figure things out. Maybe I am actually just weird like that. 

Certainly doesn't seem like an easy person to live with, maybe try opening a conversation by asking to talk and putting your ideas across first but don't play the blame game, that never ends well, go for more ambiguous things like this is how I feel because of this action but we can work through it so it won't happen again. Wording is everything, don't make things anyones fault, state it more as this action is having an effect, how do we move past it. 

It might help but I'm no expert, if you think it's worth trying then please do as it may get better results. If  you're already doing that then I can only listen and try to offer you some support,  listening, talking etc. Please try to relax when you can though, you still need time for yourself."

depressed,fqvka0f,t3_gl6eba,1589679086.0,"It may take some time but things can and will recover, it'll be hard work and you might not feel better for a while but keep moving forward and you'll get there, Just keep going and it will be ok, might be autopilot for a while, might seem like its not going anywhere for a while but it is. You will be ok and things will work out, in the meantime if you need some help or support or ideas or just a place to chat then head back and drop a message here or make a new post, if we can help we will. For now try to relax a little knowing the future will be ok, you can't immediately do things sometimes and stressing won't help, veg out with tv or youtube and let yourself relax, you're allowed to relax and enjoy yourself. If you must stress start again on Monday when you might be able to take action to sort something out. You'll be ok, hugs."

SuicideWatch,fq6nigp,t3_gh3z2j,1589134943.0,"My partner has experienced this and a friend has too, it will take time but you can get better. Start slow, if you need to shower in your underwear then do it and swap to clean underwear while under your covers in bed. If you have no shower gel or can't face washing let the water run over you and get out. Try the 100% rule, it works for some people. If you spend 5 seconds brushing your teeth you're 100% better off than doing nothing, if you stand in a shower you're 100% further along than you were by not doing it. 

Therapy might help but in between I'm sure myself and others will listen and help any way we can. If the 100% rule doesn't work for you (I hate it and it doesn't do a thing for me personally) then we can listen, if you want suggestions we can suggest alternatives or other things to try. Just don't think you're alone in this, you're not, we will help any way we can."
depressed,fq6me16,t1_fq6ki72,1589134325.0,"It's not all your fault,  equally it's not all his fault either. The fact he tried to stop you despite getting hit shows he cares about you and that you're ok, the anger can rise up quickly and sometimes it's too fast to quell with rational thought. There are a lot of things that can help, sometimes it's the little things that irritate like a splinter in your mind and can drive you nuts. When you feel the anger rising there are a few ways to help stop it, breathing doesn't do a thing for me, personally I find distraction works best and something involved like a YouTube video (I'm a huge geek type) on engineering etc takes my focus enough to help me rationalise the anger and overcome it. 

I'm not saying it'll work for you but it's worth a go and worth finding whatever works best for you. Night time is my worst time as it's brain overactive time so I use some ASMR videos which even if they don't give the tingles they seem to help quiet my mind. Having decent sleep and a quieter more relaxed mind helps me a lot, that said he's going to have to put in some work too and learn to read you and the situation so he can help of take himself out of the situation to allow you to cool off.

I hope some of that makes sense, if you want anything elaborated on or even just to vent feel free to. I'll do what I can even if it's just listening."

I don't judge and been both sides of the fence, I'll help if I can"

The theory is most likely due to mass and gravity (the galaxy of that size should crunch) but that's not to say other forces aren't at play, theoretically all of the solar wind from those potentially massive stars could conceivably hold them apart if spacing was just right. A theoretical physicist can definitely answer better than me though."
CR10,fnd6ekw,t3_g0s85f,1586860551.0,"Try the most simple things first, multi meter the micro switches and bed leveling sensor, make sure they work. Just because it's doing something it doesn't mean it's working.

Second, factory reset the firmware or fresh install new firmware, this will mess up any custom settings you've done but gives a fresh blank canvas.

Third, open it up and check the main board, if everything shows as working/reporting correctly then it could be a main board issue, this may not be visible if it is the issue.

My initial thought is that your bed level sensor has gone out of calibration for some reason, find the specs and check it with a good multi meter or spare sensor. Maybe it's reading but resistance is too high/low or similar like inductance. Make sure it reads as per the spec sheet before wiping out your settings and when you test it use a spare bit of metal to trigger the sensor while it's way off the bed so if it doesn't stop you can power off immediately to prevent further damage.

Edit: use ferrous metal if it relies on magnetic sensor, aluminium can create eddy currents but iirc not all levelling sensors can do that."
Creality,fmscf3l,t3_fwwu72,1586352425.0,In all honesty the Ender is a better beginner of the two but I think you would quickly hit limits depending on how involved you wanted to be. I've got a CR10S as my first printer and its a little steeper learning curve but has more flexibility when it comes to bigger items and such. It can be frustrating at times but once you get the hang of setting up and get into tuning print settings and motor steps etc I think the CR10 is better than the Ender. Just my personal opinion though.
