Now if you want my advice (maybe you don't but here) as someone who lives in a nearby proximity of L.A , sure the jazz scene is great, but you need to first be damn sure you like the area, its not what its made to be by movies, it's definetly not glitz and glamour, and for alot of people it can be hard living with traffic and all. That's why I maybe suggest going to somewhere near L.A, unless you like L.A, and though I dont doubt your talent, there's a chance you wont get in, some schools already have their last spots for the year filled up. California in general though has great Jazz Schools, theres always RCC, its an hour away from L.A but has its own jazz scene too, and the general area is good.
