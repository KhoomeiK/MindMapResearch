I guess when we're talking about all the costs behind picking and installing a new head unit, whether a unit has a volume knob should be the least of my concerns. I only bring it up because in a video on an older model, the AX100 I think it was, the volume knob was also used (long press) to bring up Google Assistant in AA instead of having to navigate to the mic icon on screen. Does your Pioneer have a mic button, and if so, how does it work with AA (if you're an Android user)?"

You have a place with us as long as you need it. Many of us have relatives with bipolar disorder, some who have also taken their own lives. It's a curse of the condition. You will find people who understand what you are going through here.
