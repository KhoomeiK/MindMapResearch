dogs are considered animals that can be kept alone because they build up strong emotional bond with owner or the family they live in. the same goes for cats (plus, most cats here come home to eat but the owners let them out when the cats want to go outside, so they are likely to socialise with other cats)"

the thing is that I have absolutely no problem with making friends, that means, socially everything is fine. but I‚Äòve alteready received multiple weird looks or comments when someone learned about the fact that I have never been in a relationship. for instance, I‚Äòm at someone‚Äòs birthday party or whatever and I have a really good conversation with someone (woman or man, doesn‚Äòt matter) and then at some point they ask whether my boyfriend is also around and I say I don‚Äòt have one. then they ask why and I say I don‚Äòt know, just haven‚Äòt found the right one yet. and then they will ALWAYS ask when did you have your last boyfriend and then when I say I have never had one - the way they look at me and the way they treat me changes. I can always sense how they think what the heck is wrong with her, we‚Äòve just had a cool conversation but she must have a really fucked up personality, must be a really shitty person, how the hell did I not notice while talking to her

or about two years ago (that‚Äòs when I gave up trying to make the first move due to the experiences) it happened around 4 or 5 times that I had a very nice conversation with a guy, sometimes even like a date, but them also, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM them asked me so, when was your last relationship - and then, when I say I never had one they either laughed or also had that look on their face like damn, this is not normal, she is probably not normal, shit, I should run away and break off any contact with her - which also happened. this small piece of information totally destroyed the conversation, no matter how good it had been. and none of them ever wanted to see me again (except for two if them who basically immediately said hey, I like you as a friend and I see them from time to time when they meet up with several friends and I am also invited)"

I am a bit ashamed of thinking like this because I am actually not interested in hook-ups, I want a serious relationship that is about how you are connecting with the other personal on a mental level and in terms of character, interests et cetera. but my inexperience makes me super insecure and I am ashamed of it.

honestly, I am not sure. I was also hesitant to even ask the question because I was thinking the same ... if you feel uncomfortable about it, delete it
but by now it‚Äòs maybe also an ‚Äûolder‚Äú post and not too many people will discover it?"
Borderline,fn7ebpt,t1_fn79qzq,1586718635.0,"like you say, she is still proud of you for having told her and she will be even more proud of you when you manage to stop the self-harm again now!
and wow, you did the stitches yourself! you are beyond strong ... really. I hope I am not triggering you with this question but how did it feel, if I may ask? I mean, from my own experience I unfortunately know that one self-harms for various reasons but one WANTS to hurt oneself in that moment. but when you‚Äòre doing the stitches you maybe don‚Äòt want to hurt yourself ... right? do you know what I mean?
but feel free not to answer that! 
in any case I wish you all the best and a good next session with your therapist and of course clean scars!"
Borderline,fn77648,t1_fn6otte,1586714607.0,I am glad to hear that and it was very strong and brave of you to talk to your therapist at a time when you were so down and distressed - I am certain he/she will be supportive and helpful the next time you meet and help you make more progress and return to a self-harm free life!
Borderline,fn6m2og,t1_fn5uggh,1586702581.0,"hey there ... nobody will hate you!! not for self harming and not for anything else!
it‚Äòs good you let it out - I hope you‚Äòre feeling a bit better now. like someone said above, please take care of the open wounds and we believe in you - you‚Äòve already managed not to cut yourself for 1,5 years, now you‚Äòll manage double of that at least!!"
