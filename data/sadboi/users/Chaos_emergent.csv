I entered into the USMC summer 1999. And only because a friend of mine was standing in the Marine's recruiting office when I went in to talk to the coast guard.

My situation was bad. I had been homeless and addicted to drugs. I came from a very broken home and joining the military was an escape. I had no idea what I was doing, but I didn't care, I wanted immediate change. And when in, I did my best to be the best. I didn't like who I was and I wanted the military to change me into someone better. For a time it did.

I got a meritorious mass from school of infantry and later graduated as top of my class for armorer school. I was then selected to be the armorer for recon in Okinawa. There I got to do a lot of fun, but very difficult things. My CO wanted all us POGs to be able to deploy with the recon platoons, so I went through a lot of additional training outside of my MOS.

After being in for nearly two years, I ran into a underground party scene, and caved in when given drugs. I quickly started using a lot and was right back into my old habits. I was stupid and got caught. My career immediately came to an end. I was also made an example where in a battalion formation, I was busted down and put on barracks arrest. I was discharged two months later. And a couple months after that was 9/11.

I suspect had I not been caught, I would have seen combat and I doubt I could of actually handled it. In a way drugs saved my life, removing myself from the possibility of being harmed or harming others. For a time I really regretted how it ended. And If I could do it all over again, I would. I'd make sure I stayed clear of the drugs. But I'd also stick to the original plan of coast guard."

I took up snorkeling and would go out exploring the reefs and a small island with a lighthouse about 25 min off shore(I was stationed at camp Schwab). On the island, there was a underwater cave that went through and exited on the other side of the island.

This inspired me to find other ”caves”, which were more like holes in the coral. I found one I could see light on the other side. So I decided to go for it. The coral was razor sharp and the hole narrowed to a point where I became pinned. I was about 15ft or 20ft under the water. I immediately fell into a calm and I began digging at the sand to open up the hole. I dug for at least a min and made the hole big enough I could slowly move through.

Once I cleared the coral and exited the hole, my lungs felt like they were gonna explode. I swam for the surface as fast as I could, gasping and huffing for air once I surfaced. I was by myself and could have easily have died and no one would have known where I disappeared to.

I stopped swimming through the coral after that."

I was non-verbal mostly until age 4. I ended up getting a diagnosis of ADHD. My father had a psychotic break when I was 13 or so, dont remember exactly. And his diagnosis was narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, bipolar one. I was physically abused growing up, and punished for things that were part of what made me different.

As a teen I got into drugs, and on one occasion of using acid, I had a psychotic break. I thought a demon attacked me and stole my soul, leaving me soul less. I chocked it up to being a bad acid trip, but one that took over a year to recover from. I didn't seek help, and eventually became homeless.

Slowly I kinda found a new normal and managed to put a life together with the help of friends and who would become my first wife. I was horrible anti social though and preferred being home and on my computer. Over time I began to believe I was autistic as well.

Fast forward to when I was 38, my wife and I had a horrible fight that sent me into a deep depression. A couple months later my estranged father contacted me that he thought he was dying and wanted to see me. I immediately began hallucinating, hearing things. And when I did go to see him a couple weeks later I had fallen into compete psychosis. I was very delusional, thought I was the anti Christ and that Christians wanted to kill me among other things. But this time I couldn't manage and sought medial help immediately.

It's been a year and a half and I've mostly recovered. I'm medicated still and will probably be going forward.

AskReddit,fje1i6b,t3_fctfzr,1583263390.0,"I was a vegetarian that became vegan because my wife at the time (who was also vegetarian) loved cooking and decided to start making vegan foods. She made really delicious meals. But as for myself; I hate cooking. When my marriage came to an end, and I had to start making my own food. I quickly returned to being vegetarian and ultimately to a no restrictions diet.

In the 8 years I refrained from eating animals, I never thought I'd return to doing so. But laziness won and now I do. And as my daughter once said: 'but animals are delicious!' (when asking why I didn't eat them)"
cosmology,fika48m,t1_fijj1ed,1582476246.0,"The big bang theory is like evolution. It in itself describes how a smaller, hotter universe evolves into the universe we see today. It says nothing about what banged or how.

Inflation similarly doesn't describe what banged either. however it does describe how immediately after that event (and with a very tiny amount of mass), how the universe became isotropical and homogeneous.

AskReddit,fik8hee,t3_f87myj,1582475187.0,"I don't believe in souls. I think it's evident that the structure and workings of our brains is what makes us 'us'. When that structure eventually goes away, so shall I. Most of all time that structure will be missing from the universe, so for the limited time it does exist it's important to continuing it.

I believe this makes existing the most important thing that anyone can do. The experience of existing is a spectrum and can be heavenly to hellish. But experiencing it is worth it no matter how hard or hurtful it can become. Because no other time in the universe will I exist (or will any other individual)."
schizophrenia,fi94x34,t3_f715nc,1582255661.0,"I left my wife in August. We had a open relationship. But the breaking point was when she put her others over me as her priority. It hurt just as much as being cheated on. We always said we were the number 1 for each other. To then be number 2(and you tell her that's not ok) broke my heart. And just before Valentine's my since her girlfriend broke up with me. Now I'm mildly sad, but I really don't want anyone else. I just want to be happy on my own. Sorry you're hurting. I sympathize"

AskReddit,fh30f0u,t3_f15nbj,1581263193.0,"I was a teen, maybe 17. I was walking home and a car full of girls pulled up beside me. The girl in the passenger seat called out to me. they were looking for someone and asked if I knew where he lived, I didn't. They then all started taking amongst themselves. The girl in the passenger seat then asked if I wanted to go to a house party. I accepted immediately. I didn't realize until I was in the car that one of the girls was one from school whom I disliked. She however really liked me. 

Fast forward to late into the night, I'm smashed and stumbled out to the backyard where I passed out and threw up several times in the lawn. I only have fractional memories from this point on. I was helped onto my feet and walked into the house. I remember falling onto a bed and then sometime stripping me. I remember get a blowjob until I was hard and then she got on top. I remember sex happened in a couple positions but I lost consciousness. 

The next morning I was being ridden by her again. but I was hungover and the pressure on my stomach caused me to throw up. It was the girl I didn't like. Everybody else was gone and I was a town over. So she gave me a ride home. I threw up 2 more times, those were inside her car. At school the next week she asked me out (again) and I (again) told her I didn't like her. She then spread a rumor about how I asked her out and then dumped her as soon as we had sex. Nobody believed me that I was raped while blacked out. I was viewed as a asshole and not to be trusted."

askscience,fgg8m9c,t1_fgfpnea,1580756598.0,"You're incorrect. PBS spacetime has a great video explaining how tides work. I'd link the video, but I'm on phone. Basically, it's a buildup of pressure over the entirety of the Earth, which is why only the oceans have tides. If it was because the Moon's gravity is stronger, being closer to certain areas of the Earth. Then everything would be pulled and not just water. Which would negate any observed difference."
