BPD,fr01b45,t3_giuypt,1589780853.0,I was honest with a friend about how something she said made me feel and she was so understanding! She made be me feel secure in our friendship and Iâ€™m glad I was vulnerable
BPD,fr0139a,t1_fqv65a2,1589780680.0,"You can change it! I believe in you. I was fucking tired as hell two years ago. I was so ready to leave everything. But Iâ€™m tell you as someone who has bpd and has done dbt. After two years it has helped so much. Keep going, you are strong and can get through this! The hard, grueling work is so worth it, and you are so close to the other side."
gayrelationships,fpncaep,t1_fpmztq6,1588757817.0,Haha thatâ€™s so funny I think everyone assumed I was a guy from the post but Iâ€™m actually a girl ðŸ˜‚ but Iâ€™m glad you are able to still be friends with him! Iâ€™m sorry heâ€™s homophobic but glad to hear that itâ€™s getting better! Iâ€™m 21 and sheâ€™s 19

dating_advice,fpmx7yd,t1_fpmutfi,1588744109.0,I can totally let you know what happens lol! But itâ€™ll probably be a little bit
relationship_advice,fpmu3ai,t1_fpmtdkt,1588741761.0,Yeah I think thatâ€™s a really good idea. I donâ€™t want her to feel pressure at all
relationship_advice,fpmu10j,t1_fpmt7it,1588741712.0,Thank you so much for your input!! I will see what she says
dating_advice,fpmty18,t1_fpmszdu,1588741647.0,Thank you so much for your advice! I definitely think that if she doesnâ€™t feel the same way we can remain friends. Iâ€™m glad you and your best friend are still close even though you felt different things over time.
dating_advice,fpmsugt,t1_fpmsqjy,1588740805.0,Iâ€™m actually a girl so the gay part helps me out ðŸ˜‚but I get what you mean i could definitely go after someone else who I already know is interested
insomnia,fmh5f5o,t3_fv8wrd,1586067335.0,"Dude thatâ€™s rough and Iâ€™ve been there! Iâ€™m also 20 and am having trouble sleeping. Lavender and calming music really helps me. Also going to bed and waking up at the same time is good. And sometimes you just canâ€™t sleep, so in those times I find itâ€™s good to do something productive until I feel tired enough. I hope this helps!"
