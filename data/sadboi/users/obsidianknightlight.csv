I have a physically strenuous job that I depend on to survive and live, so this has been monumentally the hardest thing to do since the accident.

I also suffer from PTSD and struggle to heal with physical contact, but I really wanted to give it all to try.
I sought treatment from a chiropractor, it was clear from the get go that my body was fighting back with so much force.

I have had to advocate and relentlessly communicate my needs, it's almost as exhausting as the pain but I can't give up yet."

I have been to countless therapist, social workers, psychiatrist and by no means were they all helpful or safe resources. It took me a really long time to advocate for myself and I still struggle with it everyday, especially with authority figures like medical pros. I myself don't have a therapist right now because I felt like I had reached a peak in the ways he was able to help, I do a lot of my own healing these days.

Trusting people when you have been hurt is so incredibly difficult, but trusting your gut literally is my guide. 

I know I need to make the push and get a new one even if it is over video chat/phone (due to lockdown), but I try to remind myself that I only have this moment and that my illness will likely follow me (in some ways) for the rest of my life.
Being patient with yourself, allowing all the feelings (even and especially the bad ones) is imperative to finding a safe place for yourself. 

Do you have health insurance?
Are you able to seek another therapist with better experience?

Sending you the very best üíú"

Depression is something that can run in your family, you may have been born that way.

I can remember being depressed as early as 5 but not knowing the word related to that feeling until I was in my teens like you.

You aren't alone, in my experience depression hides trauma until you are ready to face it without self judgement.

You got this."
