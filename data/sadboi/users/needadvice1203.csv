Divorce,fpt1ncu,t1_fpswqop,1588883305.0,"I completely hear you and feel all the same things. I have already noticed and called my ex out on things he does for her but refused to do for me. When we were buying our house, he didnt want to live in any of the areas I suggested and wanted a bigger place than I felt we needed - now they are wanting to take the buyout money I'm paying to go get a small place in the area I wanted. He also wanted a dog and refused to help care for her once we got her - now they want to adopt a dog. They actually want kids now after he told me he no longer wanted kids. He came by our house to work on divorce papers and he told me she was ""uncomfortable"" with him being alone with me - the fucking audacity of his mistress being offended by MY husband hanging out with me in OUR home! So unfortunately, I know first hand it's a possibility he will magically become better for her. And dumb shit will hit you wrong - he sent me a picture of our cat (who moved with him) on the couch and I saw in the background an armoir that is clearly hers, with her belongings on it, next to our old entertainment center and a photo of our dog. Like I was just snipped out of my own life and she fit right in. It just stinks.

But again, fuck him. If he could do it for the side chick, he should have done it for his wife. Period. He is the one who made the cowards choice and took the easy way out by starting over instead of working at what he had. And the grass isnt always greener.  It's so hard as early in as where you are, but time really does change things. Focus on yourself, and remember that he doesnt deserve you. Anyone who would behave this way toward you is doing you a favor by setting you free. Make that your mantra and do your best to not check up on his life. The less I know about my husband and the homewrecker, the better! Make you a priority. It feels impossible to get through, but you will. And you arent alone!"
Divorce,fprxhxd,t3_gf6paw,1588863895.0,"I totally feel you and I'm so sorry you're going through this. Your story sounds very similar to mine. Husband just took off without considering working on us and moved right in with a coworker we had spent a year arguing over. I know deep down HE is the one at fault here (in our marriage anyway - her and her fiance also argued about my husband and she left him the same way) but I hate her just as much. It pisses me off his family and friends are casually accepting her - she destroyed my marriage! She doesn't deserve to be happy. Yet he is giving her all the things I begged for in our marriage and couldn't get from him.

Its rough, but eventually you do reach a point where you can use this pain to your advantage. Look at what he did to your marriage and how poorly he treated you. Do you think you deserve that? You don't. You deserve better. And he just did you a favor by showing you his true colors and freeing you up to find better! Get through the divorce and live your life. She can have him.

Here if you ever need to chat"
Divorce,fpnyk2w,t3_ge9nxv,1588775126.0,"Ah, the question I ask myself all the time. I'm 4 months in and still going through the same cycles, but more often positive than not now. I'd say you're just going through the normal processes. Even though they weren't the partner you thought you signed up for, and they weren't great for/to you, it still hurts to lose them and the future you envisioned. You're basically starting over, and that's not easy! No one can expect you to be perfectly okay and rational all the time. Give yourself time and just remember that you're not alone! And your future is all yours now to do whatever you'd like. That's something great. Message me any time if you want to just vent or chat it out, I'm slightly ahead of you on a very similar journey so it might help us both. :)"

Divorce,foouh7b,t1_foou1om,1587946719.0,"I did the same before I got my new job. I took way too much time off just to cry all day. Same here too, he keeps acting like I'm a psycho for feeling this way.  We argued about her non stop before he left cause I knew something fishy was up, and he acts like just because he didn't fuck her til he left he did nothing wrong. You still lied to me to see her, you still jumped right into bed with her, you still completely replaced your wife with her in an instant after saying being married was too much responsibility and you wanted to be single. Um?? If you can work it out for her, you could have with your WIFE if you really wanted to. It kills me I still want to see a message from him so badly. And when we do talk I just bent out how i feel and he never cares. Reasoning does nothing. It's pointless. Gotta just move along"
Divorce,footjgq,t1_fooskn3,1587946154.0,"Isn't it incredible? Oh I miss you, I regret leaving, this was such a mistak-- oh nvm now my side bitch is available, I'm good, see ya later wife! But somehow he truly does not feel any of his actions are wrong because ""we're separated"" so ""it's not cheating"". We haven't even filed anything, and you have a LIVE IN GIRLFRIEND that started up a week after we made a plan to work shit out. If you have a plan to reconcile, you aren't entirely single to me. Idk where your moral compass is, but that seems fucked.

Hang in there too! I hate that anyone else has been through this but at least were not alone."
legaladvice,fen2qzk,t1_fen2e04,1579275677.0,"In our case the only asset we own is the house, both cars were leased individually. The debt for us is all credit cards and we both initially started with a massive amount, almost $40k between us. Now its $3k a piece. But short of going back a decade and combing line by line idk how to decide what's ""fair"" other than just splitting it and walking away."
legaladvice,femzm8b,t1_femzgkk,1579273631.0,We did originally discuss a mediator but once we sat down and wrote up everything it didn't seem like we needed one cause we surprisingly agreed on everything. I think I'll recommend we do it anyway. I'm pretty sure he is just realizing that he is going to struggle on his own and not have the lifestyle he got used to having with my income.
legaladvice,femy5tj,t1_femxv9a,1579272631.0,"Honestly I just forked over half my savings to him and am stuck in this house paying the mortgage, I won't be able to afford buying my own place unless I get every penny I'm owed from the sale of the house back and even then it'll be tight. Whatever the lawyer costs, it's going to screw me over paying it. That was why we agreed to just mediation/filing ourselves. Do you know if he can still go back on it after the accounts are split and it's all said and done? Isn't his signature on all those things evidence enough that we agreed?"
legaladvice,femxtlc,t1_femx7z0,1579272392.0,"Also to add, his dad gifted us $8,000 when buying our house and signed an agreement that it was a gift. Now they are both butthurt that we are splitting the house equally. 1) I didn't ask for the divorce 2) I would have never accepted the money or bought the house had I known this 3) I paid pretty much all the bills while we were here. I feel bad his dad lost his investment but that is not my fault, he needs to take it up with his son."
legaladvice,femxkvz,t1_femx7z0,1579272225.0,"That's insane to me. We had equal debt years ago when we combined it all together, I have been running our finances all this time and have been moving it around as we pay it down to keep the interest low. The balance is now less than 1/4th what it was then thanks to MY responsible planning and MY income. He agreed to taking half and it's already done now. It seems insane to me that I can end up owing him money because he spends recklessly and can't follow a budget. I paid his credit cards off every month. This month I paid over $500 which is nearly a third of his entire monthly income. I can't afford a lawyer so I guess I will be fucked if he doesn't go back to our original agreement."
Divorce,femouim,t1_fem61ru,1579265089.0,You're singing to the choir here. We bought a house and were trying for a baby a year ago. Adopted a dog 4 months ago. Then he drops this bombshell on me. What happened? And I've asked if its life in general he's unhappy with or me and he seems to go back and forth. Everyone says cut your losses and go like it's obvious but it's not to me. I picked him for life and meant that. Definitely a mindfuck but we will get through it in time I'm sure. Hang in there and feel free to message me anytime to vent it out!

Divorce,feflegq,t1_fefl6wf,1579058813.0,I don't live nearby per se but I can check it out. I'm guessing once I have a little more time to think I'll come to my senses and just file. Each day I feel a little more like this is irreparable anyway.
Divorce,fef97mz,t1_fef8eg8,1579051160.0,"I did bring that up to him today, that I want something in writing and legal revoking any claim he has to my new place or mine to his. He agreed but we need to figure out how. I asked if he just wanted to divorce instead of separating but he wants to separate too. It's a mindfuck, to me a separation is temporary to make a decision but we are selling our god damn house. It doesn't FEEL temporary or like theres much to decide. And being the blindsided one I am in no shape to make the decision right now to formally divorce."
Divorce,fef7avr,t1_feevbzi,1579049873.0,My mind has come to terms with that but my heart hasn't. I'm basically doing all I can to push the baby bird out of the nest but set him up to succeed. If he fails none of it was worth it and I wont trust his intentions if we reconcile. If he succeeds and still comes back then I'd be open to it. Just shitty it has to happen.
Divorce,fef73nm,t1_feevoy8,1579049739.0,"I have done that actually. I made him a spreadsheet of all his bills that does the math right there for him from income to payment to due dates, lays out all the interest rates on his cards, websites where to pay etc. Pulled all our utility bills for an entire year we lived in our apartment to give him a guage. Friday we are going to go open him a bank account with some cash back offerings and get his name off mine, redo his direct deposit, split our savings and debt in half. I'm literally holding his hand through it as much as I can cause it makes me feel better, I want him to succeed otherwise none of this was worth it. But no matter what it's still gonna suck for him at some point and I cant drown with him."
Divorce,fef6qg0,t1_feeyzgs,1579049491.0,We are in Michigan so I'll check. Idk it just seems stupid to blow thousands on a lawyer if we are in agreement on selling our only shared asset. Everyone always pushes that but I dont have the money and we aren't arguing about it. If he starts pushing back then absolutely I'll be fighting back but I honestly dont care about anything we have except our pets enough to spend money on it. I just want a clean break so I can heal.
Divorce,feeuuvk,t1_feetzca,1579041709.0,"Awesome, where can I find more info on filing one? We did draft exactly that and have been negotiating it as time goes along but I wasn't sure how to make it enforceable other than taking it to a notary together"
Divorce,feeq430,t1_feepfva,1579038841.0,"Can you do just a separation agreement without filing for divorce? That sounds more like what we want to do. I do not plan on using lawyers at all, I can't afford one and as soon as I get one, his dad will throw all his money into getting him a way better one. I'd be shooting myself in the foot."
Divorce,feelo3s,t1_feei5tf,1579036273.0,"I have basically told him I'm not deliberately being shitty but I'm also not willing to drown with him in this, so he is going to be screwed if he doesn't move along on things. The only thing we are unsure on is officially filing. We agreed to a separation period for immediate financial and possible reconciliation down the line reasons (much of the issue is mental illness). But I want to cover my ass in the middle period."
Divorce,fedvgw0,t1_fedjmei,1579020749.0,"Literally every single person I've told about my husband surprising me with divorce has asked if he cheated, and when I say no they ask if I'm sure and try to convince me I'm wrong. There doesn't need to be some wild story!"
Divorce,fecluvz,t3_eofesm,1578977119.0,"As the blindsided spouse, it is what it is. I've accepted that no matter how comfortable and happy I was, he wasn't. It doesn't matter how much I love him or the future I saw with him, he doesn't share that. And because I do genuinely love him, I understand he has to do this and wish him happiness. None of that makes it hurt any less or make me feel any better, but life isn't fair. You are entitled to happiness. Go find it."
Divorce,feclerg,t3_eofo5v,1578976799.0,"My husband chose to end it and his dad sent me a really long and loving message about how much he cares for me and how sad he is this is happening and how he hopes I remain in their lives. I said a nice long goodbye and thanked him, but deep down I know I won't see him again. He was more like my dad than my real dad so it really hurts but I can't picture an interaction with him not being weird now. Same with my sister in law - we talk way more than she talks to my husband, but even since he told her we have talked less and less each day. I get it, you have to choose your actual relative.

RealEstate,feckdz2,t1_feck4lg,1578976052.0,"The irony of it all was that I was always very anti marriage. Always. Then idk what happened, it's like I got dumb overnight and blinked and now here I am, exactly where I always said I'd be if I got married. The love was incredible but the loss just wasnt worth it. Nothing wrong with being together without the legalities. A very expensive lesson learned."

RealEstate,fecgcil,t1_fecg2c7,1578973247.0,Yeah I'm not sacrificing my perfect credit for his poor decisions. I make almost twice what he does and my credit is 800. I'd rather live here til I do have some money for the loss in that case. What a nightmare
RealEstate,fecfycw,t1_fecfkhc,1578972980.0,"Makes sense. At this point I hate to say it because the man was more of a father to me than my real one, but his dad is the one who paid our down payment. So technically we lost his money. As long as nothing has to physically come out of my bank account I don't care at this point. I just want to get past the imminent financial doom so I can truly mourn my marriage, cause right now surviving is my only focus."
RealEstate,fecfq8k,t1_fecfhkh,1578972828.0,"Unfortunately my car is leased, the house was our only asset. Given where I live and that I have a dog, I need to get some money down and a new mortgage for a trailer. Something really small but still technically a mortgage.

RealEstate,fecf44a,t1_fecey87,1578972418.0,I honestly want to dump it on him to pay if we take a loss since he is the one who pushed to buy the place and now he is the one initiating a surprise divorce. But we are doing everything without lawyers and if I piss him off then his dad can afford a way better lawyer than I can and I will be extra screwed. Hopefully our realtor can help me somehow.
RealEstate,feceu0r,t1_fece7kk,1578972229.0,"Does ""breaking even"" include all the fees? Right now our standing balance is $168k so if we sell for $185k and all the fees make it a wash for me personally, do they still consider that $19k a gain? I have no idea how this works so that might be a dumb question."
RealEstate,feceqm7,t1_fece8hg,1578972164.0,I'm hoping she can help me break even if I wait til spring. I have no way to pay anything if we take a loss on this. I certainly won't have any way to find a new place in that case and will have no where to go.

I'm going to meet with her tomorrow to tell her what's going on and get her take on it. This was our first house so i really have no idea. I feel terrible cause my FIL gave us the down payment and now we will not only lose that, but I am going to have to live in a shitty rental if I sell until I can build up a down payment. My husband really fucked me over doing this."
RealEstate,feccyb6,t1_feccl0a,1578971001.0,"I want to sell it very badly but cannot afford to take a loss on it right now and I keep seeing something about paying capital gains tax if you sell under 2 years. Plus, I wouldn't have a downpayment on a new place then and with a dog I really don't want to rent/go somewhere with no yard. Its really just shitty.

I can manage the payments and be ok, just not be able to build a good savings and I really don't need something this big. That was why I considered just staying for a year or two, to maybe make a little. But I'm concerned I won't make anything anyway and will have thrown money away for that time."
RealEstate,feccmvj,t1_feccdyh,1578970807.0,"How hard is it to sell by owner? I'd love to avoid paying commissions to someone but have no idea what I'm doing.

We met as little kids and started dating/got married as soon as I returned to town after college, and he went straight from his parents home into mine. So he claims he wants to take some time to be independent and find himself before deciding if he wants to remain in the white picket fence life.

But apparently I didnt commit the right actions.  Well no shit, if I dont know what the wrong ones are how can I do better? Open your mouth and say what's really going on and let me have the chance to work on it. Just saying you're unhappy isnt helping. All just a way to justify leaving and making the other person the villain in the story."
Divorce,fe9pyna,t1_fe8y9ri,1578940387.0,"This. My STBX did this to me. I was content and thought he was just going through some things, I tried to ask and he said it was temporary and not to worry. Then he blindsided me with wanting to divorce and said it's been an ongoing unhappiness. I will never forgive him for not just being honest with me before it got to this point. I feel totally used for my money and convenience I offer, he wasted a year of my life I could have been moving on."
Divorce,fe6a09m,t3_enoqga,1578885126.0,Mind if I ask how long it was before you began dating your new partner?

My husband started a serious bought of depression a year ago and I tried what I thought was my best to support him, but he seemed to get all his support from his work colleague (female). I don't believe they cheated but I do know she basically took my place as his support system and sensed it would come between us. A week ago he decided he wants to divorce. I dont blame her specifically and I'm grateful she supported him, but I totally believe he and I would be together if she hadn't come along. He doesn't even see that."

Divorce,fe31qzh,t1_fdm1tx3,1578845108.0,"It makes me feel good to see someone else did the same thing we did. We were really good friends for 11 years and we joke all the time that we have no idea why it suddenly changed overnight. We literally went to a friend's birthday party and shot pool and talked like we would any other day, but were an inseparable couple after that night. Now here we are 5 years later having the world's most amicable divorce. We got a contract written up splitting up all our assets and pets and the house within a week, no disagreements. Grabbed dinner and watched a movie together on the couch last night. Sleeping in separate rooms but still making each other lunch/coffee for work. In our case I'm still very sad the relationship part ended and would like to try saving it, but it's also really nice to just be friends again.

Divorce,fe2ihhb,t3_encspz,1578838706.0,"My STBHX keeps saying if he takes the space he wants and in a year or two he wants me back he will come home. It really irks me. Can I ask, how do you feel about that? Cause I can't decide. It makes me happy that there is hope, because I truly wanted him forever. But in the same breath, I feel like it robs me off my potential out on my own. If I go out and start seeing someone but don't LOVE them and he realizes he wants me back, what happens? Does he keep quiet and I lose my chance to have him without knowing it? Does he say something and make me decide between this new potential or going down a familiar road with him? It's just such an unfair thing to keep me on the back burner. Curious if you agree."
Divorce,fe0aa87,t1_fe0a3ut,1578807573.0,"Thanks, it's always good to have someone out there rooting for you! My father in law sent me a really beautiful message today saying he is shocked and thought we were great together, and he hopes we fight to keep our friendship cause itd be a shame to lose it after all this time. It was nice to know even his family is hoping we survive this together."
Divorce,fe09wck,t1_fe09pzv,1578807219.0,"I'm not even so much concerned with seeing him with someone. I know that will sting no matter how happy I am at the time. My fear is that our new partners will take issue with us being friends.  We encountered that a lot in the years before we dated each other, with out partners disliking us being close just cause we are the opposite sex, but now with the added factor is being exes we are really in for a fight. That's gonna be a battle I fear losing."
Divorce,fe09fjz,t1_fe08z73,1578806794.0,"I think we are. We grew up together and have always understood each other on a level no one else has. That's what led us to date to begin with. I thought it would be impossible to come back from this but so far we are. I'm sure once we start dating issues will arise with our friendship but I'm choosing to hope we end up with people who understand our connection. Outside of that I really believe that our bond will be safe. And if its somehow not, I'll always be grateful we had what we did."
Divorce,fe07lvo,t1_fe07fgh,1578805198.0,"It truly is. I honestly never questioned our relationship so in our case I was shocked. But the further we go into this and he opens up to me, the more I question my judgement. Maybe loving each other really isnt enough to sustain a lifetime together. And that realization is a bizarre and unique brand of pain."
Divorce,fe06rs6,t3_eni5db,1578804513.0,"I asked my STBXH that question and he openly admitted yes, he does. I told him I wake up some mornings and am just numb all day, others I cry non stop, others I'm positive and full of hope for the future. He said he does the same, even though he's the one who ended it. It makes no sense to me why he did it if he feels that way, but it is what it is."
Divorce,fddz4te,t1_fddydm3,1578327482.0,"That's going to be the most challenging part for me. Before he pulled away this past year, we used to spend a lot of time together. Hobbies and free time were spent and done together. We basically went to work at our respective jobs and came home to each other. After he started to pull away my big hobby was this house and our dog (who I'm keeping). My friends all live far away so I rarely see them. So really once you remove the husband and house from the situation, I'm left with the dog and my job, and no local friends. And the dog has separation anxiety something fierce, so my hobbies will be very limited moving forward without someone else at home to keep her company when I do go out. And I really hate my job and was in the middle of looking. So it truly feels like I've got nothing now. I truly never even thought of a life without him and never built the foundations for one."
Divorce,fdduxdj,t1_fddun4z,1578324593.0,"That's the thing, he has always been very good to me. When he is depressed the worst he does is pull away or lash out, but he always comes around and recognizes it and fixes it. I know its not in his control. I've fully accepted him in every way, and he has done the same for me many times. I don't know where all of this is coming from that he thinks he's so awful to me. I just don't want anyone else... I don't want to lose my house, his family, our friends, our life. I have no interest in starting over and it feels unfair I was so blindsided."
anhedonia,fdckiit,t1_fdcgrlt,1578277169.0,"I tried explaining that to him but he refused to hear it. You can't make judgements about the future when you're in that place in your mind. You're probably right about rock bottom, it just breaks my heart to picture him there without me..."
anhedonia,fdcbs5u,t1_fdbmvcw,1578271144.0,"Does it ever get any better? His depression has always come and gone, but he is fully convinced this is permanent and it truly has been a long time... it just makes me sick thinking of him alone going through this."
anhedonia,fdbx76w,t1_fdbatl4,1578263333.0,"I can give that a shot but he gets very angry and defensive at the mention of medication. I've signed myself up for tele therapy to see how it works for me... if it goes well I'll pitch that to him. But so far its been over 3 hours since messaging my therapist for the first time and she hasnt replied so, not great."
anhedonia,fdax8wt,t1_fdawtx0,1578251461.0,He wouldn't be able to because of his job and he has always been very anti drugs. Im even struggling to pitch simple diet and exercise changes to him. He literally just believes he will be this way forever no matter what and everyone close to him should just stop trying.
depression,f80e6z7,t3_dyazjo,1574126919.0,Unfortunately I have this thought all the time. I don't want to hurt my family by committing suicide and I'm very afraid of trying and failing and dealing with the aftermath. But if I got in a bad car accident or fell ill...  it would be such a relief. I'm sorry to hear you have the same thoughts.
depression,f7zdy5e,t1_f7zdc3g,1574109282.0,"I did openly ask him if he was 100% sure he had no feelings for her romantically and he swore he didn't. I want to believe that but he seems to prioritize her needs over mine more and more as time goes on. I don't at all think he would cheat or intentionally ""preset"" himself up with someone else. But for all I know he is doing it subconsciously. Anytime I've tried to press him on if we are going to work on this or if he is done, he says he doesn't know how he feels. We usually say I love you a million times a day, but I've gotten basically a handful of ""you too""s from him at best. I can't stand not knowing but I know I can't force him to figure it out either. It's just so hard to get by in the mean time."
depression,f7zcddj,t1_f7za57j,1574108622.0,"He has seen me crying and doesn't appear to care. He just wants to be as far from me as possible it seems. He says he wants time alone but all I can think is that is just giving him time to get over me. He says he ""doesn't know how he feels"" and ""things change"". 4 days ago we were doing great. I can't wrap my mind around having a beautiful evening with your partner one day and then considering divorce the next. And yes of course one of his new friends is a woman. She is engaged and he swears they are ""like bros"" and I havent been suspicious when I've seen them together.  Hes a great man though and her fiance is a tool. I'm sure if he suddenly became single. She would consider the switch. I wouldnt blame her."
