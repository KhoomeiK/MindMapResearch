Anxiety,fkanrw6,t3_eupik4,1584014648.0,"I need to get this out as if I speak to people I know it's either making it worse or I feel they dont care enough.

I'm super anxious about the virus. Im in the uk and currently in the area I am there are only about 4 confirmed cases at time of writing (I think anyway) so I've been fairly calm about it. Going to work as normal and stepping up my hand washing routine and just generally trying to be clean and conscious about the situation.

Obviously things have stepped up in the last few days and now I feel like it's starting to build my anxiety about it. Not so much of dying, more about other people. Are they taking this seriously? What if they have it and dont know and are just walking round? I'm meant to go to comedy show tonight, what if the person I'm next to hasnt washed their hands....you can see where I'm going. Flicking through this thread has helped a little, I know I'm not at risk, I'm in my 20s and have no underlying health issues that I know of, but I am super aware my parents are or I have friends with young babies...its all just seemingly kind of scary right now and I'm having a hard time shutting my brain off."

Literally worried longer about the phone call than how long I was on the phone for 🙄"
