SuicideWatch,fffq98q,t1_ffea1wf,1579889451.0,"Yes there is. I lost my little dog, my canine carer a month ago
I have never liked or wanted children. 
My dogs are my family. My loss of her makes me want to die everyday. The guilt I feel that she didn't live out her lifespan. The fact that I took her to a crap vet who overdosed her by mistake and murdered her. The fact that I can't replace her. I am now alone with my elderly dog.. I got a new dog off a freesite. But she was my little joy.. The most innocent little creature in the world. The world is a shittier place for her loss."
SuicideWatch,ffcs9kp,t3_esu65u,1579806213.0,"I also struggle with disabilities and feel that I don't want to be alive..
However I have zero friends and only a vile abusive family. I don't die because my 12 year old dog needs me. When she goes I'm out of here.. 
You fetched your kids into this world. You are also responsible for your animals.
Unfortunately you owe them all something.. Despite your pain. 
As your kids will not get over your suicide, and your pets may end up getting euthanized you really have no choice but to live..."
SuicideWatch,ffbylmi,t3_esra0g,1579786883.0,"I won't be like the others trying to talk you out of it.
Let me just say that when I was 15, I was homeless.. I wanted to kill myself often.
I took more drugs then. 
I have a lifelong physical disability and learning disability. 
I am now gonna be 47 on a couple of weeks. 
The years from then to now I have lived have been filled with a lot of misery, abuse, tears, a  few short moments of laughter that brings more fear as I know they will end.. I wish I had the courage to have ended my life back then.. Since it's been pointless ever since.."
