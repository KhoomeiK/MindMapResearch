SmallYTChannel,f7ab6al,t1_f7a1k73,1573525032.0,thanks man I appreciate it !givelambda
SmallYTChannel,f6ohyrv,t3_druwit,1573018552.0,Wow this is such an original concept/idea. The thumbnail was engaging/perfect as well. Keep it up is all I've got!
SmallYTChannel,f6ohnip,t3_ds7ao5,1573018213.0,no real feedback other than I support this. just another reason to be a dog guy smh!!
SmallYTChannel,f6ohjao,t3_ds7oz4,1573018091.0,so confused. was that the intended result?
SmallYTChannel,f6ohe90,t3_ds5lpi,1573017946.0,"no real feedback other than I love your videos, keep it up, and now I want to go to Edinburgh!"
SmallYTChannel,f6ogu6j,t3_dsag8q,1573017380.0,I just liked that it wasn't IN YOUR FACE typical vlogging...very chill/relaxing
SmallYTChannel,f6lco5n,t3_drqlp8,1572937953.0,I think it's a cool concept but I'd add an intro to get everyone on the same page about what it is you do on your channel.
SmallYTChannel,f6lcet6,t3_drr9lo,1572937587.0,"I think this concept is interesting, but I would make shorter videos about specific van life topics, especially to start! First thought that popped into my head when you started talking was....""I wonder what their van looks like"" (aka van tour video)"
NewCountry,f6lbri6,t3_drld3i,1572936695.0,Yeehaw!
SmallYTChannel,f5yz24e,t3_dppqi0,1572563913.0,"Dude this was awesome! I've been seeing this Andy wondering about it and now I feel informed. 

I liked the lights in the background. Been thinking of doing that myself and I felt like it worked. Good video man keep it up!"
country,f5thck1,t3_dp7bhb,1572458656.0,"There needs to be a better way to support new/up and coming talent that doesn't want to sell their soul to a label. Spotify, apple music, etc ain't it. I think it's a money/industry problem, not a talent/shallow problem"
SmallYTChannel,f4u7t4j,t3_dl7dg6,1571801448.0,I do this all the time too...but screw a disclaimer dude! We want to hear what you have to say! I think people could be tempted to click away during the disclaimer. Awesome quality and video though...you're way ahead of me there.
SmallYTChannel,f4u757h,t3_dlfog6,1571800922.0,You're funny man! I made a video with the same premise so I think this stuff is hilarious too. I would have ended this video at 4 minutes to keep everything on topic (like some of the other people have said)...but you should definitely feel like you can fall back on the observational humor you've got.
SmallYTChannel,f4u6n0p,t3_dlipxd,1571800528.0,Love this concept! I'd invest in lav microphones if you want to make more like this. It will help with wind and you won't have to hold your phone up to your mouth. You can get some really cheap ones that plug into your phone on Amazon.
SmallYTChannel,f4u62dj,t3_dlrbml,1571800093.0,"I thought the audio was great! Didn't realize ""first time using voice over"" meant first time you spoke in your videos (checked out some of the other ones on your channel). Keep doing the voice overs! It was really interesting! Where do you get your music? I really like that across your videos."
GetMoreViewsYT,f4u3ler,t3_dlly9d,1571798264.0,"Left a comment, but try mixing in some plant-based/vegan stuff!! I was in the same place as you, and I can't recommend at least trying it enough. Good luck man!"
