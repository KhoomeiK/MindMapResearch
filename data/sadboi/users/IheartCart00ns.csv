After volunteering for several non profits in my area, a volunteer I used to mentor started threatening me. After months of harassment, stalking, a physical assault, and being roofied at a bar, I was terrified and at my breaking point. I shared with my best friend that I was scared my only option was to move away and start over someplace else, and her sociopathic tendencies took over and she decided that if I was going to leave it would be on her terms, not mine. She shared intimate knowledge of previous abuse and triggers, so I was being bullied non stop by coworkers, and upon stupidly reaching out for help to my family, they agreed with her because I'm ""not perfect either."" After my suicide attempt, she made sure I was fired from my job of 10 years-- the owner of the practice said I wasn't ""happy enough"" to work there anymore. 

What did I learn? Never ask for help, and only express myself and vent my feelings where I am anonymous and no one can get to me."
