TooAfraidToAsk,f9slv8e,t3_e6lrjb,1575594885.0,"I'm no parent but I am the oldest daughter (26) and my sister (19) is expecting a baby. As a maturish adult I do understand that babies are more important, and that mother's get distracted. 

Have you talked to her about this? Just said ""hey I'm sorry, I feel like I'm not paying attention to you enough but hormones and the baby and all that... Do you forgive me?"" Or something along those lines? She's a grown woman, I'm sure she'd understand if you showed her the respect you tell us you want to. Just by being honest."

NO

Absolutely not.

I don't care how much you feel guilty for his needs. You're a compassionate, caring person, nothing wrong in that, but don't mistake that for a loving relationship that is equal. I have similar issues where my partner doesn't pay rent, but hey, at least she buys me food and things and shows she cares off her paycheck. Yours sounds like a complete mooching gold digger. I can't even imagine the concept of paying full rent in two places just so he could live alone. 

If you're partners and laying his rent you should be living together, not being his sugar momma while he's free to do whatever else he pleases... Sure maybe he can't live with you where you live, but if you two are a couple and you plan to spend the rest of your life with him, you should have thought about getting a place together sooner. If he doesn't agree? Sorry girl, you're being used. Good luck"

Of course I also have a rep payee who made me homeless once before and is threatening to do it again, yet I'm too stupid to figure out how to stop her and legal advice told my throwaway account to just have myself committed for life if I'm too mentally ill to figure it out on my own... 

Yeah, really not sure if it's the toxic environment or my chemistry. If you're asking this to figure that out too, good luck. I think it's often times both. Hope to have helped somewhat!"
schizoaffective,f41qw67,t1_f41aoxu,1571322746.0,"I appreciate your polite defense, and I'm really not trying to offend you, I'm just trying to help OP (and you too lurkers!) avoid disastrous uninformed advice. Telling someone ""they're f*****-"" is just in poor taste as it's dangerous to tell someone to go off their medication. Especially when you don't know them, exactly why they're on it, and only know them via a post on Reddit.

 Just trying to help, I do wish you luck in finding good doctors. Personally, I've yet to meet a doctor who hasn't mistreated me as well. (For some reason my psych thinks my sexuality has something to do with my mental health and I just need antidepressants and a partner so trust me, I know exactly where you're coming from, but statements like that aren't ours to make) 

Once again, just trying to help OP avoid bad advice. Sorry that meant offending you"
schizoaffective,f415oza,t1_f40uhna,1571314835.0,"That's a horrible thing to say to someone. You also shouldn't put ideas of doubt into someone's head when they're literally stating they're feeling paranoid. Are you here for positive reasons or to troll the people looking for help? Sorry, but your reply is just plain dangerous to someone if they took your advice while in a bad state."
