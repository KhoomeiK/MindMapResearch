AskReddit,flnze8p,t1_flnxbz3,1585328765.0,"Some people use it as temporary. That was my plan. I stayed clean for 3.5 years the first time. Then relapsed & started h. Quit after 6 months due to a bad infection requiring surgery. Tried suboxone. Stayed clean 2 years. Relapsed for another couple years. Went back on methadone but kept using. Then I finally really quit. (still on methadone, but at proper dose) during this time I faced almost losing my son & actually losing my husband and step daughter.. After that I had a handful of relapses.. (All one time use, a month or 2 apart) then I quit. Partly because.. Long story short.. I don't drive, so my 70 yr old father drives me to my clinic which is about 45miles round trip.. & I wanted to give him a break... Along with giving myself & my son the sobriety we both deserve.

Anyhow.. Point being.. At least for now, methadone is not temporary for me... But at some point I still plan to get off of it, or at least switch to something else. I just have to go slow. Stop trying to rush it."
AskReddit,flnq17g,t1_flnp59e,1585323675.0,"Thanks! You too! No I'm not craving. Not at all. What a lot of people don't understand about methadone - if you're on the proper dose, you won't crave. If you are still craving you probably need to raise your dose. I'm on the lowest dose I can be without craving. I tried lowering my dose to switch to another med with less (for me) side effects.. But i went too fast & I went into almost full on withdrawal.. So I stopped & went back up a bit... But i was still craving.. So I went a bit more... When the craving stopped, I knew I was ok.

BTW I've been sober from alcohol for 15 years.. H, not even close to that long.. I had a relapse last year.. & I'm coming up on a year now.

I've been reading about how cortisol causes you to gain in the middle.. & the last 30 lbs I gained happened while having huge amounts of anxiety.. I'm starting to get the anxiety under control.. Or I was... Considering what's going on right now it's realllllly hard.

I'm naturally a tall skinny thing.. But, the anxiety/cortisol thing helps me understand why I gained so much so fast without really eating any different from before. I think I'm going to have to do OMAD in order to lose the weight again though.. Because I've always skipped breakfast.. So that's what I'm working towards. I'd really like to eat less processed foods too.. I know I eat too many. Hard to find motivation to cook just for myself.
