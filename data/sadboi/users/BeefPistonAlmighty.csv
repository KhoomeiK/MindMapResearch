Thanks for all the help and inspiration for diy projects! I understand definitely new things can be scary but yea Iâ€™ll make sure to give him his space. 
I appreciate you!"

Thatâ€™s exactly how his foster mom described him.
 Thanks for the heads up ahah I was going to go crazy spoiling him with toys that he might not even use. Thanks again I appreciate you!"
