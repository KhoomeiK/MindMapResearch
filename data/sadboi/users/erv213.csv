Some ive found interesting:
1. Undone Urban: its an interesting idea to allow you to customize your watches and it comes with a VK64 movement which ive had before and enjoyed til the watch i had got water damage. Vintage options for the watch are cool
2. HKed chronos- these use seagull movements(were swiss venus I believe) and are manual wind which i find amazing for so cheap. They‚Äôre essentially re-branded Seagull 1963 chronos
3. Yema Rallygraf- another Seiko meca-quartz watch that is really cool and has some history. Very impressed by it overall but there aren‚Äôt just tons of reviews on them"
