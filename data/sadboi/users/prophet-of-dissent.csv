Not to be ""that guy"", but your math is pretty off here. The reality for slavery as a legal matter was 89 years. The United States first declared independence in 1776, and abolished slavery with the ratification of a constitutional amendment on Dec 6, 1865. Anything prior to that was under English law, and everything after that was illegal.

I'm not trying to say black people are all ""fine"" now and that there's no racism anymore; I've personally seen it affect friends and even my college girlfriend. It's too prevalent to say it's not a serious problem still. But if we're going to have that discussion, at least get it right."
electronjs,fqd1qfg,t1_fq9ak30,1589276651.0,"The way I'd do this, because running a checksum on a multi-gigabyte file is very resource intensive (IO/CPU), is to have a version file or config.json or something specifying the version installed, then communicate with your game's website via an exposed API endpoint (something like www.example.com/api/v1/latest-version) that returns a JSON response, something like...

```
{
  ""latest"": {
    ""version"": ""1.0.3"",
    ""download-url"":""http://www.example.com/path/to/download.7z"",
    ""md5sum"":""abc123...xyz""
  }  
}
```

...or something (you could combine that with other metadata about the game and return it all as one payload).

Now, _after_ the file is downloaded, run an MD5 checksum on the file (I think Windows powershell has a way to do this but I'm not 100% sure) to be sure the file's checksum matches the published/correct checksum so you know the 7z file wasn't corrupted during download.

Additionally, I just remembered and verified something. To extract the file, it turns out that https://www.7-zip.org hosts a straight-up EXE that you can download. I'd just download that, skip the installer nonsense, and run that in a console (again, verify this works with research before you jump into implementing this approach).

By the way, I hear TMS (if it is what I'm thinking anyway) is usually done in conjunction with drug therapy. So maybe try a different antidepressant along with TMS at the same time. Ask your doctor about that.

Also, if previous antidepressants didn't work for you _at all_, ask your psych about the MTHFR gene mutation. In a nutshell, about 20% of people have this mutation in their genetic code (I'm one of them) that prevents your liver from creating the precursor chemical to a necessary neurological component called L-methylfolate. Without that precursor, L-methylfolate can't be created, and that's used in regulation and creation of various neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, etc. If those don't function right, nothing's going to work. You can supplement with synthetic L-methylfolate (prescription is called ""Deplin"" but it isn't covered by most insurance; OTC I use MethylLife 15mg, one of my past doctors told me it's the exact same thing) to help that balance out, but it's going to take a few months before it starts working. Running a genetic test will tell you if you have that gene mutation. Anyway, talk to your doctor about that too."

Check Yelp, Google, zocdoc etc. for psychiatrists in your area and call their offices. Tell them you don't have insurance and are a low-income person. Some clinics in various areas have programs to help low-income/uninsured people see a doctor and get medication. I was on one such program at one point in time and both the doctor visits AND the medication were completely free of charge, didn't cost me a cent. Ask the people who answer the phone at these offices if they know of anything like that; you might be surprised at what's available to you.

While still walking, I pulled out my phone and started looking for the nearest theater so I could look up what was playing and when. So there I am, walking down the street in Sydney, starting at my phone like an idiot when I tripped off the curb and fell into the street. 

IMMEDIATELY there were no less than three people offering to help me up. I picked myself up and thanked them, then owned my mistake by admitting it was my own damn fault for not paying attention. We all had a good chuckle about it then went our separate ways. 

As it turned out, I had a major cut on my knee and was oozing blood. But I didn’t notice that until half way through the movie. 😅 

The thing that stood out to me there was how much others cared about the well being of an idiot foreigner who skinned his knee due to his own idiocy. It was really nice to be in the opposite side of the planet and still have a human being give a damn about me, even if it was the smallest of damns."
AskAnAmerican,ffe3x03,t3_et1e77,1579836042.0,"Oh for sure. When I was in high school, I was on my way home from work one night and noticed a car broke down on the side of the road. This was before cell phones were common place, and usually only rich people had one. So I pulled over to see if I could help this person out. It was night and it was getting cold after all. 

The driver turned out to be this super nice Mexican guy (and I mean literally a Mexican, as in a citizen of Mexico) who’d come over the border earlier that day to visit family. He was SOOOOO appreciative and thankful that anyone had the kindness to pull over and see if he was OK.

So I ask if he needs a ride to the nearest gas station so he can call for help. Turns out this guy already called - from his fancy new fangled cell phone - and a tow truck was on its way. 

So we’re shooting the breeze for a minute (I speak zero Spanish and this guy is doing a great job with slightly broken English), and I asked what he does for a living down in Mexico. Turns out he was some kind of media big shot, knew all these famous actresses and such back home. “Aha,” I thought, “so that’s how he can afford a cell phone!”

This guy was so thankful for me just checking on him that he invited me to his house for dinner and promised to introduce me to several Mexican celebrities. I didn’t follow up on it because I was only 17 at the time and felt that would have been inappropriate  (assuming his claims to status were true), but all these years later I still remember that guy. First actual Mexican person I ever met (as opposed to Mexican-American), and he made a good impression with me so I never learned the typical racism toward Hispanics - because my own experience was very different from those negative stereotypes."
DeathStranding,ffbvx0t,t1_ffbtomm,1579784538.0,"Thanks for letting me know. I might just find a YouTube video to go over the story elements or something. Sounds like a very well-thought out story, character, history and so on, but the gameplay sounds just boring as hell. I appreciate the information."
golang,ffbsgn2,t1_ff6w9bw,1579781031.0,Upvoted for the pun of it.
golang,ff7ttwp,t1_ff7h1ws,1579658210.0,"Thanks for the reply, that was nice and clear. Makes a lot more sense now!"
Anxiety,ff6orzq,t3_ermpo1,1579631735.0,"Public speaking is a very strong fear for most people, and many of them fear public speaking more than death. So yeah, be proud of yourself! Way to go!

As someone who's had to do more than the usual share of public speaking in my career (software engineer), I figured I'd share a tip or two that might help you in the future.

For me, the number one fear-lessening thing that I do is I KNOW. MY. SHIT. I research the _hell_ out of anything I'm going to talk about, know it inside, out, backwards, forwards, upside down and even purple (joke there, dimensional change vs. color, lulz). Anything I'm asked about it, I can answer right there on the fly because I didn't memorize a series of words, I learned a hell of a lot about a specific thing.

I also go and loosely format a speech, using the slides as a reminder of what I'm going to talk about next. I put a bullet point on each slide to remind me the sub-topic, and order them in a way that makes sense and that I can later use while I'm on stage to help me remember, ""oh wait, what the hell was next again, what now?""

One thing I also like to do when appropriate is use audience members as metaphors. In college I gave a speech about how the internet works (as a relay system, just like a baton race - pass the baton to the next person, who runs it, passes it forward, and so on) and called up volunteers to the front of the class (the ""stage""). I then had them stand in a line and I had one end pass a copy of the US Constitution from them to the next person, to the next and so on until it got to the end person. To illustrate why encryption is useful, I had them do it again and I jumped in between two people to ""intercept"" the ""packet"" and show why if it's encrypted there's not much I can do without giving away the fact that I'm looking at data when I shouldn't be.

It's also good to have funny (not inappropriate) images for your slides. A little animated gif or small video is useful sometimes too. For example, I was giving a meetup talk once to a room of about 100 programmers, talking about a new version of some open source software that had just come out that day. I started the topic by saying something like ""first we're going to say goodbye to a few features - umm, bears, yeah I mean bears""; I clicked the button on the remote and the video I had of two trained grizzlies waving goodbye started to play. Another slide was about caching (a performance optimization technique) and I named it ""CACHE MONEY, BABY"" and put a picture of a kitten rolling in dollar bills down there. Just funny shit like that.

Hope this helps in your next speech. Good job on what you've done - it can only get easier and (hopefully) more fun from here!"

PERFECT. I often have this hurdle myself, finding a great exigence or a major plot point, but being unsure how to connect it with the rest of the story. Thanks!"
