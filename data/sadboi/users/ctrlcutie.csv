She said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but she kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúMa'am, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first India kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, India stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, India kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

I let my mind focus on  the job duties itself than how other perceived me. I had to speak to groups of kids everyday and that terrifies me. it still does but I've gotten better at it. it was one of my favorite part time jobs and I miss it.
