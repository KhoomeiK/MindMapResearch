I clean my sewing machines with compressed air and since he was a pup, my dog tries to attack the air stream. I have blown the air in my own face before ever doing it to my dog. He is a good boy and this is something he genuinely loves doing (but happens *maybe* once every 4 months or so).

Yes, they will need to be washed/replaced frequently. Yes, there are risks while using them but when the CDC is lowering their standards because our actual medical supplies are so limited, the benefits outweigh the risks. The risk is having zero PPE or having one that is not as effective as a surgical covering. 
Personally, I’m not blindly making masks and handing them out. I’ve been asked by several nurses/health care workers for some because their supplies are so exhausted or non-existent. I also have been hesitant to make some when everyone jumped on the bandwagon last week, because I knew how ineffective they would be. Now we are in the weeds of a very real crisis and if my homemade mask makes it so someone can get extra use out of their sterile/proper mask, then so be it."

WomensHealth,fkwgbsn,t1_fkwfnee,1584591687.0,"Ok. So, yes. I would say you’re stressed and your period is late. I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Birth control is also known to make periods lighter and shorter. Give it another day or two, if you’re still wicked stressed take another test and maybe call your doctor office’s nurse line. 

As for the pink tests, sometimes women in my mommy group would take a photo of the completed test and invert the colors. It makes any line that you can’t really pick up with the naked eye more noticeable. 

I’m sorry you’re so stressed over this. From what you’re describing though, I wouldn’t start worrying until it was past the time frame of your period (but that’s me personally)."
WomensHealth,fkwf4ex,t1_fkweu1f,1584590732.0,"How far past your missed period is this? I’ve never take the continuous pill, but there’s SO much that can disrupt your cycle if you’re getting negative pregnancy tests. Also what kind of tests have you been taking? The ones that are a pink line are easier to see a “faint” positive really early in pregnancy (women in my mommy group post theirs all the time). Any big changes in your life? All of these can contribute to relatively normal reasons to miss a period besides pregnancy.

Also, yes. Your best bet at trying a test is in the morning. Unless you’re JUST recently pregnant, it should have shown up. But what I’m really trying to say is, don’t stress it too much. Stressing over this alone can cause your period to be late."

Anxietyhelp,fk3xqi9,t3_fg9ksf,1583848875.0,"Yup. Hypochondria fueled by my “worst-case-scenario” kind of anxiety, that doesn’t let things go unless proven otherwise. Therapy helps. Being up front with your doctors (primary) helps. My doctors are well aware of my hypochondria, and will go out of their way to make me feel safe and work around triggering it. My primary also takes into consideration my anxieties when I’m having issues (I also have thyroid problems) so if ordering a test to calm my anxiety works, he does it. 

But I totally get you on feeling like everything is catastrophic. I used to think gas pains were my appendix about to explode, headaches made me think something was wrong inside my brain, etc. always my brain jumping to the absolute worst thing it could think of.

I constantly have to put myself back in check by telling myself it’s just my anxiety, and that I am fine (like a mantra). I try to meditate a lot, but honestly the thing that’s helped the most is being honest with doctors. Be up front and go to therapy. If they don’t take you seriously, find a new doctor.

I’ve had multiple blood tests, an MRI, exams, etc since the beginning of the year. Is there something in particular that’s triggering you? My best suggestion is to be completely honest with your health providers. I’ve warned every doctor I’ve seen that I am insanely anxious and a hypochondriac, and that my anxiety runs with the worst possible scenarios despite logic unless proven otherwise. It sucks. You legitimately feel insane. By telling my health providers, they take into account that my brain won’t let it go, and order tests to prove everything is alright. Maybe yours would be the same?
