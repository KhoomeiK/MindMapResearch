I just wish I could tell my parents that I was depressed and still kinda am, but I don‚Äôt want to put them through my shit, as much as anyone says I need to get help or tell my parents I just can‚Äôt, I have anxiety and that anxiety makes me think ‚Äúif I told my parents that I‚Äôm depressed my whole family will look at me differently‚Äù.

true statement but i feel like sometimes its good to talk to someone and vent how you feel or what your situation is. Yes, i like to help people but im not doing it to make myself look better i dont even care about me, i only care about caring for others and just being there for them in general. im sorry for wasting your time, youve probably seen alot of these comments already and i apologise, but this is just me putting it out there."

depression,fimotoq,t3_f8ko46,1582540515.0,"being so called ""ugly"" doesnt define who you are, so what!! you may not look the best on the outside but who cares, it only matters whats on the inside, think of yourself as a pistachio nut. they are not the best to eat with the outside shell still on but when you take off the shell whats inside is wayy better. who cares about what u look like, smell like, it only matters that your a good person in general. you may be wondering ""how does she know that im a 'nice person'"", well its simple. the best, kindest, caringest (thats not even a word), thoughtful people are the ones that get hurt the most. heres another thing, dont care about what people think or say about u, they dont realise how much of a good person they are hurting, dont call others beautiful, trust me, everyone has a piece of ugly, no one is perfect. anyway, im always here for a chat if needed, hope ur ok. hope this helped in some way. xx"
