I was planning to do this in the first place once their first wave hit, but it sort of just shocks me (in the most humorous way) that even when the girls are in this predicament, my male cat still finds them gross. An old bachelor at heart, he seems to be."

ADHD,f0iq318,t3_d4zt6y,1568645338.0,"As someone with ADHD who graduated recently (and whose thesis was actually on helping children and parents cope with ADHD), it helps being in the presence of friends who can keep you focused or help you research. 

I finished my output just in time for submission, and if my research and personal experience has taught me anything it's that people with ADHD need a good support system. Change up your patterns, find time to give your eyes a break, schedule study groups. There are more ways to help you other than medication, if you feel that's not working for you. 

Best of luck!"
