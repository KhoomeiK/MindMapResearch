ptsd,fptr0j3,t1_fpscc0b,1588896520.0,I definitely relate with the “get over it” mentality
ptsd,fprrjq2,t3_gewr1k,1588860641.0,"Sometimes I think I’m denial so i can continue the chaos,  before there was label, I just went through life destroying everything and anything, I fear the diagnosis. Once there’s a label for what’s wrong , there’s a starting point to begin “fixing” shit. I’m scared to get better."
ptsd,fprqn92,t1_fprahqo,1588860125.0,"“Love” is tricky. There will always be someone that loves you back, but when that happens, it’s hard work to maintain. I was married for ten years. The love of my life, she knew everything about me and was always trying to help but the help became one sided, I stopped  helping myself and our marriage fell apart. (Un)fortunately. These days I don’t surround myself with many humans so there’s no need to explain myself, just my dogs. And they don’t need to know what’s wrong with me. They just need love and basic needs. They never judge me and if they’re upset with me, it’s an easy fix, more love! (Or toys or food or a walk). Regardless of all that , the denial and self criticism of the PTSD diagnosis is a fuckin struggle, some days you know you’re mess and you need help, others,you’re convinced it’s a lie and it’s all bullshit. Currently i don’t have a cure for this  . But I can say that it’s nice to know that I am not the only one that has these severely conflicted thoughts toward myself"

adultsurvivors,fpqfc6s,t3_gem8za,1588821517.0,"For most of my teenage/adult life I struggled with the “truth”, facts surrounding my childhood were so distorted by my parents. It took me 20 years to finally say fuck you this is what happened and this is how I feel, even after I said something, the truth was just swept under the rug, that really left me fucked and confused. I started to question myself and my own mind. I’ve never used term “validate” to explain how I felt, but since I read your post, that’s exactly what I’ve been looking for, validation that I’m not just fucking crazy and filled with false memories. These things have happened to us and left serious damage, most people can’t even comprehend what has happened, the world is a fucked up place, and not just the world, but the people in it as well. Good day. You are valid"
ptsd,fpqcum0,t1_fpqaycb,1588819956.0,"I’m still struggling with the blame and fault aspects. It fluctuates. Blaming myself, blaming my family, the world, teachers, police. And Other times, I feel like everything makes sense and that I’m making progress, other other times, I’m so fucking disassociated that none of it even matters and I’m just wandering this world, alone and aimless , but the “desolation” brings a certain sense of calm and comfort.

ptsd,fpqbw7i,t1_fpq32q1,1588819370.0,"When I’m falling apart, it all makes sense, all the symptoms and relatable experiences, I seek help and guidance, then I’ll start getting “better” and write it off, like, wow that was kinda weird, as if it was a crazy night of drinking or just an “off” week. I’m constantly battling myself in this manner. Mind games. Believing that I was only pretending . I’m having trouble properly explaining this. I’m just really having trouble coping with this on a constant basis, fractured into several different parts of myself , all with different opinions and views and (self)advice and separate (perceived)realities. Waking up as a different person on a regular basis. I’ve lost touch with what I was originally feeling when I started writing this...."

CPTSD,fpmrrnk,t1_fpmolns,1588740005.0,"Agreed, I had been diagnosed over the years with a full spectrum of mental health issues. It was until I started seeing my current therapist that PTSD was even brought up and since then, she’s been really helpful. Educating and helping me process/cope with the pain that resides inside of me"
CPTSD,fpmqqsc,t1_fpm46g6,1588739269.0,"I’ve also done ifs sessions, similar to a guided meditation. my therapist tells me that everything is okay and it’s a healing process, but every time I come out of it I’m shook and feel like i came to on a different planet. I expressed this to her and we took a break. Its like seeing ghosts, only they’re inside of my head. It would take me days to shake the feeling."
ptsd,fpmpu4m,t3_ge3p67,1588738623.0,"I lived my life in denial for years. Spending time around my abuser as if nothing had ever happened. I was convinced that no one would believe me if I spoke up about what happened. These mind games that I played with myself started to create cracks in my psyche, I was scared to tear my family apart with the truth. When I finally snapped, it all came out and for years I was filled with hate and violent thoughts towards my family. Parents . Siblings, extended family, everyone, naturally when I spoke up, my immediate family didn’t believe and they figured that I was having some mental health episode, this made my rage grow stronger. My parents that failed to protect, my sibling that was my abuser and everyone that heard about it and pretended that i was just having “a moment”. It took me years to
Work my way through this. To cope with the hate I had burning inside of me. Inner peace is possible. But learning to love yourself is the most difficult first step to healing."

kratom,film9o0,t1_fikrr6k,1582504928.0,"I really wish i would’ve seen this before I started, what began as an alternative to lortabs after a gnarly injury became daily use to avoid withdrawals. I had convinced myself that it was no big deal and that I wasn’t addicted, but having been addicted to both drugs and alcohol, I can honestly say, mentally (and physically to a degree) it has become an all too familiar cycle of use. I agree 100% with he information you’ve provided, and for those of you considering this option, educate yourself and then educate yourself some more."

SuicideWatch,fihsu08,t3_f7vxi2,1582413776.0,"Years back I did this, I had my reasons, no relationship, several warrants. And I had just gotten fired. I thought it was a restart. That I finally did it, I took the greyhound and hitched up north then through the Midwest and eventually down to San Diego and Tijuana. Sounds awesome, right? It wasn’t, because I didn’t change myself, I followed me everywhere I went. the depression, the anxiety, the disassociation and suicidal ideations were right there waiting for me at the next stop, I thought I could drink and get high and it would all go away. I found myself in some real dark lows. Causing the same problems, fucking up in all too familiar ways. It’s not always greener my friend, work on you first, then run."
