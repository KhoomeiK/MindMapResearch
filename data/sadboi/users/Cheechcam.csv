HighStrangeness,fqwbx6a,t3_gl322l,1589699039.0,I know you are talking about your own experiences but is there anymore information on that video?
mentalhealth,fq56f2b,t3_ggs39f,1589094023.0,Such a beautiful story. And I’m glad you’re still hear to tell it. It’s a terrible thing that happened to you. I hope you live a long and productive life in defiance of that abuse.
universalaudio,fpy0ndc,t3_gfvgiq,1588993467.0,I have an Apollo Twin x. I’m using Luna (the first proper DAW I’ve ever used) I love them both. The Apollo is expensive but I think it’s worth it.
samharris,fpnhont,t3_gedcv4,1588763237.0,"I like the app. I’ve really enjoyed the David Whyte meditations. I sometimes feel like Sam tries to put too much into a 10 minute (or even 20 minute) meditation session. 

But I owe it to Sam too. The podcast and the Waking Up book have given me a lot.

I prefer eyes closed but I have had some good sittings with eyes open too."
predator,fpm4iza,t3_gdqzhr,1588725404.0,No. Predators is the only one after the first two I’ve liked
predator,fpjoqv8,t3_gdqzhr,1588676288.0,I thought anything that did a crossover with Alain was poorly done. Liked p2 more but predators is entertaining
Danzig,fpic4st,t3_gdn0so,1588637877.0,Nice
universalaudio,fpibhwm,t3_gdlzis,1588637508.0,You need a thunderbolt 3 cable. USB C won’t work. I hope thunderbolt 3 cables are easier to find where you are. It pissed me off that UA didn’t provide one
mentalhealth,fp56vqp,t1_fp4gm5s,1588318363.0,There’s some doctors out there who do more damage than good. It’s horrible you had to experience that first hand
universalaudio,fowam5p,t3_g9wfl3,1588116107.0,It was a big pain for me. They should just include it
industrialmusic,fop89f1,t3_g8fk23,1587955298.0,One of the few games I got into. The score was a perfect foil to the graphics.
Primus,fo1y8p6,t3_g52g42,1587444412.0,I’ve heard him say this before. I guess he said it more than once as that podcast is supposed to feature unaired interviews. Great quote
mentalhealth,fnvakov,t3_g41yrd,1587286087.0,Life on Mars by David Bowie was the first thing I ‘felt’ coming out of anguish and depression. Music really has been so good for my mental health
ThisIsOurMusic,fnn3fi4,t3_g2novs,1587083577.0,Beautiful. I really like the change in bars 18. It ascends beautifully. Not your first composition I’m thinking. Good job!
chicagobulls,fnkxgro,t3_g2d7zy,1587042424.0,G.O.A.T
ThisIsOurMusic,fnkwxii,t3_g2e088,1587042050.0,"I like it. I like the variance in drum patterns you use, especially when the bass drops out and you build it back up again! Keep it up"
mentalhealth,fnkv8au,t3_g2d4ca,1587040828.0,That’s ok. My parents were the same. When things get to real they just back away. Best wishes AriaJung. Drop a line if you feel things getting worse.
mentalhealth,fnkrr6b,t3_g2d4ca,1587038025.0,"It sounds like you’re pretty lonely. Do you have a support network outside of work? Friends, family or a partner. Anyone who you can talk to about your anxiety"
ThisIsOurMusic,fnkqtqc,t3_g28a0v,1587037177.0,Nice and swooshy.
mentalhealth,fnkqodr,t3_g2d4ca,1587037040.0,I’m glad you’re seeing a counsellor. Working any job is hard when you feel like that. Can you tell your boss or the HR department what you’re going through?
Bass,fn2wc6e,t3_fz0a1f,1586605749.0,"Good song, bass line and dictator!"
hellraiser,fn2m1r5,t3_fp0ts5,1586594077.0,First two and I didn’t mind 3. Was surprised (in a good way) by Judgement. I found it simple and punchy.
skeptic,fmvhxgv,t3_fxcbyr,1586417607.0,Anyone putting a microphone in front of stupid is going to get stupid
chicagobulls,fmuwwll,t1_fmue8nz,1586400709.0,I think Atkinson would be a great pick up
mentalhealth,fmkor85,t3_fvv09f,1586162680.0,Persevere and get help. You know you can get yourself out of this tailspin because you have before. You know how you feel now isn’t how you’ll always feel. I feel for you.
ThisIsOurMusic,fmhjkdx,t1_fmhh89v,1586082828.0,Same to you. Please keep sharing!! :)
ThisIsOurMusic,fmhh3l9,t1_fmhgw2a,1586079866.0,A talented one at that
ThisIsOurMusic,fmhgaq7,t3_fv5bnj,1586078927.0,Brilliant! The whole thing. How many people in the band?
mentalhealth,fltoji8,t3_fr3hp9,1585481647.0,"Don’t trivialise other peoples trauma, or try to interpret how it affects them."
mentalhealth,fllv7pg,t3_fplncz,1585268434.0,Yes. It’s why I got off Facebook and worked on getting into my own rhythm
samharris,fllib79,t1_flkjrak,1585260881.0,My favourite too. Glad to hear others acknowledge it
melbournemusic,fllfmqa,t1_flk3u94,1585259414.0,Cheers
melbournemusic,fljk9tb,t3_fjfhbb,1585216225.0,What’s your band called? We’ll be looking for a show when this all clears up
melbournemusic,fljiv53,t3_fjfhbb,1585214472.0,Playing to an empty room would be a powerful statement
melbournemusic,flji0be,t3_fjfhbb,1585213400.0,"Yeah, eventually. You looking to fill a bill?"
mentalhealth,fk6vc0p,t3_fgu8wz,1583917781.0,I stopped using Facebook for the same reason! That was over two years ago and I don’t miss it
synthesizers,fjp7i3j,t3_feka1w,1583543732.0,I’m freaking out
MisterBald,fjiwxh3,t1_fjiscxv,1583377642.0,I think this vid won’t be up long
MentalHealthBuddies,fisalh3,t3_f9ilzk,1582681167.0,Has something happened to start these feelings?
Primus,fimnaj3,t3_f8op9h,1582538291.0,Larry is one of my favourite guitarist. The perfect foil for the colonel
MentalHealthBuddies,fijoji4,t3_f881y3,1582457742.0,That’s terrible. You shouldn’t have to go through that from someone who is there to help.
MentalHealthBuddies,fij0ovi,t3_f7xjir,1582431871.0,Meditation did wonders for me. I do it every day. I’m glad that you have a plan for moving forward.
MentalHealthBuddies,fiix0t7,t3_f7xjir,1582429042.0,You wrote that a few hours ago. Have you considered your next steps? Do you have a school counsellor who you can open up to?
MentalHealthBuddies,fiiwh6o,t3_f7xjir,1582428641.0,Sounds like you’re going through a rough time. Please get help. It won’t always be this way. You will find your people who value you. Being a teenager is hard. It’s a good thing that you reached out here. From your comment you seem like a thoughtful and reflective person. That’s rare
chicagobulls,fi9elqu,t3_f757mu,1582263290.0,If he just focused on shooting and stopped playing above himself he’d be a solid bench player. He makes poor decisions
MentalHealthBuddies,fi27y7s,t3_f5wnxd,1582073551.0,That’s unfortunate. I hope your new workplace is more empathetic. Some times I think you just have to leave for the betterment of your own mental health
MentalHealthBuddies,fi1zzxa,t3_f5wnxd,1582068390.0,"Would you feel comfortable going to HR about these instances? That boss probably isn’t familiar with someone being as emotionally honest as you were being at that time. I guess some people aren’t wired to address that, or as raised to not project their own emotions or acknowledge them in others."
MentalHealthBuddies,fi1v43u,t3_f5wnxd,1582065399.0,It’s really tough. Good on you for processing it in a positive way! I wonder if people would still act that way if they knew how much it effected us
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fhyymep,t3_f5dm1v,1581986805.0,Good for you mate. It isn’t easy. Touch base here and let us know how you’re going if you feel up to it.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fhwsb8l,t3_f5528q,1581927812.0,Good for you!! Glad to hear you persevered and are moving ahead. Keep it up!
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fhqeua5,t3_f43jz6,1581803305.0,"I guess I should have clarified, I was referring to the professionals who work in recovery, not the consumers themselves. I guess they feel threatened by someone doing it their own way. There’s no definitive way to go about recovery. The ‘user manual’ is an ongoing work. Each to their own. As long as you can get there. 
I totally agree on the vegetarian thing too. I followed that path for 8 years. Unfortunately I didn’t do it well and it impacted my mental health. Best wishes with your recovery"
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fhocbo7,t3_f43jz6,1581749730.0,"I find that recovery ‘experts’ try to instill doubt when you recover on your own terms, your own way. Good for you on doing it your way."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fhj6e1w,t1_fhj0ybx,1581638941.0,"I take an antidepressant, I’m always going because of my anxiety. Exercise and diet are key, but mindfulness is the trifecta. I had many an opportunity to ease into meditation but would always be skeptical. It came to the point where I had no choice. It changed my life. I still think of those days, and to some degree I miss them. There is that romantic notion of talking to a stranger, high, while the world is sleeping, and watching another sunrise."
Bass,fh0f31f,t1_fh0dnmy,1581203239.0,I think the Mexican factory does some fantastic work. Awesome bass
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fge3bvt,t3_exxrh1,1580690399.0,I had a three week binge and was bad for a year. I came good. The body can recuperate well if you give it rest
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fg5aq62,t3_ews512,1580522578.0,"I have gone through the same thing. Initially I started off smoking weed in my mid teens and then eventually did anything I could get my hands on. I feel fortunate to not have been exposed to IV drugs because I know I would have fallen hard into that. The drinking came later. I basically had to uproot my whole life and move cities. A fresh start. When I met my current partner things started to improve. It’s amazing what real love can do for you. I started to like myself too. I find the things that help my anxiety and depression symptoms are exercise and meditation. They are essential and woven into my day to day. I’m lucky to work in a job where I help people recover, or go about figure out how to recover from their mental illness. Doing this has been a big deal, it filled the hole I had inside. Good luck on your recovery. Asking for help is a big step!"
bladerunner,feles8q,t3_epodkw,1579220474.0,Vangelis. I personally find Zimmer soundtracks a bit bland
Primus,fe0doee,t3_enbq1p,1578811038.0,Brilliant. I love the raw production style. A Ler showcase.
Primus,fdlq2tq,t3_em13es,1578529790.0,I saw this band in Sydney. So off the wall. I’d love to see les play with this kind of lineup again
Bass,fc16v4d,t3_efhtz3,1577309947.0,Get someone to do a set up on it. I’m sure people on here would do it themselves but if you’re like me and not savvy give it to a professional to do their thing to it. It’s worth it
