You don't lose hair, you don't lose ability to have orgasm. The rash was maybe a rare side effect. You should try and ask your doctor about different medications if this isn't working out. Trying medication is like trying clothes, you need to shuffle before finding perfect pair. 

The changes aren't permanent and you don't get addicted to it. Your doctor gradually lowers doses and weans you off it. My doctor weaned me off a medication after 2 months. Trust me it works. Give it time and trust your doctor. They are trained to sort this issue out."
pune,fhounsg,t1_fhor051,1581774429.0,"Sailing in the same boat. I was prescribed medication and I was way more fucked up than you.

The doctors are way smarter than you think. Trust them and take medication on time. I was a hypochondriac and extremely anxious with high BP at age of 24. I am seeing a neuropsychiatric since October and his medication has helped.

If you have SSRI in your cycle then they work or ask your doctor for change. It takes few weeks for medication to work. It's basically altering chemistry of your brain. It's a steady process, have faith in your doctor. The doctors know what they are doing and wouldn't take a chance if they think you are a danger to yourself. 

Side effects are drowsiness, weight gain and lack of sexual libido (I doubt that you are worrying about it). But benefits outweigh the side effects and withdrawal is easily managed. I'm off a medication within 2 months of trying it."
