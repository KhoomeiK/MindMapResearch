You‚Äôll be receiving a digital file of the piece and not the actual product. These pieces can be inspired by anything (within reason) and I will give you my take on the idea.  Meaning they can be the fae that might live in your flowers, the imaginary friend you had a kid, a dragon, or the energy of a song. Whatever sort of things you want to see in my style, I can do. 

If you can afford more, tip, but I want these to be accessible to everyone. If you‚Äôre interested email me at

relationship_advice,f95bbre,t3_e3wu6k,1575123932.0,"I would let the baby stay with them long term, and have a couple visitations so you can be close. Being a parent is more than being blood, it‚Äôs about being capable of being there 100%. What you‚Äôre going through is awful and hurts, but your baby needs stability. Early childhood development is vital to growing up as a healthy adult. Someone can‚Äôt just ‚Äúchange‚Äù parents and not be harmfully affected by it. I know you love her, I know you want the best for her. What she needs is stability right now. What you can do is make your own life as stable and healthy as you can, so that when she‚Äôs older she can meet you and see you as the truly good person you are. These people obviously actually care about her well being if they would be willing to give her back to you. That shows a level of humility that is really important for a good parent to have. 

I understand why you would want her make. That makes a lot of sense, but this about more than just what you want and feel. This is about the healthy growth of your child. You can still love her and act as a sort of ‚Äúfairy god mother‚Äù. Work on your life instead of taking her in. If you can start a tiny little college fund, it might not be a lot but it is an out let for this want. You still have your own life to lead. One day she‚Äôll be able to join you in this life if that‚Äôs what she wants."
Watercolor,f943y65,t3_e3nzw0,1575076633.0,Best tip on painting grass is get a nice photo of a grassy meadow and look at how the colors actually work. You‚Äôll see that the individual grass blades are rarer to see and it comes out more as bands of color with a couple chunks of obvious blades. The more you practice the easier it‚Äôll be to do what your eyes see. But this piece is good! Keep up the good work
offmychest,f943emo,t3_e3mipq,1575076176.0,"I grew up in an anti vaccination home, please vaccinate your child. I nearly died twice and it put all my classmates in danger. Vaccination is a science, it‚Äôs not something people do lightly it is for the best for your child and the community at large. Pack immunity is a very real thing. At 16 I was taken away (for other reasons) from my anti vaccination mom and got (willingly) eight shots in one day. 

Because of my up bringing any flu I get can easily become bronchitis or phenomena which landed me in the ER earlier this year. Please, I am begging you, vaccinate your kids."

drawing,f93s286,t1_f93r4tg,1575067020.0,"The children's book I made, I made in a month. It was for a school project that was supposed to be one painting and I decided to be ~extra~. While it was far from perfect it taught me a lot of information. 

Figuring out the writing and pacing of the story before you make any final paintings. I did the opposite of that, which led to some pages having way too much text than was comfortable. Spend a good chunk of time figuring out your character designs and personalities. Imagine how a kid would see these characters. Draw them in a way that is easy for a kid to draw as well. A part of pokemon's success was that none of the information is out of the a children's knowledge level.  

If I was too do it again, I would:
1) come up with a rough draft of the written story 
2) Thumbnail sketch the art for those story beat
3) rewrite story (many many times)
4) start making the art work and refine the story beats as you go. 

From there I used InDesign to lay everything out all nice and pretty. There are places where you can print on better quality, I just used my schools printer and some cardstock for the cover. 

SCBWI (society of children's book writers and illustrators) is a great place for information. I got sponsored for a year to be apart of it and it was really great and taught me a lot of things. A great thing about people who write and draw for children's books? They're all real dang friendly. 

If you have more specifics questions feel free to ask. I've been trying to learn a lot about the process as the years go on."

ArtistLounge,f932pj0,t1_f932c9j,1575048370.0,"OH woah those sounds beautiful and intimidating, but in a good way. Yes the event page is a great place to go! It might take a minute to hear back, sometimes those places are really slow. So while you wait for this one, maybe peak around at others in the area and do the same thing. 

If the place wants just your art, you might be able to get a couple of your pieces up. If they are hosting multiple artists you might just get one in since those are quite large. If you are doing prints making a couple smaller scale ones would be a good idea. That way you can sell them for cheaper, which will get more people interested, and have more of them which also draws people in more.  Perfect world plan, one big original as the center piece and then some small prints around it. Then if you meet people interested in the print you can tell them about the original being just as big as your center piece. 

Best of luck with all of this! I truly am really excited for you!!"
ArtistLounge,f931l1w,t3_e3h8p3,1575047537.0,"it depends on the area you are in. For my area it is stores hosting artists they like and acting as a sort of gallery, along with actual galleries. Contact the places that you are interested in doing it with and see if they like your art. It's always up to their taste so there is no way to know they'll accept but it doesn't hurt to try! If you go in person, have a physical portfolio to show that is clear and easy to understand, but also not too many pieces. You don't want to overwhelm someone who might not be in the mood. If you are asking via email have some form of digital portfolio ready to go, whether that's an art account, a website, or something else it'll be good for them to see your art right away. 

Once you've been accepted you can ask them how many pieces they want and what sort of frames they expect. I hope this helps! I've been in a couple art walks, so if you have more questions feel free to ask. I'll do my best to help <3"

Watercolor,f92yckx,t3_e38v98,1575045101.0,"You did a really good job on the quail. The colors and line work are really amazing. One thing is, if you‚Äôre going to do a background do it with more patience. Currently the grass blades (I assume) take away from the truly beautiful quail you did. 

If you want spares blades, use a thinner brush and go slower as you make them. That way the grass will have the same level of detail and control as the quail. 

What you could do now is go in and do a fuller background and add more detailed and stylistic grass blades surrounding the quail. 

Other than the background this piece is really beautiful! I really like the little baby popping out too, certainly warms the heart"

Watercolor,f8weiby,t3_e2jawa,1574889001.0,"Koh-I-Noor watercolor pallets are really great. I have been doing watercolor painting professionally for about four years now, and have only had to these pallets. They are about ten dollars, stack up easy for nice transportation and have really nice color pigment. Great for beginners, you don't have to worry about trashing them, and they will last forever. Literally still have the ones from the first time I used watercolor and there is still paint left. 

Princeton Select brushes are really nice and affordable. You can find nice little packets of them for fairly cheap, I would recommend getting a round, liner, and some kind of bigger brush for covering more area. 

Canson watercolor paper or mixed media paper is really high quality and affordable. I've played with ""fancier"" ones and those are not my favorites. 

[Dickblick.com](https://Dickblick.com) is a good place to buy art supplies, it can be a little overwhelming but they have a wide variety and sell to you wholesale. 

On a basic painting time, figuring out how wet you like your paper and brush is important to be able to make anything. This is something that just comes from practice though, and will be different person to person. Also you can 100% do sketches on the paper and then paint, don't be afraid to plan things out a little. But also know, watercolor might move somewhere you don't want. It uses more intuition that other painting techniques in my opinion. 

It's all about experimentation! This is what I've been using for the past four years and really enjoy. I hope your girlfriend enjoys learning watercolor! Best of luck!!"
