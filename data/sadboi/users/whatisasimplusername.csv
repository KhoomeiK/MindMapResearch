SeriousConversation,fqrp0d6,t3_gkbojp,1589588857.0,"Thanks for asking this. My maternal clock started ticking and woke me up to all kinds of things in the world a little over 5 years ago. I always wanted to become a mother with children but knew I was not close to how I wanted it to be: married and in love, own home, no debts, making money (avg cost to raise one child in the US from 0-18 not including college is 255,000), savings for emergencies.

I practiced abstinence to prevent any pregnancies because I'd heard tales from other women and family. I haven't dated in forever and thought about adopting. However I'm nowhere close to having all those parameters met, and I worry that I won't give my parents grandchildren....especially with the world as it is- both of them are elderly and at risk. 

So I kinda understand your question, but I guess it just depends on what you feel and what you want. I do know that a lot of my high school friends have kids. Some are divorced, some on a third marriage, some single moms, and some happily married. Ice worked with a lot of single moms and asked them about motherhood- of all the women I've spoken with: Not a one has ever regretted their children. They get glowier and happier just talking about them."

mentalhealth,fp0q85k,t1_fp0gwya,1588214527.0,"Work, learning, exercise, yoga, journaling, music, and video games are the activities that keep me grounded and focused. I eat super duper healthy most of the time . I don't drink alcohol or do illicit drugs simply because I prefer feeling better and healthier. I believe food is the first medicine because a lot of synthetic medications are based on the chemistry of foods. Food is prevention or cause. You just have to find my best for you. Sometimes medications can get the body toward where it needs to be. For instance, chamomile and valerian are natural herbs to promote calm. Blueberries are natural muscle relaxers. Garlic is antiviral and antibacterial, as are onions. Maltic acid in apples is a purifying and detoxifying agent for the gallbladder and liver. Caffeine can increase brain activity and constructs vessels. However, if you're having a panic attack or have a deathly illness, no amount of valerian or garlic will save you. That's when medications are necessary. And psychiatrists are really rare nowadays in the US and UK, probably due to liability and extra schooling. Insurance needs to cover mental health for it to be more accessible and affordable. I mention psychiatry because they are the experts at brain chemistry. Everyone's brain is similar yet very different, and a lot of it is trial and error and based on what the psychiatrist has observed. 

As for food, Turkey is a natural antidepressant. Vitamin D and 15 minutes of sunlight a day can help too. 

Not sure where you're from, but I know that about 70% of Americans do not take time to prepare healthy foods instead of cramming a fast food lunch into a full 8 hour workday, and much less figure out what foods have what vitamin or mineral or healing property.

Well in that case you are probably not alone with your struggle.  You might be surprised - they might relate. Have you considered suicide?  Are you having suicidal thoughts?  That's another possibility- calling a national crisis hotline. You can also go to the ER and tell them if you want help. You cannot control how another person feels.  

Love is when you want the other person to only feel the good.  Is that what you are asking? Because it reads like you are feeling like your family's feelings are more important than yours, and that feeling stems from love.  

Yes, my immediate family learned about my GAD when they prescribed Clonopin years ago. One family member said they were bad medication, so I quit. While getting treatment for the GAD and OCD away from home, I came back to visit, and one sister actually stole the Xanax and Cymbalta and hid them. She claimed they were bad for anybody. I decided months later that natural was better and found healthier coping mechanisms. I've never had suicidal thoughts. However, I believe that it takes time to heal anything. Faith is powerful and a healer as well."
mentalhealth,fozz6b2,t3_gaegat,1588199494.0,"1. They might, but they could also be compassionate.
2.  How would you be undermining their struggles? Need more info to answer that.
3. It could, but it could also deepen and strengthen it.

Mental health should not have the stigma it does. Like dental and vision, it is part of the entire body's health, systemic. I have struggled with OCD and GAD since I was 12. Some of it is congenital and learned behaviors from my family members, and some of it was compounded by nature and experiences. I have found healthy coping mechanisms from my family and on my own as well as from asking for help.  By knowing each other's mental health, you can provide support and learn from each other.

For instance, my half aunt and aunt have MDD (funny that that encompasses almost all depression related mental health and is 4 different illnesses) and I did not know until one of them stopped by my house without her medication. She was almost textbook manic, and she knew why. Now I did, and it explained a lot. On the other hand, an ex of mine was paranoid schizophrenic. I did not know this until years after the relationship ended. However, had I known then our communication would have been different and the relationship would not have escalated to violence on his part.

He mentioned eugenics. He mentioned conspiracies. He mentioned vaccines. He wondered why we weren't making ventilators and masks in the US. He said poor people will die more than rich. That happened for 4 days. On the 4th day, his child (his dog) are some meat out of the package - along with the plastic, paper, and styrofoam of the package. He was crying and made a vet appt for the next day. The following day, Sunday, he went to the vet with his pup. I got a call about an hour or two after from our father saying he was taking him to the ER cause his BP was 240/180 and ge'd been saying ""Im dying. I am the coronavirus."" The ER gave him clonidine and toradol and a diuretic for his blood pressure. Instead of sleeping, he called my mom and she went and got him. He paced all night and woke me up repeatedly whispering ""I need to be quarantined.""  He had laid down a couple times but got up every time. He would not rest. That morning my mom suggested he try her bed, he laid in it. He cried and repeated that the world was ending and people were doing nothing. He repeated that he was the coronavirus and he was dying and that his brain was split. My mom asked him if he wanted to go to the ER because they would send him to a facility. He cried and said yes.  He drank a little of a smoothie but had not eaten. He said he was confessing and that ""men are the problem"" because he knew people who watched rape porn. We took him to the ER. Then we transferred him to a facility. My mom said not to talk to him because ""he's talking out of his head. He can't hear you."" That's when I understood more.  I was crying, but I knew that he needed help we could not provide ( xrays scans medications etc). 
He's been there for 2 weeks now, and he said he told them he did all these bad things that weren't true and if he told them the truth now they wouldn't believe him. He asks if he was in an accident. He wasnt, but he took care of my mom and I after we almost died in one. He was at the medflight and recounted it to me "" your face was covered in blood and your lip was trembling. Mom recognized me and said don't worry but I thought she might not make it."" 

He's always been the tough strong one and never put himself first. He got help for the pain pill addiction and was getting ofc the suboxone. He was taking a very low dose. He doesn't make as much money as he wants, and the suboxone is very expensive even with insurance. He had to borrow money to take his dog to the vet, so that probably compounded with the trauma and stress is what happened. He needs to be kinder to himself and realize he is important and worthy. He kept saying "" why should I live and Chinese people and old people die? Just cause of where I was born?"" He talked about AI and the singularity too. "" What is the cost of a life?""

It sounds like the stress and worry over your children and what they were being exposed to overwhelmed you. Something similar caused my mom's chemical imbalance cause her son was in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm and she was raising 3 other children in her own- a 5 and 6 year old and a teenager.

He doesn't drink. He was a pack-2 pack a day cigarette smoker. He had a great routine. He just stopped sleeping. Sleep gets toxins out of the brain. He might have been depressed and hid it, cause he has absolutely no confidence the way he talks. This is the first and only break he's had that I'm aware of.

So you're saying that even with medication and recovery, he could have another at any time? My mother could as well even though she had only 1 about 30 years ago?

careerguidance,flxkwao,t1_flvwp0i,1585584888.0,Doesn't experience carry more weight in IT? Is IT more about certs than degrees or diplomas?
careerguidance,flxkqju,t3_frbgyf,1585584798.0,"33 and I was 100% sure of what I was going to do for a career at 18. At 25, life went in a different direction. While learning that vocation ( becoming a nurse) I learned about computer programming and started learning it through youtube and books in my free time. At 31, life took me out of nursing for a bit, and I learned about other careers while wondering if I should stay in the healthcare field. Something less stressful and requiring typing sounds awesome. I love learning, but I don't know which skill is in demand or what to learn. Plus, experience usually trumps knowledge. I live in a location that is considered ""remote"", and the only 2 employers with more than 500 employees are Wal-Mart and a factory. 

TL, DR - Yup. Every case is different, and life changes. The norm of 1 job for life is not the norm anymore, and a lot depends on location despite online and work at home opportunities."
PlasticSurgery,flryzoz,t1_flrwfex,1585430847.0,I make my self pucker/kiss air for 30 seconds at a time or smile  so that I can't clench my jaw. I dunno if I'm doing it while I sleep. I'm terrified of needles (which is funny cause I'm a nurse) and can't imagine one near my face. I've been googling about botox because it has a lot of medical uses that I was not aware of.....like yours. BTW it is *awesome* to hear about great results from medical procedures instead of negativity ;)

careerguidance,flrk1mw,t1_flrj6uu,1585421808.0,"New Jersey tried to pass a law 1 CNA for every 8 patients a couple years ago. That's still too few CNAs...how about 4 patients for 1 CNA? And 2 per hall at ALL times? Yes, I'm aware that life happens, but you don't want to injure your staff or your patients/residents.  What's the solution?"
careerguidance,flrjokk,t1_flri9de,1585421592.0,"Thank you. I often don't feel like I am. And I'd say that 1/2 the issue with nurses not being able to help is the amount of medications ( including wounds and treatments) for each shift, not to mention blood sugars. And God forbid there is a fall, incident, or extreme vitals.  And goodness, if you only have one lift and someone else is using it *facepalm*  .....how can we make it better for everyone- patients and staff? It does seem to be mostly about money and profits, but for those that care too much and get burn out- it's about taking care of and helping human beings and improving quality of life.  One of the CNAs told me that we would have had a second lift, but the DoN got a bonus by saving money ...instead of spending it on patients.  

I want to be at work, but I live with people over the age of 60. :S I'm staying in and refreshing some knowledge. You take care of yourself too! No such thing as social distancing with transfers ;)  and YOU ARE APPRECIATED even if you never hear a Thank you."

careerguidance,flri6zp,t1_flrhsfp,1585420716.0,"That's disgusting. Had no clue. Was told where I work is lowest paying in area- our CNAs make 9-14 an HR depending on experience. However, a lot quit because a factory opened up that pays roughly the same, so we've been hiring agency for over a year now- including nurses. We still have call-ins and have days where there is only 1 or 2 CNAs for 3 floors :("

careerguidance,flrgkia,t1_flrdxpf,1585419759.0,Wow. The agency only pays CNAs 10 an hour?
careerguidance,flrghl2,t1_flq2jni,1585419711.0,"Not to mention how understaffed most healthcare facilities are. As a nurse, I can speak from experience. Even after finishing a med pass I try to help my CNA or CNAs. They don't get paid enough either."
PlasticSurgery,flqunc1,t3_fqfvxb,1585406606.0,"Wow thanks for sharing! I just learned botox can help with TMJ. I constantly have to remind myself to stop clenching my jaw (started doing it after a broken neck), and it isn't a good thing to do. This might be a solution. I haven't tried jaw exercises yet, and definitely don't need any slimming to my jaw. There are probably a lot of people with severe TMJ that aren't aware of this though! Thank you."

He had finished Malazan ( Iskaral Pust and his wife are hilarious) while I tried Pratchett.  

I love Rothfuss's writing as much as the story, where, you're right not much happens except to tantalize your imagination and anticipation for what happened and what will happen. And then there are the funny moments like the above"

PlasticSurgery,fkp6iyr,t3_fjujm7,1584402913.0,"I guess it is different for each patient, and I've read about people spending 100,000s of dollars looking for the right surgeon. The consult with my surgeon- he answered questions I didn't think to ask. He was super knowledgeable and did not rush at all. After, all I want to do is send people to his practice! He is beyond great, and his nursing staff are too!  I didn't talk to anyone he'd done surgery on before, but I thought his gallery was great. That's what you should do- look at the surgeon's before and after gallery. I still have to write up an excellent review about my experience and results. If you were in the area, I'd recommend him and his practice. Good luck with whatever you decide- just remember it is your body and your choice and you only get one body. Take your time."
