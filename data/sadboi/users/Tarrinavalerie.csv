Soulnexus,fr3vbdu,t3_gidjij,1589867283.0,"Wow. I have been looking for this. This 100% resonates.

I used to want to speak a great husband into existence. I would write down all the qualities my future husband would have. Now I could meet a man who checks off the entire list and I just wouldn't want to be in a relationship. In fact I sort of have. I've reconnected with someone I went to high school with and he is everything I had hoped to manifest. However, I had to explain to him that I am not looking for anything like that anymore in my life (he seems to think he can change my mind and is really trying hard to show me he wants me in his life). 

When I start to entertain the idea of a relationship, I quickly realize it stems from societal pressure mostly. 

Why can't we just experience each other without it always having to be called something? I don't want to be anyone's wife. And, I love more than one person at a time sometimes to be completely honest. I feel whole though."
