You seem like you are quite considerate and open minded on the subject of Autism and ASD. But I feel that 2 points that kinda stick out on this.

1) The choice to disclose one's neurotype, health issues, etc etc is only the choice of the person who is effected by by it themselves. Not anyone else's. Pretend for a moment that this person was autistic. You might have just put them on the spot about something they may not be willing to disclose yet (if at all).

2) Not everyone is as understanding and open on the subject of ASD as you. Many people and aspects of society are still quite uninformed, ignorant, or outright judgemental towards Autism and autistic people. Even merely implying that someone is on the spectrum could subject them to assumption or outright judgement on their character.

Report these actions to the school. As long as you're not being directly confrontational and doing it through the schools proper channels, it should go relatively smoothly.
