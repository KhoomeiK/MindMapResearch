I will speak to what I have experience with, which is coming off of medication and then having a series of tough events and life changes follow. It sent me into a deep depressive/suicidal episode that took months to sort out and led to a lot of therapy. What I did do personally was go back on medication to transition more smoothly. It may not be the right choice for you, but with everything that has happened to you, it would not be unwarranted to go back on the meds until you feel more confident to handle this without. By that, I mean you could go back on the meds as a supplement to getting good quality therapy. 

As for William, it sounds like he may have experienced serotonin syndrome, and his doctor did not take the proper precautions before medicating. Unfortunately, doctors aren't always thinking. I personally use the website drugs.com to check for drug interactions before I take anything new, even if the doctor has assured me it is safe. This may give you peace of mind for the future. 

I don't feel comfortable speaking to some of the other issues you mentioned, but my best advice is to seek the help of an experienced professional who can speak to these issues. It may take time to find a good therapist, but it is worth the hassle 100%. The website Psychology Today is a good place to start."

I personally have not noticed significant weight gain, maybe 3 or 4 lbs, but it's hard to tell if that's from the meds or just general metabolism slowing. 

As for anxiety being worse after getting off, my best advice is to spend your time on the meds looking for a good therapist that you trust. Once you have that, you can start to make a plan for how to manage once you're off the meds. My personal experience was that my anxiety didn't spike or rebound after getting off the meds, but I was in therapy at the time. 

I went back on meds about a year later for personal reasons that were more related to depression that was fueling my anxiety, but I likely would not have done so otherwise. 

If you're super worried, start small. Break the pills in half and do half doses for the first week or two. My PCP recommended this for me. If you don't like it, there's no weaning period because the dose is already so small. And if this med doesn't work out, keep trying.

I don't think they make your tattoo look bad, but if they bother you, definitely talk to your artist about a touch up. See what he has to say about it.

apexlegends,fg6vd04,t1_fg6va3f,1580577743.0,"You literally just said that it's impossible to win late game without one. My whole squad doesn't use the 99 and we've won plenty of games. Therefore, your statement is inaccurate."
apexlegends,fg6v7x8,t3_ex95ly,1580577649.0,I've never used the r-99 and I have over 150 season wins.
recipes,fg55sxw,t3_ewy7za,1580518987.0,"I don't think it will work on induction. However, I have a tagine and I never use it on the stove (I'm afraid to crack it; I have gas). My advice is to preheat it in the oven (coated with oil), do your precooking in a regular pan, and then transfer to the tagine and bake in the oven to finish."
apexlegends,fg4x1ho,t1_fg4whxv,1580513010.0,"None of that info points to Johann as Bloodhound for sure. Bloodhound could be Johann, Brigida, or their child. Johann talking about settling in an office seems to indicate that he lived on Talos before the meltdown occurred, as he makes no reference to the meltdown event."
Baking,fg4wbg7,t3_eww8yy,1580512538.0,"I don't know a ton, but I do know that you have to let them dry out before baking, otherwise they don't develop feet. Seems like that may be part of your problem, as yours seem to be missing their feet and glossy finish. Give it a try on your next batch."

mentalhealth,fg06t6i,t3_ew7nht,1580401469.0,"If you're in the US, look into the GeneSight test. I haven't personally taken it, but I know people it has helped."
ZeroWaste,ffyjjty,t1_ffyfu92,1580347945.0,"Good point about biodegradability, but how many brands are there that make biodegradable or compostable packaging for said condoms? I think they generally have to be sealed individually for health and safety, but I have not come across any brands using sustainable packaging for that. If you know of any, please share."
ZeroWaste,ffyjb2q,t1_ffy9msl,1580347778.0,"I was just answering OP's question. If you don't want condom waste, then what I said is fair. If you prefer condoms, then go for it. I am personally not a fan of them and neither is my partner of 3 years. Whatever works for you is fine. I was just simply stating the situation in which I think it would be okay to forgo condoms if you choose to do so."
ZeroWaste,ffy2whi,t3_evucdw,1580337528.0,"IMO use condoms until you are in a committed monogamous sexual relationship. If you've both been tested and are each others' only partners, then you are probably safe to rely on other forms of birth control. But the safest/most effective forms of birth control often use plastic as well (IUD and implant). The pill can be great, but it is not always effective unless you are good about taking it at the same time everyday (and the packaging is often plastic). 

I personally think that the IUD or implant are preferable in terms of being zero waste as they have the least packaging and last for several years. But with any birth control, it's nearly impossible to be zero waste and fully protected at the same time."
Visiblemending,ffx6f4m,t3_evpwpc,1580318727.0,"I bought this shirt at Goodwill four or five years ago and it has served me well. It developed a small hole near the bottom hemline, so I grabbed my embroidery supplies and fixed it the best I could. 

I usually just do the old needle and thread to close up the hole, but this time I felt like trying a more visible mend. I'm pretty happy with the results. It gives it character."
Visiblemending,ffwqcsb,t1_ffvy63a,1580308442.0,Looking into similar options in the US. Thanks!
