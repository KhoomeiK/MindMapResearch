AskReddit,fqp9iti,t1_fqovqn0,1589539805.0,"We don't actually know that for sure. 

Everyone is on the autism spectrum somewhere. We diagnose those who exist on the further end in which it impairs functioning. We don't diagnose unless it's causing an issue for that person in work, life, and/or relationships. 

It is entirely possible that there has been an increase in the number of people who are on that further end. This could be due to a huge number of environmental factors including diet (what da fuck is in meat and dairy these days, not to mention chemical coloring in food), pesticide use, exposure to chemicals prenatally (air quality, prenatal care, recreational and prescriptive drug use).  

We might just be more likely to diagnose it, but we also might be experiencing an actual increase in the number of people who exist further on the autism spectrum (and other mental health continuums).

Edit. I'm curious why this is being downvoted. It's okay that it is, but wondering why. Genetic modification due to environmental factors is a pretty well established contributing factor in clinical and  neuro-psychology.

Predoctoral students (4th year PhD) are looking for accredited (or equivalent) supervised placements. Look up APPIC accreditation for more information. These will have to be paid full time roles ($40,000ish). 

Supervised practice psychologists have their PhD and are working full time. They will need to be offered a competitive wage ($60,000-80,000 depending on province and role).

Our littles should not be, or feel responsible for our emotional needs as parents. If he comforts you once or twice, in a cute and fun way, wonderful, you have an empathetic little boy on your hands. 

 But be tuned into if this is becoming a pattern. Does this happen repeatedly?  Children shouldn't feel they are responsible for soothing an upset parent. That's a big responsibility for a little person and isn't healthy in the long run. It leads to parentification of the child and breaks down the child's internal script about who should be responsible for who."

AcademicPsychology,fk3lk2l,t1_fk3hjkk,1583838764.0,"Hard to know without actually being an expert in your field and reviewing your paper. 

I might be wrong but I thought a big part of peer review is that experts explore the validity of the argument and the ability to be reproduced by someone using the same method. Because it wasn't systematic, someone using your method would likely come up with a very different conclusion than yours?  

You say that you cherry picked studies that supported your hypothesis. To what degree do you explore alternative or contradictory perspectives? 

Is it possible that the field experts felt that your approach did not result in a valid or replicable result?"

You acknowledged that you and Bob have been lucky and / or the recipients of good connections, and that Alan has a history of working hard, perhaps even harder than you and Bob at times.  Now, if Alan was a lazy turd then this would look different ... But based off of your responses I'd wager that Alan doesn't ACTUALLY want you to get cancer. 

Believe it or not, this is less about you and more about him. He feels alone and isolated in feeling lesser (less successful, less happy, less whatever). He's hurting. And maybe needing a boost or an empathetic ear from a friend right now. This is him telling you he's having a hard time and it sucks.  Sometimes we just need someone else to see that too so we don't feel alone and crazy for thinking that way.  

If you were in Alan's shoes, like really and truly had his upbringing and everything, how would you feel? 

What you could do/say: 

1. Listen, let him purge out the feelings of unfairness. Don't try to fix it. Just listen and say ""yeah, I hear you man"" or try to summarize what he said back to him ""what I think I'm hearing you say is ..."" 

2. Validate  ""yeah your right - it's not really fair. I'd feel similarly if we were in opposite situations"" 

3. Bolster -  ""What I appreciate about you is ... You work your ass off for .... and are a really great.... remember that one time you .... (Insert things you truly value and notice about him - don't blow hot air up his ass but be genuine. There's a reason this guy is your friend.)

Psychoeducational testing or speach and language assessments are the easiest and most accurate way to identify the processing deficits. 

Do you have access to WIAT-III s at your school? You want to look at scores on all the reading subtests and run the error analysis program on the results. 

Can also try observing the issues but this takes a well trained eye
- can they comprehend material well if it is read to them vs having to read it themselves 
- does the student have a hard time sounding out new words but can recognize familiar ones quite well 
- can they sound out pseudo words? 
- if given a long list of letters and numbers, compared to other kids, how much do they stumble on quickly and fluently identifying them out loud 
- when they spell new words, are they spelled incorrectly but phonetically right? Or are they waaaaaay off

mentalhealth,fjp358t,t3_fa66hr,1583540691.0,"Fist label what it as a panic atrack. You are not dying but your body is reacting to perceived stress and threat.  Admit that to yourself and prepare to counter the panic with opposite mode. Do the opposite of what the panic wants you to do. 

You can work with any of the three components. 

- Thoughts:  recite to yourself 5 things you are grateful for, 4 things you enjoy (or might enjoy) doing, 3 people or animals who care about you, two things you are looking forward to, and one positive thing about yourself 

- Sensations: get out of your head and into your body. Ground yourself with 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can touch, 2 things you can smell, one thing you can taste. 

- Movement or action: slow down, walk around at the pace of a snail taking the slowest and most intentional steps you can, focus on how sturdy the ground is behind you. Panic thoughts come back in? Acknowledge those thoughts and then bring your awareness it back to the feeling of walking.  Or do something slow and rhythmic - slow beats on a drum. 

- bonus trick to try, some research suggests that focusing on something very close to your face (4 to 6 inches away) for a few seconds, then focus on something very far away for a few seconds. Rinse and repeat while taking slow and intentional breaths. Notice the small eye muscles that relax and contract as you shift your focus. This doesn't work for everyone.

Lastly, learn your early warning signs so you can intervene before the attack escelates."

Phonological awareness 
Phonological memory
Working memory 
Rapid naming skills - specifically letters 
Processing speed 

The processing deficit will tell you how to remediate best for the kid question.  This is why some reading programs work great for some kids and crap for others."
