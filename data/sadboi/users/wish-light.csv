depression,fbyjo5u,t3_ef4960,1577218597.0,"I understand you.. you can't always control how you feel. Sometimes you feel a little lost in life and with Christmas you might realise what's missing even more. 

My only advice is to still try to appreciate what you have.. I'm a single child as well. My dad is in the hospital this Christmas eve, it's probably his last Christmas as well. Not quite the ideal Christmas either, this whole situation has really put things in perspective for me though. 

Merry Christmas to you, and also to anyone who might read this. I hope you will be able to enjoy it at least a little bit."

tumblr,f8s0dgo,t3_e1lltf,1574762583.0,"Last year when I was in therapy I decided I want to try medication, so I made an appointment with the psychiatrist. If only I knew what a boomer witch she was. 

When I was in the waiting room and she walked up to call me, she immediately commented on my coat. It was moderately warm outside so apparently it wasn't acceptable to wear one. 

Once I was in her office she asked me if I had ""something on"". I didn't understand so I said no. It turned out she meant if I wore makeup on my face to make me look more pale. My God, yes I wear makeup but my ghostly white skin is all natural thank you very much, and I even wore a lot of bronzer that day. 

Needless to say, I did not go back to that psychiatrist."

I also think that people who frequently watch your content will understand the thumbnails are ironic. Don't let those negative people get to you!"
