Edit: Your control is absolutely amazing. Maybe look into trying a little ballet. It's annoying but very fundamental in dance. It teaches you how to carry and move your body through space in the safest way. It may also help to create a new dimension in your kinesphere. 
Also, look up other hip hop dancers (fik-shun, Bdash and Konkrete,  Jabbawockeez, Poppin John just to name some I know) and find inspiration in their craft. Give yourself the creative push and let your body do the art."
