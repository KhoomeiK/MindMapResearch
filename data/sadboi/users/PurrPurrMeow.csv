Anxiety,fkl2ene,t1_fkkxhjr,1584297014.0,"We have a store at the mall where we can get it and its local so it has Florida in the title but its 750mg which seems to work pretty well for me. I know your weight matters for the dose and I'm about 200lbs and one drop in my normal vape juice lasts me all day. Its pretty expensive but its important to spend the money for quality. It cost $60 but that's actually a good price. You're going to wait a higher dose if you weigh more and a smaller dose if you weigh less. You can always add more if needed, sometimes if I cant sleep I use two drops and it helps but I'd recommend not even spending the money on the 50mg because you'll probably go through it pretty quick. The bottle is kinda small but I think itll last me close to the end of the year. I haven't tried it but I found some online that has pretty good ratings called CBDfx.
Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just excited because I didnt expect it to work but I really recommend it. Of course it doesnt work for everyone and it might take a few days to notice the effects.
Last note: it counteracts with some medications so I'd check that too before you buy!"
