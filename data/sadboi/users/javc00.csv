SuicideWatch,fr45jke,t3_gma8gz,1589876550.0,Don't think there is one you just cease to exist and that's about it. No peace nothing just abrupt stop to all this suffering and I'm here for it.
NoStupidQuestions,fr0esli,t3_glwbh2,1589793055.0,Yep same. Actually started keeping a 'messy' notebook aside from the other one (like some people have suggested already) but whenever I write something worthy in that one it turns into the new 'fancy' one so I start another one and it's and endless cycle only stopped by me ripping the pages out.
ftm,fqxcvnz,t3_gky9e9,1589730129.0,Yep this is definitely an issue for trans guys. Some get insomnia and others just sleep too much. I for once dangle between both with me being more tired when I’m close to my next shot
ftm,fqwlbyf,t1_fqvwc8e,1589708683.0,Same experience here. My mum actually admitted to me that she was upset when she found out my brother was a boy but learned to make the *best out of the situation.* As someone who's had a very toxic enviroment because of my dad and brother both my sister and mum *dislike* men. My sister even told me she didn't want to call me a he because right now she associated those pronouns to a really hostile enviroment and just avoids using pronouns with me at all costs.
ftm,fqwktz5,t1_fqwj6l8,1589708142.0,Same. It just seems to me that they want to attract attention on the fact that although they just misgendered you they are correcting themselves because they're #woke. When I first started transitioning I'd much rather have my friends quickly change the she to a he and me just act like I didn't hear it the first time around than have them make a show about it. It's an uncomfortable situation and like all uncomfortable moments one wants to move quickly passed it and just act like it never happened.
ftm,fqwklx8,t1_fqw7a1t,1589707897.0,Honestly maybe it's just me but having someone knowingly tell me what I want to hear is not as rewarding as just having it happen. It's kind of like forcing an I love you. I'd much rather have the person tell me out of the blue because they *actually* mean it than just feel the need to say it as an automatic response.
ftm,fqvr7ay,t1_fqvqvnv,1589683354.0,I agree with absolutely everything you just said if I had coins I'd give you an award.
ftm,fqvocay,t1_fqvnuug,1589681549.0,I can definitely relate to that whole relationship dynamic. My best friendships are based around the constant 'insults' and mockings of each other yet whilst still respecting the other and never treespassing the *personal critiques*
ftm,fqvni9t,t1_fqvn5qc,1589681027.0,They really do think they're doing *something*
ftm,fqvneux,t1_fqvmlx5,1589680966.0,Yeah my hatred for it could most definitely be derived from my need for people to just cut the crap and be real in all situations like you.
ftm,fqvnaxb,t1_fqvlvjp,1589680900.0,"I normally do see it amongst the younger generations and it's that which annoys me. I honestly don't care so much for the older one for they are just trying to be accepting (as you said). Their comments just remind me of the ""you've grown up to be so handsome"" to cis people so I know it's just their version of that phrase."
SuicideWatch,fqvkmwr,t3_gksxyu,1589679306.0,Not trying to sound mean or anything but why is this even a discussion?
ftm,fqvhthu,t1_fqtntvw,1589677571.0,">Women will be like ""kill all men"" but then be like ""trans men are okay""

Was just going to comment about this. Honestly I couldn't care less about that saying just add me to it if it's said. I am a man so if you hate men you hate me ok lol.

It gives me the same vibes as lesbians who claim they like women and 'trans-men' only. I even had one tell me she was bisexual for me but just didn't like dicks -.-

Also the whole smol bean thing makes me really  uncomfortable. Whenever I talk about me doing 'guy' things like ""yeah I was just shaving"" I get awh or that cute eyes emoji which just makes me uncomfortable cause you would never say that to your cis male friends so...?"
reactionpics,fqr2fa4,t3_git6sw,1589576328.0,Worse than read
SuicideWatch,fqqu0yc,t3_gk7spi,1589571943.0,"The accuracy of this is unreal. The lack of information I've found online has just lead to me failing at completing the job and thus wasting my parents' money on more treatment and the growth of rejective feelings towards me.

I still want to do it I'm just scared of ending up failing once again yet this time not being as 'lucky' and ending up in a vegetative state and therefore stuck in this world.

Honestly it haunts me how me staying alive is just causing more and more damage in my family and how me having have ended my life back when I first tried would have saved numerous aftermath results. Narcicistically it would also have been an 'admirable' death as I was a model son back then.

Honestly at this point people are just surprised I'm not dead already."
musictheory,fqqijtv,t3_gk7gvp,1589566129.0,"Looks great. I subscribed. Am always lookng for new channels like this, thanks for spreading the word!"
AskPhysics,fqq6sr3,t1_fqq13u8,1589560376.0,"Thanks for the recommendations! I'll most likely just look at the indexes and look for each topic idividually whilst diving deeper into those that most stand out to me.

Do you have any recs on approachable mathematics from a Physics point of view? Maybe to go along with these books or the subject itself."
AskPhysics,fqq5zb9,t1_fqq35ci,1589559977.0,"Right, I've always been told a mathly physical degree would be some kinda engineering guess I've just been misinformed...

As much as I like all those aspects of theoritical physics I'm reluctant to go down that root given it's abstracity in its advanced stages. I'm someone that really likes the tangible aspect of physics and I fee like that's more or less 'lost' down that root. I love reading about new theories but having to work on something that could be unproven at any moment scares me. 

Anyhow, I'll still look into it all, thanks for your help!"
AskPhysics,fqq0pjy,t1_fqpxy68,1589557395.0,What do you mean? As for the second question I'm thinking about mechanical engineering since I really like the mathematical aspect of Physics.
AskPhysics,fqpxp5u,t1_fqpvvu5,1589555872.0,Just looked it up it pretty much has everything I've covered already
ftm,fqo6em5,t1_fqnv858,1589508513.0,"I don’t really get how it works tbh they’ve only just set this law in 2019. Nevertheless you have to see a doctor twice and get asked general questions about your childhood and blablabla (they’re really stereotypical). Yet they do focus and lay out dysphoria and it’s variables to further acknowledge your case.

Honestly they just need enough info to add it to your file for data analysis. They don’t really care about the rest and just send you on your way... 

I don’t think either way is ok. It’s a thing that varies from situation on to situation. I for once had to go through the whole psych evaluation for a year and am kind glad I did. It wasn’t so much as to ‘decide’ whether I was trans or not. They just mainly explored whether I had gender dysphoria or was confusing other feelings for such.

I feel like psych evaluation should just be an exploration of the patient. No it’s not ok to force people into illegal testosterone contraband but at the same time you shouldn’t give out T like it’s cough medicine. I kinda went off on a tangent there but yeah formally they do have to say you have gender dysphoria and actually still get a signed diagnosis in order to change your sex."
ftm,fqnqg82,t1_fqn4tu4,1589499507.0,"I completely agree with that point of view in some cases. Yet in my one, as a Spanish citizen with free healthcare it has benefited me in many ways. Thanks to this diagnosis I have been able to start HRT for 66 cents a shot plus get a follow-up and all. It is also possible to have free top surgery after two years on hormones. This is something that became available once dysphoria was accepted as a mental condition. They've actually just recently taken the obligatory psychological and psychiatric evaluation (unless suffering from other mental illnesses) yet the diagnosis of dysphoria is still assigned and necessary even if as a simple tag-along.

Thus I think the removal of such would take away free healthcare and medical insurance for many people."
ftm,fqnbueo,t1_fqnbbob,1589492099.0,Yeah but I just don't get how you can get euphoria without having dysphoria. Like surely if you're feeling the first you must unknowingly be going through the second right?
ftm,fqnbjkj,t1_fqnateb,1589491948.0,Oh yeah can definitely relate if it happens before to everyone it's going on x 10 for us now.
psychopath,fqn5w7l,t3_gjmjps,1589489204.0,It's gratifying to feel such peace and curiosity for a post.
ftm,fqn4v7z,t3_gjt73a,1589488709.0,What do you mean?
ftm,fqn3qwq,t1_fqn1rui,1589488166.0,"I mean I don't agree with you in the whole society thing and I never actually stated whether I believe these people exist or not.  But disregarding and leaving personal opinions aside, I just wanted to see what other people thought.

I feel like whenever this topic is brought up both sides stick to attacking each other instead of paving the way for a benefitial debate. I personally find all that to be pure internet shenanigans. I just want to further expand my knowledge so I can get to understand people better. Also, as a member of this community and the lack of knowledge people have about it, I am 'doomed' to be answering questions about it for the rest of my life. Guess I'd rather collect different opinions than implantate a biased view of my personal experience for them to cling on to."
ftm,fqmxmp7,t1_fqmso4p,1589485236.0,Yeah I mean I feel like this whole debate has kinda built an iron wall between these two sides. Some make it seem like it's all black and white with one claiming to be 100% dysphoric and the other 0%. Honestly dysphoria as well as transition is an individual thing that varies from person to person. I'm sorry for the fact you had to go through that.
ftm,fqmwur4,t1_fqmsn41,1589484861.0,"I mean not really as you said but at the same time it has affected the way others perceive my transition. I feel like it's made a hit on the whole ""you'll regret this"" philosophy. Honestly I just wanted to talk about this calmly on here since whenever I seem to bring it out amongst other trans peers they instantly get defensive about it. I'm really just looking for a common ground here for I don't know any of you and won't invadilate your situations in any way."
ftm,fqmw3if,t1_fqmshze,1589484501.0,I was honestly reluctant to post this at first because of that and I must say I'm surprised at how well it's going. Guess people on here are a bit more mature than those in other social sites lol.
ftm,fq6eqq6,t3_gh3n24,1589130101.0,Eh it depends. I have an older sister and brother and she's taking it much better than him. Then again my dad is extremely transphobic (I've actually cut off all connections with him since January). My parents are divorced and my brother does a half-a-month stay with each.  This is noticeable in his attitude towards me. My dad's comments and hatred towards me has definitely taken a toll in his opinion. He used to be indifferent about it and now he verbally attacks me whenever we see each other. But eh it is kinda subjective and it depends on whether your brothers have some more emotional intelligence than mine.
SuicideWatch,fq440i1,t1_fq2mrmy,1589073375.0,Not to be rude or anything but he was just asking a valid question
SuicideWatch,fq2hw8t,t3_ggmnac,1589056288.0,You came to find a reason not to. Thus you don't want to actually die.
SuicideWatch,fq1e9fi,t1_fq1brlq,1589044863.0,My plan was always to just study in the UK and hopefully move on from there forwards. But that all went downhill when I was forced to drop out of high school.  I'm now getting my diploma since they're now basing a-level results on school work but I'll be getting C grades thus uni won't be an option. I can't really move away since I have no money so I'm stuck but thanks.
