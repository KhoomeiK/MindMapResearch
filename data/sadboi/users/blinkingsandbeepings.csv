Going through the hassle of reading someone's resume, calling them, interviewing them etc only for them to turn down the job is a huge waste of time and resources. They would much rather have someone who really wants the job.

Kind of funny/weird, but when I first joined the sub I didn’t know what COMP stood for and the best guess I could think of was that it was a warning for “comparison,” i.e. that looking at other people’s’ practices might trigger a need to compare yourself to them.
