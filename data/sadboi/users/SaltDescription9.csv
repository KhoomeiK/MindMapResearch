Heard from a small coffee shop owner that apparently in a couple days (start of April) scomo is going to up the anti on closing down businesses may effect construction and if that happens prepare to see alot more fuckery then you could imagine."

I still try to find something, it sucks though it even takes time doing something just to enjoy it recently I tried just trying to eat less fast food, fishing, going for runs and even fucking dance lessons. They're all still shit but over time they get a little less shitter. Also I found trying to be aware of my own negativity to trying new things can make me give up on them almost even before I started them and not to beat myself up further because then it just solidifies this thought process instead I try to calm my thoughts, accept them and let them pass. Basically it takes work to even like something. This is what's working for me at the moment and may not work you dude but I hope this helps man and wish you luck

Also there is a less convenientional/inconvenient method: shocking events (the only time in your life you will be able to commit to a drastic change for better or worse):
-near death experiences (don't actually attempt this) or big events in your life (people dying, shocking sights)

Temporary shock:a more realistic less effective way which only puts you in to more of fight/flight is cold showers and then if that's not enough ice baths I generally find after that it's hard not to be motivated to move around because it's fucking cold. Then you could use the momentum from that start the day or even try something new
Also fear facing works well and has a long term effect of being able to doing something you never could

Basically everything is boring and shit and once you become aware of it it's not that easy to forget it. It takes time to get out of it, it's a crawl and it's hard to see yourself making progress when your in it I find a journal can be really helpful to look back on when things start getting tough because you can see progress even when you think yourmaking none. Just starts with baby steps

Lastly a physcologist can help just for support and to give another opinion on things and more importantly they can help you figure out who you are and what you want to achieve"
