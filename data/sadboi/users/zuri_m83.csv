What helps me to an extent is keeping busy. For example I will clean and instead of thinking about it I‚Äôll just sing so fucking loud along to the music. At night I just read til my eyes and brain can‚Äôt any longer. This is personal, but I talk to God bc I for some reason can‚Äôt accept He doesn‚Äôt exist, maybe bc I don‚Äôt want to. That more than anything helps me. 

I don‚Äôt talk to anyone about this bc I don‚Äôt wanna trigger such bullshit for whoever I could tell, I would hate for anyone I love to go through this if they haven‚Äôt already. This crap makes me wanna curl up into a ball and sink into oblivion bc the fear is more than I can handle.
