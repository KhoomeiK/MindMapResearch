MLBTheShow,fq2jxij,t1_fq2g9b0,1589056852.0,"2 parts to this

1. According to a couple of MLB The Show YouTubers, it usually goes off a rolling 3 year cycle of performance, slightly weighted towards current day than the past 2, for live series. For single year flashbacks it's basically based on their stats from that year alone, but they will sometimes shift it around to change up cards. Prime and signature cards are based on peak performance.

2. If Bobby Higginson ever got a 95+ card from SDS I would give up the game entirely. He was arguably my favorite hitter as a kid, but he only had 2 good seasons (1996 and 2000) where he was a top 20 hitter in the league and his fielding was never great. Elite arm, I'll give him that, but he was never on that kind of level in the batter's box to warrant anything that high. That's why I used him as an example; at his peak he couldn't ever be considered that kind of Prime/Signature guy."

Flaming people itself makes them feel unwanted, which comes back to our original point. Everyone has a cap and for some people it's bronze. Some it's silver, gold, plat, whatever. It doesn't mean they shouldn't be welcome to play ranked.

The hard part is knowing what that cap is. I'm a 28 year old adult with a full time job and a hobby that I hope to make my profession. I don't have time to play, so I know my cap would be lower. I wouldn't be surprised if my cap now was low silver. It's not that I'm purposefully screwing a game or something. Most players in that position don't know their cap won't admit that they aren't secretly Challenger tier. Even that's okay, imo. Flaming doesn't fix any of it."

Another big one for XP is playing showdown and completing the Create A Player moments. It'll help a lot, although showdown is strange and difficult for a seasoned vet in the game.

You can also go to the collections area to collect full teams of cards and then get more XP/stubs to put towards other things. Some cards are expensive (Trout, Cole, Arenado, Bellinger, Verlander, etc...) But some entire teams only cost like 2-3K stubs. You can collect those, get stubs back for collecting them, and just get a ton of XP.

The XP reward path, to kinda tie both points together, is a blessing. That's where you get free shit just for gaining XP in game. Cards, stubs, icons, etc..."
baseball,fo0bkbs,t1_fnzemvt,1587409739.0,"It's definitely a lot to take in at once, hopefully this helps.

Your bread and butter are gonna be conquest and moments. Look for those. 

Conquest are shortened, 3 inning games where you sim most of the time and play to steal fans (do it to get the achievement at least) and to take strongholds. Easiest way is to take the large area north of Colorado, beef up your line on your east side (between Twins and Cubs) and to your South (Royals). Slowly take over the west side (Colorado, Seattle, Oakland/SF, etc... In that order) then sweep down and get the south west, south, south east, etc... Like you're going counter clockwise with it.

Moments are scenarios only, with stubs and cards for completing them. Most of them are player's career highlights in a shortened, player locked form. Remember when Pudge caught Kenny Rogers perfect game? There's a moment for that. When Eckersley got 4 saves in 4 games in the ALCS? Moment for that too.

There's plenty of other things to do too, which is why it's the only sports game where I play the card game modes, and at no point do I HAVE to play online to get anything. I can do it entirely free to play and entirely offline. There's just extra incentive to do so if you want to play ranked seasons (best of your best vs someone) or battle royale (draft mode)."

It's a small mechanical change but it could make a difference."
PitchingCoach,fnfo6i6,t3_g1ae17,1586911992.0,"Just to expand on my point, the reason you would do this is to increase hip-to-shoulder separation.

Treat it like a rubber band. Stretch it as much as you can within your delivery to increase your velocity. If you stretch it too much, it snaps or flicks off wild. Right now you're at, what I would say, is pretty minimal hip-to-shoulder separation.

Can you send a video of a side angle, preferably in slow motion?"
PitchingCoach,fnep2sj,t3_g1ae17,1586893323.0,"You could test yourself with more contralateral tilt or twist yourself (ie be more horizontal in your delivery) but I don't know if it's worth messing with the form you've built.

Advice,fjvuy55,t3_fevlf5,1583631396.0,"I've told this on Reddit a few times before, but my advice comes from a ouTube video I watched to help with my self esteem issues. ""To have self esteem, you have to do esteem-able things."" If I want to feel good about myself, I need to do things that make me feel good.

Sometimes, it might be that simple. If you want to feel less lonely and have more friends, I would recommend being super friendly to the people around you and make it a point to spend time with others (not your boyfriend).

For advice on how to do this, that's a bit harder. Idk what your day to day is, but it might start with working somewhere and talking to new people there. Working retail, as stressful as it is, helped me a lot because it helped take away the ""imposter"" feeling or intruder feeling you described. I was an employee, just like everyone else there, so we made it work.

Back to the confidence thing, if you want to feel confident in yourself, I would focus on making sure you have things to take pride in. Maybe it goes back to the work piece (if you're competitive), maybe it's a feature about yourself, or maybe it's a fundamental thing where you build your confidence off something you can hang your hat on."

DetroitRedWings,fifw3t4,t3_f7uiq5,1582393825.0,"The lip service thing is an industry issue. Very few players in hockey actually speak their minds to the media. Even fewer coaches would consider it. I mean Christ sake, Hronek took a slapshot to the helmet and he's listed as day-to-day with an ""upper body injury.""

As far as development, yes he has helped to develop players. Larkin went from top 6 C to legit #1 C. Mantha has had issues staying healthy, but there's a clear dichotomy from when he started as a streaky scorer who barely played defense to being sufficient in his own end and a legitimate 30 goal threat. Bertuzzi and Hronek have impressed as well. The only ones where I can see the argument against his development style is with AA and Cholowski, both of whom struggle in the defensive end. Even then, I feel Cholowski was burned when we forced him to go from college to the WHL, but that's an argument for another day.

I legitimately don't see a single coach in the history of the league taking this roster anywhere outside the bottom 5 of the NHL. We have an AHL defense and enough man games lost to injury to cripple any team, let alone one that's already struggling to win.

I think the hardest thing he's got to do, and it seems to be pretty consistent, is making sure the players know how to play ""the right way."" Yes we see defensive lapses, but it's rare to see a guy all alone with a clear shot on net. When it does, it's a blatant mistake from one of the younger guys who got burned. You can teach positioning and schemes all day, but if the players aren't talented enough, that's a separate issue.

All that said, he's not entirely without blame. The entire roster is absolutely fucking stubborn and that's been an issue since Babcock was here. I swear to God if I watch one more fucking drop pass from a defenseman to a forward coming with speed thru the neutral zone, I'm going to lose my mind. That's the only trick we have for zone entries and it's a fucking problem. There's no team in the league that should fall for that shit by now and the ones who do should be embarrassed. We don't win any puck battles (which is why our FO keeps drafting big players like Rasmussen and the Space Jam Monstars Defense from 2019) because outside of Glenny and Bert, no one wants to play in the corners which is required for a dump and Chase offense.

Mr I went over Dombrowski to bring in Victor Martinez (his favorite player) on a big deal despite already having Fielder and Cabrera on the roster. Our defense faltered a bit and our bullpen wasn't good enough to hold games.

We were a team that needed to rebuild after the 2014 season, but didn't. 2015 we're bad and Dombrowski tries to force a rebuild by trading Price, then gets canned for seeing it correctly. 2016 we bounce back and suddenly the team wants to win again because Illitch has that desire for a ring before his time is up. Then we suck in 17 and decide to blow it up.

We paid KRod and Mike Pelfrey something in the region of 10M to NOT play for us. They still have Prince Fielder on the books because of the trade with Texas and turns out he has a degenerative neck issue that cut his career short too.

We made a lot of conservative decisions that, in hindsight, make Avila look incompetent. Yes he should have traded Fulmer for Bregman or Baez, but he had no idea his health would be an issue when he looked like a fersure ace. He didn't get anything for Maybin, Upton, or JD Martinez, but they had minimal value. All the pieces for Verlander have been injured or middling at best. Now he's holding onto Boyd because he's showing signs of significant development, but it's likely the team needs a clean slate on our building blocks.

In recent years, we have stacked up on pitching prospects. Manning, Skabal or whatever his name is, and Mize all look legit, even if Mize ends up as a closer to keep his innings down. Faedo is trying to earn his way back to that future starter status. On the field we don't have much outside of our recent pick Greene. Rogers could be good if he takes his time in AAA and learns to hit breaking balls, his defense is already MLB level. Cameron, Candelario, and Clemens all seem like options for the future, but they have had Rocky starts to their Tiger organizational start."

DetroitRedWings,fgqr2gv,t1_fgqkgi2,1581029678.0,"While you're not wrong, can you honestly see them re-signing him as an RFA to a minor league deal or re-signing him to an NHL deal with the bottom 9 depth we have? Between Fabbri, Zadina, AA, Glenny, Helm, Abby, Smith, Ehn, Nielsen, Filps, and the possible GR call ups of Rasmussen, Svech, and Turgeon, there's not really viable room for Perlini or Erne next season. That's before considering us going out and getting a 1 year FA to trade as a rental for picks. It's just hard to see him earning a spot if he hasn't already."
DetroitRedWings,fgqi6l3,t1_fgq9xp4,1581024655.0,"There isn't a plan for him. He hasn't played well in the few top 6 minutes he's had and been useless as a bottom 6 on a terrible team. We made a low risk, high reward trade and lost. He either gets traded or is released at the end of the year outright."

DallasStars,fg8a41t,t1_fg7xzt5,1580613628.0,"That's just the point. You don't know what goes on in the locker room and the letters are literally there so that when the C isn't on the ice, there's someone delegated to talk to the ref on behalf of the team. It could be as simple as ""Benn and Seguin are always on ice together so we want to spread that out.""

In nearly 30 years of watching hockey, there's a lot you can argue about or disagree with, even I'm guilty of armchair GM'ing, especially around draft time. That said, ya can't disagree with the team on picking out their leaders. It's not a thing that gets fucked up."

hockey,ffg5rip,t1_fff645m,1579899049.0,"There's a lot to go into this but the gist is, if Detroit doesn't let in 5 goals in the 2nd period, we're fine.

The team doesn't have a lot of talent but at the end of the day, our team is stubborn as fuck. It has been a problem with Blashill, with the new guys coming up, and even our old guard of Zetterberg and Kronwall (they personally mention it in an interview from a few years ago). If their zone entries don't work, they keep fuckin doing it until it works one time, pat themselves on the back for their determination, and realize they're losing 4-1. We don't make adjustments well and that is on every level. If our game plan starts well and the other team figures out how to avoid it, the Wings shit themselves.

At the end of the day, Detroit is easy. Shut down Larkin/Larkin's line, make the rest of the team beat you. If Bernier or Howard put up 47 saves and shut you out, good on em, they earned it. If Hronek single handedly plays defense and shits you down, congrats lil buddy, ya earned it. If Zadina, Smith, Nielsen, etc... Score a brace, sick man, ya earned it... But those things won't happen every game."

Is he worth an AHL/7th D (McIlrath) and a 3rd? Probably not. Is he worth more than a 6th? I'd think so."
