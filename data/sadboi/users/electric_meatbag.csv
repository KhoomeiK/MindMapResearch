askpsychology,fo8klwl,t3_g5yu7k,1587598390.0,"I've got two close friends who had psychotic episodes. My best friend had her first when she was going to university  taking 6 classes, experiencing her first heart break and smoking A LOT of weed. She has since been diagnosed with Schizophrenia and later Schizoaffective Disorder.

My second friend came to stay with me for a bit and immediately began presenting with paranoid delusions regarding Hell's Angels, the illuminati, and some yogis in India that were all part of a spiritual attack on her. She also had numerous anxiety attacks over this per day. She refused to let me take her to a doctor or to be assessed in any way, so I gave her a remedy for chronic stress that I take for my anxiety called ""Serenity Formula."" Within days she had less and less panic attacks, talked about less and less about the supposed schemes against her, and started behaving like her usual self. I was told later by mutual friends that she had been doing a lot of meth, which led me to believe this psychosis was likely drug-induced. She was in a far better state when she left me, but tragically, she died months later when she fell from a very high train tressel bridge. I don't know if she had started doing meth again; my guess is yes, since the event happened in the town where all the drug related issues had started.

I am by no means an anti-drug advocate, but being so close to these people during psychosis that correlated with substance abuse taught me in a very real way that drugs ARE NOT for everyone. RIP my wild, zany, funny friend. I wish so much that I could have helped more.

EDIT: tho it's true math can also drive you crazy and is not for everyone, that is a story for another time. Seems my autocorrect can't handle the truth!"

I once lived w my bf and several roomies and experienced a terrible bout of it myself. My bf at the time had severe MDD and we were having difficulties in our sex life because of it. The roomie I shared a wall with would often have his gf come over around 11 pm, just as we were drifting to sleep, and have SCREAMING loud sex with her. Not only was I grumpy due to being kept from sleep/woken up, but I was so SO resentful and jealous because I was so hurt and frustrated by my situation. 

I did ask him if they could try to keep it down a bit, or maybe if she could.come over earlier, but things only improved marginally after that. It really only got better once he moved out.
