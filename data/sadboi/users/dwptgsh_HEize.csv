I think mine are disgusting, but I don't project that on to other people, not even subconsciously as you seem to be doing.

Needafriend,fipfgjr,t3_f8zofg,1582605427.0,I didn't put my gender in the title and only made it somewhat obvious near the end of my the post I made a little while ago. Got one direct message.
