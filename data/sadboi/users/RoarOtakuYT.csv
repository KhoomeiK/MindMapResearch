That’s why I’ve had panic attacks even seeing fursuit nearly a decade after having left the whole thing.

I had many hopes and dreams at that age; I had a fursona I liked, and was MOST excited for getting a fursuit of it. No, the fursuits weren't the problem. I know they're all cute and fun, but it's what they relate to that triggers me. Last halloween I had a panic attack when a couple fursuiters showed up, and I hadn't even seen a picture of a fursuit in over six years at that point. >.<"
