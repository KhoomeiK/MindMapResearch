NoMansSkyTheGame,fqqzr32,t3_gk8say,1589574929.0,"Only been playing after living ships were here so I only spent 25 bucks and had a lot of fun. I feel I have hit a wall and might stop playing.  I more than got my money's worth. Flying around in a less-than-ideal living ship looking for eggs is immensely boring to me. What was worse was looking for a s class ship that I only ever saw one time in the wild in this game and it never landed again.  Both of my S Class ships were only found because of the coordinate Exchange.  Now on the flip side I did buy Fallout 76 day one and I absolutely can't stand it and feel cheated but there are many people who love it. But just imagine for a moment that hello games was charging each item you buy with nanites both the ship upgrades and the everyday you login they have a different ship that you would have to pay five bucks or if you wanted or If other players could just steal all the chlorine you just spent 4 hours making. Well the game may have flaws at least for me I had a lot of fun while it lasted. I do hope future updates improve the diversity both the planets and what's on them, imagine if at the end of The Atlas story you actually got to create a system of your choosing the number of planets where is at in the galaxy and then you could actually go visit it.  There is a lot of potential in this game and I think that is why some of you are upset at it didn't get close enough to your vision and that it got released before it was ready I wish that more of what you want comes to be"

I desperately tried to reel him back in and show him that the web sites he was going to and the YouTube videos were garbage but nothing would reach him.  These bots act as bait on a hook, they keep changing up the pitch before they find one that causes them to land their fish.  Hell I might even been manipulated as Russia was also spending millions of dollars to convince people that fracking is dangerous I obviously believe fracking is dangerous but now I have to question my belief.  Questioning beliefs is a good thing and yes you should have doubt when it comes to any information but what Russia has succeeded in doing is convincing millions of Americans that are media is corrupt and that journalism no longer exists"

Agreeing on Military spending is a great way to get reelected and Russia has been moving extremely aggressive, we are in a cold war again and I believe Putin sees war as his best option I fully believe there is a chance they will attack this year before the election, now it's far more likely they will just continue the digital War and throw their support behind anti-vaxxers even more than they have previously.  Russia is physically encroaching on Turkey Ukraine and Syria that will continue and it would not surprise me if they tried to swallow up other Eastern European countries.  If Russia breaks NATO which they are closer to than ever before, Europe is at extreme risk and trump has made it clear they can't count on us.

Trump is well known for sleeping with prostitutes most famously Stormy Daniels, in Russia there are many circumstances in which people have been blackmailed by the government with videos made during their escapades, was he foolish enough to get caught?does that tape involve water sports? That seems unlikely.  But what has been proven is that Russia hacked the dnc and the gop but only the dnc info was leaked.  Russia provided substantial aid to trump which he was fully aware of we dont know what price Trump has paid for that assistance we know he tried to allow Russia access to oil but that was cut off and we know trump has spoken very favorable of Putin and Russia at every turn and denies their involvement in the hack at every turn dispite clear evidence."
