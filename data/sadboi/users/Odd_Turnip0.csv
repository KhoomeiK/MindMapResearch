ClashRoyale,fp761on,t3_gbk987,1588364706.0,Update: it's still going....
audible,fky35zc,t1_fky2ska,1584640500.0,"Thank you for the fast answer! 

I had the feeling that's gonna be the case. I don't really see a point either but it is what it is.."
ClashRoyale,f81aio3,t1_f8170bv,1574158714.0,I have a Samsung J5 I think (I'm not really sure..) .. But I noticed that it only happens when I move the game to my SD card..
ClashRoyale,f816luy,t3_dyhruc,1574152724.0,I already uninstalled and re-downloaded it... Doesn't help..
niceguys,f6wpjh6,t1_f6wn64l,1573231949.0,They shouldn't put an english title to that post though... But rather make a title in the same language as the post..
AskReddit,evoa5dd,t1_evo931e,1564641904.0,Nice
AskReddit,evjtpbb,t1_evjseqy,1564569620.0,Nope. Just a socially awkward person that doesn't know how reddit works yet but made an account anyway.
AskReddit,evjiiw3,t1_evjg2uy,1564563158.0,I don't really remember if I said thanks tbh. I think I did though.
AskReddit,evjfvt2,t1_evjepgv,1564561665.0,It was just a strange situation because we didn't talk not before and not after. We just went back to today whatever we were doing.
AskReddit,evjcyzl,t1_evjax95,1564560013.0,I agree. I cried like a baby at the end. But re-watching it just wouldn't be the same.
AskReddit,evjclef,t3_ck57es,1564559794.0,"I was going home in a flixbus and there was this dude sitting next to me. I didn't know him at all.
 
He was eating pringles and I guess I stared at them because I was really hungry. He tilted the pringles to my side and it looked like he was offering me some. I was confused and looked at him and he kind of nodded at me. This was the sign for me that he actually is offering me to take one. So I took one out of the can. He didn't say anything and we didn't talk at all the rest of the journey. It was weird and until this day I'm still not sure if he actually was offering me one. But then again he didn't say anything when I reached into the can."
AskReddit,evjbg3q,t3_ck55xg,1564559129.0,American horror story. Love that show but going through the seasons again with knowing what will happen is no fun anymore.
AskReddit,evixqa8,t3_ck438i,1564551510.0,This love by maroon 5. Yet I always have to sing along when I hear it and I hate it.
AskReddit,evix169,t1_eviwt34,1564551109.0,"Nah I won't lol 
I was just happy about it."
AskReddit,eviwspj,t1_evivixn,1564550967.0,Okay then I misunderstood. I'm gonna check it out again then.
AskReddit,eviwp3u,t1_evivcb6,1564550909.0,"Thanks! 
I really just used one of those ""recommended"" by reddit. Because I always spend years trying to find one."
AskReddit,eviwevh,t1_eviv7sf,1564550754.0,Yeah I guess I gave the right answer at the right time.
AskReddit,eviu80r,t1_evhc7kr,1564549510.0,I checked out that subreddit already but I think that's not really what this is. People there seem to be bothered that they do this when I'm not. Or maybe I just didn't understand it right.
AskReddit,evit8qv,t1_evhqxjo,1564548891.0,"I've had this too very few times. 
It's like I get a Deja-vu and then I have no clue if I dreamt the moment I remember or if it actually happened."
AskReddit,evit2rm,t1_evhg30t,1564548773.0,I don't remember that either.
AskReddit,evgyqc6,t1_evgyf3m,1564517892.0,Works for me. You should try it.
AskReddit,evgm6ou,t1_evglyko,1564512409.0,Explains a lot.
AskReddit,evglt05,t1_evgkgi9,1564512249.0,Nice sounds like a fun party. But I imagine this being all over the place. I wouldn't even know what's going on with these many characters.
AskReddit,evglizg,t1_evglb95,1564512129.0,It's really just day dreaming while laying in bed.
AskReddit,evgjlnp,t1_evgik77,1564511352.0,Are you obsessed with history too? Lmao
AskReddit,evg83m4,t1_evg7jjh,1564507024.0,"I don't know. I just kinda start somewhere sometimes even in the middle of a story and make something out of it. Sometimes I even change it up mid story because I didn't like the way it was going or something. 

Though I can't do that when I'm asleep of course. Lol"
AskReddit,evfol4c,t1_evfmprb,1564498900.0,When I do this during the day this can happen to me too. Not with assassins creed though.
AskReddit,evfhhe5,t1_evfh9oa,1564495856.0,You mean like picture the people in your head and imagine what they could say and talk about?
AskReddit,evfg1g2,t1_evffpvw,1564495155.0,"There's no dragons in my stories but all sorts of weird things or dystopian things. Safe zones, mutants, witches and things like that."
AskReddit,evfeawz,t3_cjrst4,1564494272.0,I don't ever let doctors take blood samples from me because it horrifies me. Even typing this and thinking about it makes me really uncomfortable.
mentalhealth,evfb1ow,t3_cjpxq3,1564492521.0,You too! ðŸ’œ
AskReddit,evfaup5,t1_evfans9,1564492416.0,In my stories I'm a witchy vampire kind of thing most of the times.
AskReddit,evfahfq,t1_evfaffc,1564492206.0,Maybe we are crazy people...
AskReddit,evf2i7m,t1_evf2dlj,1564486765.0,Well I guess there's something wrong with the both of us then.
AskReddit,evex6b2,t3_cjo9sq,1564482065.0,"I just make up stories in my head. Sometimes I'm in the world of a TV show I like or in my own little dream universe I made where I have made up characters and such. And eventually I just fall asleep doing this.

Edit:may not be that much but I'm actually really happy about 1.8k upvotes on my first comment ever. Thank you!"
