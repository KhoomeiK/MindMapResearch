Please get unemployment welfare - that is what it is there for. It will at least help to alleviate bills etc. If you still feel bad, spend it on furthering your amazing works of art. Think of this as just an extended time to work on your book. Please try to do one nice thing for yourself each day."

I wish I had bought it now. At least just to try. So is it about the same price as meth?
