occult,fqzi61c,t3_gld8me,1589767896.0,"Does the world occult not essentially mean ""hidden wisdom""?

The way I like to look at it (and please correct me if this is inaccurate) is that ""magic"" isn't magic, but more like manipulation. If you understand certain laws and aspects of nature/the universe, you can use that understanding to manipulate them in a way that will lead to a more positive outcome for yourself. 

To me it's the practice of wisdom and knowledge to better myself and basically achieve eudaimonia.

If that tells you anything though, it's that there are others who feel this way. 

Try putting yourself in social situations where you are likely to meet others. See if you can find any common ground with anyone. Sometimes finding people you jive with is hard. Not to mention conversation in general seems to becoming a lost art, making it that much harder. You could even try messaging a Facebook friend or someone you wouldn't normal talk to over social media. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with starting a conversation just for the sake of it. Online, or in person. Humans are at such a social disconnect these days"
relationship_advice,flv6lyd,t1_flv19rf,1585517463.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to type this out. Your reply is very insightful and helpful. A lot of your points really clarify some of my own thoughts I've been having. Earlier on, I actually considered that maybe he just likes the perks of being in a relationship. I mean, he got attached pretty quickly. It kind of felt like he latched on to the first person to give him attention :/

He was actually in the military, and made it sound like he also had his whole life planned out, which is one of the reasons I was attracted to him. I mean he had a career and clear aspirations for the future, much like I have my aspirations. However he decided decide to quite shortly after he was deployed to help with a flooding crisis. And honestly while he was deployed he complained to me every time we talked, and he ended up leaving early. Now he has no idea what he wants to do, which is his right... but he shows no desire to even consider career options. This stresses me out a little because I know where I'm going and I don't really want to end up a head of my partner.

I should mention that he does have a history of cheating... however that was in his high school years so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I'm honestly not sure if he would cheat or not given the opportunity. 

I agree that animals have good intuition... I found some rather disturbing things in his search history such as  ""how long does it take a dog to suffocate"" and ""hit a dog on the head hard"", as well as ""signs of animal abuse""...  this genuinely scared me as I feared that he hurt or was planning to hurt my dog, or even get ride of him. He is alive and well other than his anxiety around my boyfriend though. Still makes me sad that hes so timid now, as he is a very social, people loving dog. When my boyfriend's friends come over, my dog greets them and brings them toys and stuff, so it's just my boyfriend he is weird about.

The fact that he did talk trash about me like that kind of hurt actually, because I had thought that his friends would kind of become my friends as well... but now I feel like they view me in a sort of tainted light. He seems to be very good at playing the victim, but none of those people see the side of him that I see. Sometimes I wish they did though. I did confront him on this one, and he said ""I'm allowed to vent to my friends"". He excused his lies as harmless exaggerations because he was mad.

As for talking to him about everythinge else, I have, many times. He gets very defensive or upset. Sometimes he straight up says ""if you leave I can't stop you"", but there is no emotion in his voice at all. It's like he doesnt understand the seriousness of my feelings. Or the last time I brought it up, he said ""this is who I am, take it or leave it"". He made me feel like I don't approve of him as a person, and I really don't know how to deal with that accusation being put on me. I don't think he is his behavior... but if that's how he wants to be I cant stop him, I guess.

I'm not sure if this is important either, but when I don't feel like having sex, he gets upset about that as well. Even though he went through a very long period of time having a low sex drive. I'm not sure why me having a lower sex drive is even an issue... we both have other things to worry about. Sometimes he'll say things like I'm not attracted to him, when really I'm just stressed.

Honestly in a lot of ways I find him to be very childish, and I don't think this is the person I want to get married to and have children with. I'm really hoping that he can own up to his wrongs and face himself, but he always chooses the easy way out it seems. That being said I do still love him, but I'm just not sure if we are romantically compatible. 

I wouldn't even know how to go about breaking up with him... no doubt he would absolutely demonize me. Not to mention the chaos of sorting our living situation out."

Just give it time and eventually you will meet someone that you genuinely jive with. If you don't enjoy dating, don't. Wanting a human connection like that is normal, but if I were you I would shift my focus onto things that are more so in your control (like yourself, your hobbies, pursuing a goal, etc).

I have thought about meds. I do take adderall, mostly to help curb my horrible procrastination habits- but I have noticed that it helps with my social anxiety in the sense that I'm not overthinking everything going on around my (people in class for example). I've noticed it reduces some minor symptoms of social anxiety when taking it, such as blushing when people talk to me.

Eventually I'm going to look into CBT for myself, but I need to get through this school year before I can even think about anything like that. I imagine it takes a lot of energy at first, and school drains me of that.

Things would most definitely be different if I didn't have social anxiety. I always overthink the smallest potential comments or response I could make in a social setting, until the moment passes and they become irrelevant. I feel like anyone who has ever known me (other than my bf), never go or gets, to know the real me because I keep the real me hidden out of fear of being an embarrassment to myself, or saying something cringey or offputting or wrong etc... Most people just brush me off as reserved; but I know reserved can get boring really fast, hence why anyone I've ever tried to become friends with ultimately gradually distances themselves from me, never have gotten to truly know who I am. It doesn't help that social anxiety has also robbed me of my social skills, so I always feel awkward and definitely come across as awkward the odd time I make an attempt to not be so 'reserved'. I'm 19 years old and my social life is depressing, and I fear that's all it will ever be. Sometimes that thought alone defeats me entirely. When you're 19 and 22, people tell you that youre young still and blah blah blah... but the reality is that these are supposed to be the best years of our lives- when it's the easiest to get out and be social and make new friends...

Also, I do understand there are ""female lodges"", however I read these lodges aren't official. I would look into joining The Order of the Eastern Star, but I am not directly related to a masom other than my great uncle though marriage, and whom I've never met since he passed before I was born. I've had an interest in freemasonry since before I ever knew my uncle was a freemason, so I'll admit it was pretty cool to find that out.

It's not something I worry about too much though because I do have a life, it would just be a bonus to become a part of something greater than myself and improve my life, and the lives of others. I by no means have my hopes up that things will ever change, so it is what it is. I just needed to rant, apparently."
