(Yes, I literally never thought to Google my favorite author for over 10 years ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But those 4 books made me happy when I was sad and carried me through a lot, not sure why it spoke to me so much, so I never felt like I needed anything else) 

I tore through every series so fast and loved every bit but after being head over heals for everything in the Lioness quartet I was disappointed to see how Alanna was portrayed. It was kind of like the bubble around my perfect world of fantasy was popped. 

Then I got the books on audible and slowly listened to them all again while traveling hours on the road for work. 

Totally different understanding and appreciation for Alanna and how she developed. I think it would have been more out of character if she had grown up to be a charming, eager to please, and overly friendly. 

It seemed more fitting for her to grow up as she did. I think what she had to do to get to her standing in life and what she still has to do has left her hardened. 
The only time I remember her seeming vulnerable or truly open is around George. I think George is the only person Alanna can relax and for once not be ""Alanna the Lioness"" of ""Kings Champion"" around."

I don't hear about a ton of healthcare workers dropping dead during the flu season. Maybe I am not paying as close attention other years and this does happen.

FIL was definitely less intense in 2014 and 2015. 
But Trump came around and it's disgusting what these people feel comfortable expressing. They say it with such confidence too. As if it's totally acceptable to be a bigoted, racist POS."
Coronavirus,fln7ysb,t1_fln716r,1585311957.0,"Absolutely, I agree with you completely. 
The more I've been told to go on site recently the more I realize how many people do not care. 
I would take 2 weeks without pay if it meant we all could go on lockdown.

I can see past my bills and how big of a problem this is going to be. I feel like I'm stuck in a rock and a hard place. Sure, I can take 2 weeks off without pay but unless everyone does that the spread isn't stopping. It delays me getting it and that's about it."
IHaveCoronavirus,fln211g,t3_fpulhw,1585306184.0,"I do not have it but seems like a lot of people are recommending to call a doctor to determine what you should do. 
Less serious cases are probably going to be told to stay at home and not come in. It's not worth the risk of infecting others. 

This thing seems to be lasting a while and can get worse. You're only on day 4...

Get in contact with a health professional and if your ability to breathe worsens or anything serious in that sense go to the hospital."
politics,fln1eum,t1_flmkbnq,1585305479.0,"They *feel like they* get the right to say and do whatever they want. That's what the cult followers get from this. 

My father in law LOVES trump ""because he speaks just like me. Regular old guy who tells it like it is""

My FIL is now more racist and close minded than he has ever been. He's nearing 70 and has grown up in the Midwest and Florida. 
I met him 5 years ago and it was never a serious issue. A couple comments here in there but it was never downright hateful - since Trump was elected he's said things that make my boyfriend and me go dead silent. My boyfriend is honestly pretty heartbroken about it. 
Trumps cult of followers are so emboldened by his stupidity and disregard for humans. It's disgraceful."

Coronavirus,flmznb7,t1_flmy7e1,1585303414.0,"Seriously though. The majority of these construction jobs serve no immediate purpose. They aren't on the front lines like HCP, grocery stores, gas stations, banks, sanitation crews.
Those other fields are actually essential. I do not understand how construction was deemed essential."
Coronavirus,flmzk39,t1_flmy7e1,1585303303.0,"Oh, shit. I hope you are doing alright.
But that's absolutely possible and another huge issue. 
The workers are still going into restaurants and gas stations. No one is giving a rats ass on the sites about spreading it. 
For this reason alone I believe they all should be shut down. They aren't taking it seriously and are going to put many people at risk by their careless attitudes.

They are deemed essential by money hungry folks and then no extra money is put into keeping the workers safe who are forced to be there to get paid. 

I mean, it's clear to everyone that if these new multi million dollar apartment complexes had to be halted for 2 weeks the world would completely end. Right? /s"
Coronavirus,flmykz8,t1_flm7tbf,1585302132.0,"What's best for me is to stay home and I would if my company would allow me to take any of my PTO for this. But unless I get sick or my boyfriend gets sick and I grt that mandated sick leave then I'm stuck. They are no longer approving PTO requests.

I have too many bills to pay and a company that is concerned about cash flow not employee health - even though we literally haven't had any jobs shut down or unpaid invoices since this started to become serious in the US."
Coronavirus,flmyet6,t1_flm7tbf,1585301924.0,"Oh absolutely. I don't think they should remain open. The hourly workers deserve to be paid time off. They deserve to be at home social distancing. Not working in pretty unhygienic places and potentially bringing this virus home to loved ones. 
There's no real reason that these job sites are being deemed essential. It's all greed and profit based. That's it. 
I can think of ONE project out of the 20 we have that is vital and needs to be finished. The rest could and should be shutting down."
Coronavirus,flm6vfa,t1_fll1272,1585275974.0,"Construction field here. Not only are they ""essential"" they are in full swing. So many jobs can be done easier with schools out, people WFH, and traffic is down. 

However, I have yet to be on a single site that has done anything regarding the virus. No extra hygiene stations. Workers barely care. A group teased me for using hand sanitizer before eating a snack. A ton of contractors travel from different places so it's a ton of people from all over who come together and don't practice social distancing.
If/when it gets loose on these sites almost every person there is fucked."
Coronavirus,fllwbrc,t1_fllti6z,1585269110.0,"Puzzles have been helping me pass the time quite a bit. 
Maybe go through your clothes or a messy closet or drawer? Organizing helps me stay centered in a time like this. 
Knitting is fun too but would require purchasing supplies."
AskReddit,fllhjha,t1_fljxwye,1585260450.0,"Same. Same. Corporate office is working from home. Our smaller office who works 60/40 (office/construction site) is not allowed to work from home when we have office days.

I've been traveling these past 4/7 days on to job sites all over the state and if I brought it back from this it's almost guaranteed my office mates get it.
My company can't actually give me a reason why we can't work from home (on office days). They just say no and say the small office can social distance well enough. All while sitting at home on their computers and never having to travel anywhere on site."
