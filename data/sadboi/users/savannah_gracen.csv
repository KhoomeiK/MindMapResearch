books,fbiry3w,t3_ed7r1k,1576911560.0,Looking for romance books. Either sugary sweet cutesy ones or ones that will leave me sobbing on my bathroom floor in the middle of the night for 4 hours and nothing in between.

teenagers,f2dnl54,t3_dd1kjq,1570159118.0,Idk why people make such a big deal about teenagers going trick or treating.... We could be doing drugs for God's sake.  18 seems like a good place to stop though. It's always fun to hang out with your friends and eat candy while watching scary/halloween movies.

AskReddit,eyz6b5f,t3_cz2apy,1567610569.0,I have a small scar on my cheek from when my mom hit me in the face with a garbage bag. I snuck up on her in the kitchen when I was 8 and I was told not to go there but I was a rebellious piece of crap and startled her. The garbage bag had pieces of wood with nails on it. My mom felt really bad even though it was an accident and bought me hello Kitty and Disney princess Band-Aids.

Celiac,eut94mx,t3_chasy3,1564022153.0,Make sure when you serve the food to keep the gluten free stuff away from the food with gluten and always ask what precautions they think are necessary. As a person with celiac disease I'm extremely grateful for people like you who are very considerate and look out for us :)
