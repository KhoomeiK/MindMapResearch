OMAD isn‚Äôt just for weight loss, the only way to lose weight is through a caloric deficit, you don‚Äôt need to be under a caloric deficit to do OMAD. There‚Äôs many body builders and people who want to gain weight that do OMAD for its other benefits. I suggested OMAD because of your comment on not feeling satisfied when eating your meals and because you also stated how you feel like you‚Äôll never stop eating and gaining weight. Also, why post this in a subreddit called ‚Äúlose it‚Äù if you aren‚Äôt seeking advice to lose weight or want to lose weight anyway. Obviously this isn‚Äôt the right place for you."
