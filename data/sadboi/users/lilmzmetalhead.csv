-username is because I love metal music :)

I am from Central Virginia (Richmond Metropolitan Area). I went off birth control right before Christmas. My husband and I decided to go NTNP and once I go through my first cycle post-BC, we will actively try. Already had my BC withdrawal bleed. I take Ritual vitamins and just asked for the prenatals for my next subscription which should come in less than a week. We have a prenatal consult at the end of the month.

I am a unit secretary at a local hospital. Before that, I worked at a landfill for ten years. That work environment wouldn't be great for me as a mother since I already had issues with PTO. Now that I am a unit secretary, I only work 3 days a week (12 hrs shifts) and this would significantly save on daycare and my mom already said she would babysit on the Saturdays that my husband and I have to work.

Met the hubby on OkCupid. We've been together for six years, married for three years TODAY! We bought a house in August and decided we would start trying in 2020...and here we are.

My primary medical concerns are my weight (I am 5'3"" and 208 pounds) and my issues with chronic pain. I have fibromyalgia and had a spinal fusion in 2009 which gives me a little trouble at times. However, I am in the process of getting my doctors in the loop about TTC so we can work through those issues accordingly. They've been aware for some time that I'm near that window of wanting to try and they've given me great advice. I've been eating healthy, walking 12,000 steps per day, and getting my core worked out more so my back won't take as much of a beating."
