Sounds to me like that was your way of coping stress, through avoidance (of what needs to be done). I do this too; I end up avoiding my studies by indulging in doing what I love. 

Engaging in your hobbies to destress is totally fine, and being unable to focus on your studies at the same time is also normal. What you need to do is to break this habit.

Start small. Download social media blocking apps, make your environment suitable for studying, set a goal for what you want to revise within a set of minutes. Read up on the pomodoro technique because that's where I started when I was breaking my own habit. Good luck!"
