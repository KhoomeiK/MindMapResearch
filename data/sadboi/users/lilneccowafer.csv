I understand it’s frustrating when someone else “parents” your child(ren) in ways like this, but you need to effectively choose your words and be firm with your parenting. You can’t be mad at her because she basically outsmarted you.

As an aside — I know it’s odd or even offensive seeing your developing daughter wanting and wearing ‘sexy’ clothes, but please remind yourself that she is in fact still a child. Unless she’s legitimately begging to dress like a full-on stripper or w/e, anyone who is viewing her and her clothes sexually or “indecently” as you describe is at fault for such indecency. Not her. Like I said, I know it’s weird, and it’s definitely fine to be a little upset about it — but please take time to evaluate your language when speaking to her about it. You want to protect her, not sexualize or infantilize her."

It’s often linked to reputability because many vets recommend it, but the truth is much murkier. Hill’s actually *patented* the term [“prescription diet”](https://thecheerfulvet.com/veterinary-straight-talk-pet-food-pandemonium/), so most commercial sellers will avoid stocking it entirely to ‘avoid making waves,’ thus it’s mostly only available through vet clinics via “prescription.”

Your sister may have some extreme opinions (which you are rightfully concerned about), but you’re kind of acting as a helicopter parent here. There is a difference between protecting your daughter and infantilizing her. Yes, she’s probably impressionable and ‘dumb’ like most teenagers, but if she’s old enough to date then this behavior from you will definitely appear almost contradictory in her eyes. She’s old enough to make her own decisions and hear different opinions without being told what to believe, and she’s certainly old enough to form her own opinion that you’re full of shit and overprotective when you tell her that your sister’s ideals are ridiculous and not to be listened to. There are other ways you could have gone about this without inadvertently insulting your daughter’s intellectual ability to understand her aunt’s opinions and form her own.

I want to be on your side here ‘cause I agree for the most part, but you’re really only pushing away your daughter and sister like this. Sorry OP"

The uncertainty of that statement tells me that you made the right decision.

Edit: something about this post kept bothering me and I couldn’t put my finger on it. I kept re-reading and trying to decipher what it was about the way you talk about your ex that made me so uncomfortable. It’s one thing to dwell on the issue if you’re still hurting, but it’s another to make her participate in it by sending her gifts as reminders. Not just reminders of her ex, either - stop thinking selfishly for a second and think of how she felt receiving those.

She sunk 5 years into what she thought was a stable relationship, building a foundation for the lives ahead of you, and you basically told her to wait another 10 years. Then when she told you that she won’t be able to handle it, it’s going to hurt her...you try to keep it working for a year? Knowing fully it’s bothering her? You can’t have your cake and eat it too. And *then* when you send her these gifts you have the audacity to completely disregard how she may feel about it when she ghosts you, instead opting for feeling sorry for yourself that she didn’t text you a “thanks” for the literal reminders of how she isn’t ever going to be good enough for you. Even after all the time and work and love.

Fuck, that line “*she isn’t perfect”* really kills me the most. You clearly do not care for her like you (maybe) used to. In this post, you don’t consider her feelings outside of how they affect you. Good fucking god, you somehow dated this woman for 5 years and you’d describe her as “not perfect.” The most merit you give her character is that she’s “intelligent” which you “value in a woman.” Would you be shocked to know that most women are intelligent, dude? You talk about her and your relationship like they’re novelties. I can’t imagine how she would feel if she read this and knew it was you.

Either you are wildly out of touch or she is a vessel for you to feel bad for yourself right now. Either way, stop. Let her go and live your damn dream. I know it’s hard filling that hole and feeling so empty, but you both have wants and needs that just do not align. You’re hurting yourself and her by trying to hold on. I have full confidence that you’re amazing at what you do, and you don’t need to worry about a relationship right now. Focus on you."

The nausea it caused was fucking unbearable and it’s really crushing watching yourself basically throw away money and progress. I tried eating food with it, slowly increasing the amount every night, and I found that it took ~1100 calories to offset any initial sickness. The only issue is that it also made me incredibly drowsy, so I took it before bed. Falling asleep on a full stomach + Latuda left me waking up just as nauseous instead.

I deeply regret switching now, though, if it makes any difference to you. The Abilify is not nearly the same and has caused me to gain an uncomfortable amount of weight.

Less than a month later I’m uncontrollably manic to the point of grand delusions and waves of hallucinations. I ended up running away from home out of state via greyhound and disappearing into Chicago for two weeks, scaring my family shitless.
