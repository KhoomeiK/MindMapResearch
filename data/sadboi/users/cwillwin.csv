He's really supportive. But he has boundaries. I need to take my meds, I need to be honest, and I'm responsible for helping myself during my depressive and manic episodes (in that, I am responsible for using my DBT skills, taking my meds, and going to therapy.) 

He's my buddy and we do well together."
BipolarReddit,fo759ok,t3_g5r93p,1587572484.0,"I took a gap year during medical school. I contacted the professors that I wanted to take during the next year and got their syllabus so that I could read the books beforehand. I also did research. The research kept me busy and I had a good time doing it. 

I took 2 years off and at first, I felt so anxious and ashamed. I felt like I was making the wrong choice. But looking back, I really needed those 2 years to get my head straight. I went to an outpatient program, I grew new skills (like DBT and doing research,) and I learned about talking to the disability office. 

Please talk to the disability office at school. Bipolar really affects learning sometimes and it'll be good to have them as part of your team. I also talked to my dean and it's been really helpful having her support me 100%. Having them on my team made my transition back into school a lot easier. I had people who were concerned for me and wanted me to succeed. And I also get extra time on tests, which is great because I was having some problems with concentration for a while."

Ask a lot of questions. Some of the things that you think are normal, are not. Many people don't struggle with depression like we do.

This happened to me after I was diagnosed and put on medication too - the brain fog, the inability to do simple math problems in my head, the inability to retain information. Adderall extended release really helped me. 

For me, I think that the brain fog started after I was diagnosed because my manic and depressive episodes had been masking my ADHD. When I was manic, I was able to work like a machine and retain information well. When I was depressed, I blamed my inability to focus on the depression, rather than the ADHD. When I finally treated the manic episodes and depressive episodes, (1) a lot of the studying tactics that I'd adopted didn't work for me anymore, and (2) the ADHD was in full power mode. Treating the ADHD helped me regain my ability to retain information. 

TLDR: The bipolar might have been masking a co-morbidity like ADHD. Treating it might help you regain your ability to retain information."

Unless they're your psychiatrist, their comments and suggestions are just silly chatter."
BipolarReddit,fgnuc6i,t1_fgmm8yz,1580953083.0,"I completely agree with this. I don't engage with people who talk to me about my medications (outside of my doctor.) They're not qualified to talk to me about my meds, they don't know what I've been through to get here, and they probably don't really care about my long, exhaustive history with medications and bipolar."
BipolarReddit,fgnfn9s,t1_fgnfk7r,1580943853.0,Sure!
C25K,fgku23x,t3_eyz0lu,1580873608.0,Whoooo! Go you!
BipolarReddit,fgktrvy,t3_eyzx49,1580873424.0,"It's really awful that you feel tired, lethargic and depressed. Feeling that way sucks. I'd try the abilify. The abilify was fine for me, but it's different for everyone. You won't really know until you try it. It could really work well for you and help you. 

Also, I would read up on all the side effects of both medications and as soon as you feel one of them, you have the language to tell your doctor about what's going on."
BipolarReddit,fgktept,t3_eyxmw5,1580873191.0,It's really helped me. I have really bad separation anxiety and it helps me manage it. There's a huge difference between how I feel today and how I felt before I started my medication. I no longer stay up at night worrying about things. I can sleep.
BipolarReddit,fgkt8pk,t3_ez1gtq,1580873089.0,"I agree that medication is only one part of how we can take care of ourselves. Part of what makes me healthy is having good relationships with my lover, friends, and family. It also helps when I do DBT, eat well, sleep on time, and take walks outside."
BipolarReddit,fgkt0dg,t1_fgk32ri,1580872946.0,me too. It pulled me out of my depression. It's great!
