The cops have been called on them by other neighbors and us. I email the apartment complex at 1 a.m. when things are actually going on and record videos any time they are being obnoxious. We have seen some things posted on their door during the past month and yesterday I saw a piece of mail from the Sheriff’s office in the mail box (which has been open for a couple of weeks, because I assume these people are oblivious to anything but themselves) soo we kinda hope they’re being evicted. It’s been a saga. I think I’m just sensitive to noise and it’s magnified by loud “city noises” that feel intrusive to my personal space.

I don’t remember her giving an explanation as to why (now that I’m older I think she was being horribly abused). So she was lightly tracing my back, which I did think felt good. So OK. That’s fine. She told me about “having to” do something with a girl at this party as she was rubbing my back. OK, ummm. She kept asking me to do more and I awkwardly kept declining. It was a weird experience. Then there were a couple of girls who would playfully start wrestling with me (one time another friend was there when this was happening with one of the girls) and pin themselves on top of me.
