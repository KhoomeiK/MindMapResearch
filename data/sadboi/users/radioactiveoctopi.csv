nvidia,fpurrfm,t1_fpufskv,1588921513.0,I plan on getting more but I’ve read that 4 can be a performance hit at times. Now with the motherboard that I chose it should work out well. In reality I was thinking of waiting until 32gb sticks become a solid option so I can go up to 128 which my board is supposed to be able to handle if I’m not mistaken

nvidia,fpucvqw,t1_fptxz86,1588909831.0,2 16gb sticks. Just a huge heat sink. I’ll probably get 2 more soon.
Clojure,fptdxbh,t1_fpsxmg0,1588889481.0,Yeah that seems to be what they do in the book. They do good over and preach separate persistence layers for each service but in their project they may just separate via namespace.

fasting,fprq456,t1_fpqow1o,1588859823.0,Agreed.  Sweat...electrolytes need to be replaced. Absolutely
fasting,fppn7iu,t1_fppjvh1,1588805416.0,I’ve been fine going 10 days without salt. I assume it goes person by person
Gentoo,fopnvgq,t3_g6tfnq,1587966654.0,I ended up installing network manager and using nmcli connect to connect after fighting with wpa_supplicant
emacs,foikwpi,t3_g7b1zr,1587789252.0, Nice! I’ll try it out tomorrow afternoon
AMDHelp,fobreh3,t1_fo9baog,1587662849.0,"Hmm I wish I saw this before buying mine though I’m happy. It’s definitely quiet.  So funny I did have my exhaust fan backwards and I switched that around. Temps stayed the same. I also updated the firmware. No real change. But today it’s running idle in the upper 30s opposed to 48-55.  Its 10 degrees cooler outside but I’m still seeing a 5 degree change. 

I ordered some noctua h2 then when that comes I’ll remove the heat sink and see the paste did spread evenly. If not then I’ll know where I goofed. I feel safe enough to install my second OS today though.  

Also if you do go with the dark pro 4 don’t listen to people saying it’s hard to install. This was actually a pleasure compared to fighting to get a clip based heat sink on and worrying about scratching the board."
AMDHelp,fo9b1di,t1_fo9amnj,1587614782.0,"Ok well that gets me partially there. During a realbench stress test that temperature isn’t right.  I have no real intentions on overclocking...but I wanted to make sure  I get this correct before I install gentoo which can be very heavy on systems as everything is compiled

And the cooler is under 100 but I agree 100%. I don’t believe it should get that high but this is unfamiliar territory. I haven’t built a desktop since 2001.  It should be seated correctly but I’ll try that again and check to make sure the fans are working as they should."

sennheiser,fnf68s5,t3_g10p9w,1586902167.0,Yes and a great family it is. I just came on here to make a very positive customer service post.
buildapc,fnba4wt,t3_g0p77e,1586811897.0,Now I’m concerned about my case. One standoff pre installed and 2 extras. I hear the panzer evo doesn’t need them. The mounts build into the case work for standoffs
buildapc,fnb9bnx,t1_fnb2d5g,1586811485.0,I ended up getting the right dark rock pro 4.  They want 180 for the chromax and that’s cutting into my gpu money

HeadphoneAdvice,fn3ri2s,t1_fn2hhjy,1586626501.0,None. And I’m picky. I wear these for a minimum of 8 hours a day.
HeadphoneAdvice,fn3rfse,t1_fn2pu88,1586626468.0,This is my first pair and for ear buds. Yes they did a great job on these.  They’re absolutely better than AirPods. It’s a toss up between these and the Sony noise canceling buds.  Now if we’re talking over the ear headsets then yes there are better options. If you want wired earbuds like shure etc yes there are better options. But for his price range these do damn well.
HeadphoneAdvice,fn2cx9k,t3_fytmrb,1586584722.0,"I wear power beat pros all day. I’ll say no earbuds that I’ve owned over the last 15 years have stayed in my ears.  These do. The sound, connection range etc are great for me."

Amd,fmcfzan,t1_fmc66yz,1585944932.0,The 3900x  that will be the last thing I buy. I may splurge and go all the way up to 3950x but if I do it won’t really make sense.
Amd,fmc2o0h,t1_fm99dlo,1585937770.0,Yeah I ended up buying the dark rock pro this morning. Just feels like the best buy all around.
nvidia,fmc2juz,t1_fmc2d19,1585937709.0,Lol well the rest of your system is epic. I’m still afraid of water cooling. Maybe one day
nvidia,fmavx67,t3_fttexx,1585909932.0,"Ha! Nice...our builds are going to be similar as far as parts...though I got the Panzer Evo case.

dataisbeautiful,fmar16l,t1_fm8l9do,1585904390.0,They never pay back though. Ford still hasn't paid their loan from 2011. But their bonuses are high again.
Amd,fm97oe8,t1_fm95maa,1585863277.0,"Wow, well thank you. I wonder what I should get now. Dark Rock Pro 4? I actually may go with the noctua nh-d15. That was on my list as well."
Amd,fm97iud,t1_fm95maa,1585863193.0,"Ooh I figured it would work with any of the x570 boards. This is my first build in over a decade.  I would think so? Hmm, time to research."
Amd,fm8wzro,t1_fm8st5q,1585857588.0,I’ll probably be going with the trident neo ram. It doesn’t seem too high
HeadphoneAdvice,fltd7d4,t1_flquyh9,1585467908.0,I like it. Good bass and all around clear sound. Phone calls are better than evenly pxc 550s
HeadphoneAdvice,flqrrst,t3_fqiimq,1585404535.0,I really love the powerbeat pros. Absolutely no ear buds have stayed in my ear to date. I used to have to tie anything I bought to my head with a bandana.  These stay in all day and the sound is great to me. The tips that came with them worked but after I bought a larger tip kit the sound got even better.

emacs,fkcsd5l,t1_fkar8do,1584060054.0,so what was the base?
emacs,fkc6lcr,t1_fkar8do,1584046794.0,Right. I was looking for the initial theme. I actually did install prism last night and added it.  Not too shabby

lisp,fk1li2a,t1_fk0p4d9,1583782084.0,That’s what I’ll do. I have an odd journal project I’ve wanted to make as well. I’ll try CL for that.  It’s very different from any blog/journal that I’ve seen. Almost a personal assistant.
lisp,fjzzz85,t1_fjxnh63,1583735638.0,I definitely move faster with clojurescript than JavaScript. And cross compiling is nice as well. My real concern was the quality of the web servers.  I did end up going ahead and starting my project with clojure but I’ll look to Common Lisp in the future. I bought quite a few CL books and just my two week dive made clojure easier to me
lisp,fjnw0dg,t1_fjnvu1i,1583515449.0,I’ll take a look but I’m really looking to roll my own system for a long term project. But I’ll tinker with this as well.
lisp,fjnv9np,t1_fjnv1k9,1583515059.0,Yeah I watched that last night.  It may not be a bad dev cycle. Sort of a separation of concerns.  Focus on the api then build whatever UIs necessary.
lisp,fjnus03,t1_fjnoudy,1583514806.0,Yeah so what I mean...and truly I don’t know. I’m researching which is why I figured I’d ask. Like what if you wanted to use http2 ?
lisp,fjnulhw,t1_fjnq447,1583514712.0,Right in line with a post I just made. What would be a solid web server choice to use with a common lisp these days?

Web_Development,fjeziou,t1_fjd9e8w,1583281138.0,First start off looking at wiki code. Not Wikipedia but wikis are a common thing. I suggest going on github and looking at some open source code.
