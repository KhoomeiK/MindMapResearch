I believe radiation sickness is caused by many cells dying by that process but only happens when people are hit by a lot (or enough) radiation to cause massive damage to cells and DNA. That much damage isn't exactly replaceable that quickly, especially with junked up blueprints (damaged DNA). But that's usually massive amounts of radiation (or what we consider to be massive), like the ones who are exposed to radiation accidents and cleanup or who are too far to be directly killed by a nuclear explosion but still hit. 

However, just some radiation damaging the DNA causes mutations of one type or another. A lot of mutations are actually benign, as in there is no observable difference in end result due to the radiation hitting junk or repeat DNA, or still mutating important DNA but the amino acid code still reads the same so the resulting protein is still the same. But if the mutation is in key genes *and* changes the code enough so the amino acid code is read differently then it leads to an observable change. Sometimes, these changes are neutral, or it can be good if it gives an advantage to a species or sub-species if it increases the organism's chance of successful reproduction (including surviving until successful reproduction occurs). But, as we are very familiar with, the mutations can be very bad when they hit key genes controlling cell reproduction and cause cancer.

But it also likely has something to do with the remoteness of the communities that harbor it, possibly a combination of misinformation and lack of education and distance from larger populations; not necessarily throughout the countries. I'll go look...

""Unfortunately, children are still missing out on vaccination for various reasons including lack of infrastructure, remote locations, population movement, conflict and insecurity and resistance to vaccination.""

""Nationally, 51% of children participating in the survey received all doses of each antigen irrespective of the recommended date of immunization or recommended interval between doses. About 31% of children were found to be partially vaccinated. Reasons for partial vaccination included: place to vaccinate child too far (23%), not aware of the need of vaccination (17%), no faith in vaccination (16%), mother was too busy (15%), and fear of side effects (11%).""

""The immunization program in Afghanistan was launched in 1978 under the name of “Mass Immunization Program” through the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and was then gradually expanded with the aim of universal immunization coverage throughout the country. Conflict in the late 1970s had a negative impact on immunization and the program was further disrupted in 1999 under the Taliban regime, along with several other health services. In 2001, the MoPH of the new interim authorities had the enormous challenge of building the health care system from scratch.""

""In addition to being heavily dependent on external aid and having weak governance, the health sector also faces the challenges of armed conflict, natural disasters, and internal displacement of an estimated 1.2 million people. Ongoing conflict continues to cause widespread disruption to health services.""

""One of the important shortcomings for calculating immunization coverage in Afghanistan is the absence of accurate population data and therefore the number of target children. The last census held in the country was in 1979. For the last 35 years, the Central Statistics Organization is using projected figures and there is a high degree of uncertainty for figures available.""

""Mothers of children who never received vaccines were asked about reasons for not getting the child immunized. The major reasons given by mothers for never vaccinating their children included: place for vaccination being too far (40%), no faith in immunization (34%), unaware of the need for vaccination (33%), concerns about conflict-related security (21%), and not being allowed to go to a clinic without a male family member or mahrahm (21%). Other reasons mentioned were fear of side effects (18%), being too busy to take the child for vaccination (12%), vaccinator was absent (10%), and/or absence of female vaccinator (9%) at the health facility. Immunization services are free in Afghanistan and cost was not mentioned as an issue.""

""Data from Afghanistan also reveals similar inequities in immunization. While 60% of children from the richest quintile have full immunization coverage, only 38% of children from the poorest quintile have access. Afghanistan has lowest female literacy levels in the world; as per the Education Interim Plan 2011–2013 of the Ministry of Education, the adult female literacy is only 15%.""

I really don't think that many people are being ""duped by anti-vax nonsense"" with all the above considered. Sure, distrust of vaccines is definitely there, but seems to have far more to do with lack of education and illiteracy than buying into any sort of movement and it certainly isn't the primary reason for the low vaccination rates. I also wonder if there could be a comparable rate of distrust for healthcare in general. Specifically, though, mentioning anti-vax is going to make most readers think that these people are choosing to ignore information rather than having an extreme lack of information. 

Call me pedantic but being on a science sub, shouldn't we be scrupulous? I may be very particular with linguistics but I see that primarily as a benefit for communication."

""Despite the progress achieved since 1988, as long as a single child remains infected with poliovirus, children in all countries are at risk of contracting the disease. The poliovirus can easily be imported into a polio-free country and can spread rapidly amongst unimmunized populations. Failure to eradicate polio could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world.""

And 

* Since 1979, no cases of polio have originated in the U.S.
* However, the virus has been brought into the country by travelers with polio. The last time this happened was in 1993.

So I think, collagen bonds are what you are thinking of? And they would be all over the body, er - rather all through the body underneath the skin, and not just the legs.   


However, I don't think every single woman does actually have cellulite. It's super, ridiculously common, but sex isn't the sole determining factor so there is some more genetic components to it and maybe environmental. Reading through this thread gives that idea pretty well: lots of examples of very fit and/or very skinny women with cellulite and lots of examples of the genetic component (skinny grandmother, mother, daughter, etc.) but also a few examples of women who have hardly any to none, even related to women who do have cellulite. Also, consider trans women. I only wanted to point this out because broad generalizations aren't so good whichever way they are painted."
