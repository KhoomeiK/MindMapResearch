ptsd,eyjc81q,t3_cx2rb3,1567116445.0,"I've been feeling that way too, I think maybe guilt is easier to feel then the pain and.maybe if.i work through the guilt it will hurt less, maybe it works both ways. Maybe that's how.we.distance ourselves in an unhealthy way. Thanks for sharing"
ADHD,eydrf5g,t3_cwq1lx,1567023651.0,"You shouldn't change your dosage w/o doctor approval but Therapy has to be open to work they are not an authority figure they are here to help.tell them like you just told it but than ask if it ok. If the say no ask what's appropriate then talk about dosing so you know what is acceptable and how you can do better. medication is a tool to cope and if your in a better state some times you need less. You can only figure it out with preasure over time, self reflection and open communication with your therapist. Good luck"

martialarts,exkrwrv,t3_ctf8g8,1566397526.0,"Change your perspective your not fighting, your navigating a hostile environment being strong enough to fight is part of it but the bigger part is the end game where do you go how do you get there. If you have to become them you lose. dont play there game, play yours. Even if you escape violence this doesnt change. even in the most civil of groups the struggle for dominance doesnt change weather your in the field or on the job. The difference has to be in how you approach it judo is to simple to fix your problem but it can give you an environment that will allow you to grow past your abusers and they cant reach you when you lift yourself past them."
martialarts,exkosnq,t3_ctf8g8,1566395404.0,"So what you really want is to get through your days safely. Fighting has to be plan c in that case. Only when you cant find safety. It doesnt matter if you beat them in a fight they will just come back. I dealt with this when I was a kid except i was tougher than my bullies  then and I could beet them it didt stop the fighting it made me a target. Bullies also know how to press the rules to make you act stupid so you'll get in  trouble and they wont. Situational awareness is key where you go how you get there places that are safe and places that are unsafe. Mostly focus on the things that remove you from the situations you can avoid. Join groups of people that are in the open. Really the only way to be more secure is to connect with more people and be sure of where you want to go. Judo is as good or as bad as you like the people, it will make you stronger as long as that is your goal and you will continuously become better."
martialarts,exkgvux,t1_exkfi9x,1566389089.0,If the trauma is bad never underestimate talking to someone.
martialarts,exkfi9x,t3_ctf8g8,1566387715.0,"Why do you want fight. Martial arts is a tool and can help you reach what you want. Do you need to be a better fighter or do you need to improve your confidence. If your.confidence is linked to your fighting ability you will only be as well as the people you can beet. If you want to be a better fighter it's better to find a good group of like minded people that can push you. If you just bumed that your losing a lot, that's your fight,  the push. If you are afraid of something in your life you might do nothing but struggle against it but strength is what you can endure not what you can make happen and that only comes with pressure over time. What do you want. How to make it happen in an efficiant way and building the strength to make it happen."

ADHD,ev1nkzc,t3_ci5m6d,1564161977.0,"I had that problem the key is limit the spaces you can put the tools. A tool box next to you, or a mat the tools stay, on or a bucket. but the tools are in your hand or in thier place. I also use the tie offs. When this  stops working for me is after a job. if I dont have work for a while I have to search more."
