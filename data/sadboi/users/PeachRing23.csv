I hit 2 years in March, although only 1.5 of them has been at full time.

I don't want to go back to that, and given the state of jobs and the economy, idk what would happen if I were to quit. It isn't really like there's tons of job opportunities opening up.

I've had time to catch up on projects that I've never felt I had the time to do and time to sit with myself and actually sort out what kind of goals I want to set in life.

AskReddit,fkktbbi,t3_fivr0g,1584291494.0,"I can't remember what the exact catalyst was, but when I was 11 (I'm 24 now) I went to different websites and would take tests to see if I had symptoms of depression and they all said yeah. I didn't bring it up to anyone because I knew it wasn't ""normal.""

It wasn't until I was 14 and I started... doing not good things to my arms and considering acting on certain thoughts, that I asked for help. I went to an outpatient facility and learned that my thyroid was fucked up and eventually was able to manage my symptoms.

Today I'm almost 8 years clean of previously mentioned acts, but it's not been easy. I went back on medication 1 1/2 years ago (stopped taking when I was 18) and that's helped a bunch. It's still a struggle but I'm trying to live life as much as I can."

jazzguitar,fkjplnf,t3_fiutfy,1584254130.0,"Not me but my boyfriend is graduating in May from Northern Illinois. He's really enjoyed it and says that if you're in a position where you can spend 2 years focusing on the program you can learn a lot from it. 

He says that when making a final decision on where to go you should consider who you want to study with. Your lessons will be more specialized and you want to work with someone that will be most helpful for the styles/techniques you want to focus on. 

You also need to think about the financial/mental strain that can happen. I know that in my current experience with grad school - not for jazz but for music - working full time has made me feel like I'm not fully learning/focusing on classes and not making the most of the potential relationships and connections I could be making with others in the program.

Overall, yes it's a great learning experience, but there are a lot of variables that you should keep in mind while deciding when/where to go. Hope this was helpful!"

I have so many things that I would love to do but by the time I get home from work I just feel so tired and unmotivated. I've also started online grad school and that pretty much takes up my whole weekends because I can't find focus for it during the week. My new year's resolution is to go back to part-time if not get a new job entirely, and I'm just saving as much as I can for now.

The closest I've found to a solution is that I started streaming on Twitch almost a year and a half ago. It's when I feel happiest because it kind of allows me to zone out and put myself in a world separate from the shitty working life that I'm actually in. and is also pretty much my only contact with people outside of work and close family. Not saying this is the answer but maybe it'll help you think of something you might find helpful."
