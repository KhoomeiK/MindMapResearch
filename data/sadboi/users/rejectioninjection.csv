While plucking my eyebrows, looking closer in the mirror, I discover small eyebrow hairs down toward my lash line. So I'm plucking them slowly moving downwards, getting a bit frustrated with how hairy my face apparently is. Until I'm plucking a few lashes that are out of place... 

THEN I discover a hair. It's ON my eyeball. So I'm kind of freaked out about there being a hair there, but also lazer focused about plucking hairs, so I go to pluck it with my tweezers. When I pull it out these sort of roots, like tree roots but grows thin slimy sausagy tentacle type things follow. So I'm pulling this shit out of my actual eyeball and I'm scared as shit and freaking out and sick to my stomach. And then I wake up.

I do understand the compulsion to check your ex's social media, but I would absolutely recommend you unfollow him everywhere (his family and friends as well). It's not about being bitter and punishing him, it's about you giving yourself room to heal and grow. 

I'm sorry that your friends isolate, effectively isolating you. I'm guilty of that myself.. I don't really know what to do about that. But I do think it's great that you posted here, maybe you find some of the support that you're lacking in your friendships. 

Other than that, I think meditation can help you. It's the first thing that popped into my head while I read your post. I don't really use it as much as I ""should"", but I really like Headspace. Be gentle, patient, and understanding with yourself. 

Good luck!"
