relationship_advice,fqgshzy,t1_fqgry9r,1589355676.0,"I wish it was much easier to get perspective and obviously that comes from time and experience with someone. As for your comment on what I should say, that’s brilliant and I’ll probably say something similar, the whole “don’t copy my homework change a few things” scheme. But it’s great. The other night we were chatting and I *love* working with my hands and so I have Lego and Gundam and I was just pulling them into view and she was loving seeing what I was passionate about and I was so stoked to see that she didn’t think my hobbies were meaningless or silly or childish, but she thought they were actually interesting. I should sleep. Thank you for all your help :)"
AmItheAsshole,fqgrjyz,t3_gig1ij,1589354783.0,"NTA. My sister has a peanut allergy and I think I’ll call her peanut tomorrow just to see her reaction. In other news, if my sister did that I would laugh at her and tell her to grow up, but I am a dignified asshole brother."
relationship_advice,fqgr99m,t1_fqgqnns,1589354511.0,"We both have thoroughly expressed how much we enjoy talking and we have both established common interest in each other, but we’re saying talking just because of all the shit that’s going on and that relationships can get stressful and right now that’s 0% what either of us need right now.

Next time we talk (which will probably be tomorrow), I think I’ll ask her about the communication stuff, because that’s honestly an irrational fear of mine, no not getting hit by a car or dying, no it’s losing someone due to me being too chatty (would clingy apply to this?).

I’ve forgotten what this feeling is like through meaningless relationships from Tinder, this feels nice and I can’t get her out of my head, not that I mind that."

AmItheAsshole,fq87gap,t3_gh6p60,1589160041.0,"YTA. Straight up, get out of here with your “well my body hurts so she can deal with some hand pain” excuse, that’s the most obnoxious thing I’ve heard all day and I’ve been browsing Reddit for a few hours now. I do art as well and it hurts your hand and cramps it up. Don’t be so controlling as to try to tell her what she can and can’t buy just because “she’s young and doesn’t have arthritis”. She might not now but just you wait. Worry about yourself, if she’s buying it on your dime I get it you don’t care about how she feels, but don’t try to stop her from buying what she wants."
AmItheAsshole,fq86r5n,t3_gh5te6,1589159636.0,"NAH, his music is definitely concerning and the fact he used to be a dealer isn’t good if she used to have issues, but she’s grown up and she made a decision. I’d say meet him and see how he’s like, worst case is you talk with her about it."

The fact that they ordered something that expensive on your tab and expected you to pay is hilarity. Don’t offer that to them again."
AmItheAsshole,fq85vdn,t3_gh5cvf,1589159122.0,"NTA, as a 21 year old dude, I can tell you I eat a lot, and had a hell of an appetite at 17. I wasn’t really thin but I wasn’t the thickest dude around and I would eat food left and right. The young ones won’t eat it all and all they’ll accomplish is making bitten leftovers they won’t want because “it’s old food”. Smh little man old food is what I survive on because of school."
AmItheAsshole,fq85d2r,t3_gh86e3,1589158826.0,"NTA, she’s trying to both keep the money and the pride, acting like she’s helping out so much. She shouldn’t have run to your father bitching to him like that because he of all people knows the truth. She’s being TA because she’s trying to make herself look better in front of her peers when they don’t know the truth."
AmItheAsshole,fq84k1d,t3_gh5s04,1589158366.0,"NTA. Like everyone is saying, your ex-husband is trying to set a good example for the kids. Unless the card was saying things like “I want to see you again” or things of that nature, then your ex-boyfriend shouldn’t have blown up. Your ex-husband was just being civil and being kind."
AmItheAsshole,fq83y8w,t3_gh7yfh,1589158009.0,"NTA. He not only was being a racist piece of shit but got his boyfriends involved calling you, of all things, a n****r. Super unprofessional and immature. The club should have banned every one of them on the spot. It’s pathetic. Keep doing what you love, even if some battles didn’t have black troops (or at least didn’t report it) doesn’t mean you can’t join in anyway. Fuck them, they’re rat shit."

Vent,fi1djy9,t1_fi1cpv4,1582055606.0,"That’s what I’m assuming, I’m guessing my roommate doesn’t care either since every girl he’s brought into the room have been more into me and I always make a point to him that I’m not going to talk to them unless they’re just trying to be friends, and even then keeping it to a minimum. The most recent girl came in and recognized me from Tinder and was critiquing his account and using mine as an example. I try to just stay in my own zone which is usually the living room since he’s always in the room working and I don’t want to bother him."
Vent,fi1bxpn,t1_fi1b003,1582054691.0,"Like if it was just me in the room and they said that haha no problem just jokes I’d serve them straight back.  It in front of my new girlfriend? Fuck no. Another friend of mine thinks it might be jealousy on RF’s part and I could see it because RF was a little flirty with me in the past but as R was into her I backed off. RF also sent me a Happy Valentine’s Day text which I kind of thought was odd at first as we barely talk but I ended up chalking it up to her kind of being into me, but I had a date with my now girlfriend that night so I kind of brushed it off and was just playing friendly. So I don’t know, but I’m mad at my roommate because that was some immature shit and he definitely didn’t help his situation. I’ve said maybe a sentence to him today. All in all, 1/10, super uncomfortable and embarrassing, only slightly funny but mostly annoying."
