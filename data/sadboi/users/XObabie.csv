JUSTNOMIL,f6utj78,t3_dt2ztt,1573168339.0,"what the actual fuck?!? my suggestion, although it might not actually work, is to act like you're going to agree to this bullshit and have them come to the doctor with you. and then surprise, get to the doctor's appointment where he promptly gives them a lecture about the dangers of doing so and possibly suggests that your FSIL gets some attention from a behavioral health specialist ASAP. i saw that another commenter mentioned that a doctor would never induce labor pre-term.

for example, just invite her along to one of your routine appointments and give her the impression that you want her there while talking to the doctor about induction options. then when you get there, tell the doctor, in front of her, that she has been repeatedly asking you to have your baby A MONTH EARLY because she can't handle the trigger or whatever. then if she doesn't throw a fit and storm out of the room, she will have to hear the doctor explain how unsafe that is for the child. it will also be on the doctor's record.

i don't know if that's actually a good idea or not and it may be better to just go NC again, but it came to my brain so i typed it. good lord. i'm sorry you're dealing with this."

AmItheAsshole,f6k6kwj,t1_f6ig0xq,1572906090.0,">2 of the previous kids are excited about it the other isn't. The other is HOSTILE towards the 2 year old. You make no mention of therapy or similar. Something is wrong. Your kid is not coping with the lifestyle change that has occured here for some underlying reason

it sounds like a clear case of ""I'm not the baby anymore."" all the attention from the parents, grandparents, AND 2 older siblings is now on the new baby. and now the kid is being made to feel like they don't deserve to go to disney world. mom better prepare for a seriously rebellious teenager. i mean, she better prepare to start hearing whatever type of music she hates the most being played LOUD AS SHIT and seeing obstinence like she's never fathomed. WOW

YTA ALL DAY

edit to add: both of the older kids already shared the experience of the excitement of a new baby and kind of already knew how how to help, so they didn't mind volunteering. 3rd kid has no idea what to do, and the older siblings are probably little assholes about how good they are at it when the adults aren't looking. so there's that too

edit again: i forgot they were twins. my bad. scratch that edit. but even still, with twins, you don't know the dynamic. a friend of mine has twins and one of them was born later in the day and refers to herself as the younger one. whatever"

She may have detected that you have done this before and didn't want to be upfront about it. I don't know. I wasn't there. I don't know what you do. Have you done it before? It doesn't make you an asshole, but it probably triggered some feelings of being a notch on your belt and she HAD to nip it in the bud for her own sanity. She didn't have to call you disgusting but I stick by my judgement. She was disgusted and was honest about it. Would you rather she have stayed and pretended like she was cool with it? Or are you judging her for how she feels without knowing why she feels that way? THAT would make you an asshole."

Sometimes if you’re in a good situation but something else is bugging you, you won’t feel like you even deserve to be in such a good situation. And in that case thinking about how good you have it, although intended to lift spirits, can actually make you feel worse. Like, it’s really nice to have something good that you can count on, but if you feel like you don’t deserve it, you can’t really enjoy it.

high school: broke my kneecap and didn't get it xrayed until months later. the technician said something about getting xrays immediately and not waiting until months later. i thought she was talking to me, but in hindsight i'm pretty sure that was directed at my mom. she seemed pretty annoyed.

college: told her i think i'm depressed or bipolar or something. ""ain't nothing wrong with you""

fast forward to now, i'm not famous but i've made some pretty neat connections over the years. i have gotten so many compliments on my voice. when i used to street perform, people would write me the the nicest notes about how much they enjoyed my performances (and i was still struggling to hit notes). i could have had a record deal a couple years ago but missed the opportunity because i was having a severe breakdown. i'm now in a position where whenever i decide to put more music out, i have fans who will listen. i'm just trying to find the energy to write again, and even though i haven't become rich and famous (yet), i've made it farther than she or i could have ever imagined. just the fact that multiple people in hollywood enjoyed my music baffles me. i literally couldn't believe it. i dissociated from it because it was just not possible in my mind."
