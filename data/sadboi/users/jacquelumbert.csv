You can really love her, but also dont want a baby. it wouldnt be sustainable to not have one for someone who wants it that bad. Maybe talk about it with her some more, visit relatives/friends who have babies and hear about their experiences. Try to change your mindset if you really want that option, otherwise its better to find a partner who doesnt want kids. Hope this helps a bit. Best of luck."

BorderlinePDisorder,fnyust9,t3_g4p7x9,1587376473.0,"Hi man, it took guts to write all this down, respect. I'm assuming you are a fellow man. Bpd is a sucker, the anger related to it is overwhelming. Makes you insecure, powerless and dependant. Push and pull feelings toward your loved one. 

The only advice I can offer you is get your gf or future partner to understand, once you passed that feeling of insecurity your relationship should feel more stable, as will your moodswings. 

Drugs are short term fullfillment, obviously you know this, still it is tempting to feel like F it all I'm in control of my own downfall. Long term tho, consider those tantrums as an investment towards future happiness. Try to get control of those. 

The headbanging and selfdestructiveness are coping with your inner chaos, trying to externalize it. Consider working out or buying a bag for boxing. It won't feel nearly as relieving tho, and will take some time to make this your aggressiveness outlet.

I wish you the best of luck."
