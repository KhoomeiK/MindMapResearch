bipolar,fqo6vi6,t1_fqnsk2d,1589508789.0,yeah we agreed to stop it i have only been on it for like 1.5 months or so
BipolarReddit,fq7nneo,t3_gh98xq,1589148825.0,some people are lucky and only need meds but most of the time you need therapy too especially to learn how to cope

schizophrenia,fpgfwb5,t3_gd8s69,1588601889.0,"people dislike it because it is, by many studies, found to have the worst metabolistic effects and causes crazy weight gain and has a side effect profile like most antipsychotics that can make you unemotional and stuff. its worth noting that everyone is different and some people might be weight neutral on it and find benefit from it. ive never taken it though."
antidepressants,fpgf9f6,t3_gdalec,1588601515.0,"everyone is different but i found effexor and pristiq (chemically similar, switched to effexor for availability) to be really effective for me"

schizophrenia,fp85qgg,t1_fp7sxn4,1588384212.0,me too. thank you.
antidepressants,fozsvcm,t1_foznwya,1588196272.0,"it makes complete sense and i agree with your concerns. personally i havent had any issues when changing generics but if youd prefer the brand it would be best to file an appeal with your doctor. i think wellbutrin XL has a manufacturers coupon you could apply for too.

edit: repeated myself"

insomnia,foz8o3j,t3_gabzg6,1588186528.0,is it possible that what you are describing is a hypnic jerk ?
schizophrenia,foz7g73,t3_gac9mx,1588185949.0,for sure. just like how antidepressants are prescribed for anxiety and anticonvulsants for bipolar. they have been proven to work for depression and are a good second option for people who dont respond well to traditional antidepressants. for sleep the risks might outweigh the benefits but that really depends on the patient.
schizophrenia,foz70ot,t3_gad45r,1588185746.0,akathisia. its so painful.
bipolar,fow9k21,t1_fow9clp,1588115542.0,"yeah, your health and finances are more important than what she thinks anyway so im glad you can recognise what you want in a therapist. dont stick with her if you dont feel a connection with her."
mentalillness,fow8dof,t1_fow87cy,1588114906.0,good luck to you too !
bipolar,fow7vv4,t3_g9wzb4,1588114645.0,oh yeah the littlest things make me physicallly violent. ive crushed and broken my stuff over little things like my writing not being perfect enough.
mentalillness,fow7kig,t3_g9xbsm,1588114479.0,me too. i suffered from psychotic episodes since childhood and hadnt gotten help until last year. got diagnosed as schizoaffective after a while. getting help was one of the best things ever.
bipolar,fow78tk,t3_g9xiir,1588114309.0,my psychiatrist talks a bit much for my liking but in fairness he is explaining my symptoms and medications i take. my therapist only brings up stories very shortly to relate to me. so i personally would trust your own gut and probably save your money for another therapist.
bipolar,fou9dqy,t3_g9lpzs,1588079419.0,youre not wrong. i have it too. we are equally part of both the schizophrenia and bipolar communities. theres a reason some call it the bipolar spectrum and it definitely isnt just 1 & 2 !
BipolarReddit,fonhoex,t3_g8h3gv,1587919689.0,i was manic and psychotic and i tapered off about 1.5 weeks worth of escitalopram because i didnt trust my psychiatrist anymore since i thought she was out to get me. the withdrawal was bad despite the taper but i got through it.
schizoaffective,fonh5sv,t3_g8c235,1587919401.0,i dont think tripping on meds works. regardless for your safety its not usually advised even in mentally healthy people you need to be in a good headspace to drop acid.
bipolar,foi09h3,t3_g7hyz6,1587776099.0,"hoping this is some sort of mistake

update : it was."
schizoaffective,fof78yr,t3_g74tce,1587728406.0,yes feels like i never sleep sometimes because a dream is just an alternate universe i step into at times

mentalillness,fo7ze8f,t3_g68gwf,1587587177.0,this sounds more like anxiety and DP/DR or dissociation to me. youd ought to find a therapist if you can or do some more research about how to cope with these kinds of things really.
antidepressants,fo7yaaf,t3_g68221,1587586623.0,"theres so many medications out there and youve been on them long enough to know theyre not helping. if you feel like you need medication make sure to write down all the reasons why you want to switch. if you dont want to be on meds anymore thats cool too, but just be cautious and work closely with the doc."

schizophrenia,fo4lj74,t3_g5omc3,1587506601.0,this is actually one reason i dread sleeping because when i wake up i feel like i am entering a different reality again and its all just very painful and confusing to process. in my dreams i tend to sleep and wake up in the same universe so when i actually wake up i feel really confused.
bipolar,fo4l0mb,t3_g5nh79,1587506341.0,looking good... our fridge and pantry is a huge mess.
bipolar,fo3o7ka,t1_fo3fcl4,1587490195.0,"i have been on two medications that are commonly abused in the past , just take them as prescribed and it will not be a problem. if you notice the klonopin is not working do NOT start taking more , just tell your doctor instead because taking more and more is how you fall down the addiction rabbithole."
schizophrenia,fo3h3h1,t3_g5hqbr,1587486795.0,sometimes its obvious but most of the time idk.

bipolar,fo35957,t1_fo31ke7,1587480794.0,"i think im gonna try to stabilise again and then ask to be tested , i really worry about triggering mania."

bipolar,fo2ddsu,t3_g5b4cp,1587458129.0,i have a hard time telling too BUT i think if the meds are working my thoughts arent going fast and im not moving around everywhere and dont feel on top of the world i guess ? i just feel really... normal and not crazy feeling
Psychosis,fo19km4,t3_g4zaq2,1587428555.0,ohh yes i have embarrassed myself so much.....hate to think about it
BipolarReddit,fo19gzm,t3_g54hc4,1587428495.0,"yeah, i took it before bed time but the intensity of the sleepiness lowered after a bit"
antidepressants,fo10yuu,t1_fo0ulfr,1587423568.0,"i understand that, and i really recommend therapy if you dont already go, you can tell your therapist about how medication makes you feel and decide if its really for you and make a plan on how you can cope with finding the right med. sometimes people feel better with therapy alone too."
antidepressants,fo0th5x,t3_g51z1t,1587419455.0,"everyone is different, some medications will make people gain weight and others mighy be weight neutral, or even make people lose weight. i agree medication can be scary or exhausting but i encourage you to keep trying , you dont have to force yourself to like the meds youre on since theres a lot of them to try."
schizophrenia,fo0s6hc,t3_g4z1j2,1587418774.0,"this is a really great page on how to understand and help someone with schizophrenia, it pretty much sums up all the basic things i want people to know about it.

BipolarReddit,fo0rdoi,t3_g4zm1k,1587418351.0,"i like to give people advice about medication and mental illness / disorders but i express that it is my experience only and that a doctor can help them best , if they didnt get that then id be frustrated"
schizophrenia,fnwwfay,t3_g4cq1c,1587326780.0,"i mean to be schizophrenic i think you at least need to be delusional ? some people have very subtle delusions that only professionals would notice , or like they hallucinate but they have no insight. it might take longer for them to get diagnosed. but schizophrenics also have negative and depressive symptoms and might try to get help with those which is where a doctor might realise the person has schizophrenia."
schizophrenia,fnwurp5,t3_g4dqgr,1587325850.0,whenever someone talks bad about mentally ill people i immediately start fuming and correcting them. i really should save my energy but it really frustrates me how easily people subscribe to the idea that we are all violent.

BipolarReddit,fnv023a,t3_g41mie,1587275944.0,abilify made me feel this way... i hope it ends for you soon. just remembering the feeling is terrible.
bipolar,fnuzw2o,t3_g41ntq,1587275798.0,"technically, everyone depends on neurotransmitters to function, you just need the medication to give your brain a boost. my meds are just like a meal to me, they give me what i need to live, and i easily take them by leaving them on my bedside in a weekly labelled pill organiser every morning and every night.

i have an alarm for morning medication set for every single day and an alarm for night medication set for every night. i take them everyday because i have been on meds that work, even though it takes a while to find the right combination."
antidepressants,fnuyyx6,t3_g4204j,1587275006.0,yeah i used to never dream and ever since i started taking meds i can now expect to have some WEIRD/BAD dreams every single night without fail. i dont really know how to stop them but if you dont go to therapy you can try asking for meds that are known to help with nightmares.
bipolar2,fnreg03,t3_g3halx,1587186518.0,i feel you lately. really proud that you took precautions. *hugs*
antidepressants,fnq2twb,t3_g3a33j,1587156617.0,"i stopped lexapro cold turkey after taking it about roughly the same amount of time. everyone is different but i was lucky my withdrawal was not totally severe. every time i moved my body i got minor vertigo and occassional brain zaps when i moved my eyes and head. i think taking medical marijuana is a really good idea, but regardless itll take at least a month for the side effects to dissipate. just hang in there basically - if you still have your meds keep cutting them in half every few days til theyre gone. take steamy baths and migraine pills for pain relief. you got this."
antidepressants,fnq02n5,t3_g39i5p,1587155145.0,this is really cool. praying that it stays this way for you.

bipolar2,f6131vs,t3_dq7ngg,1572631950.0,"my psychiatrist says its ideal to be on the least amount of medications possible, he doesnt want to pile more and more medications onto me for little side effects and would rather try entirely new medications first, which i am thankful for. *however* he also recognises when its necessary to add a second or third medication - i clearly needed an antidepressant with my antipsychotic medication, and sometimes he gives me anxiolytics and insomnia meds for my episodes of unrest. so i dont think her philosphy is entirely wrong but its clear you need to try some other combinations."
