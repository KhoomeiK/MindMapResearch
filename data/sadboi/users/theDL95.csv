AskWomen,fdktsl3,t1_fdki20f,1578511004.0,Yea I'm coming to realize this myself. That was during my service in the Army too which already has a stigma for not that great mental health service. I was already out of the Army once I figured it out. I went a whole year being diagnosed..
AskWomen,fdkfrq7,t3_elt1q1,1578502932.0,"My therapist sent me to get tested for different kinds of mental illnesses. I was diagnosed ADHD and Borderline personality. She never told me, I read it in my medical records myself and got it confirmed by another psychiatrist."
Veterans,fdh85uh,t1_fdexusa,1578417457.0,"What did you do in the military? My husband and I were in aviation so there were a lot of job opportunities all over the place, plus he alone has like 14 years experience in avionics. We had to move to st. Louis immediately following our separation from the Army cause there was nothing available at the time. We recently recently moved back down here because family/kids are here and we simply love texas. My point is, there might not be anything now but eventually what youre looking for might open up."
Veterans,fcxwn1k,t3_ejc97u,1578071544.0,"Texas
Pros: honestly texas is just huge and has a lot of job opportunities. Even more so theres a lot of companies that hire veterans here.  Most areas are not super expensive as far as rent. We are trying to use our VA loan to buy a 5 acre lot with a 5 bedroom for less than 300k. We are in the corpus Christi area. 
The va hospitals here are pretty good too. 
Lots to do in regards to outdoor activities and even museums and what not. 

Cons: the state is big, so relocating for us was hard. Its becoming more and more crowded. It gets pretty hot, humid where we are."

I know not knowing what you wanna do in life is common but I'm 24 just got out of the army, I'm a mom, and I just suddenly stopped doing classes cause I dont know what I want.

VeteransBenefits,fbdntj3,t1_fbcjzfo,1576767169.0,"They never told me my diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. I didn't know till I read my medical record with a compensation doctor for something unrelated... I was like wow what the fuck... How could they never tell me. Also didn't tell me i have ADHD. Like I could've been in treatment this whole time. So I went a whole year being diagnosed during my service but didn't find out till a month ago. 

I do know that if you have personality/mood disorders prior to service or that are not service related you can STILL get compensation if you have direct evidence that your time in service aggravated your condition. Which I believe is how I got my 70% for BH reasons alone and 80%  overall.

Edit: I didn't read everything and realize people already brought up my point... Guess I'm just an example of a generous compensation doctor with a fucked up medical history."
VeteransBenefits,fbchnrh,t3_ecme0s,1576724130.0,I got 70% for behavioral health alone... But I had a decent paper trail and was hospitalized during my service for it. Idk how they even rate it.. Definitely didn't expect to get anything for that.
BorderlinePDisorder,fbc89rd,t1_fbblm8a,1576718049.0,Yeah im so discouraged by doctors at this point with BPD... They didnt even tell me I had it at first I had to read my medical record from my time in the army to even see I had it.
BorderlinePDisorder,fbc83xq,t1_fbatwln,1576717940.0,I get them when highly stressed. I get into a sort of paranoid state and just loss control mentally it seems like.

I too get voices and was diagnosed borderline and adhd. But when I tried to explain that I did have voices they kinda seemed like they didnt believe me. I do believe I have BPD cause I fit the criteria perfectly.... Except the voices part which I dont understand either"

I'm sorry you had to go through that with your family though. I was hospitalized for attempting suicide and my family acted so nonchalant about it. I have a hard time explaining to people my feelings even more now because of this."
BorderlinePDisorder,f94hiur,t1_f8wcaf6,1575088477.0,It's disturbing how toxic our own families can be. If they would just listen and take the time to understand what you're going through.

I was reading my medical files from my time in the service when I saw my test result entries about that and having ADHD. They told me it was adjustment disorder and that it would pass.. Now that I have read this I plan to get a second opinion to make sure since they didnt want to tell me maybe it's something else. I believe I do have it and now that I know its relieving to have an idea of what it is that makes me behave the ways I do and get the treatment I need."
