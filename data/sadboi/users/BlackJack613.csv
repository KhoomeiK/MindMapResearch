Pinterest is a good source for recipes as they usually include some really good, appetizing photos to inspire you. 

Becoming vegetarian doesn't have to be a huge change, you can still eat junk food, you can change some of your favourite dishes so that only the protein (and possibly some flavourings) are different. The easier the switch is the more likely most people stick with it longer term :)"

About the salt water softeners I've always been told that the salt bonds to the calcium in a way to create a new molecule that we don't taste. The caveat being that the new molecule is more prone to crystallizing in our kidneys. I'm likely wrong about that though, that's all second hand info"
