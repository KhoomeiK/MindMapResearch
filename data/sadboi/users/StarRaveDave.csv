Albuquerque,fi3xmrh,t3_f65u87,1582129798.0,I see this a lot as well and it genuinely terrifies me.
assholedesign,fi3146q,t1_fi2ys7r,1582096255.0,"I definitely agree with reason 1. But sterility in the healthcare field, especially when it comes to IV injections, is sort of a double edged sword. You have to ask yourself here: ""Would I rather have the nurse poke a patients line once and minimize the risk for infection? or Would I rather have the nurse poke the line multiple times and increase the chance for infection?"" Also, a majority of drugs have overfill because it is difficult to obtain every single drop. This also applies to syringes and bags. It is much easier to obtain the most fluid out of a syringe with no air inside as opposed to a IV piggyback. I am all for patient safety and aseptic technique; I have never had a syringe that went above 60 mL pop out or leak on me. For number 2 ( I do not know if this is the same all around, but could just be at the hospital I work at) BD manages 90% of our products from machines to the Sodium Chloride bags. This includes empty via flex bags and all syringes. So if BD has a product on backorder, the plan would be to borrow supplies from another local hospital. In my opinion, the hospital needs to utilize more providers for that scenario. And this sort of applies to number 3 as well. BD provides us with 50 mL mini bags of Sodium chloride, Dextrose and 50% Dextrose prefill syringes/ Sodium Bicarb. Again, I do not know how much other hospitals depend on BD, but it seems to me as a huge provider with a huge lead in the industry would have an impactful footprint. A scenario I run into a lot is the Bicarb and D 50 syringes. Once they go on backorder no other location that carries the drug will even send you some to borrow. It gets really bad to a point where it does have a clinical impact and I see it across my hospital. I brought this to my lead supervisors attention back in November and she did her best to provide the company with feedback. (BD received our feedback today)  Just like some people mention BD does enjoy feedback and will provide these concerns within their audits. The audits are submitted to the FDA and taken note of. Overall, I can see justification but found it humorous the syringe was the same shape and size with just a pinch less of ink. Perspective and input is key to designing these products for the best results. So please take not that I am only one healthcare worker and that some may agree or disagree."
assholedesign,fi2yck1,t1_fi2xysx,1582093179.0,"I appreciate the input. I work with the syringes on a daily and have never had an issue drawing the bigger syringes back to 60 mL. Even if the plunger goes past 60, it has never popped off on me. I can see the company willing to sacrifice ink over the additional resources put into manufacturing a bigger end  to prevent the plunger from escaping its port."
assholedesign,fi2pbmd,t1_fi2ozzs,1582085313.0,"Ironically, when the syringe is fully to at least 50 mL and dropped, the opposite end luer to luer cap will come off and it gets wasted due to the exposure to a non sterile environment. It takes quite a bit of force to pull the plunger all they way back and completely pull it apart."
assholedesign,fi2m5xl,t1_fi2h4qg,1582083023.0,"It is definitely an increase in work load when most pediatric patients dosing can fit into 60 or at most 120 mL for a bag. But boy does it get ridiculous to have to open another 10 or 20 mL syringe for increments you used to have and waste much more plastic per dose. For my job, we do patient specific doses. If we did batching we would be throwing away majority of the drugs. I guess either way is wasteful. Bottom line here is how the syringe is the same size but the manufacture cut back on the ink."
assholedesign,fi2h6mz,t1_fi2ehk4,1582079672.0,"They are made by the same manufacturer. As someone who works on a pediatric unit, pumps for syringes are easier to set up for nurses and faster for ICU patients as opposed to sticking an IV piggyback and hanging it. Syringes also allow the pumps to push fluid at a much smaller rate as opposed to a bag (which is definitely needed for babies). While the dosing and drug strengthens vary to provide the proper dose for treatment in a child. Majority of the time the drug is usually diluted and the diluent takes up anywhere from 40 to 50 mL or of the syringe. Leaving the rest of the 10 mL for drug or more diluent if needed."
