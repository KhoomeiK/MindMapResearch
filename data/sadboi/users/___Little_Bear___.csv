I should have noted that over the 4 weeks I was out of the office for almost 2 weeks for the holidays so I was emailing from home hoping shed have an update as she was the only one at the office and I figured shed have some spare time. 

But yes, in hindsight I probably should have cc'd HR in the first or second ""check in"" email. 


I did end up sending my CV to HR this week. Unfortunately it must be done through my boss. HR must have reached out to her because when I got into the office this morning I had a very short ""apology"" for my CV ""getting held up in her cue"" and she had edits for me before she could turn it in.
