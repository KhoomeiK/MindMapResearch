I went through a point where I actually made a list of what was getting to me in sections of aking me unhappy, uncomfortable or just what I wanted to get out of life.

After that I wrote down what I could do about it and tracked it. This only works for future and present things though. When dealing with past things is where things... this is where I get a bit bad as I still have a lot of emotional scaring from family things, past relationships and things I know I could have done better to make better situations now. Not only that but currently I've been struggling with a few things which cannot be changed or really even effect the future... they just get to me a little bit.
