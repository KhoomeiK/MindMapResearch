However, one chilling fact is that the effects of the dimensions causes a person to decay in an extremely low rate while still alive. Throughout the time of almost 6 years, Dr. Scranton records himself and his experience. The horrifying thing is that his body slowly starts to come apart, and he is driven into madness. Afterwards, he was able to return back, but his body has mostly disintegrated. There are some lengthy logs you can read.
