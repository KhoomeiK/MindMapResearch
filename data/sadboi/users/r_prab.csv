AskReddit,fdas6ud,t3_ekcgua,1578249420.0,"Well I tried for a few Months and it was worth it. I actually read their terms in detail to be sure i didn't screw up with anything. They state that you should unsubscribe a certain number of days before the free trial ends. In my case it was two days before the free week would get over. But during the trial I was really hooked. The 4K quality was just killer. And the full length features were delight to watch. I enjoy adult movies like mainstream films. I notice the plot, the lights, camera angles, the backdrops, the set up and all that. I loved that they had full length films from almost all the big production houses. It helped me discover a lot of interesting production houses. This is a great advantage. You don't need to subscribe to multiple sites when you have PHP. Additionally,  you can download the videos,  pictures, and get behind the scenes materials. There are tons of full legth DVDs and more awesome content than we see on the non subscription version of the website. Vist pornhubselect.com, where they have hosted high quality edited videos from PHP and can be accessed for free."
grammar,fd9c3l8,t3_ekb3sr,1578231364.0,"I am currently studying Grammar Basics, so I can help. I am following Wren and Martin, and this is what the rule says: A pronoun directly after 'than' or 'as' is usually in the Objective form (me, him, her, us, them) unless there is a verb after it. If a verb follows it, the Nominative form (I, he, she, we, they) is used.

You dance better than I do.

After 'than' there is a verb 'do'
So pronoun will be in Nominative form : I 

If there was no verb after 'than', it will take the Objective form.

You dance better than me. 

More examples:

He is taller than me.
He is taller than I am. (The verb 'am' is there after 'than')

Examples using 'as' :

I sing as good as her. 
I sing as good as she does. 

The rival team played as aggresivly as us. 
The rivel team played as aggresivly as we did. 

Got it? Try this:

We scored as many goals as ______? (they/them)"
IWantToLearn,fd97f25,t3_ekaimr,1578229529.0,"I sticked to finding works that involved reading and writing. All my life, i have been  a keen reader and writer (writing in my diary and sometimes on blog) I am socially withdrawn and often spend weekends with myself reading or writing. While I was in college, i worked on creating a proper blog for myself and grew my network by visiting other bloggers who wrote on similar subject as I do. When i was applying for jobs, I was looking at job profiles that required reading and writing skills (Roles like: Marketing Communication, Content Curator, Content Specialist, etc.) I realised that me already having a blog gave me a lot of mileage. I could talk about all the steps I took to create it, the challenges I faced and the results I achieved as a blogger. These helped me create an identity as a passionate writer and reader. I got a job at a company that wanted someone to scale up their content volume. I think even if we know something and are passionate about it, it is important to spend time to create something that can be showcased in the interviews.  While I created my proper blog more out of passion, the learnings helped me position myself more concretely in front of the interviewer as a doer than just a thinker."

IWantToLearn,fd8pad7,t3_ek5hso,1578221318.0,"I have been struggling with the same. I decided to move my bed from tv room to the other room where there are no screens but only books. Earlier, I would watch tv till late night. I have also decided to take a shower before sleeping. This is an experiment. I have felt that when i struggle to sleep, my mind seems too activated. Shower cools down my mind, so decided to add that to my schedule to see if it can help my mind stay calm and  get sleep sooner. Also, I think a shower will create a psychological gap between the rest of the day and the sleep. After shower, all I want to allow myself is a book or a diary. No smartphone or tv."
