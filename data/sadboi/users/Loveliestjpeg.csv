Previous - gives them a good idea of what you had & lets them calculate what they feel is a reasonable upgrade for your new salary in terms of your job scope, experience, and etc

Expected - They see how much you want to determine whether you‚Äôre a reasonable person or not (too high > you‚Äôre probably someone who is going to be a pain in the butt for them in the company)

singapore,fq98e3z,t3_ghjz36,1589189319.0,"I‚Äôm going to start off by saying, this will be a biased opinion. I‚Äôm not going to give you the pros and cons of both. I will be directly encouraging you to go for B.

Why? Have you ever worked part time jobs before (i skimmed your post so idk)? It‚Äôs jobs you work to earn money that you can spend. That‚Äôs the same concept as A. Now, do you remember how you felt during that job? Your colleagues might be great of course, and the job might be decent. But more often than not, wasn‚Äôt it just nothing but drudgery? Something that you endured just to get spending money?

Imagine working that job for the rest of your life. ‚ÄúBut earn more then can retire faster then won‚Äôt be so long‚Äù, ok, but how long will that take? I‚Äôm still super young so i don‚Äôt know how earning & retiring early works, but i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not like just a 5 year thing or anything. And even just 5 years in a job that you‚Äôre only relatively interested in, does that not sound super fking sian? Doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot but just imagine this quarantine period. It‚Äôs already felt like a lifetime (i know there‚Äôs a difference between CB period & normal daily life but i‚Äôm just making a point with a loose example) for most people, and it‚Äôs only been 1 & a half months so far. Multiply that by 40x and that‚Äôs 5 years. 40x of endless lifetimes just so that you can ‚Äúenjoy in the future‚Äù. 

I am aware this is definitely not everyone‚Äôs mindset, nor is it ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù. I know that it won‚Äôt work for everyone, and that A will work better for half the population. And there‚Äôs also the whole issue of struggling with living expenses if you go for B, sacrificing your pennies for something you love. I‚Äòm just asking you to give a bit of thought for B.

Don‚Äôt go to work everyday hating life. If you choose path B, & enjoy your work, you will keep learning and keep growing as a person. You‚Äôll gain loads of experience and memories doing something you love. I‚Äôm not saying that A means more money less enjoyment or that B means more enjoyment less money. There‚Äôll can be a compromise between both and you can find it. My vote is for you to follow what your heart says, and live life for what it‚Äôs worth."

Don‚Äôt bother to argue with these kind of people because they will not listen to random strangers on the street (people with no power). They‚Äôre used to getting their own way.
