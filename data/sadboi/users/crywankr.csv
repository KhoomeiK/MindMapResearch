depression,flrlsfg,t3_fqq0l0,1585422841.0,hey. i feel you. suicide isnt the answer and i know it sounds so dumb and repetetive but ive been there and been suicidal. listen things arent permanent. pain isnt either. and the virus. its all gonna take time but itll get much better and youll be able to look back at these moments and think how glad you are to be alive. remember that everything is temporary. death is permanent. youll have happy moments and bad ones. just keep going until you get to the good parts of life. its the only reason im alive is cause i know eventually ill be happy. at some point.  just keep going. everyone here believes in you
