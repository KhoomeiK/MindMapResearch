Sorry for not answering earlier, I don't really use Reddit that much hahaha. Everything went kinda okie dokie in the end, so that's that. My relatiionship with my ex got better so that's another positive point. 

Thanks for taking the time to reply to my post, you are a legend. <3

Are you doing ok?

depression,f1kdgej,t3_d9mw6y,1569534481.0,"Shout, sing, compose, write. Let everything go away, no matter the way.  Misery is a shadow that traps us, but damn it are we stronger than that god damn shadow. The fact you feel miserable means you are mature enough to realize and embrace misery in some way, so it is your fight to confront it.

I don't know your case or problems, but I do know that you are gonna be one hell of a fighter, maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow, but I do know you'll be an absolute beat full of new achievements in no time. Accept those feelings and learn from them, analyze how you feel, grow from it.

Good luck and take care m8, I do have faith in you <3."
depression,f1kc8uh,t1_f1hhnf3,1569534140.0,"You're still here m8, so that means you've been able to keep going 'til now. I'd say that is a sign of strength. If you do end up reaching your breaking point just stop for a second and think. Clear your mind even if it's just for a bit and realize what your individual problems and their solutions are. There is no problem without solution, and if you think you've found one that does not have one, well... you create the solution that makes you happier.

Go get'em m8, we get punched all the time, but oh hell do we punch back.

Good luck and take care m8, <3"

Please try, you are a wonderful person and I'd love to know that you are doing better.

Thanks for the comment (which wasn't long don't worry, those are the best) and take care, m8.

depression,eqjwa2y,t3_byomsk,1560112330.0,"So what if you fuck it up, m8? Everyone fucks something up in their lives, absolutely everyone. There is not a single person who hasn't screwed something up, and I'm sure as hell (I could actually bet you a brownie right here, right now) that there will never be one.

Try new things, be impressed with what they could turn into, learn from them, appreciate them. If you've uploaded this post that must mean you have lot of ideas and projects in mind. Therefore I can tell you must be highly talented, at least in the psychological side of things (remember that psychological and practical skills go together a lot of times).

Try to talk to a friend or family member about it. Try things with them, feel comfortable doing it so too!

Everybody has great potential, and you, my friend, are no exception.

Please think about it and realize you are absolutely wonderful and fucking capable of everything you propose to yourself.

Take good care m8,

Doomers,eqhomih,t1_eqgwipf,1560065887.0,"Oh dude, that's bullshit. I get a bit anxie whenever things don't really go the way I want, but with people I kind of feel relaxed. I can't relate to being autistic since I haven't been diagnosed with it, but I'm sure you can go through it and get more social.

Just keep trying, push yourself just a bit further into conversations and social circles everytime, just a little bit. You'll see how step by step you'll beat anxiety and be the soul of every party or social gathering in no time.

Sometimes shit gets difficult, I know, but I believe in you.

Take good care for today m8,

Please post about your progress, I'd love to see that you are doing fine.

Take good care of yourself and send the best of lucks to your mother in her battle against anxiety from me too! (even if the fact that a stranger in the Internet is doing so is kind of weird... sorry xD).

Good luck!

As you said yourself, she is one of your favourite people in the worlds. That must mean she takes good care of you and loves you, so she didn't want to hurt you at all, I'm sure of that!

Also, PLEASE remember that in the heat of the moment people say things that they don't want to. You said yourself she got frustrated. I'm not defending at all the message she sent, but try to talk things out about it with her. You'll understand each other and forget about this incident. She does love you and she absolutely didn't want to hurt you in any way possible.

You are good, loved and brave for actually keep thinking about it and trying to rationalize it.

depression,eqgod9l,t3_bycijd,1560039667.0,"Nah m8, you ain't stupid, I can already tell you that. Being able to have this autorealization is already a sign of emotional intelligence. Besides, who tells you that your intelligence resides in memory or grammar? Maybe you are a great comedian, a great artist, a great singer or simply a great person. Don't forget that you are you. We are all massive fuckups after all, it's just that other people appear to be it more than others because society values some aspects of ourselves more than others (unironically, ""we live in a fucking society"").

Don't forget there are people out there who'd love to see you happy and understand you are extremely valuable.

Doomers,eqgmf2o,t1_epnwnxg,1560038675.0,"I'm kind of a weird person in that sense. I love both socializing with people face to face and isolating myself. I think I've found the perfect balance between those two worlds, my social self and my personal self. They've bond with each other pretty well and that helps me know when I need some ""me time"". This balance helps me a lot and even if I know everything's kind of worthless, I always have that point of reference to hold on.
