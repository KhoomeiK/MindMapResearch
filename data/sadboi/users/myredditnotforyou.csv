dogs,foioqtp,t3_furbyl,1587792297.0,Honestly my dog has more toys than most kids. He is too small to destroy them but he has a toy a hand puppet that is a dog that he will bring to you when he is angry to take out his aggression. It‚Äôs adorable and then I take him to the park he always feels better after that. But I get him stuffed animals that we call ‚Äúhis bitches‚Äù because he jumps them. He humps them for a day and then he is done but a couple have lasted weeks don‚Äôt know why he liked them. Also he has like 10 toys that are his ‚Äúgo to toys‚Äù as in he loves them and will play with them whenever we engage in them. Stop getting him stuffed toys though. Look in the cat section online and children‚Äôs toys they actually make GREAT dog toys. And they sell light up toys and indestructible toys. All kinds. I also make shift the toys I buy him like tie rope or socks to it so he can fling it around. He‚Äôs spoiled.
relationship_advice,fmt7lfn,t3_fx5co0,1586368141.0,That is hilarious. My husband has ADHD and has been taking adderall for it sense the third grade he is 34 now. And yes he needs it because you can tell when he hasn‚Äôt been taking it. He turns into a 5 year old with the attention span of a dog surrounded by new toys and treats. He needs it to focus and calm down his brain doesn‚Äôt work normal and just can‚Äôt otherwise. Anyway about your on again off again boyfriend of ten years we‚Äôll he‚Äôs your choice. Ask yourself is this something I want forever? You don‚Äôt seem happy and if you both were happy you wouldn‚Äôt break up all the time. Do you see yourself getting married to him? Do you want to get married to anyone at all in the future? What are YOU willing to put up with? What are you willing to compromise? Remember relationships are compromise but just don‚Äôt compromise who you are. Where do you draw the line? Where do you want this to lead and where is it realistically leading to? How do you get the relationship off of the corse you don‚Äôt like and on to the course you do and is it even worth it?These are questions you have to be willing to ask yourself and answer honestly. Do you like taking care of an unemployed man child? You said you didn‚Äôt want kids but in my opinion it sounds like you already have one. Would you rather be alone and lonely or with someone and lonely. It sucks to be in a relationship and not have a team player. Maybe go threw couples therapy. Try not cleaning the house for a month and let him be able to see with his own eyes everything you actually do. You have allowed this behavior for ten years. You can try your best to change it now or complain forever. Oh and I don‚Äôt care if he calls us hoes I‚Äôm not 12 it doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings.

Anyway.. 
I understand you pain oh so well. I was abandoned by my mother at age 11 and didn‚Äôt meet my dad until I was 19. My brothers and my sister in law and friends raised me. It hurt sooo bad to know that a drug means more to your mother than you ever will. But that‚Äôs not your case. You are not being abandoned you will still get to see them talk to them and everything. And hey you are going to have your very mature sister taking care of you! Plus honestly how is that going to look on a college application? AMAZING! Think of the good. I know it‚Äôs hard but trust me it would be way worse. At least you won‚Äôt be bouncing around party houses looking for food not even knowing if your parents are alive.

But get the cameras that‚Äôs way there is no he said she said bs. Also remember stimulus checks are coming so use that. If it was me and worse case scenario I would loan the money for the cameras just to get them ASAP and then pay it off with the check or with my paycheck. Praying for those little ones I am so sorry and I hope they are okay now. Also emergency vet is always open after 5.

AskReddit,fmd7ye5,t3_fruade,1585961362.0,I am the only person in the world who had pancreatic cancer and the tumor was not attached to the pancreas. I felt something move when I laid down and put my hand on my stomach. I went to the dr that day where they did an X-ray and ct scan just to real they had no idea what it was. Few weeks later a surgeon took it out and she tolled me that it was the size of my fist and attached to my small intestine and colon and was actually FEEDING off of my colon and rotted out 2 inches that had to be removed during surgery. She said she wanted to cut it open but she wasn‚Äôt allowed to and had to send it off to get tested. It went to LA and then to Oregon somewhere. After about three months my surgeon called me and said that turns out it was the most dangerous pancreatic tumor a person can have and if I would have waited a month it would have spread and I would have died. She said it‚Äôs the first recorded one not attached to the pancreas. I asked if I could name it she said no. But I feel extremely lucky because basically no one lives from that cancer because by the time you feel symptoms it‚Äôs already too late. Sounds made up but I have a huge scare down the center of my stomach to prove it. Every dr I have had finds it either hard to believe or interesting so they always ask for me to release those records to them so I do. Btw that was 8 years ago and have had a few cat scans sense and am completely clear.

They were deviated it really ripped at them. I barely bring her up because it is so hard for them and I would NEVER make a post like that EVER! Why? Because I actually love and respect my family. Even though I am close with them and the kids I would never do that I would feel horrible and dirty. That woman has issues. You should have written on her post ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt post publicly about my dead baby who you‚Äôve never met.‚Äù That‚Äôs what I would have done so EVERYONE can see it and see what a gross piece of shit she is. And your husband should have YOUR back that was your loss more than ANYONE even your husband! You carried and felt that little boy inside you for 7 months! You have the biggest connection to that child not to mention what it does to your hormones after something like that. If I was terrible enough to do something like she did my brother would have called me up himself and scream at me! You are not the bad one. I give your SIL 5 out of 5 and your husband 2 out of 5 assholes for not having your back with such a sensitive subject for you.

relationship_advice,fhmwizo,t3_f3s9zd,1581718951.0,"Honestly I am on her side about the hugging and kissing while making thanksgiving dinner. That shit is stressful and when I am in the zone just leave me be. My husband used to do that stuff and it drove me nuts until one day when he decided to cook for the first time and I came in the kitchen and was just talking then tried to get a kiss out of him and he lost it. Then he stopped and said ‚ÄúOh my god I get it now!‚Äù Then he apologized for all the times he was in my way when I was just trying to focus. I love him so much. Also I have a thing about spit I don‚Äôt share drinks even water but especially milk products. It‚Äôs my thing it‚Äôs weird I know. He understands though and we have no issues with it if anything he likes it because I don‚Äôt take his food or drinks. But we SHARE everything in the fridge we share everything in the house (no toothbrush eww) when you have a family you buy what you will need for the week or month for the family even if it‚Äôs a family of two.
Now the not sharing bills thing is that an insecurity thing like she wants to make sure she‚Äôs okay if you ever leave? I used to be that way until my husband got me to open up that side of me that I have never been able to do and I am greatful and happy because I trust him I trust our relationship and now we only share a bank account and it‚Äôs no big deal.
All the other stuff though I can‚Äôt help you with it just sounds insane. She needs therapy because it doesn‚Äôt sound like she wants to actually be with you or even really understands what it is to be ‚Äútogether‚Äù in a marriage. 
It sounds like she wants you to bend to her will and compromise with everything she wants but she is not willing to do the same for you.
 In marriage there is compromise that‚Äôs life. Just don‚Äôt be willing to compromise yourself as a person."

unpopularopinion,ffpsxjf,t3_eszg5n,1580104528.0,YOU ARE SO RIGHT! Just like Charles Manson he never killed anyone either he just used his freedom of speech to set them free!
FuckYouKaren,ffpsucd,t1_ffdr9zq,1580104435.0,Oh so how many people did you kill at 17? Was it okay because her boyfriend annoyed her? Was his life worth her getting ‚Äúpopular‚Äù. Sounds like you have no soul and no common sense. I hope she kills you next. üî™ or your kids. Lol I hope her kids kill your kids üòÇ And then you say oh it‚Äôs okay. Is that what everyone thought when Charles Manson didn‚Äôt murder anyone? Because he didn‚Äôt. He convinced THEM to do it.
TrueCrime,ffpsg4r,t3_etcurw,1580104038.0,Hey Charles Manson got life and he didn‚Äôt kill anyone so why can‚Äôt she? Oh because she is a girl? Or because she convinced him to take his life over text and phone calls instead of in person? To all of you who hope the best for her I hope she goes after your sons and brothers next.
TrueCrime,ffps6zy,t1_fffz9de,1580103786.0,Yeah she has the same mental disorder as Charles Manson. Poor Manson. He didn‚Äôt kill anyone either.

wedding,fcmkn2n,t3_ehx89u,1577779208.0,I didn‚Äôt do a destination wedding but my brother in-law is and we can‚Äôt make it because of lack of money and current obligations. I was irritated that we had to find out where it was at in the mail but all in all we are not upset but one of the grandmothers is because she can‚Äôt make it either. Basically if you want more family there make it local but if you want the destination experience then do that. Two weddings is insane nobody can ask that of you unless they are paying.

But honestly I don‚Äôt think she was entitled at all she is a grown woman and can go where she wants why are you trying to control her? Also she wasn‚Äôt crying because she learned to listen to you you douche she was crying because her heart was broken have some sympathy what is wrong with you? Do you seriously need everyone under your thumb? She is an ADULT you or her kids cannot tell her what to do and what not to do.
Dying,f8debn0,t1_f82x7ay,1574487332.0,Don‚Äôt let that detour you. At ALL! I had abandonment issues forever and became super independent because of it. It took years before I would consider my income and my husbands as the same. Even longer to get a joint account because that was serious trust in someone. I‚Äôm good now great actually. You have to forgive you do. My grandmother shot my grandfather between the eyes on the day of my dads wedding because she walked in on him raping her 16 year old daughter and finally stood up to him and he beat her within an inch of her life and she fumbled around for the gun and got it and shot him. No jail time because of the way she looked. My dad did not end up marrying that woman. But no one shows remorse for him and never will because he was so evil. My dad apparently beat my brothers when I was a baby and was a very cracked out evil man back in the day. After I met him by accident he apologized to me every time we spoke for YEARS. I let him know I know that‚Äôs not who he is anymore and I love him and forgive him. But my older brother who pimped me out I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in 10 years. Also because he is a phyco and feels zero empathy or emotion and killed animals as a kid and knows how to kill people and in his words get away with it. I don‚Äôt trust him. Plus last I heard he went to jail for stabbing his roommate.
Dying,f82b9l1,t1_f80tc0n,1574187831.0,That is horrible! But I know how you feel as far as forgiving people who probably don‚Äôt deserve it.
AmItheAsshole,f7n5jd4,t3_dwvfyo,1573885179.0,No no you are not at all. Being married myself I would FLIP if I was in the wife‚Äôs position!! NOT COOL OF HER AT ALL. She is just looking for sympathy and wants to be noticed. If she cared so much about him SHE would have tried to be with him in life.
