We'd stopped into a fast food place after putting the clothes in the washers at the laundromat,  he ordered while I went to the restroom. When I got back he was watching something they had on the tv. While he was distracted I put an arm around his waist and with my free hand I slipped a finger in the hole in his jeans and stroked the underside of his balls. So many emotions went across his face in the span of seconds. Confution, shock, and horror until he remembered the hole, then relief and amusement, finally the cutest blush. I was crying."

I feel like it can be hard for cis women especially to understand what you've gone through. I remember thinking how much easier and safer boys had it and kinda wishing I was one. I really am sorry I was so insensitive. I didn't even stop to think that as bad as young girls have it sometimes, it's likely as bad, or worse,  for trans adolescents dealing with all that puberty brings while in a body feels wrong.

The grass always looks greener on the other side so I'm a little envious that she'll get to go though her puberty as an adult, therefore better able to enjoy and handle the changes and hormones.
