legaladvice,ewpqkkn,t1_ewpq50a,1565647028.0,"Thank you, I've thought about it. I just didn't know if I had a chance since I have no paperwork, no previous wills, etc."
ptsd,eu6dxrq,t1_eu52lwx,1563498087.0,"I'm right there with you on the EMDR ... total game changer! I've still got quite a road ahead of me, but with my experience so far, I know that it's worth it. I feel I'm gaining inner strength over time, strength I've never felt before ... which gives me hope. My night terrors have stopped and I'm learning ways to cope with anxiety and depression. I'm 51 and have been in therapy for what feels like most of my life. Since EMDR I feel that the therapy is ""sticking"" better as my brain is better able to function. That, and mindfulness (SO have a lot of learning on this too) have been the best tools in my kit ever! All my best to everyone on here. Keep on keepin' on ðŸ’œ"
ptsd,etk0m3c,t3_cbsb2l,1562885920.0,"That's wonderful! I've honestly not even thought of that possibility until now. Wow, gives me hope and I'm so happy for you. I know it's a ton of work and dedication. Thank you for sharing this! Keep on Keepin' on!"
ptsd,esaakyw,t1_esa5zuf,1561755324.0,"Yep! I have more to do as well, but I can tell you that even a couple if years later, I can ""feel"" it working.  It's strengthening and healing. It's actually quite amazing. My best to you ðŸ’œ"
ptsd,esa4vq7,t3_c6k8b6,1561751560.0,"I haven't experienced migraines, but definitely feel drained.  The cool part is, its definitely working. In my daily routines,  I notice I'm able to think more clearly, and many of the memories don't tear me apart from the inside like they used to. I hope these side effects pass for you soon."
ptsd,erw8ar0,t1_ervwq9z,1561336069.0,I'm so sorry you went through this. I can't imagine how awful that must have been. Thank you for sharing your process. ðŸ’œ
ptsd,erw61en,t1_eruor9m,1561334246.0,Thank YOU! This really helped me to relate. Some aspects of trauma are abstract and hard to pin down to analyze or work on.
ptsd,erw2zku,t1_ervk9zg,1561331805.0,"We tend to minimize what has happened to us, basically telling ourselves to get over it, it wasn't that bad. But, it was. These acts against you were/are damaging and your thoughts and feeling deserve to be recognized and honored. Something I try to do (not great at it yet) is to ask myself what I would tell my best friend? Or daughter? Would I tell them their rapes and dishonest relationships were nothing? Would I tell them to just get over it, get a grip? Hellz no! Be gentle with yourself.  Be kind to yourself. You deserve to be treated at least as well as your best friend ðŸ’œ"
ptsd,erw1yqk,t1_ervq82j,1561330996.0,"I'm starting to really see how true this is. It has always been known and accepted that I'm a lazy, useless, stupid, good for nothing pain in the ass who burdens others just by existing. People tell me not to dwell on it. It's less about dwelling on it and more about knowing these as facts in my life.. Only through EMDR have I been able to challenge those thoughts, look deeper and process information differently. I'm so grateful there are groups like this and help available. Thanks everyone! There's a long journey ahead. Keep on keepin' on ðŸ’œ"
