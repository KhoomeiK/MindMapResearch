aspd,fqr0upj,t1_fqr0ix5,1589575506.0,That’s for the best. A lot of people still view us as cliché horror movie serial killers. It gets tiring.
aspd,fqr0lyr,t1_fqr0e27,1589575379.0,Most do. I was too curious for my own good.

aspd,fqr0661,t1_fqqzfg3,1589575149.0,"If you want proper therapy, want to know what’s actually going on, or for people to take you seriously. However, getting a diagnosis of ASPD can also just lead to doctors treating you with less respect or treating you like you’re a complete monster. It really just comes down to wether you WANT an official diagnosis or not if there’s little to no treatment options."
aspd,fqqyqrt,t3_gkgo97,1589574398.0,"If they’re anything like my therapists- tell them your symptoms and not what you suspect you have. Every time I’ve gone to a psych and mentioned something I’ve done thorough research into that I have a lot of symptoms of, they IMMEDIATELY brush it off onto some other disorder that doesn’t fit me at all. This isn’t always the case, but it happens a lot. 

(It took years for my psych to realize that I had little to no empathy, even though I was very open about it. This has happened to me twice, with both ASPD and another disorder that is highly stigmatized. Surprise, I had both and wasn’t exaggerating.)"
BirdHealth,fqquyst,t3_gke8dg,1589572423.0,"It sounds like there might be an issue with his brain, and he likely needs medical care ASAP. 

Please take this idea with a grain of salt- look into domestic animal laws in your area. If you’re allowed to keep starlings as pets, you could possibly bring him in to an avian vet and claim him to be your pet. (I wouldn’t recommend releasing him anyways if he’s invasive where you are). Be careful if you do try to do this, and do a lot of research. 

I wish you guys the best.

Edit- I don’t have training in veterinary care, and a few years ago I attempted to rescue a wild bird that had brain damage on my own, and it died. It displayed the same symptoms. Taking animals to someone who knows what they’re doing gives them the best chance at survival, even if you feel as though your care is the best option for them. 

Where I live, we have a Wild ARC that took in a sparrow my friend found. They labeled it as an invasive species (which it wasn’t) and I panicked and called them. It turns out that they don’t actually euthanize invasive species that are brought in, as it doesn’t do much to lower the population. I hope this helps."
AnorexiaRecovery,fpym0b3,t3_gg7v2m,1589006072.0,"Fellow trans guy here- I didn’t eat more than usual (not restricting), I just ate what I wanted to and made sure I was eating enough. As for exercise, I followed certain workouts that weren’t too rigorous so as not to trigger a relapse. I definitely gained muscle before I had to stop because of other health issues. 

I hope this helps!"
aspd,fh1p35v,t1_fh1n1cq,1581220120.0,"For the most part, yes. I very rarely pray or make offerings, so most of the stuff I do, it's because I achieved it and not an anonymous entity. From what I've learned of life, gods just watch people suffer. They don't do much to help out if they even actually can.

Alright, now here's the best story I have. Might get a bit longwinded or boring, but y'know, why not? (it's not directly about me having aspd since I didn't tell her, but it's a crazy Christian story alright)

So, I take public transit regularly. We get a lot of weirdos where I live, but most of them don't bother me because they accept me as a ""fellow weirdo"".  (I dress like you'd imagine a stereotypical sociopath would, so I'm automatically the Bane of public transit). The religious ones, though, almost always try to 'fix' me. I was sitting on the bus, minding my own business when this lady sits next to me. That's normal, it's a busy city, but damn does she have courage. She starts making small talk, so at this point, I'm dreading the rest of the ride because I absolutely hate social interaction. Then, she notices my keychain, which is shaped like a book. No title. Just a book. This woman just GRABS it and asks, ""Is that a bible?"" I gave her a withering look and say, ""no, it's just a book."" and I go back to whatever I was doing.

End of conversation, right? nope. She asks me if I'm religious. That caught me off guard for some unknown reason, so I answer her honestly. BIG mistake. She starts ranting about how I've been abused, I've strayed from the path of the Lord, and God will forgive me if I turn back on the right path. She won't let me get a single word in. Yeah, lady, I've been abused, but you're not a goddamn psychic. I try to shut her up by saying that I'm in pain (yay for physical disabilities) and that I'm not in the mood for this kind of talk. She lifts her hand up and touches my forehead, then proceeds to start praying for me and saying that she'll fix me. I had to physically restrain myself from shoving her out of her seat. 

Unfortunately, that's not even the end. She proceeds to talk about how I am a damaged woman for having short hair (I'm a guy, with really terrible genetics that makes me look androgynous at best). That's it. I get off the bus, and she gets off at the same time and tries to follow me. I'm not having it, so I speed-limp to my apartment. I'm honestly impressed that I didn't get myself kicked off the bus for good, considering my reputation.

That's it, I guess, and that's why I stopped believing in that particular god a long time ago. Hope you enjoyed, if you didn't get bored, that is."
aspd,fh1mcrw,t3_f12dul,1581218084.0,"I'm loosely pagan, though I have to say that a lot of religious people frustrate me with their beliefs (I've had a lot of people tell me I'm going to hell, for things I can't control). Hopefully this is a better answer than ""just have faith"", but I like the work that goes into it and feeling as though I have a connection with various gods. It's kind of a power trip, honestly, but sometimes it just brings meaning to my life. I don't care about morals or religious laws very much, and I'm not 'blinded' by the concept of a god, most things are just coincidence and nothing more. I perfectly understand where you're coming from, though. I have plenty of crazy Christian lady stories if you want to hear more ;)"
BirdHealth,fgu2fhm,t3_f0hakd,1581112475.0,"If you've already given her a bath, I'd advise taking her to the vet. The bill will likely be expensive, but they'll be able to provide her with the best care possible (depending on your vets, I've had some awful ones, but it's the best you can do). This is especially important if her behaviour has changed at all since the incident."
AnorexiaNervosa,ffyscjk,t3_evvc40,1580353937.0,"Everyone in the comments has said what has needed to be said. It's going to be a rough journey, and she might hate you for a while but I guarantee that one day, she'll forgive you. I've been through the same process with my parents, and even though they were doing the best they could for me I hated them for it. Eventually, I understood that it was because they cared about me. If you need someone to talk to, or if she does, I'm here. I'm 15 and I know how utterly devastating anorexia can be. You are doing the right thing, and I wish you the best."

Taxidermy,f8u78sk,t1_f8o9q00,1574821157.0,"Yeah, my issue is probably that I don't replace Borax very often, if ever. That would explain a lot. I'll definitely take the guts out of my next specimen, but definitely not a pet... I think the next round I'm going for cremation!"
Taxidermy,f8o3i44,t1_f7nbv2q,1574661376.0,"I read about using volcanic rock somewhere on the world wide web, and it's the only thing that has ever successfully worked for me in terms of mummies, so I'm not so sure about the 'least useful' bit, haha. He may well be, but I'm hoping he'll at least be partially mummified. My optimism may well be the death of me. Thank you"
Taxidermy,f8o3bu5,t1_f7nbpf2,1574661186.0,"I would have used a traditional method, but I was in shock, as his death was very sudden and a personal loss. I've been rather unsuccessful with borax, ironically, and all the specimens I've worked with have decomposed regardless, but I will try as I don't really see another option. Thank you!"
ehlersdanlos,f68d6n9,t3_dqlpsu,1572727641.0,"It's perfectly understandable that you're frustrated. I had a similar experience with my doctor, and I was diagnosed with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder, but I still feel as though there is more going on that coincides with hEDS symptoms, but I also wonder if I'm not just a hypochondriac. I would recommend getting a second opinion if possible."
EatingDisorders,eykddbr,t3_cx9x3l,1567146047.0,"As someone who has had a lifelong battle with anorexia- you have nothing to make up for. Her anger is fueled by what her eating disorder wants. Sooner or later she will understand, although the journey is painful for everyone. Looking back, I wish someone had held me accountable (not that anyone is to blame in this sort of situation). It would have saved me from a very long and tiresome journey."
BirdHealth,eurnfed,t1_eun1j1k,1563996398.0,"Yes, I love his channel! The hatch rate is definitely quite low in terms of refrigerated eggs. I though that since they're fertilized there might be a better chance, but as CyclonicTaurus mentioned, even if they hatched they would probably have issues. I don't quite know how to word it, but my feelings got the best of me, and I figured I'd ask for advice anyways. Thanks for your feedback."
BirdHealth,eurmrdt,t1_eun8mda,1563996141.0,"That's what I thought. I doubt any wildlife centers in my area would take them in. I'm not all that upset about it, I know it's a cultural thing but I just figured that if I could give them a shot then I would. From the feedback I've received (and the amount of downvotes I got, haha) I'm not going to try to incubate them, especially considering the fact that I'm not well equipped. Nonetheless, thanks for your help."

BirdHealth,euhomek,t3_cgf1fa,1563831208.0,"I am by no means a professional, only a bird enthusiast, but here's my advice seeing that there's not much in this thread at the moment- Take him to a wildlife rehab center or worst case scenario, a vet, but make sure they don't intend to immediately euthanize him. It's all too common. If neither option is possible, Try to find what bird he is (there's a lot of apps and websites you can use depending on your location) and feed him accordingly. Baby birds require a LOT of food, and keep him warm as well. If his leg is broken, you could splint it, but  please do more research before any action is taken. I wish you and him the best!"
birdwatching,euhl0eu,t3_cgdj8b,1563829267.0,"Picture is kind of blurry, but I'd also say they're starlings. Beautiful, but very noisy and invasive."
