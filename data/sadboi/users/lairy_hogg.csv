Tbh to know about this as a 1st year undergrad is impressive! Keep that interest alive!

I do not know of John D. Clark - I shall look him up! Tbh whilst I love rocket science I’m lacking in the education of it, managed to take a few courses here and there on explosives & astronomy but unfortunately I didn’t manage to bad a research project on in my final year. Ended up studying spectroscopy & OLEDs for 9 months instead!"

Fortunately it worked out because the course was about explosives.

chemhelp,fpckcg0,t1_fpchqzh,1588503782.0,"I’ve just finished an MChem in Chemistry, and I knew a few people who studied for an MEng in Chem Eng personally i believe you learn more about the quantum physics of chemistry in straight chemistry than chem eng. Also, understanding synthesis is valuable for anything chemistry related.

I am currently working in the oil and gas industry, and let me tell you, industrial chemistry is boring as fuck, keeping stuff academic & research focused is a solid idea.

Basically from my experience: the best way to get into computational chemistry is doing a Masters in straight chemistry and focus on physical chemistry and computational chemistry in your final years / projects

EDIT: I see you’ve already got a BS in CE, I would recommend talking to academics at a uni with a good computational chemistry group. They will appreciate the CE background. If you really want to go into computational chemistry I would recommend just going for a PhD. I’m not sure there are any masters courses that could bridge you towards chemistry. If I was in your shoes I would do talk to academics and basically ask them about what you’d need to do to study for a PhD in computational chemistry."

politics,fojhfzl,t1_fojfjyh,1587820995.0,"This. It's the same in the UK and I find it bizarre how people can't get their head around it. People vote against their own interests because they've gotten to the point in the life where they would rather just get on with life than upset the status quo and have to be confronted by a way of thinking they might of left behind a long time ago. 

I feel like that was a bit of a rouge point but for example: voting right-wing is effectively the easy option; you want more money? vote for tax cuts. You want more job opportunities? vote for immigration cuts. You don't like feeling that as a part of a global society your intrinsic societal worth is less? vote for nationalism.

Voting right-wing is usually the easier option, which doesn't require you to address the problems of society. It's inherently selfish so by default its the option that requires the least amount of engagement."
chemhelp,fnvccwd,t3_g3v7ze,1587287957.0,"So I wrote out a long answer about how to form a stable foam. Then reread this question and realised it wasn't super necessary. So short approach is this:

Foaming happens when then surface tension of the solution is low enough to mix well with the gas phase / stabilise gases formed when mixing (if there are dissolved gases in the solution). 

So if your dishwasher detergent isn't foaming its because (as discussed in other comments) it hasn't been designed to. What this means is when the detergent is in solution the surface tension of that solution is high enough to not form a stable foam - this could either be because (1) foaming agents haven't been added or (2) anti-foaming agents have been added.

Now with regards to the chemical aspect of this question there an important factor to consider. In the context we are talking foaming is effectively a binary property i.e. it either does or doesn't foam. Which means that chemically there won't be much in the way of specificity because there isn't one chemical that simply makes a foam. 

\*However\* - the key issues here is surface tension, so chemically speaking the answer to your question is that the surface of the solution is 'high tension' or there is a lot of intermolecular interaction at the surface. Think of water, the classic example of a liquid with high surface tensions and it has lots of intermolecular bonds on the surface.

Basically to try and answer your question ""*how is it chemically possible to make a detergent that doesn't form bubbles?*"":

Chemically speaking - to reduce the formation of bubbles you need to add compounds that increase stabilising intermolecular interactions at the surface of the solution / phase. This could either be homogenously (soluble anti-foaming agents) or by the addition of another phase i.e. oil to a water based solution (where the oil forms a stable phase on top of the liquid).

Ngl, I had a pretty solid idea of what was going on but I think wikipedia is the place to find the detail you want:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defoamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defoamer)"

But my advice is to reach out mental health services, find a professional who will take the time to listen to you and try and work through it.
