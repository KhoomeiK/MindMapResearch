BPD,fn44cfd,t3_fzcwkx,1586633796.0,"Consider this:  the fact that you're going through everything that you're going through right now, with all of the disadvantages and challenges that are unique to you, and you're still standing and reaching out for help even, means that you are one fucking amazing human being.  You have great potential to get through this and grow from it and end up even better than you've been before.  It's going to require a bit of work and pain on your part, ok a lot of pain, but it's absolutely doable if you just put one foot in front of the other.  Get up every day, even if you have nothing planned.  Take a shower and get dressed, even if you have no job anymore and nowhere to go.  Go outside and walk, even if you have nowhere to go.  Just keep moving your body, and eventually your heart and your mind will follow.  I had to do this to get through my dark days.  I still do this.  It works.  One way I've coped with overwhelming negative feelings is to just let them wash over me and feel them and tell myself it's good to feel them, tell myself it's building my emotional muscle, because I've spent so much of my life running away from my powerful emotions.  It's like lifting weights, the more you do it, the more you practice, the easier it becomes and the heavier you can lift. I know you're still devastated from your breakup, but imagine how sweet it would feel if, 6 months from now, you bump into your ex by accident and you are in a healthy emotional and mental state?  How attractive would that be to her?  To any other woman you might be interested in dating?  6 months is nothing, my friend.  You can do it.  Also, single black people in their 40's are super attractive; don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Deep breaths and long walks, ok?  Hugs to you."

But how do you do that?  Practice LYING out loud in advance:  ""my parents are going to buy the car for me; I'm just doing the research so I can convince them.  My dad's going to want to come check it out for himself and I know he's going to want to know ____.  He's super busy so he won't come in just to get this information.  He's never going to buy it if I don't give him the relevant information first.  Ok, I'll let him know what you told me and we'll get back to you.""  I'm sorry that you even have to worry about this, but such is the world we live in.  You seem so mature and intelligent; you're definitely doing things the right way.  Best of luck to you!"
personalfinance,faetgxx,t3_e8tkdv,1576007834.0,"Ugh, reading your post gave me PTSD from when I was given false positive STD test results many years ago.  Sorry you had to experience that, on top of the many inconveniences and costs.  It's very traumatizing, regardless of which STD is involved, and, depending on how carelessly your situation was handled, you might want to make a written complaint to the medical office as well as possibly whatever state governmental entity oversees it (like a healthcare ombudsman or something like that).  As for the financial side of it, while I would definitely demand that the office reduce their fees for the pain and hassle they caused, I can't see it being a scam to get more $ from you.  The amount isn't worth them possibly getting a complaint (like for malpractice) and having to report it to their insurance company.  Good luck finding a better provider in the future!"
personalfinance,f4huadx,t1_f3xon5r,1571596199.0,Don’t wait to get a lawyer before writing up a basic will. Anything can happen at anytime (as I’m about to board a plane). Do a free fill-in-the-blanks will that you can get for free from any public library website for your state. They are just as valid as long as you follow the instructions. Then when you have more time/$ hire a lawyer to redo your basic will.
personalfinance,f3vpqxm,t3_dibjxs,1571181789.0,"Sorry to hear about your MH situation.  In addition to shopping other life ins companies for term policies, when/if you do buy a house, I believe you can buy ""mortgage insurance"" (probably similar to PMI, which is mortgage ins that's required when you don't put 20% down) in case the borrower passes.  Not sure how it works and if it's more or less expensive than traditional life insurance, but I know I've seen policies like that issued before.  Other than that, just keep saving what you can; maybe don't keep so much cash in the checking account, or at least make it a high yield savings account?  In the event of your death, your accounts/assets will go to your son.  Best of luck to you!"

I've looked into EVERY kind of surgery too (except lasik which I can't do), but have not had the guts or $ (mostly time off work) to do anything about it yet.  Some day, maybe.  Or, I'll just wait until I get so old I get cataracts, then insurance will pay for ICL surgery.  Best of luck to you!"

BPD,ez8bv0c,t3_czwcod,1567739138.0,"I am haunted by the memory of being a little kid, riding in the car with my family, looking intently at the lit windows of homes we passed, and wanting so, so intensely and desperately to be in there instead of where I was... in the warm places with the presumably happy, loving, welcoming people...  That feeling of quiet desperation...  it comes and goes still."

personalfinance,etyio70,t1_ety8uo4,1563318534.0,"Yep.  I have several attorney friends who are almost guaranteed to show up with an expensive new purchase--new BMW, new rental property--or an expensive future trip after being buried in work for 6 months.  Those types of purchases never happen after long periods of steady but not back-breaking work.  Very predictable.  And sad.  The cycle just repeats itself over and over again.  Work hard, buy treat, life gets more expensive, work hard/er to maintain, buy more treats, rinse and repeat."
Divorce,ete6n2e,t3_cb6xlh,1562724268.0,"Ugh, I feel you so much!  I've had to have the ""not everyone shows love the same way, and different people like to do different things"" talk with my own 8-year old quite a few times by now.  It does get better, as she has come to accept that daddy has different priorities (to put it super kindly) than to play with her as much as she wants (although she'll say ""at all!"").  Also, I've brainstormed with her different activities to try with him that he would actually be open to doing, like board games, and that has helped a bit.  She's thrilled if he sets 45 minutes aside a week to play a board game with her; that makes me so happy and resentful towards him at the same time.  Lol.  You sound like a great mom, and therapy will definitely help the little ones.  Remember to take care of and be kind to yourself too!"

lonely,erdceet,t1_ercli34,1560737500.0,"Here's another thought: as you get older (you said you're working?), different people feel differently about birthdays depending on how they were raised. As someone in my 40's, I kinda dread birthdays and having that attention on me now.  Lol... As for my family, once the kids left home (20's), we just stopped celebrating/acknowledging birthdays, period. Probably a cultural thing, you know, but even many of my American friends don't really celebrate their bdays with their families.  I noticed my American friends who grew up in really close, tight-knit families are the ones who still get HB wishes from their families every year. Funny thing is that as me and my siblings get older, we're actually getting closer and now DO wish each other HB every year.  It's kinda strange, sad, and comforting all in one, like we now know our time together left is limited (gah!).  As for ""forcing"" people to celebrate with you, don't think of it like that at all.  As you said, people enjoy hanging out with you, so they're probably happy that you reached out to them and shared something so important (to you) with them!  Unless they're like your best buds/friends, most casual friends may not even know that birthdays are a ""thing"" for you. They still won't give it the same level of significance as you do, but, again, that's probably just because of where there's coming from as far as birthdays go."
lonely,ercnn84,t3_c1ahq8,1560717011.0,"Whatever else you have going on, just know this:  you are an awesome writer and communicator!  I can tell from your post.  As one myself (lol), I know what I've talking about.  Hang in there as ALL pre and teens go through these emotional ups and downs; it WILL get better.  For making friends at school, join a club, even if you don't think you're that interested in the subject!  You will automatically have something in common with the other members, and you will automatically have group activities to engage in with them.  It's like having friends on auto-pilot!  Also, making and keeping friends is like anything else--the more you practice, the easier it gets.  As for your thoughtless ""friends,"" that's just it--most people don't ""think"" about anything else other than what's right in front of their nose.  Maybe you're friend #3 or #4, so you'll most likely not be the first choice for 90% of the activities.  Try not to take it personally; it's not YOU that is the problem, it's just that the majority of people in the world tend to be selfish and have a narrow focus.  Things will get better!"
lonely,erckvxe,t3_c1daqk,1560714904.0,"Don't discount your issue/feelings; it's just as important as everyone else's (telling myself this also!).  As I've gotten older, I've realized that if I want company on any special occasion, I have to plan for it and make it happen.  For example, I don't want to be alone for Thanksgiving, so will make an effort to travel to see family.  If I don't want to be alone for my birthday, I have to set up a lunch/coffee/dinner date with a friend or even work colleague to ""celebrate.""  As a very independent adult, my guess is that most of my friends/family perceive that I don't really ""need"" companionship as much as others so I'm not on their radar much.  It's not that people don't like me or being around me.  I'm very sociable and friendly and a good conversationalist.  I do tend to keep people at arms length, however, finding it hard to open up and be vulnerable about myself even though I'm a great listener for others. Not sure where you're located (I'm PST) but I'll be thinking of you tomorrow/Monday and wishing you a very happy birthday!  :-)"
