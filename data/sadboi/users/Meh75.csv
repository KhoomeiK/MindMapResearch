An old man in his 60s came into my store and asked for help to find a toy for his wife. I then asked him what kind he was thinking of, clitoral or G-spot stimulation. He just stared at me blankly for a moment and replied ""What do you mean, clitoris or G-spot? The clitoris IS the G-spot!""

It was truly tragic. I had to inform him that it was in fact NOT the same thing at all. I felt so bad for that poor wife."

If she really is depressed, she needs to make a move and talk to a professional because nobody will do it for her. She has to help herself before you can help her.

I know what it's like not to want help. I was the same way a few years ago (I'm 25 for reference). But one day you have to wake up and start your own life, no matter how hard it can be to find your ""normal"". You're not an asshole for wanting your daughter to get it together. You were very understanding and supportive of her possible issues, and that in itself is amazing parenting.

AmItheAsshole,fmyutrr,t1_fmxjm1z,1586496436.0,"Same here. I have a cat named ""Ham"" in my native language, and when he's being a jerk I often make jokes and tell him that I'll throw him in the oven with a few pineapple slices or something. That doesn't mean that I hate him, that I abuse him, or that I want to eat him. Definitely NTA."

Sometimes when I find an old hair of mine that isn't my current colour anymore, I go ""Who does that belong to??"", and my boyfriend will reply something around ""I'm sorry, I couldn't help it!"", and it's just the kind of things we find funny since we're the least jealous people possible. It just depends on the kind of humour you share with your SO. There's no shame in being a bunch of idiots once in a while."
