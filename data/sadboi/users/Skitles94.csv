Fallout,fq5fkgv,t1_fq515rv,1589103479.0,I mostly play it on console but my pc can run it for an hour before having a mental breakdown (it's a bit old) but I've seen mods or commands that remove her entirely from the quest line would be a 10/10 mod  she winds me up so much
kingdomcome,ff5qckh,t1_ff5q7o6,1579605928.0,Ah okay I thought not locking on was the thing to avoid I'll try to remember that. Thanks alot :)

mentalhealth,f8kbyq9,t3_e0xumk,1574609595.0,"Nobody noticed my depression and I went to the doctor about your ages saying I'm depressed and he gave me get help leaflet...I felt so abandoned at that moment and ten years on it all came to ahead and I've just started actually getting help. 

I'm happy to pm if you want someone to talk to who is also getting help although my guess is I'm a little late here and you already have enough people to talk too but hey. 

Ps I'm not old I only just noticed I use the when I was your age thing haha"
mentalhealth,f8k9foo,t3_e0zbeq,1574608893.0,"Well talking to them is I thinks the best to be honest.
If you set the tone as ""I'm going to be talking about serious shit please listen"" and then just explain it's very god damn hard but I would set some loose rules. 

I dont think you can avoid the gloves all the time but setting some boundaries on the topic that can be bent or broken if your feeling up for it. I dont think people will pity you more as feel bad about themselves not having noticed or helped you before. 

But everyone's situations different 
I'm going through depression at the moment and have had a fair amount of suicidal thoughts and my reasons for not doing it at various times was because I didn't want to let people down. I'd feel guilty before I did it and I cant handle that personally. 

But recently I basically stopped functioning overnight (been getting far to much stress at work)
Stopped eating,showering or even getting out of bed. And that's when I let my dad know and I'm getting help now and I hate the gloves too but I explain what's happening at that moment making me anxious is the gloves and whatever else and then it's okay for me. 

But that's me, there are loads of places (I'm in uk) where you can talk to independent people who wont make you do anything or talk about anything you dont want. A place called MIND is where I'm going monday I've heard they are really good. 

I hope this fits together and makes sense and helps sorry for the length pm if you wanna chat"
mentalhealth,f8k4nu0,t3_dmyjnu,1574607427.0,I'm struggling with depression at the moment (that I think has been there for most of my life) and I have the same issue although it was mostly on a few day in a row but the main reason I did shower was because of work. But i get it. It can be a big deal so good on ya and all the best

prisonarchitect,f7903g6,t1_f78zoab,1573500760.0,I'm thinking it might be the timelapse if your game pauses before crashing that might be it trying but failing to do the timelapse
prisonarchitect,f78y9jx,t1_f78swy2,1573500034.0,I found the games better in 32 bit mode since I did that I have only had one crash I also changed the timelapse settings to the lowest everything

Fallout,etmjcgv,t3_cccay7,1562961241.0,"There is a guide by Oxhorn I think I could be wrong. But I did manage to do it without using console commands it was a while back but I remember needing very good stealth and high speech. You need to pass a speech check to make Elijah to come to you. There is a object of some sort just to the right of the vault entrance hide behind that as elijah comes down and very very very very slowly go around it and sneak to the elevator door. 

I did it on console but I'm assuming same method works on pc"
