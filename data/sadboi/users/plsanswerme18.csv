men’s mistreatment of women has lead to a shit ton of years systemic oppression. some rando woman on the internet saying how much she hates men doesn’t really do shit.

yes, FP is just a term used to refer to codependent/unhealthy idealized relationships. when you’re in the midst of one of these relationships you know they’re fucked up and not fun and unhealthy. they’re agonizing. but this whole disorder creates a lotta fucked up & unhealthy behaviors. (which we should actively be trying to change!)

i don’t see the problem with talking about it, bc it is normal for people with bpd. i think a lot of are lives are super painful and hard and i think this forum is a really nice place for some of us to unwind and just have more frank conversations about our disorder without prefacing that it’s unhealthy because duh. when i’m spiraling because someone hasn’t replied to my text i’m extremely aware of the fact that i’m behaving like a fucking gremlin

so if a friend told you that their boyfriend had cheated on them 4 times, you would most certainly advise them not to stay together, right? 

i know how debilitating it can feel when a relationship ends, and it feels even more debilitating for people like us. it’s so so scary and reignites in us the things we fear the most. it feels like the literal end of the world, but it isn’t. it’s so awful but we’ve all made it through so many bad days and bad things.

you seem have a history of posting a lot of negative stuff about the LGBT community which is a little suspicious tbh. 

but if you’re truly having these problems, you can skip out on pride parades & any other overtly sexual LGBT spaces. you’re not required to go. since it looks like you’ve been to pride before & didn’t enjoy it, i don’t understand why you would go again. also talk to your friends about you feelings & feeling invalidated or make different friends. 

anyways the only requirement you have to fulfill to be a valid member of the LGBT+ community is to be LGBT+. you don’t have to behave a certain way or enjoy certain things to be valid, and it sucks it doesn’t always feel that way as a bisexual person."

i’m happy that you do your research but i don’t understand what that has to do with anything besides the fact that you may know more about makeup than the average consumer. i also know a lot about makeup. go figure. 

what metaphors? that you can’t turn crap into gold. i understand, i just the comparison is dumb. 

i’m happy that you have magic x-ray money eyes, but i don’t think most people do. or even care for that matter. so no, i can’t tell the different between if someone has hourglass or bobby brown or becca or cover fx on because it’s not about the brand. it’s about formula and skin prep and if your skin is compatible with your makeup. 

yea, again no. with makeup, or higher priced makeup you’re paying for packaging, the ability to test the makeup in-store, and the ability to return makeup products. that’s it.

makeup quality varies a lot, and i just think it’s ridiculous to claim that you can tell how expensive someone’s makeup is by looking at them? no offense, but that’s impossible. you can tell if the products bad, powdery, shittly applied. but not the price dude.

AskReddit,eqp7rsn,t1_eqo8ute,1560196775.0,"huh? this isn’t true, it’s about technique and finding makeup that works for you personally. you could be wearing $100 eyeshadow and if you can’t blend it doesn’t matter. 

also makeup has a huge, huge markup."
femalefashionadvice,eqaryz3,t3_bxyeo6,1559938779.0,this is so good and very similar to how i style myself when i’m not in a more professional setting! i love showing some skin
femalefashionadvice,eq0zo6l,t3_bwt94x,1559698048.0,"thank you for this OP! sivan is so striking (her bone structure is ridiculous!!!) and so is her style. i find her and her style to be so inspiring, she radiates a very badass sort of confidence."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,epydme0,t1_epwsv78,1559629207.0,"i think this is pretty simplistic, like of course no one owes anyone anything. but there’s still something to be said about kindness and empathy and the value of that, especially right now."
muacjdiscussion,epxazse,t3_bwaroy,1559596261.0,"darker lipsticks! i rock them all year around, and can pull off a deep red, deep purple, and even a glossy black and have them always appear really natural regardless of what. my current favorite and everyday color is a deep red with gray undertones."
polyamory,epspr3o,t1_epsp2lx,1559459417.0,"this was so incredibly helpful, thank you!!! i think that this is what i’m going to try to say and emphasize during the conversation, because it’s really what i’m feeling. i just have a big fear of being too restrictive and don’t wanna rock the boat unless it’s necessary. 

thank you again!! :)"
polyamory,epsadud,t1_eps9hym,1559442421.0,"yea, i think while i am comfortable with sharing most things w a potential partner, i think it just sort of killed the emotional/intimate flow that was happening. 

which is important to know and communicate, so thank you!!! :) i really appreciate the advice!"
polyamory,eps9g9k,t1_eps633e,1559441611.0,"thanks! yes, i think i would be okay if there were just more clearly established boundaries between us, but the whole interaction felt super young, and weird honestly. 

like we having a very nice and intimate moment beforehand. and just asks me to look at this hot girl who just snapped him and asking me if i thought she was trying to sleep with him and how he should reply, and then just like snapping her back with me sitting right next to him. it just me a little uncomfortable and very annoyed."
polyamory,eps9676,t1_eps589j,1559441370.0,yes! i think it’s partially that and just because the interaction felt very weird in a pretty intimate moment.
polyamory,eps92h2,t1_eps8f8h,1559441281.0,"I think yes, the phone bit could be it. But also he talks a lot about past/current partners and it doesn’t bother me in the slightest. 

Also I think there’s being open and honest and just sharing unnecessary information. Previously, partners have lied to me about their interest and involvement with other people when I asked, and that’s what I mean by deception. 

I think it just felt weird because this was only our 3rd date & things were feeling pretty intimate and he was just like “look at this hot chick who just messaged me on snapchat, do you think I could sleep with her? do you think she’s trying to sleep with me?”. And then like snapped her right back. It just felt super weird and not needed."
polyamory,eps4q2f,t1_eps4c23,1559437633.0,Yes! Of course. I think the problem is that this relationship isn’t really established at all and I feel weird coming to someone I just met with vague feelings of being uncomfortable.
polyamory,eps434f,t1_eps3v71,1559437110.0,"Probably! But I guess I’m having a hard time articulating why it bothered me! Like if it’s just my own insecurities at play, I don’t think it’s his responsibility to carry those feelings."
astrology,epkb2i9,t3_bv06xg,1559271462.0,"hmmm not really! i think it’s p flattering usually. i think while obviously people can’t know you completely right away, sometimes you just know you think a person is really cool. i just think think it can take aquarius placements a little longer understand our feelings, so it might seem inauthentic to us.  i have my venus/mars in aquarius"
astrology,ep7js6z,t1_ep56rw1,1559082703.0,"we’re almost astro twins! i have a cap sun, taurus moon and an aquarius stellium! but i’m also a big fan of art centered around cultural/social issues just because i think it can be super powerful."
Psychic,eoojmqx,t3_bsngmr,1558740182.0,are this going to get deeper romantically with A?
LesbianActually,eo8mcul,t3_bqp5ag,1558369903.0,"this is really gross behavior, no matter her feelings, it’s just a really icky thing to do to a friend. if you wanna continue to be friends, set some boundaries & call her out. it’s really really not okay to engage in that kind of behavior without prior consent, and she should know that."
LesbianActually,eo8lz0o,t1_eo7himq,1558369641.0,"idk, i think it’s a little bit more than inappropriate, it’s someone engaging in a sexual act like literally right next to you that you didn’t consent to. 

if you’re walking alone & someone whips their dick out & starts going at it...like they’re not groping you but it’s still really fucked up."
