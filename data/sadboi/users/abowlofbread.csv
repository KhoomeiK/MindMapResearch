pregnant,fjaekqo,t3_fcbq8z,1583171887.0,"I really only have a problem with early induction (39 weeks) without a medical reason. It seems to me the doctors would rather your birth be on schedule instead of having to be called in to deliver baby, it's easier for them. A due date doesn't really mean anything and of course doctors can still be off, even with early ultrasounds. The doctors seem to make excuses saying the baby's going to be ""too big"" and intentionally tried to worry me about low risk, even rare issues..that was mine and my friends case anyway. We weren't seeing the same doctor or even in the same state. I was being asked about induction since we were about 35 weeks and both of my doctors were a bit forceful about it. One dr even did a membrane sweep without my consent, even after I said I didn't want that. I had a very healthy pregnancy without any health concerns and once I reached 40 weeks they were saying I was overdue. My understanding for all 9 months was 41 weeks and over is overdue, I understand the placenta deteriorates, but it just felt unlikely at 40-41 weeks. I knew better, yet I still let the doctors stress me and make me overly worried about my babys health, which probably pushed back natural labor even more. I've noticed a correlation between early induction and long labors, like 12+ hrs with contractions, not even dilated enough to get epidural. That scared me.
I was nearing 42 weeks so I ended up CHOOSING to be induced with cytotec, 3 separate doses. They started at 12 pm, my water actually broke by itself at 12 am, and I had my 7lb baby girl..still covered in vernix, no meconium in the water, and overall just perfect. 

I just wasn't cool with them trying to push me to do something I didn't want to do and strongly felt wasn't the best option for me. I do feel as if me being closer to being 42 weeks had something to do with the quicker labor."

You say she offered to pay for the ticket, that's her mistake. Everyone goes through rough patches in life and cant always have the time to message a group chat. Sounds like she's not being understanding and thinking badly of you now, so if I were you, I'd definitely not want to go either. You should at least make sure you get the money back to her since she already paid for it. She shouldn't be paying for someone elses plane ticket, that's just a disaster. She should just give the ticket to someone else. 


YTA , yes...if you never pay it back.
You're jumping to ""well, she'll never get paid back for this"", when in reality all you have is time to gain the money back, especially since you can't miss work. At least make it up to her.


I had this done to me and it was a terrible experience. My best friend of 8 years promised to pay me back, went on the trip (that she created), treated me terribly the whole time, and of course she never paid me back. Now we're no longer friends. It still angers me when I think about it, she could at least contact me somehow to pay it back."
