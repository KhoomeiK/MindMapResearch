AskWomen,fn2mj3w,t3_fyxaex,1586594615.0,"Well, I have been struggling with that pretty much my whole life. 

There isn't a single recipe, really, and it surely it requires work, as it involves developing and maintaining healthier emotional habit. 

To me, it mainly comes to down to doing less, but better. To simplify. I used to think that by doing more things (work harder, have a larger personal network, buy more ""stuff"", travel to more places) I would overcome insecurity. I was always somehow ""competing"". This could not be more far from the truth. 

Only once I cleared up the table and started focusing on the essential, my self esteem started to grow. I started focusing on my strengths and began taking care of them. Nourish them. I chose my people. I gave away clothes and shoes that I wasn't really using. I begin saying positive things to me instead of pushing me down when I made a mistake. I started to give value and be grateful for everything that is in my life. To say ""This is more than enough"".  Also, I set myself the goal to accept compliments when I receive them, even if they make me uncomfortable (and they do, most of the time). Last year, I started making a list of qualities that I have that are meaningful in the specific context. For example, if I got rejected by a date, I started listing some qualities  that make me a good relationship prospect; if I failed to get a work promotion, I listed the qualities that make me a good employee. Then, I choose one of the items on the list and  wrote a short essay about why the quality is valuable and likely to be appreciated by others in the future. I discovered that doing this exercise for a week or whenever I needed it was a great self-esteem boost!

I try to practice a personal care ritual every day. Have a nice(long shower, do a 15 minute neck massage, do something helpful for another person, prepare a healthy dinner, send a loving message to a friend/my parents, go for a walk in the park, have some wine in the balcony while starting at the moon. Pray. These practices also sustain me and make me feel truly alive and good.

Also, ladies: I believe that if you are healthy, have food and a roof above your head, this is already enough to make you feel secure about yourself and to inspire you to give your best to the World. 

We are living in difficult, complex times. A lot of people die alone, without being able to see their families. Here in Italy some people are starting to run out of money to buy food and basic supplies. 

Let's all be thankful and responsible for our lives and choices, simply because we are breathing."
