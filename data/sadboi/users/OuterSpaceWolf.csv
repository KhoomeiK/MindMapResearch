Then in college I told my therapist some weird thoughts that I been having, then I started hallucinating, seeing some kind of humanoid figures. And in the end they told me I was psychotic, I also usted to freak out when I was young, I thought that everyone was my enemy and they wanted to hurt me. And in college I read that those daydream, where I go to a different scenario, are related to epilepsy, so that was the firts diagnosis."

And I know it's the same thing with every movie depicting the mentally ill as someone violent, but I do think some people end up doing bad things in some situations, besides they said he has some sort of paychopathy, but I don't think he had that in some way, I think he just had bad situations in his life that led him to do those things."

But what I remember on my days at college, is that you need to have hallucinations, atleast a delusion and maybe disorganized speech, for at least one to six months.
