phenibut,fpa8hd5,t3_gc543y,1588442946.0,"Dont take this the wrong way, but I'd guess your problems are related to abusing gaba drugs and not the other way around (I.e. that gaba drugs are treating some inherent problem). I've abused gaba drugs for the good part of 10 years and it sucks. The first step is abstinence from them. And when you've been using them awhile, the start of abstinence fucking hurts. Consider at least cutting down slowly and plan to get sober from them. NAC and agmatine sulphate can help you. Perhaps memantine too. Look into these. Gaba drugs mess up your glutamate-gaba balance which is why you feel shit without gaba drugs. The drugs I just mentioned can help to balance this. But the main thing you need is abstinence, time, healthy diet, sleep, exercise, and some mental health work (either from within or with a professional to help you). 

Take my warning, as I've learned this the hard way many times over: stop as soon as you can. It will only get worse with longer use. Benzos are destructive as fuck in many ways.

alcoholism,fnylu3x,t3_g4mtgm,1587367179.0,"Sorry but the general populations of those subs are not denying the existence of mental illness.

I.e. using medication as a first line defense for depression or anxiety without looking at what is actually causing those symptoms and the idea that diagnoses, and especially multiple diagnoses for a single person, allow people to fall into a victim mentality. No one is denying the existence of mental suffering, and perhaps the opinions there go against what you've come to believe, but your meme here is not representative.

Edmonton,fnu6l68,t1_fntsxcv,1587255587.0,"Unfortunately, the ""system"" we have for helping severe mental health problems is not adequate. I sadly don't have the exact solution to this problem, it is certainly a complex one, but I just wish people could view situations and people like this in a more humanistic way. His problem is a human one and not exactly a unique one. We need to do better as a society in figuring out ways to treat this stuff. The problem with forced intervention is that it will make things worse for him and we can't exactly lock him up/put him in an institution forever. When he gets out of whatever treatment center he would be put in he would have a brand new layer of disdain for the society that just put him through more misery. Sadly the way we approach these things doesn't change quickly and people, like him, will be made an example of in order to appease the people and make them feel that justice has been done. But trust me, there is no justice for that man. There is a storm in his head. It sucks and I feel for him and I also see the view of the public that he is simply far too disruptive and against the grain. Especially in times such as now where people have all sorts of new hardships. But another thought: think about how the pandemic may have affected his life and views. He might have taken it as some massive validation of his radical views. The ultimate solution is the early prevention of these types of development, but that is far from a simple or easy task. I do believe that a dialogue on public and free-speaking places like Reddit is a decent place to at least start. There sadly may not be help for this specific man and he may end up in jail or dead because there just isn't a solution to his mental health. But we should try to learn from whatever happens to him, and at least put in a solid effort, as a collective (not just one or two people), to try and help him. Can you imagine a world where suddenly everyone on the street was kind to this guy? How that would change his view of the world? In his eyes, everyone is a sinner and when people are mean to him it confirms this in his head. Then again, I don't know him personally, but I've walked by him many times and I've never seen him be aggressive physically or even verbally to a singled-out person or group. He is very vocal and believes what he believes very strongly. Maybe there is other anecdotal evidence that suggests otherwise, I don't know. It is certainly a tough moral dilemma and when I first came on this thread, it made me very sad that the general response was anger. Not even simple frustration, but hatred and pure anger. It's not right and it won't affect any positive change. We should be mad at our government right now (and I'm aware many are) and all the world powers that are being exposed as totally corrupt. Not this guy. Maybe people are just taking out their frustrations on him as they have no other outlets. He certainly doesn't need to be made into a martyr. I would absolutely love to hear anyone's thoughts on this and discuss it in a rational manner."

But I try to give people like this the benefit of the doubt. He doesn't seem to be an immediate danger to anyone's safety. If you have reasonable skills in reading people and their threat level I don't think it would be an issue chatting with him in a public space. I chat with homeless folks all the time. I've met some sketchy ones for sure and I don't stick around long but I've also met some really good people who have just found themselves in troubled times and have some serious mental health problems and long-lasting complex trauma that they are totally unaware of. It is fucked up and immoral how quickly people label others as bad people. Sometimes people just need to be fucking heard in their crazy lives. Could it turn out that this guy is dangerous and needs forceful intervention? Sure. But do we need to approach the situation as if that is the case? No. Do you claim to know his life as well, like how you've taken the liberty to somehow think you understand my life and my suffering?

Throwing him in jail or a mental hospital certainly is not the right course of action, in my opinion at least, so maybe other actions need to be taken by the community. He is, after all, part of the community. Perhaps he just needs someone to talk to and to validate the stuff that he is feeling and thinking in very real and probably frightening ways.

I guess the discussion should turn into how we can actually, realistically help dale sort his shit out and get him off the street corner. Maybe he just needs some honest compassionate discussion. Maybe he feeds off the anger and resentment I'm sure he receives on the street. Maybe Dale needs a friend in the flesh and not just one in the sky. Dale certainly presents a challenging dilemma to the society he lives in but I think we can do better to try and help Dale and in turn help us all. I've moved to Calgary, but honestly if I still lived in Edmonton, I'd go down to see Dale tomorrow and see if he wants to sit somewhere (with appropriate distance of course) and just chat about what in the fuck is going on in Dale's life and in Dale's head and see if I can get through to him.

It is honestly not a drug to fuck around with, so if you haven't been taking it regularly, then I recommend you keep it that way. If you have been taking it for an extended period of time, make sure you taper when you want to stop. Sudden cessation of clonidine can cause hypertensive crises. 0.05mg is a fairly low dose though so no need to panic or anything. Keep in mind it has a fairly long half-life, I believe 14 hours or so, so it stays active in your system for a few days."

That could be due to my ptsd as clonidine blocks the fear response. So a cut for me could be way worse than a cut for someone without ptsd. I also found it just made me lethargic and unmotivated at normal doses. Found it to be quite addictive also as it kills anxiety pretty well. I'd say its better than klonopin though in many regards. If its working for you then I'd just let it be. If you want to get off it though, make sure you taper as it can cause hypertensive crises if stopped abruptly.

My best advice is to try to exercise, eat well, and sleep as much as you possibly can as early as you can in withdrawal. All of those things are very hard to do during withdrawal but also what will help the most. To ease the suffering, gabapentin helps a bit with the mental aspect, black seed oil helps a bit with the physical. Magnesium, CBD, kava, vitamin C, all helped me in various minor ways. Clonidine will help a lot but I found out that it is actually a nasty drug on its own right so I don't really recommend it. You really just need to wait it out and embrace the pain.

Find some healthy ways to calm down, such as a long walk, a hot bath, call a friend, video games, etc anything to distract you for a bit. Try to take a step back and gain some perspective on the whole situation. Think of your addiction as a learning opportunity and a way to grow as a person.

cripplingalcoholism,fmrbim9,t3_fwwxjq,1586318587.0,"Hey, I feel for you. I know the feeling of thinking you've hit rock bottom, too well to be honest. But like some other people have pointed out, there is no such thing as rock bottom. Shit can always get worse. But things can also get better. At some point you have to decide if you want to have a chance at living or continue your slow death. I had to make that choice 4 years ago. When you are that deep in the shit, it seems like there is no way out. I know that fucking feeling. You have to find an ounce of HOPE that shit can get better. But the only path to get better is a long path of pain. It starts with putting down the bottle. That is the only way. I was the most destructive mother fucking drinker you could imagine. I was a spectacle for years to the people around me. I haven't had a drop in 2.25 years now and you could not pay me any amount of money to go back to that. I've got severe complex trauma now and have battled other addictions since the minute I quit. I am painfully alone in my shit but I've found my way to the beginning of recovery. I estimate my recovery time to be about as long as the time I spent drinking, so 8 years. There is no shortcut to fixing this level of trauma, but there is hope. I've come a long ways from where I've been. You can do it too but you just to believe that there is hope and start making tiny steps in the right direction.

As for logistics, I can't help you with the money situation but stay persistent and shit can turn around. I'll give you a piece of advice that changed my life. Save up and get a bag of kratom. Switch from boooze to kratom for now. It will keep the trauma at bay while you get your basic shit together. You will trade one addiction with another but it is much less destructive. You will eventually need to get off kratom to continue your recovery but don't worry about that for now. 

 PM me if you want. I can tell you the right way to go about kratom, I've had a long journey with it. Good luck. This shit won't be easy but it will be worth it in the end. You seem like a good person and you deserve a good life. 

PS. your description "" I was always the smart kid, quiet and shy but generally well behaved and intelligent."" fits me exactly when I was a kid. My dad was also a big drinker. Those traits are an affliction and a recipe for a wrong turn in life. Don't beat yourself up."
ptsd,fmqrrl6,t3_fwqvkv,1586305654.0,"Yes. This maybe isn't the nicest thing to say and I don't want to at all diminish the widespread suffering of people right now, but the pandemic has fostered an environment for me to actually thrive in. It feels as if I have time to catch up in this world. Like the focus (perceived or real) on me from the people who have hurt me has now totally shifted. It is hard to describe but it has had a really profound effect on my life. Of course, my tune could change if/when it kills someone close to me or if I get really sick, but I've also sort of come to terms with that being a real possibility and feel okay with it. I am, on the other hand, very fortunate in my situation, financial/environment wise. It's weird. I actually just moved cities before this happened and I am starting a brand new life here as the pandemic continues to unfold. Surreal stuff. Anyways, I'll stop ranting, but my point is that you are not alone in feeling that way."

Edit: I should add, in terms of therapeutic potentiation, I'd say they are not synergistic at all."

canada,fmm75du,t1_fmm1d6b,1586200024.0,To be fair AA doesn't really preach not dealing with the underlying issues. The whole point of the 12 step program is to dig into your past (i.e. trauma and shitty relationships) and come to peace with it. Not saying it's the best approach (not that I've actually gone through the steps) but it isn't as simple as staying abstinent while being ignorant to why you drink.
canada,fmm6p6q,t1_fmm1zuf,1586199785.0,I think you missed the point of the comment. The pandemic has put uncertainty into both the health and financial stability of a lot of people. By not drinking during the pandemic you can combat both of these uncertainties. I'd call it common sense but at the same time I'm not judging those who choose to get numb during this shit.

quittingkratom,fmm59ez,t1_fmm09ai,1586199036.0,"I have mixed feelings about clonidine. It did help in some ways, I also think it potentiated the kratom buzz when I was using them together, but I am also terrified of getting off it. I'm still tapering it to be honest, down to 0.025mg/night now. Be careful with it. It is not something you can stop cold turkey safely, especially if you've been taking higher doses for a while."
quittingkratom,fmlx6iy,t1_fmlviqj,1586194845.0,My timesafe was really useful back when I was using kratom therapeutically (3gpd only at night). But once things got really bad mentally (I was assaulted in November) the timesafe was of no use sadly. Best of luck.
quittingkratom,fmlx0vb,t1_fmlvdkb,1586194765.0,No worries! I was taking upward of 35GPD but also taking clonidine at the same time (dumb but I started it when I tried to taper and then ended up staying on it). So the clonidine may have played a role but who knows. I wish you nothing but the best with whatever method you choose to quit. Treat yourself with compassion and love first and foremost. You got this!
quittingkratom,fmluck9,t1_fmlsln8,1586193384.0,"I know the exact feeling my friend. I'll tell you what it took for me to quit (and I don't mean for this to freak you out, but maybe it will make you feel less alone). I tried to quit 3 times in the past 2 months (with the last one finally sticking). The first, I locked all my kratom up in a time-safe and had the company of my family dog and a big house to myself. I made it 20 hrs and found myself in unbearable PTSD hell. Ended up smashing the time-safe. Second time, the week after that, I started my taper. 5 days of misery largely from thinking about how long and agonizing the taper was going to be, so I cracked and usage shot way up. Finally, about a month after that, my kratom use was so out of control and I was utterly sick (physically). My body felt poisoned, my anxiety/PTSD was at an unbearable maximum, and I was having very strange heart ""episodes"". My dad died of heart problems last year so I finally committed to go through the hellish withdrawal. I made it 3 days before I had to check myself into urgent care, as I was so fucked up. They gave me a weeks worth of clonazepam which helped but only barely. I went through all this shit utterly alone and it was frankly one of the hardest periods of my life.

I am now about 40 days out and, while I am still struggling with many mental health things and still some GI issues, I am infinitely better than I was near the end of my kratom use or during the first 3 weeks of cessation. 

So what I am trying to convey is: 

1) you have to go through the withdrawal to get to the other side. It will be absolute shit. It will be terrifying and miserable and you will crave absolutely anything that gives you relief. But this is the price that we must pay for medicating our mental health with drugs. There is no ""free lunch"" in this world. Take all of the pain and misery that you feel and keep this fact in your mind at all times: it WILL make you stronger. 

2) Remember that things WILL get better. It is not forever and things are SO SO SO much better without kratom in our bodies. I'm sure you already know that. But keep it in mind when you are in withdrawal.

Do you have anyone to support you during this? That will make it easier. Stay strong, believe in yourself, push through the crazy shit, PM me anytime! Good luck!"
quittingkratom,fmlrrdk,t3_fw1h7a,1586192022.0,"I tried a taper from 30gpd and made it five days, dropping 1g per day, and cracked and went up to above 30gpd for awhile. Tapering for a kratom quit just draws out the inevitable misery imo. CT is hard but at least you can see the end of it. You aren't alone, whatever you choose to do. Good luck."

Sometimes it helps to just get it out to a real person. Things can get better, I promise. Life is fucking shit sometimes but if you hold on for long enough you will find that there are moments of bliss sprinkled throughout. They are worth living for."
wholesomememes,fmjebm5,t1_fmj7cr1,1586128597.0,"I'm aware of that but the major difference is in how they are used. Psychedelic treatment aims to be a one or perhaps few time usage while the current psychiatric model aims to have their patients take something every day. Psychedelics open you up and let you see your problems for what they are and face them head on. Anti-depressants allow you to ignore them, push them under the surface. You will never reach your true potential as a human being if you are numbed out by any drug. That is my opinion. 

And to your last point, do I have to be a medical doctor to have an opinion? Sure, I would love to be much more knowledgeable on the all sides of the topic and I intend on becoming so someday. But what I do have is years of experience in trying to survive and treat my own severe mental illness. Do you think that every single person who is taking zoloft has a thorough knowledge of the pharmacology and physiology related to what they are taking? Absolutely not. I agree that the existing knowledge base should be understood but you can certainly take the approach of starting at alternatives and working your way in. And to have the average person believe that the ONLY way to deal with their mental pain is through antidepressants is immoral. There are much better ways. There is a way to become healthy and fulfilled without psychiatric drugs. Take it from me, I was so unbelievably fucked up 5 years ago. I didn't think I'd live past 23 and here I am 26 now. The experience I have with this stuff is not from a medical standpoint but that does not make it any less real and people deserve to know that they have other options."
wholesomememes,fmj3msd,t1_fmj2ca9,1586122363.0,"There is a huge base of peer-reviewed literature on psychedelic medicine. It isn't some ""hippy-pseudoscience"", there is a ton of research done and being done in the field. 

https://maps.org/resources/psychedelic-bibliography

https://maps.org/resources/papers

Try those two links for starters. I could spend all day finding you scientific sources on the topic. Have you read How to Change your Mind? It is a very scientific and well-researched book on the topic and will give you a TON of credible research to dig through. How about The Body Keeps the Score? Have you read that? It is also extremely well-researched and comes from a leading professional in the field of mental health. 

Comparing mental health problems to cystic fibrosis and then pulling the ""I only listen to scientific discussion"" is absolute horse shit. Try stepping out of your box."
Teetotal,fmj0y4t,t3_fvffez,1586120833.0,Partake is probably my favorite. Local and Red Racer both have tasty NA beers. Sober Carpenter. Erdinger Alcoholfrei is good but high calorie. I live in Canada though so I have no idea if any of these are available where you're at.

wholesomememes,fmiyopx,t1_fmhbth3,1586119572.0,">In most cases depression is a genetic disease, and no changing of your environment whatsoever could improve your mental health.

UHHH you have any credible sources to back up that extremely bold claim? No offense, but this is a remarkably dangerous viewpoint to hold. I recommend reading the Body Keeps the Score to start and you'll get an idea of just how complex mental health problems are. Present-day environmental factors, relationships, financials, exercise, diet, sleep, MEANING in one's life, your upbringing and attachment as a child, trauma of all sorts, and yes genetics (although the extent is NOT entirely understood - there is some good discussion of this in The Body Keeps the Score) ALL play a role. I promise you, there are ways to beat mental health problems, including ""treatment-resistant depression"", without the use of psychiatric medicine. I have been fighting my severe mental health issues for YEARS and I have come a LONG way. I am actually going to write a book about it. Disagree with me if you want, I respect your opinion, but please try to keep an open mind.

&#x200B;

Edit: One thing to add is that the spreading of ideas like this, i.e. that depression is mostly genetic and there is nothing you can do to fix it other than gobble your prescribed poison that does who knows what to your brain long-term, is utterly dangerous and irresponsible as a member of our society. We are on the brink of moving PAST the current psychiatric model and mental health will one day be revolutionized by psychedelic medicine and humanistic approaches. Read How to Change your Mind by Michael Pollan, it might open your eyes. Stay vigilant people! Don't believe everything you read!"
