depression,ezncxk1,t1_ezn5zrg,1568004114.0,"again, as long as you keep thinking that way, things will never improve.  you have yourself convinced that because of the past, you automatically already have no chance for a future.  it may seem like you've tried everything and nothing is working, it doesnt mean something never will.  you have to keep trying and stay positive.  find the motivation, set some goals, be ambitious. its up to you, you have the power, and you can make it better.  you can drive to therapy, you can take pills, but neither of them are going to really work if at the end of the day you go home to the same life you've been living, no goals or ambitions.  you have no idea how similar your story is too mine, i used to say alot of the same things. 
 the other option is to just keep saying you've tried, nothing in the past has worked, its all so hopeless, and stay exactly the same miserable as you are now, forever.  i wasted years of my life doing exactly the same thing until i finally found a slight bit of hope and purpose.  my own brain was screwing me over telling me everything is hopeless.  i thought about killing myself a few times a week and now am so glad i didnt."
depression,ezn42xz,t1_ezmydsg,1568000632.0,"right, so nothing has worked *so far*.  i struggled with that same mindset, that ive tried, nothing worked, nothings going to work.  i had a negative filter on everything on everything in my life, so even if i went to the therapist, i couldnt change my negative thinking.  i didnt even realize i was sabotaging myself, i already had it in my mind that ive tried, and it didnt work, so therefore nothing will ever work.  it wasnt until i broke through that mindset that i really started to be able to make positive changes and feel better.  the therapy isnt sticking because your mind is already made up and you have the negative filter.  you've already written off your job coming in the fall that you think you could be fired within a week, thats your negative mind shutting something down before it even happens.  you're blaming your mother, that you, a 21 year old, is unable or unwilling to just take it upon yourself to find out what you need to do to get a diploma/ged.  as long as you stay stuck in the midset that 'you've tried' or that everything is just negative and hopeless, nothing is going to improve.  im not sure what kind of advice you want if you shut down everything with, 'nothing works, ive tried' or its my parents fault this or that, you are going to stay trapped in this cycle of negativity.  don't give up, keep trying even if it seems hopeless, because we already know the alternative is just going to be sitting around getting more and more miserable as the years slip by.  it took me many years but eventually i found my greatest motivation was not wanting to be miserable anymore.  i had to stop rolling around in my misery, fight it headon, and never give up.  im sorry if this sounds harsh but i can only speak for what has helped me.  ive had schizoaffective disorder, along with about every other minor mental illness you can think of for the past 12 years.  its a struggle every day and ill prolly be dealing with it the rest of my life.  we cant let our negative minds win and just give up, we need to refuse to be helpless and force ourselves to help ourselves, every day."
depression,ezmx953,t3_d1ks98,1567998125.0,"as long as you continue living the same way, you'll continue to get the same results.  trust me ive made that same mistake for years.  you can wait around forever and a better life is never going to come find you, you have to get out there and make it happen.  you thought it would get better 17-18-19-20, but what did you do to make it happen.  you have yourself trapped with the thinking you CANNOT even shower, so how would you do anything else.  that kind of thinking is going to keep you trapped into doing little to nothing.  your parents are right, you do need to try harder, and itll prolly suck and be miserable, but its the only way things are going to change.  as long as you keep telling yourself that you cant, things will never improve.  you say you tried all the advice on the internet, but id bet their advice wasnt sitting around and saying 'you can't' to everything.  turn to yourself for help, and make things better, because nobody else can do it for you.  things wont improve in a day or a week or a month, but keep working hard on yourself and things **will** improve.  keep saying you can't, and its like you've given up before you even started.  21 isnt too late to start a good life, but its way too young to give up all hope, especially when you havnt gotten out there and tried yet."
