She was probably trying to carry that light-hearted tone over to your conversation by using the same phrase, but OP instantly picked up on the other dude's scent (his half-joke) and was having none of it.

AmItheAsshole,eqposdg,t3_byzq5t,1560202243.0,"YTA

It sounds like your son is depressed about not having both parents in the same house and acting out (getting paranoid and yelling) because of it. I don't see the problem with his mother calming him down. He's calling his mother, not some other shady kid who peer pressures him into doing whatever the hell they do. It's true not all of his problems will be solved by being able to call someone to come rescue you, but he is a little child. A baby! Let him go cool down with his mother. And in the meantime, get him in therapy so he can learn healthy ways to calm down and cope when things don't go his way and when he is too old to call his mother for every little thing. Furthermore, I think the whole ""he can't come back because it's my time, grrrr!"" is pure ego. He's a lucky kid that he can just call his mom, who doesn't live with him, at any time and she'll be there. sorry but i really think your perspective is plain fucked up"

breakingmom,eptkh9o,t1_ept2yeo,1559492084.0,"I feel like the thing that always seems like the least abusive thing is usually way more severe than even the sufferer realizes.. then because they don’t think it’s that bad, they don’t get seen by a doctor and don’t get treated, or they see a doctor who isn’t quite hip with the times and rattles off some generic advice that doesn’t help and the sufferer ends up feeling worse, because there’s also a constant cycle of non-professional people who think they know much more than they actually do, who unknowingly cause more trauma and stress to the person who is already sensitive, by telling them to buck up and socially punishing them for not being able to. Then the person has all of the symptoms from the original trauma (which they didn’t know the extent of) as well as the trauma of needlessly feeling guilt for having symptoms of trauma. The cycle repeats into a dangerous downward spiral. 

More obvious abuse is quicker to spot, and more generally accepted that yes, attempting to break your partner’s face with your giant fist is abuse. 

A lot of times physical abuse is at the same time as emotional... I’m not trying to make it a competition between the two because they both suck. Just trying to describe the problem with emotional abuse that I feel gets neglected. It’s getting a little better though I guess"
