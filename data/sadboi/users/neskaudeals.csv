selfharm,evveat0,t3_cl88jq,1564833490.0,"What happened to you sounds really extremely painful and you should just know that everything that did happen isn't your fault. And i know how it feels when you damage yourself even if some other person is to blame in the situation. I know how hard it is to stop yourself from it, but you have to believe that you don't have to perish because of others' selfishness. I just really hope things get better for you"

relationship_advice,euaevn2,t1_euaelhf,1563614864.0,"Thank you so much üíì you're right, I think we need some time to grow up a bit"
selfharm,etlcu4u,t3_cc43dw,1562932228.0,"This is so important fr, after I started cleabing mine, my scars haven't looked that bad like they used to and it just feels nice bc maybe you can't take care of yourself in many other ways, but this helps a lot"
selfharm,es3ps1o,t3_c5i6g4,1561568005.0,"I totally understand. I promised not to cut, but a large part of me wants to bc my scars are fading and i don't want them to be gone. They feel like a part of me at this point"
selfharm,ersij4f,t1_ersh132,1561215081.0,Thank you so much:) i will have that in mind
selfharm,ers5xwg,t3_c3lbl7,1561201694.0,What's liquid bandaid? I don't think we have that over here :0
selfharm,ergsex6,t3_c1tdc3,1560855793.0,"Yeah. I feel like when I look at them, it just seems as if they're too small and I feel like I should still be cutting to prove to people and myself that I'm still not doing well, which is the case, I'm just not self harming anymore because I can't. But I look at them and sometimes it feels good knowing that I have something to prove to myself that I'm not doing well, but sometimes it just makes me want to self harm more"
selfharm,eq74k6s,t3_bxcdt0,1559840410.0,Good job !! I'm so proud of u !
SuicideWatch,epu9vy1,t1_epu9fdw,1559506280.0,I really needed that. Thank you so much
SuicideWatch,eptz4e9,t1_eptyxkf,1559500537.0,"It's okay, i'm okay, thank you very much. I just wanted to rant about this, because it's been affecting me for 5 years and I've just recently found this subreddit"
depression,eptxade,t3_bvup45,1559499482.0,"I understand you perfectly. As soon as I stop laughing everything dawns on me. And I feel like i'm starting to drift off somewhere bad, if that makes sense"
SuicideWatch,eptwsgp,t1_eptwbn3,1559499189.0,It's okay. Just wanted to say that i'm really sorry about what happened and I totally understand you. People like us are misunderstood so much and everyone thinks that we're fucking around. People think that I can't kill myself and that I wouldn't. And I can't tell them that I would if I only could get rid of the guilt that would come with it
SuicideWatch,eptwfii,t1_eptw15f,1559498979.0,Exactly. It's just pushing me to the edge and making me want to throw shit around and scream. It just makes therapy and medication feel useless
SuicideWatch,eptvrz6,t1_eptv1nf,1559498596.0,"It's so frustrating, but yet i'm glad that i'm not the only one, because i feel so left out and misunderstood all the time"
SuicideWatch,eptudwb,t1_eonx84e,1559497781.0,"I guess i'm okay. The thoughts never leave, y'know? It's like no one believes that I could do it"
selfharm,epsy0c3,t3_bvom3j,1559473262.0,"I've said goodbye to shorts a long time ago, but now i'm even scared to walk around in those that are down to my knees, because they slightly lift up and if you look closely, you can see rhe shit ton of scars on my legs. The biggest cut is quite high up, so that one isn't being seen a lot. Summer sucks because everything that's a bit shorter is like a hazard and you always think about what's gonna happen if something is going to slide up and all that"
depression,eojiop9,t1_eojhhf7,1558638410.0,"I'm okay. Dealing little by little. Just got home and ptobably going to go sleep. Hbu? How have you been? 
And I don't think that it's a waste if you really need the help"
depression,eojgxfr,t1_eojgfwy,1558637725.0,"I see her every Friday, so it is expensive yeah. I feel really guilty about making my mom pay so much for it. You shouldn't be ! But it is important to find the right person i think"
depression,eojg3t5,t1_eoja17v,1558637411.0,"True about the 5min thing:D it's not as bad. My mom pays 120‚Ç¨ per month, which is pretty okay compared to many others"
depression,eoj9ict,t1_eoj8yuo,1558634870.0,"I try my best to just get my mind off of it by watching videos on YouTube mainly. I've lost interest in a lot of my hobbies (which I've also pointed out to her, but she said that it's fine???? Idek). But i'm managing. This subreddit is really nice so far and i think it'll really help me:)"
depression,eoj81mz,t1_eoj6asb,1558634302.0,"I get what you're saying. And I really want to experience more than I have up until this point, but it feels like I need help, but I just can't get it most times. Because of my age i presume. But it just makes me sad that I've not been taken seriously at all"
depression,eoj7fym,t1_eoj60d0,1558634071.0,"Thank you so much. That is the most uplifting and nice thing I've heard in such a long time. No one has ever told me anything like that. Thank you so much, again. Already loving this place ‚ù§"
