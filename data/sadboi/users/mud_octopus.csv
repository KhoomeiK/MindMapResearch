Like first of all, I hate using sexuality to get attention for ads, no matter how good the message is. 

Secondly, it's actually a really gross as a phrase taken at face value without the small print, so why you spreading that message to anyone who doesn't look closer? 

Third, in the context with the small print, it's still gross to people with EDs, because a lot of us feel bad enough about even having an ED and not being able to just swallow and digest enough food like a ""good girl"". Also, a lot of people with EDs start it for people pleasing and feeling like you can't win either way causes distress.
