I ended up going hiking and I'm sitting in a pub (bad I know), but I've been good. Just had an Irish pot pie and I'm ready to drive home. 

I enjoyed it so much that now I'm feeling emotional about how much time I've wasted, how out of shape I am now, and the fact that life cant always be this soul fulfilling. 

Really dreading work tomorrow and feeling the negative feelings that brings up. 

I actually didnt have anyone going hiking with me. I'm solo. But I like it that way. 

You're lucky you have your son to keep you accountable! It must be nice to share hobbies together and build memories.
