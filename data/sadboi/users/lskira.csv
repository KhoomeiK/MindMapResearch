Sure maybe only measuring people getting out of poverty isn't enough to know how well an economic system is doing. Although it seems like a good indicator.

The argument against market crashes seems to correlate short term poverty raise with long term poverty raise. 

Even if we take into account market crashes, we can still say that capitalism raise people out of poverty long term. That is indisputable. If we mean ""capitalism"" in the more pure sense of the word. 

An economic system based on trade using money as capital and a future promise of money as credit. 

Now after those two definitions we can add the stock market, which is also something created on top of capitalism, and that has helped literally to discover the new world, America. It was the economic fuel to maritimal enterprises.

When you say social democracy you seem to correlate social political structure with what I mean about capitalism. As I pointed out, It was this pure sense of the word. 

I think even in Sweden I can say you guys use money, credit, and have a stock market, so any social or political decisions are created on top, and not parallel to this definition.

Now on to what we both agree with. We aren't sure if it can grow societies with sustainability in mind.

And that could be something improved under certain conditions. However I don't know right now how it can, not if we continue propagating consumerism.

However I don't see a way to fight consumerism without stopping whole industries from innovating, and we are at a point of no return in terms if climate catastrophe. 

My guess is that we can come to a point of sustainability using innovation in many different industries the same way SpaceX now did with rockets.

I disagree, you are teaching kids the nature of reality, not politics. There is a difference in teaching kids that there are homophobics out there and they should watch out, and being homophobic to your children. You can teach them how society is and still be on their side.

&#x200B;

Now here we are talking about different things using the same words I believe.

When I say people should judge, it isn't to automatically negate another, it is to be able to say ""I don't agree with that"".

And another thing is, because I want to get this clear, ""treating them differently"" how exactly? Are people supposed to treat them the same way a cis gendered person is treated? I don't think you mean that.

> The way gender roles have historically been enforced is extremely harmful. Are you arguing for a different form of enforcement? 

I'm not getting into the historically enforced argument because you haven't shown any clear cases that we can discuss.

What I'm arguing is, what I believe the same you are but using different words, to let people decide how to raise their children.

Most people are choosing to keep gender norm, and some don't,  now whether that means they are giving drugs to kids so they can change genders or just telling them the philosophy behind gender neutrality and expressionism is another different topic.

The thing that is happening is depending on your side of the argument ""people are enforcing me to raise my kids a certain way"", but you aren't seeing people from the right asking the government to make it ilegal to teach kids certain things. That is why gender expressionism has become a topic for debate.

Nobody creates marches to force the government to make it ilegal to raise autistic children in a certain way.

But people are doing marches to force the government to make it mandatory to teach gender expressionism in some parts of the world.

&#x200B;

And to that, I'm very much against. The state already has too much power over you, but having power over the individual and how it is raised is a recipe for disaster and complete chaos(or order for that matter).

That is what happens in North Korea, in pre WWII japan, and on and on. Let the state dictate completely what you teach children and you are on a one way ticket to complete order, which is also a recipe to chaos following. Because if you create an immutable state with perfect order, anything that threatens the order can make it crumble. Any system that is not prepared to sustain chaos won't grow, and any system that doesn't possess any sort of order can't grow either.

&#x200B;

Alright, you've shown me an occasion where that argument does make sense. But would you say that this case represents  the most number of cases that don't require legal change to affect positive change in society? We can talk about how to legalize drugs, teaching gender identities, and all other topics, but don't they somehow can be tested in larger samples of the population before government decides to create a new standard of living?

There is always the argument of ""it will only shown to be beneficial if the society as whole adopt gender expressionism or legalized marijuana or else"", but I'd think it could justify itself if it had clear data on how superior that type of raise would be to an individual.

Like vegetarians and vegan tend to have higher health indicators. It turns itself into a grounded decision if the government is to enforce that positioning. In  case of vegetarianism, at least there is some data proving how better it can be. But I haven't personally found data on how it can be better for an individual to be raised outside gender norms or to be raised in a drug filled healthy conscious environment.

Are you telling me that marketing being hipster and innovating by buying and apple product to their target audience isn't ""showing you share values with someone else""? Maybe it's just not the idea of ""selling"" in your mind. But it is in practice.

And it is in any dictionary: selling:  To give up or surrender in exchange for a price or reward. Reward could be anything positive for you or someone you share values with.

&#x200B;

> Not necessarily. Sometimes things just survive not because they are good but for other reasons. Ancient civilizations sacrificed virgins because they thought it gives them a better harvest or to get an imaginary gods goodwill. That went on for centuries. I am quite sure it had no value. 

Maybe the practice in itself holds no value outside a context, but to them, it kept their society in order and people knew clearly what to expect from each other. Don't judge other societies based only on your current understanding of yours, it is unfair to the old. At best they can say ""they knew no better and gave the best they could"", at worst ""they eventually fall"" proving their specifics of their tradition to not be adapted to a new context.

Giving something for people to believe does create value and bonding within the community, even if the specific practice itself doesn't.

&#x200B;

> **That is maybe the biggest lesson you should take with you: Just because ""something is new"" is an equally bad argument as ""something is old"".** 

I completely agree on that. But let me elaborate on what I meant by ""Tradition is just as important as Innovation"". You can cherry pick specific innovations and traditions that were really bad by today standards, but that doesn't say anything against the fact that for civilizations to thrive, they need in general Traditions and Innovations. 

We innovated with the nuclear bomb, we innovated with the holocaust, we held traditions to slave people, we held traditions to cut the tip of young men penises.

It seems stupid to us now. However the general rule remains.

Traditions are born out of a sense of needing order in an uncertain world. It could hold no value to someone outside of it, but to the people it binds, it holds tremendous value and they are not derived from the specifics of the tradition. 

If a tradition helps people live in a community, grow their assets, improve the individual and trade with foreigners, you've got a killer tradition and you might as well keep it as long as it works, or some rebels show a better way.

&#x200B;

But the key thing is, it must be a better way. And it must be proven to be better.

Societies that only shun traditions die, and societies that only shuns innovations die.

My point, my main point, that I really didn't think would cause all this fuss was simply: ""You need both, order and chaos, traditions and innovation to grow a prosperous society, the degree of which may depend on the society"".

&#x200B;

Mainly what prompted me to discuss this here is that I wanted to understand why people have a problem with Tradition per se. I'm not saying it is good just because it is old. I'm actually fighting the argument that ""it is bad just because it is old"".

As I said earlier, there are other variables that we don't know it could affect, all I'm saying in this specific issue, is that people have the opportunity to try it with their own kids and their own communities and show the ""normies"" the better way after the kids grow and become healthier, more mentally stable adults and help their community.

""dont matter""? You can't be sure of that.

> Sorry, are you arguing that not forcing people to adhere to gender roles is an attack on the people who choose to? 

No I'm not. I'm not arguing to forcing anything. I'm arguing quite the opposite. I'm arguing against people trying to force others on how to educate their kids on gender. It's just that now people mostly educate with the normal gender roles and feel better that way, that's the way they know.

I'm arguing against telling this people they are horrible people and are just opressing their kids and maintaining the ""patriarchy"". I'm arguing against politics influencing how people individually raise their kids.

Tradition is there because it made it better for survival than the alternative. It holds value evidently. It might be losing value, and it might decay, but if one thing is intact through time, it does hold some value, or at least something to learn from.

Bashing things just because it is Tradition is something I've seen in my day to day life. ""Oh you believe that because your father believed that?"" hell if that makes my life and the community around me better, why not?

There has been a turn into how people think in this century, people are indeed turning from valuing their elders and their fathers to a culture of what is new is best just because it is new.

That is what happens in every generation, but ours managed to turn it 1000000% with the power of the internet.

Alright, let me elaborate on that on my specific opinion, although my overall point is on the allowance of judgment in society not on specifically gender roles.

**Gender Roles:**

What I would call ideal scenario(or what I'll try to do to my kids one day) is enforcing the kid on the gender roles assigned by their biological sex, and be accepting if the kid by itself while growing shows a preference for the opposite. Because by then you are educating your kid to follow the norm and be accepted by the large majority, which is nice, because it will have more opportunities to socialize.

But if it doesn't show that inner aspiration for their gender role, than I'd be accepting of it and teach it how to manifest that to the world in the best possible way( not going into places it doesn't know and directly challenge others on it, which is an extreme scenario). That is my strategy to any difference the kid will have with the social norm, if it is more of a nerd, or more of an introvert, gay, holds more liberal thinking against drugs.

Anything that wouldn't be considered ""normal"" by the general public, I would advise my kid to first get their faith in themselves before trying to say to everyone how wrong they are in living their life(which is what I did before to extroverts when I was younger, I wasn't very accepting of the fact that some people want and feel better being surrounded by large amounts of people, I was different and didn't know how to deal with it, but now I know that accepting is the better way).

&#x200B;

**On Punishment**

>Socially, legally, or economically treat folks who conform to whatever tradition differently than folks who don’t.

Well, I don't think, by the legal definition of fair, it is fair to treat humans differently because of anything other than their compliance with the current law. If the law changes, then their judgment will be different.

Economically is harder to say, some people prefer to trade with people they know and respect. Capitalism has turned that more or less irrelevant in most cases, but it is still a strong human drive to only connect and trade with whom they trust.

Capitalism has helped in the way of saying ""if you believe that this money holds value and everyone around me does as well, than we can trade even if I don't know you. You give me X for my product A just like someone of my family/group/etc"".

Now, I don't believe people should be treated differently economically because of what they believe. In that we agree I believe.

The thing where we might disagree is socially. You can't really control society without having it have the same values. The moment you bring people with different conflicting values and don't allow them to manifest their opinions in a civil manner, than what you have is high rate of terrorist attacks from the far-right that we've seen in many countries.

I agree on judging ideas. People who hold their ideas and are willing to change their mind should be rewarded, and should be valued.

If you define yourself within a group, than you can't separate yourself from your ideas, and that breeds non productive conflict in our society as of now.

&#x200B;

>So what? Who says chaos is bad?

Chaos in itself isn't bad. But order isn't either. Everything has good and bad in them. In the financial sector chaos is the stock market(by definition it is a second order chaotic system), and ""safe"", fixed rate investments represent order.

Sure there are exceptions to that analogy, but just bear with me.

No one in their right mind would recommend you to be 100% investing in stocks. That is because chaos in uncertainty. And just like humans thrive on some level of uncertainty but not complete, societies do the same. Some risk is good and  in fact necessary to help both someone or a society grow.

&#x200B;

Humans living in complete chaos cannot recover, even with therapeutic help, there is a point in life that it is truly non return. No matter how much you take your meds, try to organize your life, sometimes life is just truly horrible. You take more punches and kicks when you are down that you can even count.

That is complete chaos, it doesn't allow grow, and only decays.

Now I think it's bad complete and utter decay both for an individual and for a society. Things go really bad when chaos runs without any leash.

&#x200B;

>How so? Are you suddenly unable to continue abiding whatever traditions?

If one tradition is repeatedly attack it will fall, and with it all it's followers. Can you imagine 3 billion people with access to nuclear weapons and tanks, in command positions to after 40 or 50 years believing god exists, have their beliefs crushed over night after repeated attacks from either someone in the alt right(against Muslims) or alt left(against Christianity).

Religions have a point to them, they helped people over millennia to trade and trust each other when the state wasn't powerful enough (if you don't pay me then you also believe you are going to hell for it and pay for eternity, and you don't want that, so I can trust you). While now the thinking is ""if you don't pay me, the state will but you under a black list, take away your credit score and make you eventually pay me back"".

Right of now, religion still has a point to give people something to aim for and to be good to each other(at least people from the same religion, which is in itself no easy or little task).

&#x200B;

>They’re very real scaremongering. Folks said it would cause horrible social unrest to let women vote, or black people be in the same train car as white people, or let gay people serve in the military. We aren’t as reliant on tradition for “order” as you think.

You do agree that we are reliant on **some** order. And that which you said is correct also to point out that the current system was **improved** by change, not completely eradicated(women can vote, instead of there is no election and now we have an empress ).

&#x200B;

Again I said in this thread, I think I can be reasonable to propose some numbers of the degree of order and we can disagree on the number, not on the fact that we need order (and chaos by the way).

&#x200B;

As I said in the beginning "" Tradition is **as** Important **as** Innovation"".  Order is **as** important **as** Chaos."
changemyview,fo7fhxc,t1_fo79u68,1587577453.0,"Alright, let me propose 4 scenarios here, and let me see if we can come to some new conclusions.

&#x200B;

Let's analyze the next systems accordingly to only one variable that I'll call **accuracy**.

&#x200B;

1 - Scenario: Extreme Conservatism

You have system A, that started with 50% accuracy, that is good, not bad for what you want. After a while you get it running for 78% accuracy. That is amazing. You don't want another system ever again. No future changes are necessary.

&#x200B;

2 - Scenario: Conservatism

Same system A, now working at 78%. You decide you want to improve it a bit, maybe change some of the original plans.

You start building system B, and get it working in parallel to system A, and in a smaller scale. So you can test faster and improve faster as well.

Once you get it to 79% and know it can grow even better than that, you decide to replace system A and start using system B and keeping improving on the outside.

&#x200B;

3 - Scenario: More Liberal

Same system A, working 78%, same ol same ol. You now want drastic changes and want to improve very fast, because it is not ideal.

You add one more variable to system A and monitor it while system A is working. It is a payout, and if you are careful you can improve in scale and relatively safe. You change things while they are in production, and the most risky changes you do on a separate system.

Let's call that this case's system B.

&#x200B;

4 - Scenario: Extreme Liberal

System A has 22% error rate, that is unacceptable, we must change now.

&#x200B;

We build a System B that theoretically could surpass system A by miles in almost every direction. We haven't tested if because it can only be tested if we replace the systems. But we believe that is the best course of action.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Now, there are many cases in between, I tried to only say the most obvious ones.

The thing is, for every case, there is an opportunity for it to be used. I'd say case 4 would most likely be used by startups Pivoting out of desperation. Or countries changing their economic infrastructure because it is going bankrupt fast.

For case 1 I'd say it would work, before capitalism. When your business or country depends on growth to keep alive, you can't just be conservative, it is suicide.

&#x200B;

But mostly, what I think is reasonable is to propose things more in terms of Scenario 2 and 3. 

My point of view on the subject is, I'd say System A would be capitalism, and accuracy would be the number of people above poverty line and making enough money to give education to their kids.

System B would be any alternative that goes against what capitalism is.

I haven't heard of a system that better grows money and resources out of this planet and managed to bring people out of poverty **faster** over long term. Yes you can list many bubble crashes, but the difference between the amount of value human beings produce before and after capitalism is huge.

And as you create more value, even people down in the hierarchy benefit from it. Most people in the world have refrigerators, access to education, medicine, food, water, shelter, even internet. Can you imagine being a rich king in the 1500s? You'd hate it compared to what you have now.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not in favor of pure capitalism, I'd put myself on quadrant 3 most of the time. I know capitalism in itself isn't a moral system of values and neither it cares if people have food, water, etc. But it is a system that allows other systems to be built on top of.

That's my 3 cents.

What do you think?"
changemyview,fo7cp0q,t1_fo781aa,1587576088.0,"Alright, you asked ""If a society isn't judgmental, why is it worse than one that is? "".

I can see how I didn't make myself clear. I'm not saying things in absolute, there should be a degree of judgment in society, because else, values could change so rapidly that people would be lost. In much the same way high rates of inflation cripple a society.

Maybe we won't agree on the degree o judgment, but I think it is reasonable to propose some numbers, like 80% of judgment of new values and 20% of free change. The numbers could vary depending on the society and how risk averse it can be.

&#x200B;

> It seems like this view is inherently contradictory. If you are allowed to say anything you want, then I am allowed to say anything I want — *including* putting a negative label on what you say.  

And you are correct in pointing that out, thank you.

However, if I may ask, would you say, erasing judgment from society is something to aim at? If so, why?

If not, would you agree with my point on the ""degree"" of judgment instead of complete or lack of judgment?"
changemyview,fo7c1pb,t1_fo7373q,1587575776.0,"Alright, I can attend to each point separately, but I'd like to know first if you agree that extreme situations are not helpful to society.

Both extreme chaos and order can and will make a society decay.

Can we follow from that premise?"
changemyview,fo73mlx,t1_fo724o8,1587571661.0,"What do you mean by judgmental exactly?

Can you paint a clear picture to me? Because I think we mean different things and might actually agree on some points.

&#x200B;

My view is as simple as that. ""Judgmental"" shouldn't be a bad word, people should be allowed to judge, as they naturally do, and be able to engage in debates on controversial topics allowed to say ""I think the way you live your life is wrong for the majority of the population"" without getting beat up by people who disagree with them.

&#x200B;

We call those people that say those ""nasty"" things judgmental, but the people who beat them up are just as judgmental.

&#x200B;

I am an advocate of people saying whatever the hell they want, and be allowed to do so without such a negative label printed on them.

Judgment shouldn't be a bad word.

It is how we measure each other to one's ideal, because without an ideal there is no growth.

The ideal can chance, as it is doing now, but society should judge if the new ideal is something to aspire to. And if it isn't for one way or another, it should be allowed to say ""I think that is wrong"".

&#x200B;

What I'm fighting here is for the right for people to say ""you are wrong and we aren't following your ideals"", and do so in large scale.

&#x200B;

That can hurt some people's feelings (a right-wing person inside a largely left-wing classroom) or a left-wing fighting for LGBT+ rights in their own household.

&#x200B;

But they, in saying something that the majority disagrees with, should be judged.

That is what they are putting themselves against.

&#x200B;

You speak something different than what others think, you will be judged harshly for it. And that is okay, and accepting that it is okay is the first step to start having more civil debates."
changemyview,fo726uf,t1_fo6xxo0,1587570934.0,">“It would be harder without rigid enforcement of social norms”

I never said that. What I did is that people should be judged.

>But folks who don’t want to shouldn’t be punished for it.

And again, judging isn't punishing. One implies another, but I haven't got to the point of where I proposed ways to punish.

What do you mean by punish exactly?

&#x200B;

> How does it harm you for traditions to be broken? 

When you go into a world that had a certain order, and it gets broken down. Suddenly you are in a lawless place until a new order arrives. Destroying all western tradition could severely impact the majority of people who follow it. 

Civil War, crime rates climbing, and small scale anarchy are very real threats."
changemyview,fo71zh2,t1_fo6y3js,1587570831.0,Sorry I didn't understand your question. Could you phrase it another way?
changemyview,fo711mi,t1_fo6zmyu,1587570359.0,"That is an interesting view.

When I say Chaos I mean lack of order. Not having clear gender roles creates more chaos in that two people will need to discuss more each others roles in a relationship, they have less common values to go from. It is not necessarily good or bad. 

Depends on what you value. If you value efficiency in dealing with relationships, having two people agreeing in something at the beginning without having to say a word, having clear established views on what the other partner should bring to the table is a plus.

If you value a discuss-centered relationship that you build things from scratch(or at least with less order, which is what I like) then you'd prefer not to be in some gender default role.

What I'm trying to point out, is that for the majority of people it works for them, at least for now. And they shouldn't be bashed for saying ""I'd like my wife to be a housewife and work in the kitchen"". Just like people who don't adhere shouldn't be bashed either.

\--------------------------

Now on mental illnesses, we come from two different axioms.

Mine is that lack of order can generate mental illnesses that wouldn't otherwise manifest. Which is the approach of behavior psychologists. You act out into the world in small steps and see if it makes you life better. 

And most times people with depression and similar illnesses tend to get better not by taking antidepressants, but by bringing order in their lives. Waking up everyday at the same time. Doing small things around the house that makes their situation at least 0.1% better everyday.

&#x200B;

From what I understood, and correct me if I'm wrong, your positioning is that people with mental illnesses haven't been given attention before because they were judged by it negatively by society, and that encompasses the large amount of people with mental illnesses.

  
While mine is that the large amount of people with mental illnesses today came from the lack of order that secularism and nowadays society brought.

&#x200B;

Everyone is going to face those things soon or later in life. Maybe not the ""no one belongs anywhere"", the most normal of humans(the larger groups that follow the same rules) tend to not be confronted with that fact long enough even if they do it sometimes.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry for your suffering, people shouldn't mock others because they are weird accordingly to their opinion. But, that is what humans are biologically designed to do.

&#x200B;

We are designed to fill disgust and anger towards others that don't follow the same rules that we do. It is what caused wars among countries and between empires following different religions.

&#x200B;

We feel safe inside an environment where everybody follows the same rules, because if else, what reason do I have to trust you won't betray me after I turn my back? If you also don't believe in after life, or in the judicial system?

&#x200B;

Outside society's norms there is no guarantee that two humans will cooperate. Inside it though, you have a 99% chance that a random person could cooperate with you using money or other mind constructs that everyone believes.

&#x200B;

Now to my point, it sucks to be a feminine guy, and in some places it is dangerous to portray that. And that can and does cause long lasting trauma in individuals.

But that is the chance that nature is willing to take. It is willing to create some individuals that diverge from the norm. Because that is how species evolve. The downside of that is that those individuals have the most amount of pressure on them, to prove to others that their unusual way is better than the traditions.

&#x200B;

You didn't chose to be born like this. But since you are different, by default you have to tread more carefully. Because your way disrupts the norm. Just like Galileo was sent to the fire because of his unusual ways, or Socrates.

&#x200B;

Unusual is disliked, we can create a society that respects it, but never accept without question.

It is unfortunate. I stand with you in this. Internet is there to help us find a smaller community where our ways aren't wrong by default and we can find some peace in our lives.

&#x200B;

But I'm afraid those pressures won't ever stop. Either we learn to live with them, hiding when we must, and showing strength when we can, and accepting when there's nothing we can do.

Or we don't.

That could also induce him into the path of ""since it's just chemical reactions, what I had with her has no meaning, so why try again in the future? Everything is gonna end and on and on..."".

I thought it was important to show also that love can be maintained way past the emotional high.

Because then, it can lead the OP towards a different path, the path of learning more about partners before fully commiting again, the path of maturity that comes from understanding that it will take effort, but with the right kind of person, it could be worth it.

If you can, schedule a time to recover, so you can return more rested and able to help more.

We all love you and congratulate you on your work so far. Don't beat yourself down. You are a hero.

If you are completely overwhelmed right now and can't stop, or feel you can't stop. We want you to know we care for you and want to see you well just like you want to help others.

&#x200B;

We love you. Thank you for existing. Take your time if you can."

selfhelp,fm11stk,t3_fs978x,1585670416.0,"Forget motivation.

Start following pain.

Vipassana could teach you that.(those 10 day retreats are the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but it sure teaches you).

Or trying David goggins methods as well.

The important thing is to learn to do things even when you are not in the mood for them.

Actually it means doing your best work when you are in the worst condition for that.

Do the most when least motivated.

Pain."
SuicideWatch,fm0m27x,t3_fs8yhf,1585661278.0,"The mind becomes colored with their thoughts.

I understand how you are feeling, I've had this vision for my life as well.

I was to become rich, lonely 50 year old, do drugs and die.

But, since I started making real friends, and started therapy, it's like there is a 10% chance, or something small, that I'd live a good life.

It's not hope, I would say that now I can see other options.

And it's just such a refreshing thought."

Before that all the books my school gave me were really just romance and story about characters that I could care less.

I wasn't interested in feelings and stuff.

But then, as I picked up Sherlock Holmes, damn, books could teach me how to think and be exciting stories as well."
