Chaos appears with a loud voice

The spectrum is flying above nothing

Loud in our head like a mental illness

In a few days our pop idle has disappeared

I wasn't there from the beginning

We just forgot who we are

From the golden tower

Open a dark and dirty passage leading to another dimension

Everything changed forever

Michael, because of you

Because of your intense desire"

Assistance,fas28ua,t1_far89np,1576322675.0,"Hey there! I'm actually surprised that people cared about my problems. It's a rough pay period, and I haven't got a job. I get 350€ monthly as student scholarship. My parents give me between 50-100€ every month. They live in Paris and I am in Toulouse, which is quite far away.

This makes me 400-450€ every month. 
Rent is about 300€/month (only for 9 square meters...)
50€ goes to my ISP. 30€ monthly because of student loan debt.

I have to get by every month with 20€-70€.
It is an even rougher period of pay the 8th December was my birthday and I payed a train ticket to get to my friend's a few hundred miles away.

Usually 70€ is just enough, and I go to social services when it's not.

There is so much things I'd like to buy myself. When I moved here I had nothing but clothes. To this day I still have only one plate, one fork, one knife, one spoon... I found a microwave on the streets last month, I'm happy to have it. 

I think I'll try to get a job eventually. Part-timer at McDonald's, or something like that. Everyone has to start somewhere."
