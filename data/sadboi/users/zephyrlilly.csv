Sometimes when I read a title that gives pure asshole vibes, I have to remember that titles can be misleading. It’s almost always proven to be wrong.

This is pure, 100% asshole territory and the fact that you have to ask this question, to validate your spoiled perceptions and need to hurt someone who probably went through a lot of hell, shows you need some actual life experience.

Also, kinda want to let you know: the world doesn’t revolve around you and the sun doesn’t rise when you open your eyes every morning.

Do you know anything about her past? Do you know anything about why she was adopted? Do you know anything about her as a person? Coming from someone who spent time in foster care, who had a terribly childhood that left scars - physical and mental - i can tell you her past probably isn’t pretty. I doubt your parents went out and found some random girl on the streets and said “Hey, you know that child we have at home? I think we need an upgrade because that kid ain’t good enough.” They probably thought: “Hey, we have so much love to share, I want to share it with this girl who obviously needs it because she has not been shown enough.”

Do you have to like her? No. That’s fine. What you do not get to do is be an absolute cunt to her. The world has already done that.

My mom’s parents partially raised me and my cousins and I are all mixed the same (weird to say) but the issues I’ve experienced have been between my dad’s parents and myself. They never liked my mother and by association, me. When my dad died, they effectively stopped talking to me which was hard at 4. My mother tried but they just didn’t want to. I have two older half sisters from his first marriage, and out of everyone to show my kindness, it was his ex wife. I believe she even babysat me which she and my mother didn’t get along but she saw how happy I made her daughters. She even has my picture up in her home.

I didn’t realize any of this until my twenties. Because I didn’t have contact, I never noticed and I went through so much shit as a kid that my other family didn’t cross my mind much. But it became so obvious when I was older. That realization in my twenties hurt but it was so much easier to handle because of my situation.

I don’t know how to vote because your daughter is going to realize it at some point, she’s going to be hurt no matter what. I feel like at this time, it’s too soon to tell. There is still a chance she could come around. But that’s my being hopeful. I also understand that it might not be a chance.

A few weeks later, he found it and just said oops. It had a shoe print and a coffee stain on it.

Another time, I got a test back and noticed that it wasn’t properly graded so I took it up to him and let him know. Before that, he placed the answer key on the board and I wrote down all the write answers so I could figure it out at home and he noticed all the correct answers with no work and thought he messed up and started completely regrading it. I didn’t want to pass that way so I let him know I only needed correction for two problems.

He was unhelpful that the class before mine actually locked him out of the room when he left because they didn’t need his help - that one is just funny to me. Someone even tried to break out through the window. My class was on the second floor.

What really annoyed me was at the end of my freshman year, I was so sick that I missed all of my finals. Every year, my high school ended on a half day so that people could empty lockers and sign yearbooks. I had to go in, still super sick, and take my finals. For his class, we had to turn in a work sheet that we would get back. He couldn’t find mine so he gave me a “comparable” worksheet from another student. This student failed the worksheet, I did not.

How is your mother giving you grief over something she essentially did? That’s just wrong. I mean, it might be a legal thing only because he was there longer than a month but he didn’t even have your permission to live there so I’m sure legality is out of the window.

I live in a weird maze of an apartment complex and I put in instructions because no one who doesn’t live there knows where my building is. I will say that it is the easiest building to find when you read the instructions. I put instructions in every order but some of them don’t read them and some of them do (the ones who do thank me) but the ones who ignore them, some have actually yelled at me because they took a left instead of a right and I rate them accordingly. You’re not an asshole because they don’t want to read the instructions."

I realize this post is a bit old but I really hope you see this and why I’m saying you shouldn’t feel like an asshole at all because of this.

I am Bipolar type II. I was diagnosed as that last year after trying to kill myself. I don’t get manic episodes too often but I do get severely depressed to the point where I didn’t leave my bed for six months, I dropped 50 lbs, I didn’t care if I lived or died. I’m not saying that’s what you went through, just explaining my experience. It started like most, diagnosed with depression when I was 19, diagnosed as mildly bipolar at 21, diagnosed as Type 2 at 28. They gave me seroquel then because lithium is expensive and all it made me do is sleep. I also have the hardest time sticking to medications.

Basically, that doctor is very uninformed in my opinion. Bipolar disorder isn’t a straight diagnosis. Some people are very manic, some people are very depressed, some people have a balance, and some people vary. You can’t just look at a person and say “You’re not this. Try this.” You need to try things out, you need to rule things out and test things. Being diagnosed as Bipolar was not a quick process for me, it took a week in a mental health facility, it took two weeks to be diagnosed as type 2. When I read information about it, it was like I finally understood myself again.

Also, just like finding a therapist takes time, finding a doctor that you can trust and understand you takes time. And any doctor, again in my opinion, who would guilt you about seeking help when they weren’t being helpful to begin with shouldn’t be allowed to see patients. It’s people like that you who give a stigma to these disorders. It hurts me. I wouldn’t have been so against my own treatment if it weren’t for people like that.

I really hope you are still feeling better. I hope everything makes sense again - I don’t know how to phrase that better - but you’re not alone and you’re not an asshole. The doctor is."

1. Her not wearing something for a while doesnt mean she doesn’t want it anymore. So don’t sell it.
2. People are allergic to silver. I’m allergic to fake silver chains and real gold. Don’t be so narrow minded.
3. “You’re stuff is my stuff.” This is the biggest controlling and manipulative bullshit I’ve ever heard and you need to get something through your tiny brain - JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP DOESNT MEAN SHE OR HER THINGS ARE YOUR POSSESSION TO DO WITH AS YOU PLEASE. If that’s your literal thought process, I hope she realizes she can do better.
4. Seek some help because the rest of this reads as someone with an entitlement complex and you might want to fix that before she leaves you for someone who treats her with RESPECT.

Wow, the kid who probably had a horrible first four years of his life wants to be around the only person he’s ever known as a true family constantly? Like he might have some actual issues that being around you makes him feel better? And now you’re going to devalue that and minimize him just because he’s a bit “odd” because he doesn’t “fit in?” 

What the actual fuck is wrong with you?

As a person who spent time in foster care, whose own family did some horrible shit that made me a bit clingy to those I love and care about, I hope you realize how fucking entitled and pathetic you are. 

Your brother is too good for you. He can do better than you. You’re the one in your family who doesn’t belong.

Your parents realized they had enough love to share with someone who probably hadn’t felt any love in their early years and it seems you want to destroy that.

I get some siblings don’t get along, biological or adopted, but I’d never heard anyone try and take a claim or family away before."

I feel like this is the main reason why people shouldn’t have children until they’re ready and that means in all the ways: financially, mentally, and the like. This will only go wrong because it isn’t your responsibility to care for their child. It’s very irresponsible of them to bring in a child right now for them - not saying they wouldn’t love the child but a child needs more than love to survive."

I know it’s extreme and she will hate you but this isn’t normal behavior for a bipolar person who just doesn’t want to be married anymore. Something has snapped in her brain. And you need to take this into your own hands via a police welfare check. She won’t have a choice and she can get the help that she needs.

I say this as a person whose former-partner did this because even after our break up, I wasn’t acting like myself. I may hate him for other reasons but not for that.

She shouldn’t be on her own in this state. Even if she were to leave, it’s not going to turn out well for her in the end."

Now, my name is very unique, I’m the only me on Facebook, so he found me and requested me and just waited for me to add him. I didn’t do it until a week later because I wasn’t the brightest.

because we have something in common: childhood insomnia. It’s still an issue for me sometimes but I’m able to trick myself to sleep.

I had to take medication as a child for ADHD and because I never slept as a child, my mother got me put on sleep medication. I’m pretty sure it’s also an allergy medication now, Benadryl, so I also didn’t know I had allergies until high school because I took it every night to sleep. Sometimes children need medication to sleep. And it’s not like you’re giving her hardcore drugs, just following a doctor’s orders and giving her medication so she can sleep through the night which is the best thing for a growing child. He’s the one placing her in a room where she can’t sleep and she’s probably annoyed about it."

When I got engaged, he got so excited because he wanted five groomsmen and I burst into tears because I have one friend.

I have one friend and two sisters, one of which is addicted to heroin currently. I have my mother who was surprised when I said I would want her to walk me down the aisle if I were to get married. But my then-fiance has friends, family, so many people he couldn’t count on to be there and I have one friend and my mother.

Now, we didn’t get married but the guy I was with before him knew I had no one and - if we were to take the step - knew I’d want a small wedding, maybe at the courthouse, because he knew I wasn’t close to my family and that I only had one true friend.

I know it would be hard but it’s a conversation that needs to be had of what kind of wedding you’d both want. Don’t let it to deter you from popping the question. The only thing that matters is you and her. Truthfully."
