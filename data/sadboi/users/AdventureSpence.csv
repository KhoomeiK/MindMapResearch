yugioh,extyg7e,t3_cuflek,1566576771.0,"I played through the OG campaign til I unlocked Kaiba packs and went hard on Thunder Dragons. Probably not the easiest deck to start off with, but since most of the necessary drags are commons in the packs it didn't take too long at all. Even an underpowered T Drags deck is enough to wipe the floor with most of the campaign duels. To bring the deck to full power, start opening Jack Atlas packs for some batterymen and then grandpa til you have at least one some summer summoner. Finally got my deck to (basically) full power last night and boy does it feel good."

Also, kudos to you for being able to save and drop 400 bucks on a deck. When I was fifteen I spent all my money on weed and played jank 24/7, so you're doing better than I was."

Damnthatsinteresting,esunqg4,t1_esujrz1,1562286200.0,"Statistics are far from infallible, especially when based off of self-reported information instead of simple random sampling, but the fact is that they provide no context as to why pitbulls have a statistically higher number of attacks than other breeds (which you would know if you actually bothered to skim the article I linked.) 

Another example of statistics being skewed by personal and environmental bias is the incarceration rates of minorities in the US compared to that of caucasians. If you check out the link below, maybe you will realize just how important context is in real life and how statistics can be misconstrued.

Either way, I'm in a shit mood tonight and it's fairly obvious that arguments with random redditors never actually do anything but set people more into their own personal biases, so I hope you have a pleasant rest of your night.

Damnthatsinteresting,esuijxr,t1_esuff9n,1562284031.0,"Damn, did your grandma teach you that? People talk a lot of shit about Pitbulls, but at the end of the day it's just a dog. Pitbulls aren't inherently vicious, and no, their jaws dont lock on like a fucking alligator. Any large, athletic dog can kill you if its raised to be a killer. It's not inherently a ""killer breed"", it's just a dog, and the dangerous pitbulls were made that way by the shitty humans that mistreated them.

Overwatch,eq93nim,t1_eq9180x,1559884843.0,"Again, you seem to be assuming that you can't improve your APM given time and practice. And yes, the Hanzo point was a little hyperbolic but the point still stands. One skill isn't enough to make someone good at an RTS, or overwatch, but tactile skills can be improved with practice and persistence. 


Honestly, that fact that you can assume that Person B wins in this imagined scenario every time tells me that you haven't spent much time with the genre. I'm slow as hell but I still manage to hold my own. Macros, practice, and pure game time can make up for a lack of APM. 

Besides, I think you are totally oversimplifying what ""everything else"" is. APM and strategy are intrinsically linked. You have to make split second decisions based on what situation presents itself. You can APM yourself right into a corner and still get yourself killed. I'm sorry, but your argument is just a strawman fallacy.

Alright, I've said my piece and I'm fucking tired. Good talk, hope you have a good night."
Overwatch,eq90j6p,t1_eq8zjx3,1559881374.0,"Which can be improved with practice. Nobody said it was easy, but the fact remains that APM itself isn't what matters if you dont know WHICH actions to perform. 

You're on the Overwatch subreddit btw, so compare APM to your accuracy. Accuracy can be practiced and improved, but if accuracy is the only skill that matters then we should all just play hanzo and widow"
Overwatch,eq8xs5u,t1_eq8wv78,1559878655.0,"That's.... blatantly untrue. APM is just a measurement of how many actions you perform in a given time (duh) but it doesn't necessarily translate to skill. 

I can hit 10000 APM on my keyboard if I roll my face on it, but somehow I don't think I'll be winning any starcraft matches. The RTS genre is first about outhinking your opponent, and then about how quickly you can manage to do that. But you have to actually think first"
