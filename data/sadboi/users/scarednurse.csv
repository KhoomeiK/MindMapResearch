I follow subs like this because as someone who works in GI and also has an actual GI disease, I like to know what dx people gravitate towards when it comes to munchie stuff because it almost always tends to be GI related, and I run into quite a bit of vague-dxing in my field... 

That being said, I cannot believe the amount of people on here who claim to have reflux and slow gastric emptying and other issues with the upper GI tract, yet are able to eat common upper GI irritants. THC or no, chocolate is an awfully intense irritant, so I don't really get how this girl claims it helps her? At face value I also know that not every patient is identical in their response to treatment, but chocolate is a pretty classic, across the board GI irritant. Also, typically such intense opioid analgesics are contraindicated for treatment of medical-based GI issues because, y'know... It decreases motility. My guess is, sadly, the motility issues have nothing to do with a primary gastric emptying disorder and is instead probably secondary to the use of (what looks like) various CNS depressants. 

I hope she can get actual help. I think if mental health treatment was less stigmatized these people would likely get help for somatic symptom disorder much sooner (which causes - you guessed it - GI issues)."
