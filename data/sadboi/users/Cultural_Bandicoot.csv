AskReddit,fj9jpqb,t3_fc5xl7,1583151058.0,"not sure if its sold anywhere else, but here in the UK there's a soft drinks company called Rubicon, various tropical flavours, lychee, mango, passion fruit. 

2008 I had a pretty bad addiction to sleeping pills (zopiclone) which I was given after anti depressants (prozac) made me go nuts and unable to sleep properly. obviously I started abusing them after about a week, then my monthly prescription would only last like 5 days, so I started ordering that shit online and popping them like tic tacs, 3 months in I was eating half a pack a day, within 9 months I was taking 25+ 7.5mg tablets daily.

the pills give you this weird metallic taste in the back of your throat after about 20 minutes when it starts working and that was my high, soon as one was wearing off id pop another and after 20 minutes i got the best feeling ever, never been able to replicate it, even the best sex ive ever had never matched it. 

I ALWAYS drank rubicon passion fruit with it, the guy in the corner shop near me would let me buy a whole case and id just be going through them bitches with the pills. when i stopped the pills even the thought of that drink made me feel sick, tried it once after and almost threw up because it reminded me of the taste of the pills. thankfully i can still have the lychee and mango."
