lonely,fr26sr5,t3_gm4rkq,1589832126.0,"Well, for me the reason I don’t have close friends is because I’m just not that compatible with the very few people that I know. Or so I’ve concluded anyway. Opening up to someone is not sufficient for close friendships, they may not open up to you very much, or even if they pretend to care they really won’t. Even if they genuinely do care, maybe they don’t care enough.

I don’t know. I think it’s luck, really. Finding the people you click with. Though I’ve been looking for about 28 years and still no luck."
lonely,fqzfmee,t3_glnlma,1589766357.0,"I honestly can’t relate, no, sorry. Not to say I have it worse than you, it’s not a contest, but I would kill for the extent of social interaction that you get on a daily basis.

Once corona is under control and people can start going out again, you can hang out more with your friends IRL at least. Just stay tough till then I suppose."
lonely,fqzfb7r,t1_fqxsw7m,1589766167.0,"Sometimes, it’s not pressure from others that crushes you, it’s the pressure from within. You feel it in your bones that you crav- no, need meaningful friendships. Being deprived of that could make anyone go insane - that’s why solitary confinement is such a terrible punishment and reserved only for the most heinous of criminals"
lonely,fqzf55z,t3_glgpwz,1589766067.0,"Yeah. I know what you mean. Almost like the vacuum cleaner guy from Breaking Bad.

I think a change of scenery could be good for anyone if their life is getting too stagnant and isolating. Start fresh, in a city where nobody knows you, hence nobody has any negative perception of you."
depression,fqzdx7b,t1_fns2lol,1589765337.0,"It’s not fair if someone always prefers the receiving treatment. It’s somewhat analogous to someone who never gives birthday presents, but expects presents on their own birthday. It’s selfish, imo.

I know there are people who do not need as much social interaction to be happy, and those people might not be inclined to reach out as much, but in general, it’s kind of shitty if only one party is putting in almost all the effort.

Unfortunately, this happens really often, esp in my case. It drains you mentally, makes you feel like shit. It’s even worse than if you had not reached out to begin with."

lonely,fqsvxzt,t3_gknw5c,1589620818.0,"Good luck. I’m kind of the opposite, I have a girlfriend but don’t have a single other close friend and it is utter TORTURE. I feel so isolated."
depression,fqqojm9,t3_gkb5ka,1589569143.0,"This is so so relatable. Other than my long distance gf, I barely have anyone to talk to. This was the case before the coronavirus also. Oh well, I guess complaining about it doesn’t help.

I guess you just gotta like accept the things you can’t change, like how other people perceive you. Focus your attention on things you enjoy so those negative lonely thoughts dont torture you. It’s really hard, and the ideal situation is to of course have a close circle of friends to at least talk to. Barring that, you’d have to meet new people but cause of covid most public social events are cancelled or postponed :("

Think of it it this way though - at least you have a close female friend!

lonely,fqf1a9b,t3_gi90vw,1589317040.0,"I know what you mean. In fact, I feel the pain coming from your narrative, because I feel that same pain. I **constantly** get the feeling that something is wrong with me. I don't really have much of a sense of humour, either. In fact, I have no idea what I've got going for me. My therapist says I am ""kind"" and ""compassionate"", and maybe that's true to an extent, I don't know.

I'm not gonna give you generic advice like ""oh you should try getting new hobbies and checking out clubs and events"", because you've heard it a million times. I've done these things and they still haven't helped me develop anything beyond mere acquaintanceship. I will say, though, that there is **absolutely nothing wrong with you**. You do not believe me, I'm sure. In fact, even I have a hard time believing that there's nothing wrong with me. But it's true. It's not that anything is wrong with you, it's that something (or many things) are wrong *for* you. It's not your fault that your ex-friends are jerks to you. I'm completely serious about this. You don't deserve to be treated that way, even if your social skills were hypothetically less than perfect. No one deserves to be treated like shit by friends and family. No one deserves to be alone and isolated. And you *certainly* don't deserve to be ignored by your peers.

I know this probably isn't much help. I have enormous social issues myself, owing to several years of ongoing depression. Feeling people slip through my fingertips by the day, it's awful. Let me know if you want someone to talk to, otherwise well.. good luck I suppose. <3"

Don’t feel motivated to do anything, honestly. Don’t wanna watch tv or play video games or read, nada.
Don’t feel like applying for jobs.

Don’t want to be myself. I’m torn between who people think I am and who I actually am. Mom doesn’t want to have this discussion with me, and said she would disown me if I ever tried being my true self."

depression,fq2k63g,t3_ggenld,1589056922.0,"I mean this is kind of obvious, but don't compare yourself to others. Most of your friends probably don't even know what it's like to be depressed and/or anxious.

That said, I can relate. I don't feel very good about myself, either. I'm not really good at anything, and I don't even have a lot of friends. I barely get texts from anyone, let alone calls. On top of that, I feel really uncomfortable with who I am as a person.

Just remember that your worth is never relative to that of others. You are a valuable human being; we all are. :)"
depression,fq2jce1,t3_ggbgrc,1589056692.0,"Guys shouldn’t have to feel like they have to hide their emotions from others. Those who believe that men must be “stoic” are imo lingering onto outdated notions of masculinity. Besides, I think it’s completely acceptable for a straight, cis man to be feminine in 2020. Of course, gender nonconformity acceptance in men is still so far away from where we want it to be, but we’re slowly making progress. It’s unfortunate that these norms still exist in the dating world. I think as another redditor put it, we can lighten up the gender roles for both genders."
depression,fq2igf3,t1_fq0rh8d,1589056445.0,"Yeah, that's true. But if you feel really uncomfortable with your body (e.g. gender dysphoria) then it might not be such a bad idea to take at least some action about it. It would help us if we can accept ourselves and our bodies unconditionally, but it's obviously much easier said than done, especially when society always tells us that our bodies are not good enough.

I believe it is a combination of self-acceptance and self-improvement, but definitely emphasis on the self-acceptance."

Those words ring true till this day, and it still hurts.

Honestly, yeah. I always get this feeling that the few ""friends"" I have, none of them actually care about me. In fact, one of them actually kept leaving me on read, and I just got fed up with it so I'm not talking to them anymore.

I think I'm gonna cry guys. :'("

Anyway, I feel lonely among people when I feel left out. I feel left out when... well, I don't know exactly what makes me feel left out. I think it's when I feel like no one seems to notice my existence. Of course, I'm too quiet in social interactions because I'm thinking that no one in the group likes me. It's a really vicious cycle.

This is why I vastly prefer 1 on 1 interactions."

I can really feel your pain in this one sentence alone. I've felt this too, especially during elementary school. I didn't have a single friend in my school. And even in high school, I got along with a few other weirdos, but the girls never wanted to be friends with me. It really destroyed my self confidence even though I don't think I'm particularly that ugly."
