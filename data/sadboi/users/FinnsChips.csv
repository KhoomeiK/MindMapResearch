Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs while his Isaac watched Isaac broadcasts on the Isaac. Life was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That it, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac: ""Your Isaac has become Isaaced by Isaac. He needs to be Isaaced"" ""I will do my best to Isaac him my Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, Isaacing into Isaac's Isaac, Isaacing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.
Again the Isaac called to her: ""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to Be Isaac off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac, and confess his Isaacs."" ""I will Isaac your Isaacs Isaac. I have faith in Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she Isaaced Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.
One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac Isaacing to her.
""You've done as I've Isaaced, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac, To Isaac your Isaac, I will Isaac one more Isaac of Isaac."" ""Yes Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac Isaaced.
""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I Isaac a Isaac... Your Isaac Isaac, will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac as an Isaacing to me to prove you Isaac me above all else.""
""Yes Isaac"" She Isaaced, Isaacing a Isaac's Isaac from the Isaac.
Isaac, Isaacing through an Isaac in his Isaac, Isaaced in Isaac. Isaacing around his Isaac to find an Isaacing Isaac, he Isaaced an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he Isaac open the Isaac, just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac, and Isaac himself Isaac, into the Isaac Isaacs below..."

gallifrey,fmkxrej,t3_fv9r1h,1586172612.0,"I have really weird feelings about the Moffat era as a whole. For the most part I'm really not keen on Matt Smith's era or portrayal, I'm not even entirely sure why, it just doesn't do it for me. It felt too gimmicky, relying on catchphrases and quirkiness. Series 5 is decent, 6 is a mess but has some gems, 7 is maybe my least favourite series of NuWho, and in particular I found Smith really unbearable in this particular series. I don't think Smith was bad as the Doctor but to me he's pretty forgettable, even though he was the doctor during my teenage years where I really started getting into the show. I know lots of people like him, which is great, different opinions make life interesting, but he just didn't do it for me.

In terms of companions, I find Amy really unlikeable and abusive to Rory, who is a fucking fantastic companion, maybe the best of the new series, and he deserved so much better. River is good, she's a very controversial character but I like her and the idea behind her is really interesting. Clara with Smith is just a bland nothing though.

When it comes to Capaldi's run, it might be my favourite run of the whole show though. I really don't know how I find such a stark contrast between the Capaldi and Smith eras, their Doctors are certainly polar opposites, but I see a lot of people who think that a lot of 12's era felt like it was being written for 11, and I really don't see it. For me series 8 fixed Clara, got rid of the shitty romance between her and the Doctor that had been hinted at since she showed up, made the stories bearable, and gave us a Doctor that felt perfect for what I wanted in a Doctor, it was kind of unnerving just how perfectly Capaldi fulfilled everything I'd ever wanted in an incarnation of the doctor. Stories like Mummy on the Orient Express, Flatline and Dark Water I adore, other than In the Forest of the Shite I don't think there's a truly bad story in series 8 either. Series 9 I didn't like as much, but it still had Capaldi, Clara was not quite as good as she was in series 8 for me but she was still good, and it felt very much like classic who with the two-parter format giving us longer stories, and I think that worked really well for Capaldi, who is basically just a Classic doctor taken into the new series. I don't really care for Hell Bent and think that Gallifrey could've been used better, but lots of people love it and I don't hate it either. Series 10 might be my favourite of the whole new series, definitely my favourite of the Moffat era. It all just felt perfect to me, Capaldi is at his best, Bill is such a great companion, Nardole is unfortunately the weak link for me, but I'm aware I'm in the minority there, I also really like Michelle Gomez so I'm glad she's such a big part of this series. There isn't a bad episode, though Lie of the Land is kind of close, but then there's The Pilot, Thin Ice, Oxygen, Extremis, and the finale, all of which are brilliant.

Overall it's a mixed era, but I'd definitely say that I think his whole era will be looked back on as one of Who's high points, especially series 5 (which I'm not a big fan of but I'm very much in the minority there), 9 and 10."
