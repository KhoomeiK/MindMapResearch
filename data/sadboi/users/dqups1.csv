Haha I literally measured every part of my body to calculate optimal measurements and angles for everything. I work from home and good ergonomic chairs are crazy expensive and even then I’m not getting everything I want. My theory is how can I get myself just zoned in. My next purchase will probably be bose noise canceling wireless headphones to further dial me in, cancel external noise, play my binaural beats, and also make and receive calls and use my virtual assistant while working hands free. If you’re someone that likes handwriting or takes lots of notes that way I know there’s like smart pens and notebooks out there or even tablets that you can write and it digitalization you’re written notes automatically. I’ve also heard good things about pomodoro timers but I haven’t really put that to use yet.

Yeah I’ve passed levels 1 & 2 of the cfa so far so one more to go. The work experience requirement is 4 years though which stinks so I’ve been waiting on level 3. I’m actually looking to get more into data science and tech right now I think. I just don’t feel I connect with the finance culture very well anymore and think a smaller tech start-up vibe will be much healthier for me in terms of culture. I’d really like to get into entrepreneurship personally though. Thinking bout getting my MBA down the line. If I got back into finance after that it’d probably be VC or I was also considering potentially doing a PhD in applied math after mba and pursuing quant trading. Lol we’ll see where we end up.

Where are you from?"
NeoPotential,fk3sama,t1_fk3py2u,1583844923.0,"That’s awesome. I majored in finance & accounting and have been working in finance for a few years. Have a bunch of friends working at Big 4 and getting their CPAs. I’m working on my CFA myself and then also I just started this online coding bootcamp for data science at the Flatiron school so learning python too. Lol so I can answer questions you have about both. I’m totally in the same boat, looking to become a more productive person. 

In terms of actual learning I came across this site the other day that really focuses on that though I haven’t dived too deep into it. I think the podcasts are free. [Super Human Academy](https://members.superhumanacademy.com/collections)

Other things for learning I could recommend a whole bunch of supplements which I’ve found effective though balancing costs in that area can be a bit of a challenge depending on how much your looking to spend.

Personally, I just bought dual monitors for my laptop and a special ergonomic keyboard that uses a Dvorak layout. The dual monitors are huge for productivity and I never learned to touch type so I’m learning now with my new keyboard.

Something you can do right away is using binaural beats. You can download a binaural beats app for free and try alpha frequency for learning and more beta frequency for focus/doing.

I think working on meditation is huge for harnessing focus and then trying to continue that mindfulness in your work. When you’re more consciously aware of each key stroke, let’s say, you won’t make mistakes and have to double check your work. You just mindfully execute it right the first time even if that takes a touch longer.

One of the things I really struggle with is focus and especially the daily tasks of life i.e. cooking, laundry, bills etc. Other productivity things I’m currently working on are getting all my appointments into a calendar, building a solid morning and bedtime routine and digitalizing all my paper files then setting up a system to deal with new ones. I feel if I can get all my daily life tasks prepared for and scheduled I’ll be able to throw myself into my work more without constantly worrying which I do to compensate for the fact that I forget things.

I’d love to find ways we can work together to push each other further!"

neuro,fk3l5yq,t3_fg7wfo,1583838348.0,"Believe it our not, I actually felt the same way for awhile. I really thought I had a narcissistic personality disorder. It was only a few things that led me to believe that I could feel empathy/love. One was a girlfriend I got in early college, another was an enlightening experience I had, and lastly was getting a dog. Even the dog was often tough to love and empathize with but it helped me more than anything with actively trying every day to better empathize with this creature. It’s a little easier than with a human lol. 

What I realized is that I’m actually quite sensitive and naturally empathic. Those of us that have that trait can often become so overwhelmed with these feelings from/towards others that we turn our empathy off as a coping mechanism. I’m not saying this is you, but it might be something worth looking into. Personally, I believe everyone has the capacity for empathy and I believe a recent study was done on sociopaths that detected in an fMRI that the difference may just be that non-empathy is their default mode as opposed to others. Originally, they showed little empathy as expected but when told to attempt to empathize the brain scan noticed much more activity in the regions for empathy in the brain. 

It seems both from research and personal experience that empathy can be learned. It’s something I now try to actively work on and if empathy is something that’s important to you, I have no doubt you can learn to improve on yours as well."

When you know what the doctor knows don’t you trust yourself to know you better than a stranger?  Unfortunately, most doctors hate this. The trick is finding the one that loves it."
ADHD,fjm07al,t3_fe10mt,1583458564.0,"I would disagree that doctors are necessarily there to help you and are judgement free. There’s definitely judgement at times especially from those more in the medical field than psychiatric. Not too mention almost all doctors are basically judging you constantly to determine if you really are telling the truth or simply drug seeking. Even if you are completely honest then you have the issue in which doctors may still judge your requests, ideas, relevant knowledge, your risk to them and even whether they like or trust you enough to prescribe certain treatments or take you seriously. “Is this patient a hypochondriac that I should dismiss and move on or could there really be something to this?” Often doctors will try to take a babysitter role as well. Many times doctors do these things because, the fact of the matter is, they’re really not always there to help you. They’re there to collect a paycheck and follow whatever business model they see fit to optimize their revenue while managing their risk i.e. malpractice lawsuits, loss of medical license, medical board sanctions and problems with the DEA as well as making sure not to get tripped up over HIPPA compliance or any of the other regulations they have exposure too. 

Despite these various concerns with many many doctors out there, I do believe there are those out there that truly put patients first, always respect them and take seriously any issues, or treatment requests a patient might have. I personally see the doctor as playing two roles, that of the prescriber, surgeon and insurance processor and  that of the advisor. In my opinion, the doctor’s role is to advise you on treatments and diagnoses and then treat you based on YOUR treatment options and YOUR choice of which treatment option you see as best given the doctor’s advise.  I think you will always get the most out of treatment by being as candid as possible with your doctor but finding those that can fit that bill, and in that way, allow you to establish trust in them, can be very difficult. Without trust, it is very difficult to be candid with your doctor. 

Finding a good doctor that does fit this bill is difficult and unfortunately in many cases more expensive as these doctors tend to be private pay. They command higher salaries to compensate them for the additional risk inherent in prescribing in line with their patients wishes. This also allows these doctors additional time that they are able to provide to patients. This additional time enables a more solid relationship with the patient and allows for at length discussions around treatment.

If anyone has any tips on finding good doctors like this I’d love to hear them. I totally agree that having a doctor you can candidly discuss treatment with ultimately yields the best results."

As for phenibut, I’ve probably gone up to 2g at once but I use sporadically, usually in conjunction with adderall. I think if you cycle or don’t use daily you can avoid tolerance build up and dependency on a lot of things. 

I took Xanax for a while daily which the tolerance grew fast and I was dependent within 6 months. Quit cold turkey, took me 2 months to recover then was off benzos for about a year and a half and now I’m able to use it roughly every 3-4 days without tolerance build-up or dependency.

Most light alarms out there aren’t strong enough and even one that’s approved for SAD is only about 10,000 lux compared to the sun’s 100,000 so I’d build my own to compare to that and combine with other sleep technologies such as the aura ring, dreem head band etc."

Supplements,f9zgf2e,t3_e7f4f8,1575741621.0,"Let me start off by saying that I do believe those with mental health issues should see a doctor. I suffer from a few issues myself and have benefited greatly from supplements as well as pharmaceuticals and medical treatments such as neurostimulation, neurofeedback and biofeedback. 

That being said, the reason many people turn to supplements is that there is a serious problem with the medical system in America and it seems many other countries as well. 

The first problem is the extreme regulation that is placed on the testing and approval of new drugs. These drugs take millions of dollars to get approved and many many years. The outrageous cost of approval means promising drugs that are generic, things like tianeptine, racetams, lithium orotate etc. will never be approved because the drug companies are not willing to pay millions of dollars to conduct clinical trials on a generic drug that shows no promise of profit. 

The second problem is the great length of time it takes to get a new drug approved. The average time of approval for a new pharmaceutical approval in the U.S. is roughly 8 years, start to finish. This is 8 years that real people are suffering in great pain and make no mistake, mental health issues are very real and very painful. For these people, years is too long to wait. They need help and they need it now so it’s understandable to see why they might explore experimental or unapproved drugs as well as supplements with a similar mechanism of action to a promising drug that’s currently in clinical trials.

The third problem is the drug approval process and nature of clinical research in general. Many drugs are not approved for not meeting clinical effectiveness standards when anecdotal evidence proves otherwise.  For supplements, the same principal applies with effective treatments not necessarily meeting scientific standards of proven clinical effectiveness. The problem with these studies are that they test a drug or supplement on a group of people and then determine whether or not the average benefit of one group was greater than the average benefit of placebo. In these scenarios, they are measuring the average of a sample of N people where N may be say 30. Only I don’t care whatsoever that such and such a drug or supplement didn’t on average help a group of people with N=30. I care about whether it can help me, with a sample size of 1, N=1; that’s all that matters. While these studies are useful in giving people a direction of what could help them at the end of the day one never really knows until they try something themselves and for that reason clinical studies matter much less than we think.

The fourth problem is a serious problem with doctors in the U.S. and most of it has to do with unaligned interests and education. What most doctors learn has very little to do with how actually systems work together and pharmacology. They basically know that X disease has Y symptoms and is treated with drug Z. They identify and treat diseases but without much thought to underlying physiological systems. They take a band aid approach as opposed to thinking the problem through and getting to the underlying cause. Doctors may spend 15 minutes with a patient a month. These are serious problems that people are having. Tell me, for those of you that work with clients or in projects, how much time on average do you spend on a project? Hopefully, it’s more than 15 minutes otherwise I’m assuming it wouldn’t be a very good project or a client might not be to happy. Most of this has to do with education and the incentives health insurance companies give to doctors. Pharmaceutical companies push doctors to prescribe drugs while most doctors have little if any knowledge of potential helpful supplements. We have a sick care system and not a healthcare system. 

Finally, we have a problem with doctors fear of lawsuits and the way we compensate them. Patients should be able to make there own healthcare decisions and doctors should be mere advisors in this process. Instead, doctors have merely become gatekeepers to medicine that patients can’t get without said doctor. In this gatekeeper system doctors are unwilling to prescribe certain helpful medications or provide certain advice for fear of being sued or having their license taken away. 

For all of these reasons, people turn to supplements and cannot trust the healthcare system or doctors. These are real people with real suffering and will do anything or try anything to get better. They are desperate and the established system continues to ignore their suffering and desperation. I recommend those with mental health issues seek out help in all forms. Find a naturopath or integrative medicine doctor that you can use as a legitimate advisor and then use regular doctors for what they are which are gatekeepers to medication and lab tests. With all the information online one has access to all the information doctors and mental health professionals have. Not much needs to be known about physiology. Doctors simply diagnose based on symptoms and prescribe all ready approved drugs for that condition. I believe people are smart enough to do this same thing in their own without the unnecessary education doctors go through. In this process, supplements can be very helpful to people and medications, alternative treatments and supplements should all be utilized to solve the one most important thing, relief of your suffering."

Supplements,f9u1qo7,t3_e6ywlq,1575642824.0,"I have had the same issue though not really sure it’s been tied to supplements. I’ve had GERD for a while and take pantoprazole and Pepcid daily. Within the last few years the abdominal pain started and after an endoscopy my Gastro thought it was IBS for a little bit. More recently I had a gastric emptying study done and got diagnosed with gastroparesis, so basically my stomach empties too slowly causing gas, bloating and pain, also had a HIDA scan and was also found to have biliary dyskinesia which is a problem where the gallbladder empties itself slowly, which can also cause pain. We don’t know which condition is truly the cause. Both conditions are thought to be neurological in that both the stomach and gallbladder muscles do not contract properly. So in your case, if your problem is similar, it could be from an impact your supplements are having on these muscle contractions. It could also potentially be something to do with magnesium. I know magnesium stearate is used as filler in a lot of products and for my personally I found magnesium glycinate made my stomach feel much worse though I think that was more due to the glycine as magnesium threonate makes me feel fine. I also have found popcorn and MSG to make things worse as well. Hope this helps! Good luck!"

Nootropics,f8regzb,t1_f8rbz8o,1574738385.0,Can you tell me more about your prior symptoms and how these assistants have helped them. I was diagnosed with GERD awhile back and take 40mg of pantoprazole in the morning and 20mg of Pepcid morning and night. They thought I had IBS but recently it’s been determined I have gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) and also we just find out my gallbladder also has a problem and also empties slowly. My symptoms are awful. I can’t tie them to any specific foods and often feel just as bad on an empty stomach. I threw up this morning and periodically do for no reason. The pain I can’t even necessarily tie to my stomach and is more of a discomfort like feeling but it encompasses my entire body and when it’s bad I feel myself disassociating to varying degrees from just feeling less present to sometimes going into hibernation for minutes to hours and completely losing sense of time. Wondering if your suggestions might help and what impact those things are having on my supplementation and absorption of meds and nutrients.

I usually try to take my Pepcid and pantaprazole about an hour before the vyvanse to hopefully bring that acid down but that’s just me assuming it’s similar to adderall I’m being better absorbed at low acid. Not sure how vyvanse being a prodrug is affected in that regard and my NP keeps telling me that I should be taking the vyvanse first instead and didn’t seem to agree with the fact that it’s better at low acid. Lately my vyvanse struggles to work and is really wushu washy day by day. Any advice on this?

Chances are I will always want as much hair as possible and therefore will continue to pursue this goal thought the entirety of my life. I've included a graph about my opinion of what could happen over time with different scenarios of finasteride use. I'm not sure if this is in anyway accurate or what the actual long-term effects are which is mostly what I'm wondering. 

Notice in my model, early finasteride use leads to more hair early on in your 20's-40s but then results in actually having less hair in your later years 60's-80's. I know many will not be concerned with the state of their hair in those times, but everyone has different goals around preventing hair loss. I'm mostly curious as to if my proposed model is something I may need to weigh in my decision to take finasteride. 

I may still start fin right away but if there is s there a trade-off between short-term gains at the risk of long-term losses I would like to be aware of it so that I can incorporate this into my decision making process. That being said. if use of finsateride for the entirety of one's life consistently results in more hair at every stage of that life, then the decision becomes a no-brainier. 

Does anyone have any insight as to whether my concern on starting finasteride early might be legitimate?"
