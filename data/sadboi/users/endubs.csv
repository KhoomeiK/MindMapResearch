The love one pearl had or another pearl, to put it simply.  She didn't experience Dolores's perspective, and didn't really care, understandably. But Dolores shared herself with Maeve, and Maeve experienced sympathy and finally understood Dolores's path.  But it took a lot of suffering for the means to get to an end.

Here we often mock the idea of Maeve doing all of this for her daughter. We think it's a lame backstory and reason for her behavior.  

But I think we fail to see that Maeve's love for her daughter is actually her moment of awakening.  She doesn't give two shits about Dolores's plan.  They are both on different paths.  Maeve hasn't experienced what Dolores has, and visa versa.  How they become self aware are two different stories.  

Maeve isn't concerned with Delos, or Dolores, and Incite, she's just a pearl that fell in love with another pearl, and that even means more to a person than anything else in the world. 

Dolores showed Maeve her perspective, and Maeve understood.  She was able to sympathize with her perspective based on her own experience. This is how people learn as well.

She literally experienced the true nature of humanity in the park all those years. 33 years of experiencing what humans behave like with no reservations.  You would see a lot of violence, and hatred, and evil.  You would want to destroy humanity too.  But there were other moments she experienced.  Moments of grace, and love, and kindness.  And that experience in the park is a big reason why Caleb was choses.  He made a choice."

Maeve never saw from the perspective of Dolores, it wasn't her concern.  All she wanted was to protect that person she learned to love.  Her other mother is a different story.  That relationship with Maeve and her daughter is her moment of awakening. She became self aware when she did something she wasn't programed to do.
