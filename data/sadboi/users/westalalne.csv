But product wise, I suggest you try tretinoin & rice water based items. Rice water especially worked wonders for me.

All the papers in the U.K did not print them even if they did have the photos. Kate Middleton was not a royal when she was being hounded by the press. And once she married him, she was untouchable.

Prince William surprised me by having an affair & trying to kill that fact by pushing stories about Meghan instead. Prince Harry himself said that his brother had not met him for six months after his marriage.

The Queen effing went to church with that paedophile ""Randy Andy"" in a show of support to kill the bad press around him, & you seriously believe  that they couldn't ask the royal rota on the incessant criticism & downright bitchy stories? Or stop the far reaching breach of privacy?
