90dayfianceuncensored,fmxm5qx,t1_fmxfxzi,1586467582.0,I wonder if they are still in that one bedroom apartment. She’s really gonna be complaining now when she has two kids sleeping in her bed. 😅
nursing,fddy9n3,t3_ekkagj,1578326898.0,"Yes. When I am exhausted and get home after a long shift, I hear a faint IV pump alarm in the distance. I’m climbing into my bed shrugging “it aint coming from one of my rooms.”"
nursing,fa9pnha,t1_fa9pag2,1575885179.0,"Thank you!!! You dont know how much it helps to just hear from someone who felt the same way i do now and lived to tell haha. 

And yes, I never really expect people to do things for me after they give me report. Hell, you just did your time and I have 12 hours to do mine. Go the fuck home, its a 24 hr facility. 

I’m going to try and remember some good moments I have and write them down now so I will have them. I realized the other night I cried when I got home because I felt like a shitty nurse and completely disregarded all the good things that I did that night. Its really hard for me to be positive sometimes.

Thank you thank you thank you again!!! ♥️"

nursing,f7kt1ni,t3_dwo4yv,1573825015.0,Never ever feel bad about doing what you think is right for a patient. You did what you thought was best and one day you will report something that will save someone’s life. I know its hard to let things like that roll of your back (I struggle with it too) but you are being a good nurse.
nursing,f7ksmux,t1_f7icpnb,1573824653.0,"Sort of similar situation, less severe. We had a doctor that verbally told the nurse “Go ahead and pull room 1’s foley.” The nurse goes and does it, but it was the wrong patient. The doctor then denied he told her to do so and the nurse got in trouble for it. I’m super sketched over verbal orders now, ugh."

I was extremely disappointed to hear nurses withholding pain medication and stuff from them. As a nurse, it’s not my job to punish the person.

90DayFiance,f18skb6,t3_d881cu,1569262747.0,I don’t understand their relationship. They haven’t even gotten to know each other irl. She just immediately shoved him over to meet her brother. They haven’t gotten anytime to be a couple. But I guess I’m giving this more credit than it needs.. it’s just an arrangement lol.
