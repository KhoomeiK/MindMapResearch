Last time they tried to convince me to order some diet lemonade twist or something like that. Like our customers already don’t even buy the drinks it’s just a waste of money.

carolinekonstnar,fnsu8yg,t1_fnseu05,1587228898.0,"If you think this lowly of her why would you take the time to write paragraphs on a subreddit dedicated to her that you’d have to find by searching for it? You obviously know a lot about her content. Personally if I don’t like someone’s content I just don’t watch it. Why are you calling someone out for being born into a fortunate family? Who cares? If you were born in a mansion with a Ferrari because you’re family worked hard for it would you leave it all behind in fear people will call you a thot? And even if she theoretically is a full-blown thot who gives a fuck. She’s not hurting anybody. She’s making content like anyone else. Focus your energy on murders or pedophiles why don’t you? Full offense but focusing all that energy into a 16 year old says a lot about you.

depression,evjm8n8,t3_cjzusc,1564565282.0,"I’ve attempted suicide twice and both times were nearly successful. I went to 3 different psychiatric hospitals. One was a residential I was in for six fucking months. I was in between four walls – for six months. My depressed and absolutely hopeless soul was in a position in which I wanted to die so urgently and commit suicide, but I could not make that choice for myself. I remember feeling “off” at all times. I “code greened”, otherwise known as “running away” from the residential any chance I had when I first got there. They eventually locked me up into the “lockdown” unit which is where my 6 months in between four walls began. 

The reason I ended up in that position? The reason I was so depressed and wholeheartedly hopeless and had nothing left to give? 

I started forming this mindset at age 12 that held an overwhelming amount of pessimistic ideas. I started analyzing everything around me, but only what was wrong with it all. It was never the positive. I never once thought to myself “well maybe something good can come from this.” I just sat there. All the time. Negatively analyzing things to the point nothing brought me joy. I grew this sort of apathetic and almost indistinguishable attitude throughout this mindset and made a lot of mistakes. I hurt a lot of people emotionally. 

But the worst thing I did? Out of everything I ever did through those periods of apathetic and depressed times? 

Attempting suicide without any regard to anyone in my life or around me. The most vivid memory I have currently is my mom sloppily driving to the emergency room screaming at the top of her lungs pleading to god her daughter won’t die and this won’t be the last time she sees me breathing. That has stuck with me since it happened and will forever be engraved into my subconscious mind for as long as I live.  

Over the 8 months total being in 3 psych wards I realized something. My mom loved me. My little brother who watched his big sis overdose multiple times and watched her scream at god to kill her loved me. My father who quit his drinking problem as soon as I was born into the world loves me. And they will continue to love me. Even if I kill myself they will continue to love me. And the empathy I gained over the thought of my loved ones losing something they love, my friends losing someone they loved? The thought of everyone that loves me losing something they can never get back. One of the main reasons I wanted to die which I did not mention above was the loss of someone very important to me in my life. So my coping method? Killing myself. Which will only cause the people who care about me fall into the same mindset as me. Some get over it and move on. Which is a great thing. But some? They don’t. My mom looked me in the face and told me she would never get over my death if I were to commit suicide. 

Look man, you say you have no one. Nothing to live for. That’s not fucking true. Right now? Yeah sure maybe it might be true. But if you want to look at this logically there wouldn’t be people commenting long and meaningful things on a post YOU made. Need to mention you’re asking for help which means you ARE capable of fighting for yourself and making life for yourself....worth living. Not everything has a negative outcome. Not everything is bad. There is a balance if you have patience and understanding of the world around you. 

Life does provide meaningful and good things sometimes. 

Please, please don’t make this choice. You are a person and you have worth just like everything else. Even if we’re here for no reason or by simple chance that doesn’t mean you can’t make a difference. If I killed myself I wouldn’t be here right now typing this out. And sure it might not even help or you might not read it to begin with but if my comment or someone else’s can help someone through something? It’s worth it in my eyes. A constant chain of helping eachother out and giving a new meaning to life. 

What happens down the road when someone you were meant to cross paths with and help doesn’t
get the help they could of had because you decided to end it all. 

I wish the best of luck to you. Whatever may happen. However life goes for you, I just wish the best of luck. I hope you’re still breathing and have a better outlook.

PapaJohns,euuiu9a,t3_che8eq,1564045180.0,You need to know what’s going on with your store. A lot of GM’s and DO’s will ask you what your store numbers look like and how it’s running. This isn’t a guarantee but it’s likely they will ask a question like that. They might ask why you want to be a manager. Just be honest. Overall they’re going to look at your performance above all else. Make sure you know how to do dough correctly and listen carefully when you’re getting trained. My best advice is to just be yourself and try your best! Good luck to you and I promise the job is easy once you get the hang of it.
