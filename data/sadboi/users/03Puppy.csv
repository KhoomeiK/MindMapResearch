depression,fq9d01r,t3_ghkh23,1589194110.0,"I feel like a bad person for trying to make them stay close to me as long as i can't bring them happiness, so no."
raisedbynarcissists,fpqocui,t3_gf04ix,1588827693.0,"I obeyed her until i felt nothing for her anymore. And she was just a another chore. Just another item on my daily ""to do"" list. Like when you give a baby a pacifier to stop crying lol.Things to do in a day: talk to mom in the morning for 10 mins. Lie about everything she asks. 10 mins in the afternoon. 10 mins in the evening. 
And there you go. She will think you love her more than anything else."

Soulnexus,flyuw0r,t3_fro7us,1585609587.0,"I've had this shit all my life and i'm 21 now. I haven't realized it until one day after i broke up with my first and only bf, when i was very sad and angry at everyone and it was like my mind,all of a sudden, pushed everyone's voices away and only i remained inside me. And for the first time in my life, i swear, at 20 years old, i realized i have a body. I remember looking at my hands and thinking ""oh my god i have hands! I have a body! I'm inside me! It feels so good!""
But in 3 days it passed. There's really something very wrong with me. I hope from the bottom of my heart it's not something normal and most people know they are real and feel inside their bodies.
I feel unreal and dead. Out of place. Outside of everything. I can't even explain. And it's been so long... It's like living like a ghost. 
Please guys tell me you don't feel like this. It would make me so happy to know you can feel good too.Even if i won't ever feel inside myself again, as long as i know you don't have this problem, it would give me hope."

depression,exzdvz8,t1_exxze74,1566664555.0,"Don't give up. Keep fighting for what you want. Try finding a job. I got fired from/left several jobs until i found a perfect one(nice ppl, nice salary,easy tasks). It will still feel like shit at first,because you have to wake up in the morning and be responsible, but at the end of the day you will feel good about yourself and find motivation to do other things. Try it guys :)  Love you."

depression,ewyobib,t3_cqrcz8,1565884327.0,It's tiring.And the loneliness it brings is beyond words.
Soulnexus,ewvz1gj,t3_cqe1bm,1565816958.0,"Okay, this is what i feel it means: you should stop dwelling on the past because it's not going to bring you anything good. Find strenght and move forward. This is what came to my mind. I might be wrong."
Soulnexus,evwf6q8,t3_cldorq,1564862562.0,Why are you guys so pessimistic? How about returning to the Source? Our consciousness will remain and we will start again ^-^

Soulnexus,et5vcin,t3_ca4tbg,1562491950.0,"It's not that. It's just you're not in touch with your true self. That story you put there has nothing to do with reality. 
I know what you're experiencing, and yeah it can seem like you're programmed or whatever but it's not true."
Soulnexus,esh5ow5,t3_c7izyl,1561983322.0,I'm scared
depression,esf25md,t3_c7batd,1561915291.0,"I was the same on my 20th birthday. I feared the day i would turn 20 because i thought i will be old and everything nice in my life will get replaced by adult responsabilities. 
And the day i finally turned 20 was hell (That was in april this year). The fact that i broke up with my bf  (of 5 years) one day before, made it even worse. 
I get you. You are not alone. I love you so much and i can promise you better days will come. You are strong and amazing :)"

And if i, a stranger, can care so much about you, just think about your boyfriend. I'm not saying this to make you feel like you owe the world your life and that you should keep living for others. I'm only saying it to let you know you are loved. Deeply. Stay strong. Keep fighting. Better days will come. Keep your head high and wipe away the tears. I believe in you ."

depression,erjef2l,t3_c2ar5w,1560925715.0,"So what if you are short? You can find a short girl. What if you are fat? You can either lose weight or just relax because the people who judge you don't deserve your friendship. Just take care of yourself and be healthy. The right people, the ones who can appreciate you, will come into your life. Many hugs to you, my friend :)"

depression,ercj023,t3_c1d2s9,1560713459.0,Same here. Feels like the ground wants to swallow us. I feel like a butterfly with no wings. Have you ever seen one? Have you seen the way they struggle to move after you pull their wings? That's us...
