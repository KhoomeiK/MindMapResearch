triplej,f9w0x8t,t1_f9vqvkp,1575685037.0,and it‚Äôs not like sticky fingers ever did anything like this at all the footage of when dylan was accused shows his innocence yet she sticks us for these cowards who almost bash them to death. it‚Äôs cause she has nothing to gain from them so she doesn‚Äôt go after them
triplej,f9w0sr7,t1_f9vqvkp,1575684940.0,thelma plum chooses who she can profit some more listening through and who she can‚Äôt. she used sticky as a way to get more popularity but when the truth actually came out it backfired

triplej,f7b9i52,t3_cgptlt,1573561882.0,as in not by sti fi but the media because after everything dizza has been WRONGLY accused of in the past two years he has become an easy target
triplej,f7b9g8m,t3_cgptlt,1573561824.0,"honestly i feel like this was just a publicity stunt. paddy posted a photo that night saying like all the love for dylan and dylan commented love you bro or something. also, *allegedly* if it was definitely them they would not have said allegedly because obviously it is less definite and convincing"
stickyfingers,f77pd93,t3_byhiei,1573469280.0,have they ever played this live? cause dizza‚Äôs voice singing this live would be amazing

stickyfingers,f6y0prt,t3_dtpjil,1573264171.0,such a tear jerker especially live üòç
stickyfingers,f6y0h5x,t3_dtjux7,1573263969.0,i saw them in melbourne and he was great and they all looked really happy compared to previous concerts i‚Äôve seen of theirs. not to make dylan sound like a junkie but possibly because they are all supposedly sober maybe he is having withdrawals and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs acting pretty weird in interviews and stuff idk just a thought
stickyfingers,f6w9q60,t3_dtfjbd,1573220957.0,paddy and dizza ü•∞
stickyfingers,f6w8qp5,t3_dtewra,1573220137.0,omg thank you so much!!! was it a good show?

stickyfingers,f6vyp79,t1_f2nvuf5,1573208036.0,there is like an 8 minute video that dispossessed posted on their youtube and basically they were talking about racism against aboriginals in australia and dylan was silent but dylan's girlfriend started having a go and dylan tried to calm it down and somehow he got blamed for it
stickyfingers,f6ufe66,t1_f6uf4o6,1573162145.0,yeah nah fr for his sake i hope he is sober or on a good path but yeah i just love them and hope they‚Äôre all good and safe

stickyfingers,f6ro6vu,t3_dqh3gt,1573112318.0,they were insanely good last friday in melbourne and dylan seemed fine
stickyfingers,f6ro0ia,t3_dsqq3k,1573112068.0,completely agree. he was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and that mixed with his depression and other struggles with mental illness and then possibly mixed with drugs is not good. but i really respect him and the rest of the boys for not trying to make people feel bad for them considering everything they have been through and still making amazing music
mentalhealth,exk1pju,t3_ct5nf2,1566368723.0,that‚Äôs so so amazing xxx whatever you‚Äôre struggling with i hope this helps
