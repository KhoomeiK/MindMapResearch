AskReddit,fqkotoz,t3_gjfe1g,1589432282.0,"hm. about 5’7.5”, perfectly sized for hugs that feel safe.  soft hands. a nose freckle that i only recently learned is an acne scar, after 5 years of him being in my life. the most intelligent person i have ever met. funny without trying. can make me laugh and piss me off all in the same breath. has been there for me through more than just about any other person. a really bad texter. ticklish. snores so loudly. always jerks as he’s falling asleep. he usually softly kisses my shoulder when he wakes up in the middle of the night - it always wakes me up, and i love it. can somehow always make me feel loved even when it’s hard to love myself. my favorite person to grow with that ive met so far. has an immaculate fashion sense, an extremely pokeable butt, and stupid long eyelashes. he is an excellent cook, has made me try new things, and is my favorite travel partner. can somehow always bring the sunshine when i rain on my own parade.

AskReddit,fjdea9g,t3_fcwisu,1583251483.0,"i had to move apartments halfway through my lease for my dog. 

i had been having problems at my apartment complex for *MONTHS*. i had maintenance requests in for my living room outlets, my heater didn’t work, my power tripped all the time because i had to use space heaters because my heater didn’t work.. it was a mess. i finally had enough and called the corporate office. i left a very thorough, professional voicemail, but still let them know i was pissed. 

my maintenance guy came in the next day. 

the day after that, i had a notice on my door saying that i had 10 days to rehome my dog or i would face eviction. because she “barked aggressively” at him when he entered my apartment. while she was in her crate... in my bedroom. i wasn’t home & a stranger was in our house - of course she is going to bark. 

i asked the lady in the office, and she said that “owning aggressive dogs can be cause for eviction.” i said that was bullshit. 

1.) my lease states i receive 24 hours notice before anyone enters my apartment. i didn’t receive that. 
2.) i had requests in for 2.5 months before anyone came in to fix the things that were wrong. 

i was able to use those two facts to show how the APARTMENT COMPLEX violated the terms of my lease agreement, broke my lease, and moved out a month later. 

my grandparents watched her for a while during my hunt for a new apartment. i moved in january & now i get snuggles with my lana every night :’)
