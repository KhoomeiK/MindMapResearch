Give him that space and time, without hounding him. I know it's hard because our brains are going a million miles an hour Wondering what we did wrong, what we said wrong, what could have done different or better.

If he's stuck around this long, this quiet phase is a good sign.

So my best guess, from a girl's point of view, she wanted to get you something. Just for fun even. She didn't want to spend a lot, and I doubt she expected anything in return.

dating,epy3zhu,t3_bwi4gi,1559618668.0,"It's one of the ways women show love. She is doing it because she is feeling loved and fulfilled.
I can be an issue though if she starts to feel like it's one sided. Like she might start overdoing it because she starts feeling like she's getting less from you.
A woman won't stop giving. Instead she will give more because she feels like something is wrong and that's her instinctive way of trying to fix it.
If that happens and there is poor communication, she will start resenting you.

Maybe just let her know as much as you really appreciate everything she does that you don't expect it and she obviously doesn't have to.
Try to pick up on clues she gives on ways you can show her love.

If you haven't read the 5 love languages, I recommend it.
You could give 100% of yourself but the other person doesn't perceive it as love because they have a certain love language."

Women equate sex with love and if she orgasms with you, that's like setting it in stone.

I appreciate you being sensitive to her feelings, that's really awesome. Not many guys care. But even speaking for myself, (and I'm like you, I hate ghosting them or just being rude, especially when they are a kind, sweet person, they're just not your type) we can only be so nice and try so hard.

Dating just sucks. Flat out. I've had to grow quite a thick skin for online dating. I had to realize everyone has a type, including me.
And it just is what it is. We can't be responsible for everyone's feelings. We can be nice, like you were but can't lose sleep over it.

I think some guys think I'm kidding when I tell them I'm not interested because by, I guess, society's standards they are a 10 but I'm just not interested or attracted.
I'm a true sapiosexual. I also happen to think Jack Black is hot.

Upfront, I don't disclose how much I make (>$75k) and because I live below my means I don't look like I just have extra disposable income.
I get to know the guy, see how he handles money, does he always look for handouts, is he looking for someone to always foot the bill. If he is, he's not the guy for me and I descreetly move on.

I don't openly say that income is a factor, because at the end of the day it's not, but how they manage the money they do have and can they support themselves, not looking to someone to support them is important."
