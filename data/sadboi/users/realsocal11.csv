We’d hug and hold hands. I was just not confident enough, I realize too later hopefully I get to change that. I had to figure out why things happened and I came to the conclusion that I was just not being confident enough and taking the opportunities, which probably made her leave after frustrating herself. To a small defense, she wasn’t directly up front, to my demise, I wasn’t savvy enough. Either way I’ll learn from this, I had not dated anyone in a year and had just gotten out of a 4 year relationship so I really didn’t have any idea about how to initiate anything past a hug. I hooked up with girls after my break up but they would make it easy for me. High value women aren’t as easy. Totally a learning experience."

Once in a while I’ll get included but I think people see me as not fun enough. I’m usually the person people go to for serious advice rather than for fun.

dating_advice,f8ae4gd,t3_dzpb20,1574394757.0,"Bro I fell in love in high school. She was my high school sweetheart, had my first time having sex with her, dated into college, spent all my days with her, grew up with her and thought my life was already set and though that we’d get old together but she left me 4 years later out of nowhere. Sometimes I wish I wouldn’t have done that. Sometimes I think I was too young, sometimes I think it hurt my development as a person. I’ve had to learn a lot of lessons because of that. I never learned to be independent without her. I never felt alone with my thoughts, something a lot of my peers learned to manage a lot earlier than me, I went through and existential crisis and damn near almost lost my mind after we broke up. It just goes to show that the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. Don’t stress about these things too much. Life will come at ya when you least expect it and you’ll get your share of balance. Right now you’re living one thing and when you least expect it, you’ll end up living something else."
