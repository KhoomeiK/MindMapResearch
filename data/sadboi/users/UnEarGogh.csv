bipolar,fo320ag,t3_g5cr5g,1587479025.0,im with ya. i dont have much going on in my social life and this pandemic has made me realize that even more. :/
BipolarReddit,fmmfrfy,t3_fw2st2,1586204458.0,I'm with ya. Jumping out of my skin right now.
bipolar,fmc52iw,t3_ftv9mh,1585939053.0,"I'm not a nurse but I have been taking different doses of Seroquel for a few years and I have bipolar 1. 400mg at night for a couple years... with 200mg during the day as needed. Down to 200mg at night now. It certainly works for me but I feel like I'm mentally slower on it... which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. 

I'm also uncertain about medication availability at this time, but I trust that seroquel alone will keep me from losing my mind during this crisis, even without the other meds I'm prescribed. 

That being said, if 5mg sends you to ""crazy town"", a higher dosage might have a different effect. If the higher dose still messes you up then maybe it's just not for you. 

As far as diazepam goes, my doctors wont prescribe a benzo because of my history of substance abuse and it being something people can abuse. Also, it's not an official BP mood stabilizer.

That's just my experience. I hope you can find something that works for you, especially during this trying time."
bipolar,flofvhu,t3_fpwb21,1585337508.0,Same.
bipolar,flm7s53,t1_flm6ax0,1585276607.0,"I hear ya. I remember some of those times myself and when I look back on them sometimes I scratch my head because I wasn't ""wrong"" by any means."

bipolar,flm1hwt,t1_flm1af5,1585272407.0,Nah i've been on it for a while and it seems to mute my feelings. I'm pretty much just stuck in depression 24/7. I feel better with the reduction. I'm just hoping I don't end up manic or mixed again.
bipolar,flm11xc,t1_flm0vxc,1585272118.0,Yea? Right now I'm just trying to get of the seroquel and see how it goes.
bipolar,flm0no5,t1_flm0ipv,1585271856.0,Definitely isn't but I feel way better in general. Seems to have lifted some of the depression.
bipolar,flm0e0k,t3_fplyvd,1585271681.0,Went from 400mg seroquel to 200mg and added latuda. Now i wake up every two hours from crazy vivid dreams.
bipolar,flly8bu,t3_fpmx2i,1585270297.0,Agreed. I went through WAAAAY too many years undiagnosed. Can't wait to see your graphic.
bipolar,flh293a,t1_flh1yxa,1585154743.0,Yes! That's awesome! So happy to hear this.
BipolarReddit,fldlnek,t3_fo7jfd,1585067012.0,"Agreed. The parts of myself that I love the most have been taken away. I'd say hypomanic me is the favorite version. But I hate manic me. I cringe when I think back to those times. 

I've seen a lot of doctors since diagnosis and multiple hospitalizations. But one thing a doctor said to me that'll I'll never forget was that I ""need to aim for being higher than most"" when it comes to mood and meds, because that's what we're used to when feeling good. 

I'm also going through med changes.. and I feel ya on that feeling that something might be coming."
bipolar,fkqwizl,t3_fjxzak,1584457075.0,I'm unfortunately guilty of the later.
BipolarReddit,fkhkviu,t3_fif9ny,1584201010.0,Fun right? I'm reducing seroquel and sleep hasn't been happening for days. Gotta love these drugs.

bipolar,fkgfnrz,t3_fic1s2,1584158298.0,"Yes... on a good day. And then later on I'll find myself thinking of all the ways I could do it. It's REALLY hard to accept life as it's turned out, especially when the major components of life have been drastically altered by BP. It's tough to want to try again. Like try to get somewhere I've been before. It's embarrassing too. I'd love to hit the off switch. 

The struggle is real. You're not alone."
BipolarReddit,fkgdrmf,t1_fkgdc37,1584156739.0,"Thanks! And yes the missed income makes me feel like complete dogshit. But I'm REALLY easy on myself. TOO easy. I just let my shit slide. No one's gonna fire me. 

As far as snapping out of it goes, I dunno. I guess once I get into the swing of things it gets easier. My job also involves some sales and man if I'm medicated/depressed (which is most of the time the last couple years), my sales aren't very good at all. So I don't know. I'm still figuring out meds and whatnot so I'm hoping I can sort of get some momentum and get to place where I view money like most. Like GO FOR IT. Right now it doesn't phase me one bit so I just skate by."
BipolarReddit,fkgd16i,t3_fiby0c,1584156147.0,"Oh yes. Very much so. Ten years ago I was desperately trying to get a barely above minimum wage job because it was my ""dream"". Fast forward ten years, diagnosis and several manic episodes, I own my own company. Also capable of earning lots of dough, but just don't give a shiiiiiit. Don't wanna do it. If you were to tell me where I'd be in ten years back then, I'd be THRILLED. Now I got it, and couldn't care less."

bipolar,fkc9zsa,t1_fkc9oll,1584048747.0,whomp whomp. I just want something to sleep that's not a dose of seroquel that's enough to put an elephant down.
bipolar,fkc9qqp,t3_fhil4d,1584048602.0,"Welcome! I just started posting here too. Also relate to the depression. Between mixed episodes and straight out depression, it's been longer than I'd like to admit. Sure can suck the social right out of me. 

Hope this is just the start of you feeling more connected."
bipolar,fkc4di4,t1_fkc40lt,1584045555.0,"Good to know. I definitely would not have suspected that. 

Thanks!"
bipolar,fkbcpw2,t3_fhgxqh,1584030559.0,"If I were to take a guess I'd say it sounds like type 2. I also had a wishy washy diagnosis in the beginning and went on a very lengthy, deep search to find answers. it was super confusing and frustrating.

At some point years later, I stumbled upon a doctors brain scan that showed the brain activity of bipolar during mania where the frontal lobe just shuts off. Goes dark. Nothing. That explains why we don't make logical decisions. We may be creative and emotional and full of energy, things we do just don't make logical sense.

I don't remember what hypomania looked like, but I'd expect there still to be activity there. Maybe not as much as a healthy brain, but you're not making decisions that ruin your life yet. 

In my experience, looking back at the times I was manic, it's pretty clear. My decisions made no sense at all. I ruined my life. I needed desperate help. Hypomanic times, though interesting, never resulted in things I deeply regret.

If you want to go straight to the source for info, try checking out the latest DSM at the library. There's no interpretation from websites there.

Hope that helps a little bit. And I hope you get the answers you're looking for."

bipolar,fk8l0zu,t3_fh383i,1583958059.0,I've had issues in the past with different medications. I can pretty much gauge where I am in a mood cycle by how things are working for me down there.
bipolar,fk86igv,t3_fh0n3t,1583950279.0,That's been on repeat.
bipolar,fk86c0v,t3_fh0rzz,1583950183.0,"I relate to this on such a deep level. I'm so scared of relationships because of what I've destroyed in the past. I'm a good employee, but never left a job on good terms. I'm good in relationships, but when I'm manic I explode and run for the hills, destroying everything in my path. I'm trying to be open minded about relationships again but the feelings of low self-worth are hard to fight. Solitude only makes things worse for me. It's a constant battle. 

Just know you aren't alone."
bipolar,fk7uihd,t1_fk7t0w8,1583943872.0,"I guess all you can do is try. Regardless of your test results, you don't like how this medication is effecting your body/life. 

In my experience though, doctors always seem to want to add another one on before taking one away. They'll say ""Seroquel can be a mood stabilizer for bipolar so we should probably add X before reducing the seroquel"". To me that's the most frustrating. So we titrate up on X for months before reducing Y for months?!

It's super frustrating and can be down right disheartening. I've been messing around with this for years and I'm still not certain what's right or not."
bipolar,fk7qy5t,t3_fgz1g9,1583941935.0,"I hear you on this. I'm also on seroquel. 300mg now, was 400 for a long time. Last time I went to the psych I told him I wanted to reduce it again, but he was scared to because it's ""kept me stable for all this time"". But the side effects suck. My mind is mush now. I have an appointment in about a hour and I plan to tell him we NEED to reduce it again. Roll the dice if you will.

Also went through neuro psych testing and was kind of disappointed with the process and results. ""Looks like you could be bipolar"" was my result.

I guess what I'm saying is I can relate. Waiting sucks. The thought of waiting sucks even more. And I'm guilty of not expressing my concerns with my doctors with enough emphasis. It's really important that we advocate for ourselves properly. These doctors don't know what it's like to take these pills. And ultimately it's our lives that are effected. So if it's not working right, it's time to make a change. If one doctor doesn't agree with you, that's not to say another won't. 

Good luck with your appointments. Hope things change for the better sooner rather than later."

bipolar,fju6pkk,t3_fexxwa,1583614119.0,"I was on it for a year and FLATTEN is an understatement. When docs ask me about it I tell them it worked like a sledge hammer for opening a walnut. Effective but overkill. I was a zombie on it. There are plenty of other mood stabilizers out there to try. Maybe ask for a newer med when you see your doc. Also, something to consider: When we are used to mood fluctuations unmedicated and then then all of a sudden we are on a mood stabilizer, it can be a HUGE transition. One doc told me I should shoot for feeling a bit on the higher side, since that's what we're accustomed too. Made sense to me."
