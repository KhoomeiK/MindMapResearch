depression,f44tqdr,t1_f43oc05,1571358680.0,"I quit all social media. Changed my number. Ghosted everyone I knew. I couldn't take pretending to be someone I wasn't anymore. Fun, passionate, interesting. That was almost a year and a half ago when I finally quit my job to go into treatment. I was suicidal all the time, barely hanging on. 

Recently started a new Twitter account. I used to be very active on Twitter, had a lot of followers. Had an opinion lots of people wanted to hear. But as I got better I wanted an outlet, just to express myself, find out what I really care about again. It's helping. I follow reporters mostly. Search hashtags and follow people whose tweets I like. 

I just had to let that person die, let the shame die with her. That is the only way I could start over. Realized expressing myself is more important than feeling validated and important. Finding out who I want to be is better for me now than trying to reclaim who I used to be."

BPD,f448j6w,t3_dj7t4o,1571349176.0,"After many years of no contact, my father sent my sister a letter. I had no contact for an additional 4. We were shocked, but curious about the content. Turns out it was eerily similar to the apology letter I sent him when I was 16. In short, you did things that hurt me, I did things that hurt you, I forgive you, sorry for anything I did that hurt you.

If he was diagnosed with BPD, he never said. But he was forever the victim and martyr, blamed it on being bipolar on the few occasions did ""take responsibility.""  My letter was a feeble attempt to get him to acknowledge what he did wrong. But as the parent, a non-apology if you ask me. Never apologized for the splitting, or gaslighting, or triangulating, or even for words that were the last straw for my sister. 

""Hey ****. F**k you, and the girl you rode in on. "" a succinct reply to her fiance's attempt to reconcile from arguments over changing the wedding date last minute, because afterall he was paying for it. He wanted to invite people we never met so his side would be larger than my mother's.  This after he tried to ban me from being in the wedding, for having no contact with him. I was the maid of honor. His ""family"" was also uninvited, as he had recruited several aunts and uncles to trash us both in a long chain of emails we were on. We haven't spoken to anyone in his ""family"" since. 

My last straw, was when he told my sister that my mom wanted to abort her, but he stopped her. Conviniently leaving out they both changed their minds, and he made the appointment. Went to pick her up when he found the house empty. Filed for divorce three months before she was born. My sister learned the word bastard, figured out she was one, when she was about 6. Still my sister blamed me for the incident. I forced us all to talk, made him sit and listen to our objections to being manipulated with money after I saw them yelling. Sister- ""You never take responsibility for anything! "" Dad- ""You're a bitch!"" - thows Tupperware at her head. 

My apology letter to him? I was 16, it was after 3 years of no contact, prompted that time when he threatened to stop child support for my sister, 11, who was so terrified of him she locked herself in the bathroom when he came to pick me up for another reunion after a few years of no contact. Didn't think it was fair if she refused to see him. I could go on, but you get the point. The letter mentioned none of this. 

Thank you for sharing, I joined this sub because I want to find compassion for him in my own recovery from depression, and codependancy. Even if I never speak to him again. I hope someday I can forgive him for the damage he's done to my self esteem and my family. 

Apologizing takes a lot of courage, but the real courage is self awareness, and empathy for the people you love. I am aware this kind of manipulation does not apply to all pwBPD, and a parent is another level than a friend or a partner. But I'm grateful for the healing and perspective this sub has given me. For your vulnerability. For your self awareness, and courage to recover from bpd.  You are brave. I hope my story can help shed light and healing. I have been battling suicide for over a year now (#metoo ptsd) sometimes daily, but it's made me face long buried trauma, silver lining I guess. 

In my isolation and alienation, you all have given me hope and compassion for myself, more than anything or anyone else has. Thank you xoxo"
depression,f3yrh7o,t1_f3y4q4w,1571258370.0,"One big difference is that people used to live in larger families and tightly woven communities. There were more collective rituals and spiritual practices. I think that gave people more purpose, meaning, and support in the face of challenges. I think our increasing isolation, and the shrinking ""family,"" combined with social media to help you compare yourself to others in your isolation, doesn't help the epidemic."
depression,f3ypzee,t1_f3xkufm,1571257730.0,"It's just so hard to remember that I ever felt happy when I have been sitting in it for months. If I am able, it feels like a movie I watched of someone else's life. I can't ""feel"" anything but hopelessness. My brain tells me- if you're lucky things will get a little better, for a little while, but they can always get much worse. That's what I hate most, that I get so alienated, I can barely remember who I was. Then I'm just grieving that person, someone I used to know."
depression,f3ynsj9,t1_f3y4s2w,1571256804.0,"Yeah my experience of trauma and loss took my partner, best friend, safety, job, and with it my identity, faith, purpose, and passion for life. I never wanted kids or marriage, I wanted to make a difference on issues I cared about, and I cared about so many. I have a history of depression, but chemicals alone never broke or fixed me. When I was successful at work, when I had faith in myself, and belonged to a community I was the happiest. But without those things, I'm just not that resilient. Estranged from my family for most of my adult life, I struggled to build a chosen one. It was not easy for friends to support me through my trauma, and too easy for me to feel betrayed and triggered. 

So a break up, job loss, car crash that left me wondering if I would be disabled for the rest of my life, took the ground out from under me. A couple years later sexual assault, and resulting PTSD, led to losing my career and ghosting everyone I knew. That is what drove me to chronic suicidality. Eventually I had to let the person I was die, to be able to accept that I had to start from scratch, if I was going to live again. 

In the process I've reconnected with my mother, who became my reason to make an effort I would not be making otherwise. I don't believe in God, but I did have a spiritual practice and believe in the connection of all things. Believed that it is a delusion to think we are separate. But I do not believe the ""Lord"" or ""universe"" has ""a plan"" for each of us. Just that people create meaning for themselves. It always came naturally to me. 

But nothing had meaning anymore. My faith that I mattered at all, disappeared. So that's my perspective, feeling that it matters that you live, or will matter if you die, gives people a reason to struggle, when all you can do is survive. I never understood, or even admired survivors. I thought living out of obligation, surviving for its own sake, was saddest thing of all, I would rather die. Now I am reluctantly surviving for someone else until I can regain hope for my future. I'm not convinced I will yet, but today I'm ok. 

TL;DR  Depression shows up differently for different people."

BPD,f38d174,t1_f36vtu5,1570735515.0,"Idk how one hour a week is enough time to get therapy and even in group therapy I take up too much time if I really need to share. The therapists that did let me vent didn't seem to help much. I've called help line to vent and they sent the police so I don't feel safe calling them. I am acutely aware I am a burden, and im too hopeless to help myself. So I don't blame anyone for keeping their distance or myself for not trusting that it will get better but knowing it can always get worse."

SuicideWatch,f1hdtze,t1_f1hdgy2,1569491315.0,"I know how you feel. When people say just try, I've tried, going on three years it feels like. When people say it gets better, I say not for me, but it can always get worse. 

But talking to you makes me want better for you, and for me too. The part of me that used to have self worth, and confidence, and hope and compassion, wants that for us both."
Bumble,f1fpji8,t1_f1flz2p,1569449858.0,"I was doing all the initiating when I was more optimistic. But after dating someone for 6 mos I felt I was compatible with, and thought I had a connection with, I basically ended it  when he let me know he did not care if I died, much less how I felt. It was the best sex I had ever had so I was in denial when he showed me he was ""emotionally unavailable, "" he literally told me that. I have been struggling but being with him gave me confidence, made me believe I could see the other side of this. I don't know that I believe that anymore. 

So now I am passively on the app, open to someone convincing me otherwise. But I'm not attracted to many men on here physically or in terms of educational background and interests. So when I put in effort it's because I am genuinely interested, but mostly it's pretty mild interest. So not going to put in much effort. On the plus side I prefer meeting in person, but mostly no connections or chemistry. 

I have had a stalker catfish me on tinder, and I'm a survivor of sexual assault by an aquaintence I knew for years, so I am generally distrustful of men, even though I have had positive experiences and dates and relationships. I am just not motivated to initiate anything right now. I have no interest in more detached casual sex, so should I just delete the app?"
Bumble,f10d1cn,t1_f0zdo8g,1569110733.0,"This is exactly how I feel about marriage, also a child of bitter divorce at 2 years old of a 7 year marriage, my only sibling was still a fetus. 

My mother never remarried or had another LTR. I don't speak to my dad anymore. But I ended a 10 year relationship with my partner a few years ago and I'm grateful I never cared to, or felt pressured to, get married. I am grateful for the unconditional love and support I got and gave in my partnership, and I know I can find it again. 

Just because it didn't last forever, doesn't mean it failed. Or make it any less valuable than the relationships of people who were married for less, or more, years for that matter. And the pain of separation and loss was no less difficult. But I didn't have the additional suffering and expenses of going through divorce."
Bumble,f10b038,t1_f0zdpiz,1569109920.0,"I just yesterday saw a profile about this topic and started a conversation about it when we matched. Maybe I'll post that, but my point was that people have relationships with every other person they interact with, casual or formal, with people you know briefly or for a long time. 

You define the boundaries and expectations of each. If you chat with the cashier for example, or make friends with classmates. So I read the animosity to the word relationship as an opposition to commitment, or in favor of nsa sex, but am I wrong? 

Representing generation Y myself, who no one mentions anymore for some reason, marriage was never a goal of mine. I don't believe in it. But I do believe in long term commitment and monogamy, which I know is out of style. So I am a fan of relationships and committed monogamy but not marriage."
SuicideWatch,f0y4m38,t1_f0xfupw,1569060556.0,"I searched BPD on YouTube and found a video with an interview of a pwBPD, she said something that stuck with me. Practicing your passion is self care. This quote reminded me of it. 

My HS yearbook quote was ""Passion less people are no people at all."" Passion for my career was my brand, and my career was in progressive social change. For a very modest living, I empowered others to take strategic collective action on various issues for several nonprofits at the municipal, state, and national level. I had an incredible professional network, and stellar reputation, even after being fired once. I never had to look for a job, I had never been unemployed for long. Often I was recruited and hired quickly. 

Getting harassed for two years by my supervisor, while he built a case to fire me, is up there with my loss of safety when my partner moved to Europe after an amicable break up. 

When I believed getting fired was imminent, I considered an impulsive attempt for the first and only time. I did not see the point of anything after that, no future, no meaning. Understandably it took a toll on me. The last of my self worth, confidence, passion, my identity, purpose, and any resilience I had left. 

Passions (unlike jobs) give us meaning and purpose, enjoyment, and often community. All which are critical to cope with the inevitable tragedies stress and loss in life. Suicidal ideation is a result of high and prolonged levels of trauma and stress, paired with low levels of resilience and support. We don't want to die, we just cannot see another resolution or end to our suffering. And as with addiction, progress is not in a linear trajectory.  Relapse is to be expected but can be prevented."
BPDlovedones,f0xa3ds,t1_f0wpg3m,1569026272.0,"Crazy it even mentions bpd. 

I've heard the song a million times in college, but never looked up the lyrics.

I am busy learning about bpd because my father was diagnosed bipolar, I haven't had any contact in over 15 years. But I relate so much to this sub, and a book I bought called growing up with a bpd parent or something. 

It was hard, as a little girl, to empathize or understand him, or believe that he loved me. I also identify with posts I've read about being in a relationship with someone with NPD. So I'm guessing he could have been undiagnosed BPD or NPD or just didn't self identify. But he was the most manipulative person I've ever known."
BPD,f0x7b4a,t1_f0x567d,1569023845.0,"I guess my point is about my individual therapist.

She did not give me the impression she gave a damn about what happened to me in the end. She seemed to be happy to be rid of her legal liability, the possibility she may be investigated if I did die by suicide, rather than how I transitioned back after my ""higher level of care"" was complete.

This triggered my feeling that I am a burden to everyone, including to ""professional help"". Worthlessness, and trust are big issues, I did not even scratch in the three allotted months my insurance approved. I've struggled with ptsd for three years now. Few facilities and therapists provide good trauma therapy in my experience. 

Thankfully the care I got at this place  was the first time, after years of therapy, that I actually saw a point and benefit to talk therapy. They called to check on me, when my mom called them for help. My ex-therapist never called me back or to check in on me while I was in the IOP, I was never in patient. 

My point is I've never had a good therapist. My appointment with my newest therapist is Monday. I wish there was a yelp for therapists. Wish me luck."

TrueOffMyChest,f0q61xy,t3_cylug5,1568854524.0,"The problem with this thread is assuming the goal is not to be racist, and hold ""white supremacist"" beliefs. While individual prejudice is a problem that eats away at our own humanity like you have described, the assumption that you can be ""not"" racist or neutral (like some ""liberals"" who believe the system is fine its just some ""bad apples"") is the problem. Racism is a system that privileges white people in all areas of life. 

Learn about how it is systemic here https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/podcasts/the-daily/1619-project.html

So as MLK said ""In the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends."" That is why there is no neutral. By challenging racism in small and big ways we act to restore it. There are people who support racist beliefs, and policies that perpetuate white supremacy, and those who challenge and speak out against them. No one is perfect, we are all in this system, including some people of color who also support these beliefs and policies. 

So I appreciate your courage and intention. I would offer, as a person of color, that you read

As a former student and community organizer (shout out to the Midwest Academy) I forgot how much tactics like rallies are good, not just to recruit and energize people, but to demonstrate mobilizable power, leverage the media, and control the narrative. And none more sensitive an opponent to demonstration of power than the most insecure unstable and corrupt president we have ever had. So it has the added benefit is that it serves to make him unsettled and defensive. This election will be fun if not scary, because we are what democracy looks like.

Crushes,eydesly,t1_eyd9sab,1567017368.0,"I had my best friend hook up with the guy I was dating long distance and told her all about the sex in great detail and how I had to break up with him because I didn't think he was smart. And it was long distance so I was struggling through my feelings for a couple of months. I thought that was inappropriate enough, especially because she was suddenly avoiding me and then told me about it in retrospect. But her excuse was that I had dumped him. 

I find out because she had been having an affair with one of our tight circle of friends' fiancé. Her excuse for that was she wasn't that close with his fiancee although I would argue she was a sort of mentor. So finding out about my sort of ex, it didn't last long, was after I found out about the affair. She even explained that her self esteem was so low, the cheater had been pressuring her to have a threesome with another girl he was also simultaneously having an affair with too.

But 20 years later I know now that she was a survivor of abuse but as close as we were she couldn't tell me. I couldn't get past the betrayal then but now I am so regretful that I could not forgive her. Even though I had no interest in her eventual boyfriend. Who eventually became her ex boyfriend and last I heard was getting married to someone she met in grad school.

Yours is less crazy but worse. But maybe your friend also has low self-esteem. That makes people do these sort of things, even to their friends."
