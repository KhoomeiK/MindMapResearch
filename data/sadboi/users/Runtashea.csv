I was already fired from the shipyard and wasn't really qualified to bw anyway. And if I hate my current job, i know I'll hate the military.

I try the whole 'positive thinking' schtick before and it works...for five minutes at best. Reality quickly sets in and makes my want to cry. I have to go back in like an hour or so and I don't want to. I don't want to ever step inside another factory job again!"

I'm not including Michael because he wasn't the intended volunteer. Henry even said so himself, ""*And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you.* *Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want.* *I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be.""* So Henry clearly intended someone else to join him, although keeping a way out in case it the person who found the job wasn't his intended 'volunteer'. He was fortunate that he was also releasing Michael Afton, but Henry's dialogue always felt weird.

So my question is, who was Henry's hoping would volunteer? Who was Henry trying to kill?"
