atheism,fhhltkp,t3_f2xr2x,1581607041.0,"My coworker has the worst cognitive dissonance in regards to the Bible. He and I were having a conversation about we believed and the topic of biblical stories, lessons, and sin came up.

He agreed that if we took everything in the Bible literally and at face value it wouldn't make any sense and that many of the sins described in it were basically nonsense. Like having multi fabric clothing and no tattoos memorializing the dead and such.

Then, the discussion moved on and we talked about whether or not the Bible was just a collection of stories and whether it had been edited and changed over time. His response was, ""Well the Bible is the living breathing word of God. I believe everything in the Bible was spoken truthfully from God, to every last detail"".

So which is it? Is the Bible flawed and are there details people should overlook or is it straight from God's mouth and unfuckwithable??

He also went on to say certain sins like abortion and fornication are the actual sins we need to be worried about not silly stuff like not eating fish on certain days.

How can this logic exist?? God's word is infallible but you as an individual have the power to decide what of God's scriptures you choose to ignore?"

The funny thing is, I hadn't even considered that something I wanted to reach or was able to reach. My friend and I had taken some particularly strong LSD and were at my parents place listening to music and hanging out when we happened upon a very strong wave of the LSD. I was walking into my living room when I felt it come on and I basically fell straight to the floor, I didn't have any control over my body. The only way I can describe the feeling, is to say that I could feel what I perceive as my individual consciousness/soul being lifted from my physical self. It felt as though all my layers of thought, consciousness, judgment, and perception in general were being peeled away from me. And where I ended up, the only way to describe it was being in this pure domain. To put it simply it felt like that episode of SpongeBob where he ended up so far in the future there was nothing but his thoughts echoing around him. It was at this moment where I could sense the WHOLE connection, I actually described it to my friend after we came to as me ""touching the universal consciousness"".

When I came back I felt stripped clean, I knew what I needed to do with myself and I came to terms with a lot about myself. It was a very enlightening experience. Never quite had anything like that again"
