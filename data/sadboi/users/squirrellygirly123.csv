ballpython,fmqjiq9,t1_fmou9n2,1586300842.0,"My girl is older and when I adopted her from her previous owner, we adopted her old feeding schedule (regularly once a month, a medium large rat.) When she didn’t eat the first time on December 5 I tried 3 weeks later on New Year’s Eve. About every 3 weeks after that...The last rats I bought, I got a smaller size though because I was concerned that she would be intimidated by her usual meal after so long. As she ate this one but it isn’t very substantial compared to her usual, I am going to try to feed her the other one of that size in 2 weeks and then hopefully go back to a bigger size the month after that.

I have noticed (and apparently this is very common) that my snake is way more interested in non white rats. The more brown, grey, or black in the fur the more tasty! She just doesn’t seem to eat the white ones so I stopped buying them whenever possible. 

It’s confusing as well because she has definitely eaten them when they get moisture in their fur but I think she would much rather have a totally “dry” rat.  (I warm them up after defrosting in a ziplock plastic bag submerged in hot water from the tap.) Sometimes either the seal isn’t %100 or the tiny sharp rat claws tear a little hole in the bag which lets some water in during that process. The rat can be a bit drippy in that case... I usually dab it off on paper towel so the droplets don’t freak her out, but this may be unappetizing as well. 

Don’t know if that’s helpful at all! :)"

It affects my energy, my skin...further results include anxiety and depression because if I get a hangover and have no motivation then I feel useless and get mad at myself for not making better decisions.
