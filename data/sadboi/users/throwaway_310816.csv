EatingDisorders,fiaq8te,t1_fiap0n7,1582306284.0,Thank you!!
EatingDisorders,fiaof0z,t1_fialm56,1582305221.0,"Thank you for your kind words, they mean a lot! And thank you for taking time to participate in this"
EatingDisorders,fiaobwc,t1_fial59c,1582305170.0,"That's a great point! I actually thought of it as well, so I'm definitely considering taking this into account in the future and adding a wider variety of options. And thank you for taking time to answer all of the questions!"
UnsentLetters,f8awu58,t3_dzw583,1574416227.0,I get the fact that your situation must be really complicated and saying this to him/her would only make it more difficult. But please consider the possibility of maybe sending it. The other person deserves to know the whole truth.
UnsentLetters,f4k5ztp,t1_f4ichju,1571636809.0,I guess life gets funny like that sometimes. I really hope you find what's best for you! Take care
UnsentLetters,f4htvuc,t1_f4hqdqf,1571596058.0,"Wow, that made my heart smile!! Since I happen to love traveling (never traveled on my own tho), I really like the way this sounds. Thank you for your cool suggestion!"
UnsentLetters,f4eopy5,t1_f4edr1p,1571561188.0,"You honestly don't know how much your words have touched me right now! Because that very inkling that his words weren't completely honest is, I think, what keeps these feelings still alive inside of me. Because I know what I felt when I was with him, I know what I felt between us and what I lived. But it's a very complicated story. He is part of a religious group where I didn't fit in. A group I had to leave at some point because of the things I started realising were going on in there. It was a whole world - his world- where I could never belong. But everything is still so confusing. So that's why I'm afraid that this inkling I have is just a glimmer of hope, and not a real intuition. And I'm afraid of being ridiculous. 
But your words really made me think. And thank you!"
UnsentLetters,f4end20,t1_f4c5kla,1571560585.0,"Yes, I can definitely see the sense behind this perspective! The topic of dreams is certainly a really interesting one. Sometimes I see dreams as messages from the deepest places in our hearts. In a metaphorical sense. A view that quite fits with what you're also saying. So I'm definitely thinking about it. Thank you!"
UnsentLetters,f4eg7zk,t1_f4eczzb,1571557435.0,Take care and may you receive what's best for you!
UnsentLetters,f4ec6uf,t1_f4eah95,1571555587.0,Stay strong and take care of yourself! Wishing you the best
UnsentLetters,f4ea0d2,t1_f4dxmbq,1571554556.0,How beautiful!
UnsentLetters,f4e9zrh,t1_f4dc1yc,1571554548.0,"I've also been struggling with that process for quite a while now.. Take care and good luck with your own process! Also, I love the idea of Christmas miracles."
UnsentLetters,f4e9gvl,t1_f4cmude,1571554309.0,I'm sorry. Take care of yourself and I'm wishing you the best!
UnsentLetters,f4e96xg,t1_f4cijrv,1571554170.0,"Yeah, such bittersweet things sometimes."
UnsentLetters,f4e92w9,t1_f4cfrk0,1571554115.0,I'm sorry and glad at the same time that you do know this feeling. It feels nice to know you're not alone. Take care and best wishes to you!
UnsentLetters,f4e8srk,t1_f4c2kcx,1571553984.0,Hang in there and take care! May you get what's best for you!
UnsentLetters,f4e8q9c,t1_f4c2jwi,1571553954.0,"Thank you for your kind words, they really made me happy. Wishing you the best too!"
UnsentLetters,f4e8nin,t1_f4cydzl,1571553920.0,"I'm really glad it resonated with you. It feels good for me as well to be understood. Also, take care and I hope you get what's best for you!"
UnsentLetters,f4e8dol,t1_f4c8h7d,1571553799.0,"I'm wishing you the best! May all of us out there get the miracles we deserve... whatever they might be! You know how they say, sometimes blessings come in disguise."
UnsentLetters,f4e7ly5,t1_f4bxend,1571553446.0,"I definitely will, I definitely plan to do just that! Thank you. And just in case you needed to hear it too, I'm absolutely sure we will both survive!"
UnsentLetters,f4e7aj5,t1_f4czspv,1571553303.0,I really hope you get what's best for you!! Take care of your heart! And thank you
UnsentLetters,f4e6x5l,t1_f4cy3l8,1571553133.0,"Oh, it's never been about any of these things. Unfortunately, I can't really reach out anymore. Because there was once a time when I did - and his answer was the thing that made me realise it is time to give up. I'd love to be able to reach out. But this time I feel like it's all in vain and I'm still harbouring some feelings that would probably only bother him."
UnsentLetters,f4e5lf0,t1_f4c6j6l,1571552526.0,I hope you find your comfort and your miracle!
UnsentLetters,f4e5gj7,t1_f4bqxzx,1571552463.0,"Yeah, it sure can be quite overwhelming at times. Take care!"
UnsentLetters,f4e5d45,t1_f4bjrxo,1571552416.0,"Things are way too complicated and there are too many closed doors and obstacles in this whole story. I did reveal something similar to him a while ago though (before deciding to give up for real), but it ended with one of these closed doors I mentioned. So I feel like it's really useless by now and I should be way over it. Turns out it's not as easy as I thought! Thank you for your thoughts!"
UnsentLetters,f4e4lgc,t1_f4df5um,1571552069.0,I love these kind of moments that remind me exactly this!
UnsentLetters,f4e4exy,t1_f4c6y9q,1571551981.0,"It's really nice and warm though, feeling that maybe we're not complete strangers to each other when it comes to certain feelings and experiences. Take care!"
UnsentLetters,f4e3xuw,t1_f4bxjfb,1571551763.0,"Your words really touched me. I felt a lot of pain, sadness and some confusion behind them. I really get these feelings. Take care and I hope you'll find your peace!"
UnsentLetters,f4e2ybi,t1_f4cbt61,1571551320.0,"There was this one time when I decided to try exactly that. And I failed. But I guess life also got in the way almost from the very beggining of this whole story. Now, I'm a bit tired of being the only one who tries. But there still seems to be this lingering wish, sometimes bright and powerful, almost overwhelming - other times, really well hidden. And it can get really confusing at times. Thank you for your kind words!!"
UnsentLetters,f4e2941,t1_f4bwn0w,1571551010.0,And thank you for taking the time to put THIS into words. I'm really glad you feel this way.
UnsentLetters,f4e1rri,t1_f4c17r2,1571550799.0,I totally get that feeling. Wishing you the best!
UnsentLetters,f4e1pkg,t1_f4bp9g1,1571550772.0,"Somehow, this makes me feel so happy and so sad at the same time! Such a funny feeling."
UnsentLetters,f4e16xj,t1_f4c2vgd,1571550542.0,"Thank you for your heartwarming and beautiful thoughts !! And no, it was never about any of those things. However, there was once a time when I tried to reach out, since I felt it might be my last chance to do so (and there was something really big and strong inside my heart that was telling me he might feel the same). But it turned out I was wrong. So, as he closed that door, it was the time I decided to give up for real and never look back. But it's a bit more difficult than I thought."
UnsentLetters,f4e0d1b,t1_f4bwmha,1571550183.0,"I second this!! 
In my case though, it's not so much about mistakes, but more about a lot of other obstacles standing in the way and a lot of closed doors.
But I really hope your words reach out to those who need to see them, because they're beautiful."
UnsentLetters,f4dzrmp,t1_f4bo7to,1571549924.0,Thanks a lot and I wish you the same! Better days are surely awaiting us!
