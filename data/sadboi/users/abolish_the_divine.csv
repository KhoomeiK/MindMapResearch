the template he created isn't just linear progression, it's doing low reps at a fairly high % of your max (like bulgarian) and is high frequency like smolov, without the unnecessary volume. best of both worlds. 

the theoretical basis behind high frequency programs such as this is gaining neural efficiency through ""greasing the groove"".
