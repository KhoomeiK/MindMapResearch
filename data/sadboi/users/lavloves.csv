Makes me realize how precious he is and reminds me of all of the different reasons I love him, then I immediately feel like shit for thinking that way. 


As I’m thinking back, I’m fairly certain this is why I ended up cheating on guys back in highschool/had very toxic relationships. I would end up feeling like I didn’t love them anymore, or that I was bored, and so I would look for attention in other guys, I would also be too afraid to leave them because I didn’t want to hurt them.

She had a full double mastectomy, the surgeon did save her nipples, no breast reconstruction surgery, no implants, she wanted to for a while but then decided it wasn’t worth it. I will say I’m a CNA at the hospital she got the surgery at and the surgeon who did her mastectomy doesn’t have a good reputation, people commonly get really bad infections from him because he does things too quickly and isn’t always very thorough. I didn’t work there at the time or know this, or I would have pushed for a different surgeon for her. 

The fat that she has surrounding her breast area is what is dimpling up, and her nipple is crusting over, it’s only on her right breast area. When she was first diagnosed it was on her left breast. 

She often complains about pain in her legs. She takes opioids and has become reliant on them. She also uses kratom to help with the pain as well. So I’m sure those pills could definitely be contributing to why she’s in so much pain all of the time. 

She did do chemo and radiation, the works. 

I thought she should have been going to see him, I figured it was like protocol to go back often to make sure everything was going well, she hasn’t been in a long time. Idk how she’s been getting her cancer pills refilled if she’s not going to see him every few months. 


I know she’s really scared. I think her mindset is “if I don’t know about it I can’t be scared.” It’s really hard for me to get her to stick to anything, she will say she’s going to do something but then will back out last minute. I told my brother what’s going on and he said he didn’t know that she had cancelled again, he said there was a paper she needed to take up there to them but she kept forgetting. ( she has had a very bad memory ever since she went through chemo and radiation. ) he said he was going to persist on her to make another appointment again soon and keep reminding her. I guess that’s all I can go off of right now. I don’t believe she would read any books if I got any for her because I think she just hates the topic in general, which I understand, but she does need to have a better understanding of what’s going on in her body."

She will watch the dumbest or most disgusting movies as long as they’re horror. I’ve been at her house several times when a rape scene comes and I honestly get angry, and i always ask her  “How do you watch shit like this? It’s disgusting” She said “it’s just a movie, it’s not a big deal it’s all fake.” I don’t care. It’s like somebody saying they like the movie “A Serbian film” because it’s “really well done”."

bipolar,fmxpvfp,t1_fmxmhie,1586469568.0,"I’m pretty anxious about getting pregnant because of all of the mixed mood cycles combined with the already mixed moods haha. I agree with the judgemental aspect. If she gets worse, I will ask my regular doctor to recommend me to another place maybe in another town, hope I can do that anyway? I’m really glad that your psychiatrist is working with you and supportive of you, very important especially at a time like this. I’m sorry about what you’ve been going through and I hope you continue to do well in your pregnancy journey and improve your mental health ♥️"
DreamInterpretation,fmxiivw,t3_fxywkn,1586465634.0,"To me it sounds like you’re having anxiety. You can be having a good time with your friends, doing something casual, but there’s always a little bit of fear/anxiety in the back of your head all the time."

bipolar,fmxhrb3,t1_fmxh2u5,1586465223.0,"Yeah, I’m not exactly sure about her, but she’s the only psychiatrist in my town,You definitely made me feel a lot better knowing that though! 

She was really snarky when I told her we were using the pull out method, I essentially told her that we aren’t trying currently, but we wouldn’t be upset if I were to end up pregnant. she said I’m definitely going to get pregnant and that I shouldn’t be bringing a kid into this world until me and my relationship is stable enough ?? I mean we’re engaged, we have our own place, both have reliable good paying jobs, we’re living comfortably. I see her every few months and she knows me and fiancé are doing really good so I don’t know why she would say that. Maybe because we’re not married yet? Perhaps she was pulling a religious thing on me without being too obvious, I’m not completely sure. But it does make me wonder what she would put me on too now."
BipolarReddit,fmu879q,t3_fwnlx7,1586386381.0,"Caffeine gives me extreme anxiety. I can’t do it. I love coffee though so I drink decaf. 

Alcohol and anything mind altering like marijuana gives me major panic attacks, I used to not be like this, I used to be on Effexor and I was able to smoke like a freight train and get drunk and just be carefree. I know you’re not supposed to drink with those, I was an irresponsible teen. But after I got off of Effexor and got on Wellbutrin and Lamictal I just can’t do it anymore."
