kratom,fpclc4i,t3_gcjo4n,1588504839.0,"I used to get it a lot when I was just starting kratom and the only thing that helped was simply dosing less. So unless you're already dosing low or it is absolute essential for you to use this current dose, that is something I definietely suggest.

As for medications,  Cinnerazine always helped me a little (though it's by no means a cure) and is my personal medication of choice when it comes to wobbles and nausea, and kratom induced motion sickness. However it can make you feel a little drowsy and numb (depends on the individual, it always makes me feel a little blegh but some people don't notice that at all) so it should be more of a use-when-needed than a default option. But I'd still recommend cinnerazine a lot more than dramamine.

edit;   another thing is that for me the wobbles and motion sickness basically went away after I'd been using kratom for a few months. My body has kind of adjusted and now I get the range of mental effects without most of the physical like wobbles, nausea and constipation. I don't know if you're planning on using kratom long term, but if you are rest assured your body will adjust at least a little."

My job before that I was hypomanic, thought my coworkers were being rude so walked out the door and never came back. Actually I've done that twice. I don't take shit from people when hypomanic. And I can't handle stress when depressed. So yeah it kind of fucks with working.

I don't know what your diagnoses is, for me it's schizoaffective bipolar type meaning I have bipolar mood episodes but also some constant psychotic features, and this is one of them. This type of thing can also be the result of sleep deprivation and psychotic feautures in mania or depression, or after drug abuse. You should mention it to your doctor.

It's honestly a really important thing to talk about and I'm happy to see it being adressed. I'm still cycling myself and go from super sexually confidant in hypomania to extremely sexually insecure during depression. One thing that I've noticed is that I feel less good about sex and sexuality when I don't initiate. 

When I'm depressed I don't initiate because I feel sexually insecure and want my partner to show they are into me because I find that hard to accept. But then of course they can't always be in the mood, and my physical distance might send the signal that I'm not interested which will only make things worse.

Initiating once in a while might be a little scary or even awkward ,especially if you're afraid of being rejected like me (even if it's for very practical reasons, like they don't have time) I can take it personally. But it helps me feel sexually confident and like I can show my partner I love them. 

I used to struggle immensely with orgasm and it honestly just went away slowly as I became more confident, though the problem returns when depressed. It has a lot to do with pressure. I'm not a sex guru and this isn't really a sex reddit so I won't go too far into the practical side of things, but not seeing orgasm as a goal and not even ""wanting""  to orgasm can make the experience much better and ironically make it more likely to orgasm. 

Anyway hope any of that helps / resonates. I'm still in the process of figuring out sexuality and gender identity. I've been getting better at just not caring about it as much, but it's a thing that we need to keep ""practicing"", or we might fall back into insecure thoughts and behaviours."

This is actually not true, a manic episode can have full delusions and hallucinations. This is what can classifiy it as a 'manic' episode instead of 'hypomanic' (among other things).

I actually am diagnosed schizoaffective. The ""schizo"" tends to freak people (including me) out as if it's somehow worse. However it basically just means that you get hallucinations and or delusions outside of mood episodes, so also in normal mood. If the delusions/hallucinations are in a manic episode, that classifies you as Bipolar type 1.

If you're getting less stuff done, feeling unsocial, unproductive, etc, don't give yourself negative self talk for it. That will only make it harder to do things. If you tell yourself you can do something, it will at least be easy to start doing it. You may not be in the place you want to be, but you can still make the best of the situation .

It's amazing that you're here and trying your best to do good, so many people go for the ""ignore untill it's too late"" route with mental illness. Honestly I'm not sure if I can give any good advice but I'm very bored, sick and have a whole lot of time to fill with reddit so I'll give it my best shot! I have bipolar (schizoaffective) and have been in a committed relationship for years. There's been many points where I thought it wouldn't work but despite the major (sometimes MAJOR) problems encountered that you wouldn't find in a typical relationship, we always end up in a good place.

*Do we have what it takes?*

I know this was probably retorical but hell yes! It's all about commitment and you don't have to think too much towards the future, is what my experience has taught me. If it works now (even if it's difficult) it can continue to work.

*What does it take to make a bipolar  relationship work?*

Ofcourse there's no one golden tip or anything, but something I can really reccomend is (if your girlfriend allows it) to meet her psychiatrist if possible , and be involved in knowing how bipolar works and what to do in certain scenarios, discussing those things together with your gf. (if you haven't already done this).

*Is she doing so bad because I’m not a good enough  parnter?*

Honestly sometimes a mood disorder is like throwing dice. We can be doing so bad in times when things are good, and so good in times where things are bad. As long as you can stick around and keep calm (I don't know how my partner can at this point lol) things will turn around for the better at some point. Sometimes it just takes time.

*What should I know? How can I be the best partner for her? I know that  being in a relationship with someone who has bipolar takes a little more  effort and we both need to make sure we are taking good care of  ourselves. I just wanna prepare myself and learn all I can because I  love her and never want to give that up.*

I can't give enough praise for your attitude and commitment. The only final advice I can give is to keep calm and try to distance mood related symptoms from true feelings. To give a specific example, in my last depressive episode I became convinced my partner would leave me, which caused me to act very irrationally and basically just unloving. We worked things out by talking about it afterwards (although there's still some damage recovery to be done). If my SO would listen to me then and take it personally, see that as who I am, and not a part of an illness, they wouldn't be able to work through it. I just feel shitty for being at the other side of this. I wouldn't want to be with me. That's why I often feel convinced they'll leave me; it's what I would do. So I think the best thing you *can* do is to show you care, be consistent  and calm, and just stick around. Being reliable is the most important thing. I'm sure you'll have great times together :)"
bipolar,fk9jy1v,t3_fh2glz,1583977538.0,"I've learned that *anyone* would want an apology; even if they are angry, and even if it doesn't fix things, an apology makes things better, as it can relieve that emotional stress for both parties involved. 

Honestly, what happens when you get in touch is anyone's guess as we don't know what it is you did exactly (although I'm assuming it's probably not as bad as you think, we tend to overblow these things in our heads) and don't know what type of person she is, I think what's most important here is just reaching out and being honest, but not with the intent of becoming friends again or clearing your conscious. Just an honest apology. 

I hope I don't come off as condescending, I'm saying this because so so often in the past including recently, I've noticed I'm not as good at apologizing as I'd like to be. That's because I'm doing it for myself and not for the other person."

bipolar,fjm0zsi,t3_fdz5fo,1583459087.0,Yeah that sucks. Hey at least there's always a way you can turn any place into a little party. Who needs nightclubs when you have a place to live and a soundsystem? party's right here
bipolar,fjm0rco,t3_fe5bxb,1583458931.0,"I'm in exactly  the same boat right now, especially relate to being so tired and awake at the same time. In a way my body feels a little exhausted and my mind feels a little ""done"" , but at the same time I can't sit/lay still and my mind keeps jumping from place to place. 

Word of advice;  try to not worry about sleeping as much, and use your sleeping time for resting. It may sound weird, but just laying in bed, closing your eyes and resting like that, even if it's just 30 minutes, can really turn your mood and your energy around to a more relaxed state. Even if you can't get any sleep, just resting like that can help you to feel a little more sane."

*-At what age did you first notice/suspect bp symtoms and what did you do?*

I only had depressive symptoms at first. I was depressed for a long time but mostly in denial. Then I had a hypomanic episode, had the time of my life, only to crash to depression afterwards, despite thinking previously that my depression had been cured because my life had improved. The depression that I got in then was so bad that I totally isolated, had some hallucinations/delusions, untill a friend reached out and urged me to get help so that's what I did.

*-What do you do to control yourself if medication isn't yet available?*

I'm currently not on medication, what helps me the most is being in social contact with trusted people every day. Being isolated is my biggest trigger for mood changes and psychosis. Also trying to sleep at least 6 hours a day, although Im failing that hard at the moment. And a big one is , whatever your problem is, keep in touch with someone you trust and tell them when and if you need help.

*-How long do your episodes last? And how do you keep track?*

I used to keep track in a journal. Then I used a mood app (daylio) for a pretty long time. Then I got kind of tired of it and haven't been keeping track lately but might get started again. My hypomania lasts anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks. Depression usually lasts at least 4 days and at worst it can be months. Had only one or two ""full""  manic episodes that only lasted a few days, with complete lack of sleep that always ended psychotic symptoms etc. 

*-Does  bp make you sometimes lose feelings for your SO like me? I can just  completely lose interest but later on love him again like nothing's  wrong and it scares me.*

Sadly... yes. this is particulary hard.. During my latest depressive episode, a few weeks ago, I became dead convinced my SO didn't love me and would leave me, and I felt absolutely nothing for them anymore. It was well... depressing. Now I feel a new spark and there's new respect between us , but I acted like a real bitch when I was depressed because I didn't value them as much as I should."
bipolar,fjlzkug,t3_fe5kae,1583458150.0,"It's okay to need to ramble sometimes. These thoughts seem pretty akin to depressive thoughts, do you think you might be in a depressive episode? 

in any case I can relate a lot. I have a piece of advice relating to this problem. The biggest challenge for getting started on tasks and being motivated is having self confidance that you can and will do it. If you actually believe you will do your chores and that you'll be able to do them, it makes doing them so much easier. if you're worrying about how you're not doing your work or what you're supposed to do, and employing negative self talk to yourself about what you want to do ('you didn't even do x and y today! so lazy' is one I often think to myself), it will demotivate you and prevent you from getting started on things, because you already believe you won't or can't do them. In any case, this is kind of the crux for me. things might work differently for you.

Another way more practical tip, is to make a short list of things you want to do, and just do the very easiest one on a day. As long as you do at least 1. Once you do something, it's easier to continue that flow and do other things. So don't stress about what you want to and need to do, just start with a tiny thing and see where that takes you. hope any of this helps, I know how shitty it can feel to feel unproductive."
bipolar,fjlz4pb,t3_fe08oi,1583457852.0,"Although seroquel isn't typically seen as an antidepressant it can have really beneficial antidepressant effects especially for bipolar, though you need to go through a sedated period first when getting started on it.

bipolar,fjlykxf,t3_fe4oxx,1583457484.0,"I'm going to do it in the form of ""you will"" , because you will stop being depresssed and some point and experience all this goodness so here we go.

You'll feel safe and loved by the people around you instead of doubting yourself and others, you'll enjoy music and art and hobbies, you'll do multiple things in a day without becoming exhausted, you'll want to live and want to love and you'll look back at the past and the future and accept it how it is.

Depression can be a mess for your world view and self identity. I recently came out of a very severe although relatively short depression that left me questioning all my relationships and interests, and there's  a world of difference now. just gotta hold on and keep on trucking a little longer, sometimes our stupid brains take time to catch up. you got this"
bipolar,fjlyaai,t3_fe1rd7,1583457284.0,"Yes! I totally know how you feel in fact this is one of the most relatable things I've read on here. I fear going to bed and going to sleep , even when I'm tired and in a good mood.

I hate gambling with my mood like what seems to happen in sleep."
bipolar,fjly2to,t3_fe3165,1583457147.0,"Be in a safe place with trusted people. First time for me was way too intense and the onset/comeup gave me the worst panic of my life (at that point). The experience ended up being very therapeutic though. It hasn't ever made me manic, although that doesn't mean that applies to everyone with bipolar. Be sure to be in a safe trusted place with trusted people throughout the whole experience, even when you think you're pretty much sober again. after effects are sneaky and can leave you suspectible to paranoia and delusions"

bipolar,fjjezc1,t3_fdr3st,1583393113.0,"Lovely! I think this is a great type of art and one of my personal faves. I think conceptless or ""meaningless""  art is one of the most amazing ways to do art. It's like meditation. It's pure consciousness turned into art. Too much art nowadays focuses on concept, meaning and all those societal layers. Strip it down and art is just pure beauty, patterns , etc. It doesn't need meaning because there's inherent meaning in art itself, regardless of whether or not there's a concept. Art surpasses language."

The sedation was very managable on it, but it did trigger my RLS (restless legs syndrome). But if restless legs aren't a problem for you I'd look into trying it, as it does wonderful things for depression as well as mood stabilizing. Then again, the same can be said for Lithium and abilify. Honestly I can't give solid advice because I""m not a psych. Maybe a weak answer but I'd say bring all these concerns up with your psych, and really have a good discussion about making the decision. They should have at least a careful advice on which one would be best"
