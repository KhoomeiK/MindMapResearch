My discord is Malek#3257, looking forward to hearing from you!"
gangplankmains,fmy7vsk,t1_fmwigr0,1586480028.0,"Ranged matchups will always be rough for GP. Solarbacca has a video on GP vs Lucian check that out. Renekton is a really easy matchup for me, you need to poke the shit out of him early make sure any fight he tries to take with you, he’s already lesser health. Keep proc’ing your grasp then back into the bush to reset minion aggro. Like I said below, if you’re having a rough early lane, don’t be afraid to go dorans blade longsword after corrupting potion. It’s really good for champs that constantly want to fight you/easier cs’ing under turret if you are constantly pushed. For wave management watch a couple YouTube videos that explain everything. You also want to try and time your backs for objectives spawning, so try to just shove lane to turret then go back and be there when Drake spawns instead of having to use TP (Which is also fine) it’s all really situational, you’ll know the more you play. So if you’re doing well, then you need to go around to lanes and help spread that lead. You’re not gonna solo carry on GP. It’s really hard. Possible, but hard. So let’s say you solo killed top a couple times, you’re really ahead. You can afford to lose a wave or 2 top, for a TP play bot side, or even mid. Sacrifice some resources for yourself to try and get your team back in the game. Especially with TP buff now, don’t be afraid to use it instead of just trying to save it for that ONE fight. I don’t have an EUW account I’m sorry but you can add me on discord Malek#3257"
gangplankmains,fmy6y8n,t1_fmwor9z,1586479447.0,"Sett is easy you just have to play back, sit on a barrel. He Q’s auto barrel when he’s in it. Save your W for his ult, as soon as he ults you press it. It’ll be like nothing happened you’re in the same spot no suplex. Camille is rough because you need to know the damage, play off her CD’s, bait you going in for a cs to bait her W. You can sometimes juke the E if you walk sideways instead of just running away from it. What helps me in this matchup is when she ults, she puts herself in my barrels so that’s an easy double passive proc + damage. Ninja tabis also essential in this matchup, because you’ll have to match them in that side lane and that item is broken. Oh also if you’re having rough early game just go dorans blade, longsword for sustain and easy cs’ing (sorcerer creeps are 1 auto after turret shot) Get enough gold for next back sheen. Control ward every single back. You want to prevent any plays happening, so get lane prio.. ward deep.. etc. You want to be pro-active in the game. TP is for your team, or rough matchup. Ignite is if you think you can get an early kill and snowball that lead. I commented down why I don’t like mid but play whatever you like!"
gangplankmains,fmy66ix,t1_fmxtbzx,1586478969.0,"The thing I don’t like about mid GP is you don’t have pressure early like many other mid laners. Your damage isn’t the same so 2v2 are a joke if your opponent knows what they’re doing, you roaming with high cd barrels not really viable. That’s just my opinion though! I do understand that some matchups are so free with ignite pre-6 you can bully hard get a couple kills. But not everyone is gonna play haphazardly like that."

gangplankmains,fmwgwh1,t1_fmwfu0m,1586446369.0,Lmao. True!
gangplankmains,fmwgv8d,t1_fmwfyxj,1586446351.0,"I play him Top. So honestly GP is in a pretty bad state right now, you need to learn to play for the team. You going even Top and farming well is 100% a win, because you will outscale most of your laners. A lot of the games in that elo are bloodbaths, GP isn’t really the best option there because he thrives in co-ordinated team play. You need to have good macro and understanding of the game before you can improve with the champ. So learn wave management/matchups. KNOW YOUR DAMAGE. Power spikes, etc. There was a post here earlier by u/gangplank_main great video with build paths and a lot of crucial stuff for GP. I learned from Solarbacca/Tobias Fate and doing research but also playing, limit testing. Add me on League if you ever have any other questions. Goodluck!"
