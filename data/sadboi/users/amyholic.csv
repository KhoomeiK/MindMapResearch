Borderline,ff9d7c3,t1_ff2ysbl,1579710417.0,"No I didn't, I actually felt closer to the doctor that diagnosed me. It was like someone was finally seeing me clearly for who I was. I knew there was something different about me, I always felt there was something 'wrong' with me. When the doctor confirmed it I felt like I could finally start figuring out where I belong in the world. I also shifted to denial and despair, don't get me wrong. Being given a list of unflattering personality traits and being told that's you is unsettling. Everyone deals with their diagnosis in different ways. My fiance has been supportive throughout the whole ordeal. He doesn't tell me how to feel, or what to do. He's just there for everything, even when I make stupid decisions with my BPD. Having the support of someone that will never judge you or try and dictate how you should live your life is the most powerful support I could get."
Borderline,ff2n5g3,t1_fexwfa1,1579514325.0,"It really was. The first thing I did when I got diagnosed was Google the disorder, and the internet is not very kind with its description of BPD. The idea that this disorder is life long and can sabotage almost every area of your life is devastating. For a while I didn't quite believe that I had it. I thought about the diagnosis questions and my answers. I was in denial. It wasn't until I watched a video on YouTube about a man with BPD that it hit me. I cried after watching that video, because I realised his circumstances and issues were almost identical to mine. Maybe your wife needs to hear about BPD from people with BPD, that really helped me."

Just after he turned 1 years old we got another puppy for him to play with. The experience has actually been so much easier. New puppy learns A LOT from older dog. They play together all day, sleep together, share food, etc. The experience has been amazing. I brought older dog with us when we went to see the puppies to make sure they would be compatible. Older dog was actually a bit afraid of the puppy during the meet, but seemed to warm to him by the end of the visit. Everyone told me having two dogs can be awful and that I would regret it, but it's the best decision I could have made. We have had our hard times with them, they can encourage each others challenging behaviour, but it was worth it. New pup is on his way to being well socialised, he's only 4 months right now. Good luck with your 2nd pup!"

The therapist told us that one aspect of self care that people forget is hydration. If you're dehydrated you get headaches, you may feel dizzy, and it may put you in a bad mood. He actually showed us a chart of urine colours, and told us to strive for clear urine. If your urine is even slightly yellow you could do with another glass of water.

BPD,fc57lrn,t3_eg58sa,1577447335.0,"When I was first diagnosed with BPD I found it extremely difficult to separate myself from the disorder. I didn't know who I was under the BPD. One thing that really helped me was making a mind map of all the things that are definitely 100% me and are not a trait of BPD. For example, I am good at baking and I always bake gingerbread for friends and family at Christmas time. No part of that is BPD, that's all me. Another is that I love playing video games, and collecting the memorabilia. Making this mind map has really helped me realise that I do have my own personality under this disorder.

My least successful relationships are with everyone other than my partner. I meet a new person, I am excited and thrilled to meet them and get to know them. I quickly befriend them, ask them to be my bridesmaid, fall in love with their character. Then I find a small flaw and the illusion is shattered. I am no longer mesmerised, and I don't want to see them anymore. I go cold and distance with them, and eventually they stop trying to talk to me.

About a month ago I started smoking weed with my friend and I've found it extremely helpful with my BPD and anxiety. It stops the bad thoughts, neutralises them. It lets me move past the bad emotions and do things. I struggle with daily tasks like cleaning, but the other day I took a few puffs of weed and found the motivation and energy to clean my kitchen, cook dinner, and bin all the moldy food in my fridge. I still don't like the taste of weed, and I would never classify myself as a stoner, but weed really helps me so I smoke it when I need it. I live in the UK and it makes me feel frustrated that I have to go through shady dealers to get it. I wish it was legal so I didn't have to smoke it, or put myself in danger by meeting these random dealers. I will also say that weed can sometimes have a negative effect on me. When the weed wears off I find the bad thoughts can sometimes come back even stronger than before. I still feel that it benefits me overall though."
