2 tips I learned that helped me to combat the nausea:

1. Take it at night so that you will sleep through most of the more immediate side effects.

2. Make sure you take it with food. I like to take it with my dinner, and I eat half of my food, take it, then eat the other half. I sandwich the pill in my meal. It works pretty well for me this way."

I‚Äôm also extremely sensitive to others. I have very low self esteem because I care so much what others think. But it‚Äôs not just of me. I care about everything; no matter what someone does or says to me I either have little to no emotion towards it or I feel 100% full blown hyper-emotion.

I also have bouts of paranoia and anxiety that vary in intensity each day.
