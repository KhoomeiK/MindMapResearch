depression,f94up9d,t1_f94u02q,1575104408.0,"Oh yes, my mom just told me today that she thinks I dont have a mental illness and that I just dont want to do anything like getting a job. I had two job interviews a few weeks ago and I didnt get any job. The amount of energy I had to bring not only to write applications but also to go to the interviews was so much and she doesnt understand how exhausted I feel now and how I cant just write the next one and keep going especially after I basically had two more losses.
Not only do I have these thoughts which make me blame myself but Im actively getting blamed from a person around me. I feel defeated.
Thanks for the comment though. I didnt expect such a thoughtful answer to my confused rambling. Viewing yourself as a 3rd person has helped me in the past. I guess sometimes I forget how to do that."
mentalhealth,ew31nss,t3_cmi04a,1565061536.0,"I never went to a CSU but I have to check into a mental hospital in a few hours so I can understand you somewhat. I'm also scared. Leaving home is scary. But I'm sure the experience will be good for me and I'm sure it's going to be good for you too, since the people there are trying to help and also know how to help. Good luck!"
depression,ew30iwc,t3_cmcier,1565060635.0,"Yeah a lot of people think that way. My mom keeps telling me about her co-workers mental health issues and that she's just lazy and doesn't want to work. I feel like a lot of people have their own issues and look down on someone, whos depressed, because, in their eyes, these people crumble under the pressure, which they themselves repress. So this attitude often comes from people with mental health problems themselves and or people who are just ignorant on mental health. Don't let those people get you down."
depression,ew2zcng,t1_evu2s2u,1565059732.0,"Change is hard indeed. But I feel like I'm at a point where I have to change something. Thanks for your support. And I'd love to report back :)
Quick question: If I comment on this post will people, who already commented on the post, see that I posted a comment? And if not, is there anyway to report back so the people on this post get notified?"
depression,ew2z238,t1_evu8tij,1565059512.0,"Yeah, I really need to get on a schedule and stop spending all day in bed. Thanks for telling me about your experience. It already sounds better than I anticipated."
depression,ew2yw39,t1_evuugbn,1565059388.0,Thanks a lot for telling me. I hope I'll meet people like that who I can talk to. I appreciate that you told me your experience.

depression,ew2y7iv,t1_evw0vsx,1565058885.0,Oh alright. I'll try to take my feelings more seriously. It's hard sometimes. It feels like my judgement is impaired.
depression,ew2y0gf,t1_evvfoih,1565058741.0,Thanks!
depression,ew2xzyb,t1_evv9cud,1565058731.0,That makes sense.

depression,ew0j4x8,t3_cm2i0a,1564991451.0,"The Youtube lets players ""GameGrumps"" always make me feel less lonely. You should check them out if you haven't already. They can be silly, but they also have serious conversations on occasion. It's easy to fall asleep to their banter. I can recommend you their Super Mario Sunshine playthrough."
mentalhealth,ew0ij1e,t1_ew0i329,1564990603.0,"
That makes sense. Thanks for your advice. I will take that into account."
mentalhealth,ew0hjt8,t3_cm3d5w,1564989274.0,My friend has mental health issues and is taking drugs. She smokes weed and takes stronger stuff like cocaine. She gets the drugs from her boyfriend. I already told her multiple times that she has to stop but she keeps downplaying it. I already made her see a therapist but I don't know how to make her stop taking these drugs. If she read this post she would probably brush it all off like she always does.
depression,evxb51x,t1_evuzaqc,1564887059.0,Thanks. That makes me feel a bit more hopeful. I'm glad your're feeling better :)

depression,evxaqsl,t1_evuh712,1564886730.0,"Yeah it makes sense that depressed people think their problems are less severe, since they think of themselves as less valuable. Thanks for your advice."
depression,evxal8r,t1_evv5jkj,1564886603.0,I definately struggle with excessive self-criticism. It's really hard for me to seperate the truth from my feelings. It stresses me out extremely to not if my thoughts are true because my judgement is so impared. Thanks for explaining this aspect. It helped me to understand where my worries come from.
depression,evxa2b9,t1_evv4nez,1564886168.0,I hope you read the comments on this post. Many of them took some of my original worries away or at least made them less severe. I hope they will do the same to you.
depression,evx9wrf,t1_evv4hiv,1564886041.0,Yeah that's true. Those thoughts are pretty alarming.
depression,evx9umo,t1_evv3z6x,1564885994.0,Thanks a lot :)
depression,evx9tu8,t1_evv34jv,1564885976.0,That makes sense. Thanks for your advice :)
depression,evx9ser,t1_evuzn69,1564885943.0,"Yeah I noticed that theme while reading all the comments. I guess it makes sense, since if you're depressed you often think you're less valuable than others. Thanks for your support :)"

depression,evx91m0,t1_evunrx9,1564885340.0,"Fortunately I only had to wait two month, since I'm in Germany. People shouldn't have to wait 9 months or years for this kind of help. That sounds ridiculous to me. Stay strong, I hope you'll be able to go there soon."
depression,evx8rg1,t1_evul4id,1564885109.0,"I'm glad you had that experience in group therapy. It must be a great feeling when others tell you those worries you had all the time aren't valid and that you deserve the help as much as they do. 
Your story helped alot. Thanks for sharing :)"
depression,evx8doe,t1_evujnst,1564884796.0,"I often felt like running away, leaving it all behind.  Its a nice idea, but really won't solve anything. People, who say you're faking it simply don't understand the severity of a mental illnesses. I've had that experience with my mother. Her lack of empathy comes from ignorance about my condition. I feel like the people, who don't take you seriously are similar that regard. In the end you know how you're feeling and you know that you're not faking it and I believe you and so will other people who aren't ignorant. I hope you're getting help buddy and please never stop caring about yourself. I'm glad you shared your thoughts and wish you the best of luck with everything :)"

depression,evx7lfl,t1_evuyxe5,1564884143.0,"You're right, thanks alot. I guess I just needed to hear someone say that my problems aren't invalid. I was just so unsure about it."
depression,evx7hy9,t1_evutdv0,1564884063.0,"Thanks alot. I noticed that my fear comes mostly from being afraid that others judge me, because they think my problems are less severe. But you're right. I would never laugh at someones mental health issues and I have the feeling most people also wouldn't. So thanks for your support!"
depression,evx77x8,t1_evuhc3d,1564883834.0,"From all these comments it seems like depressed people tend to think of themselves as less valuable, which makes them think that they're problems are unimportant. Thanks for telling me about the depression imposter syndrome, I haven't heard of that before.
Thanks and whatever you're going through, I wish you the best :)"
depression,evx6vct,t1_evtqxad,1564883553.0,"I'm sure you can do it too. When I feel really bad I get in this state of not caring about alot of things. That's probably not healthy but it's part of what made me agree to go into the hospital. I just stopped caring if it went well or not. The outcome didn't really matter to me, since I'm hopeless most of the time anyway. I hope that made at least a bit of sense. Its hard to explain for me. I just hope you get help if you feel bad :)"

depression,evul7ml,t1_evuk71y,1564798410.0,I'm sorry you'll have to pay a massive bill. People shouldn't have to pay an incredible amount of money for health care.

It's good to hear from someone, who already experienced all of this. 
The fact that I don't have to go to the group sessions the first few days already calms me down a bit. 
I also hope you're doing better now."
depression,evub0ak,t1_evtqndf,1564790274.0,"Thanks alot. It's really important to me that people are nice there. But I guess it makes sense that they are, since they're all going through bad stuff and therefore can show alot of empathy."

I'm sorry to hear that you attemted suicide. I hope your time in the mental hospital helped you and you're feeling better today."
depression,evua305,t1_evtyv2j,1564789566.0,"That makes sense. I mean, I also wouldn't say that someone doesn't deserve help just because my problems are worse than theirs. Thanks for your advice."
depression,evu9tvw,t1_evu7cw6,1564789374.0,"Thanks alot for telling me your experience. It kinda calms me down to hear from someone, who already went through this.

lonely,euc06py,t1_eubzl4n,1563661483.0,That's true. Most people I know make assumptions about others. Maybe thats why I feel like everyone else does too. But you're right. At some point it doesnt matter what any random person thinks about you.
