If you think you might lose your job, I‚Äôd also think about doing some informational interviews with alums from your college. It‚Äôs basically just meeting up and talking about their job, industry, with the goal of getting closer to the job you want.

Now I‚Äôm going to stick with one job for that five years, god willing. Bouncing from job to job doesn‚Äôt look good, and I know I need significant administrative experience to ever be able to move up. Part of what happened was that I quit my last job to travel to Italy for two months. And yes that was a once in a lifetime experience, but if I had to do it all over, I would have just went for a week and kept my old job. 

But especially with how the job market is right now, there‚Äôs not much hope. To get a job I want in Policy, I need a masters. Adding thousands to my already huge student loan debt. And then will that job pay enough to allow me to pay back the debt?
