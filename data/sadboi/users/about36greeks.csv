carnivore,fot55yr,t1_fot1ko6,1588044883.0,Keto actually did ! I had a Candida overgrowth aswell so I killed that off while On keto and then continued for 10 months . I wasn‚Äôt on any meds . I think keto might even be better to gain weight .. I had 2 avocados a day and that was an extra 500 calories right there . Once I started getting closer to my weight goal I cut the plants . I‚Äôm really not a big fan of eating them but yeah I was doing avocados with some olive oil 2 times a day and that gave me a bunch of calories to gain weight . I can do both ways of eating and be fine but I just prefer carnivore .
carnivore,fosyl1h,t3_g99xko,1588040773.0,I had ibd and put on 40 pounds in 7-8 months eating this way . Slowly upped my dairy as I couldn‚Äôt handle tons at first . I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 220 now .

Life is just so random and the fact we can lose our loved ones at any moment is what causes my depression the most .

I bet you have one. I had to do carnivore plus add in things like apple cider vinegar , oil of oregano and garlic for 2 weeks to kill it off . My digestion has been great ever since as long as I eat low carb . And do you take any supplements ? I was taking a plant form iron supplement for awhile as I was anemic due to my ibd and it actually made everything worse . Now I‚Äôm just eating liver 2 times a week to get my blood count back up"

I‚Äôm not a bad person , I know what‚Äôs right and wrong despite not believing in a god ect and if I die and I was wrong and god doesn‚Äôt let me into this heaven even though I was still a good person than I don‚Äôt think I wanted to be there in the first place .

I also have a low mcv (smaller than normal red blood cells) I wonder if there is a connection . Everything else on my bloodwork was basically normal . My naturopathic doctor told me it was causing my symptoms and it can take time to correct . He said to just add more iron to my diet rather than taking pills .

Hematology,fnif2nq,t1_fnie7sz,1586978905.0,Okay sounds good . I just know most iron supplements are really hard on my gut . I was surprised how much it improved in 5 months just from eating liver and steak more frequently. My naturopathic doctor said improving my mcv could take a few months but if I‚Äôm not in a disease state it‚Äôll get better . Low mcv means my Rbc are smaller than normal right and the higher RBC is to compensate for that ? Thank you for all your replies by the way
Hematology,fnid8wq,t1_fnicyqz,1586978034.0,Yes one doctor said I should make sure to keep eating iron rich foods and maybe take a small supplement but another said it wasn‚Äôt necessary so i was confused because I know iron overload is a thing

Now I still won‚Äôt do fast food but if I go to a sit down restaurant and get steak a baked potato and salad and they used an oil I didn‚Äôt like it won‚Äôt kill you just once a week . Obviously I would prefer they used higher quality . I also found a few places in my area that do use good ingredients . There‚Äôs an Indian donair style place that does rice potatoes fried in olive oil and garlic and shredded chicken or lamb . I go there often so you just have to find a few places that are high quality and sooner or later you‚Äôll be able to eat out with no problems
