In my case, it helps me to read novels and painting."
relationship_advice,fjiumjw,t3_fdodfw,1583376116.0,"I don't know if it's going to help or not, but as we grow older we need to select those who will be in our inner circle. We need to select them base on their effect to our mental health (this is most important I think). Yes, it's going to be a little bit lonelier than before, but do you prefer quantity over quality? Are you willing to let your mind be tired because of the interaction or rather have peace of mind? 

Being alone is not so bad, too. You can explore yourself more, explore new interests that you haven't thought before. Maybe it's time to grow up more, and perhaps a little bit distance with your current friends going to help you become a better person."

mentalillness,felv8e0,t3_eprazt,1579231774.0,"First meeting on therapy usually you fill out some form or questionnaire or your therapist taking history of your life in general (like since when you feel anxiety, what happen when you feel it, etc). 

It's okay if you cry or have difficulties in telling your history, the therapist understand. Then s/he will explain to you what will both of you working on the next sessions, and perhaps what you should do at home.
