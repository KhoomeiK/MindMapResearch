She was a sub. Our real teacher (she was a great teacher by the way) had to get her wisdom teeth out, and she announced we would have devil incarnate Mrs. Ankle for three days (Mon-Wed). Everyone in the class cheered, except me and my best friend. We just exchanged worried glances, and I told him, ""She can't be that bad, right?"" (We had her as a sub once in science, we both hated her, everyone else was blind to her inner devil).  On monday, as I walked into the class late, she gave me the most deathly stare humanly possible, and instructed me to sit on the floor with the rest of the class, then asked my name. ""U/immobilerobin44,"" I replied trying to sound confident, but so intimidated I could barely stand up. She then did roll call, then asked what we were working on. Someone told her spelling, so the devil asked where the books were. She found them, and searched through them till she found mine. Flipping through my work, she found an error and read the sentence aloud to the class. Then put me down multiple times. She made the next few days hell, (making me redo work multiple times, etc). Then on the third day, she got 'fed up' of my 'crappy work' so me and 2 other friends got our work basically done by her. I remember waiting in a line, and hearing her asking me to ""come here"". I didn't respond instantlty, so she grabbed me by the wrist, and digging her claws (fake nails) into my skin deliberately. I just stared at her after that which she replied with ""what boy?"" Then made me sit down at next to her desk. (This was witnessed by others, and apparently happened to other students). (It is also illeagal in the country I am from for a teacher to touch a student).Thank god this ended half a day early,  when a student spent the better part of the last 2 days on an art/maths task, and Mrs. Ankle scribbled on it, then ripped it up in front of the whole class. (I didn't see this, me and 2 friends were coloring outside). What we did see though was the student run out the room crying, (with their work) and approach the vice dean, then explained to her what happened. (Mrs. Ankle was known to be a bit different, and had done things simillar to this before). She then got kicked out the school half a day early, and replaced with a nicer sub.

(By the way, her real name isn't Mrs. Ankle, but anyone who knows her probably remembers this 'Joke')"
