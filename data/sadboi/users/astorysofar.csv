Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is an infectious disease that most often results from a scratch or bite of a cat.[4] Symptoms typically include a non-painful bump or blister at the site of injury and painful and swollen lymph nodes.[2] People may feel tired, have a headache, or a fever.[2]"

I'm a schizophrenic dad in my 30's on disability in Washington state.  I haven't slept much since this all started and it's getting worse.  Having schizophrenia is already terrifying enough, I hear my children cry for me a lot and I'm always hearing the most negative horrible things. 

Now though, I just know I'm going to die, along with my kids. I stayed alive for my kids, all I can think about is ending it before the suffering really starts.   I won't, I always say I won't.   I'm so scared.  There is no way to disconnect completely to not think about it, it's everywhere, I can't do tasks that take a lot of concentration or thinking, I can only play with the kids so much to get my mind off of this.  

I wake up soaked in sweat, I'm not currently medicated because Medicare has a spend down that I can't meet yet to be covered.   Which means my high blood pressure and diabetes meds are also on hold, making me high risk now.  I don't want to lose my wife and kids to this, I don't want to hear them suffer and cry in my head, knowing it's coming.   I'm Fucking scared."
