It isn't easy for me to go to a doctor in the first place.  Hell I haven't seen my family doctor in months because every thing I go in there for leads to ""so when are you getting gastric bypass surgery"" conversation.  Even though we've had the conversation many times and I've explained the healthcare system will not allow me to proceed with the procedure with my mental health problems and lack of social support system.

I just want to say to every doctor, ""I know"".  I've been hearing these things for 15 years.  I know.  The trouble is, no form of treatment has ever improved my mental health.

My point is, perhaps the ER doctor would rather you come in for treatment and not be afraid of the next lecture.  Your boyfriend has heard the lecture before.  Many, many times if he's been obese all his life.  There is no new information to offer.  What might happen though is he might decide not to seek treatment because he's sick of hearing the same thing over and over.

IAmA,fq13ugc,t1_fpydv75,1589041375.0,"See the [Costa Concordia incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Concordia_disaster#Situation_on_deck).  With a nice slowly sinking ship, that is staying relatively level for the first 30 minutes or so, and keep people relatively under control, and you might get every lifeboat loaded and launched safely.   But anything short of that, and it can be really difficult.  

Case in point, the Costa Concordia quickly listed 20 degrees to one side during the loading of the lifeboats.   This creates problems on both sides of the ship.  The side the ship is leaning toward the water, the lifeboats are going to swing away from the ship while being loaded.  This introduces a gap where passengers would have to jump from the deck of the ship into the the lifeboats.  The further the ship is tilting, the bigger the gap and the more this will slow down the loading process.

On the opposite side of the ship, the life boats will slam against the side of the ship while being loaded.  There won't be any gap to jump across, but when it comes time to lower the boat it will scrape all the way down the side of the ship.  The lifeboats are equipped with smooth metal ""skates"" on the side facing the ship to improve this situation a little bit, but it would still be a rough ride down.  If the ship tilts far enough during this process, the lifeboats may not make it to the water before the supporting cables run out of length, leaving the boat dangling several feet above the water, stuck.

In short, life boats as a concept are far from perfect.  Introduce a few challenges into the normal procedure and it can go pretty wrong, pretty quick."

Of those, you'd need at least 3 certified crew members (1 on the ship, 2 on the lifeboat) to conspire to launch a lifeboat in any way that won't end with everyone on the lifeboat dead or badly injured.  Not all crew members are trained and certified,  only the ones that are designated for operating the lifeboats.  Cruise ship life boats are highly dangerous to work with, and [they have killed a few times](https://www.jonesactlaw.com/library/are-lifeboats-killing-more-than-they-save/).

The lifeboat would be lowered to the water by the minimum crew to minimize risk, and then brought over to the pier and be loaded there.

So it's not something a lone person could sort of sneak off and do in the middle of the night.  There are too many steps involved that need to happen concurrently for one person to do it alone.

Also there will be a wind-up process that will now have to happen with significant notice.  They will need time to re-crew these ships when things resume and that is going to involve an absolutely massive hiring campaign.  Not all of the crew they've sent home up until now or whom are on their way home now will want to come back or be available to come back if they've found other work.

Therefore, any cruise booked throughout 2020 should be considered cancelled until you've seen the news that they are starting to rehire, because that process alone will take more than a month. Cruise ships have to have a minimum number of crew onboard at all times while operating, to fulfill emergency roles.  There is a huge list with a slot for every crew member and a description of what their duty is in the case of an emergency.  Generally there is a percentage of slots that are spare to allow for new hire training, but that percentage is small, probably no more than 10% for any ship.  So all new crew who are brought onboard will *also* have to fully complete their two weeks of safety training before that ship can operate sailings.  Also any existing crew that have had their training certificates expire while at home will have to re-train when they join a ship.  They too will be disqualified from emergency duties during commercial operation until they re-train.  This is normally handled with constant rolling training.  People are re-trained as their certificates are about to expire.  With everyone at home, safety certificates will still be expiring but people won't be able to complete their training for the most part (Filipinos are mostly an exception to this, they have a training centre in the Philippines for seamen so they arrive onboard having already certified).

TL;DR: Re-staffing and subsequently re-training this industry is going to be a logistical nightmare.  I would estimate it to be at least a 60 day operation."
WinStupidPrizes,fpb2kzq,t1_fpb1800,1588460783.0,"Capacity is the number of people that can be seated at any one time. If the restaurant can normally seat 100 then they will be allowed to seat 25.  Most restaurants do not operate over 50% capacity most of the time. They have the extra for when it gets busy. They simply won't be allowed to use all of it now. Also I would imagine there will be a trend toward encouraging people to finish up and free up seats rather than lingering after their meal. This will help serve more people at the same reduced capacity. 

Also this doesn't stop them from also taking takeout orders.

So this does not mean they will lose money."

AirBnB,fouet2s,t1_fouekei,1588082693.0,"I was told what I commented by a rep.  Turns out they don't always know what they're talking about (as I've seen from many things posted from hosts in this sub).  So for now I just monitor the superhost qualifications which are plainly visible to the host and as it stands, the advice I've been following has been correct. Response rate is 99%.  Have definitely not hosted everyone who's ever made an enquiry.  Have also never clicked decline even once."
AirBnB,foue43x,t3_g9lw65,1588082305.0,"Good advice provided from others.   Also remember you don't have to decline at all if you don't want to host them, you can just respond and leave it.  As long as you've responded to the booking request, taking no further action does nothing to hurt your Super Host status.  You can even tell them in a message that you're declining to host them, and still not click the decline button.  Doesn't harm anything, the calendar isn't blocked.  All good.  


Sure they could harass you after that point, and then you just report them for harassment."

FA30plus,fojbx9p,t3_g7rpqf,1587816153.0,"I (32m) feel this so hard every day.   Growing up as a teenage son to a single mother (was actually someone's mistress for most of the first half of my life, which she tried to keep separate from my sister and I...poorly) who discouraged me from dating really messed with my development in this way.  Looking back on my formative years now, there were many opportunities.  I never told the girl I loved how I really felt about her.  She's now happily married with two kids.  Even if that hadn't gone anywhere, I could have been with *someone*.  I will always wonder how things might have been different had I actually had some kind of decent male role model growing up.  I didn't and so I never really was taught how to be a man.  Mothers can tend to be protective in this way and I've often seen it's the father who gives their son that push to put themselves out there.  That balance was missing for me. Consequently I feel underdeveloped and unable to fit in with others.  I can't see anything I have to contribute to a relationship now, because I never learned. Now I'm basically just surviving from day to day, waiting to die."
