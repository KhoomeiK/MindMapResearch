So I just started to distance myself from everything and everyone. Day in day out just felld meaningless. Everyday was just another brick in a huge f-ing wall.
I spiraled downwards, faster than anyone, or myself could see. And literally the only way to feel anything was to use bad habits.

Friends literally had to drag me out of my room by my hair.
Same friends eventually dug me up and helped me out of that sinkhole.
I'm better now.

TLDR: Too stupid to see who's real and who isn't. ""Insert sob story here"" Eventually got better through real friends and a few talks over a few beers."

There are so many games out there, which have such a deep or interesting story. Also, you could explain specific things with games. As an example, dying light. You could use the mutations of the zombies, to explain the mutation of viruses and the different effects on the human body. Or you could go with specific sacrifice moments and elaborate why people did what they did.
