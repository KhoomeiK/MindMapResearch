AskReddit,fpiomk1,t1_fpimbhp,1588645306.0,"Actually originally I had the bodies like dissolve and transfer the conscience memories and emotions and experiences to the living version, so they could better adapt to the new dimension. In the story this is used as commentary on how the brain copes with trauma. Because the version of herself she has to kill in the new dimension she first travels too has been abused so terribly her brain has blocked it all out and basically tricks itself into thinking everything is normal and fine. So now she has to try and figure out what all these fucked up memories are as she navigates this new world and tries to overcome detaching from reality they way this second personality wants to.

then in the sequel, they hop between dimensions killing themselves trying to find a hospitable place to live. All the while absorbing all these versions of themselves and trying to cope with multiple lifetimes of experience, including trauma, lovers, relationships, crazy experiences, nostalgia for things they've never actually experienced. 

Even thought about adding a little twist in where they linger in a dimension because she finds out that her brothet isn't related to her in a new dimension and they're actually lovers and she's torn between killer her new dimension lover or her old dimension brother, cause she can't have both, and the longer she puts it off the sicker/weaker/crazier they both go, because 2 of the same in one dimension.

 She kills her ""other"" self, and trys to integrate into the new world only to find out that everything is a huge facade, 90 percent of the people are abusive psycos and everything is controlled by really strict unspoken social norms. The only person who knows she's from another dimension is her ""brother"". She decides she's gotta break them out of the universe, but has no way to get back to her original universe. She goes snooping around the vaults of the local church and finds a monk who is one of the few sain people who knows how she can get out of their current dimension. 100s or thousands of years ago the monks would travel between dimensions, not using technology, but ancient holy relics. He gives her one of these relics and she uses it to travel with her ""brother"" to a different dimension. They wake up in a cave in a totally different time period, think pre-roman invasion Britannia. If they're gonna survive they have to find their other selves and kill them.
