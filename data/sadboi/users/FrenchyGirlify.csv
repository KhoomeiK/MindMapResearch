bipolar,fgs70ui,t3_f049t7,1581074629.0,"Yessss, before I met my fiance. I ""fell in love"" alot. Be obsessed with them to the point that everything else didn't matter. It wasn't always romantic, but it felt all consuming. Until it was over & I wasn't spending time with them. Then learned I was just being obsessive. I had to learn to mentally take a step back & evaluatey feelings about someone. My therapist told me something, imagine your life as a wheel & things that you cared about: work, romantic partner, friends, family, working out, downtime ect. Whatever it on your wheel & if one is more then the other then you can feel out of balance & can feel out of balance. So I try to apply that to my life. Try to not to be or do any one thing too much."
bipolar,fgs6jsu,t3_f052fn,1581074008.0,"Yes, I do that all the time. I'll be doing something zone out & make up stories in my head, sing or like have this ""vision"" of me doing something. Lol. It's one of the reasons I started writing. So it would get out of head & try to make sense of it."
