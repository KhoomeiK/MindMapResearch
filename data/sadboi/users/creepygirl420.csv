offmychest,fr00f7w,t3_glqqfu,1589780155.0,"  I’m so sorry. I’ve lost people I loved before. The pain is always a part of you as I’m sure you learned from losing your parents. The need to mourn her loss isn’t going to ever completely die out. 

  You probably feel disassociated right now, traumatized, heartbroken, I can only imagine. Please just take care of yourself as much as possible. Do you have anyone who can look after you? 

  I don’t want to give too much advice because being in this situation I know that nothing makes the pain go away when you’ve just lost someone. I just want you to know that you’re cared about.

  And it’s not your fault. Everything you’re feeling is valid, but I promise that this is a very natural reaction to losing a loved one to suicide. I know you may not be convinced by a stranger’s words. But it’s not your fault. It really isn’t. You love your sister. You didn’t deserve this. And I’m sorry."
TalesFromYourServer,fqzzssb,t1_fqyo38r,1589779658.0,I feel angry for you. Idk about you but I can get in a lot of trouble if I take off my mask. The level of delusion to think this is okay to grab at someone’s face during a pandemic blows my mind.

I get chronic cramps everywhere in my body including my left arm... which makes me worry I’m having a heart attack every time! The anxiety is from the alcohol but having my suspicion confirmed that the cramp is from the alcohol as well is so comforting. It never happened before but alcoholism makes me lose my doubt it everything. I’m just stacking up reasons that sobriety is the key to success and you’ve helped me make that even stronger!
stopdrinking,fqwc9zu,t1_fqwb29h,1589699381.0,"I relate to those regretful things you did. The things I’m willing to admit were a little embarrassing, the things I refuse to share were so embarrassing I’m a bit traumatized to this day. 

Ive also had sex drunk and found out the next day... I don’t know your experience but for me it’s fucked up my relationship with my best friend. We recently got sexual but I have no memory of it. I feel really violated but I don’t know if it was my fault. I just can’t speak to him anymore because I feel so fucking weird. 

I just assume as well. And live in shame. Sobriety is the only escape.

  You are right. There is no functional. Alcoholism is gambling with your own consciousness. 

  It sounds like you have been through this before. It sucks starting over with your sobriety. One day you have 30 days, 3 months, the next you’re back to square 1. 

  Except you’re not. You already said you know what to do, because you have experience under your belt. Sometimes our old demons bite us in the ass because we still have healing to do. 

  At least that’s how I feel. I have no idea if you relate. But thank you for your comment because it made me think and I appreciate that. I wish you well on your journey."
stopdrinking,fqwbd1q,t1_fqwauj6,1589698508.0,My heart goes out to the person you were in the past who was so vulnerable. I’m so glad you made it. 48 days?!? That’s fucking awesome. I know sobriety doesn’t immediately fix all of your problems but hey. I’m proud of you.
stopdrinking,fqwb6ro,t3_gl8zal,1589698344.0,"  Some people gotta hit rock bottom before they get sober because they can make excuses up until that point. This can be your rock bottom, remember the panic you felt. If you keep going down this route it’s a matter of time. 

  But it sounds like you might not be sober yet and I care about you. I really don’t want you to drink but if you do... try to find a way to stop yourself from driving. Is there someone you can give your car keys to? Is there a way you can keep food ready for yourself before you become intoxicated so you don’t end up getting in the car? Please think about this if you decide to drink. 

And I don’t want anyone to think I’m supporting continuing this habit but I think if there’s anything you can do to avoid driving drunk it should be done. I care about you OP."
stopdrinking,fqwashz,t3_gl9ua5,1589697979.0,"That sounds really nice. It’s something those who have suffered from alcoholism can just appreciate in a totally unique way. Doing “normal” things feels so good doesn’t it?! Good luck to you, and amazing progress."
stopdrinking,fqwaouz,t3_gl9vdk,1589697887.0,That’s so encouraging. I’m a hypochondriac with an alcohol problem and the random pains drive me fucking crazy. Like you said it’s so random. I get weird cramps in parts of my body that I never have had before and I wonder if it’s a symptom of something horrible. Which it is in a way but... I’m trying to get sober right now and hearing stuff like this just makes me feel supported as fuck.
stopdrinking,fqw9jyb,t1_fqw9av9,1589696841.0,"Oh my jesus christ. That is crazy to me because for one you were somehow coherent enough to type but incoherent enough to... do that. I wake up with gigantic bruises all the time, people always ask me about them and I make up stories. Nothing like that although I did bust my head open once and need stitches the next morning. I’m glad you’re doing better now."
stopdrinking,fqw9dc0,t1_fqw7wzk,1589696675.0,"Wow I feel the same about that being a reason to brush it off. Especially because I’m functional, it’s not an emergency necessarily but fuck I’ve been telling myself I was gonna get sober for a while now... almost 2 years... And i keep thinking “if only i had done it a year ago i’d be fine now.” Like you said it’s not benign but we trick ourselves into giving in to it anyway. 
  
I recommend the book “The Naked Mind” by Annie Grace. She actually says in the beginning that you don’t need to stop drinking as you read the book, to just read and continue with your daily routine as usual. It really helped me once when I went to detox. I think it’s helpful because it alleviates a bit of the pressure around first getting sober."
stopdrinking,fqw8ver,t1_fqw8awc,1589696241.0,"Agreed for sure about professional help. In my opinion, alcoholism can be a symptom of something else like mental illness or trauma. They sort of just aggravate one another in my opinion, like the alcoholism makes my mental illness worse but when I drink it’s often due to the mental illness. The point is that sobriety isn’t a cure all. Getting sober is really great and a huge step, it has to be done if you wanna see progress. But honestly everyone on this sub should probably see a therapist if they haven’t already, to put it in the most simplest terms possible."
stopdrinking,fqw7vek,t3_gla85c,1589695387.0,"I think everybody is different to be honest. For some people their problems mostly stem from drinking and for others it’s a mask, for many it’s both. But I think you’re coming from a valid place, it’s not like you get sober and boom you’re perfect. Recovery is lifelong."
stopdrinking,fqw7oug,t3_gla5ek,1589695235.0,"I feel the same. If you ever want to vent to someone I’m here. I don’t really feel comfortable speaking about this with friends or family so the internet has been my safe space to build up the courage I need to cure myself from this awful disease. I can’t give much advice but these subreddits to help, I don’t wanna share stories because since I’m not fully sober yet I feel it may not help you, but people on here care, and you can find so many who will relate. Even if you don’t get sober tomorrow, don’t stop coming here. It doesn’t always happen overnight."
stopdrinking,fqw4xpn,t1_fqvzxrr,1589692969.0,"  Thank you. That honestly helps me because I don’t know a lot of people who have had success this way, I’ve had so many appointments over the years but never really to treat this specific problem. I know I can find someone to help but I need to be honest. It’s just hard because I’m so used to lying about this. It’s the one thing I try to keep secret from everyone I know. 
  
  I feel frustrated still because I’m an essential worker and I have been working crazy shifts all the time. So I feel tired and hungover always. But I can’t sleep without the alcohol so... I don’t know which is better. To wait this out and continue to do something that causes me misery, or decide the insomnia is worth it and attempt to work when I haven’t slept in who knows how long... I feel trapped. Sorry that this might not be the most positive answer in the world. Your comment actually gives me a lot to think about so thank you."
stopdrinking,fqthnm0,t1_fqsq3xm,1589639188.0,"I’m scared to tell my doctor about what’s going on tbh. In the past when I was treated like a drug addict, it was very difficult to get the medication I need to sleep because my doctors assumed I would abuse it, which I understand but truly even when I’m sober I need some strong anti anxiety meds to sleep. I’ve never abused my meds but I don’t think anyone will trust me if I tell them I’m an alcoholic."

survivinginfidelity,foe2al6,t3_g6wc66,1587694630.0,"Honestly I empathize with her. But NO you should not give her another chance. 

I empathize because obviously she knows she’s really fucked up. There no way she can justify this divorce to herself, she can’t think “Oh well it’s OP’s fault for blah blah blah.” Nah it’s on her 100% and she knows it.

However the fact that A) She still has the job working with this guy and B) She hasn’t even gone to therapy yet, both make me think she’s trying to convince herself that she’s changed when really she just regrets her choices. 

Another problem is that people cannot just change themselves to save a relationship. Inner change takes time and it happens because *you* want to give it to yourself for *your* wellbeing. Her motivation is simply to please you. These “changes” never last. 

If you really really really wanna give her another chance, which I don’t think you really should but if you do. Give it time. Y’all need to grow on your own, she should still do the therapy thing. And so should you! 

If y’all are meant to be together you will still want to be together after taking a few years to grow on your own. Ok I’m done that’s my piece!"

Coronavirus,flo10vx,t1_flmqgoc,1585329638.0,"If you are immune, does that mean you’re asymptomatic and can still spread the disease if you catch it, or does it mean that you can’t carry the virus at all?"
Coronavirus,flmnytr,t1_flmjreq,1585289788.0,Holy shit.
TrollMUA,flifvc7,t3_fovufp,1585181645.0,I love it!
askwomenadvice,flifk75,t1_flhelmh,1585181453.0,Yes!!! If they miss you they will contact you. OP you might want closure but it’s best to just accept that you already reached out to them both and they both left you hanging. The “why” isn’t really that important. If/when they get over it and want to talk then you will know.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fliep40,t1_flh77j1,1585180948.0,"Yesss absolutely. I’m a DDD and underwire is a must, but padding just makes my boobs look comically large. Plus it is SO uncomfortable and I feel like my boobs feel like nerf balls. Unlined bras are awesome!"

houston,fldibm7,t1_fldhclx,1585065104.0,You can do that. You can even go for walks around  the neighborhood they just don’t want public gatherings.
cringe,flckibh,t3_fnvtyg,1585034492.0,It’s beyond cringe but honestly you can see the effort he put into it! Teenagers go through some cringey phases I feel bad that this got posted online.
todayilearned,fl8tqq8,t1_fl8jm94,1584932085.0,I guess they were friends but jesus christ anyone asking you to hide something for them while the police search their house would be an automatic no from me. If it really just was sex toys I would check to make sure they’re not lying... Maybe I read too much weird shit on reddit but that sounds pretty suspicious.
relationship_advice,fl7cly1,t3_fmxxnc,1584898979.0,Honestly it sounds like he doesn’t care about you. If I’m sharing a space with someone I care about I at least do the bare minimum of making sure things don’t get too messy. Does he really not care about your comfort or your opinion of him? If he can’t understand something this simple on his own then I think you can do better.
