narcissism,eru9w3j,t3_c3wuyi,1561268806.0,"I honestly think you're the narcissist  here, dude. Your post history is full of Red Pill garbage. Why don't you try to understand where your wife is coming from? She just had a baby. Her sleep is garbage and her hormones are all over the place. Is she supposed to be grateful you hold your child for an hour a day? Take care of the kid and let her shower and take a nap. Television was the only thing that kept me sane as a new mom and you just broke all the remotes. Which means once she finally gets the baby to sleep she can't even watch TV. Your wife just went through the hardest thing a woman's body goes through and it affects everything.  Grow up and support your wife. Stop trying to be so controlling. Go to therapy and work on your issues. Be a father. She is frustrated and for good reason. If my partner decided he was a hero for holding our child for an hour a day, I'd tell him to hit the road."
