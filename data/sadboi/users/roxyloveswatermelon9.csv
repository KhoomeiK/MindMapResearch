Nootropics,f3k4mdc,t1_f3k3tsj,1570961878.0,I had it on an empty stomach with black coffee - do you think this could have caused the lack of effect?
Nootropics,f3k4c5l,t1_f3k3spg,1570961762.0,I had it on an empty stomach with black coffee at about 11am
Nootropics,f3jgt3x,t1_f3jggph,1570952482.0,"Wasn’t on any other substances at the time. 

I drink coffee most days but I’ve never noticed any kind of buzz from it and never have any problem sleeping if I have it in the evening. 

I was also reasonably well rested when I took it."
Anxiety,f3az15b,t3_dgedyv,1570796849.0,Exact same thing happens to me
ADHD,f3682cu,t3_dfw5ln,1570708090.0,Everything you just described sounds so familiar to me. I feel exactly the same way and can confirm it’s pretty shit
Anxiety,f332ksw,t1_f331yin,1570630604.0,"Social anxiety has actually been in the back of my mind.

I get very stressed in classes which are interactive where I might be called on for example. I know everyone gets worried about this stuff sometimes, but I get extremely worried about it to the point that I won’t want to attend / actually won’t attend the class. 

I’m also always very very conscious of how I might be coming across to people and hyper aware of what people think of me."
ADHD,f32wmrf,t1_f32w1u9,1570627610.0,"Thank you for this. 

I’m a perfectionist and I really care about what people think of me / my work, which makes the chronic procrastination extremely frustrating."
ADHD,f32uwzr,t3_dfghsq,1570626629.0,"Also waiting to see a psych about very similar symptoms. 

What stood out to me in your post was that feeling of just not being able to start on a project for some reason. I really need to start a difficult assignment ASAP, but I just cannot bring myself to work on it no matter how dire the situation becomes - which makes me really anxious. This has been a common theme in my life. 

I’m also worried that I’m being dramatic and maybe I’m just lazy. I know everyone probably experiences this kind of stuff (to a degree) occasionally.

But I really feel have a strong feeling that something isn’t right with me..."
Anxiety,f32s8gi,t1_f32rye9,1570624345.0,"You’re under no obligation to stay at all, you’re an adult and you’re allowed to leave at any time for any reason. Good luck :)"
Anxiety,f32r0xh,t1_f32qrvv,1570623190.0,"I also get extremely stressed when arriving late/ leaving class early. But it’s an irrational fear, no one cares or is judging at all. If you’re almost done anyway, stay. Otherwise just say you have work / a drs appointment and get outta there. Can’t be as bad as sitting in a lab holding back tears."
Anxiety,f32q5jw,t3_dffxru,1570622293.0,"In the state that you’re in right now, I would recommend just leaving class. This lab really isn’t that important in the grand scheme of things. Right now just leave your class and focus on looking after yourself and not being too hard on yourself. 

You can figure out what you’re going to do about all your coursework later. And definitely look at seeing someone about the anxiety."
ADHD,f32oyx0,t1_f32ohoc,1570621015.0,"Thanks for your reply. Have you found any relief now having being diagnosed? 

I tried some of a friend's ADHD drugs (bad I know) but didn’t notice any difference at all."
