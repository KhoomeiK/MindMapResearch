I still think wrapping a tampon in tissue and throwing it away (which I will do if septic systems) is less gross than removing and cleaning a cup personally. Throwing away a tampon only takes a moment of being near blood, whereas cups seem to be all about embracing your blood. Tampons are quick and easy and can be replaced anywhere, Altho what are you suppose to do if you need to change your cup and you aren’t at home? Wrap it in toilet paper and hold onto it for who knows how long? Also I’ve read about ppl sneezing with cups in and blood exploding all over them and up their shirts??

The audience gets to sit on their high horse acting like they give a shit, when they’re just in it for “the crazy psychodrama”. At the end of the day they pat themselves on the back for pretending to give af and make millions off of the expenses of others.

Also the idea of having to stick your hand inside yourself and fish around for a cup when it’s full seems grosser to me than just pulling a string and flushing a tampon, bc I feel you are at a higher risk of getting blood on your hand removing a cup. Also I get dizzy/blackout when I see a lot of blood so the idea of seeing a cup full of my blood freaks me out, and the last thing I want is someone to find me passed out half naked in a bathroom with a cup full of my own menstrual blood spilled everywhere.
Edit: I think used pads and tampons are gross too, but these were my only options during my first blood and they’re all I’ve ever known"

It’s honestly embarrassing to admit, as typically media portrays this as an issue for young teenagers but I was in my early 20s. I was already bulimic when I discovered the site, but it drove me into a much darker place where I began starving myself, over exercising, self harming and truly became suicidal for the first time in my life. I was living on my own and would spend days without seeing anyone, just locked in my room on this site feeling misunderstood and alone. After years of active effort I consider myself in recovery now, no longer visit the site despite my occasional urges for complete self destruction. No longer eating disordered or self harming. It’s been a hard journey, but the saddest part is that I can only imagine how many hundreds of thousands of others have gone through the exact same struggles due to unhealthy online forums."

I do feel like the child’s wants come before my wants. For example, I expressed that I want kids of my own but my bf said one reason he doesn’t want more kids is bc his son has always been an only child and is used to being the center of attention, that we’d have to wait until his kid was older and out of the house. Also I have no desire to move closer to where the BM is bc I hate the location there, and I tried asking about moving to the halfway point essentially and my bf refused, said there was no point and we may as well stay where we are. His life plan is that I fit into his idea of moving next to BM and me watch over his kid until “we get adjusted” however long that takes, and then when his kid isn’t a minor he’ll quit his job and travel and I can join. Honestly that doesn’t fit my plan at all, I’d rather travel now and then settle down and have a family of my own. He contradicts himself going back and forth about not wanting more kids to being willing to have more bc I want them, but then says how he plans on quitting his job in ten years and doing what he wants bc he’s sick of playing dad (he had his kid at 17yo). It leaves me with lots of red flags and questions and I thought I was just being selfish and not understanding bc I don’t have a kid and he always reminds me how I’ll never understand bc I’m childfree, which I agree, but I was hoping posting here would shed light on whether I’m overthinking his dad obligations or whether he’s being selfish"

Some think that’s extra but I’m very family oriented. At first he seemed totally down and said how he would want more some day and was down for adopting. Then later on when we got more serious he said how he doesn’t want any more children at all bc he’s been a dad since 17yo, but that he’d be willing to have one more for my sake (another huge red flag). I took time to think it over and told him how that was a deal breaker for me, but then he said how he was warming up to the idea of more kids. But then at other times he’s said how he’s essentially ready for his kid to turn 18 so he doesn’t have to take care of a kid anymore (another huge red flag) so he can do whatever he wants. I do feel like this is all very serious very soon but he put the blame on me saying I talked so much about wanting to meet his kid (which I guess I did to an extent but only bc he would literally invite me over and have his kid hide in his room while I was over and it all just felt very weird and ultimately he was the one to initiate us meeting each other, but I would have been fine with waiting longer). Whenever we try talking about our expectations it feels more like he expresses his and I can either follow suit or get out. Like he said he doesn’t want me to have a job at first but then if I don’t get a job after some indefinite amount of time he’d be resentful of me. He’s very contradictory.

We started spending A LOT of time together very quickly and after a few weeks I confronted him asking if he had a child bc I saw pics of a young boy on his social media. Turns out he has a 12yo boy and “just wanted me to give him a chance”. I purposefully don’t date single dads but didn’t want to give something up just bc a kid was involved. He downplayed it like it wouldn’t be that big of a deal. We’ve been together a few months now and I’ve learned it’s much more serious than he let on obviously. He is determined to move three hours away to be closer to the biological mother for his kids sake, and expects me to move with him without really asking if I wanted to (he brought it up to his kid with me in the car he said “how would you feel about us moving to ___” and his kid said he’d like that.) he tells me all the time how much his kid likes me and how he doesn’t know if he’d be able to make the move work without me, and when I got a job interview he verbalized that’s he hoped I didn’t get the job so id have more time to watch after his kid while he worked. I love them both but I’m not a priority to my bf like I feel like I should be, and when I tried talking to my bf his actions/words he basically told me it will always be this way.

It was so gross and obviously we didn’t eat the food.

The tour should only take an hour right?... Four hours later (it’s july) we get back to the vehicle and almost barf when we open the doors.

Second session, she gets a phone call as soon as we sat down together, left the room for ten minutes, and came back in saying someone in crisis needed her more. (Little did she care that I was suicidal myself and having my own crisis). I was asked to leave and reschedule, which I did for the earliest opening being 3 weeks out.

My older brother was an addict and molested me throughout middle/high school and only stopped when I left home for college, but he continued my first visit back after freshmen year. I threatened to tell our parents and that’s the only reason he stopped then. Being an addict, he had harmed my entire family in a lot of different ways (stole from us, lied to us, held a knife to us, broke things, yelled the most hateful insults to my parents, and very much more). I hated him so much and hated that my parents would do anything for him, they really love him and he’s only ever lived with my parents even tho he’s 27 now. After I graduated college and my brother was sober at the time, I finally told my parents what happened bc I was living at home again and it was having all kinds of awful side effects on me. They essentially didn’t do anything but apologize on his behalf. I expected them to hate him after I told them, but they didn’t. They were disgusted by his actions but my mom tried to make excuses for him and blame me. My brother kept living with my parents, and eventually I went to grad school to get away again. Now I’m out of grad school and home again, my brother still lives here and is using again, and my parents still love him just as much as they always have. I love him too, but I also hate him. His birthday is this week and my mom and I are making him a cake tomorrow (I wish I was kidding).

TLDR: don’t assume that revealing the molestation will make your mother hate your cousin. I’m not saying not to tell her, bc telling my parents was very cathartic for me. But It’s possible that telling your mom still won’t change anything about how she feels towards your cousin. And that can be even more anger-inducing, so be prepared for that possibility"

Out of all the good (and bad) in my life, this was by far the experience I’m most thankful for. I wish there were more programs like it around. I recently had a job interview for a college wellness program position and wasn’t hired bc I “focused too much on mental health”. Society can be really discouraging sometimes, but it can also be a reminder of all the opportunity just waiting to be seized. Call me cliche but I dream of future generations who will look back at us and those before us and think about how far we/they have come"
AmeriCorps,fopm45r,t1_fnmdk3v,1587965206.0,"I very highly doubt they would flat out ask your references if you are a drug user or ever have been one. Typically when contacting references they ask about when/how you worked with them and whether the experience was a positive one or not (ie would they recommend you for service). If your reference implies that there were some issues/negative experiences, then they may ask the reference to elaborate. If you can’t trust your reference to say only/mostly positive things about you, then you shouldn’t list them."
AmeriCorps,fopl1hj,t3_g7ohzv,1587964346.0,"I’m (26F) currently preparing my VISTA application, as it seems like a great foot in the door. I interned with a nonprofit for one summer and they hosted a VISTA (~30F). While working with her and other VISTAs/host sites, I only ever heard positive remarks and was encouraged by all of them to apply myself. However I have yet to hear first-hand about life after VISTA, Altho a VISTA site coordinator praised it to me as a good way to get into the nonprofit field.
Based on my experience job searching, Generally nonprofit positions pay lower than LLC or corporate positions, ranging from $20k-$35k for full time entry-level positions. But after gaining several years of experience (~5yrs) then positions may range from $30k-$50k. At the top of your game after a decade or two of experience, you may be able to get $60k-$80k for top level positions. 
(If others have seen differently, pls say so bc I’m approximating here)"
AlAnon,foopog8,t1_foh7gqr,1587943832.0,"Maybe try standing up to your brother and/or mom that there is only so much you can do? You have to take care of yourself, and your brother needs to learn how to rely on himself. It doesn’t matter how many programs he goes in or times he gets arrested, he will only stop using if he chooses to. I’m 24F and my brother (27M) has been an addict for years, still only ever lived with my parents. They’ve covered shit up to keep him from getting arrested on multiple occasions, but instead of him being thankful it just makes him feel more entitled. He’ll become delusional as well, and while he does have underlying mental illness that doesn’t justify his use and actions. My mom has made it clear I’m expected to take care of him after they’re gone, and honestly I’m terrified of winding up in the situation you are currently in. There is no right answer and while I’m sure you want to help your brother, sometimes the best way to help is to put your foot down and set boundaries."

My bf has joint custody of his son (12yo) and we plan on moving in together to a new city close to where the BM lives so both parents can have an active role in the son’s life. Despite having a support system with the BM being remarried and me willing to help take care of his kid, my bf is completely stressed and worried that his son doesn’t have what it takes to survive (ie get on the bus after school or complete his hw), to the point where my bf is afraid he’ll lose his job bc his son may miss the bus and need a ride home one day. 
My bf says he doesn’t believe in punishment, he prefers positive reinforcement *eyeroll* but finally I told my bf that if his son misses the bus and has to wait an hour or two for one of us to get off work and be able to pick him up, then that’s a lesson learned!! He probably won’t miss the bus again after that.. I’m all for helping out and of course I would pick the son up if I’m able, but this boy is almost a teenager and gets babied so much! We are literally moving bc the boy misses his mom (understandable) and I love my bf and his son, but this kid really needs some discipline and to learn how to be more self reliant. He doesn’t even know how to wash dishes!"

therapy,foehmkq,t3_g6qlhm,1587704002.0,"I worked at an on campus gym for 1.5 years and me along with other female coworkers were having a similar issue with one autistic boy. He started off harassing my roommate (who also worked there) to the point where our bosses intervened and had a meeting with him. He behaved better for a while after that but eventually he turned his attention towards me. I ended up dreading work for fear of seeing him and me wanting not to be rude but also feeling extremely uncomfortable with his words and actions. I never confronted him about it and eventually I graduated, forgetting all about it until reading this. I know he harassed more coworkers as well but I don’t know if anyone besides my roommate ever reported him. He didn’t seem malicious and I still believe he actually had autism, but reading your experience makes me wonder if he truly realized what he was doing and if he used his condition to his advantage"
