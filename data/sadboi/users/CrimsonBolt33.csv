When I was on the phone with the police a guy stepped through the broken door and started asking for service. I explained we couldn't help him right at that moment cause we just got robbed and he started yelling at us and being all pissy cause he thought we should be helping him right away.

&#x200B;

They are stupid because they do this in China and assume the rest of the world does the same...the problem is that outside of China the press is generally free or at least much less restricted. They can't understand this concept."

&#x200B;

While computer networking can get complicated the CCNA is the ENTRY level certificate.

&#x200B;

Also you want to quit cause you lost interest? Welcome to life...suck it the fuck up and stick with it. Not everything is a dopamine high and getting places in life takes effort, practice, and grit. If you just stick with things til you lose interest you will get nowhere in life.

&#x200B;

Passion...the thing that truly keeps you going is developed over time through becoming an expert at something. You have hit the stage where learning lost its fire (honeymoon stage)... The Dunning-Kruger effect. Everything you do in life will have this same exact wall of losing interest."

Entrepreneur,fox9fkz,t1_fox8gtd,1588137458.0,"I was on my mobile on the subway so my post was pretty brief but you are right. You have to expand, evaluate, and cut off the things that aren't working and expand the things that are working. This is why, as you point out, the larger you get as a business the more management staff you need to manage each area of the business for the exact reasons you posted.

The only reason huge companies usually stop expanding or trying new things is because they corner a market or capture a large enough share of a market and get comfortable so they don't grow beyond that which is fine. It just tends to bite them in the ass when their market gets shaken up by a newcomer or strong market force that makes their product sell horribly."
Ghosts,fox85qa,t3_g9va2g,1588136481.0,"I was recently watching a video from ""Ghosts of Caramel Maine"" and he made a really good observation on that point. He had taken videos and tried to speak to an entity he dubs ""Shadow Dude"" and for the longest time he never heard anything (but saw lots).

&#x200B;

Eventually a friend helped him with proper audio equipment and how to search for EVPs and he went back to his old videos and the Shadow Dude WAS talking to him.

I think what they do in their state seems like complete actions but what we see is a tiny fraction of what they are actually trying to do. Just because we don't understand doesn't mean it's useless"

Entrepreneur,fox4xgw,t3_g9g7ic,1588134162.0,"Expansion is what most people think of when they think of growth (we make and sell 1000 screwdrivers a year! If we double it we will make more money!). What most people don't capitalize on is pivoting and adding new services and products.

Every business needs a core product or service but I bet you can't find any successful businesses larger than a mom and pop store that doesn't have a large array of products and services.

So to answer your question directly, don't wait for anything to expand. Always be evaluating the health of your current offerings and looking for new opportunities. Just keep your cash flow positive and try new things until you find your core product or service"
totalwar,fots6ct,t1_fotrqxm,1588064213.0,Don't think that really applies...I already have the game and can't get it a second time...a choosy beggar would be someone who is asking for something and rejects the offerings

coolguides,foqhutp,t1_fopjble,1587993917.0,"The lack of apology is less a matter or logic (""they lost and Axis powers are bad so an apology is needed"") and more a matter of ""face""...the humiliation of defeat is terrible to them and the idea of an apology is so humiliating they can't do it. Asian cultures that have the whole ""face"" system are strangely narcissistic they preach taking care of others but stress the importance of making sure you don't look bad in any way (and those things contradict heavily)...

&#x200B;

perfect example...they can lose...but get fucked if you think they will apologize (to help the damaged parties heal) because that means they admit they did wrong."
