shittydarksouls,fqp5kiy,t1_fqoh71p,1589535815.0,"That's a real long stretch, mate. [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) tells us that the simpler theory is more realistic.

Gwyn was scared of the Dark, because the age of Dark means the end of the age of gods. Gwyn just wanted to protect his own, without truly understanding the consequences of interfering with the natural cycle of Fire and Dark. Bonfires in Lordran are all extensions of the First Flame. They are kindled with souls and humanity (i.e. dark souls), so it stands to reason that the First Flame is the same. 

It is far more likely that Nito was the one who created the curse of the undead, since death is his domain whereas Gwyn's is of light and the sun. Knowing this, we can infer that Nito both created the curse and spread the legends of the ""fate of the undead"" in order to lure humans, who inherently possess fragments of the dark soul, to Lordran in order to kindle the Flame.

You assume malice, but honestly in my opinion? It's only natural that one would seek to protect their own. If humankind was faced with imminent extinction, humans would fight to protect themselves, no? Likewise if godkind was threatened the same way, it is only natural that they would seek to defend their existence, even if it means making a number of sacrifices."
