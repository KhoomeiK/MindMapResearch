Viki1999,fr1cn3u,t1_fr166c8,1589817376.0,"if you ignore the mining you also have to ignore that within the current power costs, which makes it extremely small.

a single btc transaction takes around 600 bytes of data, your video takes around 93MB to download, so there'd fit 160k bitcoin transactions in the same amount of data as my view.

I really don't think the bandwidth usage will ever even come close to comparing to the electricity usage of mining

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rvus1/-/e0un1km reading this it seems like bitcoin uses general nodes, so not everyone needs to download every single transaction. I also don't really see why you think they won't do mining anymore, sure it won't be nearly as profitable but how else will the transactions be processed?"
Viki1999,fr1386l,t1_fr10hhx,1589812388.0,"I don't think the sending of the transactions is the power hog in bitcoin, it's the mining that's done by thousands of computers that really costs power, so if more people used bitcoin but mining didn't increase there wouldn't really be an increase in power usage. I think the issue lies in that increasing the worth of the coin would also increase the amount being mined. Mining would be much more worth it compared to electricity costs and so more people would start mining. 

It also increases the profitability of making cheaper, more energy efficient mining equipment though, to blanket say btc could never work because it's currently quite inefficient is in my mind comparable to say, saying a car could never be mainstream in the late 19th century because the cost of producing the fuel was way too high."
Viki1999,fr0zztn,t1_fr0uxml,1589810525.0,"according to some quick googling (may be wrong, here's a source http://climatestate.com/2018/01/15/energy-consumption-bitcoin-vs-banking-system/)

the current global banking infrastructure uses around 100 terrawatts annually where crypto uses around 30, now I have no clue how scalable bitcoin is compared to its energy usage, nor do I know how much of the banking infrastructure power cost will be reduced if its replaced by bitcoin.

I also think it's definitely possible that improvements in btc technology will significantly lower the carbon footprint.

That being said, I feel like your point made in the video still stands, the guy said btc would stop inflation and stop the need for a minimum wage. But a minimum wage would still be vital if capitalism is still around, if anything bitcoin would slowly suffer from deflation in value as more and more hard drives containing btc become inaccessible.

Capitalism isn't simply fixed by making government intervention impossible."
Viki1999,fr0uegx,t1_fr0efs4,1589806978.0,"The only reason the US dollar is stable is because of its widespread use, I think if a cryptocurrency was to become a mainstream form of currency it could be more stable.

just like the US dollar, a small amount of people control a very large amount of the wealth, the difference I think is that with bitcoin its very easy for those bitcoin whales to manipulate the prices.

Just keeping a currency stable does absolutely nothing to solve the fundamenyal issues that arise when a few people control a large proportion of that currency though."

**FAQ**

**What does this mean?**

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

**Why did you do this?**

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

• ⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, 

• ⁠Spreading incorrect information, 

• ⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

**Am I banned from the Reddit?**

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

**I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?**

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

**How can I prevent this from happening in the future?**

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. 

I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. 

Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."
