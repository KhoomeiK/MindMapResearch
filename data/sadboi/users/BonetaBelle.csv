GetMotivated,fr3sil2,t1_fr2d034,1589865067.0,"Depends what you like. I am not really a creative writer - I enjoy it but I never aspired to be an author. 

Academic writing is what I like, I wanted to create more change, and I was getting a bit bored, so I left marketing and just finished my law degree.

I don't find Bill Hicks's take offensive, but it is quite silly because obviously marketing is a skill set so it really depends on what you are marketing. For example, every single non-profit does a degree of marketing (you have to in order to get money) so it gave me opportunities to do a lot of cool volunteer work on the side for groups I really believe in. Not to mention there is a lot of creativity in marketing which many people with Arts backgrounds enjoy but I understand that people not in the field often don't realize that.

If you found a career that supports you and is super aspirational, that's awesome for you but I don't think there's anything wrong with a job that puts food on the table and volunteering for your passion on the side. What do you do?"

DSM-5 Criterion A for PTSD stipulates:

*The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or  threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, in  the following way(s):*

* *Direct exposure*
* *Witnessing the trauma*
* *Learning that a relative or close friend was exposed to a trauma*
* *Indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma, usually in the  course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, medics)*

So I really do not think sleep paralysis/nightmares qualify - although they can be subjectively scary, there was no actual or threatened serious injury etc. And of course it would not fall into any of the listed categories of ways you could be exposed to the trauma.

Also, I have had sleep paralysis a lot that involved violent hallucinations and it just wasn't even remotely as traumatizing as what gave me PTSD. I would take sleep paralysis a million times over that.

xxfitness,fp2e3lg,t1_fp267qc,1588260166.0,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with losing weight for aesthetic purposes, as long as you are doing so healthily, not over-restricting, and doing so because you want to, not because you feel like you ""have"" to in order to be attractive. You sound like you have a healthy approach and attitude, I think you will be fine. Just be aware of how you are feeling and make sure you are not falling into negative self-talk.

I have actually had a full-blown eating disorder and so much more goes into it than just ""you know, I think I would like to see how I look a bit leaner"". For me, it really didn't have anything to do with wanting to look attractive. So while you should be doing check-ins with yourself to make sure you are doing okay, wanting to lose a few pounds for aesthetic reasons is not going to make you become bulimic/anorexic like me. I don't at all agree that losing some weight for aesthetic purposes is automatically a slippery slope to developing a serious and life-threatening mental illness. 

Good luck! Half my family is Chinese so I definitely understand the pressure to eat a lot of homecooked food."

I wouldn't say I ever lost faith in love generally - I just thought I was inherently unlovable, which is part of why I got in the relationship in the first place. I definitely had a really complicated relationship with my mother - she was really emotionally abusive, occasionally physically abusive.

Told me I was a disappointment a lot, called me derogatory names, ungrateful, lazy, almost never said anything positive about me even though I can see now I was objectively a pretty good kid with great work ethic and grades. She would speak positively of some of my friends though - about how pretty some of them were (she never called me that, thought it would make me focus too much on my looks) or smart. She always thought I should be trying harder and I did not get an amazing result in absolutely everything I did, the only possibility was that it was my fault.

She also had no ability to regulate her emotions (anger was 0-100), saw crying or showing vulnerability (even among family) as weakness to be punished. And she was notoriously SUPER jealous, whether it be about my father or even me looking to other women as role models.

She came from a culture that puts a ton of value on conventional success, had a really really fucked up childhood and never had a good support system in her entire life, so I don't blame her at all. She definitely had serious mental health issues and needed therapy. I came to peace with everything a long time ago.

But I went into my first relationship thinking it was totally normal for people who loved each other to lash out and try to hurt each other, for any negative emotion (insecurity, doubt) to come out as anger, for fights to escalate until you were yelling and pushing each other in the street. My ex got increasingly jealous and controlling but that was normal to me. And to be fair to him, since I had associated love with obligation and pain due to my childhood, I was REALLY commitmentphobic at the beginning and only got into the relationship because he ultimately gave me an ultimatum after like 8 months of me refusing to commit. And I had no conflict resolution skills and hated feeling vulnerable. So it was definitely partially my fault the relationship was never 100% healthy.

EDIT: Also figuring out how to deal with my mental illnesses has made me way less toxic. Biweekly therapy, journaling, eating super healthy, scheduling time talking to loved ones, being super super careful with my drinking, and working out 5+ times a week helps me keep it together."

>I don’t know why she wanted to say she couldn’t talk to me, then drops this huge bombshell early in the morning.

So I assume your jurisdiction is the same since this is quite common, but our law society expressly forbids us talking to the opposing party about anything substantive without their lawyer present, if they have retained counsel. If I was his lawyer, I would absolutely not be allowed to talk to you because I am his lawyer and my duty is to him - if I gave you legal advice, it could be very harmful to you because it would obviously be biased and it's a violation of our ethical duties to go behind another lawyer's back and talk to their client.

With your ex, aside from his warrants - if he takes the stand and lies, then is caught, he could be tried for perjury. So with that risk + the outstanding warrants, I really don't know what your husband could offer him to make that risk worthwhile for him. Plus, if he told the truth, it would obviously seriously undermine your ex's case. If he tells the truth to your ex's counsel (there was no affair) there would be no benefit in subpoenaing him. And subpoenaing someone from another state is quite the process that involves the court in both states - there is no way your ex's counsel is going to do that unless they're 110% sure your ex is going to testify that you had an affair. So I personally wouldn't really worry about that right now.

But instead of panicking, you really need to call your lawyer and tell them what's happening. They can give you real advice. Stop worrying about the legal ramifications until you have gotten legal advice and actually understand what the issues and risks are."
datingoverthirty,fov1b51,t1_fouli91,1588093772.0,"I personally wouldn't assume she's lying. In many jurisdictions, abusing your children's parent isn't enough to make you lose custody.  It is actually really, really difficult for someone to completely lose access to their kids in court in most places. And she can't really stop her ex from seeing the kids if they haven't gone through the custody battle yet. If she never reported the physical abuse to the cops when it happened (which is common) and the temporary restraining order is expired, then it makes sense that her ex is still heavily involved in her kids' lives.

However, she obviously has way too much to deal with to be in a relationship and maybe can't safely be in a relationship, so I would walk if I was you."

dogs,fouo24r,t3_g9oz1f,1588087525.0,"I'll be honest, I think it's pretty weird that he insists that the dog needs to be in the bedroom when you have sex, especially if the dog has intervened before. To be clear, I don't think he's being inappropriate but I think it's really inconsiderate and uncomfortable. I also wouldn't insist that my dog needs to sleep in the bed with my partner if it effected their ability to sleep, especially if the dog triggers their allergies.

I'd probably end it - he really needs to be with someone who also wants their whole life to be their dog. You're not stupid for wanting some boundaries. I think a lot of his behaviour is reasonable, just different from what you want, but a better partner would want you to be comfortable during sex and sleep."

In addition to what everyone else is saying, some people take blocking very personally. I never block people. The only ex I have blocked right now is someone who caused me a lot of physical and emotional harm. So he probably thought it was at the point of no return when you did that.

I think what you do next is up to you, but I have definitely been known to lash out at people and realize I was interpreting their actions in the most negative and frankly unrealistic way after the fact.

I always feel better after admitting I was wrong and apologizing, even if it's way after the fact. I feel better because I know some people are really anxious and I would never want them to feel like they did something to warrant my shitty behaviour. Also, I have always appreciated an apology from someone else because I take ghosting quite personally. That might just be me though."
