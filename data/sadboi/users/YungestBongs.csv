Which was a shit ton of money for me at 18, but it‚Äôs better than serving that 3 years in jail they were trying to hand me. Just make sure you actually follow through with probation, no drinking, no drugs, do everything to NOT break it. If this is one of your first charges, they should go ‚Äúsemi‚Äù easy on you. The only reason i was let off probation in 30 days was because i got my 42 hours done in those 30 days. It was recommended by my lawyer to do that, just to show them that i actually care. And luckily, it was all expunged off my record. I wish you the best of luck, i know exactly how you‚Äôre feeling. But the worst part is now over. You‚Äôve got this. Keep your head up."

I also had broken up with her alittle before quarantine, and that just made it much worse since i couldn‚Äôt even go enjoy the things i like doing alone. The best recommendation i can give is doing everything in your power to remove her from your life. IE: delete pictures, block on social media, delete number, etc. Work on old hobbies, or start new ones. I got back into painting models after we broke up, which i hadn‚Äôt done in years, and it really took my mind off of her. I broke up with her 3 months ago now, and i‚Äôve stayed true to all of my recommendations other than checking her tumblr here and there. But do NOT do this.

Why thank you!! We can talk about rape in all female prisons as well if you‚Äôd like. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd ever get the chance to ghost me sweetheart, you and your strawman arguments couldn‚Äôt keep up (;"

I mean i‚Äôve had my amount of crazy girlfriends in the past, but i don‚Äôt put their red flags on new relationships. I talk to people until those red flags are visible, why is it not the same?"
relationships,fo931f4,t1_fo92ltp,1587609405.0,"No, and i‚Äôm sorry you went through that. But i have had women try to tarnish my name based on me rejecting them. Different stories though-yours sounds genuinely scary physically. While mine is more, revenge? I‚Äôm not sure. You make very good points, it may just be my honest personality clashing with _____ differing ones?? 

But you shouldn‚Äôt paint every guy with that same brush. I mean, i don‚Äôt paint every girl with the same brush, so why do you? Often, i will continue talking to a girl until those red flags are visible. So, why do women put these red flags on every guy they see? 

PS:thanks for the actual intellectual thinking vs. randomly strewn out fears"

relationships,fo92lvv,t1_fo91p8d,1587609130.0,"Haha. You make me giggle reddit girl. I‚Äôm not ignoring-i‚Äôm simply trying to understand the perspective-since clearly-i don‚Äôt have the same one. Men are beaten, raped, murdered, every single day for rejecting someone maybe not a woman, but, ever heard of prison? Stop painting everything with such a broad brush. Just because there are instances of people being killed 500 feet from my home-doesn‚Äôt mean i‚Äôm going to live in constant fear of being shot. Just because you heard stories of girls being ‚Äúkilled‚Äù over rejection-doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be scared to reject a guy. I already know what you look like, so i won‚Äôt even comment on the guys that reject you."
