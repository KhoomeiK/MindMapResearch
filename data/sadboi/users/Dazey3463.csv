I worked for a grocery store chain that put so much pressure on their managers about paying overtime, that the managers would have the store bookkeeper (who also did payroll) add up every minute so they could dock any overtime. So if you punched in a minute late from each of your 2 breaks and lunch, but you were not relieved to leave until 10 mins after you were supposed to, that 3 minutes from your 1 minute late punches were docked from the 10 that you worked over. Our union contract stated that anything over 8 mins over was OT. I was the fill in bookkeeper so i did the bookkeepers job whenever they were not there. But i saved EVERY SINGLE mgr signed ok to change  anyones electronic time card. If the Labor board ever stepped in I would have proof that I wasnt the one making the decisions."
