It all felt backwards to me :( the ""twist"" with the montage of Geralt wasnt heartbreaking, but more frustrating because the things he did werent even bad. Or bad enough to discourage Ciri. They could even be called good and supportive but were apparently discouraging.

Not stealing horses does push you to Ciri death, but it shouldnt matter as much as it does. Stealing horses, imo, might make Ciri think less of you or that you have no moral compass so why does anything she do matter re: saving the world?

I might be thinking too into it...I have been stuck at home for a week lol."

Witcher3,flpm54d,t1_flngxfj,1585362836.0,"The logic of the things done to encourage Ciri and the things done to discourage. It feels more of ""cater to Ciri's emotions no matter how irrational"" than good vs bad parenting/guiding. Also actions having the same weight as words seems off to me.

Going with her to the Lodge meeting...we know they are dangerous. and having Ciri ask for guidance beforehand, I would feel like I abandoned her if I didn't go, but apparently that's bad.

Not wanting to steal horses for her friends you don't even know? Ok, apparently having your own moral compass is bad even if your adult daughter might throw a tantrum about it. What i we get caught, then what Ciri? Let your friends steal them on their own or go yourself, as a father figure it felt wrong.

Having a drink with Ciri instead of snowball fight? I thought I was supposed to treat her like an adult and she was tired of being treated like a child...apparently drinking is bad and snowball is better. Figured she would get upset if I treated her like she's a kid. It's not consistent.

Telling her she doesn't have to be 100% at everything to comfort her? Apparently that's bad too.

Tell her to calm down twice when she wants to throw a tantrum and potentially kill people (the villagers upset at the grave and the lab)? Bad parenting, apparently, even as Avallach has been doing the exact same thing and telling you she needs to control her emotions properly to use her power well. 

Put a necklace on her at the lab? Bad. 

I took her to the grave, ended up stealing the horses for her against my better judgement, let her decide if she wanted to see her father (we didn't) and I still got the bad ending because I said a couple random things that didn't even make sense to be bad enough to affect her since she is portrayed as a strong-willed character.

The actions of taking her to her father, not going to the grave, and NOT accompanying her to the Lodge make sense for the bad ending since it makes you look careless. The actions should have had more weight than be outweighed by 2 calm downs and 1 drink.

Does this make sense? No matter how I try to wrap my brain around it, Ciri's characterization doesn't fit with how she would have reacted to these things. It really disappointed me.

I prefer Ciri dying as canon, but I hate the justification of it solely falling on Geralt's behavior which isn't bad enough to make it so. It needed more polarization in the things you could have said, if that makes sense."

It brought me so much joy and then I realized I had accomplished nothing. Not even the joy of an ending that made sense.

I was supposed to just let her run with her emotions when that's exactly what Avallach was trying to train her not to do? That's not confidence boosting at all.

Was I supposed to abandon her when she low key asked for help when talking to the lodge? I took her to the grave, let her decide if she wanted to see her father, stole horses for her against my better judgement. Told her to stay calm because we dont want another crazy magic spira. I dont know what they were thinking when writing this...doing good deeds mean nothing if a few simple words can destroy a strong willed woman? Ugh.

she also asks us to write down on post-its what the ""muddiest point"" of the class was after each session so she can ""explain better next class""

I managed to persuade the customer service chat person on amazon to give me the name of the person who's account it was ordered on because ""I want to say thank you for the gift"" lol and I contacted them by googling their name and through linkedin in. Customer service policy is that they are not allowed to give you the name of the gifter but that was how I got it. A mistake on their part but a win for me to figure out this mystery.

The person emailed me back and said they had absolutely no idea and that their amazon account may have been hacked and they apologized profusely.

I think someone else mentioned that some companies (tho I'm not sure why mayo) might be ordering things to have the items move higher up on recommended lists on websites like amazon or even write fake reviews that match specific verified orders.

It may have been a glitch that produced that label at the warehouse or it may have been the weird scam review or ranking stuff."

I usually preface it with ""hi I don't think we've met I'm ____ what program are you in?""

I'm an introvert that needs to get adopted by an extrovert at social things and the only way to do this is to be where the extroverts are. I'm not a social organizer by nature and live at home with my parents so I can't really invite people to hang out at my place, so I'm trying to be more present at these things to get to know more people. 

Good luck. Feel free to reach out because it seems like a lot of people have this problem and the ones who don't are the most vocal and are seen as having a blast which can make the rest of us feel extra lonely like something is wrong, but it's not just you. 

I'm going to the department tailgate before the game tonight by myself and hope to see some familiar faces and re-introduce myself if they don't remember me. If your program has a facebook group that plans these things, message them and ask for the upcoming activity schedule and say that you're new. People are generally very welcoming."
offmychest,eyoq9b7,t1_eyopozx,1567281434.0,"True. I guess people might be different in the way they deal with it.

For me it was a part of my life I never wish to see again so I just cut it out and bury it instead of stitching it up."
depression,eynbogp,t1_eynbbia,1567240205.0,I'm starting therapy again soon. I'm hoping it helps because all I usually got were pamphlets about self care and meditation from other therapists.
socialskills,eyn8wky,t1_eyn4ubg,1567236850.0,Yeah I'm definitely an introvert. I like company in small doses as work and even my family is socializing to me.
NoStupidQuestions,eyn769n,t1_eyn6waj,1567234604.0,Hmmm I noticed it in Andrew Scott's accent in Fleabag. Maybe it's a different accent? Like it's almost like it's just an h sound not a sh.
depression,eyn1k05,t1_eymzjoq,1567227581.0,Thanks for your response. I have a party tomorrow at school and am going to try to be positive and social and hopefully not anxious.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,eym1uvv,t1_eylzypl,1567197399.0,Ooo my hormones have been weird lately!! I'll mention this at doctor appointment I already have. Maybe my stink might not only be because of the heat...
depression,eylo108,t1_eylmpgz,1567188651.0,Yeah I'm not sure why I make a big deal in my head. Especially if I make several and feel stupid and inadequate. Like this proves that I'm worthless and someone else can do a much better job than me so why am I even here.
musicals,eyk84l9,t1_eyk4x3n,1567140085.0,I haven't seen this! I'm keeping an eye out for musicals coming to my city.
NoStupidQuestions,eyinb21,t1_eyimfft,1567104750.0,"Makes sense. Do different smells have different size particles or something? Why do some smells stick more than others? 

Like if I bake cookies I dont smell like cookies even if the whole house does. But subway break smell sticks like crazy."
AskReddit,eyeby9y,t1_eydrgru,1567031650.0,ugh same! I think mine came from my first bf being a bit effeminate and it stuck.
depression,eyb1suk,t3_cw4fah,1566974141.0,"Yup. I like company but in small numbers and it's hard to find friends who genuinely care and you find it hard to open up in general and you end up lonely. I wish I can find a partner soon that I can enjoy solitude with. I dont want to talk much, but to find friends and sort through them and find ones that click you have to."
blackmirror,ey3m592,t1_ey3igc7,1566767857.0,lol this was disappointing. it's basically the same as porn addiction but they're obsessed with one porn star who they want to keep making more movies.
blackmirror,ey3idf7,t1_ey3gdik,1566765149.0,"Yeah like this episode doesn't even make a lot of sense so far...they're role playing but it doesn't feel like they're seeing the character as their friend, but as the visual?

idk so far in the ep it seems like they wouldn't sleep with each other in real life...idk how I feel about this whole premise"
pestcontrol,ey2yvun,t1_ey2ye69,1566751347.0,Really? It's not consistent. Mostly in the evening. And I dont see any flying around.
depression,ey1yubx,t1_ey1y0k1,1566716854.0,"hah my brain mostly goes ""if you die people will think 'ah it made sense and the clues were there all along. we shouldn't have blamed her for it.'""

I need to see a therapist."
relationships,ey1yowz,t3_cv4mis,1566716682.0,"I'm so sorry this has happened to you. But maybe be glad you found them before it turned to something else. Or he just has a crush on your sister (remember that bit in Love Actually?). He has to explain. His response to it didn't help his cause for innocence.

My ex bf got caught trying to take photos from underneath our bathroom door of our roommates showering. 

I realized that a month ago on his phone I had found a ""hidden camera"" recorder app that hides the camera app on the screen so people can't tell you're recording them. When I asked him he said he didn't know why he downloaded it and when I pressed him more he said it was to record his uncle saying funny things. I didn't really buy it, but I had no evidence to accuse him of anything. It gave me a lot of anxiety, but this was someone I had loved for years, so why expect the worst?

After he got caught by the roommate and I immediately broke up with him, he confessed that he had downloaded the app to try to take photos of girls' butts out in public. My ex said he ""gave him a rush"" because he was depressed.

It's just some kind of voyeurism that is very violating and creepy and objectifying. 

I'm not saying your husband has this or did something this extreme, but you need to ask him to explain. His reaction seemed to give away the fact that it was wrong."
depression,ey1xmrc,t1_ey1xg9l,1566715437.0,"Yeah I try really hard not to talk about it, but let it out if I'm cornered into a conversation about it. My room is messy when I'm at my worst and she will often focus on it and make grand predictions that because of this I will never find a partner or get married or have a family and completely ignore any other achievement I've made. As if that helps. One time she called me fat to ""shake me up"" to lose weight.

She doesn't know how to help and anytime I talk to her sometimes it comes off as supportive, but it just makes me feel even worse."
offmychest,ey1vrdl,t3_cv2lbx,1566713243.0,I saw a play the other day and part of it involves the characters walking around the audience before the show starts and I saw some loud talking across the rows of seats and thought something was going to happen. I hate that it's been ingrained in us now to watch out for these things.
offmychest,ey1pxsb,t1_ey1pj9o,1566707013.0,"My family does have a dog, but she doesn't get along with other dogs. I'm going to try to be more involved in school activities if I'm not too exhausted from work. i want to volunteer too if I have the time. I also think I have issues with dating intimacy in general. My brain seems to think if no one gets to know me, then I can't get hurt. 

I should go to therapy.

Thanks for your message."
pestcontrol,ey1lnwo,t1_ey1laxz,1566703095.0,I'll try...it's intermittent.
depression,exx2l6v,t3_cume81,1566629102.0,"Yeah same. I'm unfortunately in a public policy school and my classmates all want to solve the world's problems but the more I learn the more I realize that there is no point. People have been trying to fix things forever and clearly nothing has worked and we're now at this. Even ""good things"" like better medicine has created a huge population the earth cant support long term.

I've never liked people. We've ruined everything. My parents always thought I was odd for liking the company of pets more than people. 

Humans are the absolute worst."
depression,exx276c,t3_cujo33,1566628887.0,Me too. I'm not motivated to do well at my job because I dont even know what I want to use the money for. I just dont care.
depression,exwwifs,t1_exwu1ku,1566626218.0,"My psychiatrist on wednesday said my medication may have slowly stopped working and paired with stress has caused this decline. I believe it may also be hormonal and will be going an OBGYN. My thoughts towards myself have been extremely negative for several months now and everything makes me want to cry. When I told my regular doctor about my hormone concerns, she dismissed it as stress related, so I'm hoping the gyno tries to figure it out.

My psychiatrist also said ""you seem normal and just have some depression and anxiety dealing with regular life problems"" and didn't seem to think it was a big deal. It feels like a big deal to me when I feel like I don't deserve to live on a daily basis.

Also, the notebook wasn't given to me, it's my own. And I started using it as a method. I just picked up that notepad that was on my desk to use to finish it. I think what my manager did was rude, but I guess she doesn't know my issues. 

I'm mostly frustrated with myself and feel like a failure."
explainlikeimfive,exwhv8y,t1_exwhn8l,1566619627.0,The post I read was that his renewal was denied? Is that even possible? I try not to fall into sob stories if the facts aren't correct so I want to know what the process is.
Anxiety,exs3jpc,t1_exs0ue8,1566531262.0,"Thank you for your response. I'm glad things are getting better for you.

What kind of help did you get? I'm on medication that's stopped working (2nd time around) and am going to go to therapy after a few years of a break but it just feels like I'm paying someone to tell me it's going to be ok. Even my psychiatrist today said ""well we can refer you external therapists because you seem  normal and are dealing with general depression/anxiety and normal life issues"" I hate that she said normal because it sure doesnt feel normal to me. And I think I've become good at explaining myself so I come off as very calm and collected when I'm not. And I dont think needing to increase my medication is being normal.

I was good for a few years. I'm not sure what happened but my brain is suddenly short circuiting and digging up old memories and mistakes and ruminating. A few months ago I felt nothing but sadness, but now it's anxiety fueled as well.

I'm going to try to get better."
Anxiety,exryhvf,t1_exrp7hy,1566527322.0,It just feels like because of mistakes I've made my destiny is to feel bad enough to end it because I dont deserve to exist. Like I shouldnt be alive and evidence for that is my struggle with this.
