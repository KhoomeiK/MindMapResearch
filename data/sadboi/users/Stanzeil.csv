Here's my advice save money to get one!

Don't know how to drive?
Do so now!!!

It'll save you alot of money and work
Getting your own car
Plus you can get a car transportation job if you choose so.

Regardless if the school is far or close getting a car early in life will be very huge for you in your benefits
Right now I don't have my own I just use the old wagon my dad has behind because yes

I really love revenants story
From the look of it he's obviously mad that he's a robot wouldn't blame em lol. Sadly for him he'll never get no release as from previous lines he is really wanting to die and is very content with it but can't due Hammond bringing him back Everytime. 

I hope to see a Loba and revenant team-up against Hammond robotics...

I have so many questions such as
What happened after the war?

Where's jack Cooper?
BT?
Why are the Apex predators the owner of the Apex games? Or basically what lead to it?

Questions we'll have to wait a decade or never get.

I get people love Apex legends but I genuinely want Titanfall 3 who can blame the game was far superior than Apex legends but didn't get that kind of highlight it deserved for a game made in 2015 it had amazing graphics and mechanics.
