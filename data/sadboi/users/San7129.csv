kpopthoughts,fqub1yh,t3_gkyy1g,1589655497.0,"Hard to say for sure. EXO has talked a lot about how they wish to stay together, for the past 2 years they have really made a point on how close they are and that they want to continue being a group. Case in point, their wish of keeping the lineup despite the excessive hate for Jongdae's marriage and fatherhood.   

Now, we know its not necessary for the members to be under SM to still be a group. SNSD is an example. So some may not renew but still be in EXO.

Ive been a fan since debut and personally, I think the ones who will renew for sure are Chanyeol, Baekhyun, Suho, Sehun, Kai and Xiumin. I dont see why they wouldnt.

Jongdae is a tricky case since he has a family and i dont know what are his plans in terms of his solo career. He could be someone who is very lowkey, having collabs, releasing OSTs, that kind of stuff. Its all up in the air really

I can see Kyungsoo not renewing, and perhaps thats just me having PTSD from the article posted last year about him leaving SM that was later denied lol but I mean, Kyungsoo is someone who is very independent and reserved, he is not very interested in keeping an act for the fans because he is an idol and maybe he will want to focus more on his acting career which is very promising already. Again, im not sure, he is very unpredictable lmao

As for Yixing, he is the most likely to not renew because he already has enough power to stand on his own and he hasnt promoted with EXO since 2016. He doesnt need SM. He can still be a member but nothing will really change if he doesnt renew tbh

Edit: forgot to add this but I wish EXO could negotiate and get their own sub label like Super Junior. That would be neat."

I think the first time i truly realized I didnt like it anymore was when the cat appeared out of nowhere and just started to shoot medicine at the hashiras. Like what? That was so awfully convenient I had to laugh. It was also annoying how the Love Pillar was absent for 90% of the fight even though she wasnt as badly injured and then appeared for a second at the end only to die right after. Kanao was nowhere to be seen after Tanjiro woke up and conveniently shows up with extra medicine because it just so happens he was turned into a demon!

Also each of them deserve the chance to do what they like, be it release music that fits their style better or do activities in other fields they enjoy like acting or modeling. They arent so free to do that with exo. Baekhyun is building his name as a solo artist, Chanyeol has his studio, Jongdae has his family, Kai and Sehun must be working on their own stuff as well.
