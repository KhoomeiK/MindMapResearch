To circle back to the original argument, given they are ""worth"" billions and that worth is tied to companies retaining value, earnings, keeping shareholders happy and other sources of expectation, I don't see any future good-hearted billionaires saying ""sure I'll pay taxes owing without tax avoidance,"" costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. They're likely to....donate 25 million and get a credit on their tax returns instead.

I do not disagree that these people avoid taxes. But they often do it within the confines of their respective tax acts, which is why the acts are always updating to close loopholes.
