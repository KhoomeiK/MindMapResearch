Another Cyber security podcast is ""Cyber"" by motherboard.

This one talks about and about stories of past and current security issues.
It is good but more on the security side of the spectrum where as darknet diaries is more so story.


For the latter I listen to ""The Wizard and the Bruiser""

They have hour long episodes in which they discuss how certain things such as the Joker, Gorillaz, Stan Lee, Ghost in the Shell, Metroid, Invader Zim and other games, shows or creaters came to be.
