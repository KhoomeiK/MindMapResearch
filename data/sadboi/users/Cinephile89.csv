amiugly,fqwd36t,t3_gl8k17,1589700162.0,Person calling you ugly is jealous as others have said. Anyone in this thread saying your lips are a drawback is being subjective. Some folks kill (or pay) for lips like that. I ain't about ratings but you good.

FragileWhiteRedditor,fppv7ee,t1_fpptvew,1588809799.0,"I am glad we can come to common ground on at least one thing - fuck you too!

And no. This sub is not one meant to help white people learn. Did you read the description, the title, consider the content? Why would people on a sub like this want to spend time educating white people, and for free no less? I cannot grasp your thought process at all."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fppmqzj,t1_fppjog1,1588805165.0,"As I said. Those who are ""turned off"" by rudeness and derogatory terms are the ones being ridiculed in this sub. Rudeness and derogatory terms do not equate to systemic oppression racism and injustice. No racialized communities want their help because their help comes with caveats and expectations.

There's no other way to explain this beyond what I (rudely I admit - I'm not nice when it comes to these things and don't plan to be) and others (very nicely and politely) have already explained it. Your mind is clearly made up that you are right and all of the racialized people are wrong and going about things in the wrong way. That in and of itself says something."

I'm not turning away. I don't feel berated by this group because I know I'm not part of the problem. You are. You identify with the white people in these posts because you are a like them.

You do it for racialized people's children? Good lord your head is up your own ass. And if you won't help or be part of a solution to systemic racism inequality and injustice purely because it's wrong and regardless how you may be treated - you are a fragile white person. 

Yes you are still missing the mark but I suspect it's intentionally so and you are being wilfully ignorant."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fpms8sk,t1_fplzut0,1588740354.0,"99% of white people are - as the subs description and title say - fragile. The sub explains itself in the description. You are what the sub is rightly ridiculing. If what you see makes you ""turn away"" then all you want is racialized folks to be nice to you and congratulate you for being an ""ally""."
Beastars,fpdrycc,t1_fpa7jr3,1588533019.0,"Yeah! I see Yahya being a kind of teaser (though for anime only viewers I think they will do something to make it clear this is the ""Beastar"" of the title that we have been hearing about for so long). I could see them using flashbacks to hint at or show a bit more of Gosha or Leano (which would get around the timing issue). It's an adaptation and since it's not coming out weekly they do need to keep people interested. As for Juno and Louis I did mean the kiss but forgot about the timing....so I'm not sure on that one!"
Beastars,fpa5fu5,t1_fp94tcb,1588441184.0,"I'm almost certain this is correct - but I do think they will make an attempt to show Juno x Louis beginning, possibly a taste of Yahya, and more flashbacks of Legoshi and Gosha/his mom."

Get the fuck out of our space with your fetishizing bullshit. Posting politely that you are looking for trans folk and replying politely if someone else reaches out is fine.
BPD,f9cc5wp,t3_e4jgln,1575221759.0,"I'm not good with advice. And I usually lurk and don't post to much. But I wanted to make sure this post didn't go by without a response.

I can't imagine for one second what you are going through - I have been very lucky in life to have not lost anyone close enough to me to really hurt - let alone an FP.

Remember that you are likely not the only person grieving for this person. Maybe this is a chance to  use BPD to your advantage. A few times people have posted here about some of our ""superpowers"". Our empathy for example. If you knew your FP's parents, siblings, or other loved ones, could you reach out to them? It's possible they would love the chance to 1. Talk about this person to someone else who loved them and misses them and what's to remember them, and 2. Hear all your stories about this person - particularly how amazing they were and how great they made you feel (leave out the negatives of course!). 

I'm sorry if this is useless commentary. This situation is a nightmare for any of us who have an FP. I'm thinking about you."

Yo u/MordelDeBerde Reddit mobile sucks so I can't DM this to you but this is a good (and angering) article about AA in relation to alcohol abuse and the fact that they pretty much are the reason why real research and help for people who have difficulties with alcohol use can't get better help. Feel free to use in convos like these"

Lots of information on lack of effectiveness of AA, why it's the only real proposed solution to alcohol abuse in North America, and the other methods to curb alcohol abuse. 

**This is specifically about AA in relation to alcohol use though I expect there is likely much crossover**"
