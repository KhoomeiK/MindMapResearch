After thirty years of persistent talk therapy,  I now have a much healthier balance between I'd, Ego, and Super-Ego. My super-ego was so powerful because,  as a child, my father constantly criticized me.  I could never do anything right. As a result, my super-ego became very controlling,  a literal personification of my father. I realize that is not a very technical explanation vis-a-vis Freudian terminology,  but  I hope that helps all the same."

Mall leases, at least back in the mid to late 90s, were either 10 or 20-year leases.  I ran a mall bookstore in a very healthy mall. It's on life support now.  Anyway,  the weekly corporate paperwork arrived as usual one Monday, but it contained a report that it wasn't supposed to. Naturally,  I read it, not knowing what it was. I saw my store's rent: almost $25.00 per square foot. That means, in my mall, the average store with an average footprint paid $60,000 a month in rent.  Multiply that by the number of active leases, and you can appreciate how much money an owner or owners would be forsaking by giving a rent reprieve. 

In order for a mall to remain profitable ten or even 20 years down the road, they would, in theory,  have to increase the cost per square foot. I don't know by how much. That's why stores close, even if they're making a razor-thin profit"

deadmalls,fhe9g6m,t3_f2rcc1,1581517259.0,"I spent my youth and high school years in them. Ad a child, we'd go to the mall as a family. You could do all kinds of things besides shop, depending on the mall: Bowl, watch a movie,  go to the arcade, ice skate at an indoor rink, eat at a sit down place or, later,  the food  court, plus, all your friends and neighbors were there, so you could socialize. That's why 70s malls had sunken seating areas, fountains with seating,  etc.

It was great as a kid because my parents would cut me loose,  so I could go anywhere in the mall, as long as I met up with them at a designated spot by a certain time. Talk about freedom at 12!

I spent hours in mall bookstores. 

You went to the mall for everything from snow tires to perfume to a garbage disposal to pianos.

In the Big 80s it was even more fun. I worked in high school and could blow $75.00 on a pair of nice sunglasses (1985 price, mind you) and not miss the money. My friends were either at the beach, mall, or working when we weren't in school.

Later, in my 20s, I managed a mall bookstore chain. The day a customer told me not to order a book for him because he could get it from you know where, I started looking for another job.

So, please forgive my long-winded response, but that's the long part of my answer: Memories. 

Here's the other part: I 'm not sure because it depresses the hell out of me but I do anyway. There's something tragic about seeing dead malls,  especially the slowly dying one's.  It's like a bad car wreck: You don't want to look, but you do anyway."
