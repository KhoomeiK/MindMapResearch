Celexa -cries a lot.... because celexa is an antidepressant...designed to treat depression symptoms like crying a lot. Or, maybe like, I saw ""seroquel -cant be psychotic if you're asleep"" because seroquel is an antipsychotic that can cause extreme fatigue."

Christianity,f19sqp2,t3_d8dsea,1569277662.0,"I don't think it's necessarily that we need Christ because we cannot ""make it up to God"" when we sin.

I look at this way: Human beings are sinners by our very nature. Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden which causes every person born to have sin in the fabric of his or her being. God is holy, just, and perfect. And by His nature, sinful beings cannot enter into His presence. Also, a holy, just God is morally obligated by His justice to punish sin. A sin is a trespass of His perfect law. Because God must punish sinners, Christ came and paid the price for it. He took upon Himself the entire punishment and weight of our sins, thereby making our forgiveness possible. We do not have our own righteousness, but we are given His when we trust Him as Lord and Savior.

I hope this helps!

All the best to you!"
bipolar,ex87kdy,t1_ewynhzp,1566069785.0,"Ok. I understand. Trust me, I do. I spent YEARS in therapy, every week and I had nothing to show for it. But it was NOT my therapist's fault. 

As bipolar patients, we HAVE to take some responsibility! It's completely unfair to expect a certain pill or a person with a degree to fix us and make everything better. I've been through this myself and I didn't improve until *I* wanted to.

But once i got sick and tired of being hopeless, I started taking medication and WORKING in therapy. And I have my moments where it hits me hard but I'm able to recover so much more quickly than ever! My circumstances aren't always perfect but they are SO much better than before! 

You can do it, but you have to want it.

I'm not sure what you expected to hear when you posted this.....

But, it is not hopeless unless you decide it is."

She sounds like she was using you. And you have every right to block her. I'm not sure if you've done it already, but cut off her Netflix access. If she wants it, she can pay. Apologies to the neighbor who was paying her part. 

And, remember, harassment is a crime!"
bipolar,ewyd218,t1_ewvyuko,1565878969.0,"Thanks! I forgot about NAMI and DBSA! Great point about their intrinsic design to help with the anxiety! 

This particular program is SO different than the one I was privileged to be a staff member at a couple of years ago in Tennessee. It was a very small town, too. Now, I'm in Miami Dade county which is huge. 

Perhaps, the long drive is worth it compared to this. Also, I'm very stable now and I would hate to take the place in the program rather than someone who desperately needs it. 

Thank you so much! Definitely things for me to consider."
bipolar,ewycb5l,t1_eww8588,1565878599.0,You're welcome. I sincerely hope you take care of yourself and do whatever you need to do. Wishing you the absolute best for your life!!!
bipolar,ewybuzh,t1_ewvxl77,1565878379.0,"I definitely understand your frustration! It sounds like medications have been incredibly difficult for you. Maybe you could try to take the absolute lowest dose possible. And running is a great coping skill! Sometimes when we receive a bipolar diagnosis, we mistakenly expect the medicine to fix everything. It doesn't. It can't. It can be a very helpful aid, but we have to cooperate with it and do our part, too, like finding coping skills! Awesome job with the running! So, maybe if you found a medication that helped, taking the lowest dose would hopefully minimize side effects and you could work more on learning to use more coping skills. I understand bipolar is a brain disease, but there is so much more to recovery and stability than just taking pills. Talk to your psychiatrist honestly and see if you can find an answer. And if you're not already, get in therapy! 

Honestly, I swear, I'm speaking from experience. I tried medication forever and it helped, but it has its limitations. I still take my meds faithfully, but so much of my stability relies on my practice of cognitive behavioral skills. 

I'm NOT advocating giving up on meds. They have their place. But I dont want you to feel like you're sacrificing physical health for mental health. There IS a balance to be found. I hope you find it!!!"
bipolar,eww1nf6,t3_cqdv3m,1565818531.0,Yes. Yes.
bipolar,eww1k98,t3_cqd6dt,1565818478.0,"I hear you.

I'm also incredibly sorry this is where you have found yourself after ten whole years. 

I relate, and I hope this was your depression talking. I honestly hope you feel better soon. 

Maybe try to focus on the things that are actually better, those areas where you have improved!! I'm certain there are positives you could also easily list!

All the best to you, honestly."

bipolar,eww0fn9,t3_cqegtg,1565817798.0,"I'm in the US, and I'm on disability. Honestly, it's a big pain in the ass. You have to have so much documentation and even then, you usually have to be evaluated by a government psychiatrist. 

I applied in 2008 after years of mental health treatment and an episode that brought with it four felony charges, not guilty by reason of insanity, and 60 days in the state psych ward.

I know people who got it with a lot less, but I can only speak regarding my experience. But if you're not currently seeing a psychiatrist and therapist, your chances are slim. 

It took two years, going before a disability judge, and a call to the senator's office for me to get approved. 

The money is not much at all! The only really good benefit is the health insurance. 

If you can work at all, find the motivation! And trust me, if you can work honestly, the social security office will not give you disability. 

I've been on it for 11 years. I spent 3 of those years in group homes, but the money is barely enough to get me by. I have nothing extra. I tried working again last year, but got fired because I was hallucinating demons in the parking lot. I caused quite a stir and had no idea they werent real.

It's a good option for those seriously ill people. But I wouldn't recommend it unless you had zero other options.

Sorry to be a downer. I was trying to be honest. It's really not a desirable option.

But, if you do want to apply, I believe you can go to www.socialsecurity.gov and apply. Or you might be able to apply over the phone. The number is on their website.

Best of luck! Maybe, get a therapist or case manager to help you navigate the job world if you decide not to apply."
bipolar,ewvyv22,t3_cqekuw,1565816852.0,Congratulations!! Keep up the hard work!!!
bipolar,ewvxkeu,t3_cqfatj,1565816068.0,"It's difficult, for sure. And I definitely relate to finding a very strong attraction to things like alcohol and cannabis. 

Sometimes, it literally feels like nothing else can slow those racing thoughts. You are not alone! 

The problem is that alcohol has very serious consequences. And if cannabis causes you to be paranoid, it's not a viable option for you.

If you can, I definitely recommend seeing a psychiatrist. They can help you treat the symptoms that you've been self-medicating. There have been amazing advances with psychiatric medications, and it's a WAY better alternative to becoming an alcoholic. 

If you can't get professional help, attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. They're completely free and you don't even have to talk. But it might help to hear some stories of people who gave in to the attraction of alcohol. 

And also, when my thoughts are racing like crazy and I can't slow down or sleep, it helps to write it down. Even if it makes no sense. Just write. Everything. Anything. Also, Benadryl can help, but it will make you sleepy. Distractions like TV can help, too. If you can get out of your head and find something to focus on, it helps.

Try to avoid caffeine, too. For me, that energizes my thoughts. 

Please don't continue down the road you're on. I promise, it looks good and seems like it's the only thing helping, but it is lying to you! 

Get some help. Now. 

You're worth it!"
bipolar,ewvw3db,t3_cqegfg,1565815188.0,"Hey! Sorry you're going through all this! It's definitely not fun and I can relate. As I understand things, bipolar 1 mania and mixed states can include symptoms of psychosis. The difference between that and schizoaffective disorder is that the psychosis occurs apart from a mood episode whereas someone with bipolar only exhibits psychotic symptoms simultaneously with a mood episode. 

It definitely sounds like your hallucinations are occurring within a mood episode, but I'm not an expert. 

I don't know if you've tried Lithium as a mood stabilizer, but it definitely helps me with mania, which minimizes my mania-induced psychosis. It's also a favorite among old school psychiatrists for treating acute mania. It may be a good option if you find antipsychotics are intolerable. 

But remember, a lot of times, it's give and take, at least until they find a miracle drug. Because they all have side effects. For some, those side effects are preferable to the havoc caused by being unmedicated. 

I really hope you feel better soon! And, don't listen to that voice in your head!!! If you want to talk or anything, I'm here. Best of luck, and keep reaching out!"
bipolar,ewvuog0,t1_ewvnznn,1565814329.0,Wow! I would NEVER survive that. Thanks for the response. I'm supposed to go speak to an admissions counselor Friday. I'll definitely ask about accommodations and their attendance policy.
