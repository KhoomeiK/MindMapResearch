IWantOut,f1f4cxz,t3_d92yxf,1569436748.0,"Hi! My husband and I are in our 30‚Äôs and are also thinking about making the move from US to Netherlands. My cousins live there and I‚Äôve had a few conversations with them regarding this. I also grew up in Germany so learning Dutch shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for me but that‚Äôs not a necessity at the beginning at least in Netherlands because almost everyone speaks fluent English. The best way to do it is to find either a Dutch company to work for, or find a recruiter that can help you find a Dutch company to work for. I think you can do searches on google and LinkedIn.

We are going try to move if things don‚Äôt turn out so great for the both of us here soon. Best of luck ‚ô•Ô∏è"

TherapeuticKetamine,f1c4d7b,t3_d8q31n,1569349630.0,"I‚Äôve been having the same issue lately. I did a booster a week ago and could not disassociate at all. I haven‚Äôt increased my dosage in benzo and even went completely without it during the infusion. I hated not being to disassociate and kept checking my limbs etc. towards the end my anxiety kicked in cuz I felt so uncomfortable and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. 

I‚Äôve had infusions before where I‚Äôve gotten high doses of benzo‚Äòs in iv form before or during the infusion. I disassociated just fine then. Specifically, during my first 6 infusions. I got strong benzo‚Äôs like versed. And or Ativan in iv form. So idk. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that.

I‚Äôm now on lozenges and my theory is that my tolerance has gone up. Don‚Äôt be shy in asking for a higher dosage until you feel relief. 

You may just be one of those people who builds a tolerance very quickly!! 

Albeit not being able to disassociate, I still feel the positive effects the next few days. It‚Äôs just not as great.

Edit: I did a google search and found this article very helpful. [https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/ketamine-tolerance/](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/ketamine-tolerance/)"

TherapeuticKetamine,f1aen4t,t1_f1a1nqg,1569291972.0,"Yup, start there. At the times where infusions are impossible for me to afford, Lozenges have been an absolute life saver. 

As far as frequency and dosage goes, my clinic is having me kind of color outside the lines and figure it out myself. Taking days off is a huge help. Sometimes a higher dose gives me relief. Sometimes a smaller. It‚Äôs not a necessity to take them every day. 

We have a discord channel where we discuss our lozenge and infusion experiences if you‚Äôre interested."

TherapeuticKetamine,f1abs8i,t1_f1aa57o,1569289919.0,"I mean if you‚Äôre able to take it even earlier in the day then it‚Äôs better. It‚Äôs just hard for me to find the time during the day. Specially, when you‚Äôre taking it every day. It‚Äôs more manageable to put some time aside earlier during the day if you‚Äôre taking breaks in between which is recommended.

Edit: by that I mean, really clearing my schedule for at least 40 minutes and telling people to please not disturb me during that time. They still barge in ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. And then 1 hour after to sober up completely to be able to go on with the rest of my day."

TherapeuticKetamine,f15eb5r,t3_d7qqn0,1569188846.0,"Ask for a Benzo next time before they give you the Injection. I usually get it and decided to tough it out this last time. I had a panic attack the whole last part of my infusion where I felt uncomfortable, anxious and cold for some reason and couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I still got the benefits two days later but I so wish I had just asked for the benzo."
TherapeuticKetamine,f11rxl4,t3_d7kocy,1569129721.0,"I always see the spinning light and tunnels of cubic looking things when I get infusions and or take lozenges and the tunnels change color and shapes based on what I‚Äôm listening to. I always thought I was seeing something else than physical. And I‚Äôve come to realize recently that I think that it‚Äôs just synesthesia and our eyes trying to make sense of signals it‚Äôs receiving while the traffic cop is asleep. I have definitely experienced ego death under ketamine and even though it‚Äôs been frightening it was also peaceful. 

I envy people who actually trip and get epiphanies/insights beyond what I think about day to day. I wonder if I‚Äôm the only one who feels like this under ketamine. For example, last infusion I couldn‚Äôt stop crying towards the end and the nurse asked me what had come up that made me feel that way. And all I could say was:‚Äù nothing.... I just felt overwhelmingly sad.‚Äù 

So your story and his question have made me wonder if I‚Äôm not getting the most benefit from ketamine since my trips are usually just silence with not many insights. 

I am glad you are getting so much out of these infusions. One less person that suffers in this world makes me happy. ‚Äú May all beings be happy everywhere...‚Äù üôèüèª"

TherapeuticKetamine,f0xm072,t1_f0xlg47,1569037160.0,"Well, my clinic has been very open minded about what dosage I need at home. They‚Äôve seen me howl/cry under ketamine infusions and I think that‚Äôs why they have been so open minded and I‚Äôm very grateful!  I‚Äôve also been trying to come off the last ssri I‚Äôve been on ( Effexor) and so I was having a very hard time. They have been working with me. Asking me to take a dosage until I feel relief and tell them what that dosage was. I‚Äôm a small gal but I needed a stronger dose and so the whole weight/gram calculation didn‚Äôt work for me. I do take days off for tolerance break. And that was recommended by them as well. 

It‚Äôs tricky. Because there haven‚Äôt been enough studies out yet. Bioavailability is not great with the spray and it‚Äôs ok with lozenges. My clinic does not recommend the nasal spray because they believe you can‚Äôt tell how much you‚Äôre taking. It gets complicated when mucus is involved. Im rambling now. That‚Äôs a topic for another discussion.... But if it wasn‚Äôt for ketamine I probably wouldn‚Äôt be alive right now."
TherapeuticKetamine,f0xld4s,t3_d6z8u2,1569036511.0,"I‚Äôm 32. Female. Have had mdd and Gad for 10 years now and tried every ssri on the planet, tms, Fischer Wallace at home. I have been getting infusions since October of 2018 and got a booster in April of this year. When I got the booster AND lozenges prescribed to take at home is when I saw a huge change. It‚Äôs a hard road to find the right dosage and stabilize but I always say this : it‚Äôs worth it!"

politics,f0uzdpq,t1_f0kxjzt,1568956419.0,"Idk why people downvoted your comment. I understand what you‚Äôre saying. I actually am prescribed ketamine lozenges which cost close to zilch and insurance will not cover it. So big Pharma came up with their ‚Äú own‚Äù ketamine.. s-ketamine. And insurance companies may or may not cover it depending on what plan you have. They are not the same drug but that‚Äôs a topic for another discussion.

On the flip side, I was on an ssri that was working for me. Brintelix. With minimal side effects. But my insurance ( shout out to Oscar ) simply denied to cover it because of its cost ($2000 for one month- US). That‚Äôs why I was then put on Effexor as a replacement and it‚Äôs nearly killed me. Also, I found out that brintelix costs only $40 a month in Australia. 

So yes, big Pharma wants you to be on the expensive medication but Insurance companies are starting to deny coverage for expensive medications. 

It‚Äôs not fun needing medications for mental illness in the US of A. My illness is just $$$ to big Pharma.

Edit: in Australia not on. 

And specifically, I think new insurance companies such as Oscar are starting to deny coverage for expensive medications because I can go fuck myself or take a drug more addictive than heroine cuz it‚Äôs cheap ( Effexor.)"
