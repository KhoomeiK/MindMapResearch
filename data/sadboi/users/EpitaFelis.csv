I really, highly doubt that to be honest. The fact that you're not sure if his attempts at breaking your boundaries are normal or not, suggests you're not recognising his other bad behaviours as such. I suggest (whether you break up or not) you examine your relationship more closely. Does he always respect your bodily autonomy? Or does he sometimes push for certain things? What else does he do that maybe doesn't sit quite right with you? If you look up red flags in relationships, do any of them sound familiar?
