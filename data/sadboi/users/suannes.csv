diabetes_t2,fksfmmi,t3_fk8jqi,1584488987.0,Thanks for your supportive comments.  When I get very frustrated I start to cry and was so nervous on the phone because my voice was cracking.  Don't know if I want to pursue it any further. Just bite the bullet and pay.  I did that with my retiree dental insurance. Paying $400 per quarter and getting back $5 and $10 checks when I saw the dentist for regular care. I dropped it. Maybe Boomers don't have it as good as some think
diabetes_t2,fksf3qv,t1_fkr8o4b,1584488651.0,"Yes, that's what's so frustrating.  It takes forever on the phone to get NO information. Customer Service keeps putting me on hold and comes back to tell me exactly what the letter said.Just that it's not on formulary any longer.  Can't tell me why or what they suggest instead or anything I don't already know. What a waste of time. I was very polite and then asked for a supervisor.  They said the exact same thing. Had no further insight."
diabetes_t2,fksen5t,t1_fkrfzy7,1584488358.0,"Yes, thank you, I am in US and I will do that.  I think I'd like to self-pay rather than switch but it's so annoying. Everybody's on this stuff and it feels like the Insurance companies are trying to kill off us old folks ASAP"

Documentaries,fj8c4yx,t3_fbwnyn,1583109939.0,"Unfortunately, I was there. Not in the towers but in a nearby building on Broad St.  While escaping to find a way home there was pandemonium in the streets of lower Manhattan and people were saying that people were jumping. My mind tried to protect myself by saying that it couldn't be, it was just all the papers falling.  People were mistaken.  

My PTSD doesn't allow me to look at pictures or watch any videos of the event."

SchittsCreek,fes9mso,t1_fen2hfv,1579362940.0,"Annie was very sweet and was a toned down version of her character. 

When asked if she could play any other character in the show, who would it be, she said Bob. Similar wrist action and she did the wrist thing.  

Also she took home a menu from the cafe as a memento.

Johnny said he wanted the bell that never worked from the desk at the motel and when he went back for it, it was gone."

AskOldPeople,exjdhxi,t3_ct16zi,1566347699.0,"I started during the Boston Marathon Bombing.  I became obsessed with getting the latest information as quickly as possible and,  in those days, Reddit streamed the latest from every possible source. But they got into trouble with that and no longer do it. I miss that."
AskOldPeople,ewqcs9u,t1_ewq7fwy,1565662500.0,"I was 14 and heard them on the radio and immediately felt there was something special. Found out they recorded for Capital Records and wrote to them asking for info.  They responded that they were coming to NY in February. Made calls and wrote letters (no internet in those days so information was not easy to come by) and found out their first concert would be at Carnegie Hall, a couple of days before appearing on Ed Sullivan Show.  No one else knew who they were so we went to box office and got front row seats.  Their popularity grew like wildfire. On the day in February of 64, we heard they were trying at Plaza hotel so we went there hoping for a glimpse. There were thousands of girls there screaming and crying. The Concert was great. I swear George looked me right in the eye and went on to see them at Shea Statium, Forest Hills and almost eery time they preformed in NY over their short time together.Adoring them and dreaming about them was probably some of the best years of my life."

AskReddit,et2utxy,t1_et2mloa,1562423104.0,Sounds like things aren't a whole lot better even after 40 years.  I guess when it's a woman's problem it doesn't get that much attention.  That's sad to see.  I was told the only cure was pregnancy and I wasn't planning on that. As time went on it got worse and I ended up having a surgery to remove a tube and ovary and immediately go pregnant at the age of 40.  My baby is 30 now and I'm happy to have her but those early years of the monthly agonizing pain were awful.
AskReddit,et29im6,t1_et18nj3,1562413234.0,I had. Endometriosis in the early 70's before it had been properly diagnosed. Can tell you how many Gino's suggested I see a psychiatrist. I used to pass out from the pain
