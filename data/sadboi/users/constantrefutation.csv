I'd just try to be chill around the little guy until you know him a little better, some cats are jumpier than others. Next time you see him try to see if he passes by a specific spot or area and focus on leaving treats or food there. The more interactions you have with him, the more he might grow to trust you"
cats,fnnv3sq,t1_fnnuas0,1587102652.0,"I always let cats (including my own) sniff my hand before going to pet it. I'm not sure the science of it but I think it helps the cat get a sense of you and learn that you wont just try to grab it. it can be sorta like asking consent I guess.

cats are pretty smart and can learn their own names and certain words. maybe you can pick a name or greeting that you say in the same way every time you greet this kitty.

I'm no expert but showing the cat you're not a threat at all can help. like try sitting down when the little guy is around, maybe even at a distance so it might choose to come to you. bring a piece of string or an extra shoelace as a makeshift toy and try to play with it. lots of cats love chasing string.

lots of treats is good too, just know that the more you feed him the more he might expect to be fed."

Before I started it I had to rely on benadryl and zzzquil to help get me tired. My quality of sleep was very bad also. Since I started it its helped me feel tired before I try to lay down and sleep, and my sleep quality has definitely improved. Gives me long crazy dreams though. Besides helping with sleep, I haven't noticed much else yet, but I'm on a pretty low dose to start (150 mg) and I might be increasing soon, so we'll see. I'm told by my psychiatrist that it can help with the depression part of bipolar, and I'm pretty thrilled at how it's worked for me so far. I'd say I'm optimistic about it. The hangover like day drowsiness seems to have worn off after my body has gotten more used to it."
bipolar,fmyr1zj,t3_fy87r9,1586493251.0,"when I was voluntarily admitted a few years ago, it was for 9 days. If I recall correctly, I was discharged both when I felt I was ready and when the doctors there felt I was ready. It did take a few days of feeling the idea out and making sure I was ready. I dont think you can say you want to leave at any moment, you have to discuss it with your caseworker I believe. I do think that they take into consideration that you are voluntary in their discharging process, so it could help things move a little faster than involuntary patients. This is just my experience in Washington state, I'm not sure what it's like elsewhere"
bipolar,fmttgpk,t1_fmrsmq8,1586378713.0,"I've found that apps that have reminders help hold me accountable. Daylio is the mood tracking app I use and you can enter goals, and if you complete each goal eventually you get a little achievement. It makes it a little more fun. Other than that I just try to imagine how gross I'll feel if I dont wash my face or wash my pillowcase. I have really oily but dry flaky skin so I get really uncomfortable really fast. Plus, if you wash your face before bed it might eliminate the need to wash your pillowcase as often, so you could always take one thing at a time and try the face washing thing first. 

Having a good smelling face wash and fun washcloths can help establish a routine that eventually becomes more of a nice thing you do for yourself than a chore. I really like Burts Bees Orange Essence face wash, it smells soooooo good! It's like 5$ at walmart. Building good habits take a little time, so it's important to give yourself wiggle room and space to take a few nights off if you're just not up to it."

bipolar,fmrq900,t3_fx1flz,1586331526.0,"I've been picking my skin since I was a little girl. It's a huge problem for me and causes me a lot of distress at times when my face is just covered in giant red spots. I dont think I've had clear skin with zero picked spots in like years now. It seems to come in waves. If my acne flares up, I'll pick at it and itll get worse for literally months. I haven't been able to stop completely, so my psychiatrist recommended I see a dermatologist. The reasoning is that if there's no acne to pick at, the urge won't be so bad.

I've been trying to wash my face every night before bed and changing my pillowcase often and that seems to control the huge break outs. Better than doing nothing I suppose. Also if I have to pick, I try to wash my hands really good so I dont cause an infection that takes weeks to heal. One thing that is super helpful for me is to not go after pimples that aren't ready yet or ones that I know will be hard to pop. Those are the ones that usually turn into a huge ordeal on my face and causes me a lot of embarrassment and regret.

For regular scabs that aren't acne, I guess I would recommend replacing the urge to pick those with a different activity that's pleasant to distract you. Maybe something that's self care like putting on lotion or making a cup of tea. Coloring, art or puzzle books like word searches can keep your hands busy and mind focused on something else. Put bandaids on your spots so theres a barrier. If you're like me and find yourself picking without realizing that you started doing it, literally sit on your hands everytime you notice you're picking. I've heard of some people wearing gloves so they physically are unable to pick, although that one seems a bit annoying to me personally. Finally, cutting your fingernails can help too. It just makes it a little harder to do your habit.

Sorry for the giant response, it's just that I deal with skin picking every day of my life and I know how hard it is to handle it. I think a big part of easing up on the skin picking is understanding why you do it, if there's a reason. Stress is a big trigger for myself. Another part is being gentle with yourself and realizing that progress might start slow, but you'll get there eventually if you keep at it. Good luck! I believe we both can have success if we start with little changes at first."
bipolar,fmo4t62,t3_fwfqze,1586245400.0,"One time when I was hospitalized, there was a guest speaker and she was describing how she felt when she was depressed and how she felt when she was stable. She said that when she was depressed, she would realize it in the early stages when she stood on her porch and didn't hear the birds singing. Normally she would hear the birds and enjoy their songs. I'll never forget it because it reminds me to notice things that bring me joy, and when theres an absence of those things it's a warning sign. For me my warning sign is finding zero satisfaction in my whole day. Usually I do at least one thing a day that gives me satisfaction or makes myself proud or content, and when that isnt happening for a few days, I know to step up my self care.

I'd like to imagine being stable feels like having a typical life of tasks, problems, situations and interactions but being level headed and critical enough to make good choices and grow as a person."

bipolar,flfsumv,t3_fokmf3,1585116540.0,"I like to tell whoever's in my life specifically what to expect in my behaviors. Sometimes I'll write it down for them and also include what they can say or do that helps and what to avoid. I've found that if I'm clear about my needs and what's happening, I get better support and results from people around me because they feel prepared.

One thing that helps me A LOT is reducing any unnecessary stress in my life. Like maybe I'll stay home instead of going to the store. Sometimes I'll make lists because it helps me feel more in control and like I have a plan. I try to increase good moments by doing things I enjoy. If I absolutely cannot get away from my feelings, I'll take some ""me time"" and give myself time to really feel my emotions and dwell on it for a second. journaling or listening to sad music helps me but I try to limit my time so i dont get stuck."
bipolar,flfrsc0,t3_foknn8,1585115461.0,"I used to be so scared of the dark and the monsters in it when I was living in my parents house. My room was in the basement and going up the stairs to use the bathroom was terrifying, I always felt like there was something awful lurking in the darkness right behind me. I would sprint up the stairs four at a time out of fear, only to have to walk past a ton of windows looking out to a dark yard. I would freak out thinking of all sorts of horrible possibilities of what was in the dark. Now that I've moved out the fear isnt so bad, but I still get freaked out if I think about it too much.

I now view that desicion as a mistake. I know for a fact I will be devastated and sad and lonely, this person does care for me very much, and in some ways I also care. I also think that it's an unhealthy and unfulfilling relationship at the same time. These feelings persist through all mood states, so I believe it to be a genuine concern of mine.

sometimes when this person does or says something that is extremely upsetting to me, I'll take a second, truly feel all the negative emotions that come flooding in, and tell myself to remember it well when I've broken up with them finally, because I know I'll be hurting and very very sad. I have a tendency to get back together with people once its ended, so I'm really trying to cement accurate ""snapshots"" of  how I feel unmasked by sadness."

I still haven't revealed its location to him even though he asks occasionally. it's super upsetting to me that I have to be the responsible one with HIS gun when I'm way more suicidal than he is for the most part. guns are super dangerous for depressed and suicidal people and I hate that its here in the apartment at all. 

good job for standing your ground though, youre not wrong to feel uncomfortable about them and it literally should never be something you have to be in contact with if you have expressed that you dont like them."

bipolar,ff7vcl6,t1_ff7uzjd,1579659236.0,"shes a psychiatrist yes. I asked for seroquel the first visit but her reasoning was to wait and see what the sleep study said. and she wanted to see the ""real"" me without me using weed to cope. I'm sure she will prescribe something eventually but I dont see the hold up since I'm in compliance. I'm on lithium and she prescribed gabepentin to ""help with cravings"" while I stopped smoking. I'm going to keep my next appointment but if the situation doesnt improve, I'm definitely firing her and finding someone else to help."

bipolar,ff56g1w,t3_ermiyb,1579581576.0,"I recently spent a lot of time on google trying to figure out how to filter myself. theres some pretty good tips but hard to put in practice. the worst part is that I truly feel right about my feelings but feel horrible about letting them out while emotional. it's like a pressure building in me and I have to say whatever awful point I have. 

lately I try to think of my thoughts as clouds. just let them pass by if it's not kind or if it doesnt improve the silence. I also try to think of how person might respond to the thought I'm thinking of saying. if I can prevent a huge ordeal then I'll try to just shut up"
