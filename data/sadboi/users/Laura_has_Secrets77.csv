It was like regular story time where you gather round the fire and he'd just talk about his violent, abusive father and how lucky we are.

There were points in the beginning that didn't make sense, only for it to complete an over all, bigger picture thing that was revealed later. Like how and why all the plantations are together. I don't want to get angry just yet. I also understand publishers and others in charge tend to get in the way of creativity and rush things, so I don't want to blame the writer on this, at least, not just yet.

Yeah, you could be right. I've read that the writer likes to go the opposite direction of what we expect/want, so who knows? If your logic is right, then neither will Ray, which means Emma could be next. I hope not. I like her. I do wanna see Norman go villain a lil bit, show his darkness more. Maybe show him have a meltdown? The kid is already unhealthy with his obsessions to solve big deal, adult problems when he was only 11. No kid should go through that, it makes me sad thinking about all the shit he has gone thrown before even turning freaking 16. I really wish we could see him and Ray interacting more, maybe Ray could help him a lil because he understands that kind of isolation."
thepromisedneverland,fprp0u8,t1_fpqumqu,1588859191.0,"I think part of it is that the writer (and probably moreso the publishers) wants there to be thirty volumes max, but ideally more like 20-22. The last couple of chapters felt like one action-packed chore after another. Stopping the genocide, killing the queen, stopping the army from getting to the shelter, etc etc. It just never really gave the characters moments to pause and reflect. I feel like reflection is important to see development in the characters. 

See I feel like Emma could stay behind, but I also see Norman actually dying or something to do with his mortality happening because his health is rapidly declining already as we see it. I think one redditor suggested that she wants to stay behind, and then the other children, probably led by Ray or someone else tries to go back to the demon world to get her, which I could see but that's also a lot of chapters and volumes that I'm not sure the writer has room for. I have a sinking feeling that either there is no human world, or once they get over to it, it's like world war 3 and everything is dilapidated and bombed and nuked, and you just see people hiding in the ruins shooting at each other. I don't know, they may just have to face late capitalism, which is also a terrible fate, LOL."
thepromisedneverland,fpmyosi,t1_fpmoo77,1588745202.0,"Also, I hope you don't think I disagree! I was just adding some thought. ðŸ˜Š That's a great point! I really wish we could have some side manga thing (sleep deprived, cant think words) about lambda and what went down. 
There's so much going on in this very interesting universe that I feel it would be near impossible to cover everything. 
I also feel that some of our expectations will change once the last chapters come out.

I still love the story and the universe but really wish they went more into details about a lot of things, including lambda. Like, the demons lives. I would have loved to see the demons already aware that their government is fucking them and they are powerless to it, because that is reflective of real life! And instead of seeing them easily switch over to Mujika, instead have a bunch of em protest, demand the rights of human lives as well as their own! A God damn revolution! And where is the story of sonju meeting Mujika, how he changed, how he balecame her guard basically, maybe even more?

And as for the police officer thing, I've known a lot of people in blue, as well as in the military, who got married, it's that exact intense trust and loyalty that creates deep intimacy and an unbreakable bond."
thepromisedneverland,fpjfhwv,t3_gbkfsy,1588666582.0,"Just because he admits feelings for her doesn't mean she reciprocates. It irks me how people assume it will be Canon because he admitted feelings for her. She seems oblivious to both characters and not at the point of maturity to where she would be interested in crushes, but I could be wrong. Norman also is unhealthily obsessed with her, but it makes sense, considering his trauma combined with going through puberty and still being very immature. I don't have much to say for Ray and Emma, although he views her as a person, rather than an object on a pedestal like Norman does, and I'd rather that than Noremma, but really I'm not gunning for anything. I'm a SonjuxMujika fan myself."
thepromisedneverland,fpjf4k0,t1_fpfrl1i,1588666207.0,"This. The awareness the demons got about their corrupt government and how they change their opinion easily bc they don't think for themselves is a strong message but was executed cheesily bc it was all rushed. Really wish they didn't bring back Lewis. Also, I love Emma's ideals and she does do a lot, she's the negotiator, with the people skills, which is hella important in politics but looked past a lot bc she's not like Norman or Ray, the ""traditional"" image of intelligence. However, you don't get to enjoy that and see it bc you don't see much development from her. People who are optimists still have gone through their own internal trials and weren't always so sunny. Wisdom comes from experience and empathy, and cynicism, but you don't get to see that with her. Really wish Emma would at least doubt herself more and have moments of cynicism and depression."
thepromisedneverland,fpb3fit,t1_fo9m5w5,1588461296.0,"Duuuude I agree! I loved how he and Ray basically switch spots in terms of supporting Emma's ideas. It was very interesting to see how they changed as they got older and it's also just a common thing for friends to drift apart as they become different people, and often times do disagreeable things that end up hurting the friendship. I thought something was going to happen like Norman would get so caught up in his scheming that he gets Emma seriously injured or something and has to face the consequences of that. Kinda bummed in a way that that didn't happen, but it's also refreshing to see his friends not give up on him and him come out of it on the better end."

YouOnLifetime,fds68yz,t1_fdql444,1578695291.0,"Yeah, I'm on board with most of what you're saying, until you say 'bad behavior' and then you lose me. And most abusers do have mental health problems. I spent most of my life sympathizing for people who abused me and others bc of their suffering and all it did was keep me trapped in their abuse"
