Your first car probably shouldn't be a BMW.  Anything modern can be kept reliable enough to start every day and never leave you by the side of the road, but it just takes a lot more expensive and complicated work to do so with a BMW.  

BMWs, luxury cars (except Lexus), sports cars, and the like, tend to have complicated bleeding-edge technology to wring out as much performance as the engineers can muster.  

Civics, Toyotas, etc., tend to use well-proven, extensively-tested, slightly older technology, or simpler, less expensive parts that lead to fewer breakdowns and easier, less expensive repairs.

I can say from personal experience that the Mazda Tribute/Ford Escape twins can be a good AWD choice for relatively cheap if you happen to find a well maintained one without too much rust.  (Get it inspected--a lot of the high mileage ones aren't worth paying more than a ""beater"" price.)

Not the most fun to drive as an on-road daily (nor are Honda, Toyota, or most Subarus other than WRX/STI), but Tribute/Escape has decent ground clearance and a capable electronic AWD system, so it has ""mine can go anywhere your Subaru can go"" covered.  A V6 is a plus for fun, especially the 2009-2012, which has 240 HP.  ""Limited"" trim is a plus.  Engines are reliable, transmissions are at least average or better (timely maintenance, aka fluid changes, is key).  

Biggest trouble spot is the PTU (""Power Take-off Unit,"" aka transfer case) for the AWD.  It's not inherently bad, but despite Ford's recommendation that it's a ""sealed"" unit with ""lifetime"" lubrication, it needs its gear oil changed every 40-60,000 miles.  (That actually applies to all recent AWD fords with transverse engines.  *See YouTuber [FordTechMakULoko](https://www.youtube.com/user/FordTechMakuloco) for what's up with [the PTUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqq792O9-ds).)"

Naturally, I was die-hard MaNUaL-OnLY!!!11! for more years than that, but by the time I was 30, having been through a number of beaters bought for $200 to $2,000 during sometimes-hard times when I needed a car that moved under its own power more than I needed a car that I liked, I had long gotten over myself.

Manual or automatic, either type of car does the same basic task  as the other.

I've long concluded that as long as the engine is powerful enough (generally 2 liters or more of displacement), an automatic isn't much of a hinderance to the bare minimum performance metric of simply being able to merge onto a freeway at a semi-reasonable velocity.

Give the kid time.  He'll come around.  He has no choice anyway.  Manuals are like 1/4th as common in these times as 20-30 years ago when I had the same attitude."
