I got this Kane figure about a year ago but at the time i couldn't find any info on google, only 1 result from Walmart with nothing but a price. I recently discovered the series was called 'true moves' and it's most likely the same Kane from the series but the package is different. The true moves line has a very thin window box so you can only see his face and chest but this package has a wider window and no series markings.

Is it a rare packaging or something? I called a lot of toy stores here to purchase 1 for display and 1 to keep boxed because it looks unusual but only 1 store in the country had it so i nabbed it.

edit: this is the recent packaging [https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/6WYAAOSwjmhelesw/s-l640.jpg](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/6WYAAOSwjmhelesw/s-l640.jpg)"

exchristian,fo8ihei,t3_g64wv4,1587597201.0,"> What was the proverbial straw?

We had a no-contact rule; cut off everyone who leaves, even it's your own flesh & blood. That rule destroyed families & even caused suicides, my family specifically was hit hard by that rule. Minister even cut his own mother off (and family) because some crusty old 'profit' told him to. You think the minister cut off his kids after leaving? Absolutely not. I guess the rules don't apply to them.   

&#x200B;

>What did it end up costing you? What did you leave behind?

Cost me everything basically. My social life was the church, all my friends & family were there. I was an original member from the beginning & spent 20+ years growing up in it. I've seen it all- blackmail, gossip, embarrassment, innocent lies, framing, you name it. I was the last family member to leave, i stayed back a few weeks just to see what they had to say & they literally bashed my family in front of the church & called them demons. I just walked out and never looked back, it's lonely but it's better than being among those maniacs.   

&#x200B;

>Advice on how to walk away in a positive way without burning bridges?

I'd say just walk away, don't burn bridges & don't try to convince them to see the truth because it's easier to have a conversation with a coconut than to convince them. Some might listen \[if you're lucky\] or they'll either spread rumors about you & call you crazy. That's a personal choice though.

Feel free to ask me anything. I can write a book on it because it's soo much information but i don't think anyone will care enough to listen. So far i've tried reaching out but no one really seems to want to talk so i kinda suppress it. I hope i find people soon."
