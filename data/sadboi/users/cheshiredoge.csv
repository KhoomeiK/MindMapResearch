Here's how I did it. I set up some routines to make sure I always get the basics (food, sleep, hygiene, exercise) done. For example, once i wake up, i brush my teeth, and then i eat a breakfast of oats and banana and egg. Same deal every day. I kept pushing myself to do this, no matter what time i woke up, how shitty i felt, or if i had missed the day before. Just keep chugging along. As for sleep, once I got the breakfast routine down, I starting working on getting a regular sleep schedule. And once that was mostly done, I worked on going for a short walk every night. Just keep building yourself up, and slowly you'll find life is a lot easier to deal with :) and your cognitive capabilities do comr back, I oromise.

I think I stay thin by listening to my body. What I mean by that is to only eat when I'm hungry and stop eating when I'm full. It seems simple, but people don't realise how many external pressures affect their diet.

For example, people have set meal times like breakfast, lunch and dinner, and even if they dont feel hungry they just eat ""because its lunchtime"". Or ""because i'll be hungry later, i'll eat now"", or ""because i should eat with my friends"", etc. Well I just screw it and dont eat if I'm not hungry. I don't fear getting hungry later, either, cus I can have a snack, or just deal with the hunger until dinnertime. It's not a big deal to be hungry for a few hours.

Another thing is portion size. If there's too much food and I'm full, I'll pack the leftovers for later.

Also, a balanced diet. This counts as listening to my body, because I actually feel weird or unhappy if I don't get my veggies, protein, carbs. There is wiggle room, of course, like for lunch I'll have a ton of pizza, and dinner i'll focus more on fruits to compensate.

Drink water when you're thirsty, sweet drinks are okay but only once in a while. (To be honest I don't get the urge to drink them often anyway.) I never follow diets or count calories.

And exercise to stay healthy. Not necessary if you walk regularly imo."
