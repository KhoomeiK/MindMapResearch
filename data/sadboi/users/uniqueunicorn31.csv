Current routine is to wash with Not Your Mother‚Äôs  Curl Talk shampoo, squish to condish with the Curl Talk conditioner, squeeze out water with a microfiber towel, apply Aussie Instant Freeze gel to create a cast, plop in a t-shirt until mostly dry, then diffuse the rest of the way dry, scrunch in Aussie Instant Freeze mousse and scrunch out the crunch.

The most interesting to me was the daughter of swords being a ‚Äúcontributing factor‚Äù card. I noticed this person immediately because I think they are gorgeous, but observed them carefully for weeks before making a move. 

I also have been feeling that things are going almost eerily well for me lately and noticed that others seem more drawn to me when I am doing well and feeling positive.
