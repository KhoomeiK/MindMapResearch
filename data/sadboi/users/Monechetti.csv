Priest and Rogue both have insane amounts of card advantage and generation between Thoughtsteal and Burglary type effects, lackeys and other discover cards.

One thing I've noticed is getting my o-ring blown out round 1 and 2 by insane decks, and then when I considered resigning, just playing through and ending up with 6+ wins. This has happened so many times (upwards of 15 runs) that I feel like it's a thing.
