Also, pulling someone in to your hobbies and making it a group thing also has a special way of keeping you accountable.

investing,fahwmex,t3_e9amda,1576095018.0,"Mind you, take whatever I say with a grain of salt. If you’re looking to not touch your investments and let them grow, and can live without ever touching that money for the next 20-30 years, open up a Roth IRA. Basically you pay taxes on whatever you invest in now (which will be a low tax bracket since I’m guessing you make almost no money being 17). Invest in an index fund, make contributions to it as often as you can (it caps off at 5,500$ a year), and ride the market out. You’ll be making about 7% on your investments over the long run ( That’s how much the S&P 500 has yielded over like 30 years I believe). I’d stay away from individual stocks unless you’re willing to do your hw on them, stay away from bonds because the return is not that great, and since you’re so young you can afford a little risk. If you rather have access to your money now rather than later, use a brokerage account but you’ll get taxed on what you out in and your gains the moment you take them out (although you can write off losses on your taxes). 

TLDR: invest in a Roth IRA if you’re willing to sit on those investments for the better part of 40 years. Keep putting in money to it. Invest in an index fund and ride out the market. Don’t pull your money out if the market dips, be patient and just wait it out. If you don’t want to wait 40 years, use a regular brokerage account but miss out on the tax breaks."

I believe he got his black belt from Caio Terra (one of the most technical BJJ competitors, in my opinion) so that’ll give you an idea of how good his classes might be. 

I would also check out Marcio Andre Jiu Jitsu academy. This one is a new one, the facility seems pretty modern. Marcio is a hell of a grappler, killed it as a brown belt and has done pretty great as a black belt too. He’s competed against some of the most revered name in the sport and his game is pretty well rounded. I’d suggest checking his school out if you get a chance!

Spazzing is the BJJ version of like “fuck, I’m in someone’s guard/Side-control/any bad position, let me move my body super rapidly to see if I can get out, ya worth a shot”.

bjj,ewu9830,t3_cq6lzg,1565770298.0,"Focus heavily on your breathing. I’m merely assuming here so bare with me. You’re most likely muscling your way through submissions, escapes, passes, etc. What I assume is happening is that you’re exploding 100% of the time instead of exploding when necessary, which should be during opportunistic windows through out the roll. Anyways, use less strength, focus on having a solid base and not spazzing and then most importantly, breathe. These things come with time, so don’t sweat it. Fainting usually means you’re not getting enough oxygen  into your brain which one can safely assume is from not breathing throughout your rolls and going 100% all the time. Good luck !"

My advice is to do some research as to what certs would be useful to have and see if the COOL program has any of them. Still log your hours to USMAP as it doesn’t hurt and it takes very little effort to keep up with it, plus it’s something you can put on an Eval come Pro Con season.
