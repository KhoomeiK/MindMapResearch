Uthred is miserably ill while on the road to his brother and recovers as soon as Brida blocks Skade.  Brida is unable to get pregnant until she kills Storri.  The curse is not considered real by the Christians, but even they recognize something is wrong with Skade.   Alfred goes as far as asking Skade how long he has, so he acknowledges that she must have some capabilities -- regardless of how much he believes it.

The pagan beliefs are given much more credence than Christianity in the show. For example, Iseult spends all night trying to save Edward and when Beocca sees it, he says, ""Praise God.""  But it is seen as a throwaway line because Uthred is visibly frustrated that the Christian God gets so much credit when it's Iseult who spent all night in the mud with him.  This happens over and over again in the series."

I'm a navy brat with 4 military brothers myself so I am deeply rooted in the military, even as a civilian.  I guess part of the reason I give Alfred a pass is because his motivation makes sense to me.  He and Uthred play off of one another beautifully.  I don't think either one of them are perfect, by any means.  Alfred is an incredibly complex character.  He and Uthred both respect and hate each other.  They both recognize their need for each other and both are too prideful to admit it.   As Uthred said, they were bound together.  I do feel that part of the reason Alfred is maligned so much in the show is the way he is portrayed.  Bernard Cornwell is a staunch atheist and his hatred for organized religion, particularly Christianity, is clear in his writing.  As such, it automatically maligns most of the Christians and makes them look less reasonable and more hypocritical than the Danes.   It's a biased view of Alfred and Alfred's treatment of a fictitious character, so I view him with more kindness?"
TheLastKingdom,fr3b1ti,t1_fr32yaw,1589853583.0,"Uthred was given land, a wife, and a position as an eldorman of Wessex. Yes, there was a debt, but everyone (including Beocca) knew about the debt.  Uthred responded by raiding and eventually killing a Christian king whom he agreed to help in addition to other innocent people.  He is rightfully sentenced to death after this and then the swamp happens.  

In Season 2, Uthred is asked to retrieve Guthred by Beocca, his dear friend.  He goes.  Guthred is a damn coward and sells Uthred.  It is Alfred who sends Hild and Ragnar to find him.   They do.  But on the way back, he wants to get Gisela.  And he kills another man, unarmed in a church to get to her.   Uthred is given two choices, rather than being immediately put to death, which would be 100% justified.  Ragnar was responsible for Uthred.  Uthred, not wanting his brother to be punished for his own actions agrees to serve Alfred.

Uthred was told to get rid of Erik and Seigfried.  He just threatens them and they inevitably come back.   

Uthred then skulks off into dane land and is rightly questioned about it. 

Uthred straight up threatens the king -- a crime which to this day would be considered treason.  And...Alfred not only ends up pardoning him.  He also does not force Uthred to stay for Edward or to be his oathman.  Uthred chooses to stay on his own volition and chooses to serve Alfred's children long after Alfred passes.  

Considering how many decisions that Uthred made that should have resulted in his death, it's incredible that Alfred granted him as many chances as he did.  He was right to not trust Uthred because Uthred while Uthred was a valuable soldier, he had a volatile temper.   Alfred clearly trusts Uthred, but Uthred is a loose cannon.   How would you treat him?  Alfred does take advantage of Uthred's abilities, but Uthred also knows a connection with Alfred (and his family) will help him achieve what he has always wanted.   Uthred wants Bebbanburg.  Alfred wanted a united England.  Uthred is currently raising the first king of England as per history and Aethelstan's title page.   The country of England includes Wessex, Mercia.. all the way to Bebbanburg.  Fill in the blanks for what that means for Uthred.   Why was it a bad idea again? 

This is why people should watch the show more than once because they generally change their minds or see a different perspective.  I didn't like Alfred the first time through.   Third time?  He was one of my top five fave characters.

Also.. when the slavers who killed Halig and Skade exist, it's truly astounding that Alfred is  being discussed as potentially evil..."

hiking,fqxn4eq,t1_fqxgd1h,1589734865.0,"Honestly, I've never had an issue.  Use common sense.  Black bears are generally shy, but they can be curious.  For your own peace of mind, it's worth it to carry some pepper spray in the event that a bear gets too close, but this is incredibly unlikely.  If you see a bear, don't approach it and make some noise.  The most common reason for an attack is surprise, so chat amongst yourselves while hiking so that any bears in the area will hear it.   I've been within touching distance of a black bear, though I was in a vehicle and had no interest in putting the window down to do so.  The poor thing had gotten trapped between the car and a rock ledge, but as soon as it could, it scrambled up the rock ledge up to higher ground.  Like most animals, black bears can get bolder in the pursuit of food, so if you're camping, keep food up high and away from your campsite.  Don't leave food in your tent or your car.  

For grizzlies, it's pretty much similar.  I should note that I don't hike in grizzly country without a few other people and grizzlies, generally do not attack groups.  For as big as they are, their sense of self-preservation outweighs their desire to kill humans generally.   For grizzlies, I do take bear spray and stay vigilant, but I don't really fear an attack because I'm in a group and I'm aware of my surroundings.  As with the black bears, food can be an attractant, so I don't even leave an empty wrapper in the car because they can tear the doors off with no issue.   

I've had one instance where my family was on a series of switchbacks coming down them and we heard someone yell up to us, ""There's a grizzly sow on the trail in front of you. She's heading up.""  This certainly put us on alert.  I took out the bear spray and we kept walking.  While we walked, we called out to her, ""Hey Momma,"" ""Hey bear,"" ""We're not tasty, Momma,""  etc.  We got to the end of the switchbacks without ever seeing her.   About an hour later, we were on a ferry ride and looked up on the side of a cliff.   There was momma bear in all of her glory and the cub.   If we ever got close to her on the trail, I never saw her.  

Other experiences with grizzlies have been a fair distance away, so the grizzlies have all been too focused on their own task to pay me any attention.  I certainly don't get closer.  I just snap a few pics and move on."
MakeupAddiction,fqxhaxz,t3_gl99vt,1589732299.0,"Honestly, I've shied away from Jeffree's palette because I really don't play around with color often and when I do, I prefer a smaller palette or single shadow.  Colourpop works well for me in that aspect because I can stay within a small color story where I will use everything.  

So I understand where he was coming from in wanting to create a palette that was more universal.  And yet, I was still not wowed by it.  I like the packaging cuz I'm basic and marble makes me happy, but I tend to stay away from cool tones on my skin.   I rarely do a smokey eye and when I do, I have the products I need for one.  Once again, I find myself not wanting to buy this palette because I can't justify it for the few colors I would realistically use.   By contrast, I have every single color of the Tati Beauty Textured Neutrals palette.  I absolutely love it.  It is perfect for the looks that I like to create.

As far as the rest of the collection goes, I don't like lipgloss with glitter and I purchased the Allie Glines makeup bag a while back, so I don't need a new one.   I'm sure there are plenty of people who are drooling over this palette, but I'm not one of them.  Next time, perhaps."

Shihtzu,fqqa2u3,t3_gjsk4y,1589561965.0,"These are the questions that I ask every breeder.  Keep in mind that some of them are more crucial than others. 

Do you have health tests and health guarantees? This is a non-negotiable.  You need to know your dog's health history.  If the breeder is not willing to stand behind their dogs' health, run!  This is more important than AKC registration, which is nice to have but not crucial if you're not breeding.  Even backyard breeders with unhealthy dogs can get AKC registration if the dogs are purebred.  Though, if the parents have been shown and placed with the AKC, it's more relevant.

Do you have parents on sight and can I meet them?

Do you puppies live in your house or in a kennel?  
How have they been socialized?  

Do you have a contract?  A good breeder will because they want to know more about you before handing their dogs over.   They will take the dog back at any time and find it a suitable home, if you are unable to do so.  

Do your puppies live in a smoke-free home? 

Do you begin potty training the puppies?

What are you feeding the puppies?  

What do you provide with the puppies?  

Will you be available for questions as my puppy grows up?  <-- the answer should be yes. 

For Shih Tzus, avoid any breeder who markets imperials or miniature Shih Tzus.  These Shih Tzus are below breed standard and implies an  irresponsible breeder.

How many breeds do they focus on?  If they have more than one or possibly two, this is a red flag.  It makes it difficult to give the care and consideration needed to ensure each dog has what they need and are of standard.  

A good breeder will answer these questions enthusiastically and has a desire to uphold breed integrity.   They will be involved in each stage of the process and will know each puppy; therefore, they will know which puppy will suit you.  If there are a bunch of puppies available, this is a red flag.  Usually reputable breeders have a waiting list or maybe only one or two slots open.  I saw a woman who had 45 puppies available of different breeds.  Stay away.   

Honestly, go with your gut.  There are breeders who will have everything you're looking for on paper and they can be rude to you or not want to answer your questions.   Don't get sucked in by cute Tzu faces.  You want to make the right choice for your family, not which puppy make be the cutest.

And I can't speak to their intentions, tone, or your perception of it, but I don't see either of those things as a sacrifice or a betrayal.  On the first instance, you admitted that the group was no longer functioning efficiently and your INFJ friend brought this up to you.  Again, that's not sacrifice.  That's being honest.  She left.  And I don't know the situation, but the others may have felt the same and didn't know how to tell you.  That likely wasn't a personal attack, given my own view as an INFJ,  but we can be blunt and this can surprise people who view us as empathetic flower children all the time.  

In terms of the second instance, what were you expecting?  She was supportive of your writing, until you wrote something that she disagreed with based on her personal beliefs.  Again, I can't speak to how far she went with her personal attacks, but if she disagreed, how was she supposed to react?  This may not have been the case with her, but I can debate beliefs without feeling any malice against the person who holds them.   It may have been another instance where the behavior shocked you, but an honest friend who may hurt your feelings is more valuable than one who lies to spare them.

As far as gossiping goes, I wouldn't consider it an INFJ trait.  That said, I do like to read the room and notice people because it gives me information on how to interact with them. We can dwell on this too and try to plan out what can happen in personal interactions.  We like to stay ahead.  People can say all sorts of things with their body language, style of dress, etc.   In different circles, I react differently.  And so does everyone else.  This is not an exclusive INFJ quality.  I will say though that if I felt like you were guarded around me, I would naturally respond in turn.  We are naturally guarded anyway, so you putting on a mask is not going to make an INFJ feel ""safe"" to be vulnerable around you.  It takes time for us to develop lasting relationships.  Just be your authentic self around an INFJ and don't be surprised if it takes a while for them to warm up to you.   Believe me, we have analyzed the situation more than you have.  So just let it play out.  Healthy people of any type are capable of forming lasting relationships and deep connections. 

I tend not to waste my time with having lots of platonic friends.  I want deep, meaningful conversations with people who add value to my life.  Period.  I don't care what type they are.  One of the flaws I think the MBTI system has is that people tend to focus too much on their differences with others and therefore imagine conflict or a wall before one even exists.  Be who you are and see what happens.  And stay away from gossips, regardless of how they type.  Good luck!"

Tangled,fq9x13h,t3_ghhvxh,1589208710.0,"It's not really that unpopular.  Tangled follows the classic fairy tale archetype (because it is one).  There's a reason why Disney uses that formula over and over again without too much deviation from the original content.  It works.  And it works incredibly well.  

I don't hate Frozen.  In fact, I enjoy the songs and the visuals are stunning.  The characters, however,  are rather weak.  I wish they would have made Elsa the villian as originally planned because that would have made the story stronger.  In its current form, Anna is easily the better character overall even given her own life in the first film, but continuously gets overshadowed by Elsa's sparkly dresses and ice powers.  Without those qualities, Elsa is not particularly interesting.  Her sister is brave, funny, quirky, awkward, vulnerable -- everything that makes a good heroine.  And yet, Elsa is the favorite because she is more marketable...and became even more marketable in the second film whilst poor Anna gets more responsibility shoved on to her.   Kristoff could have been absent from the second film and I dont think people would have noticed.   The second film is very on the nose with its message too.  So much so that the message supercedes the story.   This is a problem in the first film too, but it's a little harder to recognize.  

Tangled just checks off all of the boxes in terms of a good story.   Mother Gothel is a scarier and more compelling villian than surprise villian Hans.  Anyone who watched GOT can say enthusiastically that shock value is not the same as a good story.   The side characters in Tangled, to me, are more entertaining, including the pub thugs.  Sven didn't need to be given ""a voice"" as it clear with Pascal and Max that their expressions can communicate things completely.  Olaf has some funny lines, but he doesn't really add much to the story and it's clear he is also in there for marketing. Eugene is a thieving rogue in the beginning who is only out for himself and by the end of the story, he is willing to sacrifice his own life to save Rapunzel. Kristoff still sells ice, i think.  I realize that Frozen is more focused in the two sisters, but I still really feel bad that that dude had virtually no role.  The first Frozen film, Elsa learns not to shut herself away from her loved ones.  In the second film?  BYE ANNA, I'm going to be a sparkly ice fairy now.  You can rule for me, right?  K, thanks.  You're the best.  Another thing that I found concerning is Anna's dependency...It was first on a man she just met and in the second film, it was as though her ENTIRE purpose was Elsa.   I know that's not what was meant by it, but it certainly seemed like it.  Shoot, she couldn't even get proposed to without Elsa partially sharing in the moment.  

Rapunzel was already a resourceful and strong character before she left the tower.   She was merely naive to the world around her because of Gothel's, but she still desired a life beyond the tower.  Once she figured out Gothel was lying, she rebelled.   She was willing to fight and save her own self.  She was kind, brave, artistic, and smart.   She's what they should have done with Anna (again, if they had kept Elsa the villian).  

I think both are good, but to me, Tangled is a far stronger story on its own even without the series."
