Whenever I tell others about my dad putting his emotions onto me I hear a lot of “that’s not normal” so I know it’s not. It’s just hard still. 

What I definitely can do is set boundaries. That’s something that I’ve been working on for a long time and nows a good time for me to set another. Until the quarantine is over we can’t hang out. Thank you"

relationships,foiywtj,t1_foiew1d,1587801864.0,"I’m sorry about what happened to you :( I think what bothers me most about cheating is the lying. If you’re not feeling like monogamy is working for you, why not just say it? Talk to your partner. It sounds scary sure, but it’s better than cheating on them and destroying their trust. I guess it comes from a place of self preservation. I’m with someone who I want to stay with for a long time right now, and I’m lucky to trust him. I don’t think he would ever cheat on me. And even though he’s a very committed and monogamous man, I made it clear at the beginning of our relationship that if he ever felt like monogamy wasn’t working for him, but he wanted to continue the relationship, I would be happy to talk about it. I think if you can find a partner you can talk to openly about your fears and work something out together you’ll definitely be able to find someone to settle down with. It’s just... scary as hell haha"
relationship_advice,foiyj94,t1_foha6ek,1587801472.0,"Is this supposed to be worse than him stopping at 10? Because it’s not. I’m a girl and when I was 15 I looked up porn of girls that were 15 because I was 15. A lot of people did. I also started watching hentai a long time ago, which is also normal. At the age where he was finally able to develop cognitions of morality, he thought “hey... I think this girl is supposed to be a child. I don’t like that.” Just like any other normal person would do. Don’t make masturbation so gross. It’s not gross"
relationship_advice,fogw2to,t3_g7d2no,1587757618.0,"If you’re so appalled by something he did a decade ago, before fully developing even basic cognitions of “morality,” honestly... take some time to grow yourself. He doesn’t deserve to be treated badly in any capacity for what he did. And who cares if he watches regular porn now. Masturbation is healthy in a relationship."
relationships,fofe5qt,t1_fofa1ss,1587733840.0,"I wouldn’t downvote you for your comment, human nature is what it is. You were unhappy in your relationship, and from what you said he seemed abusive. It’s very hard to leave abusive relationships, and I can see cheating being an effect. I’m sorry to hear that you went through that. I find it encouraging to hear that a different, healthier relationship led you to not desire to cheat. Maybe all it takes is love and security. Thank you for a unique point of view:)"
relationships,fofdt9p,t1_fof5zhn,1587733604.0,"Interesting. I’ve always been comfortable with the idea of open, honest relationships. I believe that as longed for monogamy is in this world, as humans we find ourselves beating ourselves up over non monogamous thoughts and ideas. We find love for our partners but still want to experience the newness and excitement of someone new. I think this is much more normal than we portray. I also believe that having an open dialogue about it with your partner is important for a healthy relationship. Personally, once I’m with a partner I have no interest in anyone else. I think that’s just how my brains works. I know that everyone’s different, though. I was hoping for a separate view, and I’m glad I got one. Thank you"
relationships,fof5mx9,t1_fof53v8,1587726874.0,"I believe that everyone weighs their relationships differently. I can exist happily without a romantic relationship, but I’m very extroverted; despite being very anxious and shy I thrive with human connection. So i might weigh my relationships differently than you. I do believe nowadays that it’s a healthy balance, though. I live for me and my dreams. I’ve forgiven those who’ve cheated on me, too, and honestly see their cheating as a Mess up and just a part of them growing up. Definitely not the worst that I’ve experienced, either. I don’t think that that was the point of my post, though. I was more so curious about whether or not others feel it is inevitable in a relationship."

SuicideWatch,foeygsz,t1_focryy1,1587719294.0,"Hey, I know this is late. I used to be an intern at a CAC, everyone seen there was a minor who was sexually abused. I had to watch forensic interviews of children detailing graphic stories of what happened to them. 

The feeling of helplessness was constant for me. I would go to target and see kids with their parents and every way I turned made me sick. I couldn’t get the statistics out of my mind. One in four, one in six. Average age 11. Family.

One day, after a particularly rough FI, that had taken place years before, I had to debrief with my supervisor. She showed me the progress the girl made and how strong she had become. Her story made her stronger. The horrific large population of sexually abused children - it is disgusting to think about. I try to think of their growth. I hope this helps."

He’s been with some real showstoppers in his life, and then me, just average in every way imaginable lol. It made me pretty insecure for a while, honestly, so I understand where you’re coming from. Girls love to flirt with him despite knowing that he’s taken. The thing is though, he doesn’t flirt back. He’s happy in the relationship and would never cheat on me, I’ve come to realize over time. I asked him about why he stopped seeing this one girl a while back, and he said despite her appearance, her personality was ugly. Ugly is that girl telling your boyfriend that he’s too attractive for you. Maybe have a conversation about it and explain how you feel?"
relationship_advice,fm9yp4u,t1_fm9x5tq,1585879597.0,"Interestingly enough, before we met he’d only cum from sex a handful of times. Since I’m on birth control we don’t use condoms, so he finds sex a lot more enjoyable now, but he does still like handys and blowjobs a lot too. I’d say 50% of our intimacy comes in the form of handjobs/blowjobs. It’s really not about sexual gratification for me - I just desire intimacy and really enjoy it. I’ve also tried offering up the idea of mutual masturbation, but he says that that would make him uncomfortable. 

He works in the medical field and he drains people’s neck tubes all day from cancer surgeries. So I could imagine when he’s home from work he’s not exactly raring to go. But it doesn’t make any sense to me that hed still want to do it by himself. I’m just confused"

My conclusion so far is that we remember what was most impactful to us. I remember in elementary school a boy punched me in the stomach and the next day at lunch he told me he had a crush on me. I remember playing DDR at my friend’s house every day. But that’s all I remember before 5th grade, and all I remember from that was a hurricane destroying my home. Usually trauma has something to do with repressed memories, but I’ve really been digging and I don’t think anything happened to me in elementary. Hope my story made you feel a bit more normal"

The best suggestion I can give you is to file an ethical complaint to the licensing board that passed him in. They will prevent him from working by taking away his licensure. He could face other legal repercussions as well, just be aware of that. But as someone who wants to get into social services, it saddens me to hear he was accepted into the field.

I have a new neurologist though that I just started seeing last week.

It isn’t that he doesn’t ever do anything for me. He gets all of the water cause he knows it’s heavy. Does all the laundry/dishes when it’s a hectic week for me.

I’ve dated a person you’re describing in the past and I can assure you he is not him. I don’t really know how I feel personally about sacrificing your time and happiness for someone else. Your partner shouldn’t want you to “sacrifice” your time/happiness. Maybe that’s skewed but I just don’t really like the modern ideas of romanticism. 

Like i said though, aside from this one problem that we have, he is a great partner and person. He’s attentive, considerate, hard working, has aspirations and goals that he’s actively working towards, is emotionally competent, understands boundaries, handles anger well. I can’t really say enough good about him.

My boyfriend being an introvert got brought up, and she asked me what I considered myself to be. I said “I don’t think I’m an introvert, because I don’t get burn out from social interaction. It’s actually beneficial to me.” And after saying that she recommended me the book, stating that “introverts react the opposite to social interaction.” Which, led me to believe the book would have more to do with introverts and socializing and that needed alone time - all things that we talked about. I think I like MBTI because to at least some level, you’re going to have something in common with someone who thinks somewhat similarly to you. I really believe I’m an ambivert - I always score something like 46-54 - but that’s not really an option in the MBTI world"
mbti,evr9r7p,t1_evr9ksp,1564703863.0,Why glorify anyone? It’s ridiculous to put people in boxes imo
mbti,evr9mt4,t1_evr8cyf,1564703792.0,"I guess that does make sense. I do talk to a lot of strangers and if I weren’t more aware of the possible consequences I would probably keep in contact with a lot of them too. Which, in theory, could lead to more possibilities of cheating? Just by having a larger social circle. When i was 15 I gave an older man my phone number on my walk to work. Not in a flirtatious way, but because... I’m friendly? I learned that day that maybe none of what happened was a good idea. So that’s why I don’t really extend contact with people I don’t know very well. 

Aside from being generally less “careless,” I don’t cheat, because when I decide I want to be with someone, I simply can’t have eyes for anyone else. Even after the honeymoon phase ends. I have one person to fill that slot romantically. I’m a bit sappy. Physically, I rarely even get attracted to anyone, and my sex drive really isn’t that high."
mbti,evr7qdg,t1_evr64xy,1564702876.0,"my partner is an introvert, and I was hoping to learn more about the social boundaries that a lot of introverts generally have, and maybe more than that. Does this book go over that? Right now it just sort of feels like. Fuck extroverts. :v"
mbti,evr51rd,t1_evr4hn4,1564701771.0,Maybe I should just keep listening to the book. I just felt like I should feel bad for being extroverted but that might not entirely be the message
mbti,evr3sr7,t1_evr3mb2,1564701261.0,Well surely there are others yes? It just feels wrong to call myself an extrovert when all of these assumptions are going to be put on me that I don’t at all align with.
mbti,evr3757,t1_evr2jgq,1564701020.0,"Okay but... all I do all day is ruminate over everything. I contemplate my mistakes and what I could’ve done differently legitimately from the time I wake up to the time I fall asleep.  My s/o is incredibly introverted, but he has learned to not think about his mistakes/“what if’s” nearly as often as I do. He tells me I think too much quite often. I just find it hard to believe that I don’t do that “as much” as introverts"
mbti,evr27sm,t1_evr1w8k,1564700583.0,I guess what you’re saying is it’s more likely for extroverts to not have as many close connections because they’re more interested in many looser ones? I don’t think I agree with that feeling but it could be because of my type :x

relationship_advice,eukiu7i,t1_eukfpss,1563888927.0,"I fell out of love with my ex 2 years before leaving him. It didn’t really feel fast to me because of this, but I can see why you would feel differently. 

And yeah, he has never really discussed with me what is and isn’t okay when it comes specifically to “domming” me, I think he expected it to be the same as his last relationship. I’d like to tie this to ignorance rather than abuse. I did tell tell him we could use some toys, and that he could do stuff to me as well. I just reacted differently than I thought I would. 

When I talked to him about it afterwards, I explained aftercare and that he crossed my boundaries. He apologized and said he would act differently next time, and comforted me until we fell asleep.

He did continuously ask me if what he was doing was okay after i expressed that i was uncomfortable. I was telling him that I was comfortable. After a while, him asking me if it was okay started making me question whether or not it really was, so I told him to stop asking. 

I haven’t experienced this before, I know now that if I had to question whether or not it was okay, we should have stopped. I was just very confused about my emotions and didn’t want to give in to my past. I wanted to live in my present. 

I’m sorry if I made my boyfriend look like an abuser- he is an incredibly considerate and kind person, who genuinely cares about my happiness and wellbeing. When it came to this situation in the bedroom, I felt uncomfortable and didn’t speak up about it until after, and he didn’t discuss boundaries with me (regarding domming in specific) beforehand because he assumed from past experiences. We both kind of goofed up. 

I think I was more so just surprised with my trauma resurfacing, and how I handled it myself (by not handling it at all).

I have a general idea of what a healthy relationship looks like and how to have one. I wish you wouldn’t assume that I didn’t- that takes away years of progress that I’ve made in therapy. Maybe I’ll look more into the bdsm community, I’m sure someone has been through something similar over there"

My INTJ partner (8 months) doesn’t want to tell me he loves me yet, which is kinda crazy to me! I fall in love so quickly and not just romantically. I love to feel. Why deny myself the right because of fear? He however rarely says those words, even to his mom, much less a girlfriend. He thinks they mean less to me, but what he doesn’t understand is that I really am just that loving! A feeling I experience more than others."

I can’t help but worry about hidden agendas! I’ve been cheated on and disregarded in every relationship I’ve been in. I’m working on it but I find myself wanting to indulge in being comforted by my partner sometimes. It’s easier to be happy in a relationship when I feel confident in it. 

My partner is not very good at making me feel confident in our relationship so I have more reasons to worry. 

Ex- “I have no reason to cheat on you and I don’t want to at all. Im very happy with our relationship right now. But I can’t predict the future. I don’t want to lie to you and say I will never cheat on you, and I can’t assure you that I would tell you if it happened either. Again, that’s not to say I have any inclination of cheating. Just that I don’t want to tell you a lie.”

Simultaneously a comforting yet stressful way to say something! I wish he would just say “I am happy with where we are and I don’t want to cheat right now” instead of adding the rest of that in there, but I really do appreciate his honesty. I have a big thing against liars :x"
mbti,etivmve,t1_etiv46h,1562860802.0,I mean my initial reaction was to be offended yeah but my secondary reaction was to just look at what you said from another perspective. Although doing that is what kept me in an abusive relationship for years... giving everyone the benefit of the doubt is hard but I feel like it’s important so I do it anyway
mbti,etiv13q,t1_etiun1y,1562860431.0,Gimme the reasons! I am interested
mbti,etius7g,t1_etiun1y,1562860280.0,Tell me about it:x
mbti,etiufuu,t1_etitdyu,1562860068.0,"The man barely enjoys sex, and before me he dated some reaaaal hotties. I’m like... a 6? 7 on a good day. They were solid 9’s. He’s a titty guy and I have 0 tittie. He’s definitely had the opportunity in the past to stay with girls way more conventionally attractive than me. He even admitted to that, but he says my personality is way better than theirs was. 

I’ve considered maybe he just stays with me for the sensuality (he loves to cuddle and sleep next to someone) though. We’ve been together 8 months and he told me “I’m on my way to loving you too” which sounds like a cop out but he does move really .. really .. slowly. 

He’s had some relationships in the past where he tried going in full force lovey dovey, but they all turned out garbage, so now he’s doing he exact opposite. 

Or I could just give into my insecurities & believe you :^("
mbti,etirrpw,t1_etir0c2,1562858354.0," Thank you for the video and for your explanation! I knew I was having a hard time understanding his perspective but not why. He is understanding of my emotional POV so I can be understanding of his objective POV :) also, I’m sending him that video. lol"
