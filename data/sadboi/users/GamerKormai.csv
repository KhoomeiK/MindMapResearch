raisedbyborderlines,fqw8qd4,t3_gl4q7g,1589696119.0,"It's different for different people. For me it was terrible. For the first 5 years I would have the recurring nightmares 4-6 times per week. I finally told my psych about it and he gave me a low dose of Trazodone to help supress dreams. So I've now been taking that for almost 2 years and I only have the nightmares once every 3 weeks maybe? And they are definitely less intense.

The dreams are the same in the sense that my dad didn't die, he somehow survived. The circumstances are different in each dream. But he's back and blames me for what happened, and he's pissed. To clarify, since people like to mention this when I tell them about this dream: I do not blame myself for his stroke, but I know what he was like and I know HE would blame me if he lived.

At the time of his death 7 years ago, I was not in any kind of treatment and had no idea what CPTSD was or any of the self healing that I have done now. So I feel the nightmares wouldn't have been nearly as bad had I already been on my journey.

In his will he'd said in a situation like that to just let him go. So they gave him 48 hrs to see if he'd recover any function.

CPTSD,fn2cj0r,t3_fyw5yz,1586584359.0,"Yeah when I was 8 I asked to go to the eye doctor because I couldn't see the chalkboard. The eye doctor told my dad that I didn't need glasses and probably wanted them because other kids had them. Fast forward 3 years in grade 6 and I was literally copying the notes off the person beside me because I couldn't read the board. But I just assumed that's how everyone else saw.

We were at my brothers bowling tournament that year and my dad asked me to go find which lane he was in. I came back and said that I can't read the monitors. He grabbed my arm and dragged me closer and angrily yelled ""you can't read that!?""

So this time we went to a different eye doctor who was baffled why I didn't come sooner. Saw the first eye doctor the next year to get a new prescription and I asked her straight up, why did you tell my dad I didn't need them in grade 3!? And her excuse was ""oh you were borderline you didn't need them at the time.""

Another instance with my health was I had issues breathing while playing soccer and I wondered if I had asthma. I mentioned that to my dad, who had normal asthma and he said dismissively ""if you had asthma, you'd know."" Hey, guess what, I explained to my doctor a few years ago what happens when I exert myself and he says ""sounds like you have asthma!"" Suck it dad.

But when I was little I used to lie a lot to try to get out of trouble because that's how terrified I was of my dad. I'd have rather lied and potentially be believed and not get in trouble because I knew if I told the truth I'd definitely get punished. But I don't know which came first. The lack of credibility or the lying. My guess is the lack of credibility. Either way my family loves to bring up that I was a huge fibber as a kid. Like where did the 4 year old learn it from!??"

I also have really loved Narcos and Narcos Mexico, but if you don't speak Spanish (like me) you'll have to pay attention and read the subtitles. But they are really good."

CPTSD,fjosr18,t1_fjlkuhv,1583534091.0,"I took some time to reflect and I'm pretty sure I've figured it out.

Before stabilizing my bipolar, I had a very low tolerance for social interaction. Since finding the right meds I have a much higher capacity for social interaction or a larger ""social battery capacity"" I like to call it. But even though it's 10x what it used to be it is still far less than ""normal"" introverts. I was overwhelmed and burnt out. I have a lot of things going on right now.

What made it worse was on Tuesday I was talking to my old boss who basically implied I wasn't doing very much and should have taken on more work this semester. That what I was doing wasn't a full time job so ""what do you do all day?"" But I've tried to explain to her in the past that I am an extreme introvert but she doesn't understand.

Not caring so much about what other think or judge me for is something I need to work on.

Anyways, thanks. You got me to really think about it and I better understand my limits now. :)"

Also, I hope that in the long run the divorce was the best decision for you."
