BipolarReddit,eqsb1w1,t3_bzarc4,1560280813.0,I went off  meds for three miserable years after I was too old to be on my parents insurance. Last week I finally found a doctor to take me without insurance and then ONE of the meds I was prescribed was $935. I was so beat down after that. I finally discovered the app goodrx and it was a life saver. Literally saved me $900. Moral of the story is that the system in America not only keeps mental health at a minimal priority.. it seems as though it tries to hinder us completely from getting any kind of help. It‚Äôs hard enough to get out of bed when you deal with this illness much less fight the system just to get treatment.
