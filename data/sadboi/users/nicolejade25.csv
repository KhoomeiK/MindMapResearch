It wasn‚Äôt ac seizure and ultimately they referred me back to my primary doctor. He said it happens because that‚Äôs the way my body deals with stress. He increased my med dosage and that helped so much.... until I was laid off from my job due to the virus. 

The body vibrations (I call them lightning strikes bc that‚Äôs what it feels like to me) ‚Äîthey happen every night again, most nights i have several strikes. 

I don‚Äôt sleep well at all bc the adrenaline that follows the strikes keeps me wide awake. I‚Äôm just dealing with it until I can go back to work. Hopefully once I‚Äôm working again they will calm down.

The story follows twenty-one year old Simon Reed and his best friend Luke as they attempt to prevent the launch of a deadly worldwide pandemic.
 
Simon‚Äôs father Oliver was a master watchmaker who had disappeared when Simon was just a young boy. Simon grew up under the care of his mother and remained angry with his missing father for years. Shortly after his twenty-first birthday, a small inconspicuous package arrived. It contained an old familiar pocket watch and a short note that read: ‚ÄúSet the hands to 3:47 and press the dial.‚Äù Simon refused and shrugged off the letter as proof of his father‚Äôs alleged lunacy. Luke, his best friend, convinced him to follow the instructions. Upon doing so, they were both immediately transported from Simon‚Äôs childhood home, into a pitch black underground cavern. 
  
While confused and shaken about their unexpected journey, they meet a man named Anton who helps to unlock the mysteries of Simon‚Äôs past. Anton and his trusted accomplices teach Simon and Luke about the history of the horror that awaits them, and the crazed scientist who started it all: Dr. Tate Pedersen. They are ushered into a hidden war that is so complex and twisted, the likes of which have not been seen since the Holocaust. Only one thing is certain...they‚Äôll never look at time the same way ever again."
