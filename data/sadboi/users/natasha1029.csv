Advice,f0vpgpa,t1_f0vclsz,1568988492.0,"Hey OP. I’m so sorry for what you went through. Just know that no one can tell you how to feel about anything. Your brother is feeling guilty and trying to manipulate the situation. This happened to me when I was younger with my older brother. However, I never confronted him or told my parents for fear of breaking up the family so I get being scared. You don’t have to do anything you don’t feel comfortable doing. Good luck with everything."
Advice,f0uogow,t3_d6ee2x,1568946194.0,"Where do you live? I can help you find local resources, even free ones that you can take advantage of! You don’t need your parents permission since you are of age and they don’t need to know that your are seeking mental health treatment. I’m in the same boat my mother thinks she was this great mom and she actually and sadly that’s far from the truth. I’ve been attending therapy and haven’t told them. It’s done wonders for me."
depression,f0mupos,t3_d5d5lq,1568753571.0,"Hi OP, you are not a hypocrite at all. Shit, I am a drug and alcohol counselor and use weed to cope everyday. It what we call imposter syndrome. Feeling like you don't belong because of certain circumstances. Don't be upset that you are depressed or having a hard time coping, you spend the majority of your day listening to people traumas its only normal to take some of that stuff home with you. Just try to self care on a daily basis, I'm sure you get this a lot but it truly helps.

Have you tried to go to therapy for yourself? do you have a plan or means of killing yourself?"

depression,exp34ah,t1_exnpazi,1566485316.0,"I don’t think anyone likes to talk about problems, but I think that’s the vulnerability part of things. Just remember that 1) you paying this person to hear your problem so don’t feel bad. 2) client confidentiality no one in the world needs to know what is been discussed or that you’re even attending therapy. It’s your journey and you get to share that or not. Also one thing to Keep in mind that you have control of session. You get to decide which doors you want to open and which ones will stay close. I have been Going to therapy for a year and there still traumas I haven’t spoken  to my therapists about because I’m not ready yet. A good therapist will respect that, also don’t feel bad to shop around for a therapist. It took me three therapist to finally find a good one I vibe with. That’s a really important part because If you don’t vibe well like your views or ethics are total opposite that might be difficult for her or him to understand you. Good luck in your journey, remember to redefine success, you just talking about how scary therapy is a a success. You thinking about going his a success. You showing up to sessions is a success. Baby steps, dont look for instant gratification, it takes time! 
Also, the most common problem I come across is that people say “I’m on anti depressants and they are not helping”. Well not because it’s not a magical pill, if we expect us to change by just a pop of medication we got it wrong. Anti depressants helps us either make more of a neural transmitters or less of it in order for us to feel a little better enough to get to therapy once in therapy we are able to talk about whatever is bothering us (because the pill) this helps us with our thoughts and feelings and emotions. Maybe this time around you can try both. 

Thanks that’s very kind of you! Yes sadly we do live among people who want to do harm."
depression,exmkuit,t1_exlskth,1566434096.0,"of course i dont mind at all. EMDR is a really intense therapeutic modality and its not recommended for someone new to therapy. Usually this person has been working on healing and has experience in therapy. the therapist uses whats called a lateral eye movement, either moving their hand back and forth and client follows with just eye moment or they have a light that they follow from left to right. This helps the client access their traumatic memory by triggering a network in the brain. think of like a guided meditation where it almost feel out of body. Here the therapist follows the client through the traumatic experience and help him or her to eliminate any emotional distress attached to that specific event and develop new cognitive emotions. 

CBT on the other hand is cognitive behavioral therapy is a common type of talk therapy. It is usually structured with certain number of  sessions and there are concrete goals you want to work on. i don want you to think that therapy is this magical thing that can fix anything, if you work hard and do your homework it will work and you will see a change in your thought process. CBT focus on cognitive distortions which is explains that thoughts triggers emotions and emotions trigger actions. Therapist in this modality help you catch all the distortions in our thoughts so that we can better manage our emotions and actions.... hopes this help! let me know f you have any other questions."

Hi OP, first off thank you for sharing and for being vulnerabel with us. Question, what kind of therapy did you try? im just curios becuase some modalities just dont fit all people. 

I have been wokring with survivors of human trafficking for a few year and we use whats called EMDR, Eye Movement DesensitiZation and Reprocessing therapy. its an interactice psychotherapy technique used to relieve psycholopgical stress. Its use as an effective treatment for trauma and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This type of modalite has changed the lives of a lot of trafficking victims in our program. You may not feel up for it but just keep it in mind. I read in the comments that you are not willing to take medication, thats perfectly fine i actually agree. I do normal talk CBT therapy with no medication and i find it very helpful. I have these kinds of days where my day is just me on my bed for 12 hours watching useless tv. EMDR helps us rewrite the story we tell ourselve inside our head. Good luck! please keep us update on your progress even if that mean going outside to take in the sun. keep on pushing!"

AskMen,ewpts0i,t1_ewp2crm,1565649139.0,"as a female, I learned by watching that men are not supposed to express pain, sadness or any other emotion that's not tough or manly. its sad that society perpetuates this type of thinking because just like women, men have feelings too. Now as a female that's friends with men I have learned how to navigate this is little better. I tend to hang with my guy friends on a one to one basis where I can make the space feel safe and unjudgmental, usually involving weed ;)  but I have seen that my guy friends open up when there are no other men that can potentially put them down or laugh for expressing there feelings. Im sorry to hear that your mom passes and you felt alone in the process, that's unfair to you. I hope that you will be able to express these feelings to your friends so they know how to best approach you when these situations happen. like a lot of people have said people don't deal well been uncomfortable so they tend to ask the easy questions. let them know what you need so they can support you in the way you need supporting."

Not sure why? maybe because you don't want to believe that his some of his comments are racist. Highly unlikely yes, is it possible of course.
