Coronavirus,fqrf34s,t3_gkizc5,1589583097.0,"The Quebec company Medicago, which developed a vaccine against COVID-19, announced today that it has obtained very encouraging results in animals. Building on this first success, it plans to launch clinical trials in healthy people this summer.

Researchers at this biopharmaceutical company administered a first dose of this vaccine to mice in order to verify its safety and its ability to induce a good immune response. They then proceeded to take blood samples from the animals, ten days after having vaccinated them. Analysis of these blood samples revealed that ""the vaccine has boosted the production of a good level of antibodies. Depending on the dose and formulation administered, the antibody level was 100 to 10,000 times higher than before vaccination, ""said Nathalie Charland, senior director of scientific and medical affairs at Medicago.

Some animals received the vaccine alone, while others were given the vaccine combined with an adjuvant, an immunostimulator intended to enhance the immune response. “Many childhood vaccines, including the HPV vaccine, contain adjuvants. Adding an adjuvant may reduce the effective dose, that is, the dose of [antigen] vaccine needed to induce a good immune response. This would make it possible to produce more doses with the same amount of vaccine [antigens] and thus to vaccinate more people. The adjuvant can also provide a faster immune response, extend the protection that the vaccine provides, or even avoid the need for a booster dose, ""said Charland.


Precisely, the mice which were vaccinated several weeks ago received a booster a few days ago. We will check in a few weeks whether the latter has increased the immune response or not. ""It’s common to give a booster shot to protect against a new virus you’ve never had before. Young children often need more than one dose of vaccine, since they have never been exposed to the viruses and bacteria in circulation. For example, adults only get a single dose of the flu vaccine, while children under the age of six months often need a second dose to produce a good level of antibodies to the virus, ”says Ms. Charland."

Water alone won't remove much of the germs on our hands because water and oil don't like each other, so they won't mix. But soap likes both water and oil. That's because soap molecules are a type of surfactant, which means they have one end that's water loving, or hydrophilic, and one end that's oil loving, or hydrophobic. 

When you wash your hands with soap, the soap molecules act as a mediator between the water and oil molecules, and bind with both of them at the same time. Then when you rinse everything off, the soap carries away the germs with the water."
