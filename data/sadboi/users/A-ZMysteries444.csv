So, in a love marriage if it’s not working out, you divorce and go your separate ways and that’s that.

But, in an arranged marriage, if things are not working out, you stay because it’s what Allah wants and you were married based off of your elder’s phenomenal judgement. The rates of people staying in a toxic relationship are higher here because of course a religious marriage cannot be cut off as easily.

Of course though, caliph won’t explain this part of it."

It just doesn’t make sense. I think that girls especially should be educated about this stuff so as to prevent being taken advantage of by their husbands later on. It’s just... SO damn taboo that all of these conversations are shut down completely. How did my mom expect me to know what to expect once married?

islam_ahmadiyya,fmusxmj,t1_fmus0yw,1586398179.0,"Hey that’s pretty cool, I’m looking to be in the medical career too. 

And yes, what is horrible is that Ahmadi women (all Muslim women for that matter) will always feel a certain guilt while building their career because they are told they should sit at home raising their kids. My mom probably feels this to some extent too as she loves being a teacher but watching me loose faith probably makes her feel as though her having a career is at fault. 

What amazes me is the amount of people who find following a book and the sayings of a prophet written 1400 years ago is somehow perfectly normal and sane. The world is changing. It’s always going to be changing. So treating something written so long ago as if it is set in stone is concerning and honestly a little absurd if you think about it.

I hope to leave too but of course that is going to be immensely difficult. It breaks my heart to think of how my mother may see herself to have failed in raising me. Or the thought of her feeling shame at the mosque for the fact that her eldest daughter left. But in the end I have to work on remembering that I can’t continue  spending my entire life pretending to be something I’m not."
islam_ahmadiyya,fmul1ya,t3_fxg04f,1586393498.0,"Wow. This was amazing. She really painted the whole picture of Ahmadiyyat perfectly and truthfully. When you have it all compiled like this, it becomes even clearer that this is not the place for me! It’s oppressive and strict and no matter how they advertise it, it’s always gonna be like this.

A couple of months ago I went to a Lajna meeting with my mom and the topic, of course, was purdah. My mom got it in her head that if she told the ladies there that I wasn’t observing purdah and covering my head, I’d feel more pressured to do so. She told them and everyone put on a big show of how they weren’t judging me in the slightest. But we all know the truth. They probably all went home that day and gossiped about me. After the meeting the Sadr pulled me into another room.

She said that of course no one was judging me and that I shouldn’t be angry with my mom. But she did say with huge emphasis, “You’ve just got to remember to do what *makes Allah happy.*” 

This just goes to show how much pressure is put on us to cover up and be ashamed. Whenever I go out with a shirt and simple cardigan my mother looks at me with this certain disapproval and almost disgust in her eyes and then passes a comment on how “my chest is too prominent” and that I should act like a “good Ahmadi girl” and cover up. It’s just all so oppressive and makes you feel shame for the most natural things. 

I need to *leave*"

islam_ahmadiyya,fmpqkdv,t1_fmoiidr,1586285534.0,"I’m 16.

I hate having to fake pray and everything. I know I’m living a lie and it breaks my heart every single day. But the thing is, it really is her house and I’m her kid. I can’t do anything because I’m her responsibility right now. My little sister is her child and I guess she has a right to raise her as she wants. I just hope my sister isn’t completely brainwashed too. I can’t fight her on this because she is stubborn and it will only cause a huge fight and the house will be toxic (and since the whole quarantine thing is happening, a toxic house environment is something I’d like to avoid). 

I tried to tell her that I hate praying because I don’t feel any of it. She said that if I loved her, I would continue praying in order to please Allah. If I don’t believe in Allah then why the heck should I pleasing him? Whatever, she simply doesn’t see reason.

And I did bring up the face that if she was raised Christian then she would believe in Jesus and the Christian God. She kinda just dismissed that and I don’t remember exactly how she responded because she *didn’t have a good answer* 

I’ve basically given up as of now. I’m forced to sit down every Friday and waste an hour of my day listening to Huzoor’s sermon. I pray. I don’t cover my head because that is where I draw the line and I refuse to let her make me and she has kinda given up at this point. I’m hoping I have the courage to leave the Jama’at when I turn 18. I hope I don’t succumb to my fear of ceasing to be something I’ve been my whole life. 

I don’t know what’s gonna happen in my future. The uncertainty is scary. It’s been drilled into my head for the past 16 years that marriage is the ultimate goal and the only way I’ll be successful. I don’t know who I’m gonna marry or if I’ll even find someone since I’m not gonna be in the Jama’at. I have to work on making this not my main focus. My main focus needs to be building my career. It’s just hard to unravel something that has been beat into my brain for my whole life. 

But thank you so much for the support. Thank you for assuring me that I’m not in the wrong! I’m gonna try. I’ve just got to get through these two years and then I’ll work on breaking free. Let’s just hope my parents don’t follow me to college :/"
islam_ahmadiyya,fmoe262,t3_fa6svx,1586255587.0,"I told my mom about my doubts a few years ago. She basically dismissed me as I was still very young. I brought it up again a few weeks ago because she was yelling at me for neglecting namaz. I told her I simply didn't believe anymore and that many aspects of this religion didn't settle right with me.

&#x200B;

Dude. She told me to study it. She said while I lived in her house I had to pray and everything so as not to corrupt my little sister's perspective. That part I understand. But she told me to study the stuff on alislam. She said if I loved her, I would continue researching and studying Ahmadiyyat and that hopefully ""Allah would guide me back onto the right path."" 

&#x200B;

I then asked what she would do if I actually left.

&#x200B;

""Would you still love me?"" I asked. 

&#x200B;

She said she couldn't answer that. She told me not to think about the future and that all I should do is keep ""studying."" Grrr it was so frustrating! She thinks that if I simply pay closer attention to the Friday Sermons or something, I'll magically believe again. I've tried for her sake. It breaks my heart imagining how disappointed in her self she must feel. I finally gave in and assured her I would continue praying while I still lived with her and that I would continue researching. I don't know what's gonna happen. I just hope I don't come out on the other side with a mother who hates me and a family that has disowned me. All I know is that I have to leave. I have to leave because I don't want to feel guilty for not covering my head. I want freedom, and Ahmadiyyat hasn't proven to be the place to find it."
