I posted a picture to show my progress, that‚Äôs what my fitness account is for. Well it was until I deleted all socials. I posted before and after pics and things like that. Nobody commented on any of my other pics and i don‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs for me to look back on, not them. You can call it seeking validation but you clearly aren‚Äôt the one who‚Äôs educated because there is a difference between begging for attention and sharing an achievement. Accutane is rough and it took a lot of strength to get through it. Thanks."
Accutane,fp9rj0d,t1_fo47ewb,1588433039.0,"hey! Thank you for taking the time to comment, I respect your views and I hope you can respect mine. I understand that you may see this as an attention seeking sort of post. You are acting like the people who I‚Äôm ranting about. As you can see in the last line of my post, I said ‚Äòwhy can‚Äôt people be proud?‚Äô Not ‚Äòwhy can‚Äôt people give me attention?‚Äô. I posted my accutane before and after post on my fitness Instagram account for only a few people to see and the reason I was more mad than upset was because it was filled with unnecessary hate. I have literally stated how I‚Äôm proud of myself and how I‚Äôm confident in my own skin and the rant is about the people who aren‚Äôt. Just because you are Male, it doesn‚Äôt mean you have a harder job fighting for a self esteem. Just like you‚Äôre saying to me, why do you give a shit about what people think? You clearly do care about other‚Äôs opinions because you wouldn‚Äôt be so cut off for no reason. Words hurt sometimes man, you can‚Äôt change how you really feel, you can improve though. I am a regular gym goer and I go almost everyday of the week and I have just deleted all social media apart from Reddit. The people like you who spread negativity are the reason people get upset, I‚Äôm surprised you get women with a disgusting attitude like that. You‚Äôre preaching positivity but negatively, how does that even work? Before you tell me what to do with my life, why don‚Äôt you focus on your own a bit more first since it must be so difficult..."

I am saying that he may like her for her provocative pictures but then again what do I know? It‚Äôs their relationship - not mine. Now I think of it, there were faults. He is a drug dealer and he has strange parents. I got weird vibes from his dad , he made me feel uncomfortable this one time when he asked ‚Äòare u having sex with her?‚Äô And this was all he wanted to know about me... I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs happy, I gave him all I could and put in 110% and it wasn‚Äôt good enough:( he has had sex with many girls and dumped them afterwards, which is why I was weary at first and I was right.

I can‚Äôt seem to find any faults apart from how he dumped me a day after I said I wouldn‚Äôt have sex just yet, which suggests he wanted sex because he gave me no valid reason as to leaving me. He has a past of using girls and his niceness almost attracts them in, which is what happened to me... The new girl‚Äôs only photo of her on her social media is of her in a bikini, which may suggest he is with her for a similar reason to me, but I didn‚Äôt give him what he wanted. He has been spending a lot of time with her but in complete honesty she looks nothing special. I am obsessed like psycho obsessed with him and idk what to do..."

All of a sudden with the Corona Virus I have had so much time to think. He lives 10 mins away from me and whenever I go anywhere I think of him. I truly love him a lot - he was so kind and I can‚Äôt find any faults.

I love him so much, his personality, his laugh, his smile, his scent... A scent I will never forget, a heavy musky scent, thick and endearing. He left me. He doesn‚Äôt care and he never did.
