Male, mid 20's. 

For about a month I've felt like I couldn't breathe in fully. It gets worse at night, but I wouldn't say I'm like... debilitatingly winded. 

At the beginning of the month, I had super thick, tacky, sticky green phlegm coming from the back of my throat, and it migrated to my lungs. I haven't really had a cough, but for about 2 days I did run a low grade fever, and for a couple days I did have really bad diarrhea. I've been monitoring my spo2 off and on with my samsung S10, and it's usually around 94/95, with the lowest being 89 two nights ago. 

Now, just in the past hour I suddenly feel worse. My lungs feel raw, like I just went for a long run. I am continuously breathing in deep and then hacking to try to force some of this super thick mucus out. Just a tiny bit is coming out at a time. 

The only thing that has me worried is that this just suddenly got worse. Like, I shouldn't be hacking this much, but I feel like I need to get stuff out of my lungs.

So.. should I be concerned?"

To reiterate, there was nothing you could have done. 

If you start going down the rabbit hole of ""why didn't I see it, why didn't I stop it"", you'll eat yourself alive. Soldiers want things black and white, but more importantly we want someone to blame. The easiest person to blame when it comes to a friend's suicide is yourself; you're the most convenient enemy. Particularly because the troglodytes who make mandatory suicide prevention training drill it into us that we have the power to magically sense that someone is about to kill themselves by looking at ther credit card statement and reading an ACE card. 

I had a guy I went to school with who offed himself. I wanted to know whose fault it was. I wanted justice, and I was the only person I could sentence. At first, I blamed myself, our command, the Army, the Infantry; everyone. I tortured myself, drank myself into a hole, and damn near put a bullet between my own eyes to just make it stop. Every time I failed, I felt like it was just punishment for my sins. 

It took until recently for me to recognize the truth: it's not my fault. It's not our Commander's fault. It's not the asshole 1SG's fault. It's not the Army's, or the Infantry's, or God's, or Satan's fault. 

I carried his corpse on my shoulders for years- along with the hate, the blame, the guilt- before I finally realized the only person to blame for his death was him. He made that choice. It tastes really bad in the mouth, but it takes the weight off.

Your experience was not my experience, nor was it the experience of the people I served with. My personal experience was that we were told that if we hot help, we'd get kicked out. My personal experience was company and battalion level leadership attacking Soldiers who went and got treatment for faking it. My personal experience was having to fight with my 1SG about whether or not people in my platoon who were on profile would take an APFT, because in his expert non-medical opinion they were faking it. 

My experience was Soldiers offing themselves, and leaders coming up to tell the unit that they lost a friend, and that he was weak, cowardly, and all the other things a leader should *never* tell grieving Soldiers. 

What do you expect me to do with that? Go back in time and say ""I'm going to go get checked out  and I I don't care how much it angers you, Sir!""

My guys, I tried to take care of as best I could. Sometimes that was directly fighting with leadership and sticking up for them, sometimes it was by telling them to go to the ER  and get checked out instead of their PCM, sometimes it was by having them come into the office, tell me what's wrong and shredding an APFT they shouldnt have taken. If I had a chance to continue progressing, maybe I could have had that impact over people I directly influences.

1) Doesn't really matter how pretty the area around you is if you never get to see it

2) The weather/climate is god awful. Cold as all hell, and every year there is at least one giant hailstorm that literally breaks the entire city. Getting trapped in the field in snow happens, often. Rollovers are super common, because the terrain in the TAs sucks. 

3) The training area is minuscule, so you end up either training on top of other units, in an area that doesnt actually meet the objective, or having to stab other units in the neck to get what you need. Encourages backstabbing.

4) The units aren't a shit show. They're hostile towards Soldiers. Sure, it's pretty outside. But, when its 14 degrees outside, the air is as thin as your morale, you've been in the field every week for the past 3 months, and then the unit wants to do a damn APFT with 24 hours notice, the beautiful scenery doesn't comfort you that much. The fratricidal attitude is at all levels. It gets to the point that you don't realize how much it's gotten into your soul until you go somewhere else and people are like ""Holy shit. Dude.. you need to quit being a BF.""

5) Suicide rate is crazy high. So bad, that they have one of the highest medical provider suicide rates in the army. 

6) When I was there, 4ID had the lowest first term retention rate in the Army. They could not keep junior enlisted and junior officers. The rate for people who'd been somewhere else was OK, but those dudes all seemed to reup with a PCS promised or only stay for retirement stabilization."

The only ones that are regularly removed are specifically ones critical of the Chinese government.

That's exactly the reason you, too, should be shouting from the rooftops that we need to stop using data from the Chinese government reports, because fake data *will* kill people. 

Conspiracy theories and noble intent aside, that is a perfectly valid opinion to express.

Ok, let's look at your example there. This is the equivalent of being in that survival reddit and saying ""Hey, it has been consitently proven that this source just makes this stuff up! Using anything he publishes as a reference is a bad idea, especially for a serious situation!""

Then, someone bans/removes any comments that suggest that the data that ""we all know"" is fabricated is, in fact, fabricated. Any comments saying that Mr. Grylls is a great survivalist or wishing more survival experts would follow his made up advice can stay though! 

As for the free speech thing- how does this not? The entire goal of totalitarian control of information is to quash dissenting opinion and elevate supporting opinion. The internet presents an interesting conundrum, wherein there is unlimited information, but in many cases unlimited capacity to control access to it. When these people go through and effectively cherry pick comments to remove a particular (and, I'll stress this: accurate!) interpretation, that is by definition a free speech issue. Especially considering the opposite opinion is allowed to remain.

Especially in a forum where globally people are seeking information, this is flagrantly an attempt to expose the majority of people to only one side of an argument. So, even if ""we all know it"", reading the ""official"", Reddit banner advertised page, one is encouraged to think ""hub, maybe it's not so bad, maybe China did have some good ideas hmmmm"" and not ""Oh, yeah, that's right, China is full of shit"".

So, it ends up being a global free speech issue. It's a small, select group having absolute and irrevocable control over which opinions can be expressed, not just by citizens but laddie daddie every cott-damned human being on planet earth. The mere concept of that would make every dead dictator reanimate just to get a quick wank in before going back to being dead."
