Misinformation and playing down the virus is exactly the shit which will prolong the bullshit we're having to put up with right now.

Exponential growth is exactly the kind of thing we need to avoid, and it begins by dealing with it when the numbers are this low.

If we leave it until it's too late, there will be nothing we can do about it infecting the majority of the planet's population.

What's more is that without a cure, and without guaranteed immunity for those who have already had it, we're at risk of it mutating into something much more sinister than what we're dealing with right now, with a much higher death rate.

So no, even if your maths were correct, we'd still be fucked if nobody took any notice of social distancing, self isolation and quarantine. 100,000 cases in the first 67 days turns into another 100,000 in 19 days, then ANOTHER 100,000 within 4 days after that. That's how exponential growth works. It starts off slow, but if you don't manage it when it's slow, it rapidly becomes uncontrollable.

Even if your maths were correct, you're only adding a few days to the equation. 1 case becomes 20 very quickly in this scenario.

When the guy at the back waves his arms out, the head mechanic at the front gives the same signal to the driver, presumably to say ""You're not going back out just yet, there's a problem with the car.""

It was a day of maturation for me, and a life experience that stayed with me for a long time!"

So what you're saying is Covid-19 are nanobots disguised as a virus designed to destroy the West!?

&#x200B;

They're infecting us, ensuring our populations' blood streams are teeming with nanobots designed to bring the West under the control of the Chinese!!

...or, you know, that'd be a bit more Metal Gear than it just being some guy eating a dodgy chicken of the cave."

The mental side of things is shit, and u/AngelCrawford is right: you never know what form your salvation will take.

For me, it was those wonderful pastel-coloured ponies.

Between 2012-14 I was in a huge slump. I was struggling mentally and - at times - suicidal. Then, one day in early 2012, I decided to make a chance stop off on 4chan just to remind myself that there is worse shit in the world, and the damn thing was infested with ponies.

I know what 4chan is like, especially for its ability to meme everything, so like any good 4channer, I lurked to get an idea of what it was all about, and decided to source the material.

Long story short, I ""found"" the first season, and ended up until 4am watching the hell out of it.

The hardest part was getting through the intro, sitting there cringing at myself like ""why the hell am I putting myself through this?""

But as the opening two-parter went on I realised that I was actually enjoying it. It was genuinely picking me up from the cold, dark headspace I was in.

Over the course of the next few weeks, I watched everything that was out at the time (the second half of season 2 was still airing).

I became ""obsessed"" and started buying merchandise, shirts etc. as many did, but I also stumbled across the fandom. I know many have their opinions on it, but looking at it from the inside, it was a community built upon the core of the show: friendship.

And I've met some life long friends because I decided to delve into it. Everything that came from me enjoying the show ended up putting me in a much happier state of mind and gave me a much more positive outlook.

On the flipside, however, some of my friends were irked - just like you - over how much this one thing seemed to be taking over my life.

I could have toned it down, and eventually (8 years later) I have, but I can honestly say that if it wasn't for this one dumb show coming along at the right time, I have no idea if I'd even still be here.

From my perspective, all I can say is that, given a bit of time, it'll all calm down, but if this is her Muse, it's probably best to let her have it as you can't be sure how much it's helping her state of mind.

Also, listen to [this](https://youtu.be/7Dt4g9CCMks). I dug deep and found some amazing music over the years. This became my summer anthem for a few years ‚ù§Ô∏è it's so uplifting when you're driving around enjoying the sunshine."

But then there was also the extremely high child mortality rate.

But now you have me wondering what they got up to.

Like...I imagine they used leeches. Everyone was using leeches back then."

explainlikeimfive,foq3ht4,t1_foq0nnh,1587981650.0,">The ant is very light, so gravity doesn't provide much force to push it through the air.

Your wording here is a bit awkward. Makes it sound like you're saying gravity is working less on the ant, which obviously isn't true as gravity is acting the same way upon everything it interacts with.

Like if you drop a feather and a brick on the moon they both fall together because of the lack of atmosphere."
