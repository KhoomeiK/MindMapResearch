fatlogic,fqxoe8i,t1_fqxiwlv,1589735424.0,"I can give you the gist of a recipe, but the process is never exactly the same because the liquid content can vary based on so many factors, so I make adjustments based on consistency. Therefore the calorie counts are ""pretty good estimates"" but not precise. 

Step 1: Peel and cut a medium sweet potato and steam in a microwave-save bowl with a little water. I use the ""potato"" setting, it usually takes 6-8 minutes to be soft enough to mash 

Step 2: While the sweet potato is steaming, mix 1/4 c coconut flour, 1/2 c almond flour, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 2 tbsp ground flax and 1 c nonfat plain greek yogurt in a large bowl. Coconut flour and flax both take on a lot of moisture and need time to set. The texture of this mixture should be thick, almost like cheesecake. If it seems too loose after sitting a few minutes, add coconut flour a spoonful at a time and see if it sets up better. 

Step 3: Remove the cooked sweet potato and add 1/2 c packed brown sugar. Sometimes I add a teaspoon of instant coffee here too, it adds an even richer flavor at the end without tasting like coffee crystals. Mash it all together with a fork so the sugar (and coffee) melt in, it will be sort of gummy. Let it cool a bit, it can still be lukewarm but not hot. Preheat the oven to 350.

Step 4: Using an electric mixer, add a cup of almond milk to the sweet potato mixture and mix until there are no chunks. It must be cool enough that the almond milk (and in Step 5, the yogurt) doesn't curdle. This should have the consistency of pumpkin pie before it is baked. 

Step 5: Add the sweet potato/almond milk to the yogurt/flour mixture. Using the mixer, mix in about 3/4 c cocoa powder. Using a spatula, fold in a sprinkle of sea salt, a dash of baking soda, and 1/4 c semi-sweet chocolate chips. At this point the mixture should be very thick but pourable, like fresh cement. If it isn't, slowly add more almond milk or water until the texture is right. If it's too runny, alternate tablespoons of coconut flour and cocoa powder until it is right. 

Step 6: Pour into a lightly oiled glass pan (I use 9x13 for brownies that are about .75 in thick and calculate calories based on 8 servings). Bake at 350 until you decide they're done (~45 minutes, maybe longer. These have a lot of moisture content to steam out so they take a long time). You can taste the batter raw, since there are no eggs or raw wheat flour, but it doesn't taste great until the flavors develop cooking. The batter will be lighter in color than you expect, but it will darken in the oven. Let them cool to room temperature before you cut and eat them. 

Some notes on this ""recipe"": These are too rich for my husband, who prefers a sweeter, more milk-chocolate brownie. I have made it with an egg instead of flax and they turn out fine, I just happen to have flax on hand and like the added fiber as getting protein isn't an issue for me."
fatlogic,fqxhvhc,t1_fqwt89y,1589732531.0,"Of, if you're particularly stubborn about your sweet tooth like me, find ways to manipulate foods to fit the macros. I've spent years learning about the science of baking and slowly integrating alternate ingredients and I finally have some recipes that you cannot tell they are not the junk version, like my brownies that are sweet potato, non-fat plain yogurt, almond milk, flax, coconut flour, almond flour, cocoa powder, brown sugar, chocolate chips, vanilla extract, baking soda and sea salt. The quantities vary batch to batch because it's all predicated on the size of the sweet potato, so calories vary too, but a massive palm-sized brownie usually comes in around 160 calories. They are super fudgy with a rich dark chocolate taste, with only 5g fat, 19g sugar, 6g fiber and 7 g protein (compared to a bakery brownie with 430 calories, 19g fat, 38g sugar, 1g fiber and 5g protein). I add a couple spoons of HaloTop and have a downright decadent desert almost nightly that, while not the pinnacle of health food, is at least pretty nutritionally inoffensive and under 200 calories."

You seem like a genuine, caring soul, and all the positive attributes you give the people around you are attributes you display, too. It's okay to need a break, and it's a sign of strength to recognize that need and give yourself that break to recharge. I have driven myself to burn out in so many areas of life because of the perfectionism that comes with anxiety, and what you are experiencing is extremely common in young, intelligent people who are setting out in the real world. They tell you the real world is harsh and unforgiving, but in many ways that couldn't be further from the truth. Failure is an aspect of being human, and the world easily forgives common perceived ""failures"" like losing a job, getting a bad grade, ending a relationship, etc. Things that feel life-ruining are most often temporary discomforts, but it takes a lot of passing of time to see how minimally those things impact the big picture. Life is rarely easy but it is always navigable, even if you have to make it up as you go along.   


If you don't know what you want right now, don't force decisions that you might feel ""stuck"" in later down the line. In the USA, there are lots of (paid and volunteer) options to work with animals that don't require a degree, like front desk work at an animal shelter or vet clinic, kennel attendant at a boarding center or doggy daycare, working in a pet store. See how working with animals day in day out affects you over time. If your passion grows, awesome, go get that degree! If not, also awesome because you have time to change strategies and you didn't get on an expensive track that wouldn't have panned out long-term! My last bit of advice from someone who has been there, done that: Don't make your life around one thing, so you have other things to lift you up when your ""thing"" is stressing you out. Keep a clear boundary between work/school and your personal life, and find time to nurture other interests and hobbies you enjoy! It's okay if you don't know what those things are yet, now is a time to explore and discover. When you figure out what you love that isn't your career, it's easier to make real friends who share interests.   


As far as making an impact on the world, just do your best to be a good person for now. Be kind to people and animals, speak up for causes you think are just, and do what you can. If everyone did that we wouldn't need someone to save the world, we would all save it together."

worldnews,ffi3k69,t1_ffhwgon,1579964063.0,"I think people are discrediting the Chinese government because of their long history of not telling the truth, policing speech, and committing human rights violations. While I'm not buying into the theories that this is a bioweapon they've unleashed on their own population, I do think their actions should always be examined with a fair amount of scrutiny.   


China has 4-5 times the population of the US, and as of today they are saying about 1000 reported cases. If the US had 200-250 reported cases, should the government quarantine Seattle and Chicago and close Disney parks and all the movie theaters and restaurants? Even 250 cases in one large US city wouldn't shut everything down if it is a basic respiratory illness that most survive except the elderly and immune-compromised . They would tell people to wash their hands more, stay home if experiencing symptoms, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.  


That said, China does not have any where near the public sanitation and health regulations present in the US, and has a much higher population density, so I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. They are likely misrepresenting the data to the outside world to save face, while taking strict preventative and PR measures internally and externally to get control over the situation."
