perth,fdgkjaq,t3_el8blk,1578400390.0," Every evening I see them around my place in the eastern suburbs, they’re beautiful. Sometimes they’ll just sit in the tree and watch me and my dogs wandering around."
bipolar,fdfthzo,t3_ekzl5r,1578369809.0,"This is definitely art. Food art is still art. Like writing, it’s still art. 
Also it’s a shame to eat it because it’s absolutely stunning, but I also just want to reach into the computer and eat the whole thing! Great job!"
australia,fddd18k,t3_ekrmwz,1578306418.0,I love that his first reaction when he caught it was “bubba”. What a guy 😊
bipolar,fdd994h,t3_ekpuyf,1578300732.0,Yep!
bipolar,fd0c4hw,t1_fd0bsa6,1578116724.0,"Yeah I’ve recently been replaying video games because I can’t afford new ones, but they’re about all I can focus on now. Even then it’s pretty bad 🙄"
bipolar,fd07ytr,t3_ejpflf,1578114987.0,"This got me right in the soul. 
I couldn’t tell you how many people tried telling me over the holidays that they have mental illnesses. One claimed she’d had psychosis caused by mania and knew ‘exactly’ what I was talking about. She didn’t. “Oh so you’ve had these symptoms? No? The. Shut the fuck up!”
It’s not ‘cool’ to have bipolar, it’s sure as hell not ‘fun sometimes’ and it’s definitely not ‘funny’ to pretend. 
It triggers me so badly when people say shit like this, but you go on an aggressive, maybe violent, rampage and it’s all your fault.  
“Up your meds” they say. No, I say, “just stop being a dick”."
bipolar,fcph9fl,t3_eidutq,1577863979.0,"Holy crap that’s amazing. I’m in the same boat as you and over the next few weeks will be getting back to art again to make money but WOW I couldn’t draw a dog like that! 
Awesome work!"
bipolar,fcjwncm,t1_fcjw2vc,1577708285.0,"I’ll look into it, thanks 😊"
bipolar,fcjvwbf,t1_fcjvspe,1577707301.0,I’m in Australia not the US. There’s a much smaller amount of groups here unfortunately.
bipolar,fcjrc1t,t3_ehcnso,1577700739.0,"That’s awesome! Great job, you should be really happy with yourself 🤙👍"
bipolar,fcbox2u,t1_fcabfhf,1577589352.0,"I’ve been craving more carbs but not giving in. My eating and exercising is the same, so I don’t know. I did the same with seroquel, except I had a lapband in and still gained a shit tonne of weight so I think my body doesn’t cope well with them."
bipolar,fc8dnms,t1_fc8d29q,1577532562.0,10.3 kilos as of this morning. I’m on track for the same as seroquel weight gain. I’ve been the same weight for 5 years too.
bipolar,fc857xr,t1_fc7zhf1,1577527140.0,"Yeah I’ve already gained weight and I’ve only been on it for 2 weeks, so I’ll be weaning off it ASAP. Bloody annoying that drugs that help come with side effects."
bipolar,fc7vzg4,t3_egixzc,1577520081.0,"My doctor never warned me about the side effects and I read them myself and thought ‘I’ll be fine’ I was not... took it for 3 months and can’t take it again. I gained 35 kilos in 3 months too. 
Had similar side effects with Lurasidone recently, but with really sore muscles, especially my hip/butt area lol it’s weird"
bipolar,fc7vukd,t1_fc7flye,1577519982.0,I made one really cute saying about my dogs then began making swear words and sarcastic crap. It’s the best 😂
bipolar,fc7vrsm,t3_eglvgj,1577519927.0,"Cross stitch is the best! I’ve done it since I was a little kid, but it really calms my bipolar (when I can concentrate enough to do it), I find it so therapeutic. 
This is really cute too, I love it."
perth,fbix30d,t1_fbiwyyh,1576918137.0,True. I didn’t even think of that. Never seen a male plant lol
perth,fbiuuml,t1_fbium0t,1576915378.0,I wish Santa Dave was my neighbour 😂
perth,fbit847,t3_edmcrz,1576913165.0,That’s my kind of Christmas tree. But who the hell leaves it out in public like that?!
bipolar,fbcf07w,t1_fbbv30u,1576722367.0,Same!
bipolar,fafssdm,t1_faee63x,1576030975.0,"That’s great, hearing your experience has made me feel less scared about taking it. I’m going to wait until I’m not home alone just in case. Thank you 😊"
bipolar,fafs3ox,t1_fae51au,1576030487.0,"He didn’t tell me about the food, but I read up about it and wondered if it mattered. Advice taken! That’s the thing I don’t need something long term just for the meantime while I can get back onto oil."
bipolar,fadw09i,t1_fadvs8d,1575987798.0,"That’s what Lexapro did to me when I was 17, so I’ve been ultra careful since then. I just read the list of side effects for Latuda and though I’d come on here and ask others because - holy crap - that list is scary."
bipolar,fadv6ay,t1_fadtoey,1575987167.0,"The hypotension is what has me a little concerned, but because I’m starting on a quarter tablet he thinks I should be okay. I think I’ll be checking my BP just to be safe though. Thanks for that"
