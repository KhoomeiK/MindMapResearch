schizoaffective,erzcr8a,t3_c50yuz,1561431900.0,I‚Äôve been symptom free for 6 months on Vraylar. :) but when I have symptoms it‚Äôs not good. Usually need hospitalized.
schizoaffective,erxlvpf,t3_c4lrjj,1561388039.0,Yes. It‚Äôs just too hard to know what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs not with religion. For me it‚Äôs better to stay away from the organized religions and just have a general belief in God. Reading the Bible triggers me but so do other religious texts. I feel like I can relate.
