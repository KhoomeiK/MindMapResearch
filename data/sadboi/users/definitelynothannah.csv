BipolarReddit,ezvhqko,t3_d2go9d,1568178651.0,"1. This is most important. Do not put too much pressure on yourself if you aren‚Äôt ready. Take only one class if you need to. It‚Äôs better to only take one than to fail out of four.

2. Get as many accommodations as you can. Go to the office of disability. Talk to a counselor. Start a new thread on this sub and ask everyone what accommodations they have.

3. Take care of yourself. Always put your mental health before school and work. Be ok with taking a day off. Make sure you are eating and drinking and trying to shower and what not.

6. You have to have at least one person to talk to and support you. Maybe it‚Äôs your mom. Maybe it‚Äôs your SO. They should also be a good gauge of if you are getting too depressed/manic

7. Talk to your professors if you think that will help

9. Figure out the best way to get you organized. Again, maybe start a thread. Maybe it‚Äôs best for you to have everything written down. Maybe you keep a calendar on your phone.

10. Maybe you never ever manage to pay attention in class. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Put your ass in the seat and use that time awake to do something productive.

11. Learn how to cut your losses. Go to sleep knowing you only have a B amount of knowledge is better than rocking your mental health staying up all night to try for an A but probably getting a C.

12. Sleep schedule. It‚Äôs just so important. Even if you‚Äôre not depressed, you will likely need more sleep or down time than the average person.

13. If you don‚Äôt feel productive start by doing one small thing and letting it snowball. Ex: if you don‚Äôt want to write a paper, just start by responding to one email.

14. Take advantage of any time you feel motivated and get shit done 

This doesn‚Äôt answer your question prob but I wanted to share."
