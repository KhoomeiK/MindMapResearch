bipolar,ez14vl2,t3_czsnbd,1567645158.0,Good job! I’m proud of you too!
lonely,eyxmesl,t1_eyxm43t,1567557025.0,"Thank you, kind stranger. I needed this today"
lonely,eyxjimn,t3_cza0wv,1567554941.0,"I just got out of an 11 year relationship, then had a manic/psychotic episode. I’ve felt disconnected from everyone and everything since then and I don’t know how to come back from it."
BipolarReddit,ey5ztw6,t3_cvhqxk,1566844149.0,This happened to me! I was diagnosed with depression and given SSRIs - I was coming off Paxil which caused a manic episode
Psychosis,ey1pwfy,t3_cuz8mm,1566706977.0,I’ve been on them since May. I started on Latuda which gave me bad side effects so now I’m on Abilify. I still don’t like the side effects (restlessness) and want to lower my dose (I’m on 30 mg).
Psychosis,exwpww3,t3_cuocd6,1566622997.0,"I definitely thought everyone was out to get me when I had psychosis. In the peak of my paranoia, I threw away my phone because I was convinced “bad” people were tracking me on it. The reality was, I had gone missing in another state and my friends were actually looking for me and trying to contact me. When I was “found” I had to go to a psych ward as well, for a week. The first night I didn’t sleep because I thought I was “special” and the doctors were going to capture me and experiment on me as soon as I fell asleep. I also was convinced this is hell (still not sure it’s not) and that I would get to the next level also, which to me was the afterlife. Psychosis is real scary man."
BipolarReddit,exwott6,t1_exwnlpq,1566622529.0,Haha thanks! I like yours!
BipolarReddit,exvywel,t1_exsau5c,1566609313.0,This is how I feel too. No one likes when I’m manic or depressed.
BipolarReddit,exvxpc3,t3_cumi5r,1566608699.0,"I was diagnosed in May, it’s still very new and scary to me too. I’ve never felt more alone. This is a great place to come to though!"
Psychosis,exlr1i8,t3_csc5dr,1566417918.0,It IS true hell. I thought I was going to die there. I never want to go back either which is why I’m forcing myself to be on meds
Psychosis,exgg442,t3_csc5dr,1566263179.0,"This sounds a lot like my psychotic episode. I ran away to another state and at the peak of my paranoia, threw away my phone. I also thought I knew things about the afterlife, I had simulation delusions, I thought my best friends and family were out to get me when really I had gone missing and they were trying to find me. I also felt like nothing was real and that I was all-knowing. I wanted to tell everyone about it. This led to me ending up involuntarily in a psych ward for a week, where I was diagnosed with BP I. The first night I didn’t sleep at all because I had convinced myself the doctors were going to kill me as soon as I went to sleep, or kidnap me and experiment on me because I had “special” powers. In retrospect, I’m glad I was admitted to the hospital because I was also really impulsive, and could have ended up hurting myself or dead. I am really lucky. I too had been diagnosed with just GAD & depression, but I always knew there was something “more” going on. I would definitely show your therapist your post. It might seem like they’re out to get you, but I promise they have your best interest in mind!"
bipolar,exgbo0s,t1_exg1nba,1566259948.0,Sameeee here
bipolar,exgbl5u,t3_csod7q,1566259888.0,"It’s definitely supposed to be a sleeping medication, so it’s strange you’re having this reaction. I wouldn’t change the time you take it until after you talk to your doctor."
bipolar,exgam71,t3_csp6m4,1566259218.0,I empathize with all of this.
bipolar,exga9yh,t3_csn2h3,1566258993.0,This is beautiful!
bipolar,exg1ex5,t3_csghx3,1566253254.0,This is the most perfect description of Bipolar I’ve ever seen
BipolarReddit,exdj3rn,t3_cs7kdy,1566178038.0,"I have been on Prozac, Viibryd, and Paxil. They all stopped working for me after a while. When I came off Paxil it caused a manic episode, so be careful! I’m on Abilify now but going to see if I can get on a mood stabilizer as well."
bipolar,exdhvuj,t1_excyv0s,1566177100.0,This sounds exactly like my manic episode!
BipolarReddit,evxd3je,t1_evxbqzi,1564888707.0,Thank you so much for saying this! I go back to the psychiatrist next Friday so I’m going to ask about it
ImpracticalJokers,evwgiip,t1_evd44yx,1564863510.0,Hahaha just thinking about it makes me laugh so hard
lonely,evuvuj1,t3_clcii2,1564808170.0,I felt like this when I got out of the psych ward and didn’t have a phone for two months. Shit sucks. I still feel a disconnect
BipolarReddit,evuv51r,t1_eveshl4,1564807425.0,"I’m glad you have a close friend who you can talk to! Although it sucks you both have it, at least you can go through it together. I’ve been wanting to check out support groups, just gotta get over the social anxiety part of it. I did make an appointment with a therapist next week!"
BipolarReddit,evuv2bf,t1_evffwsl,1564807345.0,"I’m glad you’re on the right track with therapy and medication! I just made an appointment with a new therapist today. Also I can’t imagine growing up / living with this illness 20 or 30 years ago, I am thankful for the internet at times like these!"
BipolarReddit,evuux8c,t1_evgowq5,1564807200.0,"Thank you so much for all of this, it’s so well thought out. I appreciate all of your kind words and I feel the slightest bit better just from reading this. And I want to check out that book!"
BipolarReddit,evs05of,t1_evryfh6,1564724448.0,I love how you put this. The last sentence especially
bipolar,evepqvk,t3_cjk89j,1564474653.0,"I literally said ""whoa"" out loud. This is fantastic. And the story behind it too, amazing job!"
bipolar,eveopok,t1_evd1clw,1564473597.0,"Latuda did the same for me as well! I'm on Abilify now, and it still gives me akathisia but not as intensely. I guess I'm going to see if it gets better if not i might have to change it up again because I can't stand the feeling. I move around and move my legs up and down constantly."
bipolar,eveoitj,t1_eveaetg,1564473408.0,I love this and I'm going to use it! Thanks!
bipolar,eveno80,t1_evck8h3,1564472570.0,"I was prescribed Hydroxyzine by my regular doctor for anxiety, then at the psych ward was prescribed it for insomnia. Sometimes my prescribed 3 are not strong enough to knock me out, other times 1 or 2 helps me fall asleep. But I definitely wake up in the morning groggy and don't want to get out of bed. Another complaint is that it hurts my stomach, but I'm not sure if it's that or just the Abilify or both."
bipolar,even81v,t3_cjk7b4,1564472135.0,OH MY GOD TOO REAL HAHAHA
bipolar,evdkd7r,t1_ev70e7f,1564440363.0,"Thanks for sharing this! I honestly wasn't sure if the leg thing was from mania or my medication. A rocking chair is such a good idea! And I need to get something to stim with my hands, usually I need a rock or a crystal."
bipolar,evdk8p6,t1_ev5f8tw,1564440275.0,"No I didn't! I was confused about that as well, since I read that most BP patients get a mood stabilizer. I go back in about a week and I'm going to ask about it! I don't want to be on medication but anything to not have another episode."
Psychosis,evdgh84,t3_cjhqn5,1564437662.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this right now. I definitely empathize, I had my first manic / psychotic episode in May. Im from florida but i drove to new york and ended up walking around barefoot for almost 3 days. i dont remember most of it. but as fucked up as it is, it was the happiest I've been in years. I also was following my own path and everything was starting to make sense. Then I ended up in a psych ward involuntarily for a week. Now I'm out and trying to adjust and having a really hard time. I quit drinking alcohol for now also. I feel really lonely too and don't know anyone who has Bipolar 1 let alone has had a psychotic episode, so it really feels like my friends and family don't get it. Now I'm extremely depressed yet anxious and restless."
Ghostbc,ev3qbhe,t3_ci6tmd,1564199550.0,"Welcome! I've been into Ghost since Infestissumam, which is my favorite album! I'm obsessed with all of their albums though, I enjoy their differences in sound, one for every mood!"
bipolar,ev3plty,t3_ci7ntk,1564199189.0,"I definitely do, it suuuucks"
bipolar,ev3pem5,t3_chz7ap,1564199086.0,Good job! It's such an accomplishment for me to just get a load of laundry done these days.
bipolar,ev3oghn,t3_ci8uqz,1564198600.0,This looks like something out of my notebooks from when I'm manic.... I actually can follow this haha
