Based on my experience, continued use of psychedelics and stimulant makes my schizophrenic/bipolar symptoms worst. Start from make him STOP using stimulants. 

Regarding helping your brother. That's a tough one. Speaking for myself. No one can make me seek help till i voluntarily did it myself."

For you, show her a lot of love and attention. She's going to need it. I would've turned out better if my parents were less narcissistic. Ive been designing video games now."

Too much THC can cause anxiety (bad trip) but it never trigger schizophrenia or bipolar. I normally mix CBD to help me out a bit."

Even just a thank you and a tap back. I just think people forget that there is a person behind a profile and easy to forget. 

I had these guy i met on a party and curious why i was intentionally ignoring him and called me rude. I told him, you did the same thing to me on Grindr. I told him, not everyone is going after your rude and nasty butthole. Some are just bored and looking for someone to chat or friends.  There are million ways to say ""Im not interested"" politely. I haven't meet anyone who rudely told me to fuck off after a rejection. Im curious to some of these people saying ""why sometimes it's a hussle to response and easier to ghost."" I have a feeling there are way over their head and think they are that special. ðŸ˜†"

You asked a question thinking it might be a legitimate question and you are being a jack ass with lack of reading comprehension. I have a feeling you posted just to be a jack ass. Why?

With 1 blue mana to protect Sephara with Siren Stormtamer is demoralizing.  It's just weak to 2 cards, Cry and Goblin Chainwhirler, but it's easy to play around. Not a lot of players use premium removal against 1 1/1 flyers. It's so easy to set it up too and it happens more often, I meant it's consistent."

Don't get me wrong. I d/c myself but it's either, 2 already d/c within 2 mins of the game. Or. Firat down and received series of bad unhooks and intentionally tunneled. But only it's my last hook."
deadbydaylight,epj6r9h,t1_ephusbq,1559248584.0,Getting hit by a killer then show his/her aura sounds great. But it need more than 2 sec. Alert perk is great even while getting chased. When a killer break a pallet or gen. It gives me an idea where is the killera next move.
