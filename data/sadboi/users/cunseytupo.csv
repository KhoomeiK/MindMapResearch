askwomenadvice,erhw8j6,t1_erggtl0,1560884219.0,I am actually. Just I'd say meds are the only benefits I'm receiving from that.
depression,erd4l8w,t1_erd2qri,1560730722.0,"God damnit, you are making sense and logic scares me. (Especially about the social media shit, since that was causing me to feel bad. Not because of comparing myself or anytving that time) Thank you a lot though. I will be going to sleep now, night."
depression,erd05ty,t1_ercytcy,1560726965.0,"Yeah, I did that before, then went back, rinse and repeat. To me it feels like I've got a connection with people, which I dearly needed since it's been causing me to be miserable. 

I've gotten two new hobbies actually, one was collecting artwork and another one card tricks. Thing is, the first one I can't do anymore because of work. I follow so many people and they release so much I can't keep up, you know? 

That made me feel worse, so I stopped. 

And since card tricks are hard it's difficult for me to practice them because I just give up when I can't magically do shit easily.

One thing I realised yesterday though: when I feel bad I won't be drinking alcohol when going out since it makes my mental health worse. so thats that I guess (+ it saves money and I can improve my driving)

shit man. life is conflicting, confusing and fucking annoying 

i want to experience the great side of it, like experiencing being loved and loving someone.

guess you can't force any of these things into your life

fair enough."
