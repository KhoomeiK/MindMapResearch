Needless sacrifice. Why are you still putting yourself last? The universe has shown you, time and time again, that this time-period is meant for you to step back into your power. You’re not going to be able to do that by putting yourself on the back burner. I know, it’s hard but set your boundaries and DO NOT cross them. If the people around you cannot respect your boundaries, stand your ground. You should not have to feel like your voice doesn’t matter as much. This time period that you are entering is a new chapter, a fresh start! Close your eyes and envision yourself taking back all of that energy you have been giving away to people. It’s in your hands, imagine yourself drinking from the cup of the Universe. Bask in the presence, meditate, get your mind right. You have shit to do and it’s time to stop playing games with your destiny. Get serious about your dreams! It’s time to put in the work. The Universe wants to bring you an abundance of success. Be honest with yourself… It was a toxic situation and maybe you were a little toxic too. Forgive yourself and know you will do better next time. Everything happens for a reason. You’ve been starting to realize your true purpose in life, you’re still on the right path. Pain is only temporary. Release that relationship, release the emotions, the heartache… Something better is coming. Have faith and focus on yourself for now. <3 You got this!

Properties of Malachite: Malachite is a stone of balance, abundance, manifestation and intention. Malachite absorbs energy and draws emotions to the surface. It clears and activates all Chakras, and is especially helpful in the stimulation of the Heart and Throat Chakras.

I sense that you’re having a hard time letting go of someone. Maybe you’ve experienced a recent breakup, divorce, loss of a loved one, or grief of some kind… Sometimes things don’t really make sense and that’s okay. You don’t need all of the answers right now, it would do you no good anyway and you know that. It’s okay to feel down in the dumps. I see you beating yourself up for feeling overwhelming emotions and not knowing how to really sift through those in a healthy manner. Take a deep ass breath babe, you’re going to be okay! You don’t have to carry the weigh of the world on your shoulders. Reconnect with those that you love. Don’t isolate yourself because of this. Times are already hard enough on us all! Everything just seems to be crashing down but I promise it’s going to be okay. I’m not sure if you’ve been thinking about moving, starting a family or some kind of big life change, but just know that the Universe has your back in this situation. I also see reuniting with a family member or friend because of this change. It’s going to be so healing for you! Change is scary and your feelings are completely valid; let it out! You need a good CRY. Embrace that this season of your life is not full of rainbows and sunshines. It’s OKAY. You have no reason to feel guilty my love. When’s the last time you took some time to clear your head? Do what you need to do. I know life has been hard but because of it, you are stronger and more courageous than most. There’s no obstacle that you cannot overcome! Release the grudges, your heart will thank you.

Properties of Smoky Quartz: Smokey Quartz emits a high level of energy. It helps ground the holder with Earth energies and is good for working with the Root and Solar Plexus Chakras. Use Smokey Quartz to absorb and transmute negative energy.

You might not feel like it, but something really great is about to happen to you! Something that doesn’t happen often for most people. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE!! The Universe is calling you to dust your shoulders off and get back to work! You made a promise to yourself and you deserve to pull through. Whatever this is, know that it’s going to pay off! Your angel guardians are guiding you and protecting you. Been seeing 111, 222 lately? Yeah, best believe that shit is about to change for the better. All you have to do is put your best foot forward and keep crossing off those important things on your to-do list. No more procrastinating. You can reach a place of balance by being creative. If you need to take some time to yourself, away from people, do it. Retreat and make things that make your soul smile. You are dying to be bursting at the seems with good ideas and new projects, so what’s holding you back? The past is in the past and there’s nothing that you can change about it. Don’t let opportunities pass you by because you are too busy throwing a pity party for yourself! You know you need some tuff luv. It’s okay to scream sometimes!! GET ANGRY, LET THAT SHIT OUT!! RELEASE THE PAST!!!! You know you made the right decision, there’s no time to second guess yourself now. You’re so damn tired of feeling this way. Realize, you are so much wiser and stronger than you once were. Find that strength again and celebrate yourself. You made it through! Now it’s time to turn the page. What will you write on these blank pages? It’s all in your hands now. Don’t let yourself down, you deserve it! You are more than capable. “Take all my pain and turn it into moonlight, take all my pain and melt it with the sunshine, take all my pain and turn it into white light, take all my pain and give myself a good life.” (Lost in the Cold by Twiddle)

Properties of Gray Agate: Grey agate is considered as a grounding stone that brings a person into emotional, intellectual and physical balance. It is a great stone for stabilizing physical energy, brings both positive and negative energy in place. It is often used for bringing love and abundance, it will help you relieve stress and feel better."

Maybe you’ve experienced a recent breakup, divorce, loss of a loved one, or grief of some kind… Sometimes things don’t really make sense and that’s okay. You don’t need all of the answers right now, it would do you no good anyway and you know that. It’s okay to feel down in the dumps. I see you beating yourself up for feeling overwhelming emotions and not knowing how to really sift through those in a healthy manner. Take a deep ass breath babe, you’re going to be okay! You don’t have to carry the weigh of the world on your shoulders. Reconnect with those that you love. Don’t isolate yourself because of this. Times are already hard enough on us all! Everything just seems to be crashing down but I promise it’s going to be okay. I’m not sure if you’ve been thinking about moving, starting a family or some kind of big life change, but just know that the Universe has your back in this situation. I also see reuniting with a family member or friend because of this change. It’s going to be so healing for you! Change is scary and your feelings are completely valid; let it out! You need a good CRY. Embrace that this season of your life is not full of rainbows and sunshines. It’s OKAY. You have no reason to feel guilty my love. When’s the last time you took some time to clear your head? Do what you need to do. I know life has been hard but because of it, you are stronger and more courageous than most. There’s no obstacle that you cannot overcome! Release the grudges, your heart will thank you.

Properties of Smoky Quartz: Smokey Quartz emits a high level of energy. It helps ground the holder with Earth energies and is good for working with the Root and Solar Plexus Chakras. Use Smokey Quartz to absorb and transmute negative energy.

You might not feel like it, but something really great is about to happen to you! Something that doesn’t happen often for most people. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE!! The Universe is calling you to dust your shoulders off and get back to work! You made a promise to yourself and you deserve to pull through. Whatever this is, know that it’s going to pay off! Your angel guardians are guiding you and protecting you. Been seeing 111, 222 lately? Yeah, best believe that shit is about to change for the better. All you have to do is put your best foot forward and keep crossing off those important things on your to-do list. No more procrastinating. You can reach a place of balance by being creative. If you need to take some time to yourself, away from people, do it. Retreat and make things that make your soul smile. You are dying to be bursting at the seems with good ideas and new projects, so what’s holding you back? The past is in the past and there’s nothing that you can change about it. Don’t let opportunities pass you by because you are too busy throwing a pity party for yourself! You know you need some tuff luv. It’s okay to scream sometimes!! GET ANGRY, LET THAT SHIT OUT!! RELEASE THE PAST!!!! You know you made the right decision, there’s no time to second guess yourself now. You’re so damn tired of feeling this way. Realize, you are so much wiser and stronger than you once were. Find that strength again and celebrate yourself. You made it through! Now it’s time to turn the page. What will you write on these blank pages? It’s all in your hands now. Don’t let yourself down, you deserve it! You are more than capable. “Take all my pain and turn it into moonlight, take all my pain and melt it with the sunshine, take all my pain and turn it into white light, take all my pain and give myself a good life.” (Lost in the Cold by Twiddle)

Needless sacrifice. Why are you still putting yourself last? The universe has shown you, time and time again, that this time-period is meant for you to step back into your power. You’re not going to be able to do that by putting yourself on the back burner. I know, it’s hard but set your boundaries and DO NOT cross them. If the people around you cannot respect your boundaries, stand your ground. You should not have to feel like your voice doesn’t matter as much. This time period that you are entering is a new chapter, a fresh start! Close your eyes and envision yourself taking back all of that energy you have been giving away to people. It’s in your hands, imagine yourself drinking from the cup of the Universe. Bask in the presence, meditate, get your mind right. You have shit to do and it’s time to stop playing games with your destiny. Get serious about your dreams! It’s time to put in the work. The Universe wants to bring you an abundance of success. Be honest with yourself… It was a toxic situation and maybe you were a little toxic too. Forgive yourself and know you will do better next time. Everything happens for a reason. You’ve been starting to realize your true purpose in life, you’re still on the right path. Pain is only temporary. Release that relationship, release the emotions, the heartache… Something better is coming. Have faith and focus on yourself for now. <3 You got this!

Properties of Malachite: Malachite is a stone of balance, abundance, manifestation and intention. Malachite absorbs energy and draws emotions to the surface. It clears and activates all Chakras, and is especially helpful in the stimulation of the Heart and Throat Chakras.

LOL, y’all go ahead and buckle up cause this is about to be a little bumpy. (I can see the eye rolls now) I know, I know but CHILL. Listen, you know better. I know times have been hard. The collective energy is just heavy and draining. We’ve all been experiencing this together. I don’t know if it’s out of sheer boredom, or if you are trying to mask some pain, but spirit is urging you to listen to your body. The substances are doing your mental health and physical health more harm than good right now. It might be alcohol, food, drugs, marijuana, video games.. Whatever you’ve been using to distract yourself has now become a little bit of a dependancy. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with doing those things, but when it becomes a crutch in regards to emotions… It’s bound to collapse at some point. Not all of you are struggling with substances so if that doesn’t apply, let it fly.

It’s no coincidence that this pile is the Selenite tower and the Tower (reversed) popped up here. It’s not over, yet. I know that’s not what you really wanted to hear. There’s still a long road ahead but know that you are getting there! A little setback isn’t something to lose yourself over! Pick your head up, love. You are STRONG, powerful and capable. Dust yourself off and come up with a new game plan! There’s a really strong emphasis on physical health here. Particularly lung issues, stomach issues and headaches. Give your body a break from the junk! DETOX!! Some new-found discipline is needed here but know that this phase won’t last forever. You are going to start feeling better in no time!! Write down your negative thoughts, your bad feelings, on a piece of paper and burn it away! Imagine all of those fears being burned to the ground. 

You are magical and you have everything it takes to manifest the reality that you long for. Take yourself seriously!! You are worth the fight. 

I’m seeing a new opportunity coming in, in regards to a job or money of some kind! Take it!! Start saving, start planning, start organizing and SPEND SOME TIME OUTSIDE!!! Your soul will thank you."

Okay, WOW. This pile is full of LOVE! There’s a very playful and child-like energy here. Now, a lot of you will probably look at the cards and think that love is coming your way and it definitely IS but not from another person. I see this whole spread being focused on SELF-LOVE! You have spent so much time and energy chasing others just to be left heartbroken and confused in the end. It’s time to stop focusing on things that aren’t matching your energy. You don’t need anyone else to be whole, YOU ARE COMPLETELY WHOLE ON YOUR OWN. Some of you may even by going through a “dry-spell”. The whole purpose of this time is to build yourself up. The harder you keep trying to push and force your way into a relationship, the more resistance you will feel. Let things flow naturally, focus on yourself, focus on your health and watch the manifestation come to fruition. A lot of you have been working on yourself for such a long time. I know, I know. It’s hard. You feel lonely, you just want some human interaction. Feeling these things isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign that you are HUMAN. We all crave connection. 

You are entering a new chapter in life. A new direction, a new approach is required. It’s right around the corner! You’ve been feeling it but you’ve felt a little apprehensive. Your intuition is only clouded because of the extra noise around you; not because you aren’t intuitive. Trust yourself more! Give yourself more credit. The answers are already within; all you have to do is tune in. There’s so much to be grateful for, so much love and positivity around you. Receive it, embrace it and proactive gratitude. You are blessed. Don’t ignore the obvious because a new opportunity is approaching. Love, in many forms, is about to come knocking on your door. Are you ready?

Wow, the energy is pretty heavy with this pile. You guys have been fighting a pretty intense inner battle. Your whole body is so tense; it’s okay to relax. Take a few seconds to relax your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, and release that breath while imagining the burdens lifting off of your shoulders. I’m sensing some blockages in the Heart Chakra. Sometimes when that chakra is blocked, it can feel like we are carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders. Why are you picking up burdens that don’t even belong to you? Release, release, release. Relax, get some sleep, take a warm bath, drink a soothing cup of tea.

You’ve been feeling trapped inside of your own mind. The thoughts are loud and sometimes they just won’t stop, but spirit is calling you to step back into your power! You’ve buried the way you really feel, in hopes that it would bring peace around you but it ended up breaking you inside. It’s okay to not be okay sometimes. I know you like to show people that you have it all together but know that your angels see your tears. They hear your cries, your worries, your wishes. They have been trying to get your attention by leaving little signs. Seeing lots of 444? 777? You are protected, you are safe. You are appreciated, loved and heard. Your intuition is still speaking to you. All you have to do is clear the junk around it and tune in. Get back on track! Try meditating, yoga, reading, writing… Something that will help you release all of this negative energy! It is no longer serving you, you must let go. Not all is lost but it’s time to pick up the remaining pieces and charge forward. ONLY after you relax a bit first. Give yourself a break. Mental health is JUST as important. Self care my love. Breathe, you got this. Don’t let ANYONE make you feel lesser, because quite frankly, you are a fucking GEM. PERIOD. Something better is around the corner, just you wait."

**Okay, WOW. This pile is full of LOVE! There’s a very playful and child-like energy here. Now, a lot of you will probably look at the cards and think that love is coming your way and it definitely IS but not from another person. I see this whole spread being focused on SELF-LOVE! You have spent so much time and energy chasing others just to be left heartbroken and confused in the end. It’s time to stop focusing on things that aren’t matching your energy. You don’t need anyone else to be whole, YOU ARE COMPLETELY WHOLE ON YOUR OWN. Some of you may even by going through a “dry-spell”. The whole purpose of this time is to build yourself up. The harder you keep trying to push and force your way into a relationship, the more resistance you will feel. Let things flow naturally, focus on yourself, focus on your health and watch the manifestation come to fruition. A lot of you have been working on yourself for such a long time. I know, I know. It’s hard. You feel lonely, you just want some human interaction. Feeling these things isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign that you are HUMAN. We all crave connection.**

**You are entering a new chapter in life. A new direction, a new approach is required. It’s right around the corner! You’ve been feeling it but you’ve felt a little apprehensive. Your intuition is only clouded because of the extra noise around you; not because you aren’t intuitive. Trust yourself more! Give yourself more credit. The answers are already within; all you have to do is tune in. There’s so much to be grateful for, so much love and positivity around you. Receive it, embrace it and proactive gratitude. You are blessed. Don’t ignore the obvious because a new opportunity is approaching. Love, in many forms, is about to come knocking on your door. Are you ready?**

**Wow, the energy is pretty heavy with this pile. You guys have been fighting a pretty intense inner battle. Your whole body is so tense; it’s okay to relax. Take a few seconds to relax your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, and release that breath while imagining the burdens lifting off of your shoulders. I’m sensing some blockages in the Heart Chakra. Sometimes when that chakra is blocked, it can feel like we are carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders. Why are you picking up burdens that don’t even belong to you? Release, release, release. Relax, get some sleep, take a warm bath, drink a soothing cup of tea.**

**You’ve been feeling trapped inside of your own mind. The thoughts are loud and sometimes they just won’t stop, but spirit is calling you to step back into your power! You’ve buried the way you really feel, in hopes that it would bring peace around you but it ended up breaking you inside. It’s okay to not be okay sometimes. I know you like to show people that you have it all together but know that your angels see your tears. They hear your cries, your worries, your wishes. They have been trying to get your attention by leaving little signs. Seeing lots of 444? 777? You are protected, you are safe. You are appreciated, loved and heard. Your intuition is still speaking to you. All you have to do is clear the junk around it and tune in. Get back on track! Try meditating, yoga, reading, writing… Something that will help you release all of this negative energy! It is no longer serving you, you must let go. Not all is lost but it’s time to pick up the remaining pieces and charge forward. ONLY after you relax a bit first. Give yourself a break. Mental health is JUST as important. Self care my love. Breathe, you got this. Don’t let ANYONE make you feel lesser, because quite frankly, you are a fucking GEM. PERIOD. Something better is around the corner, just you wait.**"

**LOL, y’all go ahead and buckle up cause this is about to be a little bumpy. (I can see the eye rolls now) I know, I know but CHILL. Listen, you know better. I know times have been hard. The collective energy is just heavy and draining. We’ve all been experiencing this together. I don’t know if it’s out of sheer boredom, or if you are trying to mask some pain, but spirit is urging you to listen to your body. The substances are doing your mental health and physical health more harm than good right now. It might be alcohol, food, drugs, marijuana, video games.. Whatever you’ve been using to distract yourself has now become a little bit of a dependancy. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with doing those things, but when it becomes a crutch in regards to emotions… It’s bound to collapse at some point. Not all of you are struggling with substances so if that doesn’t apply, let it fly.**
