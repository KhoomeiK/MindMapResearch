Lactimal is a mood stabiliser and as you rightly say has anti seizure properties. However its not the only drug that can do both of these things. 

My feeling is that you should maybe think about raising how your mood has been with your prescriber. Dont pressure yourself into an immediate switch at this point - Just have the conversation if you can. They *will* have heard it before and they *do* want to help you. 

I know everyone says that meds can be tweaked and it sometimes takes a couple of attempts until you get somewhere but its true. And I know how scary and overwhelming that idea can be. It seems like a huge mountain to climb. 

Dont let yourself get too unwell OP. If theres one thing Ive learned in all of this its that sometimes we need proper help and thats ok. I wish you all the best ❤"
MentalHealthUK,eyq71zw,t3_cy2q6j,1567328650.0,"Rode this merry go round a few years ago. Went through an initial crisis period and was put onto medication (which did help massively) but it was clear that talking therapy was required. I got to see the guy after 2 months of waiting but my sessions were cut short after I disclosed self harming ideas and suicidal thoughts. I was told he was no longer allowed to treat me because of this and I would have to see a high intensity therapist. So I was booted back out to the land of no formal support for another 4 months until one was available. It was great.... 


Im now back in the position of requiring their services. I was referred in march. Had my initial assessments in march. The telephone assessment lasted 2 and a half hours (its supposed to be 30 minutes) The doctor on duty for the area then rang me again separately later in the day to discuss things further. Then I was listed for treatment.

I havent heard from them since. Its September today. I tell myself that everyday that passes means its a day closer but Im very aware of how underfunded mental health services have become and the potential consequences of these waits for all of us. 

There are very few therapists who specialise in what I need right now. I dont blame the health service. I blame the government and the huge push to save money and quietly sell off service provision."
