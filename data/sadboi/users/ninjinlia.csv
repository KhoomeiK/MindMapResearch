It is even slightly above average. And your skills matter the most. Don't know exact sizes as both the biggest and smallest I've slept with were just FWBs and we never talked about it but the smallest one was definitely better. The biggest one knew he was big and thought that was enough. When I told him I would like him to use his fingers and mouth as well he just said well I'm not good with that. The smallest one knew he was small but never let that affect him. He was good at oral and knew what he was doing in general. A lot better experience than the big guy.

We broke up halfway through my last year of high school due to many reasons but we stayed close. I had plans to move as well from even before he did. Different town, same country. I was happy. I couldn't wait. Until he killed himself one day after my high school graduation. I was a mess. I wanted to follow him. So I gave myself one last chance. I had to go through with my plans to move. I wouldn't have survived otherwise. And so I went. Three months after his death I crossed the continent to try my last chance at life. For a while it was hell. Even worse than back home as this time I was alone. I had decided to kill myself on the same date. I made plans as how to do it, suicide note and everything. But decided that there's nothing left to lose if I tried to get help. It will either work or I will follow through with my plan. Well, I started taking antidepressants which made stuff a bit better. Good enough for me to go out and do something instead of locking myself in my room. Well, that's when I met my current boyfriend. It was hard and scary but with more professional help and his support, instead of dying on the one year anniversary I played video games instead. I am still suffering, I still have a shit ton of mental issues but almost two years later I am alive. Alive and making plans for the next 10. If I hadn't moved I wouldn't be here today to tell my story."
