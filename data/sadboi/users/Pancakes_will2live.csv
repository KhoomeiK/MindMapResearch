Jobs in fast food aren't the most fun, but you can learn a lot from them, and repeating the same things to clients, while having a manager to supervise helps a lot. You'll eventually develop initiative in your work environment and problem solving abilities, that are useful in your personal life as well. Plus, they always need more employees and will teach you jow to do your job.

Once you have a job, consider taking photos of your bruises or recordings of your dad's abuse and save them in a place where no one can touch them. Once you feel you have enough, you can go to the police station and report the abuse. Depending on what you want, you can at least get a restraining order and maybe even financial help to move out, depending on where you're from.

depression,fghu51g,t1_fghthfg,1580793940.0,Oh woah. That's unexpected.  I will definitely go see a doctor. I hope you got all the help possible. Thank you for caring.
depression,fghtyhl,t1_fghtju9,1580793788.0,"Oh really? Then I'll get an appointment as soon as I can. It sucks and I want it to stop. Are you still in pain? Did you finally get help? 

I'm already on meds (I've been for a year) but it doesn't really work anymore. My psychiatrist is busy but I have an appointment in a few weeks."
SuicideWatch,fghtpjh,t1_fghrgat,1580793581.0,"Honestly even working at McDonald's is a good way to start while you keep job hunting. I've been there and it's not a bad place to work. I wish you all the best and hope you'll find a job that you enjoy. You already have the basics down to live by yourself so relax. It might be scary, but we soon get used to it and start a routine. I personally like to buy second hand books, they're cheaper, but goint to your local library is also an option. 

You deserve to be happy."
depression,fghtcfd,t1_fghsg24,1580793283.0,"Yes it's always worth getting help and keep looking for help. You're worth it. It's painful, living hurts but your life is precious. We all deserve to be happy and feel at peace, that's why we're still alive. 
There is always someone somewhere who can help, we just have to find them."
SuicideWatch,fghq2i8,t1_fghp1ud,1580790746.0,"I moved far from home and got roomates. I actually rented a bedroom/shared kitchen for pretry cheap and worked. I had a sucky job, but one with tip and the extra 10$ per shift helped. Cooking my own meals and eating vegetarian to cut the food expenses. Going to free activities close to my interests to meet people. Even if you don't make any friends, meeting and chatting with other helps your mental health.  It was expensive at first but after 2-3 months you get used to a smaller budget. You actually don't need a lot to survive,  and you slowly start to save up for something better."
SuicideWatch,fgho39v,t1_fghnm06,1580789332.0,"I'll try to say this with as much tact as I can, but please go see your therapist and a counselor at your school, before dropping out. Even if you don't study anymore, you might be able to get help to get out of that place. This is very toxic and I hope you can escape it soon, in a non lethal way.  I don't know where you're from but I've been living by myself since I was 16, just like many of my friends, and I'm sure anyone can. You deserve a calm place full of love at the end of the day, I really wish you can find one soon."
depression,fghnlj9,t3_ey9q4f,1580788982.0,"There are so many medications available and you have to take them for at least 3 monthe to evaluate the effects. The side effects eventually fade with time as you get used to the medication so hang in there! You can still find the one that works for you.

May I also suggest that you seek a different therapist? Showing up to therapy is a sing you're willing to try to get better. Maybe they weren't the right one for you, it took me a while to find one that felt right, but don't lose hope. There are thousands of therapists in the UK, at least one of them can help."
depression,fghn64b,t3_eyjdef,1580788685.0,"A PhD? That's amazing!!! You must've worked so much to get into your program. Don't forget to celebrate, even if it's just by eating a 4th cookie instead of 3, you deserve it!"
SuicideWatch,fghmryd,t3_eyj81j,1580788407.0,"Depression and anxiety are both real and you're not a ''slack off''. Not getting the support of your family is maybe one of the hardest things in life, but only because as a society, we value immensely the opinion of our family and close friends because ''they know best''. They don't. You know yourself best and your limits. I don't know much about your situation but maybe talking to your therapist about taking a break or leaving for a short while the place you're in right now. Taking a break can help clear thoughts and help focus on which (tiny and slow, but steady) steps to take to feel better. 

In the end, you are the only one who can save yourself (although getting professional help makes it easier) and I know it's painful, but you're worth it. No one deserves to be in pain, not even your worst enemy."
SuicideWatch,fghlze9,t3_eyjcjz,1580787859.0,"Have you looked for help groups close to your city/town? Depending on where you live, maybe there is a free healthcare system you can contact. Finding someone to talk to would be a first step, and the suicide hotline might be able to refer you to someone or some organisation that could help or give you useful information.  
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier than a close friend. Keep fighting, you're worth it, jo matter what the evil cloud in your head says."
SuicideWatch,fghlgt6,t3_eyjk89,1580787515.0,"I understand your pain. I'm here for the same reason as you. You've endured so much and it is admirable how long you've survived. You're admirable.

Baking goods is one of the best things one can get, because food is great. I think it's wonderful you have something you enjoy doing and it's very nice of you to want to share."
depression,fgen0jf,t1_fgemats,1580703659.0,"True, I do that when pain gets too much to bare, and when everything feels numb I go to sleep. It's not very healthy, indeed, but sometimes it's the only way to not feel the pain."
depression,fgem8bp,t1_fgelvhp,1580703047.0,Thank you. Seeing I'm not alone helps me endure the pain. I'll be able to sleep tonight.
SuicideWatch,fgejws3,t3_ey0mqj,1580701292.0,"No one deserves pain, not even your worst enemy since is sucks so much. This subreddit is full of people just like us who want to end it all but we don't because we all hope for something better....eventually."
SuicideWatch,ffsix7m,t1_ffsgy0p,1580182813.0,Therapy is a good place to seek help. I'm rooting for your wellbeing.
SuicideWatch,ffsgu7f,t1_ffsajr6,1580181373.0,"As someone currently on medication, I can confirm that once you're on the right meds, it gets better. It takes a while to notice, but it does help a lot. It's not a magic pill that makes life wonderful, but it helps regulating the chemical in your brain that make you feel bad. 

My dad was absolutely against it, but I know it helped me feel better still does.

I hope your pain will ease away soon."
