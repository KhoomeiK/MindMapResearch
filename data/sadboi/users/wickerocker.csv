AttachmentParenting,fp8e88k,t3_gbrjne,1588390088.0,"It took awhile for my husband and I to figure it out but we’ve found a way to get time with each other while still being available for the kids. You have to make your marriage a priority, though. That doesn’t mean that good marriages only happen when children are kept out of your bed, or anything else really. You just have to talk to each other to figure out your priorities and then find a way to make those priorities happen.

For example, my husband and I have gotten very creative with places to have sex after having our first child, who bedshares. There have been many nights when one of us puts the kid to bed, then sneaks out for some living room couch nookie. We have also had “dinner” dates at 3:00pm because we’d be able to get quick service and be home in time to do a proper bedtime. Right now what we do is he puts the toddler to bed while I get the infant to sleep. Then I have to go wake him up because he always falls asleep with the toddler. My husband vapes and I drink wine in our laundry room or outside, then we try to bang one out and/or watch some TV together. Or we just talk. Either way, that couple of hours every evening is essential to our marriage. Sometimes the baby wakes up and cuts things short, but usually we find time for one another."
AmItheAsshole,fp4hx95,t3_gaw4yl,1588299429.0,"Your older daughter has needed more from you at a more challenging time in your life, but you are her **mom.** She needed you to love her and forgive her and show her the way. She knew that she was a burden, so she needed you to shoulder that burden with compassion and empathy. She has known for years that her younger sister made better choices, but she needed you to love her with equal tenacity anyway. She did not plan her pregnancy which tainted it with a certain level of anxiety, and then she now gets to see your response to her sister’s pregnancy - older daughter’s lack of a baby shower feels like a punishment while younger daughter’s party seems like a reward. Older daughter feels like her child is not as celebrated or desired by you as younger daughter’s impending child will be, so older daughter is withdrawing the child from you until you can demonstrate that your grandchild is someone you love 100% (by your older daughter’s standards).

ESH but you have the most power to change the situation. You can really own the fact that you resented your older daughter’s pregnancy and apologize humbly for that without placing any blame on your daughter for your feelings. You can ask your daughter what you can do to make things better. You can try to make up for the list baby shower with some other special party."

My son (nearly 3 years old), wants my attention every second of the day and I also have a newborn. When I finally get the baby calmed down and start cooking, my son will do all of my pet peeves in a row - hang on my body with all his weight, shout random vowels as loud as possible every two seconds, open every drawer in the kitchen and remove things going “What’s that?” before throwing it on the floor, shine a flashlight into my eyes, antagonize the dog...you get the idea.

And I’ve also gotten used to his words being different than what I might want to hear but knowing that he is trying to use my language. Sometimes I just tell him what I need to hear, and over the years he has gotten better at knowing when/how to say things.

It goes both ways, too. When I get frustrated, I try to reach out to him with a hug or by doing his usual chores and then he usually says nice things to me after that. Sometimes our partner’s love tanks are empty and that is why they aren’t speaking our love language.

DebateAnAtheist,fmowkg0,t1_fmmspo3,1586269896.0,"Ao, as an atheist, from my perspective it appears that religions have answers for everything in order to keep people in the faith. That is why mainstream religions like Christianity and Islam are so successful. You said it yourself - oh, I’m gay? Well it’s a test of my commitment to my religion. I’m debating a person in another post right now who says that because I left Christianity I must never have been a good enough Christian to begin with (because if I had been, I wouldn’t have left). These are fail-safes designed to keep people trapped and obeying the rules. There is also a lot of fear instilled in those who believe, such as punishment or hatred from God if you don’t obey, and fear is a powerfully motivating emotion. So you have this set of rules laid out for you, explanations for why you are the way you are (even if it contradicts the rules, like being created with homosexual desires when being gay is “wrong”), and consequences for disobeying (i.e. God will hate you and punish you). It’s all just a great way to get a large group of people to follow the same set of rules. Again, this is my perspective as an atheist and you came here to talk to atheists.

Which brings up another point - you came to talk to atheists, not Muslims. Why is that? Perhaps you are drawn to atheism the way you were drawn to Islam? Beliefs are complicated and can take a long time to work out. I explored at least five different religions before I landed on atheism, and it took me well over a decade to get there. There are no rules in atheism, no set belief system, no strict judgements for any particular lifestyle. I have found it to be freeing in a way that no religion could be. It is something to consider. If you feel confident there is a God or God-like entity, there is always agnosticism. 

I hope you find a way to love yourself and be happy. Life is short, and you deserve to enjoy it."
DebateAnAtheist,fmourw7,t1_fmjjzkl,1586268882.0,"So take your same amount of conviction, research, personal experience, time spent in your beliefs, etc. and imagine that it was applied to atheism instead. That is why I left the faith. I’ve spent close to fifteen years learning about different faiths and religions, which has lead me to believe that Christianity is just as made up as all the rest of them - an attempt by man to make sense of things that are confusing about our world (and the willingness of a group of people to believe one man - Jesus - over all of the other people who have claimed to be prophets/messiahs). I have had experiences outside of Christianity over and over again that confirm for me that my non-belief is the correct path. Christianity is only about 2,000 years old, and belief in God only a few thousand years older than that. Paganism is far, far older and perhaps the oldest “religion” so if I were going to pick one, that would likely be it. I believe in science, which has created a lot of discrepancies for Christianity to answer for (dinosaurs, the age of the planet and universe, an explanation for the beginning of all things...to name a few). There is also a lot of psychological science that supports the idea that you are brainwashed, and any anecdotal evidence is also a result of similar brainwashing. Huge groups of people throughout history never had any Christian-based religious experiences like the one you had until missionaries came and preached to them. If God/Christianity were true, you’d think that at least some people all around the world would have felt his presence independently, but instead they were all developing their own belief systems that they felt, with just as much confidence as you, were true.

I really could go on and on about why I am an atheist now, but it won’t matter to you really because, as you have said, your belief system has a fail-safe for that. If anyone leaves the faith it just means they weren’t a good enough Christian to begin with, right? So that is the endless circle of debate I was referring to before. We won’t learn anything from one another because we’ve both already got answers for anything the other could say."
DebateAnAtheist,fmjj0rt,t1_fmji4zx,1586131290.0,The best way I can answer that is by asking you a question: How confident are you that Islam is not the one true religion? Why do you believe that Christianity is the only one that is correct?

The subject that you initially responded to was whether people who have religion as individuals are potentially happier than those who don’t. You answered that you are happier with your religion. So, perhaps YOU should define happiness, since that is how this whole conversation started. If you don’t think happiness is important, then why bother responding to the post?

For me, happiness is important because it seems to be one of the most positive aspects of being alive. Our survival tends to revolve around happiness. When you meet basic needs, like eating, exercising, or having human contact, your body produces endorphins that cause feelings of happiness. It would seem that the better one is at surviving, the happier one will be. Since survival is essentially the meaning of life, successful survival creates happiness. Therefore happiness seems to be one way of individually gauging successful survival. I could also posit that the happier we are as humans, the better we function together in groups, which also seems to be essential to our survival. It would appear that happiness is a healthy lifelong goal to pursue."

But what you’ve said also isn’t entirely true, either. It won’t matter to *me,* but it will matter to anyone who was impacted by my life. My dad has been dead for 11 years but my time spent with him still matters to me all the time. It matters to my brother and my sister and my mom. I have to assume that my life will have mattered because of the impact I have had on my husband and my children, should any of them be alive when my time comes. I mean, I gave my children their lives, thus continuing a chain of lives, so inherently my life matters to them simply because they wouldn’t exist without me (and my husband). 

People can definitely have meaning and value in their lives without God, but that creates a catch-22 for you because your belief system teaches that this is an impossibility. So, if you believe me, that without God my life can matter, you are going against your religion. Thus, you have to convince yourself that there is no way my life matters, as an atheist, no matter how much I argue that it does, in fact, matter.

UnresolvedMysteries,fmf4aj9,t3_fuitx8,1586019644.0,"So, I can see how someone would have been able to get her from the tent if her dad and sister were heavy sleepers. My husband and son both sleep so heavily that I have to shout and shake them to get them awake, and I often do laundry and watch TV in the room when they are sleeping. I think it is totally possible that anyone could have taken the little girl if her dad and sister slept anything like my family.

I’m also curious about where everyone else was during the night. Who was awake and who was asleep? Where were they? There was a mention of security - where were they posted? Were there any unguarded entrances/exits? It seems like, from the photos, it was a sort of open area with hammocks and a tent, so how hard would it be for a stranger to sneak in and take a sleeping girl? Also, how prominent was this home on the beach? Was it very private or could anyone sort of wander up to it? Did people know who owned the property? Did anyone outside the family know that the granddaughters would be staying there that night, or were there any suspicious observers who may have seen them come into the location? 

There probably aren’t answers for those last few questions. I tend to think it was someone staying there who waited for nightfall and then took an opportunity. I wonder if the girls had stayed with their father and/or grandfather without their mother’s supervision before? If so, that would make me think that one or more of the employees might be responsible.

What if the majority of people were told from a young age that, when you die, you’ll fade into a blissful nothingness and that it will be wonderful? I think that if society as a whole (or at least a majority of people in society) were atheistic and also taught that it provides a great deal of peace and happiness, people would be perfectly fine with atheism. If people were raised believing that nothing happens when you die and that it is something wonderful to look forward to, they’d be happy about it.

AskWomen,fm9wavc,t3_ftjv8d,1585878021.0,"So what you are referring to could be a few different things. I think it depends on your definition of “feeling down.”

You’ve probably seen a lot of comments already about how introverts deal with spending time with other people. I’ve definitely had the experience of feeling mentally exhausted and needing to rest and be alone after spending time with a lot of people, or even with just a few very overwhelming people. It does not make me feel sad, angry, depressed, or anything like that - just tired. If I weren’t able to rest and had to keep being around people, the tiredness might make me a little irritable. I’ve learned with age how to express my own limits and stick to them, now. 

I’ve also had experiences with specific people who always made me feel stressed or depressed after spending time with them, and I’ve come to discover that those people are what most people mean when they say someone is “toxic.” I had a friend/roommate who would constantly make hateful comments about anything or anyone while we spent time together and afterwards I would feel sad and drained. I had another acquaintance who would only ever talk about her illnesses and would always bring the conversation back to the topic of how sick she was - also draining and depressing.

askwomenadvice,flu64no,t3_fr0kec,1585496053.0,"So, first of all you need to realize that things have been this way for awhile and your SO is not going to suddenly change because you asked him to. These habits are set for him and habits are hard to break. Getting frustrated with him, while totally understandable, won’t make him change any faster. It sucks, but now that your schedules have changed it doesn’t mean he will rise to the occasion. 

You’ve got 3 options, basically: 1) accept that he is this way and may never change, which means you’ll be in charge of meals and shopping for the rest of your relationship; 2) break up with him because the effort of working through this problem or trying to accept him as-is is more than you can handle; 3)put a lot of effort into patiently working with him on setting boundaries and raising expectations. 

I’ve chosen all of these options at some point in my life and relationship, but I’ll only advise for #3, since that one seems to be the path you’ve already chosen. The hardest part is that you need to try to separate from your anger and be incredibly patient. You are allowed to express how you feel and what you expect, but you’ll also have to calmly repeat your expectations over and over for him to learn yo change his habits. You’ll probably have to sot down and teach him skills, too, which will make you feel like a parent; but, keep in mind that a benefit of relationships is learning skills from one another so that you can grow as a person. 

Here are some talking points that I would use with him:

“I’m really proud of you for going to school and I know how hard it is to try to juggle everything. That being said, I’m not going to help you with your schoolwork anymore. I need to focus on my own priorities and it stresses me out when you ask me for help last minute. I know you’ll be able to find resources to help you succeed.”

When he inevitably asks for help: “Remember, I said I wasn’t going to help you anymore. I love you and I know you can manage it without my help.”

“I am feeling really overwhelmed with always being the one to cook food and go shopping. I need you to start cooking two dinners a week, every week. I’d be happy to help you come up with ideas for meals and make a shopping list so that you’ll know what to buy at the store.” (Expect him to make mistakes and make some bad meals - he probably has not had to do this before.)

“I’d really like your help shopping and preparing meals. Next time we go to the store, we can split the list and you’ll help me shop. When I am cooking, I want you to help me and I can show you how to make some of my favorite meals.”


At this point you probably get the idea. Be clear and a little bit bossy, but not angry. Just state it as a non-negotiable expectation and then drop it. Rinse and repeat. Either he’ll get it or he won’t and then you’ll be back at this point having to decide what to do again."

Some people will fully support the choice you’ve made and others will be mean, oftentimes surprising you, and you’ll have to learn a new set of coping skills to deal with the mean ones. When you look in the mirror, the reflection will be different and you’ll have to develop new ways of appreciating that reflection. No matter what, whether you immediately start to grow your hair out or you keep short hair forevermore, you’ll have learned things about yourself that will help you grow as a person."

AttachmentParenting,flsgy0x,t1_flqsm24,1585441882.0,"So we started night-weaning at 18 months because I was in the same boat as you. I hadn’t slept through the night in a year and a half and it showed. I read the book “The No-Cry Sleep Solution” which helped us a lot with getting our son to sleep in general, not with night-weaning. We also got books to read to him that were specifically about night-weaning and started reading them a couple of weeks before I started the process. 

When it was time to start, I would nurse him to sleep and then pick a specific time in the morning when he could nurse again (I think it was 5am). I made my phone alarm be a happy song (I wanna say it was something by ABBA) so that when we heard the song we knew it was ok to nurse again. During the first week it was hard because he would ask to nurse and was, of course, sad when I said that mommy’s boobies were sleeping and we had to let them get sleep at night. I also had my husband there to help with comforting. Each night was progressively easier than the one before and we would reward him a lot during the day, too, talking about how big he was for being able to sleep through the night.

Now with baby #2 I have no f$$ks left to give and have learned not to share my baby-rearing habits with others. Still, that did not stop a well-meaning friend from telling me, unprompted, that she had both of her kids sleeping through the night at 8 weeks because of sleep-training and would be ordering me the book she had read.

unpopularopinion,fk860mk,t3_fgx6z2,1583950017.0,"So I have personal stories on this subject, but I want to be clear that I was only sexually assaulted, not raped. Rape is more serious and more damaging than what happened to me, to be sure. I just wanted to share my perspective.

When I was about 4 years old I was molested by a family member of the same age. It definitely affected me, but nobody had ever taught me how to tell anyone about things like bad touch, so I was just confused about the encounter for years. In middle school we had a program/workshop thing where we all learned about molestation and sexual assault and things like that, and it was the first time I realized that something bad had happened to me. I told the guidance counselor, who took me seriously but only ever talked to me about it that one time. She called my parents and spoke to my dad, leaving it up to him to handle. Because it happened with someone who was also a child, there was no action to be taken, and my dad basically gave me a “kids will be kids” talk and never touched the subject again. My parents easily could have gotten me therapy or counseling to work through the discomfort I was feeling, but they didn’t, so what I took away from the experience was that it was ok for someone to sexually molest me if they were young/naive/a peer. 

In high school, I ended up with a boyfriend who pressured me a lot when it came to sexual activity. I willingly engaged in some things, but then he would regularly take advantage of those situations and go further than I wanted, or do things even though I said “no.” We were both minors, and so I had already learned that nothing would happen to him if I reported his behavior. I had also learned that telling a trusted adult would result in a call to my parents and, again, nothing happening. I did finally confide in a friend, who basically said that it was my fault that I was being abused because I was allowing some things to happen (like making out) before my boyfriend would go further than I wanted (like taking off my clothes). As a result, I stayed involved with this boyfriend for years, letting him basically do whatever he wanted to me and feeling horrible guilt the whole time because I thought I had invited the behavior. I also came to think I deserved nothing better and did not seek to change the situation until I made friends with a wonderful person who helped me see what was really going on. Looking back, I can see that my boyfriend was already a sexual predator at a young age and reporting him might have at least helped to keep him from doing it to someone else later, even if nothing came of it. I’m mature enough now to understand what I should have done then, but at ages 14-16 I really did not understand my options or how to handle what was happening to me. I’ve never spoken openly about what he did except to a few close friends and my husband.

So basically what I am saying is that it is incredibly complicated to be a victim of sexual assault. Many rapes are not cut-and-dry situations where a person is sober and loudly expressing non-consent. Rapists tend to look for situations where they can take advantage of someone, like when another person has been drinking. People who are already in a relationship or even married can be raped by their partner, someone they’ve already had consenting sex with many times. Sometimes people consent and then change their minds, creating confusion. Of course, in no way does this ever excuse the rapist, but it certainly makes it a challenge for the person who was raped to make their case. On top of this, we are talking about a person who has been through something thoroughly traumatizing, and trauma can make people behave in ways that they normally would not. The human mind tends to want to run from any memory of the trauma, so for a person to instead face that memory head-on and recount it over and over to other people can be an absolutely horrific experience, one which takes great mental strength and resolve. For some people it can take years or even decades to face that trauma."

For context, my husband and I have our own property management business together. We own two trailer parks and get all of our income from rent money. I have been a SAHM for several years now, so my involvement in the parks varies a lot, while my husband generally works 5 days a week on them, mostly repairs and upkeep. He is free to make whatever financial decisions he feels necessary to keep the parks running, be that hiring people to do specialty work or buying supplies and/or tools needed, etc. Even when I am at home all the time (like right now because I just had another baby and daycare won’t be an option for awhile) I still pay bills, write receipts for rent, keep track of expenses for our taxes, and update our various budgets. Also, my husband has several credit cards that he is responsible for, but he also regularly lets me know the balances and monthly payments for those (and he is very responsible with them). We always check with each other before making any purchases over $100, and we also take personal allowances for ourselves of around $100-$200 a month each, depending on the month. Having a business together definitely makes it imperative that we be totally open with each other about finances, but it also makes our marriage much easier when we know exactly what to expect with our finances each month. All of our accounts are joint accounts and there are never any surprises. We are able to trust each other to protect our monetary assets, which is a big part of having a functional relationship."

Finally, I had had enough. We were about to go on a trip to visit family, so I made a list of very simple things he needed to do that week for me to stay with him. It was stuff like doing his laundry to have clean clothes for the trip, wash his dirty dishes before we left, etc. Really easy, simple tasks. I thought for sure that he’d do them, knowing that our relationship was at stake. Instead, he played video games until a few hours before we had to leave and then frantically tried to pack for the trip. On the trip I was cold to him the whole time (but avoided drama so that I could enjoy time with family), but he truly did not notice or even care that he hadn’t done the few things I’d asked. Once we got back from the trip, I dumped him immediately, much to his surprise, and went to go stay with a friend.

askwomenadvice,fk18k8c,t1_fk0r2i0,1583774592.0,"I can see how that would catch you off guard and come as a surprise. Sometimes people say things at the wrong time and it puts you on the spot, trying to figure out how to react. This may just be how he communicates things at this stage in his life, especially after he’s had a few beers. My husband has definitely done the same thing to me and it has taken me awhile to learn how to respond in those situations. I’d still say you’re probably better off waiting until the next day to bring things like that up since it seems like alcohol can make him feel more defensive than usual. Perhaps over coffee the next morning you could say something like, “maybe it was the beers talking, but do you really want kids now? I was just curious.” Be sure to listen and be open to discussion. His opinions may change as you guys get older and he sees more of his friends/family settling down and having kids, so sometimes he might think he wants kids now and sometimes he might think it is smarter to wait, depending on how his life is going at that time.

You guys are on the same page. You both want kids, you just don’t want them now.

He’s probably feeling upset because he wants to talk about having kids, something that you’ve likely talked with him about before, but rather than having an open discussion about it you seem to be focusing on why you guys can’t have kids *right now.* You might not be meaning to, but it seems like you’re taking a topic that is normal to bring up in a relationship that has lasted this long and also at your age, and you’re steering it in a negative direction. You guys need to have a positive conversation about having kids where you are both allowed to share your hopes and dreams without the other person bringing up ways that you aren’t ready. You could say “Hey, I know that lately I’ve been shooting down the idea of having kids because I don’t want you to have false hope that I want one anytime soon, but I’d love to talk about why you want to have kids one day. How many do you want? Do you want boys or girls?”

Also, don’t police his conversations with his friends. He should be allowed to say if he wants kids or not, and if he has been drinking that is an especially bad time to try to talk about your negative feelings. Part of a mature relationship is being able to comfortably disagree with your partner about things, even in front of other people, and not get upset or fight about it. My husband and I had dinner with some married friends last night where we all discussed whether or not we’d like more children (since I just had a baby) and everyone at the table had a different opinion, but we all were able to laugh about it. Find a way to get to that point where you can hear him say “I am wanting kids right now,” and just chuckle about it without getting upset."
cookingforbeginners,fjzscgq,t3_ffkbdv,1583727867.0,"They are two very different types of oil with different flavors and smoke points. Your dad probably isn’t lying - rapeseed (or canola, as I am familiar with it) oil has a very mild flavor. In the US, I would argue that it is just as popular as vegetable oil and used for the same kinds of recipes. It is great for frying because it has a high smoke point, which means that you can get it really hot without it smoking. All in all, it is a very versatile oil because you can use it for just about anything from frying eggs to baking a cake. The fact that it is inexpensive is a bonus.

Olive oil, on the other hand, has a very distinct flavor that is only suitable for cooking with certain savory items. You can also use it at room temperature for things like dipping bread or as a salad dressing (usually paired with vinegar) because of its strong flavor. Olive oil also has a low smoke point, so it really should not be used for frying anything, only sautéing items at a fairly low temperature. It tastes great with flavors like garlic or balsamic, but would be terrible to use as oil in a cake. On top of that, it tends to go rancid more quickly than other vegetable oils, so unless you use it often, you’d want to buy a small amount and toss it after a month or two of opening it. It is also much more expensive than other oils.

If your dad likes rapeseed/canola oil, it’s probably mostly to do with the flavor and versatility of it, because there are other oils that are just as cheap that he could be buying, olive oil not being one of them."

BipolarReddit,fjxjax2,t3_ff64lb,1583675157.0,"Your concerns are valid, and maybe it would be worth discussing with a therapist. Having kids is going to create stress (like sleep deprivation) that may exacerbate bipolar symptoms. Only you can really decide how well you think you’ll cope based on your personal experience with your illness.

That being said, my husband has bipolar I and he is an absolutely fantastic dad. We just had our second child and I can’t begin to describe how good my husband is with our kids. We take extra measures to ensure that he stays stable (for example, I do all of the nighttime baby stuff so that he can get a good night’s rest) and we are always watching out for signs of mania. Somehow, he manages to only ever take things out on me when he cycles, not our kids, and we’ve been together long enough that I know how to deal with it at this point. I would say that he makes the same mistakes that any “normal” parent does - we both sometimes lose our patience, we both have bad days, we both have to step back and ask for help. Even so, he is always patient and kind - he has never yelled at or hit our kids, he has never done anything to jeopardize their safety, and he always works hard to support our family.  He takes his meds and he goes to the doctor and he does everything he can to keep himself stable - and it shows!

So it is totally possible to have bipolar and be an amazing parent. You just have to figure out for yourself if you think you can, which is honestly no more than any person must do whether they have mental illness or not :)"

DebateAnAtheist,fjie1d5,t3_fdfk00,1583365609.0,"In my opinion, consciousness is a biological activity that can be observed, and it came from evolution.

We can monitor brain activity and literally see consciousness happening, as well as track various areas of the brain related to different aspects of consciousness. We can speculate that literal damage to the brain will cause specific changes in consciousness based on observations made in the past. We’ve collected enough data from research at this point that consciousness is not much of a mystery - it is clearly a physical part of brain activity that is somewhat unique to individuals based on their learning patterns throughout life, but also fairly consistent in some ways across entire species. For example, we can see that certain areas of the human brain relate to long-term thinking, and that damage to those parts will also damage long-term thinking. Long-term thinking can certainly be considered to be an aspect of consciousness, and it while it will vary between individuals based on their life experiences, it won’t shift itself to a completely different part of the brain.

By looking at the various species on earth and studying their brain activity, we can also see how consciousness has evolved in different ways to suit different species in ways related to their survival. Many species that appear to exhibit empathy also rely on group participation for survival of the species. So the aspect of consciousness that generates feelings of empathy is also a physical evolutionary trait that helps to keep the species alive. Not all species seem to exhibit empathy, and these other species seem to survive by *not* working as a group, so their consciousness is different but still observably a physical evolution. 

By looking at fossil records, we can see that life on earth started very simply, and consciousness was likely restricted to simple acts such as “reproduce.” Single-celled organisms had little-to-no competition at first and required simple consciousnesses. As life evolved to become more complex, so did consciousness."

missouri,fjfv7vu,t3_fd77dx,1583301242.0,"I grew up in Missouri and moved back last year after living in other states for several years, and to me ticks are very low on my list of things to worry about. There are lots of ways to prevent getting ticks on you if you think you’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors in tall grass during warm months. 

Now tornadoes, that’s what you need to be worried about."
TooAfraidToAsk,fjbznz2,t1_fjbz21r,1583205008.0,Would it not be better to deal with the pain as an adult when pain medicine can be used than as an infant when no pain medicine can be used? Knowing that it is “extremely painful” seems like a good reason not to circumcise a baby.
TooAfraidToAsk,fjbzjob,t1_fjbl13q,1583204928.0,That depends a lot on the circumstances. My dad chose to get circumcised as an adult for non-medical reasons and was actually appreciative that he was given the choice to do so. Every individual is going to be different.
