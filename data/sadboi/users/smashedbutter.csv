However, I can say that there isn't much information regarding this issue as neuro studies are limited to lab situations and language occurs in the whole brain (in particular disseminated areas). There is much to do in the field, and just now there are more interdisciplinary professionals (we either have biologists who know little about linguistics, or linguists who can't read a fMRI!) 


The theories related to language learning are a completely different issue. Fun fact, when talking to a person your brain tries to ""imitate"" the same frequency and brain wave. Then, of course, being in the country or in contact with people who speak the language is essential.


Uhm, about the age, there's a theory about the ""critical period"". Basically, children achieve better pronunciation because as you get old your brain tends to economy, i.e. it ignores the sounds it does not use. However, the brain has also shown to be incredibly flexible and adaptative, then old people at any age can achieve any level of fluency (if they are trained in phonology, most can achieve native-like sounds (its not like that matters anyway! lol))"
asklinguistics,ezxm72t,t3_d2xk3k,1568243932.0,"Being bilingual or + mostly makes your grey matter denser, as it's similar to ""exercising"". Musicians also have shown these differences in the brain.


When I say exercise I mean the following: when you speak several languages, they are available for your brain to choose. Most of the time, the language being learnt is ""more available"" than the mother tongue, because it requires more energy to remember (think of the mother tongue as ""taken for granted"" and left aside from time to time). Then, phenomena like ""slips"" and mixing languages are related to the system that was more active at the moment when you speak. The fact that languages mix only shows the flexibility of the brain to choose the fastest term available (remember that all brain processes tend to economy)


I hope this was useful! Cheers!"
asklinguistics,ezw47ei,t3_d2guij,1568207436.0,"As the others have said, probably* no. Language is the bridge between your cognitive reality and the concrete reality, that's why it seems like Sapir-Whorf (but children can follow commands without speaking - or ""think"" without a fully developed language).


What does happen is that you have a different array of tools to represent reality, but that does not limit it or change it. (as the words to describe ice).


There are some other old fashioned theories like contrastive rhetorics, that say the language shapes how messages are conveyed (romance languages are recursive, English is straightforward, Arabic is like a two way streets). Anyway, this hasn't been proven and it may be more related to culture than the system itself.
