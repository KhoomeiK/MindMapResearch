Having all this free time in querentine  really made me realize how much social media was affecting me, I didn't realize just how much I was comparing myself to others. I did a big overhaul on all my social media accounts just a couple nights ago. I unfollowed the show-off celebrities and other annoying people who brag and started following visual artists, natural geographic and other nature photography accounts, positive affirmation and wellness accounts etc. My feeds are now cluttered with pictures of natural landscapes, cool animals, art, and sunsets. I have been feeling way more relaxed these oast few days since doing this."

spirituality,flk1x17,t1_fljys4r,1585232167.0,"Thank you and you're very welcome ! It is normal to feel negative sometimes but it isn't normal to have it be your default emotion all the time that it makes you think life is not worth living.

Statistically there is only 1 in 400 trillion chance of being born a human being on planet earth. It's almost impossible and yet here you are ! That's a miracle in itself and cannot be pointless. You're life has value, it has a purpose.

I would high reccomend researching chakras and how to clear them, guided meditation, visualization/possitive affirmation and journaling. I was in your place once and I think these tools can really help you. 

I really wish you all the best OP, I will think of you today while meditating and send some light your way. Get well soon and feel free to ask me about any of the tools that I mentioned."
spirituality,fljx1xr,t3_fp9sez,1585228879.0,"I can relate to the trapped feeling. I have been dealing with it for many years. I wake up, get ready, sit in a cubicle for 8 hours doing mindless tasks I hate that make someone else richer, go home exhausted to do anything else, eat ,sleep, wake up and repeat forever until I die. Any spare time was spent doing chores and errands and entertaining friends/guests. I really felt that that was it, this is what life is. Bland, boring, pointless. 

This repetitive cycle I was in and having no higher purpose was depressing. It wore me down so much it manifested physically. I suffered chronic pain that was debilitating I could barely walk some days, severe brain fog that made even simple tasks difficult (like holding a conversation), daily tension headaches, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, and migraines so bad I would physically vommit. I went to doctors after doctor being told nothing is wrong with me, i need to get out more (which i tried doing, i would schedule plans back to back every weekend with friends...nothing changed. I would feel happy out with friends in that moment but as soon as it was over back to that suffocating trapped feeling all over again). 

I eventually reached a breaking point and was ready to check out permantly. I expressed these feelings to a family member and they happened to be deep into spirituality/new age stuff. They taught me about meditation, I cancelled all social commitments and let everyone in my circle know I would not be accepting any invitations to anything for any reason for the next couple months as I am focussing on my health. I focused solely on clearing chakras and meditating on figuring out what is ""trapping me"" and figuring out what actually makes me happy with out the distraction of other's opinions or expectstions. Just me and God/Source/Universe/Spirit (whatever you want to call it, don't let religion limit you their is more to the devine than some man in the sky with a beard that makes rules and punishes), I wrote some of it down after meditation and I am slowly mapping what I want to my life to actually look like and slowly working towards it.

The law of attraction is not some supernatural thing (at least for me it isn't), it's more of a visualisation and affirmation tool that helps you get excited and have the energy to work towards what you want. If you can visualize and tell yourself what you want in more detail you will have the drive to strive for it (top olympic athletes even use this strategy so there is something to it) 

I noticed since I began all this, I dont have that suffocating trapped feeling as much anymore,  my physical symptoms have dwindled and I look forward to my future because I know what I am working towards and coming closer to finding peace and purpose. The ""im trapped"" feeling still comes back from time-to-time but through meditation and affirmation I am able to silence those thoughts."
