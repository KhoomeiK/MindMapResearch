zines,fj9e8q6,t3_fca2c2,1583144487.0,"\#MoZiPro is the abbreviated name of **That Monthly Zine Project.** The idea is that there's a theme every month & you make a zine inspired by or related to the theme (it can be as off the wall as you want, and any zine format is allowed!)

There is [a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mozipro/) and [an Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/mozipro/) to check out. 

**Here are my own ideas so far for this month to give you an idea of how broad the scope is (I was just brainstorming):**

\- bees & how I'm a beekeeper (perzine) (how-to, educational zine)  
\- an unedited account of everything I can remember from high school biology class, with illustrations (perzine)  
\- the science of making hand salve using beeswax & natural oils (how-to, educational zine)  
\- how film cameras work (I actually have no idea and I'm a film photographer! So, an account of how I think they work & how they actually work) (perzine)  
\- how ears work & my personal experience of being Hard of Hearing (perzine)  
\- a pulp-style, unedited, 'crazy scientist' story (creative writing)  
\- how the phases of the moon work with the tides (how-to, educational zine)  
\- the science behind ceramic glazes - it's way more complicated than I thought! (perzine)"
