That experience can lead to significant PTSD.  People who go through a long stretch on a vent can have a long recovery path, and often can't work for 6-12 months.  They need assistance at home during that time, and possible rehabilitation.

RationalPsychonaut,fm1t3bm,t3_fsjp6s,1585684515.0,"A key component of conscious use of psychedelics is to set an intention.  While it is not guaranteed, a clear intention can sometimes lead to psychedelic experiences that are relevant to that intention.  For example, if you have depression, PTSD, or addiction, you might start by setting an intention around healing in relation to those challenges.  Now, some of what might happen is that you have powerful experiences that are a bit like dreams and need to be explored and understand in terms of how they might help you in that healing process.  There are also potential neurological impacts that occur, irrespective of the specific experience, that promote healing (explore the idea of neuroplasticity).

Each person will have a unique experience with each trip they take, and you can't force a specific experience to occur.  While intention is important, you need to stay open to what unfolds for you, and following the experience, engage in what is called ""integration"", which involves, in part, making sense of the experience, developing insights and turn those into something actionable that brings benefit to your life.

Psychonaut,flz9gb8,t1_flw9idu,1585618485.0,">  which is a practice that can be achieved just as deeply through kinds of meditation

Is a part of the case you're making that psychedelics are a less integral or valid pathway to insight than meditation?  Are you saying meditation is more ""natural"" than psychedelics?  There's cultures where psychedelic plant medicine has probably been being used for millennia, in a way that is essential to their individual and cultural experience.  I hardly think meditation is in any way more valid, more ""empirical"" or more sustainable than those practices.  

> scientifically reform

I think you and I may have different ideas of what constitutes ""science"".  To me it is a very formal practice for creating knowledge, and very different from practices of mediation.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your usage.

A few examples of ""integration"" for me as a result of recent journeys.

I had an experience recently with a shaman present where I was certain I was going to die, that night, during the trip.  I was not very afraid, but I was reluctant to go.  I found myself negotiating for just a little more time - time enough to eat one more blackberry, a little more time to pet my dogs, one more song to dance to.  I felt some sadness and regret that I hadn't found a good home for my dogs once I'm gone.  At the end of the night, I was utterly blown away that in fact I was not going to die and I would be around the next day.

So that was the experience.  The integration is recognizing my fearlessness about death (I've been working on that for quite some time).  It is recognizing my reluctance to go as a deep affirmation of this experience of life, inhabiting this reality.  Recognizing the value of the simplest pleasures, like a single blackberry in my mouth.  In contrast, I was not negotiating for just another hour on Reddit.  A very actionable insight was just how important it is for me to find a home for my dogs.  I don't want to be dying on a ventilator with my last thought being that I'm sorry I didn't find a home for my pups.  And finally, what a fucking gift being alive is! 

These are hugely important lessons.  Perhaps the most significant work of using psychedelics in a meaningful and conscious way is integrate them into your life in a way that is sustainable and actionable.  Not always easy to do, especially for beginners, to really make sense of the experience so you receive a meaningful message, and then to bring that into your everyday practices."

I think the trip helped me identify that spot and I'm really feeling better aligned now."
Psychonaut,flv9a1u,t3_fr7rpr,1585519044.0,"Interesting and subtle ideas.  Thanks for sharing them.

Here are my thoughts - I apologize in advance if I'm misconstruing your points in my response.  I think I mostly understood you but I'm not completely sure.

It seems to me that to some degree you're implying that integration has a minimal role in the psychedelic experience, that it is a misguided effort, even ""pathological"" insofar as people might embrace their ""truth"".  

To me, the journey itself is wonderful and should be honored for what it is as separate from the everyday consensus reality we inhabit, during the time we are having it especially.  But for me the real fruit of the experience is what we take from it and bring into everyday life as insight, sometimes with radically transformative possibilities.  Some of that work of that integration can/is done by relating to an ineffable experience as such, without language-based cognition or communication.  We integrate it on more subtle level of consciousness.  But part of it is also doing our best, knowing that the essential experience is ineffable, to push the envelope with language to attempt to express it, however imperfectly.  Those kinds of integrated insights can be life transforming, the kinds of things we actually put into action in our lives.  

I'd love to hear your views on integration, not in terms of the potential pitfalls, but in terms of an approach that is most skillful in leveraging the psychedelic experience into our lives."

spirituality,flquidd,t3_fqezih,1585406509.0,"The entire collective is stressed, uncertain, and dealing with fear, and in the case of people who are sick or on the front line, sheer terror and some measure of powerlessness.  People are dealing with loss and grief.  People don't know how they will pay their bills.  

But those experiences are not depression, and I don't think that for the collective it is depression, certainly not as it is commonly clinically defined.  Actually, many people are taking courageous action in their communities, and that seldom indicates depression, which is very much about motivation and energy.

With real depression (and I'm not sure what Foster discusses is more than a general malaise and sadness - he calls it melancholy, which is different from depression) there is a profound lack of motivation to do anything.  This is the catch-22 with depression, that the things that might help the depressed person break out are the things most difficult to do when you're depressed.  Exercise, eating better, bathing, connecting with people, meaningful work, volunteering, etc.  The same goes for developing a spiritual outlook or practice - it's extraordinary hard for people without depression to do, much less for someone overwhelmed by purposelessness and hopelessness.

I recently escaped a two year long depression with significant suicidal ideation.  In my case, it turned out that it was in fact a spiritual crisis of sorts that was, in part, underlying my depression.  I don't think that is true in all cases of depression.  I managed to break up the spiritual ice through the use of psychedelics, used in a conscious and careful way.  It was the catalyst for the change, and I do think a significant catalyst is required to break out of depressions that have a basis in spiritual emergency, and that could be other things, including something like life threatening illness."

In a certain sense, the impulse to be sexual can act as your signal to redirect your energies into more subtle forms of body pleasure, that may somewhat satisfy the urge.  Just start listening to those impulses and use them as your reminder.  

I totally respect your goal of coping with frustration by redirecting your sexual impulses.  I suggested it because in part I'm in a similar situation.  But I hope for neither of us does it represent closing the door on sex forever!  I think in some times in our life, it's good to pull our energies in and direct them toward self-care, but recognize that life is flow, and things can change.

The other aspect of this for me is trying to disrupt the duality of sexual versus non-sexual relationships, and instead seeing the way I relate to women as potentially being more amorphous and not fitting into traditional categories.  An example of this (and this is not something I have found) would be to have a cuddle buddy where the boundaries excluding sexual activity are well-defined.

Sometimes people have spiritually transformative experiences when there is a pandemic and they open their heart to the whole situation of suffering and survival, and maybe even start taking action in their community, in a practice of love and compassion.

So for me, practicing non-attachment is trying to be appreciative with the friendship is intense, including recognizing that it is unknown when it will end.  Knowing it may end actually enhances my enjoyment while it exists because it becomes more precious.  

And now that my new friend seems to be withdrawing, I'm filling my heart with good wishes for them, and gratitude for all the interesting conversation and learning that happened.  It was a gift that they entered my life for a short time, and releasing the friendship now is something I can do with freedom and ease.  

I don't know if that's the perfect example of practicing non-attachment, it's just what's going on with me today!"

If I'm depressed, and feeling ugly, I think I give that energy off and people respond in kind, with a decreased likelihood of engaging with me, making eye-contact and smiling, which serves to function as confirmation of my ugliness, and makes me more certain I am not an attractive person.  It's a vicious cycle.

When I'm feeling up, and radiating self-assuredness, and I feel like I look good, I simply smile more in an authentic way at people, I get more kindness and smiles back, which deepens my sense of my own attractiveness (by which I don't mean only sexual attractiveness, but also just in terms of being a compelling person).

I feel a great affinity with it right now but don't have the deep knowledge of it's scriptures such that I could not answer your question in terms of that framework.  I don't know too much Rumi, but I've heard it said there are some interesting parallels.

What I take from that perspective in terms of my own beliefs, based on my own experiences with yoga, everyday life and psychedlics, is a non-dual perspective that we are all a part of a single oceanic consciousness, and that our individual consciousness is sort of wave on that ocean expressing itself through love and play.  Because I see all consciousness as one, and I have a very playful and freedom-oriented perspective on things, I have an easy time viewing other religions or individual spiritual paths as each being utterly valid.  It is all about consciousness, and so any given belief system is an instrument to get toward the ultimate, what I call God.  I also see things like drama, poetry, music, dance, cooking, science, etc. as  being powerful pathways toward the divine (both in terms of performing those practices but also being on the receiving end)."

First and foremost, take a deep breath, and let out some of the nervousness and anxiety.

You have a problem with your digestive system *right now*.  This is something you know because of physical symptoms, perhaps - it is in the present.  Spinning out thoughts and scenarios about the future simply detach you from the present moment, and do not serve your well-being.  They are simply not true.  They have not happened yet.

When you bring into consciousness the way that those future-oriented thoughts are truly undermining you by creating anxiety and stress, you may be able to let go of your focus on what might come up next, and find yourself returned to what you do know.

Seek out an opportunity to freely show love and compassion to others.  Activate your heart.  The simplest and most immediate way is to find volunteer opportunity where you can connect with and serve others.  There is something quite magical in the connection you form when doing service work, and the good energy that comes back you can truly fill your heart, and help you recognize the deep reservoir of goodness and love in your soul.  

When you tap into that abundant love, you can redirect some of it to yourself, and then you start being your own best friend.

One of the things that being bipolar has taught me about my relationship to my physical looks is that my current energy/mood state has a dramatic impact on what I perceive and notice in the mirror.  

When I'm depressed, simply put, I look very ugly to myself, unattractive.  I focus on all the features that are not attractive, and ignore the rest.  Perception of ugliness actually makes my depression worse, so it's a vicious cycle.  Despair over my looks has gone so far as to contribute to suicidal thinking.

When I enter a higher mood state, especially full-on hypomania, it's like I see a different person in the mirror. The glow I have overcomes the specific perceived flaws. And that contributes to how I move through world with greater confidence and greater indifference to my physical appearance.  I believe those things in turn make me much more attractive.

One more point on the issue of coming terms with one's physical attractiveness.  I have gotten much more comfortable *talking* about being ""ugly"", and even disclosing to people the list of specific physical aspects that contribute to my perception of myself as ugly.  Talking about it with strangers on Reddit has helped, and talking about it face-to-face has helped even more.  The key is that, for me, it defuses some of the wretched feelings that go with it, and enables me to be more centered and grounded in my physical presence and appearance."

One of the things that I've learned is that you can't stumble into the way you ask for help.  Being effective and graceful at it is a skill you can develop - it requires being thoughtful in your approach and sensitive in your interaction.  Do a Google search on ""how to ask for help"" and look there for some ideas on how you can do it better.

One of the really good and reassuring things about asking for and receiving help is that it can feel really good for the other person to give you support.  It feels good to help somebody!  And there are things you can say and do that will make someone feel good about listening to you and providing feedback.  

One is to receive advice in a comfortable way.  Often times we get frustrated if someone tries to give us advice that doesn't seem to match our situation or needs.

Like you I think, I do believe our bodies house our soul for the period of time we are embodied.  But for me, it is more than a vessel (I still think that is a beautiful way of putting it).  

My core spiritual practice is through moving with my body, sort of a hybrid of yoga and ecstatic dance.  In this sense, my body is a wondrous instrument that brings me closer to God (for me, a supreme consciousness which we are part of).

MDMA,fj46xao,t1_fj45tgy,1583001670.0,"Not true in a number of respects.

I agree that medical interventions are very limited.  And you're basically describing a situation where there's mild injuries, non-acute, still respiratory sufficiency, perhaps with O2 therapy, a key part of the treatment regimen for any respiratory crisis you left out.  

However, if the person is suffering from respiratory insufficiency, particularly because of small airway injury, they'll treat with BiPaP, and if that's insufficient, intubate.  

Many of those with the still-somewhat mysterious injuries caused by vaping had to be put on a ventilator to provide sufficient support for healing to take place, which in some cases did not occur, resulting in permanent loss of lung function.  I believe with the vaping injuries, the only medical therapy was steroids, along with ventilatory support.  I know in at least once case, the irreversible loss of lung function was enough to require an emergency lung transplant.

Smoking MDMA when the oral route is quite enough to provide everything MDMA can offer is just a terrible idea."

Your nervousness combined with what I think are poor choices regarding setting, especially given your past experience, is the opposite of the kind of safe and support environment you would benefit from.  When I was younger I had a number of trips with people who were new to psychedelics, and three times I ended up dealing with someone having a really rough time.  Given your history, you could easily be drawn into their difficulties.

If you have ""PTSD"" from your last trip, with is a pretty heavy way to be seeing it, I strongly encourage you to do some serious integration work before you start taking new journeys.  Given the intensity of your experience, if you can find a therapist or guide who has experience working with people around psychedelic expediencies, that would be the best approach.

In other words, the health impact is not well understood.  I bet ER doctors would be pretty baffled about how to treat you if you arrived with MDMA induced lung injury.  You may wind up on a ventilator until your lungs can heal, if they even do.

Treasure your lungs.  I had to have a double lung transplant, so I'm very attuned to their fragility and  the importance of those magical organs."
mentalhealth,fj40jip,t1_fj3tsc2,1582997482.0,"I think you are over-estimating the ""damage"" you are doing to resources and people just by being who you are.  That suggests that resources are scarce and that other people are less resilient than they really are.  Resources are abundant.  People are resilient, and while perhaps you might make people frustrated and angry or sad at times, those are just the experiences all people go through.  You can truly become a person who spreads love and compassion and joy - that is within your essential capabilities as a person.  

I don't put too much stock in hobbies to improve one's life.  They can be great connecting you to others who share the interest, and diverting from your problems, but often are not interesting to people who are not into the hobby.  I'm going to propose that there is something much more attractive and compelling to other people, something more interesting than being ""interesting"".

It's not for everyone, but volunteering has had a huge impact on my well-being.  I visit a pediatric oncology ward with my little dog Digit, to give animal love to kids, their parents and the health care professionals who care for them.

It gets me out of the house, which I think is key when I'm depressed.  It gets me out of my own head, and getting to know other people who I can serve with my love and care, so I'm not thinking about my problems as much.  I find that in giving love and support to people, it is not a drain at all but in fact I get so much in return, in terms of receiving love and gratitude from them.  And in terms of sharing the story of my work with other people, it is interesting to them, but more importantly it conveys to them one of the best attributes a person can have: kindness.  In other words, being kind is more important to people worth being friends with than being interesting.  

It is not the case that you have no potential.  It is not the case that you have some potential.  It is in fact the case that you have infinite potential.  You may not be able to become a rocket scientist or a rock star, but the kind of potential I'm talking about - developing self-love, giving love to others, receiving love, spreading joy, practicing compassion - these are bottomless in the degree to which you can deepen your capabilities.  Infinite potential.   

By committing suicide you would be depriving the world of considerable potential love and light.  Please don't take your beautiful self away from us.  We need good people in this world desperately."
mentalhealth,fj3tcsx,t3_fbe8gb,1582992753.0,"I was suicidal recently and it involved a lot of the same thoughts you describe.  If you look at checklists of warning signs or symptoms, your post reads like a laundry list: hopelessness, self-hatred, shame, failed relationships, social isolation.  

For me, those thoughts and feelings were interlocking, so that my hopelessness kept me from thinking that I could do better in my relationships, which in turn increased my social isolation and self-hatred and shame.  

Hopelessness was underpinning everything else, because with hope, you can see the possibilities for improvement and healing in all the other negative stuff.  None of it seems permanent or insurmountable.  

If you're anything like me, you feel like your hopelessness is rational based on your experience up until now in your life.  I was 53 when I was last suicidal so I probably had a lot more past ""evidence"" for my hopelessness than you have.  And yet, I got through it, and once I was through it looking back I see the period of suicidal thinking and the hopelessness like a thick cloud that had descended on me, a kind of echo chamber of despair and the interlocking, self-confirming beliefs I mentioned above.

I don't have a magic pill to give you hope.  The best I can offer is that in my experience, complete hopelessness is as irrational and useless as hope untempered by realism.  When you begin to let some hope into your life, the interlocking trap of negative thinking begins to unravel, and your individual path to survival starts to be revealed.

I think there are many good reasons to advocate for med compliance, but I don't think this particular argument is well-founded.

I did a little research on progression and it seems progression is linked to continued episodes.  If that's the case, it is remission that prevents progression, rather than being a direct impact of medication.  Put differently, mediations do not prevent progression, rather they contribute to remission, which in turn slows progression.  

If someone takes another therapeutic approach that doesn't involve medical mood stabilizers, and achieves remission, the benefit might well be the same.  So the claim that medications are the *only* path to prevent progression does not seem well-founded."
