transhumanism,foroair,t1_fornbt1,1588015619.0,"Mu. I wasn't saying you had the capacity to mind in death. Let's quote you exactly, for the education of anyone who reads this, as TechnoL33T has officially exited the argument. Suicidal ideation, under the definition my therapist uses and my previous mental hospital used, is the belief that death, or non-existence, (depending obviously on your theophilosophical worldview, these may or may not be one and the same) would be better than continuing to live.

>False. You all think life is good while I think life is bad and death is neutral and therefore better.

 This statement posits the following value:

```
    Living(X|X∈Person) < 0
    Dead(X|X∈Person) = 0
    ∴ Dead(X) > Living(X)
```


Saying that death is better than life is inherently, under the previous definition, suicidal ideation. My statement was not that you *believed* that you were suicidal, merely that assuming good faith (i.e., you were telling the truth about thinking death is better than life), you fall under that definition. You ignore the greater whole of others arguments, and claim that we are making unjustified assumptions based off of things that you have said. You are not arguing in good faith."

Now, to preface this, a good chunk of my jumpers were never human to start with. Hakuryuu, most notably, was and always will have been the Dragon of Chaos and Magic.

Lysandra is... rather set. She's a classical anti-hero in a lot of ways, but her main change has been gathering companions, which helps to make her... more human.

Archon, though, has changed the most. She used to be an idealist, going out of her way to help people.

Then Dark Souls happened, and her best friend/lover got Hollowed. Permanently. So suddenly she's adrift between worlds, with more power than any reasonable person should have and without any fetters. So now she jumps from world to world, ""solving"" the problems mostly with murder and autocracy.

(Once per jump that each of them make, they play poker together with a couple of my other jumpers. It generally ends in blood. Or Lysandra and Archon swearing at each other and Hakuryuu laughing at them.)"
