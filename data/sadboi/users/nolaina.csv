Medvet in Metarie is a good 24 hour emergency and specialty clinic. They can help you apply for financing through Care Credit. I would try to go there tonight or first thing in the morning because it sounds like he is critical.

Alternatively, I know laspca on the westbank does extremely reasonable prices for medical visits for community or feral cats. I've gotten dental work done there on strays for under $100. I do not know if they do payment plans, if the discounts apply to owned pets, if anyone is there on Saturday, or if they are even operating normally right now. If you call and talk to them make sure they know it is an emergency, maybe ask to talk to someone higher up if they only offer an appointment that is days away. They can take emergency cases faster sometimes, but reception isn't always aware of that for some reason.

If a vet suggests assist feeding, giving meds, or doing sub-q fluids please PM me. I'm like nurse level cat lady. I can help you learn and point you towards cheap supplies.

NewOrleans,fkwn05o,t3_fl4nah,1584597781.0,"Sorry you're feeling bad. Here's a copy/paste from a previous thread explaining that I had a really easy time getting tested at Crescent Care on Elysian Fields. You might want to head over there in the morning. 

&#x200B;

>I  called there this morning to see about being tested for mild yet  suspicious symptoms. Was told it was for existing patients. Explained I  had possible exposure. Was given a doctors appointment and told it would  be around $100 cash.  
>  
>Got there and saw a sign on the door directing suspected  Corona cases to the parking garage. They **were** doing **free** walk up testing. Lady on the phone this morning didn't have good info.  
>  
>You stand behind a line, wait to be asked about symptoms. If you have  any relevant ones, you're given a mask and a sticker and directed to a  tent. They take your contact info verbally, do not ask for any  documentation. No questions of residency, status, etc.  
>  
>Then you go in a little blood drive style bus. They take your temp  and a more detailed history. The doc comes in to give you a swab. I got a  flu swab and a covid-19 swab. Flu goes up one nostril, covid goes in  both. You wait a couple of minutes for the flu result. They ask you to  self isolate for up to four days until they call you with the results.   
>  
>Whole process probably took less than 20 minutes and was super duper easy even for someone with anxiety as bad as mine.   
>  
>TL;DR Open. Walk up. Everyone is welcome. No cost. No crowd. No  hassle. Clean process. Great staff. Go if you feel like you should."
