bipolar,etjtj2h,t3_cc1c0z,1562881149.0,"Remember Abilify is an antipsychotic. So, it will weaken the effects of LSD.. so, one tab will definitely not be enough. Like, it did shit for me. I had some interesting thoughts, the Sky was a bit brighter... but barely anything. Like, I felt like it was just a heightened level of myself. As for weed.. weed increases manic symptoms, supposedly. Really, I just feel like my thoughts are a bit out there when I’m manic-high. (Imagine the calmness of being high but your brain thinking really weird shit that may or may not be seen as paranoia.. typically I think about how weird humans are. How ugly of creatures we are. How weird it is that we walk on two feet and have limbs that extend into more working limbs. And we grow hair in random places.. and have long as fuck arms and legs... honestly, I just overthink shit.. a lot of overthinking. Sometimes similar to the thinking that occurs on one tab of LSD while on an antipsychotic. Sometimes I have to look in a mirror to ground myself.. like to remind myself humans aren’t that scary lol)

TL;DR: You will need more LSD than others to achieve the same level of high.. and weed makes you manic-high aka overthink shit. In my experience. Have not experimented with any other drugs since starting abilify, though."

SuicideWatch,esarr23,t3_c6q9v1,1561766914.0,"I have this same problem. I have plenty of thoughts roaming around in my head.. plenty of topics, but when I meet new people that seem cooler than me or are just intimidating, in general, or even talk to people I kinda know, but not good enough to be myself around them... I end up freezing socially. I go straight for the generic, and it is uncomfortably formal and very unlike myself. So, I have had a hell of a time making friends. Outside of my boyfriend and a few token people I will hang out with/see randomly a few times a year.. I have no one. It is very very lonely. Makes you feel as though no one understands you and no one is interested.. just like a lame as shit human. Seriously, it's to the point I don't say anything at all. Especially around my boyfriend's friends. I'm a mute. But, when they do talk to me, which is rarely, very boring. Very unlike me. It mostly stems from my fear of my bipolar II, honestly. Like, I am afraid of my socially induced hypomania. I talk far too much and give an excessive amount of information.. Get *very* annoying, over-complimenting.. all that bullshit. So, I just don't talk at all. That is my happy place really, silence.

But, here is the thing. After every social encounter, I end up drained and hopeless as fuck. Like, I hate myself on such a new level that I wonder why I am even existing. Like, suicidal ideation.. The typical ""I will always be alone"" ""What is wrong with me"" ""Why am I the least cool human on the planet"" ""my gut is eating itself"" ""my wrists ache"" ""There is no point in my existence"" ""I deserve to die""etc.

As for what I have done about it? Well, currently, I am trying to teach myself how to love myself. Because, I always hear you have to like yourself first, before you can be liked by anyone else. Like, confidence is key, right? If you think you're the shit. If you tell yourself ""my ideas are just as interesting as anyone else's ideas"" then talking about them comes easily. Sometimes, it's the generic stuff that leads to real conversation, though. Getting involved in hobbies.. finding groups.. going out.. just putting yourself in situations where you feel you will find like minds.. Anything! You just have to bring up something you're into, and people tend to follow. And if they don't, talk about that! It can go either way, really... Like, once you let your guard down words just *flow*. Talk about your weird as shit thoughts, but try to keep em positive. People like positive, I'm learning. There are moments you can bond over similar issues, but unless the other person shows that something is obviously wrong or they bring it up... it isn't necessary.

I have yet to find my people, but these are things I've done in the past that have helped me make friends. I don't have them anymore, but.. I used to be the queen of the scene. I was SO POPULAR (you know when I was 12 and again in high school.. but that came with fake friends that have given me trust issues, so fuck high school) so I kinda know what I am talking about. Though, I have forgotten most of it. Honestly, once my bipolar began to act up, that is when I started to lose everyone. And the fact that I like girls and am afraid to talk to them. But all that out of the way...

&#x200B;

Just love yourself. Fucking write self affirmations every day. Do anything that makes you feel good, and do it a lot. Find that inner confidence.. Find those interests.. and share it with the world."

I personally don’t feel the “H” applies to me, so I may not be able to help you. But when I’m not hypomanic and I’m just existing, it’s like my brain is on another planet. Like, I’m on a stimulant right now so this is extremely hard to explain currently. But, I find myself just lost in thought. I am not productive—at all. Unless it’s something I am innately interested in, I’m just not present. Reading is a disaster for me. I don’t retain anything unless I am, again, interested in it. I’m overfocused subtype, so my thoughts tend to stay on one thing, but rarely the thing I’m supposed to be focused on. Like, unlike others with ADHD, my thoughts don’t really jump from place to place. So I may not be very helpful to you. Like I’m a one-track-mind kind of person. If something is on my mind, at all. Again, kind of interlacing with the bipolar “obsessive thinking” trait, but it’s different because I don’t know. Can Bipolar people be so lost in thought that they find themselves staring at walls? Like, when I have no external stimuli, I’ve been compared to Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter."
bipolar,erquddm,t1_erq5kkb,1561152290.0,"Honestly, I am lost myself. I mean, I’ve been on stimulants since late high school, and though they can make me hypomanic, I’ve found them to be the only thing that helps me focus. So, that is probably not the most helpful information. But, I also consume a lot of caffeine in an attempt to combat it all. Sometimes, I swear, the pink drink from Starbucks is like the perfect level of sugar and caffeine for me. Like, I feel awake and focused. Sometimes I wonder if combating low blood sugar helps with attention problems.. but that’s my own theory that I haven’t looked into really. Maybe it’s the intake of tea, I don’t know.

My biggest tip is to get plenty of sleep and a healthy diet. I was vegan for a few months a few years ago, and truthfully I have never felt better in terms of my psyche. Like, not one depressive episode and I wasn’t overzealous either. If I remember right, I was very productive during that time. Very much so contemplating going back to the diet because of those reasons, actually. But, giving up meat and dairy and eating primarily vegetables is hard.. so hard. Meat is one thing. I’ve been without meat for almost 2 years, but dairy... plus I’m a lazy chef, and vegetables take preparation. 

But yeah, healthy diet, plentiful sleep.. finding something boring (but interesting enough to take up those background thoughts) to have as background noise while working can help. My go-to is Bloomberg tv.. best $10 a month I spend. Have no idea what they’re saying but that’s the reason I use it. It keeps my background thoughts activated, but it does not consume my foreground thoughts. Aka, it helps me focus. And they don’t get too involved in politics, so it doesn’t get me all amped up either. Which I think is the key, you have to find a very mellow source that doesn’t make you anxious or manic.. plus, I think watching it just makes me feel smarter and more productive, in general.

Let me see.. anything else I do.. I’m on the abilify injection, so as long as I make my monthly appointment, I have no problems with remembering to take my meds. I just have to remember my Straterra and Vyvanse. Which again, does nothing to help you! Hm..

Classical music can get you going and keep your thoughts occupied, yet vacant enough for the content you have at hand. Honestly, anything that makes you feel smarter helps. Gotta love those placebos. Like, I’m serious, if you can convince yourself something works, it works. Like, I’m a firm believer in the law of attraction. If you allow your brain to be consumed with thoughts that you can’t focus or that you’re too manic to function, then that’s typically how things go. I’m personally thinking of doing something semi-douchey like meditation or yoga to find that inner zen. I mean, meds only do so much.. but yeah, classical music is a good one. Some times I try to force myself into a mania (like attempt to hit the hyper-focused, get shit done kind of mania) by listening to “pump up” music but that rarely RARELY works. I just get so manic that I’m having an even harder time focusing. 

Sorry that’s so much. I just really want to help you, myself even, so I tried to think of every possible thing I do that has worked for me."

Most days I don’t feel like anyone understands and that most people look down on people like myself. Thank you for being the exception."

But honestly, worst thing. Trying to concentrate is a shit show."
