He became cold and distant and shut himself off from me. After he ended our partnership, and we continued to live together for over a year, during arguments he would try to blame **me**. Telling me that I should have known, that he had told me when we first met as teenagers how he felt he was a girl. He told me he was gay, not trans. And then he was trans, not gay. And then he was trans *and* gay. And then back to just gay. And then back to trans. And then no, he really was gay... (flip-flopping like this for over a year). He used me for years, and told me it was so that he appeared normal to everyone else. He used me so that he didn't have to face who he truly was, and didn't have to tell his family he was gay (or trans or whatever it is he actually ended up on...). One of my last memories of living with him was him flirting with a female coworker in his bedroom across from my bedroom door while I was home. I wish he'd grown a pair. I wish I hadn't fallen in love with someone so ruled by cowardice.

The pharaoh at the time, Akhenaten, basically decided to uproot the entire society and physically move out to a desolate barren area and make an entire new capital city. The culture was polytheistic at the time, and he wanted to enforce a more monotheistic approach - worshiping Aten, the sun, above the other gods.

Akhenaten was largely viewed as a heretic and the site was abandoned shortly after he died (1332 BCE). The legacy of his reign and his family is steeped in a ton of mystery and intrigue. The wall carvings and art portraying this time period are unlike any other, showing him and his wife with children sitting on their laps. Normal everyday life for royalty was never depicted on temple walls like that before. From Wikipedia; ""*Sculptures of Akhenaten deviate from conventional portrayal of royalty. Akhenaten is depicted in an androgynous and highly stylized manner, with large thighs, a slim torso, drooping belly, full lips, and a long neck and nose*.""

You're allowed to stand up for yourself, though. You can also ignore them. You can also fight fire with fire, throw the same shit back. Most of all, though, you can always opt out. I've not played Valorant but most games have the ability to mute people, leave chat in general, leave the match, block certain players, etc. 

I'd also keep in mind that many of the biggest talkers also talk shit to their male friends. There is indeed a difference between banter and bullying, but that happens to both genders. I've had my fair share of guys standing up for me *because* I'm female, but I've never heard a guy defend another guy from getting shit on.

You're allowed to throw it back. Or ignore 'em. Or leave. Or just have fun playing the game and give them no attention (which I think is what you did). If their comments were against the game's rules, or community guidelines, then you can report them.

Well. The behavior usually *can* be excused as just banter. Often poorly thought out and redundant jokes, some people are just like that.

No, I'm making the assertion that IF a lady is wearing religious garb meant to divert the gaze of men, THEN accentuating feminine features with makeup negates that initial effort.

My base assumptions are that women can do whatever they want with their hair, face, and body, for whatever reason they deem fit.

I'm hoping this is just an off-handed statement - because I don't see anywhere that I attacked someone or acted with cruelty. I don't plan on attacking people for their personal choices, either. (Also by the way, I think *everyone* is just a normal person trying to adjust to life. We're all just humans)."

There are multiple verses about covering the face. ""**It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ihraam. When they came near us we would lower our jilbaabs from our heads over our faces, and when they had passed by we would uncover our faces. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1562.""**

It's my personal belief that women should be able to wear or not-wear whatever they choose to.

I don't fully agree. It happens to be how our society works at this point in time, but it didn't always, and may not always. There are many tribes, for example, that have no problem with complete nudity. It's natural. It has as much to do with societal norms as it does with regulation and law that we can't walk down the sidewalk without any knickers on. Nudity is not inherently shameful, it is taught - it comes from the culture we are brought up in.

What a colorful sentence, I dig it lol.

>it is formed both from i) what we don't want to see in others, as well as ii) what we don't want to display to others 

Everyone should have the freedom to display or not-display what they choose while in public, the only person that is in control of your body should be you. But as for what you *see*, that is not up to you. I will agree that it's a nuanced subject with much room for discussion. But my first thoughts would have to do with our right to protect children from free-swinging genitalia, ideas like that.

> So, I don't see a problem with a woman doing whatever makes her happy, and then covering up whatever the community has deemed necessary 

I agree with this first point, which is why my first paragraph included ""*I believe every human has the right to do whatever they wish with their own body - so the issue I take here is one of cognitive dissonance*."" As for the 'whatever the community has deemed necessary' I whole-heartedly disagree. If Iran has come to the conclusion that half of their population must wear black head-to-toe Burqa in public, that does not mean it's morally acceptable to enforce such a rule.

Wow, what a closer. Okay so I did not say anything about discouraging women from wearing makeup. Refer back to my point about cognitive-dissonance. If me pointing out a contradiction and opening up a sincere back and forth conversation is a 'horrible thing' then I wonder why you are spending time on a subreddit specifically for debate. Since you assumed, and didn't ask - I'm a female Canadian who loves flamboyant makeup, dyed hair, and piercings. I don't think any woman, anywhere in the world should feel obligated to cover themselves for anyone else for any reason. I don't think any woman should have to fear being disowned by their family for not wishing to cover their hair. I don't think any woman in the middle east should be buried to the waist in sand and have their heads caved in with rocks for adultery - rules from the same book that tell them to cover their 'shameful' body.

DebateReligion,fodmemv,t1_foddknf,1587686487.0,"Hello Dogwoodhikes :)

There's a lot of points in that comment. I think there's a big difference between the type of control seen in employment, versus the control seen coming down from government. Not only is there a big difference from topic to topic there, but there's a huge difference from place to place around the world.

I think places like USA, Canada, UK etc., have some of the most open and readily available freedoms that we've ever seen in written history. The amount of 'control' is very little compared to how bad things have been in the past. I think big biz and government and politics are on their way to improving. It's definitely not perfect, but I can say for a fact that it is *better*. That is what we need to keep focusing on, just improving, making things better. Culturally accepted rules and norms will be a thing today, tomorrow, and 500 years from now - we are individual humans but we also act as a collective unit. Freedom and bodily autonomy are important, which is what we've been striving for and achieving over the past 100 years or so. 

I think the further we progress, the more we learn, and the more we respect the rights of the individual - there will be less control and dictation from on high. I unfortunately also think it's possible for us to go through a regression and lose freedoms... who knows. The world seems to be teetering on the edge of absolute chaos as of late. I'm not educated enough on the affairs of the global stage to make any sort of guess as to where we're headed. Hopefully we can keep improving quality of life and freedom like we have been doing. I do think big-biz and big-gov pose a great threat to us all if left unchecked. If freedom of speech gets quashed, like we've seen happening in bursts in areas like Youtube and News Media, then that is where the voice of the individual falls apart, and dictatorships can sneak in."
