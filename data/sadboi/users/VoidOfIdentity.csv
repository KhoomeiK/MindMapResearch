it is NOT true that just because BPD is treatable does not mean you're not suffering. i was doing this for a long time too, i would tell my therapist that i was extremely suicidal (when i wasnt) so i felt like i got the attention i needed - because i was in so much pain and i felt like no one took me seriously. i take you seriously.

exmuslim,fn4mz92,t3_fz8o0b,1586644713.0,"I wore the hijab as a child, from ages 4(maybe 5) - 13ish. When I got to highschool I just couldn't do it anymore.
To me, it was humiliating, even as a child who somewhat believed in islam. I grew up in a western country and I always had other children staring at me. I wasn't allowed to play or talk with children that were not Muslim, so I assumed they hated me or something. 
It was also so repressing. I am SO ANGRY I wasn't allowed to feel anything as a child. No grass on my legs, no wind in my hair, no sun on my body, no sand on my feet... 
I had to wear full long sleeves and long pants from the age of 4 or 5 as well. Making children wear the hijab is devastating. I absolutely consider it child abuse."
