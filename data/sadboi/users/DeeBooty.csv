depression,feq78h2,t3_eqe632,1579338508.0,"When you find the right treatment, these feelings resolve and things get better.  I don’t know how many medication trials you’ve had, but keep trying. You may need multiple meds or other therapies. If you haven’t tried TMS, I recommend it. It is magnetic stimulation of the brain over a few weeks. Very little works for me; but that did.  Most insurance covers it too. I hope you find the thing for you and get relief."
depression,feq2du5,t3_eqcm2n,1579336554.0,I have alway found some source of hope since onset in 1997.  I was told once suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. That no longer applies with my diagnosis of F.M.F.
depression,feq1aw1,t3_eqcm2n,1579335991.0,"That is a great suggestion, but it is brand name only and costs more than my mortgage without being covered. I have tried everything and this is the only thing that controls near constant SI, It is an injectable, and I get it every 21 days. I am literally on 10 daily medications for my mental health and chronic illness.

I just checked. Good Rx can save me $600, bringing it to $2562.64. There is no generic."

persiancat,f0ad0rl,t3_bk7hzx,1568513298.0,"I do my first wash with dawn dish soap( avoiding head)It is a  great degreaser. I wash again with soothing cat shampoo. I wash the face with baby shampoo and a wash cloth. After rinsing, pour a vinegar water solution( 1 part to 3 parrts)  over body, avoiding face. Give a good final rinse. towel dry and then blow dry. Make sure to bush and comb as you dry them.  

In between baths, you can use corn starch, as a safe dry shampoo. Just comb out the coat, apply corn starch and brush through. 

I honestly think you should bathe then quarterly for the best results."

AskDocs,f035lkw,t1_f01zmn2,1568345419.0,It can be hard to understand how hypersexuality can cause this cheating...but it can.
AskDocs,f0341h3,t3_d3b7gc,1568344217.0,"If he is suddenly a jerk a few weeks into lexipro treatment....he is probably mentally ill and not really a jerk.

Sounds to me like irritable mania from the account, a lesser known and just as serious as if he had elated or “happy” mania. It indicates that he has mood disorder. 

That lexipro is a powerful, SSRI. If given to a bi-polar person with out a mood stabilizer, it is a kmown trigger of such a manic episode.  

So try to remember he is very sick right now; but it is not forever.  He will, like most, get much better with proper diagnosis and treatment. 

I assure you: the irritability, the sudden drinking, risk taking behaviors, making unusual choices you would not expect, disruption of sleep, and even that weird sexting you after you have gone to bed (hypersexuslity), are all symptoms of mania."
