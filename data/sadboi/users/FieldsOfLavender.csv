Wow.  Another ""you can lift yourself up by the bootstraps"" person.  Try asking mentally ill people whether they are choosing their illness or not.  I would not wish depression or any of my other mental illnesses on my worst enemy!

> How the fuck can depression be seen as a disability? Does it limit your mobility? Can you not get up stairs without having someone wheel you to the elevator or wheel yourself?

Oh, you mean I still have mobility even though my depression can keep me bed-bound for days at a time?

Uh, depression is a problem in the brain, meaning it's by definition ""neurological"", despite the fact that you seem to think folks with disabilities other than mental illness are somehow better than those of us with disabling mental illness.

> These people are stealing benefits that people who actually have life long neurological or physical issues are applying for and it’s inexcusable.

Again, no disability is ""better"" than another-- that's ableist.  Mental illness can be literally disabling to some people.  Do you think the government just hands out SSI or SSDI disability payments on a whim?  Do you think the application process is easy, or that they don't demand tons and tons of proof, and medical records to verify our symptoms?  I promise you, if the federal government has assessed a person with mental illness and concluded that the person's mental illness is so bad as to be disabling, then the person has just as ""real"" of a disability as someone with a physical disability like CP or blindness."
