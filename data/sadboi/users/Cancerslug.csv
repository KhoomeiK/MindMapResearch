I bought it when it was released, and on my old i7 and 970 I am still playing the game just as I was...

I've noticed no slowdown or fps drops, the game launches fine, and I have no problems running anticheat because I don't cheat. I understand peoples concerns, but I've had little of my own issues with anticheat programs. Punkbuster not updating back in the 2000s probably being the worst..."
Games,fqo7wyu,t1_fqo5d1t,1589509405.0,"Been a fan since the first came out, and I agree. Eternal turned the new features in Doom 2016 to 11. It felt like Doom mixed a lot of new gameplay mechanics into what worked best in Doom 3; the visuals and designs, and achieved what I think D3 tried. I love Eternal to death however, it's going to be the first game I finish 100% on in one play through, which I am still on, because I just do not want the ride to end!"
