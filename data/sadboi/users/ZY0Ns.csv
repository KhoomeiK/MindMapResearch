This is a huge reality check, there is no way you finish a prayer acknowledging that pmo or whatever is ruining your life in front of the creator then going straight to watching pmo. I don't believe that much in the religion but I believe that Satan is our lizard brain, it just seeks pleasure, doesent think about the future, it's our instincts. God is our rational part of the brain,  he knows that doing pmo or overeating is bad. If you pray frequently and talk with God, you are using your rational part of the brain, its similar to writing a diary. If you don't talk with anyone about your goals, your problems,  then you will be lost to your instincts just wanting short term pleasure and your life will slowly become hell.

If a kid saw a girl getting beaten and used as a mop to sweep the floor since a young age, and he keeps seeing it, that will become normal for him.

Purtroppo sono stato a contatto con la pornografia da giovanissimo, ancora non capivo cosa fosse ma mi faceva sentire in un modo strano. Fast forward a 18 anni dovevo segarmi una volta al giorno,  il mio mondo fantastico che avevo  nella testa da bambino, che mi bastavano due giocattoli per immaginarmi battaglie epiche, svanito,  solo buio e depressione, l'unica cosa che mi faceva sentire bene era il porno, e ne volevo sempre di più, sempre più raro e mai visto, sempre più spinto e strano che dopo aver finito mi sentivo disgustato. È come se venissi posseduto, e dentro di me è come se ci fossero due persone, una pura che voleva solo felicità, esprimermi artisticamente, fare cose produttive. L'altra invece voleva solo il piacere. ""Che cazzo me ne frega se quella ragazza sta soffrendo? Ancora meglio, godo mentre soffri, troia."" Un esempio dei pensieri che mi si creavano, la cosa è che subito dopo esser venuto, mi svegliavo e provavo un disgusto enorme. Adesso la pornografia è solo un brutto evento della mia vita, non sono più depresso e mi sento orgoglioso di aver sconfitto questo drago.Sembra di uscire dal Matrix.

Alla fine guardando porno hardcore , vedendo migliaia di ragazze violate e sodomizzate si creano una realtà distorta nel quale le ragazze sono tutte carne da usare, e l'idea li eccita. Credo che la pornografia sia la piaga sociale del ventunesimo secolo,  ti fotte il cervello, deforma la realtà e ti deprime.

Also there is a tech company that wants to hire me full time but it's too far from home, I can't afford to travel 70km twice every day, and I can't afford a driving license either,  If I did I could go there but it would cost me 400€ per month.
This one year course has been a blessing because they are teaching practical skills to start working in the industrial and home automation industry, and it is guaranteed I will get a job at the end of this year, I am just grateful of the experience because I really treated money like it grew on trees before this small crysis, now I am interested in saving and personal finance, this is why I came to this sub"

And of course I tried finding another one but there is nothing for now. Hopefully next month there should be some but I have lived without a job and no money flowing in for the last 3/4 months."
personalfinance,fgmq71r,t1_fgmpffq,1580929816.0,"I already searched for a job myself but I found nothing in my area, and I am just 19 with no career,  my father has been searching for two months and he has more work experience than my age lol"

I added the Saving flair to this post, the point is the importance of saving. Start saving instead of spending all your money and living paycheck to paycheck, because it can happen that you won't get payed and going to find a new job is easier said than done."

But it's all about finding the right amount of water. If you pee before sleeping then drink 2 glasses of water, that should be enough to wake up and too little to piss yourself"

And another useful tip, before sleeping drink a good amount of water so you will naturally wake up to take a piss"

I was convinced of that, I had a very kind gf and I would tell her everything,  I opened myself for the first time and it was great, but soon she inevitably got bored of me and the relationship collapsed, the more I tried to fix it the worse it got."

But if you don't have anything like that, sure, Wet wipes are a compromise. (Cleaning with soap and water is the most hygenic way tho)"
