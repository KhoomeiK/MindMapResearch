backrooms,fmky6g6,t3_fvn8uo,1586173025.0,"Alright i'm bored so ill answer all your questions, 1. You have to run directly into it in video games when you no clip you go directly through objects. 2. Yes you will get hungry and you will get tired and need to sleep so bring some snacks with ya. I've seen pictures of backrooms with outlets not sure if they work though i'm assuming they do why not? 3. Those are higher levels of backrooms you reach them by no clipping out of level 0 which is what we see most of the time in the backrooms. The higher levels contain scary monsters that look like scp-096. There is no time in the backrooms. You could be there for 1000 years and time would'nt pass in our world. 4. i'm pretty sure your still ageing though so no way to prove that. 5. Yes the backrooms all have a spawn point at level 0. every ones exact spawn point is different but you can meet other no clippers and people who found their way there in dreams. 6. My guess is that the backrooms are infinite. The rooms just change form over time to meet our criteria of reality. If one was to no clip before the backrooms existed where would they go? i'm assuming they always existed they just looked different back then. 7. As far as i know there is no known way to create your own entry points. however i don't see why you couldn't use someone else's entry point. 8. Not to my knowledge but its certainly possible."

depression,fj8p4y5,t3_fc0f4c,1583118679.0,from my perspective you have every right to be depressed. your in a really tough spot now anyone in your shoes would feel the exact same way im sure. Please dont listen to the people that say all of those awful things about you. when people say things like that you start to believe it subconciously but i can assure you those things are about as far away from the truth as you can get. you are very strong and admirable to me. I've lost something very important to me you feel all this pain and guilt but you still have enough strength to post this. I have yet to find a solution to my sadness but nowadays i just reminisce on the good old days and try to forget how bad  things are right now. Probably not the most productive coping mechanism but i find thats what works best for me these days.

OnePiece,fghnwyh,t1_fghnggp,1580789208.0,Kizaru relies way too much on his devil fruit. And katakuris endurance is god tier. Katakuri adapted to snake mans speed and could dodge and counter consistently. Whats important to keep in mind is that there's a BIG difference between speed of light in real life and how its portrayed in one piece.

OnePiece,fgf97ja,t3_ey5zib,1580730843.0,Its simple really hes the newest yonko. The blackbeard pirates are well known ability hunters but this is just prep for their fights. The world government is worried about them. But he hasn't done anything too drastic with that power yet. His bounty will probably increase after he fights shanks or one of the other yonko. I feel like the yonko are less ranked based on their potential power and more what they actually have done with that power. Its based on how big of a threat is this pirate to the world government. And teach lets keep it real here is currently the least dangerous from the world governments perspective. for now that is
space,fg76kio,t3_examwf,1580585187.0,it scares me too. but not enough to make me panic. more of a thrill kind of fear. The scale of things can be a comfort because it means your small. and if your small your problems and fears are small too.
