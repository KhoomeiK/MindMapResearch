From what I remember of the original video, there was an off screen argument between the black dude and the white lady, the white lady was accused of saying some racist stuff which is probably true because of her comments at the end of the video like her grandpa owning his ancestors. Anyways while they were arguing, her boyfriend was in the bathroom- once he got out an altercation started, though I don’t think it was captured who attacked first.

TL;DR: White lady and black dude arguing while her boyfriend was in the bathroom, once he came out he got vibe checked for his racist gf."
