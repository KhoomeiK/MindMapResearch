mentalhealth,f4efpei,t3_dkgcw0,1571557206.0,That’s amazing I understand self harming and how hard it is to stop. Even not self harming for a week is an accomplishment. Not self harming for 2 months means ur rly starting to take care of urself and I am so proud of u!! I don’t even know you i I’m so proud of u and u have come a long way and u deserve the best!
mentalhealth,f3eneqq,t3_dgpbln,1570882693.0,"Someone must love you. Ur family, friends, work mates etc. I have never had to transition and I can’t relate with you on that but I feel like I have hobbies, work and socialise and I still feel terrible, unloved and like I’m not worthy of loving. I’m not sure what it is. But just know that someone out there goes through the same thing as you everyday. U r not alone."
