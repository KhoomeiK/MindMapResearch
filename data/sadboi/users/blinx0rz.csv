depression,fqvrmta,t1_fqvh3eu,1589683633.0,"That won't work forever be it you find a nice lady or something else. Putting off to the last minute may seem like a hack If it works.  You would have to live a very isolating life with not many hobbies. And the stress ways on you. Leading some people to drug addictions  

I myself know I can get whatever I need done right at the deadline. Thinking I'm a genius and have so much free time. In essence you find yourself not enjoying the things your putting off because they make you feel stressed and annoyed.  Something like I love the gym and have fun at it .  But I'll put it off and  cramp 3 days of workouts in one. Long stupid reply by me .

Moderation is key. (Lame post warning)"

dating_advice,fqorsg7,t3_gjr3xd,1589522962.0,"I'm a Male,  me and my ex were together for 3 years. I'm a struggling drug addict . She loved me so much from the start and I was kinda selfish..I knew she loved me more than I loved her. And I took advantage of that. Aver the years I kept messing up and she starting seeing that I didn't care . Then I relapsed big time and went in and out of rehabs for 9 months 
6 months in she starting saying this like ""we aren't together anymore "" ""I TELL people I don't have a bf anymore "" and she had all  the right. But the month I went to get help her current ""bf trans"" started  working with her . And I was gone not living in our apartment with her. And she was so sad and mad at me , it destroyed her. But she always said we would figure this out. So I guess her and the new guy at her work probably starting hitting it off, because she started telling me she hanging out with  her gay boyfriend and lying about her drinking. Eventually i found out my ex fell in love with this gay workmate and have been seeing each other from the get go. 

When she was still telling me she still loved me and wanted us to work out. I noticed something was off. Her facebook status changed as long as her profile picture
 She told me she cant let her parents know we are still dating.  I soon realized later that she was her putting herself  out there in the dating world and especially  to her new coworkers. Because she moved on months ago, before me even knowing. I was still thinking she loved me.  Well she did. But didn't see us growing anymore as much as she loved me she needed to take care of herself and her needs. She tried her best with me....

Do I think she should of told me right away she was starting to look around ? Yes and no. I was very fragile and newly sober and she thought it would hurt me to much..she left me with hope 
 But she knew I wasn't going stay sober for her. To many past experience shown her that. I only cared for myself.
I found out and called her all the names in the book she said she ""tried"" and ""waited "" but the truth is she starting growing apart months before our initial break up.(me going on her Facebook and reading her message telling this dude she loves him"" all along while she was still feeding me hope while I was trying to get help. I understand her reasons 
 She really did love me and though we would get married. But I took to long and she moved on to something else. 

I have tried to contact her since.  At first she said she was just with this person for rent and a place to stay
 . But I knew she just didn't want to hurt me and give me hope so I would get sober. Even though she knew we were over
I kept contacting her and being annoying 
..she eventually blocked me. But since then unblocked. She moved Vegas with her new female to male boyfriend. Of course I still think it's a stage she's going through..and once I get better and mature she will come back.   Hahha that will never be the case ..but ya we lived together for 3 years 

Sorry I made no sense"
dating_advice,fqoos9d,t1_fqnr5jm,1589520547.0,"Ya ima guy. And I never realized the torture I was putting her through until it was too late,  and I found out she was in love with a female to make transexual and moved to Vegas...but I was a really bad bf. She cared for me  but couldn't stand seeing me ruin myself.  Still hurts she could of said something.. I still regret not trying harder till this day"
