Although raising children is expensive here, the basics like food, water and clothes are cheap to come by, and it's very easy to get second hand prams, toys and stuff like that. If you want to raise your child well then yeah you have payout for that but if you're content giving your child a similar quality of life than you yourself had growing up then it's not expensive at all.

I understand where you're coming from, I did reach out because it sits with me uncomfortably. The vocal support this thread has recieved did surprise me somewhat and I was expecting more negativitity. I'm not sure if that's just my moral conscience, internalised homophobia or whatever else.

Most people that have shared similar experiences on this thread have had age gaps similar to ours but started off on a more level playing field. 20+ onwards and on reflection the person i was at 18 and the person I was at 20 are very different people.
