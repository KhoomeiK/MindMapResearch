Waiting for it to proc is a bit scary on some weeks and isn‚Äôt reliable for most pug groups, so I rarely use this these days. You should try both and see how that works with your play style , then adjust accordingly. 

Also like another commenter said - for pugs I usually run more healing throughout rather than dps. Crucible is my main Essence since it can do both. There is also a need to synergize your Essence choice with your Azerite gear traits and talents. It makes a huge difference if you get complementary ones across the 3."

You might just have to wait for the dungeon queues, it is tough indeed but hang in there bud! 

If you have extra money lying around, I‚Äôd rather suggest you to buy a token and sell it on the auction house for gold. You‚Äôll need lots of gold for end game stuff, to buy potions and flasks and repairs. 
Paying for boosts - have you seen the price for those??! Not sure if you want to take that route but... if you continue playing, you‚Äôll eventually get to a decent gear and skill level anyway.

I just wanted to say you‚Äôre not alone at that level/gear. Eventually I liked using a dh for casual pvp! Waiting for the good dh peeps to come by and reply :-)

P.s edited to add: don‚Äôt delete your character it changes nothing. You‚Äôd need to get used to moving around/stunning and interrupting the mobs you‚Äôre fighting to take less damage. Also your defensives like Blur or Darkness. They all have cooldown timers so you‚Äôd have to keep playing and practicing to get a better sense of when to use what in order to survive.

You can‚Äôt just stand there and eat damage you won‚Äôt survive at this stage. Maybe try using the tank specialisation for now, you‚Äôll find it easier to finish your quests and go around doing world pve stuff."

CompetitiveWoW,fqif83b,t1_fqib42o,1589395205.0,"Group dynamics tho. Decent healers are always casting. So that means they are either doing damage - or healing. There is a trade off. 

If the group doesn‚Äôt use their defensives/potions and instead relies on the healer to top them up all the time, then yeah there won‚Äôt be time for the healer to dps as much. 

The good teams pushing 22+ are coordinated and have very experienced players, and watching them I noticed that the dps takes minimal damage, the tank heals/mitigates a lot of dmg, and the healer spends a lot of time to dps. The pulls are calculated too, and very few (or no) mistakes made by anyone. It‚Äôs really satisfying to watch them run dungeons!"

hamsters,foylmzv,t1_foyiflg,1588174729.0,"I know where you‚Äôre coming from. Do note that you can choose to try and make a compromise with their living conditions or do nothing at all. In the case of the latter, when they grow older, they will very very likely start fighting each other. The reason is simple - they are mature and their instincts for survival get strong. They want their own space etc, so if their home is small, they will injure each other at some point while trying to do what their instincts tell them to do. 

I personally think that an injured hamster is more expensive to treat then a plastic storage box. Also, please don‚Äôt spend $100 on a 40gallon tank. I have all my hamsters with me in my room right beside my bed too. I wish I could give them more space, but like you, I have to balance out some other concerns. Compromise is key.

I found some plastic storage container online from taobao, and it is about SG$20 (55cmx40cm x35cm height), so each robo gets one. My Syrian has a 80x50cm bin home which is SG$25 from ikea. 

It doesn‚Äôt have to be huge, just find something in between what is recommended and suitable for the space you have. Prepare two of these plastic boxes - you will need it. Once they start fighting, things go bad very fast. 

I‚Äôm like you, I insisted on housing two robo sisters together too. And they were okay until the time they became sexually mature, and then they were not so ok with each other. The timid one actually bit part of the extroverted girl‚Äôs ear off :-( 

My heart shattered, and I went out immediately to buy both of them a bigger home, as well as separate them. Like you, I wanted to believe that they will like each other‚Äôs company, so I put them together again after a week. To my relief, they were okay for three nights, then back to squabbling all night again. I was wrong. 
They have been permanently separated and are doing perfectly fine. 

Research has shown that hamsters are perfectly fine living alone as they do that in the wild too. They may have some shared storage etc but that‚Äôs in the context of kilometres of open space in their natural habitat. And they sometimes share - only because some other hamster or rodent has already dug a tunnel. Yes, they like digging, it is wired into them and makes them feel safe if they can hide. 

FYI don‚Äôt worry about having 6‚Äù of bedding for them to burrow. Just do an in between, compromise is more important than doing nothing. PM if you need help with buying basic supplies? I‚Äôm in Asia too."

AskMen,fnn5qbp,t1_fnmikvt,1587084990.0,"I‚Äôm with a man who is just as you have described yourself.
There were many times when I first dated him that I questioned if he was straight or not. But the more I got to know him, the less I questioned it. Appearances only tell you a part of the whole story. Some people are not open books, some are. It is all okay. 

He sometimes eats or drinks in a way more familiar to me as being female than male. He is ok with leaning his head on my shoulder on the train to sleep. He is ok with preening himself in public (not excessively). He goes cooing at our hamsters with me. And he is interested in my beauty routine but too lazy to do the full 10 steps or so that I do. He uses pimple patches & occasionally a CC cream (kinda like foundation), which we bought together at Sephora. 

It turns out that he was just really comfortable in his skin around me. He didn‚Äôt felt judged by me so he let his guard down a lot, and was being a kiddy, softer version of masculine. He was totally himself around his guy friends too, so imagine my confusion when someone pointed out that he was totally an alpha male. I didn‚Äôt get to see that side of him yet, lol! 

After knowing him for 2 years. Yeah, he is the most masculine man I‚Äôve ever dated - in an emotional and intimate sense, since his physical build is skinny and I am a few inches taller than him. Heck, I‚Äôve always been considered skinny for my height, but this guy is what, 10kg lighter than I am and that makes me feel fat üòÇ

And yet this current man has brought out a feminine side of me that I have not even known I possessed. 


You know why I would say all these to you? Because I‚Äôve dated guys and also married one with his head up in the skies about toxic masculinity. After the divorce, I can‚Äôt shake off the feeling that that guy is in the closet and that one day he would get together with a man. I felt like a woman with such people, sure, but a crazy one. It‚Äôs stupid and really, there‚Äôs nothing to aspire to other than being your best self for your loved ones.

hamsters,fkguwow,t1_fkfzkd3,1584175504.0,"When I got my boy Syrian hamster, the person had to repeatedly check with me that I wanted a male. Apparently a woman returned a boy Syrian recently, because she was shook and offended by the size of his balls when she found out at home! She took a female hamster in the end üòÇ"

SleepApnea,fkgebl7,t1_fke8m87,1584157195.0,"Oh yeah it has gaps, damn. Maybe wrap aluminium foil around the cable to get him to stop! Or place decoy tubes around, garden hoses perhaps haha!"
SleepApnea,fkdsr7y,t3_fhw9e2,1584093472.0,"You know those curly plastic cable protectors they sell at ikea, they might help, or maybe your‚Äôd have to cover the entire machine üòÖ"

hamsters,fk6unto,t1_fk6id3i,1583916939.0,Ah ok thanks!
hamsters,fk6i8az,t1_fk692k5,1583902917.0,"Excuse me, when you say take him out, do you mean on a leash or you let him run on the grass freely? I live in a city too and am wondering how to safely bring my new Syrian outdoors"
hamsters,fjznbuy,t1_fjzkpz8,1583723919.0,"Cool, he seemed pretty chill even when I saw and interacted with him. Much slower moving than my robos too! Will give him time to settle in! 
The main reason why I chose him, I first saw him as a sleeping pastel coloured tennis ball. Then when he woke he just got curious and let me carry him! My heart xx"
hamsters,fjzkf1b,t1_fjzikq2,1583721819.0,"Yup! He is also going to grow much bigger as the breeder says he‚Äôs still got 5 months to grow! They specialise in the giant versions (i guess in comparison  to smaller Syrians). I won‚Äôt be using tunnels, seems scary. Big wheel prepared üëå

By the way, I‚Äôve seen many photos of people chilling with their Syrians, watching tv and stuff. How can I go about doing this? I‚Äôm worried about him peeing on me or my parents‚Äô furniture üòÇ"
hamsters,fjxmed8,t3_ffd5m6,1583677867.0,"Hi everyone! Hambro (hamster bro) is my first Syrian hamster and I fell in love with him when I got to hold him! I‚Äôm still preparing his bin home so he‚Äôs not with me yet. 

I have two little roborovskis at the moment :-) but we don‚Äôt handle them as they prefer to be watched, not touched! 
Feel free to drop any tips for this first time Syrian owner !"

hamsters,fjf19f8,t3_fcx4bq,1583282156.0,"I am so proud of your kiddo too!  Great name too :-D 

One day while watching my roborovskis run their wheels, I had this thought that they are actually desert chicken nuggets with legs. Hamsters are great and adorably soft pets, enjoy your time with him!"
hamsters,fjcou9e,t3_fcndpm,1583230023.0,"Hello~ I‚Äôd prefer for a more gentler way for the hamster to get around, esp with age, since they have short lives :-( 

Thank you for caring for your hamster!"
hamsters,fjco42i,t3_fces6x,1583228982.0,Omg they monch like they have not seen food for days lol
hamsters,fit8stx,t3_f9kw6o,1582709835.0,Awww so cute! My robos have learned to toss bigger pieces of food on the floor with some sass if they can‚Äôt immediately pouch it. Sunflower seeds they always seem to have space for though! So I would break them up into smaller pieces and leave them on top of things for them to find!
BlenderDoughnuts,fit71vx,t3_f9bib3,1582707440.0,Love the shade of blue! And great composition overall
