> In 1979, The CIA began to destabilize Grenada after Maurice Bishop became president, for his marxist, pro-cuba, anti-racism, and anti-apartheid stances. The previous leader, Eric Gairy, was a British/US puppet who furthered imperialist interests in the region, sacked the treasury, presided over 47% unenemployment, and a 200% cost of living increase. His right wing gang / secret police, the Mongoose gang, ruthlessly tortured Leftists, sending his police to Pinochet's Argentina to learn torture techniques, and even murdered Maurice's father. Under Bishop's leadership, Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. Organisations for education (Center for Popular Education), health care, and youth affairs (National Youth Organization) were also established, as well as free education and health care. A literacy campaign lowered it to less than 5% in 3 years. The campaign against him resulted in his overthrow and the invasion by the U.S. of Grenada on October 25, 1983, with about 277 people dying.

> In 1976, The CIA backed an overthrow of Argentinan leader Isabel Martínez de Perón by right wing anti-communist dictator Jorge Rafael Videla. In 1983, two years after the return of a representative democratic government, he was prosecuted in the Trial of the Juntas for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that took place under his rule, including kidnappings or forced disappearance, widespread torture and extrajudicial murder of activists, and political opponents as well as their families at secret concentration camps, and harboring nazis. An estimated 13,000 -30,000 political dissidents vanished during this period. Videla was also convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at the illegal detention centres and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime. In his defence, Videla maintains the female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to fall pregnant in the belief they wouldn't be tortured or executed. 1

> On 11 September 1973, The CIA backed a military coup to remove democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende, in favor of right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet. His US-supported regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent that was unprecedented in the history of Chile, backed by the neoliberal free-market economic policies of the Chicago Boys. Over-all, the regime left over 3,000 dead or ""dissappeared"", tortured thousands of prisoners, and forced 200,000 Chileans into exile. He's known for the Villa Grimaldi, a torture complex, and his Caravan of Death, a Chilean Army death squad guilty of countless atrocities, including dropping pregnant women and teenagers out of helicopters in the ocean, and executions where prisoners were shot by parts, over extended periods of time. Pinochet's forces are conservatively estimated to have killed over 11,000 people in his first year in power.

> Starting in the 1970s, a CIA-backed coalition of right wing governments in Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil, began Operation Condor, a campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, with the stated aim of ""eliminating Marxist subversion."" Victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals and suspected guerillas. An estimated 30,000 to 80,000 leftists or sympathizers were killed.

> In 1969, amid a collapsing economy, labor and student strikes in Uruguay, CIA operative Dan Mitrione initiates a campaign of torture and violence against the left-wing student group Tuparamos. Former Uruguayan police officials and CIA operatives stated Mitrione had taught torture techniques to Uruguayan police, including the use of electrical shocks delivered to his victims' mouths and genitals. It has been alleged that he used homeless people for training purposes, who were executed once they had served their purpose.

> In 1964, A CIA-backed military coup in Brazil overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. The junta that replaces it will, in the next two decades, become one of the most bloodthirsty in history. General Castelo Branco creates Latin America’s first death squads, or bands of secret police who hunt down communists and political opponents for torture, interrogation and murder. Later it is revealed that the CIA trained the death squads. Thousands were tortured, and hundreds were killed.

> In 1958, The United States supported the Batista dictatorship in Cuba. Batista aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Eventually most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land. As such, Batista's increasingly corrupt and repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships with both the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts. To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace—which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations—Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions; ultimately killing anywhere from hundreds to 20,000 people. After the Cuban revolution, the CIA launched a long campaign of terrorism against Cuba, training Cuban exiles in Florida, Central America and the Dominican Republic to commit assassinations and sabotage in Cuba. These include the cuban embargo, and over 638 failed assasination attempts on fidel castro.

> In 1954, the CIA overthrows the democratically elected Guatemalen Jacobo Árbenz in a military coup in operation PBSucess. Arbenz threatened to nationalize the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit Company, in which CIA Director Allen Dulles also owns stock. Arbenz is replaced with a series of US-backed right-wing dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years, until 1996. The coup has been described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.

> In 1953, A 2011 release of British intelligence files revealed that US and British MI5 forces overthrew the government of Cheddi Jagan, the elected leader of British Guyana. They showed how British spies kept up intense scrutiny on Cheddi Jagan and his wife Janet, who together founded the People's Progressive party (PPP) to campaign for workers' rights and independence from British rule for the sugar-producing colony in northern South America. Churchill and the US feared that the Jagans were communists, although MI5 found no foreign ties. Churchill dispatched a warship, HMS Superb, and brought hundreds of troops by air and sea to secure key sites. An outraged Cheddi Jagan appealed by telegram to Britain's opposition Labour party for help. Leader Clement Attlee replied curtly: ""Regret impossible to intervene.""

> In 1928, the Columbian army killed ~800-3000 striking workers in Cienaga, Columbia, after the US threatened to invade with U.S. Marine Corps troops if the Colombian government did not act to protect the United Fruit Company's interests, in the Banana Massacre. The banana plantation workers were demanding written contracts, eight-hour work days, six-day work weeks and the elimination of food coupons. The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets, and after a five-minute warning opened fire into a dense Sunday crowd of workers and their wives and children who had gathered, after Sunday Mass, to wait for an anticipated address from the governor.

> In 1965, The CIA overthrew the democratically elected Indonesian leader Sukarno with a military coup. The CIA had been trying to eliminate Sukarno since 1957, using everything from attempted assassination to sexual intrigue, for nothing more than his declaring neutrality in the Cold War. His successor, General Suharto, aided by the CIA, massacred between 500,000 to 1 million civilians accused of being communist, in the Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66. The US continued to support Suharto throughout the 70s, supplying weapons and planes.

> Starting in the 1970s, a CIA-backed coalition of right wing governments in Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil, began Operation Condor, a campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, with the stated aim of ""eliminating Marxist subversion."" Victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals and suspected guerillas. An estimated 30,000 to 80,000 leftists or sympathizers were killed.

> In 1969, amid a collapsing economy, labor and student strikes in Uruguay, CIA operative Dan Mitrione initiates a campaign of torture and violence against the left-wing student group Tuparamos. Former Uruguayan police officials and CIA operatives stated Mitrione had taught torture techniques to Uruguayan police, including the use of electrical shocks delivered to his victims' mouths and genitals. It has been alleged that he used homeless people for training purposes, who were executed once they had served their purpose.

> In 1964, A CIA-backed military coup in Brazil overthrows the democratically elected government of Joao Goulart. The junta that replaces it will, in the next two decades, become one of the most bloodthirsty in history. General Castelo Branco creates Latin America’s first death squads, or bands of secret police who hunt down communists and political opponents for torture, interrogation and murder. Later it is revealed that the CIA trained the death squads. Thousands were tortured, and hundreds were killed.

> In 1958, The United States supported the Batista dictatorship in Cuba. Batista aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Eventually most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land. As such, Batista's increasingly corrupt and repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships with both the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts. To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace—which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations—Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions; ultimately killing anywhere from hundreds to 20,000 people. After the Cuban revolution, the CIA launched a long campaign of terrorism against Cuba, training Cuban exiles in Florida, Central America and the Dominican Republic to commit assassinations and sabotage in Cuba. These include the cuban embargo, and over 638 failed assasination attempts on fidel castro.

> In 1954, the CIA overthrows the democratically elected Guatemalen Jacobo Árbenz in a military coup in operation PBSucess. Arbenz threatened to nationalize the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit Company, in which CIA Director Allen Dulles also owns stock. Arbenz is replaced with a series of US-backed right-wing dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years, until 1996. The coup has been described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala.

> In 1953, A 2011 release of British intelligence files revealed that US and British MI5 forces overthrew the government of Cheddi Jagan, the elected leader of British Guyana. They showed how British spies kept up intense scrutiny on Cheddi Jagan and his wife Janet, who together founded the People's Progressive party (PPP) to campaign for workers' rights and independence from British rule for the sugar-producing colony in northern South America. Churchill and the US feared that the Jagans were communists, although MI5 found no foreign ties. Churchill dispatched a warship, HMS Superb, and brought hundreds of troops by air and sea to secure key sites. An outraged Cheddi Jagan appealed by telegram to Britain's opposition Labour party for help. Leader Clement Attlee replied curtly: ""Regret impossible to intervene.""

> In 1928, the Columbian army killed ~800-3000 striking workers in Cienaga, Columbia, after the US threatened to invade with U.S. Marine Corps troops if the Colombian government did not act to protect the United Fruit Company's interests, in the Banana Massacre. The banana plantation workers were demanding written contracts, eight-hour work days, six-day work weeks and the elimination of food coupons. The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets, and after a five-minute warning opened fire into a dense Sunday crowd of workers and their wives and children who had gathered, after Sunday Mass, to wait for an anticipated address from the governor.

> In 1966, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows he widely popular Pan-Africanist and Marxist leader Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana, inviting the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to take a lead role in managing the economy. With this reversal, accentuated by the expulsion of immigrants and a new willingness to negotiate with apartheid South Africa, Ghana lost a good deal of its stature in the eyes of African nationalists.

> In 1965, The CIA overthrew the democratically elected Indonesian leader Sukarno with a military coup. The CIA had been trying to eliminate Sukarno since 1957, using everything from attempted assassination to sexual intrigue, for nothing more than his declaring neutrality in the Cold War. His successor, General Suharto, aided by the CIA, massacred between 500,000 to 1 million civilians accused of being communist, in the Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66. The US continued to support Suharto throughout the 70s, supplying weapons and planes.

It reduces the sound sleep needed for the restoration, renewal, and refreshment of the vital forces to the exact amount of torpor essential to the revival of an absolutely exhausted organism. It is not the normal maintenance of labor-power which determines the limits of the working day here, but rather the greatest possible daily expenditure of labor-power, no matter how diseased, compulsory and painful it may be, which determines the limits of the workers’ period of rest.

Also I can argue the US, purposely through its imperial apparatus, finds benefits in keeping the social mobility of other nations far lower than that of the US to exploit cheap labor and cheap resources.

With this I came to realize that the socialist transition state before communism would engage in massive amounts of technological advancement coupled with that distribution of technological advancement in the form of infrastructure everywhere.

With the IT revolution, the capitalists took the tech and piecemealed it. The ISPs gobbled it up and charged exorbitant prices while neglecting rural communities because capitalism needs customers. Gates and Zuckerberg and Page shafted the possible openness of the Internet where anyone could host their page and content and consolidated viewership. This lead to horrific incidents like the Myanmar government using Facebook to manufacture consent among the populous to support a genocide against the Rohyinga.

Socialism_101,foia2l9,t3_g7e90m,1587781919.0,"There’s this great clip by [Michael Parenti](https://youtu.be/6gtUaGV6mNI) that discusses why socialist regimes of the past became authoritarian.

Mainly due to the capitalist countries constantly attempting to sabotage the newly founded socialist republic. Any slight opposition or disagreements among workers could be seen as an opportunity to exploit by outside capitalist forces. Especially in Latin America, the CIA had its apparatus entrenched among the populous where even if there was a successful movement the CIA could delegitimize it with death squads.

The authoritarian nature of the capitalist class forced newly founded socialist states to build instruments of state power that made mistakes many times."
AskLeftists,foefhu3,t3_ek7j0s,1587702495.0,"The affinity to harm another individual in a society is predicated on probability governed by material conditions.

If you live in a war torn society where rule of law has fundamentally broken down and people are fending for survival, you will more likely have animosity towards others and won’t consider the moral implications of killing another for a sandwich if you’re starving.

If you live in a resource-rich beautiful landscape where the temperature is always favorable year-round and it’s always sunny and there are cute friendly cats everywhere to pet, as well as psychedelic mushrooms naturally sprouting up everywhere, then you will more likely form a cohesive social atmosphere.

By fundamentally striving to improve material conditions through rapid promotion of technological advancement and distribution of that technological advancement equitably in the form of infrastructure placed all across the society (transportation infrastructure, climate infrastructure, medical infrastructure, educational infrastructure in the form of libraries and schools, et cetera), the probability of committing crime decreases significantly. Laws won’t be needed because we know that the individuals in the society in their given state and material conditions will have a 0.000000000000000000001% chance of murdering or raping or stealing in 10 trillion years.

The only problem now is “What if a sociopath or a psychopath through his/her charisma leads a bunch of people to support harmful destructive tendencies?” This isn’t necessary illegal but is harmful to the self-preservation of a dynamic thriving inquisitive and creative communist society, so what do we do?

I always believed that if there are actors that are unsymbiotic to each other due to their physical configuration (a charming sociopath to the rest of society, a lion to a deer), then a democracy has the complete right to alter the configuration of the predator/parasite to produce symbiotic relationship. The sociopath is biologically treated rushed with feelings and joy and empathy and finds no drive for greed and uncaring power. The lion and the deer become friends exchanging highly interesting philosophical discussions.

In summary, we fundamentally target the reasons crime happens instead of trying to place a bandaid."

We have to target the ruling class, and it’s not going to happen through electoralism.

The objective is to have the structure in place for when a revolutionary situation happens. A crash, a war, a huge scandal, a party imploding,the fucking coronavirus, the constant material conditions reaching a tipping point, electoralism failing the working class again, all of the above. When it comes there should be a working class party organized outside of electoralismand with clear strategy ,structure and connections to take advantage of it ,recruit and channel the revolutionary spirit and struggle toward the right direction.

For visibility here is a step by step example organizing strategies. Of course a non electoral leftist socialist party is required. Join one or push your dsa chapter towards one if the dsa is reformable

•	⁠First: Print out a map of your operating region. Let's say it's a large metropolis like New York City
•	⁠Then, research the poorest, most crime-infested, and dangerous parts of the city. Highlight those parts in red.
•	⁠Then, find the richest, most prosperous parts of the operating region. highlight those sections in Blue.
•	⁠Debate among your band, which of the red segments you'll choose first. This will be your center of operations, you'll focus all your attention here.
•	⁠Next, gather information. Commit a map of your territory to memory. Interview as many people as you possibly can about local issues, about the nature of problems in the community. Learn about every pothole, learn about every piece of graffiti, every crack house, every local gang, every intersection in desperate need of a stop sign, etc.
•	⁠Develop an action plan to win over people in the community. If they're worried about kids lacking education, offer to have free tutoring sessions. If people seem concerned about graffiti, then offer to clean it up. If poverty is a problem, run a food drive. Make sure all your efforts stay exclusive to the community.
•	⁠It's important that structural problems are addressed within the community, however. The goal isn't to provide charity, but to uplift and organize the community such that it can start tackling long term problems on its own.
•	⁠Long term problems are things like crime, failing infrastructure, education. You can tackle all these things initially as organizers, but the goal is to give these people the tools to start tackling them themselves
•	⁠Once you undeniably win over a plurality of the community, start to organize them collectively. Develop assemblies where they discuss problems and tackle them on the basis of direct democracy and direct action.
•	⁠Upon a community forming a fully developed assembly council and making it through a full election, split off like a beehive.
•	⁠Part of your organizational structure will go to another red zone and will repeat the process there continue until all the red zones within your operating theater are organized
•	⁠Once they're organized, link them together in interdependent charters. Essentially the goal is to make a web of communes that wrap around the blue sections and can share resources and labor with one another.
•	⁠Divide the blue sections into islands, such that they're isolated in a sea of soviets
•	⁠Once an operating theater is sufficiently organized, move to the next one. Another town, another county, another state, another region.
•	⁠The goal is to create a web stretching from sea to sea and bound together with one idea and common party lines and coordination
•	⁠You can use whatever tools at your disposal. Elections, militancy, strikes, protests, legal battles

All and all when the system starts to fall down you are in a better position than almost everybody else"

You realize that our fundamental political institutions were created by degenerate land-owning white men who cried murder for having to pay more taxes for a war they eagerly pushed and has been propped up by greedy and narcissistic businesses inter-sectionalized with the racism and misogyny and the other forms of discrimination that bear the DNA of this country to this day? You realize that the radical movements of the past to extend rights also tried extending fundamental economic rights but were sidestepped in clandestine manners so that later generations would be brainwashed with notion that these movements were solely grounded in identity politics?

We should be seething with anger to the fact that these faceless coward ruling class members have led to so much misery and suffering no different from the feudal lords and the tyrannical monarchs and that electoralism in a system where these parasitical scum dominate with their capital will make it impossible for any ultra-progressive to garner any form of legitimacy.
