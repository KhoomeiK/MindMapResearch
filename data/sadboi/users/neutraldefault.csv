unpopularopinion,fq1ubgv,t1_fq1s6tm,1589049448.0,"Function and meaning are two different things, tho!

The word 'the' doesn't have a meaning, but it has a function (determining a definite noun). That is called a 'function word'.

Words with meaning such a 'literally' are 'lexical words', or words that build up the lexicon of a language through meaning. They have meaning and function.

In the sentence ""I'm literally starving"", we are using 'literally' as a function word, so it is devoid of semantic meaning (although it has pragmatic meaning).

However, the fact that you don't like it boils down to personal preference, so I cannot really argue with that. Opinions are opinions, my field of expertise is Philology, not Philosophy : )"

There is the semantic field (the actual meaning of the word inside the sentence) and there is the pragmatic field (this encompasses not only the meaning of the word, but also the social context, the tone of voice and many other surrounding factors). Semantics is only a FRACTION of Pragmatics.

You are considering 'literally' only from a semantic point of view. However, language is way more complicated, for example:

- Sarcasm ('yeah, right' = 'no'/'I don't believe you')
- Slang ('cool!' = 'great' and not 'cold')
- Intensifiers ('that's fucking cool' = 'that's extremely cool')

See that, in the case of intensifiers, the word loses its original meaning and becomes an emphasizing adverb.

The same applies to 'literally'. ""I'm fucking starving"" = ""I'm literally starving"" 

You're struggling to understand the meaning of 'literally'in those contexts because... well... because it has no meaning. Just a function - emphasizing. It' kind of an ironic use of the word, since it ended up with a seemingly opposite meaning, but that's the beautiful part: language can be so creative, you can turn it on its head and it still makes sense : )

Thus, he grows resentful... while making friends with their superior in rank (Liutenant? Idk), who is also very bigoted himself.


When the non-human PC's friends are apprehended, the Space Nazi tells the Liutenant that the PCs support the non-humans. The Liutenant then devises the whole firing squad scenario to prove their loyalty.

Maybe they have close non-human friends who are accidentally in the location of  a 'terrorist' attack, and get taken prisoner without questioning, while the humans in the scene are released. Later they hear in the news that their innocent close friends were executed to set an example (or they are going to get executed and need rescuing). Could work for a revenge plot!




About the XP system, I'm playing a kind of milestone campaign based on missions. 1 mission = 1 reputation point. Level 2 needs 1 Rep, Level 3 needs 2 Rep, and so on. Of course, my missions are really short, 1-3 sessions each.

 Maybe your rebel factions could assign them some missions at the beginning and they can climb up the ranks until they are in charge of the faction (the leader heroically dies and the PCs get chosen as new leaders because of their good reputation!).

Two things you need to know: magic is called Aether, the 5th element of the Universe, but scientists (technomancers) use it as a kind of electricity. Nothing magical there. Gods are just myths. Magic is nonsense.




So, before the Great Migration in which ""humans"" arrived to Auralis, there were already tribes of other species living in the galaxy. One of them is the Aegyptians (I needed an easy name for them and they have pyramids, so yeah). Aegyptians are true direct descendants of a God, so their blood is an important source of Aether. They are the only race who can be mystics... and their ""technology"" is very archaic.



At some point there was a Resource War and they were hunt for their blood and almost went extinct. Now they are protected as an endangered species.



THE IDEA IS: The illegal cargo is Aegyptian blood. Somebody somewhere has an Aegyptian-slave blood farm for profit. Money or saving poor tortured and scared tribe people - I'll let them choose!

 The two points of view are difficult to reconcile sice they are complete opposites. However!

unpopularopinion,fjblj1k,t1_fjbk39j,1583196007.0,"This comment is really nice, because now I can see why our opinions are different! It's in the way we interpret characters.

1. IMO, Walt never ""changes"". He was a coward, proud and selfish mess at the beginning, and a bad person, only a repressed one. He had many oportunities to stop but he didn't because of his hubris, and the worst of all, he lied to himself disguising his selfish desires as being ""a sacrifice for his family"". So no change - began as a bad person, destroyed many lives, destroyed his own family, ended up as a bad person.

2. Hank, on the other hand, has ALWAYS been a good person. Yeah, he likes to brag, but he understands his wife's problems and is always kind to Walter and his family. His bragging is just for show, though, since we can clearly see that he has anxiety problems even before he goes to El Paso. He takes a turn for the worst after the accident, but recovers. He is actually one of my favourite characters! (I didn't say I did not like the show, only that it was overrated). I DID like his dynamic with Walter at the end, because he is the only honest character that Walter could not manipulate with his bullshit excuses (cancer and family boo hoo).

3. I guess the ending was not poweful for me because I wasn't left with those questions: Walter was a bad person and he got what he deserved. He killed many people and destroyed his own family. Tbh I was cheering for him to get thrown in jail for the rest of his life, but he got lucky and died. Oh well. F*ck him. The least he could do was going back for Jesse, and tbh asking Jesse to kill him was a dick move.

4. I enjoy subtext and character-centric stories, not action. I guess my interpretation was just different than yours and that is why I didn't find it as engaging!
