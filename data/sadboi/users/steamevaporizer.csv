When I'm not in the city for a few days during the week for studying an socialising I just watch Netflix YouTube and play games on my phone all day just to be barely above the ""not bored"" line. It's sad really. It doesn't excite me anymore or anything to do this. But it's the only thing that doesn't make me feel bad. Well I do brake it up with creative work which occasionally steps through the door of my consciousness and takes over but when it passes its back to the same ol routine.

Like I realise what's going on when it happens, which is that I'm just in some empty feeling state literally not doing anything of value. But in those moments it's the only thing that works. It's really weird actually now that I write about it."

Technically I'm correct since the differences between two different songs are infinitely precise which means there is a difference between any produced song no matter what. So if you produce one song in lets say a thousand slightly different ways and you had the original song one song of the thousand will sound the most similar to the original song. You could repeat this process until there is practically no doubt the song was produced this way. This means any song contains the instructions for its production.

The bigger problem at least for me as a fairly smart individual is that people don't fully understand my showerthoughts or don't get it at all. I think people like showerthoughts they could have come up with themselfs under certain circumstances."

de,f3tyzma,t1_f3t61xt,1571149388.0,"Ich versteh überhaupt nicht warum sich irgendjemand überhaupt die Mühe macht die Politik der afd zu analysieren und zu bewerten. Das ist eine einzige Bande von Opportunisten, die die technologische Bildungslücke zwischen Jung und Alt, zwischen Land und Stadt ausnutzen wollen.

Alles was die sagen ist mist genau wie bei trump. Da gibt's keine Politik es geht nur um billig erkaufte politische Macht. Hölle nochmal wenn ich nicht einen Funken Moral in mir hätte würde ich das vielleicht auch machen.

Natürlich sind auch ein paar echte Motivationen dabei wie die Attitüde der Alten, lieber einen schönen unbehelligten Lebensabend zu haben anstatt sich mit irgendwelchen Dingen wie Einwanderern oder Klimaschutz zu befassen. Allerdings würden solche Aspekte in einer gesunden Gesellschaft überdeckt werden, da sie nicht gut für das gesamtwohl sind. 

Die Politik hat sich einfach stark verrechnet bzw niemand konnte diese Krise voraussagen: erstens die boomer Generation. Dadurch gibt es extrem viele alte Menschen, sogar unter Rücksichtnahme auf die generelle Alterung der Gesellschaft. Das ist mal das Grundproblem. Was aber im Normalfall auch nicht so tragisch wäre wenn sich unsere Technologie nicht so derartig schnell entwickeln würde dass die langsam lernenden nicht mehr hinterherkommen. Jene die technologisch hinterher sind werden immer weiter abgehängt (das Land, bestimmte soziale Gruppen und viele alte Menschen) und dazu kommen als Kirsche auf der sahnespitze die vorher erwähnten Krisen also Klimawandel etc. 

All diese Faktoren führen dazu dass es eine große Gruppe von verunsicherten, technologisch ungebildeten (und damit leicht ausnutzbaren) Menschen gibt die ängstlich und wütend sind weil sie sich abgehängt fühlen. Das Potential zum Umfeld-induziertem bzw. angelerntem Rassismus das in jedem Menschen ist, von den meisten aber mit rationalem Denken kontrolliert werden kann, spielt hier im Bezug auf die Immigranten natürlich auch eine prädominante Rolle. Und wird von der afd benutzt um ihre Wähler unter sich zu einen. Die afd benutzt natürlich noch ganz viele andere gewiefte Taktiken um diese Gruppe an Menschen zu ""afdesieren"" es ist manipulation auf höchstem Niveau. 

In Amerika nimmt diese Gruppe fast die Hälfte der Bevölkerung ein. In Deutschland sind es glücklicherweise nicht ganz so viel. Was auf Faktoren wie geschichtliche Vergangenheit, Bildung etc zurück zu führen ist."

relationship_advice,f3a9bft,t3_dg5t7v,1570765152.0,"I think you should write him a letter. Take your time and fully write out all your thoughts regarding this issue to him. Don't leave anything out. Tell him basically what you posted here and add anything that you feel like it is important. Tell him how it makes you feel and ask him some key questions. Also package the dad abuse theory in there but be mild about that.

No matter how he reacts it will very likley be better for both of you. There is obviously an unspoken conflict between you two that has been building up over decades, literal decades and light has to be shed upon it. (excuse my dramatic wording there lol) 

He may get angry in which case his anger will make him say all the things he feels towards you which will be the beginning of the healing process. He may also have some completely different reaction it's probably impossible to predict how he will react but it will be good for both of you I guarantee that. It may also cause some sort of intense short term conflict but after that one is over things will be way better than before. 

Trust me just open up to him and confront him in the most openly non aggressive way possible. Don't make any accusations towards him although from your writing I don't really get the sense that you would do that anyway. 

You don't know what happens but it is bound to happen and if you write him a letter you give him enough space and time to think about your words. Be brave and take a leap of faith! From my experience being open is always the best way in these kind of situations. And trust me I have 5 siblings and there have been a lot of conflicts within our family but we were always very open and confronting about I which is the only reason why it actually works these days regardless of the fact that we have the best setup to have eternal relationship splitting conflicts. So I have a lot of experience in this regard. And I assure you this is the best way."

Showerthoughts,f36t10f,t1_f35uc6x,1570717062.0,"Look here's the thing there are two possible ways of approaching this:

1. In the first scenario or realm of thought nothing is certain I can't prove anything that is based on observations. So I can't prove that the mosquito thing is possible, just observing the reality around us because nothing can be proven 100% if you move in this realm. But since my brain is based in the laws of nature if I can imagine it, it is possible. Now addressing the speed of light thing: well I can't prove anything based on observations in this realm of thought so you can't prove that a rock moving at double the speed of light is impossible in this realm of thought it definitely is possible. Or at least the indefinable construct that the interdependency between words and visual imagination creates is. 

2. In the second scenario or realm of thought we ignore the fact that you can't prove anything based on observations which is the realm of thought we move in most of the time since otherwise we wouldn't really get anywhere. Here in this realm of thought you can prove 100% that the speed of light can not be exceeded with our current observations (this can still change in the future with new observations but that's besides the point) but in this realm of thought I can also prove that the mosquito thing is 100% possible based on simple logic and observations.

In any scenario I'm right and you are wrong. Unfortunately."
Showerthoughts,f35s9ey,t1_f35rccr,1570688425.0,"No if you weren't trying to use it like that you wouldn't have said it at all.

Yes and I'm trying to tell you that I do too!

Yes I can again with simple logic. It is obvious that a virus can evolve that can kill humanity. It is obvious that this virus could evolve in a mosquito. It is obvious that this virus could evolve in a single mosquito. It is obvious that a random human being could kill that mosquito. Look I don't need to measure anything in order to prove these facts I can just use simple logic.

Also if my brain which is a computer that acts within the laws of nature can imagine this scenario then that scenario is possible within the laws of nature. Not only that, by imagining the scenario I actually briefly created a short lived universe in which this happens. Any scenario I simulate inside my brain is just as real as this world. Reality is just the combinations between different atoms and that's what happens inside my brain. Theoretically we could also live in a simulation. Theoretically some super intelligent being could just be imagining this whole world right which is why we exist, the second it stops imagining us we cease to exist. Does that mean that we are less real? No becaue reality is everything there is and that includes any kind of thoughts. So if I can imagine the mosquito scenario it is already reality and thereby obviously a possible event as a result. And also I shouldn't have to be telling this to a mathematician. But then again I guess being good in the field of maths doesn't necessarily apply to being qualified in any field of philosophy. So yes I'm sure you know a lot about maths and maths is obviously very closely related to philosophy however in practical reality it is not the exactly same realm of thinking. So please stop walking through the door with your math degree over your shoulder when you enter a philosophical debate it just makes you look stupid and insecure honestly. You aren't moving in a different realm of logic just because you know maths the realm stays the same and I can understand any argument you are trying to make so don't try to use that in order to superficially elevate yourself to a higher position in the discussion. Someone who's actually sufficient wouldn't do that."

Yes maybe I shouldn't circlejerk like that. It's definitely a character flaw. But if you don't think that intelligence is a burden then you haven't experienced what social consequences it can create for the person holding it. Now part of these consequences are definitely due to my character I agree on that! And part of it is due to intelligence. I can get frustrated and annoyed very quickly when people don't understand my point. It is a burden in the sense that most people don't understand what you understand and that can really mess with your head. When people don't understand aspects that seem so simple to you it's hard man. It's hard to deal with for me. And also ok you agree with me as you said right? So you try to explain to these people. I mean maybe it's the way I do it but most of the time the people don't get it and will disagree with you. Irl I have to swallow down so many things I want to say because I know from experience people will not understand and people will start making fun of you due to their insecurities so tell me again that's not a burden. Do you know how often I have been made fun of when making a smart and inventive comment/observation? As I said I am aware some of it is due to my character traits but a lot of these character flaws where created due to the very same reasons I was just talking about. Actually I don't even know why I'm still doing these online philosophical battles it always ends like this. This is the first time in a while I have done something like this actually. Sometimes I make the mistake of thinking things have changed but nope. Look these days Irl I can convince any person most of the time. I don't remember ever loosing a philosophical discussion, maybe with my brother but that doesn't count since he is the same as me. But online it's still a different story I don't know exactly why I would have to take time to think about it to list all the probable factors. Hm well I don't even know why I'm writing all this right now maybe I'm just bored or maybe I do it to pump up my ego who knows deciphering humans decisions and reasons why the do things is one of the harder things. Ok maybe I should just stop at this point I already see a shit storm of depreciating comments rising on the horizon."
Showerthoughts,f35drbg,t1_f35bns4,1570674911.0,"Do you mean me by the other guy in the comment section? Regardless: Firstly most of what you generously layed out for everyone is being understood by everyone so you could have saved 75% or your writing. Secondly the comment you put so much effort into has bad structure it is very hard to actually get what your actual conclusion is. So what's up with that? It's mostly just words without any real substance. Quality over quantity is a good thing to mention here.

Now addressing the actual, small amount of substance your comment has: you are saying we can not prove that the mosquito event has a probability of occurring above zero. Well I disagree I think we can actually prove that it has a probability of occurring that is above zero. (here comes actual substance) With the following argument: I can imagine it happening. Our brain is just a computer that acts based upon the laws of nature. So anything I can imagine is based on the laws of nature. Also theoretically me imagining the whole event already created a short lived parrrallel universe in which it happened so actually it already happened at least a couple thousand times because people imagined the event when reading the post which is also a form of reality. The point is anything that we can imagine assuming there are infinite universes exists. Because anything we can imagine is based within the laws of nature and the laws of nature create the realm of all the possible events there are. Our brains don't act outside the laws of nature they are a part of it. That doesn't mean that there are events that are possible that we can't imagine however it means that anything we can imagine is possible. But I don't expect most people to understand this. And it's ok if you don't."
Showerthoughts,f35agsl,t1_f359zhx,1570672479.0,"*Sigh* no I was also talking about the virus and op used the term ""probably"" which indicates that he sees that as a likely event. Well if that is a likely event in his eyes then some other mosquito also carrying a virus that could kill the human race and that mosquito not being stopped by a random human, thus spreading this deadly virus is even more likely than the scenario op painted due to simple logic. BUT we know that's not the case since you and me haven't been killed by a virus. So the term probably just shouldn't be there and without that term the showerthought isn't interesting anymore. Therefore this whole showerthought is complete nonsense or put differently this showerthought is only attractive to stupid people that can't make out an obvious logical error and the fact that this showerthought has this many upvotes makes me question the intelligence of the human race or actually it doesn't make me question it at all I'm actually used to most humans being not smart enough to realise something like this.

Youre sentence is correct however what I'm saying is that with simple logic I can argue that the mosquito thing lies between 1 and 2 if we are using your example and this should be obvious to anyone with a brain. So yeah."
Showerthoughts,f358iyh,t1_f35818m,1570671085.0,Firstly you didn't prove me wrong you only think you proved me wrong. Secondly sometimes it just gets too exhausting explaining the same basic principles over and over. If you read the rest of my comments on this thread you will find an answer to your argument. I guess I'm sorry I was being a dick.
Showerthoughts,f358c7j,t1_f356u8k,1570670949.0,Haha I know dude. The burden of being smart. In these philosophical discussions on online forums it is often so complex that people can't follow with their conscious mind anymore so they rely on their emotions. You don't know how often I had to experience that first hand. But we shouldn't complain too much I mean galileo got combusted due to the same principle. All we get are a few downvotes so it's ok :)

Showerthoughts,f357vjo,t1_f355kjd,1570670612.0,"The point is the laws of physics decide what that interval looks like. And we are saying that we can argue with the help of simple logic that the possibility of the scenario we are discussing lies within that interval. So you're just wrong.

Look sure there is a very small possibility that we are wrong but there is a very small possibility that everything anyone has ever said is wrong. If you argue like this then we don't need to argue because by your argumentation we can't say anything for sure. Which would also include anything you are saying which is a paradox in your argument.

Simple logic tells us that the mosquito thing is within the interval of possible values our numerical system can have. Therefore we are obviously right and you are obviously wrong Mr. Math major."
Showerthoughts,f3575i2,t1_f356g86,1570670100.0,"No that is also wrong unfortunately. The laws of physics are always the same. Now that doesn't mean that there are universes where laws of physics can be observed than are unknown to us but there can be no universe where the laws of nature contradict our laws of physics. Now it is possible that our laws of nature are altered due to the possibility of ous living in a simulation meaning living in a world that was created by other intelligent life, however our altered laws of nature will still be based on the actual laws of nature so no. The laws of nature will always be the same. But this guy is still wrong, just your point doesn't show that unfortunately. (I appreciate the attempt though! (no sarcasm))"
Showerthoughts,f3569dh,t1_f355q9v,1570669463.0,You're just a joke dude
Showerthoughts,f3563rl,t1_f353rkx,1570669351.0,"Youre not the only one who has studied maths lmao. And if you have to say that to gain credits in a logical argument then that's just sad and your degree is wasted on your philosophical realm. That's like saying my iq is higher than yours therefore I'm right which is what stupid people say. Do you really want to be one of those people that tries to win arguments with their self induced labels? Pwahaha seriously I don't know if I should laugh or cry. 

And yes that's exactly what it means. If that wouldn't be the case then who or what decides what universes exist and which don't? That's right nothing. The only thing that decides are the laws of nature. And if something can theoretically exist within the laws of nature assuming there are infinite universes then it exists.

There is no hidden algorithm that sorts out some universes. And if that was the case we would live in some form of simulation which would alter the theoretical frame in which we are moving argumentatively."
Showerthoughts,f3556y9,t1_f3541fj,1570668701.0,No I think you don't even understand what I'm saying
Showerthoughts,f3554ix,t1_f354zhd,1570668655.0,Yes I can with basic logic.
Showerthoughts,f353c9b,t1_f34y1br,1570667390.0,You are right! Don't let the stupid people tell you otherwise.
Showerthoughts,f35379k,t1_f3508e6,1570667292.0,Wrong. If there are infinite universes then all universes that are possible exist. That's just basic logic. So anything that's possible exist. And a man killing a mosquito that carries a virus that could kill the human race is 100% possible. If we can imagine it it exists (assuming there are infinite universes).
Showerthoughts,f352prs,t1_f34yx9e,1570666946.0,No that's wrong. If it's infinite then the probability is 100% period.
Showerthoughts,f352gwu,t3_dfniad,1570666777.0,If that was the case then there'd probably also exist a mosquito that could kill the human race but we're not dead so this showerthought is just nonsense.

relationship_advice,f34avfc,t3_dfiq05,1570652010.0,"It must be really tough loosing your partner in that way. She is still there still the same person more or less but her mental illness overshadows her old self and makes the person she once was vanish.

I'm really sorry this is happening to you!

My advice would be to think about the following aspects: Do you think you have the strength and capability to make her change back to normal? (by somehow applying therapeutic measurements on her). Do you think she can have a baby? Do you think she will go back to normal when she has a baby? Also how long is the miscarriage ago? Maybe she is still griefing and needs more time to process it. The situation is very complex tbh. I'm trying to take all aspects into account its just a lot so bear with me. It's possible that she has received unrepairable damage to her psychology. There are three possibilities:

1. The psychological damage is irreparable

2. The damage can only be reversed with professional help

3. The damage will pass with time by itself.

You have to make some judgements. It's also important how much you love her and how much effort you are willing to put in. At the end of the day it's your decision. I will tell you this, with enough effort and planning I think you have a good shot at healing her damage if 2. or 3. are the case. But it will be a troublesome road. You will have to be smart patient and persistent. You will have to think of ways on how to get her the professional help she needs and if that doesn't work educate yourself enough to deal with her issues that you can get her to go to a psychologist. Another option would be for you to seek professional help. I'm sure there are institutions or individuals that support people with partners that have psychological issues. They will be able to give you advice on how to deal with your wife and possibly fix her. I hope some of these ideas can help you.

As a conclusion: in Germany we say ""where there is a will there is a path"". I'm sure you have the capabilities and possibilities to heal your wife. It may be super hard though and at the end of the day it's your decision if you want to make that effort. And you wouldn't be a bad person if you decide not to help her btw. No one necessarily expects you to do this. After what has happened most people would obviously understand. YOU have to decide for yourself and do what is right for you. I wish you good luck."
LifeProTips,f345pah,t1_f345fia,1570650348.0,Lol true. Well I live in a fairly save neighbourhood and my door is basically always unlocked and has been for 20 years and no one ever broke in. (I live in my old family's house atm)
LifeProTips,f3458lv,t1_f3450na,1570650200.0,That's true I guess. You have to take that into consideration as well. Thanks for pointing that out.

WhitePeopleTwitter,f2kwvd9,t3_ddnqr1,1570289965.0,Dude customer's can be so fucking bad. The mail box for our family business is right next to my bedroom. So I can hear every customer leaving a voice mail. Today I was awoken by this extremely bitchy sounding woman that was talking in a very complaining voice for no apparent reason. She told. My granddad (leader of business) to call her and sort it out. Then she called AGAIN a few minutes after leaving another voice mail saying that he really needs to call her soon. Wtf is wrong with some people.
