Arya exacting her “revenge plot” for the sake of family then fucking off to the west....why? (Not to mention her killing NK made no sense and didn’t feel earned either) 

Jon going....back to the north....why?

I read though some of the spoilers and >!with the mod he actually does get sober in-game (after the heart even where you take him to the hospital.) He won’t just revert back to his old schedule and drinking like vanilla game. It will modify his schedule and add some unique dialogue about his challenges with it. Like he’ll still go to the bar but less frequently to drink “sparkling water” and hang with Emily but it gives him more of a relationship with Jas and he can run Marnie’s shop when she’s out. Like I said I haven’t gotten there yet, just read the spoilers, but it looks awesome I’m excited to see how it unfolds in game!<"
