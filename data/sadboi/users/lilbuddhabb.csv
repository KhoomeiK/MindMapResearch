PornFreeRelationships,fr2rdox,t1_fr1s22k,1589842435.0,"I had to ask my ex’ friend to leave our house once because he kept trying to convince me that men, innately, are deranged sexual beasts who only eventually learn how to “silence the urges”. What the fuck? Were talking about human beings with a vast consciousness (potential wise) with the capability to grow and to absorb and relearn. And he kept refusing to acknowledge that men who actually believe that it’s within them biologically and that it’s their GOD GIVEN right to prey on any thing or person because it rushed blood to their dick on command - are the fucking problem with the world. I realize that’s the belief held in this sub, and although I believe that holding onto that belief restricts us from evolving and growing past it, I can’t stress this enough: I know men are beyond capable of unlearning their toxic sadistic ways and teaching their boys differently. I think there is a space to be offered to boys and men where they can explore the control the anger and all of the other things they’re told from a baby boy they must abide to as a man. 

I stray away from misogynistic types and from these types of conversations particularly around people I know are pretty narrow minded- this guy was immediately in denial of all of the ways women are hypersexualized and what it causes and how it affects, all just to rebuttal with “that’s just men but eventually you have to learn to grow out it” 

you fucking grow out of what, rape? Stupid. I asked him to leave. And then he texted me such bullshit, victimizing himself and shit. Boy hasn’t even had a job or gone to school since high school- ahem excuse me while the ADULTS talk. Like really, take your super biased uneducated sexist opinion elsewhere. I let you into my home and you think Ima sit here and let you talk about women like unfortunately our well being just  rests at the hands of men “growing out of” aggressive abnormal hyper sexuality. 

To be clear I’m not arguing with anything you say, just adding my thoughts"

BPD,fr03tsp,t3_gltx9y,1589782917.0,"I (21F) had a similar argument with my (half) sister (25). But the roles are reversed in my situation. I’m the one with the mental health issues from the violence and neglect I experienced, and she didn’t- being older she was out of the house more, and my parents martial problems didn’t really start until I came around (we have different dads, but my dad has raised her since she was 4). 

She said I deserved everything that had happened to me as a child. A child. I told her she was perpetuating generations of insane sadistic violence. I ended up blocking her and going no contact. It’s been... almost six months now. 

I went no contact with my dad around the same time for the same reason. He couldn’t listen to me at all. But as of two months ago I’ve been speaking to my dad due to a violent break up I went through. I ended up reaching out. 

Anyway, both my parents have tried to play it cool and plan get togethers for the family since. And I’ve said things all the lines of I’m okay, thanks though. I’m not sure what you guys think this is, but it’s not that. 
I’ve allowed my dad in my life so far since because he’s been going to therapy and showed a will to get better, and to support me. It’s been a bit too close for comfort, but I’m still working up the nerve/finding a way to talk to him about distance without him breaking down and turning the whole thing into him saying i think he’s a monster, no one loves him, that he does so much for us, etc (as our conversations have gone before). 

All this to say that you don’t need that energy in your life. Stick by your boundaries. They’re what’s gonna help you heal. We can’t keep being the bigger person and allowing space for everyone else to walk comfortably while we silence our needs.
People will talk down on everything you’ve done without ever taking the time to understand you, why bother explaining to people who dont even have the intent to listen. I made plenty of mistakes, plenty of errors that were human. Plenty of situations where I never had the skills to make the better choice or have the best reaction. And it’s not our fault. It’s not justified. But I personally can’t heal when I’m surrounded by people who only want to paint me red or whatever that saying is"

SJSU,fqzzzs3,t1_fqzx46i,1589779813.0,"Thank you so much for the feedback. I have also heard about UCB not liking admitting students from their school into their graduate programs because of bias and all that. 
I’m admitted for Global Studies, so technically it wouldn’t be the same department that I want to get my Masters in. I’d like to assume that might make a difference. I have reached out a few times to the SW graduate advisor with no luck. 

I’m realizing now how expensive the graduate program would be at Berkeley compared to SJ state. I’m not sure if financial aid extends into your graduate degree? 

But if the case is that I’ll have to pay almost three times what I would pay at SJSU (I have also heard great things about the MSocial Work at SJ) I’d probably opt to go there for my graduate. Leaving me to have some fun at Berkeley while it’s mostly paid for. My dads gf currently got her both her degrees at SJSU, she worked for the county and they paid her salary as well as paying for school. 
I’m told that kind of thing works the same way in all near by counties. 
When it comes down to it, my belief is that it won’t matter where I got my bachelors or masters, as long as I have that credential, recommendation, as long as I gett the MA. 

I’m not too interested in research so I’m not hesitant to let go of the combined M/Ph.D program at Berkeley. It was nice to hear that Berkeley is more industry focused. I might just accept tonight!

And it makes me so uncomfortable. I’ve tried to enjoy social media my way, but it is honestly very difficult to not EASILY get sucked back into the allusion everyone else is participating in when explore page after ad after whatever is more of the same. I also try explaining the same thing. And here I am, scheduled to get a nose job in two weeks (it’s been pushed back three months now since April), and I know what I’m doing, and it’s truly painful and heartbreaking to know why I am doing it, but my reality is that I am so uncomfortable being myself around so many fake people. I got out of the main city but even still, that’s where I grew up. All of the people on my tl are from there. I can’t go on social media without having two or three of the girls from high school with thousands of followers (I used to be one of them) will follow me and instantly my trek backwards begins. There IS solidarity in it all, there can be absolutely, but.... these days things are really fucking wack. Twitter ! I can’t go on there without seeing porn/ a vagina within three minutes of opening it. That’s never been the case for any social media platform before ever."
AskWomen,fqmz9ct,t1_fqmw9k6,1589486014.0,"Our relationship is over now. But it’s taken me a while to see things clearly. I don’t have many people to talk to, so I never opened up about the issues we were having. It ended up exploding, and it ended in such an aggressive way that it was hard for me to see anything but the pain I felt for losing him the way it happened, the things he said to me, the rejection. Today, with your help, I can see a lot clearer that he was not meant for me. He was familiar and he offered me that space, but I don’t think there was anymore to it than that towards the end. I saw the signs everywhere but I never acted on them. It was long past our expiration date. It was extremely hard for me to accept my reality, because it happened so violently and there was so much rejection I was experiencing, he knew about my CPTSD and still treated me the way he did. There were a hundred other ways for him to communicate that he didn’t want to be with me anymore. Whenever I tried to talk about our problems, he never wanted to. He’d get upset quickly and end up screaming at me and blaming me for all of the obstacles we’ve encountered in our relationship (family, school, wasting the past three years of his life with me), and when I would beg him to please stop, he knows what he’s doing to me, he would scream fuck your trauma even louder than my cries for him to stop. We’re in different places. We bonded over pain. I don’t think either of us had ever met another who saw the pain we saw in each other as transparently as we did. It’s what grew us close and grew us apart. The only problem is I didn’t love myself enough to take care of myself when I needed to- When he mocked my methods of healing, my spiritual rites of passage, when he never asked me to go out and do things outside, when he got all silent and moody at parties with friends bc I’m outgoing and he’s not, when he let his family disrespect me over and over, and never stood up for himself or me. As someone with cptsd i need a certain level of commitment and boundaries. his family crossed all of them and he didn’t have his own. 

Thank you for sharing this with me girl, I sometimes just have to let my stream of thoughts out as it’s two months post break up but i’m only barely gathering my strength"
AskWomen,fqmr5sa,t1_fqm9zo0,1589482153.0,"I completely agree with you. I’m very open minded to all that, I have opened up the conversation of watching porn together, etc. I’m all for exploring sexuality and feeling the most in tune with ourselves and our desires/needs. But when he constantly, without even realizing, is staring at every woman’s body that walks by, while holding my hand, to the point where they’re looking back at him because they can feel him ogling, is a problem for me. He didn’t even know, so there’s no intention coming from him to just admire or glance and move on. It’s subconscious, and I think that makes it more of a problem. The go to is to constantly objectify women (he grew up in a very hyper sexualized environment). His expectation and standard of women was that of practically hentai. He’s attracted most to women with fake, dramatically curvy bodies. he doesn’t seem to ever have a relationship to the female body that doesn’t involve objectifying it, rather than seeing bodies as bodies. Then again, he was a virgin at 18, and I was the only one he’d been with sexually. Extremely naive of me to think he’d be sticking around longer than whenever he got tired of having sex with me. Which is exactly what happened. He told me he thought I was ugly, and he had been picturing the girls from high school that he wanted to have sex with as me while we had sex cause I didn’t do it for him anymore. 

And I asked him to STAY. which is another story. I begged him to explain what was happening, he explained his struggle with his masculinity and with his shallow thoughts, and he decided to stay (even after taking the time to scream at me after I got angry with him for what he said, he decided it was the perfect time to unleash every problem he’d ever had in our relationship, things I’d never heard him mention before. there was a LOT of gas lighting. The next few weeks that followers were awkward, there was no sex, and occasionally he’d remind me he still thought I was ugly. And I had to look at him and say, I think if you stopped saying those things out loud it would help you get back to feeling that I’m beautiful, like maybe instead of telling me you think I’m ugly how about you tell me I look beautiful? Can you believe I’m so stupid?? Anyway. 

I had plenty of experience with sex and dating and guys before him. He didn’t. I was open to having a three some of that’s what we were down for, but I wasn’t down for the fact that he hid/was unconscious to his objectification of women and that he (his words) was extremely conflicted about whether to be with me, or whether he should be with a Kardashian lookalike like media shows him. 

I am all for honesty. I am all for doing shit together, like talking about a strangers attractiveness. He just never really made me feel like he chose me. And that’s cause he did, for a bit, but there definitely came a time in our relationship where he didn’t want to choose me anymore"

I’ve always opted for independence, an extroverted soul at heart. But sometimes I speak and I’m just like, God I hate when I speak. Sometimes I waiver over the way I laughed two hours before at that thing my roommate said, or question how silly or nerdy or unsure of myself I may have sounded when I spoke, and I think it’s what you describe. Through this reality of violence I’ve felt pressured to try to be normal like my peers, and I’m starting to think I’ve just been copying what I see instead of being myself all this time... 

It’s a strange self awareness to have, i think for me it kind of induces more anxiety. we have to practice doing things for ourselves... 

i like to say “you’re probably overthinkin’ it” in a funny voice to myself when i can’t shut myself up"
CPTSD,fqc7xq8,t1_fqc2vby,1589252011.0,"Maybe the answer will come when we stop comparing ourselves to normal people. We’re simply not normal, and there is a world in which unconventional can be embraced, we just have to make it for ourselves. I hate the word normal, because honestly everyone is weird. There is no normal, imo. But there is judgment. It’s clear to me that the longer I spend thinking I’m lost, I’ll feel lost. But maybe lost isn’t really lost, and it’s just a new heaven? A new playground to explore? I’ve strived so hard to live a “normal” life like the majority of my caucasian peers, growing up in the suburbs didn’t mean I lived like them. I’m little by little piecing together the parts of me that have always been lost, and trying to give myself a safe space somewhere- in a hobby, in a song. I think trying to be “normal” is one of the most pressuring feelings. Constantly looking for ways to not drown in the strange reality of violence that was ours, by living through friends, wanting what they had, wanting to be like them, fighting everything that pointed to my identity. It’s all quite depressing to think about for me, but if one wants to make it out we have to create it for ourselves, right? And there are no rules or guidelines in our world, where things have never been normal. 

I’m not not sure yet, where I am. I’m just lost. I hope social work will be good for me. But I hear where you’re coming from, and I think that that’s only fair, it’s only right- to not be so frivolous in who we give empathy and understanding to. I worry that I won’t be able to keep the chains on the love I want to give others- but I experienced a love of someone who didn’t want to get better this last time. They did the same to me. Scapegoating you to preserve themselves, so they don’t have to look at themselves and their actions. I worry I’ll never learn how to be weary of people, and that I’ll just keep giving myself away, and end up like the homeless woman I saw. That’s why I wanted to offer her warmth so badly. 

These places where we grew up, the people that we once knew (they never knew us)... it’s all so foreign. If getting up and leaving this identity behind meant leaving behind the pain too, I would. But the pain and the needs that I have will follow. The shut down followed a string of violent fall outs and I sit around, feeling so stagnant. trying to and barely taking care of myself. trying to find a reason. and Id like to think that this is one.

CPTSD,fqc0376,t1_fqbto6s,1589247361.0,"I am right there with you, darling. I hear you. 

I agree in that I think it would take someone just like us, to love us the way we want to be loved. But how true is that love and not just a constant taking and feeding off of one another? If we can’t love ourselves, how will anyone else ever...

From my encounters, people tend to use me as a stepping stone for growth because I offer them empathy and cultivate their love. I’m tired of being the safe space that everyone else needs, that I’ve always wanted.  I chase after people who are doing just fine, who left me, who didn’t care to keep me in their life, and I end up humiliating myself. To me they are family, and to them I am a stranger they could easily forget about while I crumble apart without them. 
I’m tired of hearing people praise and glorify trauma, with the expectation that you’re gonna be such a profound amazing individual after healing. that or you end up a crackhead, right? I’m tired of people telling me there’s something different about me, something special. We’re special and different until it no longer suits their curiosity, until they actually have to try for us. Until the moment when simply glorifying and romanticizing the trauma we’ve experienced is over and now they actually have to confront it, and offer us a safe space, too. 
I too think about giving it all up. I think there is a point where people fall... and there’s no getting back up anymore. 
I’m grateful that I’m not there, but I can’t help but think that that’s what I ultimately see for myself. 

I’ve taken psychedelics a few times, and once, on LSD I saw a homeless woman crossing the street- I instantly bawled. Her head was bobbing up and down dramatically, her mouth was moving erratically, her hair was a big dark knotted mess, she wore these raggedy black drapes, and was pulling a black suitcase. When I saw her, I saw myself. Her pain and her energy were so strong and dark. If not dead, I can see myself ending up like her. Alone, sanity gone, living in filth on the streets. Teetering on the edge of death for a long time. I’ve compared my manic states and ptsd symptoms to the feeling of tripping. A few weeks ago due to violent events, I was looking around and I swore I was in hell. A hell that looked just like my real life. I couldn’t believe my reality. My mental state so fragile. I couldn’t accept it.  
So when I look at a homeless deranged woman on the street, I want to love her and offer her safety, while others see her and only think about maintaining their distance so they don’t “catch a disease” or have to walk past her or something like that. It’s an empathy that surpasses everyone else’s basic sense of self love and preservation. We cannot keep offering unconditional love to everyone. We can’t keep exploiting ourselves. And yet that’s on the path I’m on now. I’m a junior in college (my second third year), and my plan is social work. 

But I’m scared, every day, that I’m going to fall apart and give in, that I will continue to let myself down, and that I’ll leave this world behind without ever getting to experience unconditional love. It’s strange to say “let myself down” when it was never really us who let ourselves down in the first place was it? We never learned how to keep ourselves up to begin with. I’m taunted by the idea that letting go, of everything, might be the best thing. Sane, like you said."

Yup 👍🏽 I cant believe to what lengths I’ve gone to explain to several people who literally don’t care for what I have to say, that’s literally my biggest flaw. Not caring about myself enough to see that no one here saw my clarification, saw the confusion among other people, saw people gaslighting me by pulling fragments of my OP and twisting it to their benefit, always leaving out the part that explained how it was always in regards to my experience. I clarified and they didn’t care. If I wanted to, I could tear your response apart and respond just like you, point by point, just to prove to you oh HOW wrong you are, as it’s clear was your intention. Your response was ridiculous, and I will not tolerate such shit. Your language, speaking on my behavior, which you literally do not know what you’re talking about because otherwise you would have been specific about it. Like I said, I would NEVER. To all of the responses that I got on the OP which I removed (which you imply that you DID NOT see so no, I’m not assuming that you didn’t see it) I stand my fucking ground and I will curse and yes be angry because it’s been a load of shit- I would NEVER respond to people esp HERE the way they did to my OP, a fucking progress post. But it’s ME, right? it’s all me. Yes, I do in fact believe that I was told by a mod that they can understand my frustration but I should report the comments instead of engage. I do not care what you think at all about the situation, but I posted it on BPD ALSO and NO ONE there replied how they did here. I actually got gaslit on reddit and now I’m supposed to be the bigger person. Because some people didn’t bother to read through the comments and don’t care what I have to say anyway, cause the second you say something people don’t like, you’re just wrong. Even if they didn’t fucking understand what you were saying in the first place. this whole thing is so gross. But yea me swearing means I must be stupid or just in the wrong? I’m sorry to say I now know what the mods are talking about when they refer to inappropriate behavior, especially for this thread. Your initial response in itself proved my point and I’m sure you can’t “step back and try to see where I’m coming from” though like you suggested right? Cause I already did that shit, respectfully, on the OP, and guess what, they continued to harass me and take offense even after I clarified. and that’s what i wrote about here. Oh my god. Yeah I’d say shit like this is why I consider fucking offing myself. 

I love how after your very condescending initial response, which, if you don’t think that was condescending, tell me what you would call someone who says this to you “it appears multiple people are telling you your behavior is unacceptable and you’re refusing to listen” about something they didnt even know about entirely or even a LITTLE, without FIRST stopping to maybe ask for insight? The first go to reaction to a person who posted that multiple people took offense to a post of theirs - which by the way it was only TWO PEOPLE - one who asked and I clarified for the other who continued to take offense - is to tell them they must definitely be the one who needs to take steps back. I’m disgusted but not surprised. But looks like you LOVED grasping onto MY use of “multiple people”. Anyway, as I was saying, I love that after your first initial condescending remark, you come back like “let me assess every part of your message so you know I’m smart. And I’ll even be kind and say things like I never intended to come off as condescending, and even as go far as offering soothing advice, after I write that I regret having written at all.” Yeah, I hope I do find a safe space, I thought this was it. My OP was me doing that. But you had to come in, saying, that my behavior has been deemed unacceptable elsewhere without you even being there and are there to regurgitate it. Fuck."
CPTSD,fqbny3i,t1_fqajdky,1589240564.0,"We seem naive and quick to hope that this newfound stranger will love us like we can love them, and how we have always yearned to be loved: unconditionally. That this stranger will become the family we have always hoped for.

Enough that I don’t idealize every person into being that for me, just so they can remind me that not everyone is as fucked up as me, and that some people can’t understand me, because they lack the skill or experience like you say.  
I’m the only one looking to fill a deep dark hole, I need to love myself enough that I’ll be the one to fill it. But how? With strength and support that I must pull from the depths of the oceans and the moon, the living things that continue to work in regard to me, and I in regard to them. Strength from the depths of ourselves, to pick ourselves up again, and again, and not let ourselves keep falling and get hurt.

BPD,fqbk5yz,t3_ghqcxp,1589238502.0,"I do the exact same thing. I go 500 extra miles for everyone close to me on their birthday, always hoping they’ll reciprocate (never do). I literally drop hundreds or spend hours putting something nice and unique to them together. It’s bizarre. Since I was so little, at birthday parties I bet people must’ve thought I really wanted attention or something. But I REALLY just wanted to make the special persons day like unforgettable and for them to know they deserve it cause they’re theM- aha. I want to share an experience of mine that has to do with this. 
I opened up to my now ex about this a few weeks before my birthday as it was coming up. Birthdays are hard. Most of them for me I’ve spent punished, in trouble, thinking I’m just a bad kid. 
When my birthday came up, he didn’t write me a card, or anything else. He did nothing. We live together, and he worked full time at the time, but was home usually by 4 pm. This was my second birthday while in a relationship with him. He asked me what I wanted to do when we both got home from work that day. I sat down and tried to explain to him that I didn’t feel he had put any effort into this day, and that I was pretty hurt, esp because I had also talked about all of that with him shortly before. 
He, as his own person is quite defensive and does not take any criticism well due to constant criticism from his family growing up. So we end up arguing? And then he gets up, and he walks out of the house. After a minute or two, I ran out to him, and he was gone. I call him, he turned his phone off. I didn’t know that though, I was sure he’d just as well blocked me. 
I’ve been abandoned several times as a child- my first and least violent example of this is 3rd grade when my dad locked me out of the house and told me to leave and never come back. when i didn’t leave he threw me in the car and drove me to a highway entrance, he told me to get out. I was holding my moms barrette I had found in the back seat, he saw and told me to leave it because he didn’t want me to remember the family. He told me to get out and that he never wanted to see me again. 
So I struggle with those types of actions of my now ex, walking out and turning his phone off. And he also knew that. It was my birthday, and I was already hurt. 
I broke down- just like that little girl in 3rd grade. The pain and panic that becomes me is too fucking dark and dramatic. It’s fight flight or freeze. It’s traumatic. I thought he just left me because I wasn’t good enough, and that he wasn’t coming back, and that I was being abandoned again. It hurts me to write about myself in that state. He finally turned his phone back on, and his mom who I had texted and asked if he had reached out to her (since I didn’t know where he’d gone) had driven to our house even after I told her I’d let her know when he was back and she’d said thanks. She hated me by then because my ex helped his mom financially and him moving out with me meant I took the codependent son she thrives off of. 
So she was there, and bc of all of the negative energy she’d been radiating at us by then, I asked him to walk back home so I wouldn’t have to see her when they pulled up. I was outside. We lived with roommates. When my ex finally came back, his mom texted him that I was a cunt, and she was fucking done with me. She didn’t know at all about my state and even if she had known I doubt she would have been any kinder. 
I wrote all of this because we just barely broke up about two months ago, and it was a very violent ending, and I’ve been scapegoated. And I don’t know if I should’ve ended it there, or if all of this, everything bad in our relationship, was my fault due to my actions, my reactions, just like he says, you know? I‘m really still just barely catching my breath these days, trying to self regulate. 
i also hope that it’s helpful for others if they’re ever in similar positions"
CPTSD,fqbe9lf,t1_fqbcaey,1589235382.0,"I think that you have assumed rather largely about my “behavior”. I was speaking on part of my experience about my self, about things in mY life. When the confusion was made clear and I clarified, specific people continued to take fragments of my OP without including the explanations that followed it. What I’m seeing now from a community of people meant to be supportive, is an extremely harsh way to CLARIFY information and now assumptions on my behavior are being made. That’s incredible. I took the time already, to do exactly what you say, and then people continued to not CARE about what I had to say, because they were so caught up in wanting to be right about something I wasn’t even trying to ARGUE. I was onlY speaking on MY experience and my healing. This is incredible, to say the least. I already took the time to be respectful and clarify, I mean, it’s insane that that’s what I wrote about and you jump to the conclusion that I’m a complete hypocrite who can’t take their own advice.  What the fuck? Thanks for proving my point. I can’t believe that from what I wrote, these are the responses. But I guess people here are SO quick to judge someone who wants to “complain” about a response as the person who is so deaf to everyone else and even their own advice. I’m unpleasantly surprised by the overwhelming amount of assumption and condescending tones that I have received as I do literally NOTHING but defend MY healing and my mental illness and my experience with it as my OWN, putting it out there for whoever it helps, take it. And for those who don’t understand or take offense, at least I wasn’t fucking rude, like the people who responded to my OP acting like they knew exactly what I was talking about when it was so clear they didn’t understand. 
The way you touch on my “unacceptable” behavior when you did not read the OP or the responses is beyond fucked up. I would never. The nerve, to speak so boldly on something you know SO little about. I didn’t post this so people would give me their opinion on a post that’s no longer even up, it’s a post to spread awareness on how daft people can be."
CPTSD,fqb2fdj,t1_fqb0f6q,1589229399.0,"The controversial statement I made, I ended with, “For me.” But no one really seemed to get that right? That what I was writing about was my own experience, not telling others what to feel or what’s right from wrong. I think my post is more than just a complaint, and I think it’s just noise to you. See how I use, “I”? They’re not facts, this is just what I think."
CPTSD,fqav6kw,t1_fqashmh,1589225842.0,"So it must all come from your completely unbiased and completely knowledgeable perspective, knowing everything about my life, reading everything I read, and still taking a few short fragments just to say “You’re felling people this and that” and denying people this and that. Bruh, you’re MAD and that’s OKAY. Be real. You took fragments of my op that you clearly DID NOT understand and used them to validate your position, which practically has NOTHING to do with mine. Stop critiquing. You kept responding when I kept writing the same thing over and over.
So here!! The explanations you don’t deserve but continued to presssssss me for cause you need me to change my thoughts to coincide with yours. I’m 100% positive you could have alluded to the possibility of genetically inheriting BPD without invalidating MY experience. I was not invalidating anyone else’s- I simply shared light on my perspective and I thought it might HELP some people. But that’s where you go back and say I said “saying cptsd and bpd to a bunch of people with bpd is one in the same is blah blah blah”. Did you elaborate on my explanation that I wrote after that? How it was that way specifically, for me? Nah. But okay. You’re mad. You found the one thing here that didn’t work for you and stuck to it, congrats"
CPTSD,fqatso4,t1_fqashmh,1589225158.0,"Just so you know, I posted this under BPD as well with the title “take what works for you leave what doesn’t” 

so thank you for creating such unnecessary energy here- my cptsd has been around since i was very young, and I never allowed myself to believe I had ptsd. So when shit started hitting the fan and I found myself looking for answers again, BPD forums were incredibly hopeless and fucked up places to read about people suffering. So my therapist finALly confirmed for me that I in fact yes do struggle with ptsd I have for a very long time. so FOR ME, that’s the way it has worked. 
You’re not angry? yeah okay, what word would you use then ? Upset ? Bruh"
CPTSD,fqat32v,t1_fqascws,1589224806.0,"sir. you have 0 credibility. this is reddit. Google? Oh yeah.... that’s a great place for information- if you know how to check your sources. Have fun “googling” about how BPD is genetic. I will continue to talk formally with professionals on the matter, and continue to have my perspective on the whole matter as I did. Are you happy now? You didn’t get what you wanted right? Does this feel like a huge waste of time to you yet? Cause your first comment I just thought wow- someone here is reading through this and thinking- “what is she saying how could she say that” 
You’re the one assuming and generalizing snippets from my OP to benefit your point that was not asked for, but could have been elaborated in a much less rude condescending way don’t you think so?"

That’s how they developed in MY life. I would love to elaborate on what I mean by that and on why my ex’s therapist did him wrong, but you are not to try to understand.

Oh my lord well you made me chuckle. I keep telling you it’s my fucking opinion like, OKAY? what’re you gonna say next? my OPINION isn’t gonna change based on the research I have done and the discussions I have had with real in person professionals, not random fucking redditors here to stake their healing inversely out of mine.

Please, enjoy your path to healing, this is mine. I’m not criticizing YOU or anyone here but the people in MY life. wow. 

How about you write a letter to the APA and ask them to make sure those studies are in the god damn curriculum ?? 

This is MY fucking experience with MY psychiatrist MY ex HIS therapist. I will not explain to you WHY what she said to him was extremely uneducated in a world of psychology where it’s so stigmatized, I will not explain to you EVERY other factor and layer of it- this is my healing, my progress, please see yourself out"
CPTSD,fqapyxa,t1_fpucuzx,1589223268.0,"I’m not diagnosing anyone, I literally only wrote my experience, for those who HAVE heard of BPD, like my title explicitly states. I have said repeatedly, my OPINION on the matter with the information I have gathered. Am I going to drop everything I’ve learned and discussed with professionals because someone on the reddit  pulled one statistic out? No 🤷🏽‍♀️ 
The stigma is real, the symptoms are real, what’s it’s called doesn’t really even fucking matter to me, I was just bringing attention to the negativity around BPD especially when it’s confronted by psychiatrists and therapists. Thanks though"
CPTSD,fptzwh8,t1_fpsaw4l,1588901697.0,"Trauma does not have to be specifically outrageous traumatic events. As far as I have researched, which is quite far, and conversed with multiple therapists on the topic- it simply is a matter of opinion to many psychologists. In theory it has not been accepted. Bpd is multilayered, I understand that. Trauma is different for everyone. For me particularly, it has been significantly violent events. For many, there is no physical violence at all. Among many psychologists BPD is not regarded as a real thing at all. So I can definitely argue my point, but as I stand to say, it’s an opinion. You have yours, as does every psychologist and researcher out there. Ultimately, people who are labeled as BPD have complex post traumatic stress disorder. the word complex there is important. And because BPD is so stigmatized and delegitimized among professional psychiatrists and psychologists, my particular therapist explained the work before stemming from cptsd. The threads on BPD literally feel hopeless. Because usually, those situations are hopeless, people with no control who may not have ever had control in their lives, and other things. The way it’s talked about currently, it’s simply not beneficial to anyone. And that’s the main problem. The fact that a person with BPD can be avoidant or impulsive etc is true to that disorder and the specific clusters. It is in itself it’s own disorder. But the way I see it, it’s one in the same. My symptoms of cptsd are the same as those from BPD. That’s me."

I literally feel like I’m teetering i’m the edge of a panic attack every moment. At night, when I take it, and I get in bed to sleep after an hour or so, this wired feeling begins all through out my body, and just grows strong to the point where I HAVE to move my body, I have to sit up, it feels like I’m just going to explode. I feel it more in my body. I just started my period today so it’s going to be a hard first week to up the dosage and see if the anxiety is getting worse or what. I stopped birth control like two months ago because I wanted to see how I feel off of it given all the side effects that come with, so I’m just getting my regular period back.):"

AskMen,fo71egb,t3_g5zavx,1587570540.0,"I’d say that based on the fact that men place women on a pedastool alone, it’s clear that men believe picking one girl out of a hundred means that it’s that girls lucky day, that she should be honored to have been picked because she was “prettiest” among her sisters. I think that’s the most vital component here- the interpretation and expression of sexuality not how much. Women could pursue men the same way, but ultimately (most) women are not raised to nitpick every physical aspect of their partner, to be a voyeur among men, there is not a common exposed area to that of women as is rape culture among men, a culture that thrives on seeing women as lesser, and even then, putting them on a pedastool to behold and win grace over the rest of the bitches in the sea"

And my mom made that noise with her lips, that says like, youre tripping. and I said ""I don't know what you guys think this is, but it's not that"". It is unfortunate that the only two people I have to rely on right now are the two people who taught me best not to rely on them... But Im setting my boundaries this time and doing it right.
