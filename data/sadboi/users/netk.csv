AlanWatts,ewkm7n1,t3_coqdbv,1565488214.0,"Alan Watts himself has said the whole game is to figure out whether if or not to commit suicide. He argues as long as there is some mystery unknown the answer is no. This is why this ""feeling"" of the godhead is what feels like a ***hintergedanken*** –– a thought in the back of your mind, a suspicion, though not a certainty.

You could also consider Terence McKenna's point of view that history is accelerating and we are approaching a sort of singularity of consciousness. Consider there have never been as many humans alive as there are today and the number is rising. Could there be a threshold we are approaching? A tipping point of consciousness upon where new gates will be revealed and opened? Could this be related to the so called technological singularity? What of becoming a non-senescence species? Is ascension possible? Is this what the Buddhist predicted when they refer to Maitreya? 

So yes, that feeling, I also get it. Sometimes more acutely than others, but that only deepens the mystery. Suicide is just another thought, anyone has it. It is normal to ponder about your non-corporeal existence, at least once a day. Even with solid proof, what's the rush? It's not like I'm going anywhere! Your bit of consciousness is here for a reason. You've caused to set into motion endless and countless actions which will ripple thought time as invisible karma. Is that all you set yourself out to do when you chose to come here?

It may be impossible to save your friendship with Natalie after this, but it will not be your fault. Natalie could very well be forever grateful to you you allowed her to be the one to tell him, but she may not see it that way. In which case, you are not losing a good friend.
