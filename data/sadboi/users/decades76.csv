TalkTherapy,fiprvds,t1_finw1ke,1582618316.0,I think the tendency for the older generation to denigrate the younger generation is partly based in jealousy. I detest the term 'snowflake' because it demonstrates the lack of ability to listen and instead write off the opinions of an entire generation. Having said that 'Ok Boomer' isn't much better. But it also probably comes from learned behaviour and I think this is what I have been a victim of and what has damaged my self esteem.

When I do this, it usually involves the imaginary person being impressed or amused by what I'm saying, and I think I'm doing it for the warm feeling that gives me (dopamine rush?). I think this just serves to reinforce the unhelpful mindset that my self worth comes from the validation of others, something I am trying to move away from.

DecidingToBeBetter,fgdfkr6,t1_fgdd3aw,1580681981.0,"But there must be something else at play here. The journey's out on 'brain chemistry', but it goes without saying that consuming chemicals (either prescribed or illegal) can make you feel 'good', and then afterwards, they can make you feel 'bad'. This is the chemical directly affecting your emotions, and thoughts follow on from this. It's a lot easier to think positive if you're on antidepressants.

I'm not saying that positive thinking doesn't have an effect - it can certainly be helpful in some situations. But it is not always possible to positively think yourself out of every negative mood. This is the fallacy."

Happy people are often not very good at explaining how to be happy, because they haven't made the journey we have.

Psychedelics for introspection is what I was referring to about drugs, and I intend to try this but by no means see it as a silver bullet. As for religion, I just don't believe the fundamentals of them, but I could learn a lot from their philosophies, especially Buddhism.
