tarot,fmfjqru,t3_fuzqza,1586028697.0,"To save a long story very short; me and this girl have had a complicated relationship. She is inherently a good person, but she‚Äôs in a very toxic phase right now, and has been for a while. I used to hang with her a lot and I found that when I did, I was falling into toxic behavior and mindsets. There even was a point where my feelings for her negatively affected my relationship. I started to recognize she was bad for me and have been distancing myself. It‚Äôs been hard but i also see myself thriving and happier without her. i still miss her of course. And I‚Äôm a sucker for a redemption story..but alas. I can‚Äôt change her. I also can‚Äôt necessarily wait for her to change, sadly..

I‚Äôve wanted to do a reading to reflect on our relationship for a while but I wanted to approach it without any bias and a clear head. I definitely think that‚Äôs reflected in the reading in the present card: The Devil (reverse). It was very spot on in saying that I‚Äôve recognized her toxicity and my own toxicity as it pertains to her and have essentially dodged a bullet by distancing myself from her. She was my drug, she was someone that almost ruined my current relationship (because we had feelings for each other). So I definitely am taking heed of its warning to not take this lightly.

So with the Daughter of Pentacles and Daughter of Cups. I did some reading and could connect some dots but I‚Äôd love to hear other opinions/explanations! I‚Äôm new to this sub, but I read through lots of comments and was amazed by the feedback given to others. I‚Äôm a sponge! Penny for your thoughts, internet!!"

confessions,fk1fr40,t3_ffvdn9,1583778769.0,This really resonated with me because I fell in love with someone (way older) online as well. It was so real! No one understood what we had. I think it really helped me mature in a way that none of my friends did. It helped me develop deep relationships with people and fall in love with personalities first. It‚Äôs crazy what impact ‚Äúonline life‚Äù can have on your emotions and the people you meet and what you learn! I wouldn‚Äôt be here if I didn‚Äôt have my online friends/loves.

BoJackHorseman,fg72f1z,t1_fg71x67,1580582403.0,I think so. He always looked up to Secretariat. That was his role model. That‚Äôs who he wanted his ‚Äúdad‚Äù to be.

Acid,ffpmgts,t1_ffofb3x,1580098719.0,"My advice? I would test tripping in public like a concert / music festival first to gauge how your temperament is / self disciplined you are. Also just be aware of what your comfort level is/ how easily you can redirect a trip from going bad because those will be key elements when you go into a ‚Äúnot controlled‚Äù environment. No one is gonna know you‚Äôre tripping unless you freak out and make a scene BC everyone is doing their own things at parks ya know? So don‚Äôt worry about that. Tripping at a theme park is super fun! If you love coasters and are super comfy with them, go right ahead! And just remember to not get too freaked out when you go into rides with ‚Äúscary‚Äù elements, as most do have those. Bottom line is; try it! Have fun! Its an experience for sure, and having a Xanax(or whatever) that can diminish a trips intensity is a nice safety blanket to know you have just in case things go south :) buttttt the trip is what you make it! I had a blast, I bet u and your friend will have a bomb time for sure if you ever try it"
