benzorecovery,fjfrfoh,t3_fd6wz3,1583298268.0,".25 is a very small dose. You'll be okay. I have gone through both xanax and klonopin withdrawals. I was taking 2mg klonopin a day, and several months after coming off those started on about 4mg xanax a day if not more. They both sucked coming off of but xanax withdrawals was the scariest thing I've ever gone through. I have never gone through opiate withdrawals, but have witnessed them. I cannot say for certain which is worse but I would say my symptoms certainly looked much worse than what I've seen opiate addicts go through. Insane panic attacks. Didnt sleep for DAYS, cold sweats, severe tremors, collapsing due to my whole body going numb, hyperventilating, dry heaving, and lost 30 lbs in 30 days due to loss of appetite/extreme nausea. Klonopin is much easier to come off of since it stays in your system longer. .25 is very low to the point its rarely prescribed, so you really won't have to worry about withdrawals if that's what you normally take."

stopdrinking,f7l2cga,t3_dwrxwu,1573831361.0,I have been going through the same thing. I've been drinking heavily since I was 17. Now 29. My body is over it. I vomit and or get super bad acid reflux. Smoking weed has helped me a LOT with the nausea. Keeping as busy as your body allows you to be. Weed and tea have been my go tos.

Anxiety,f1h01ji,t3_d9eth1,1569482271.0,"If you are prescribed ativan you should have it on you at all times. It is meant for panic attacks and to be taken when you are feeling this way. You can let it dissolve under your tongue if you want it to work faster, but try to once use it as needed. I was prescribed something similar and became very addicted to it because of how often I 'had' to take it. Other than that just try to keep your mind off of it and maybe call a friend or just take a minute to sit down and sip on some water."
Anxiety,f1gytbs,t3_d9fszd,1569481454.0,"I could see that for sure. Therapy helped me a little bit when it came to a few things so it's definitely worth a shot..definitely try that before meds if you can. Something that your therapist might suggest also is getting a journal. I bought one a while ago and need to be better about using it. Basically write down everything you ate, drank, did and thought about shortly before you went to bed, and then what you dreamt about to see how they connect/effect each other. And if it's just you being a light sleeper and panicking over being woken up, maybe try some white noise in the background? I love my box fans, and the sound of my diffuser. If I forget to put on either I actually get much worse sleep."
Anxiety,f1gxisf,t1_f1gx949,1569480558.0,"I totally get not wanting to sleep, especially after being unmedicated I swear it's made me even worse than before. Is there anything specific causing the attacks? Or do you just wake up having them? Mine generally happen for a reason related to nightmares, lucid dreams, and/or sleep paralysis."
Anxiety,f1gwg6i,t3_d9fszd,1569479773.0,All the time. The only time it did not happen was when I was on medication for anxiety and depression. Or high. Or unbelievably exhausted. Since I have come off my meds I have been experiencing this constantly. Last night actually had it happen I woke up literally screaming and my heart was pounding so bad you'd think I just ran a marathon. I know this is much more common in people with severe anxiety issues. So my best advice to you would be to wear yourself out before bed. Make sure you are truly tired to the point you're not lying around thinking about things for hours before bed. It should help at least a little bit. Sorry you're going through this =/

mentalillness,eyut8zk,t3_cyx25b,1567471537.0,It is a part of who you are. And that is okay as long as you try to not let it take over your life. I'm not the best at managing mine but have found that allowing imperfections in your life does help. It will be uncomfortable but the world will not end..realizing that is the biggest step. A lot of people have OCD and are understanding of it. Talking can help also. I'd say leave meds as a last resort unless it is destroying your life.

Been diagnosed with depression and GAD and panic disorder..also been told to look out for bipolar. Also have insomnia but that kinda goes hand in hand with anxiety. I feel ya on alcohol n weed..always helped me. I will say one thing though..be very careful if you choose to get help. I got put on meds and stayed on them for years and they ended up doing more harm than good. Not saying yours would be just be careful and do your research before agreeing to take anything. First things first try all natural approaches. I have found that not napping and keeping busy helps me at least stay asleep for 5-6 hrs which is huge for me. I'll do a bunch of housework and walk my dogs as much as I can. I also work 5 days a week. Reading tends to tire the eyes. Then once you're actually a little tired try listening to meditations or relaxing instrumental music. I also put my oil diffuser on and the sound/light alone is relaxing to me. Box fans are awesome too for calming down a lot of people, myself included."

SelenaQuintanilla,eymrnaf,t3_bwy2km,1567217840.0,"Haha I go through racism on a daily basis. I live in a primarily Hispanic area of Chicago and am 75 percent white, 25 percent Honduran. I have loved Selena my entire life and am not racist at all, to the point anyone white in my life gets irritated by my lack of prejudice/racism. I have been in the same area for close to 10 years and before then was in a small town that was verrrry racist and prejudice against pretty much anything and everything against their 'norm'. I cant begin to explain how frustrating it is to have constantly stuck up for everyone, including those who are racist against me. It hurts and I wish life wasnt like this, but unfortunately MOST people are racist..especially in such segregated areas such as Chicago. On another note,  we had the most beautiful mural done of Selena not too long ago in my neighborhood..if only I knew how to post it lol"

AskReddit,eymkcdf,t1_eymjew5,1567211581.0,"Depending on how unhappy you are, could be a very good or very terrible idea. Dogs bring joy to people sure. But they also need emotionally strong leaders otherwise they will become unhappy themselves and that will lead to aggressive/destructive tendencies. I got my first dog 6 years ago which forced me to become more active taking her on two 45 min long walks a day which helped a little bit. I have also been on and off with major depression/anxiety and man, they really pick up on your energy. If I'm having an especially bad day, she barks at anything and everything. Pulls and is just all around more anxious. Best bet is to foster and see how that goes."

Well one day I was there really late and decided to use the bathroom before I left. I was so exhausted that when I sat down to go pee I felt nothing but pure relief being able to sit and urinate for the first time all day. After quite a lengthy pee I go to stand up and wipe only to notice I left my underwear on. I threw them away in the trash and wrapped them in paper towels so no one would notice."

depression,eyas0nt,t3_cwg3o0,1566968575.0,"I have been there. Except usually I think about driving off ramps? Idk lol but trust me there are other ways to feel. Healthy and unhealthy ways. For me punching or breaking things ALWAYS helps. Over the years I have gotten slightly better about choosing the right things to smash up rather than breaking mirrors or phones. One time I punched through a bunch of drywall that was being torn down anyway, and it felt pretty great. A better option would be a punching bag of course..but I'm just saying. There are plenty of options to give you a feeling other than death. Another thing that has helped me in the past is running. Hard to get the motivation but for me I eventually just had so much built up from anxiety and depression that I decided to run. And it felt great. It was almost as if I was running off all of the crap I had been feeling. Now my body is falling apart and I've been kinda screwed but those helped me when I wasnt physically broken lol"

Hes the same with my other dog. And thankfully they're both really good about it, other than my cat hissing no one ever gets hurt..but regardless I dont want to waste money on cat food that could get stolen by one of my dogs. Hes such a pain in the ass and the only reason all 3 of them have to be supervised for every meal. Once the other 2 are gone (they're older) I am not getting another hes just such a thief.

So he always eats between 6-7am. Then again when I get home from work between 2-4, and then a few hours later before we all go to bed. Another thing is he ONLY does this with raw. Never wet. And his wet food has been taken from my chi mix multiple times. I'm not really concerned it's just soooo strange. There are times when none of us will even be near him and I'll hear him take a break from eating just to hiss."

1. I get hot way easier than the average person.
2. My job does not have ac so the cooler it is outside, the cooler it is inside.
3. I hate sweating. My makeup comes off and I break out in both rashes and acne from the heat. Also I work with dogs. So all of their hair sticks to my body when I'm sweaty. Pretty gross.
4. Less/no bugs
5. The air smells clean and feels clean when it's cooler out.
6. Tea is just be best in cooler weather.
7. I love getting bundled up.

Now the true crazy has come out and my anger issues are back and I'm trying to keep to myself to avoid losing the few people I have in my life.

Soaked my sheets daily from sweating and didnt even have it in me to wash them because I was so exhausted. Got better after the 3rd week but was still suffering after then. I believe the half life of klonopin is longer than valium so that could be why mine lasted awhile n were worse. Either way I'm glad you didnt suffer, but you are very lucky. I've known many people who have, myself included and it is the absolute worst I've ever felt."
Anxiety,ewkn19n,t1_ewkm8kh,1565488851.0,"I feel your pain which is why I got on meds in the first place. What really helped a lot, at first, was paxil and klonopin. Eventually it got worse and they had to keep upping my dose. I've tried other anti-depressants but paxil is what helped me the most with anxiety at least. I suffer both depression and anxiety, but would much rather deal with depression than anxiety. I am still on paxil and it helps a bit, but is by no means a miracle drug. And the combination of the two only helped the first few months. I am not anti drugs at all but just want to make you aware of the risks involved. I was shaking in my bed for weeks, having muscle spasms, nausea, hot and cold chills..etc. it was realllly rough coming off of them and I tapered myself off of them.
