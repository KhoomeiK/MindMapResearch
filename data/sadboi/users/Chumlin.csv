But how would they stack up as true crime detectives? 

I'd love to hear them go deep into an unsolved true crime, interview witnesses and maybe even find a real life, totally real murderer!"

depression,ev4819m,t1_eugl5i8,1564209351.0,"Yep, feel this 100%. From the outside, it looks like I have my shit together. On the inside, I just don't feel. But judging from everything around me (Friends, loving wife, job etc.) I don't have a ""reason"" to be depressed, so calling it what it is just make me seem like an attention whore so I don't talk about it. I'm lucky to have a support network and I know that many, many more people have it worse than me but it's a unique type of shitty to deal with, I suppose. Luck to you on your journey :)"
