I've also had it where I wake up every hour throughout the night, e.g. 1.10am, 2.10am, 3.10am etc. I was freaked out by it at the time, although I since read somewhere that our body clock can be very influenced by our thoughts: so if we're fixating on a certain time, our brain stores that information, and we are likely to wake up at exactly that time because our body clock will think that is the time we're supposed to wake up. I can't explain the voice in your head, so I'm not dismissing that it could be something paranormal, but I've definitely had auditory hallucinations when very tired, so it could be that. I also think that sometimes when we wake in the night like that, we're still half awake, and sometimes sounds or words we think we hear are just remnants of dreams. Hope this helps you feel a little less freaked out, and hope this stops happening soon as I know how scary it can feel! xx"
phish,fhxj6ih,t1_f5qwpsr,1581955588.0,"Hi, I know this is an old post, but was just browsing for 12 Tribes mentions and found this. To answer your question, all of the people working at those delis also live in the communities, so have already been converted and are definitely involved. Each person in the 'community' has a different (unpaid) job, so some might be working at the deli, others on the farm, others teaching the children, etc. My guess is that all of them know about the abuse (but possibly not the corruption?), although I imagine that some of these things are hidden from newer members until they are 100% sucked in. I have a friend who joined when she went to do fruit picking on one of their farms. I lost contact with her for a couple of years and had no idea where she was, but have since been in contact and have visited her there. They certainly made attempts to hide things when I visited, as I was 'escorted' to the bathroom (which was down a corridor containing other rooms) every single time, presumably so I didn't snoop. To me, it was fairly obvious that some kind of hitting/spanking was occurring during the talk/sermon thing they had at their meeting, as every time a kid fidgeted or caused any disruption, they were taken out of the room by an adult for about 10 minutes and then brought back in. I noticed one girl rubbing her arm when she came back. I think these things were probably noticeable to me because I had done my research, but if a vulnerable person who didn't know any background visited, it would be much less obvious, and I can see how they would be lured in, as everyone seems very kind and friendly, takes a real interest in you, gives you loads of delicious food, etc."

I heard my friend's little sister calling my name from inside the ditch. I assumed immediately that she was in there playing, and I peered through the trees looking for her, but she wasn't there, and there was nobody else around, and no animals or birds that could have made a noise I might have misheard.

The only thing that works for me right now is creating a barrier so I can't physically do it, e.g. wearing gloves. The area I pick is my scalp so I also wear a hat.

I'm not sure about particular links for the free self care ideas, but there are tons of blog posts with lists of ideas. There are also lots on Pinterest, and also on Twitter under the hashtag #365daysofselfcare. The Blurt Foundation has lots of good stuff on self care - I think the thing that I found most useful there is that I realised sometimes self care is very basic stuff like making sure I'm looking after myself, eating something nutritious, drinking enough water, getting fresh air, etc. I realised that I don't do those things for myself naturally when I'm in a bad place, and it really helps to be reminded. :)  
Aww I hope you get some time and space to listen to some music soon! But even listening in the car is a great thing. Singing along is meant to be really good for you, and it always helps lift my mood.

suggestmeabook,fhpk5lk,t3_f3na63,1581791214.0,I think you might enjoy The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare :) xx
suggestmeabook,fhpjjaj,t1_fhpi9gz,1581790892.0,No problem :)
suggestmeabook,fhpjf1r,t1_fhlblo8,1581790834.0,Was going to suggest that too. :) Amazing book! xx
suggestmeabook,fhphui6,t3_f41hqs,1581789961.0,You by Caroline Kepnes!
suggestmeabook,fhphdhd,t3_f4bfoj,1581789652.0,I definitely recommend the Project Nemesis series by Brendan Reichs! Definitely has similarities with both The 100 and Stranger Things. I found it really addictive and read the books really quickly. xx
suggestmeabook,fhpguzm,t3_f41gxx,1581789314.0,"Hello! I would recommend Night Film by Marisha Pessl, and Slade House by David Mitchell (both creepy and with a strong sense of place, and Night Film also has some culty vibes!). I would also recommend all of Moira Fowley Doyle's books - creepy, strong sense of place, LGBTQ+ characters! Also as you like Michelle Paver, ghosts and historical fiction, any of Susan Hill's ghost stories (The Woman in Black, etc.) are brilliant! xx"
