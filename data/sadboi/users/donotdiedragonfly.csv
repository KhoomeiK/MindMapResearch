AskReddit,foymehx,t3_ga4gjx,1588175133.0,"Not quite as spooky as others, but I’ve had some odd coincidences in my life.

I lived in a small town in Massachusetts for the first eleven years of my life, then moved to a smaller town in Florida for my teen years. In middle school I met two girls, twins, who had lived in the same town in MA and went to my same preschool at the same time as me. Then moved to the same town in FL, and were in the same middle school as me.

The next one is in college. I went to college and shared a dorm with my best friend. One day we were at the grocery, and she asked me to swipe her card for her. I did, and she gave me the code. It was the same exact code as mine. We picked the same four numbers in the same order. A couple day’s later we decided that we should both change our code, I don’t remember why. We later found out that we again picked the same code. Now years later, we reconnected, and our cats have the same name."
COVID19_support,fowfmyb,t1_fovxor7,1588118839.0,"Exactly, and same. My roommates and I are doing everything we can not to get sick. We have everything that we need delivered. We haven’t gone out at all. We only go out on the back porch sometimes, we don’t even walk around the block anymore. Also, whenever we get packages, we spray them down with Lysol and put them in the garage for 24 hours.

We are doing everything we can think of to not get sick, but my older parents are still going out. I have way less anxiety about getting it myself than I do about them catching it.

I’m with you, the anxiety is constant. I love them so much, I can’t imagine living without them."

They don’t go out too much, supposedly, but I know they are still going to the grocery store and pharmacy sometimes. They also walk the beach, but they told me they are social distancing everywhere. They don’t even wear masks! I am so worried. So yeah, I think I know how you feel. It’s definitely been weighing on my mind."

It’s like, yes I’m in pain, yes I have trouble breathing, but no, I don’t want to take it off. If my body just was born the right way to begin with then I wouldn’t have to wear one.
