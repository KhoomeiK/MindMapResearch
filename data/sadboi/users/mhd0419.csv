Your perspective has led to the rape and sexual assault of multiple women at the hands of xy-chromosomed penis-bearers.

I have no idea why you care so little about women and are happy to see them harmed to benefit men.

What do you believe is pseudoscientific about anything I’ve said? Why do you believe that the necessity of identifying women in law, and hence protecting their legal rights, is “false”? It breaks my heart to see women failing to understand or care about how to protect other women from men."
Trufemcels,ex1zm3e,t1_ex155ei,1565959664.0,"There is no need for such rampant hostility, replete with swearing, finger-pointing, and name-calling, because I am calmly and politely noting biological reality.

When you let people who are physically men, and socialised with male entitlement, into women-only spaces designed for our safety and dignity (changing rooms, toilets, domestic violence refuge centres, women’s support groups, even prison cells) they will at worst rape us, at best make us feel unsafe and with nowhere to call our own. This has already happened, a lot, after society has allowed male rapists access to vulnerable women simply because said men have claimed to “be women”. It’s simply a matter of protecting women.

I feel bad for trans people who genuinely believe that their male body is a female body. Just as I’d feel bad for a white person who believed their body was a black person’s body, or a dinosaur’s body.

I am however not prepared to harm or demean women in support of that delusion.

If we lose any ability to define what makes a woman a woman (other than self-identification) we lose the ability to protect women in law. That includes literally keeping them safe (e.g. women’s prisons to be free from male rapists) and extends to maintaining quotas for women to represent x% of a corporation’s board."

EffectiveAltruism,eww8hic,t3_cqgqbb,1565822953.0,"I haven't weighted it in a rational way.

At present my monthly donations are mainly to animal charities. I think it's just because animal welfare tugs at my heartstrings the most. I also donate monthly to a couple of healthcare charities (one of which is a lottery, so I could benefit from it) and to Oxfam.

I will be organising and streamlining my approach much better in the future.

I will likely spread my donations and where possible my time among pretty much the causes you mention above (barring LGBT as I don't think the need is as urgent and I'm not really a supporter of the T part).

Remember your time is a resource and you can do a lot with that. From volunteering with old people in your community, to petitioning govts on behalf of Amnesty International, to raising awareness of animal rights issues and climate change online."
