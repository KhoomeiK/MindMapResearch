I don't find the 880s to have significantly higher treble, but I have no issue with 990s. So no headaches from me. 

Sound presentation is a bit different, but not enough for to warrant a particular description/comparison. Mid range, I find the 400i's to be a tad more forward/present , not surprisingly. But the bass is where it's all at, in terms of variance in ss. I've never enjoyed the bass in the 400i. It's there as a note, but lacks presence/slap/whatever you want to call it. The beyers are indeed quite neutral, but you feel and hear all. 

Regarding detail, you won't miss anything with either. They both have plenty, and honestly, I would expect more detail in more expensive cans, to simply translate more frequently into noise rather than some extra aura on strings or vocals or whatnot.

Also, it wasn't the dad who went as far as to not even acknowledge the troubled child (a being in pain and fear) but added literal insult to injury by using such prose as twat and fucking and kicking the child's bike. 
And I am not going to paint this picture any further, because, really, the most significant piece of social/emotional/maturity/responsibility/societal behaviour/empathy/cooperation/humanity, and lack thereof, is simply kicking a crying and frightened 6 year old girl's bike.

For your contentment, and the sake of argument, I will agree that it's the kid's fault, ergo her fathers, as, like you said, the convention of right-of-way, will defend those who are slower, on foot, etc. 

But like I commented elsewhere, many things were happening seconds apart during that *scene* that we now have all the time to dissect and be so wise about. 

Now to put those two men in the same category of having behaved badly - If that's all you take from that, something is missing in your observations or  social skill set."

Everyone must lead such a proper perfect life, with such high morals and standards. Gosh it's surprising you're not all famous and beatified by now. Such a pleasure and a privilege for me to be walking this Earth with you. How about it takes a village? No, right? because you didn't ask for the kids, you didn't sign up, it's not your responsibility. So much easier to come on here after the matter and point fingers. Always easier to point fingers in hindsight. Who listens to a little bell and ignores it. What's going through your head when you hear a little girl saying excuse me and ringing her tiny bell, and still you purposefully ignore her, don't turn around, don't acknowledge her. What emotions are you going through as an adult, what point are you trying to prove, that ends with a child falling to the ground, shaking in fear, as you belligerently swear and  ""stand your ground"" whilst coldly ignoring the distress of that little soul? Now you may think I might be reaching here, crossing the line, second guessing, but make no mistake, that poor excuse of a human, was delightfully enjoying the aggravation he caused, and he was thirsty for violence. That twist of the tongue at [0:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzw6cEZlbh8&t=56s) and the bike kicking are case in point.

There's no guessing here for me, for I have been on the receiving end of characters like that. He doesn't even once seem to acknowledge the crying girl. I don't absolutely adore kids, but nothing? That's a violent person imo . Btw the girl is ringing the bell right until she crashes into them"
