The problem isn't that it's talking to someone (it's not), it's having to sit and watch something for 30 minutes while the nodes on your head help the computer rebalance your brainwaves.

Yes, I know how childish it sounds that ""there's nothing I want to watch"", but here's the other problem with that. I can't process speech n e a r l y at a decent rate (I think I had to turn YouTube down to 25, 50 percent playback speed, which sounds horrible.)

You could make the argument ""well just find a video your interested in a turn down the playback speed"", but I only like accounting, and I'm not a fan of what I've found on YouTube, or Amazon, or Netflix when it comes to that subject.

I just...i don't know what to do anymore. And it's literally not my fault."

(honestly it was I who reached out. We speak maybe once every 3 to 4 weeks).

While their Healthcare system is definitely better than mine (thank God they don't live in the states), it's been, unfortunately, nothing but a wreck. We waited a year for them to see a psychiatrist and it turns out, he (the Psych) was absolutely useless. Told my ex to just simply stop doing the things that were upsetting them.

Here's the thing. It's okay to have a condition and not be normal. Doesn't mean your worth less as a person, just that you have struggles that others don't. Going around and saying ""THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME JUST ACCEPT ME"" isn't helpful. You can accept and love a person as they are, but acknowledge there's a difference, or a problem.

It's good you have found a balance for you. After being on 9 different meds, I cleaned my system out in August and haven't tried any since. It might be useful to try again one day, but for now I'm going to try other things (like neurofeedback).

Pot...actually makes my dissociation worse. Had it with my ex, and had the most intense episode of splitting off I had ever experienced (Actually went to the emergency room, but left since I was a foreigner visiting from the states so no insurance). CBD oil on the other hand definitely helps with the physical stress but - if I'm blunt - alcohol works faster on my system. 

I appreciate the 'be yourself' encouragement, the problem is though is that my actual self is so...not likable. That's not trying to be self deprecating either. It's complicated.

AutisticAdults,fiftewt,t1_fifqhre,1582393077.0,"Definitely not descriptions I've heard about myself. Everyone I know thinks I'm great, when in reality I've just faked my way through and pretended to care and be nice since I was 12.

Problem is, when I do things I want to do, it becomes incredibly difficult to want to dissociate again. So with that, it's just easier to stay disconnected constantly than go back and forth between the states. Plus, it reminds me how cold, unfeeling, and bratty I am internally, and since I've had enough real world experience to know that's not good, I stay disconnected and play pretend.

To clarify about the threat, my parents have never threatened that. That's a claim I made to myself. Trust me, my parents have done nothing but try to help (hence the notion of freeing them from me).

It is my therapist, yes. I went and sought her out myself.

I could leave, but then no one would let me live for free with them, and I'd be living out on the streets if it wasn't for my parents. So no, finding new surroundings isn't a good idea."

While 'broken' may be a strong word, I understand that it's not normal or good to not have empathy, or to not care about others. I guess hence why I used the term.

I've been in therapy for 9 months now, and quite frankly I got sick of talking, so parents and I are trying Neurofeedback. The problem with talk therapy, was that since I didn't want to do it (executive function), I had to disconnect to do so, which resulted in it being somewhat meaningless. I guess on a 'positive' note, I do have a therapist who's aware of my situation, who has experience working with autistic individuals, so I do have that. Just right now, I can be forward and honest with her (the therapist), the issue is the attitude and behavior of ""I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE OR CARE""."

If you can, I would recommend going and getting a formal evaluation done. This can help ease that anxiety of being unsure. 

Having autism/being autistic doesn't have to be a secret. You can talk about it to whomever you're comfortable with, or not. It's really no different than having any other medical diagnosis, so just allow yourself to decide on your level of comfort in sharing.

I would also say, be kind with yourself. Take your time. Getting diagnosed can be a great relief, a shock, or both. It's totally okay to go through any grieving processes (if you feel like you need to, if not, kudos!), but don't just focus on the negatives (I really struggle with that if I'm being honest).
