StardewValley,f93a4em,t1_f939wnt,1575053760.0,"I can see what you mean; even though I didn’t have that problem myself, I get it. I really enjoy playing it on mobile personally but PC is IMO obviously the best especially since you can have mods and you get the updates first. Mobile is great if you wanna take Stardew with you. I don’t have a switch so I can’t really comment on that."
StardewValley,f938w1y,t1_f92uhrh,1575052860.0,Combat is imo ridiculously easy on mobile. It auto attacks monsters faster than I could click. What problems do you have with it?

AskReddit,f89jadt,t1_f89idwk,1574374051.0,"Jealous of what exactly? They popularized very specific types of surgery. Huge fake asses and giant lips. Never said they invented it. This shit is all over Instagram and no I’m not jealous. I’m upset that so many young women and girls (and boys too) feel as though they have to get surgery to try and look like a Kardashian. Especially when they all rely heavily on photoshop and look very strange and even kinda gross unedited. And plastic surgery is not always safe. (Not to mention insanely expensive) There are many many cases of botched surgeries and I find it all really sad and slightly infuriating. 

This whole thread was about trends of the decade. Obviously plastic surgery was a thing before the fucking Kardashians. But they’re immensely popular and it’s obvious that they’ve influenced certain surgery trends. 

Not sure why you’re defending them tbh?"
AskReddit,f89ctv4,t1_f88dbu5,1574370933.0,Hasn’t that been going on since at least the 90s
AskReddit,f89c1o0,t1_f89amo5,1574370568.0,They have ridiculous amounts of money for doing nothing important and have influenced beauty standards to the point where it’s normalized extreme plastic surgery

TheRightCantMeme,f76z579,t3_dud3e5,1573439607.0,It’s extremely annoying when people take “Baby It’s Cold Outside” out of context. I’ve noticed it’s usually very young people who are outraged. So either roll your eyes and be silently smug about their stupidity or try to explain it. But those are really the only options.
SuicideWatch,f76sbnv,t1_f76rn3c,1573434484.0,"Yes exactly why I said if you’re paranoid throw it away or delete it! I’m in a place where if I had a physical journal, it would be found and there’d be trouble. So I keep notes on my phone because no one else ever is on my phone."
antiMLM,f76ayvq,t1_f74rh6j,1573425903.0,"Lol ew the only thing I can think is. If you ate a spoonful of olive oil before bed, you’re going to probably have to shit when you wake up. Maybe that’s what she’s doing lol 😂"
SuicideWatch,f76a4xm,t3_dudg6h,1573425632.0,"You might have heard this a million times before but it really helps to journal thoughts like that. If you feel like you need to get it off your chest. Tell it to the paper or type it in a note. I’ve even resorted to talking to myself in the shower lol anything to get the poison out. And it doesn’t make all the bad feelings go away and it doesn’t solve all your problems BUT it can help ease the urgency of the thoughts. Talking to people often can make things worse unfortunately I learned the hard way myself that you have to be very careful what you say even in therapy unless you want to get locked up in the psych ward. But in your journal you can say whatever you want to. And if you’re paranoid, read it after you’re done and then delete it or throw it away. But you still let it out and that’s what’s important."
SuicideWatch,f767qwf,t3_ducazz,1573424651.0,I think it’s possible to reach that in really deep meditation but since you’re human you can’t stay there forever. And there’s nothing that proves that is what happens when you die
SuicideWatch,f76754j,t1_f73t6w4,1573424258.0,Sorry you got downvoted for having feelings. People who don’t have serious internal problems don’t get it at all.
SuicideWatch,f766t2u,t3_du3rr1,1573424035.0,"Idk if I’ll get banned for this or whatever I’m even allowed to say. But this is why I stopped expecting people to help a long time ago. I stopped talking to people about feeling suicidal. I don’t think people actually care. They want to be able to say their words (as little as possible) and you to shut up and keep on moving on as if things are okay. As a bonus, they can pat themselves on the back and think they did something “good.” Normies don’t know how to deal with this kind of thing. Not even most therapists. 

It really seems like nobody cares until you’re actually gone. And then they wonder what they could have done? As if they would have. Maybe in hindsight. But you can’t go back in time so it’s pointless. 

Really makes me feel like I’m completely on my own."
Cringetopia,f5j68gq,t1_f5gmahb,1572221840.0,Lol at all the guys taking this as a personal attack because they can’t stand getting called out for being nasty.
SuicideWatch,f5eo5er,t1_f5en0w9,1572172993.0,"Lol why are you arguing with me about semantics. I literally said I was referring to the internet culture aspect. Seriously why are you arguing with me about this? I explained what I was talking about pretty thoroughly. I’m not trying to change a definition of a word. 

I was honestly trying to help you because you said your life has no meaning since you can’t connect with “females.” Most girls don’t like being called that. So not calling them that is a start....

Also the term incel started on the internet so I’m not even sure what you’re talking about"
SuicideWatch,f5emaer,t1_f5elokm,1572172424.0,I was referring to the internet culture. A lot of people who want to be having sex are not having sex but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re an “incel.” It’s the culture/attitude/mindset that’s ugly af
SuicideWatch,f5ejjt5,t1_f5ejd52,1572171433.0,"Yes. And if you don’t want to take it too seriously, it just sounds cringe and sometimes people associate it with incels. So it’s best to stop. Just say girls or women."
SuicideWatch,f5einxf,t3_dnomgg,1572171169.0,Everyone dies eventually
SuicideWatch,f5eihgp,t3_dniz8f,1572171084.0,"Idk how old you are but this is how I felt years ago and it just kept getting worse. Life is more disappointing every single day. The good moments turn out to be lies. Bad stuff happens that you never thought would happen to you because everything is already so shit. Gets worse and worse unless you’re able and motivated to put in a LOT of effort to turn your life around and it’s like ok but I’m mentally ill af, pills don’t work, therapy doesn’t work, self medicating distracts me but doesn’t actually help. And you just keep digging yourself a deeper and deeper hole until eventually you bury yourself alive. Mountains of debt, dirty dishes, laundry. Dead relationships, no friends, no goals, no hobbies. No nothing."
SuicideWatch,f5ehdyo,t1_f5eh84r,1572170715.0,"Trust me it’s pretty much all I do. Playing games, watching streamers, getting fat from junk food and reddit. I’m not even that good at video games lol"

SuicideWatch,f5egj86,t3_dnlepf,1572170328.0,"I always used to think that there was such a thing as a genuinely healthy relationship, but now I don’t think it’s very easy to achieve at all if it’s even possible. Not every relationship is abusive, but I think most are unhealthy at the very least. And usually not equal. And people are constantly cheating on each other. Makes you wonder what the point is."
SuicideWatch,f5eg8ao,t3_dniprx,1572170184.0,Stop calling them females
SuicideWatch,f5efx8c,t3_dnq3qg,1572170032.0,I’m 25 and the first time I tried to kill myself was when I was 8. I feel like this is just what my life has to be like. Either that or I was supposed to die a long time ago. I used to be angry but then I kind of just.... gave up. I have had therapists tell me that I can’t be cured and that I will have suicidal thoughts for the rest of my life. So wtf is the point of living tbh
JustNoSO,f49ncfa,t3_djx2as,1571475262.0,"This sounds way too eerily similar to the situation I’m in with my SO. I feel for you and it makes me really scared knowing I’m not alone in this type of experience. Sometimes I choose to be the silent doormat and sometimes I don’t, but I always regret when I speak up. Lately, since a recent incident, I’ve decided to just shut myself off and live in my own little world. I barely even look in my SO’s direction anymore. Just trying to work on myself and wondering if there is some sort of escape in the cards for me."
StardewValley,f47n50t,t1_f47n2if,1571424948.0,Thank you! I’ll have to keep a look out for that item in game.
StardewValley,f47i115,t3_djnmzj,1571422632.0,This might be a dumb question but how can you display items like that? (On the gray counter looking thing)
SuicideWatch,ewqs7on,t1_ewqpkq9,1565676767.0,"Maybe I do just need medication. I really don’t like taking pills because every time i have, they’ve actually made me feel worse or I’ve had terrible side effects that I couldn’t live with. But maybe it’s worth it. Maybe I’m as crazy as people say. 

I probably need a stronger dose."
SuicideWatch,evjk7je,t1_evjjl6d,1564564120.0,"The problem is, I’m worried I’m building my life around a lie. Everything I put time and energy into. All my time and energy into. Am I really making a positive impact? Or am I just being drained? I don’t know. I don’t know if I want to say too much. (And I’ll preface this by saying, breaking up wouldn’t be easy. It would be potentially too devastating because it would involve unearthing my entire life for the (I’ve lost count) hundredth time and I would also have to move thousands of miles away. I have no money and know no one wear I live but my SO)
My boyfriend has a lot of mental issues. As do I obviously. But his are anger related. Some days are amazing and I think we’ve worked through a lot of his issues. But most days it’s bad. I don’t expect him to be perfect all the time. Or ever. But sometimes he’s amazing and so loving and I believe making amazing progress and then other days... he hurts me. Not physically. But anyway. I’m not sure if I’m just being dramatic. If things aren’t that big a deal like he says. And I know a relationship isn’t a reason to kill yourself. I’ve been suicidal off and on (almost always on) since I was a child. And I’ve attempted before. But anyway. Sorry for the wall of text. I’m obviously in crazy mode at the moment"
SuicideWatch,evavr9l,t3_ciul8v,1564358589.0,"People just say what they think they’re supposed to say. I’ve always wondered if those who’ve begged me to stay alive actually give a fuck. I think it’s more like. They don’t want to deal with it. The guilt and the grief. It’s disruptive and upsetting to most people when someone dies. Especially a “loved” one. 

Human beings are selfish liars."
SuicideWatch,esk8crw,t1_esk5sz8,1562054973.0,"I have been on antipsychotics before as well as anti anxiety and anti depression and nothing really worked for me. To be fair I was abusing those drugs (snorting them) after a while. I was a mess. But I also hated the way meds made me feel. 

I do need to figure out how to meditate though. People tell me to meditate and I’m always in the dark as to how?"
