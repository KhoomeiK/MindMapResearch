BPD,fkhxqnn,t3_fcrfpo,1584207949.0,"My ex used my BPD to gaslight and justify his cheating. I became suspicious and communicated with him that I was, his response was that my BPD was flaring up and that I needed to return to therapy. So I did, because therapy is important regardless, but 3 months later I found out the person I was suspicious about had been sleeping with my ex and we ended up breaking up because I caught him attempting to cheat with another woman. 

It really messed with my ability to decipher between my rational and irrational thinking. I consider myself an intuitive person and it made me feel a lot of shame that instead of following my intuition, I was quick to backdown and blame my diagnosis myself. I’m still working on trusting myself and my feelings again, but I am somewhat happy to have had that experience because it opened my eyes to how gaslighting can often look caring and sweet, it isn’t always so obvious."
