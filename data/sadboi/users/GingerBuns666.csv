EatingDisorders,fndzprm,t3_g15kll,1586880478.0,"Hi, I'm sorry you are feeling this way. If I can offer a different perspective, maybe it might help... Usually when we are feeling out of control around food- or drawn to it like a magnet, it's because we are trying to control it too much. We are restricting foods and nutrients that our bodies need for fuel, like sugar and carbohydrates. Our bodies are hardwired to keep us alive at all costs, so we become clouded with food thoughts and obsessions. This leads to bingeing and grazing non-stop. Please consider the idea that there is no such thing as sugar or food addiction. You FEEL out of control around food because you restrict it. The more you restrict, the more your body craves it. When you give in, your brain floods your body with feel-good hormones as a reward for giving it fuel. It's a good idea to eat a variety of nourishing and nutritionally dense foods to let your body understand and trust that you won't deprive it of fuel. I promise your life, your body, your sleeping patterns, your outlook will change for the better. Please read ""The F It Diet"" by Caroline Dooner for more support with this. Give yourself grace. This is hard stuff. Best wishes."

Secondly, give yourself some grace. I am thinking that you may be in a restrictive mindset, therefore creating the guilt and shame you are feeling. The ""mental dieter"" within our minds is equally, if not more, harmful than our behaviors with food. It's ok to release the guilt and shame, drink a big glass of water, and take a deep breath. It's ok. Give yourself some grace. This is hard.  Remember to eat your next meal, and not skip it, or punish yourself. You got this."

EatingDisorders,f2fj2st,t1_f2fhdoe,1570218483.0,Edit*: Bingeing is NOT a willpower problem. It's a physiological response to food restriction. It's your body trying to keep you alive. Listen to her.
EatingDisorders,f2fhdoe,t3_dd5w3j,1570217843.0,"Hi, as someone who just graduated from an amazing program for Binge Eating Disorder, what truly stopped my binges were these two incredible changes:
1. Stop restricting food in all it's forms (i.e. keto, low carb, fasting, restricting after a binge, etc). Make peace with all foods. Including the forbidden ones.
2. Eat 4 meals a day including snacks. Trust me. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and a little more. In order to stop your brain from sounding the ""WE ARE STARVING"" alarms and pumping panic hormones throughout your body,  you have to consistently feed it. If you are currently bingeing on 1000's of calories in 1 sitting, you can eat 3+ meals a day with much less consequence. Think of it as eating more to eat less.
Trust me. As soon as your brain and body trusts that it won't be deprived again, the binges WILL stop. And you will FEEL it. The food obsession/fixations will STOP. You will feel clear headed and strong. 
Nourish and honor your body. ❤️"
