SuicideWatch,f4vos14,t3_dlyr5y,1571845617.0,"I've kept myself away from anyone (family/friends) for 5 years now. It's been easier for me to cope/live that way. Took me a long time to be cool with isolation though. It might work for you. I still have to work at fast food and retail jobs, but I don't go farther than co-worker with people."
schizophrenia,f4vkcul,t3_dlwh5f,1571843803.0,I've heard from a few people that it took them 10+ years to find the medication to managed their symptoms. It might take you awhile (years) to find the right one/s.
SuicideWatch,f4vjwxm,t3_dlt3od,1571843609.0,"I understand you.

I dropped out of college sophomore year because of pressure similar to what you're writing about (but I'm not gifted). I don't know what to do either. I'm 25 now. I go from job to job till I have a breakdown, or worse a psychosis episode, and then move onto the next. It feels to me that everyone is trapped as human capital. If we can't make as much money as possible then we are worthless. I'm not good at functioning that way. I hope you can find your way to live in this world without being constantly overwhelmed. 

You stay here with me, okay."
schizophrenia,f4usyuz,t3_dlwq9h,1571827679.0,"Hi. If you message me I'll answer. I'm not that good at talking, but I use Reddit frequently through out the day, so I'll reply at least daily. You can chat with me about whatever you like."

cycling,f4l7hmh,t3_dktob1,1571663390.0,"Riding a fixed gear is kinda like running on a treadmill, but the only way to slow it down is by resisting/pushing back on the pedal (or have a front break). I only recommend it if you're dead broke and need a bomb proof bike. Single speeds are still bomb proof, but don't require hours and hours of working on bike handling skills. It takes a long time to learn how to control speed on down hills, hop over curbs or obstacles, and find the gear ratio that work for both you and the environment you live in."
fixedgear,f16efbz,t3_d6cnan,1569209986.0,I really like the BonesSquad FG bikes from Canada. Give them a Google.

I'm sorry if I'm rude. That's not my intention. You are important. Mental health needs more compassion and understanding. I want him to be there for you. He has to put in the work to understand."
anhedonia,eysn6o6,t3_cyj9qk,1567404457.0,"I can relate. I don't care about friendships, having conversations, music, TV shows, news, video games. I don't have dreams or goals.

SuicideWatch,eyskfyq,t3_cyfpuu,1567401441.0,"The way I've always seen it is, how can people help if they haven't experienced it. I couldn't help someone who's suffered domestic abused, that's not my trauma. I can't relate other than the want to help and be there for them. I don't expect anyone to understand (what I deal with), let alone help, unless they've experienced what I have. I live in the USA. I feel like my culture needs to grow up to address suicide and other suffering. People around me also shut down and brush it off when I talk about suicide. So I stopped talking about it (to them)."
schizophrenia,eyhvkk0,t1_eyez5d8,1567093385.0,"It made me feel better after watching. I can't cope with my delusions and hilucinations now, but there's inspiration that one day I will be able."

I was surprised to learn that not understanding facial expressions, and never knowing conversationally what people want to hear, is common in scizophrenia. I don't feel like any ""type"" of person. I don't notice if I have a distinct personality. People have defined me as cartoon like before. I don't know if that's because I get word salad sometimes or that I have random out loud thoughts. I feel that I'll always just be a ""human"" who only wants food, shelter, and sleep. I've never been interested in any job or career."
SuicideWatch,exszw7p,t1_exsy832,1566560202.0,I forgot about how much money is made off of pills and therapy! It WOULD be out of interest for the health care business.
SuicideWatch,exsvgug,t3_cubgv9,1566557747.0,"I've wondered if it's because a lot of religions say suicide is taboo (sin)? Plus it's expensive to kill a person without pain.

And there seems (to me) to be some people who suffer from suicidal ideation, but don't suffer chronically? I guess maybe governments are trying to look out for the people that regret their attempt?"
SuicideWatch,exsrox9,t3_ctxp2a,1566554595.0,"That's terrible. I hate that. I hate when your looking for someone to just be understanding, but instead of respect for pain, they just say that it's my fault for not being able to sleep or handle going outside. The only people I've been able to have meaningful conversations about mental health are other people who have Scizophrenia/Anxiety Disorder/Anhedonia/Chronic Suicidal Ideation."

Hobbies, people, art, music, sex, food, sleep, new experiences, games. No matter what I do all of it feels like I'm staring back at a void. I know that there are things that I need to do, but I don't understand why. I used to be constantly drunk or high to feel, but after 6 years that's not effective anymore.
