Number two seems pretty straightforward, though the one thing I do always wonder about is if there's a number I can call or a website I can check to see if I have anything in collections or debts that I may have forgotten about or not known about. I remember one time when I was about 18-19 (22 now) I went to a doctor who claimed they accepted medicaid, then I received a bill in the mail for the visit saying the insurance rejected it. I don't remember which doctor or doctor's office it was since it was a few years ago, I merely remember this happening.

2.) I've royally fucked up my life. Go ahead and look at the first thing in my post history BESIDES the Dave ones for a small idea of what I mean... I've spent my whole life in incredibly psychologically abusive situations enduring a FUCKTON of complex trauma. I have CPTSD, disorganized attachment, major depression, the list goes on and on.

I hit the wall as a KID. A KID I tell you, and I am NOT exaggerating in the least. I'm a straight-up femcel.

I want to hit the point where I can financially AND mentally (like be mentally strong-willed enough) afford to do a complete 360 flip from worst health ever to best health ever. I wanna be a fitness junky and do everything OVER right just as much as I've done everything OVER wrong. I'm just terrified of all of the collateral damage because I see it in and on myself, I've ALWAYS seen it, and it's a scary thing to know about myself every day. I need to not only REVERSE it, but then ADD LOTS OF HEALTH ON TOP OF THAT. I'm TERRIFIED of dying early, so much so that when I've recently been looking into stock markets and finding into about Roth IRAs, it sends me into a bad panic because I'm terrified I won't make it to the age people are allowed to retire. I figure I have until 30, TOPS!!!"

Not sure if you edited this part in, or if my brain skipped a chunk, but I will confess that when I was 15 I had my only cooking experience ever where I brutally fucked up grilled cheese and quasidillas :( And those are supposed to be EASY!!! I'm still so embarrrassed about it to this day, and have never gotten over it, because it wasn't just one grilled cheese or quasidilla, I actually tried it a FUCKTON of times thinking that with experience and failures I would get better as any normal human with any level of self-esteem would do (which I didn't have a droplet of ironically), but no.

I'm just a complete void, void of any self trust or worth. Just stuck at hopelessness now, and detererorating more than I ever have in my life at a rapid pace, but this has been going on for a while now.

I was raised on fast foods and frozen dinners as well,  so I don't even have the ""being around a meal"" thing to influence me in any way, shape or form. I am a deeply uncultured swine. I genuinely don't know what a meal is.

I worry about undercooking things or forgetting a vital health step that is ""common sense"" to the whole dang world besides me, since my family isn't there in the head either and I ACTUALLY think they are autistic as well and just don't know it. The things out of their mouth and lack of common sense and less-than-preschool knowledge of EVERYTHING baffles me. And that's who I was raised by- which is, scary to say the very, very least. What if there are really important steps that everybody knows so a lot of cooking information will just skip it, for example washing the chicken. All I know is that EXISTS, but I don't even know the proper way to do it, if there's a right temperature of time increment, how to do it sanitarily like can you use your hands or a bowl or what can you put the raw dirty chicken in? Because I would think it's unsanitary to put it in the bowl, because wtf you're gonna use that the next time you cook! And I would think it's unsafe to use your hands because wtf what if you have cuts you don't realize you have, like little baby ones that don't bother you and go unnoticed? Do people have a dedicated dirty meat bowl or something??! I bring all this up to say, this is the ONLY example of what I'm asking that I can think of, and most cooking advice doesn't even mention washing the meat, so WHAT ELSE is supposed to be so common that I can EASILY have an ""idiot death/illness"" about?

I purchased blog hosting that's just been wasting away because 1.) With this chronic pain it's so hard to buckle down and SIT AND FOCUS enough to write for an actual project. With my personal stuff I can just ramble it and whoever doesn't like it won't answer, so dodged bullet. and 2.) I feel like #1 won't be worth the discipline if my fear comes true, and it is that I have a TERRIBLE fear of buckling down doing my writing for hopes of income later down the road, only for that to never come, something happens and it doesn't pay off, and I'm just stuck in this same shit house even more years down the road when I could have worked more corporate jobs that I sucked at, kept getting fired, but still had that money from me ""bullshitting"" my way through job after job after job... but I don't want to do THAT either because I don't WANT to IMAGINE where my confidence would be at after THAT!!!!!!!!

offmychest,fm5pwfv,t1_fm0pahh,1585777615.0,"I agree wholeheartedly, but it's not really about that. I know money can't buy happiness, but it can bring you way closer than you are, or to a place of acceptance. Money can (not buy specifically, but bring you damn sure close) stability (especially if you know how to handle that money, OR, if you don't, are at least smart enough to take that money to a financial advisor or personal accountant and have the will to LEARN. This is why it's important to be honest with yourself, because if you know that you don't know something, at least right then and there you won't have resistance to seeking out the tools to fix it out of pride. And yes I know, people have mixed feelings about personal accountants, I do agree somewhat but it's a STEPPING STONE). Aside from stability, money can't buy HAPPINESS outright, but it can help affording HIGH-QUALITY therapy (which is sooo expensive, even low quality therapy is expensive a lot of the time and is usually shit, I'm speaking from experience as a person who has PTSD from therapists alone. That's why moving forward I want to be extremely pick with who I see, and usually if somebody is good, they know their worth and therefore charge more. Yes, there are exceptions, but you have to care for yourself enough to not play guinea pig and gamble with something as vulnerable as your conscious. Are there expensive therapists who are crap? ABSOLUTELY, but at least put the odds in your favor). Aside from stability and happiness, money can fix a [plethora of things](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dc43in/are_you_worried_about_lifestyle_creep_as_you/) .  It's not about just chasing money and gucci bags. ARE there people like that?? FUCK YEAH. And I used to think that was all rich people were. In retrospect I see that that was a biased way of thinking. Rich people simply have a cup full enough to usually be able to deal with their hardships. ""Then why do you always see entitled rich people"" one may ask- Ahh, it's actually the entitled spoiled people. You see, I've noticed that the rich are likely to like that if they were BORN INTO it, or raised to not consider how their actions effect others. It's more of an issue of how one was raised, and money only amplifies it. I believe everybody is entitled to be the best version of themselves, though I know that may controversial."
