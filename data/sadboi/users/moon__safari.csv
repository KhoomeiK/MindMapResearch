depression,ey7cufj,t1_ey7cgig,1566878636.0,Thank you. I find this helpful. I like what you say about doing something easy so I know I will do it.
depression,ey7avix,t1_ey78dp9,1566876826.0,You should be proud of everything you've gone through. It must be hard but you are stronger than you think. I wish you can find that strength that is already inside of you.
depression,ey7a9if,t1_ey5pqml,1566876293.0,THIS is what i was feeling too.
socialanxiety,exv8sil,t1_exv2cff,1566594763.0,Thank you. I relate so much with the word vomit after being silent thinking about how I'm not normal. It's so hard to find a balance.
socialanxiety,ext9xr4,t1_exskyvb,1566565109.0,Thank you for answering. This was my first post ever on Reddit and reading to this makes me feel like I'm not alone in this.
socialanxiety,exs9vd4,t3_cu8ya4,1566537049.0,I'm in a similar situation. It makes me sad to think about who am i going to invite to my birthday party (it feels sadder not to do any party at all). I've been very insecure in my whole life and unable to make friends in high school. now in college i realise the value of friendship but i find it very hard to make any new friends. ive never been more lonely. i like to think that its better to have 0 friends than to have fake friends. i am hopeful that someday i will meet the right people and that might happen any day. im worried that my social anxiety might make this harder.
