bipolar,fownhzb,t3_g9qvwj,1588123294.0,"It's the tree bit that bothers me. Could just be mania. If the yelling is delusional then maybe psychosis? Also schizophrenia can have interesting effects. Not just bipolar would be my guess, but I'm not a crazyologist."
bipolar,fown8nm,t3_g9xumo,1588123143.0,"Q1 I got all 12, but they rarely came all at once, and intensity level matters. That said, I have had fun episodes in the past. The one I never did was spend money. When I was younger I earnt very little and couldn't get credit. Me and friends had a schedule of when wages/welfare came in and we effectively pooled our money so we could go on partying. 

I saw this quiz for the first time last month when I got re-diagnosed with a new shrink. It helped to complete it."
bipolar,fowmldf,t3_g9wzb4,1588122765.0,"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU YAWNING SO FUCKING MUCH!

Yeah, the stupidest things. Morons in traffic, not ever having the right pair of shoes, the way they stacked the fruit in the supermarket so all the ones I want are at the bottom, the sky being just slightly the wrong shade of blue. All these petty things and million more, getting more petty all the time,

Drugs help. Lithium has chilled me the fuck out, and if that doesn't work I have a back up remedy of a Manhattan."
bipolar,fosbiuk,t3_g96apl,1588027495.0,"I haven't been in that head space for a while, except for the time I got high a few years ago and sincerely believed I had permanently broken. I do fear it will happen though, my hallucinations are returning, and I had some delusions yesterday. Today I don't know what they are, and it makes me feel like there are two me's. One is the executive function (hi!), and the other is the slowly degenerating degenerate.

Fun times."
bipolar,fosattm,t1_forpf6p,1588027123.0,"It is an act of great bravery to go online and talk about weird sexual urges. I think that medication would be a great idea to see if they go, or you need other help with your life. Being brave over again is something we often have to do, so I'm certain you can do this."
bipolar,forz9r1,t1_foq82r3,1588021121.0,Same same. And we all have the best stories because hypomania. Damn.
bipolar,fohc25o,t3_g7g5pm,1587763457.0,"A few years ago some arsehole was annoying me and a friend and I said ""The sad thing is, he's the hero of his own story. He's too much of an arsehole to know he's an arsehole. I wonder how that feels?"" That was the day I realised I'm an arsehole.

I decided that there was no point relitigating all the arseholish things I've done in the past, and decided to try and change. Ultimately I ended up in therapy, then a psychiatrist's office, then at the counter at CVS collecting my meds.

We are what we are. Self awareness, meds, and the ability to pause before reacting have brought me a long way."
bipolar,fogh4gv,t3_g71ub4,1587752508.0,"The weird thing that I had when diagnosed was that some friends couldn't accept it at all (and still don't) and other, older friends basically said ""Duh! You only just figured it out?"" My family mostly accepted it, especially as the stuff I learned help confirm that my dad is also bipolar. We all knew that. He won't seek treatment."
bipolar,fogcg9z,t3_g6x46f,1587750796.0,"No, but I do see friends having older friendships than me. My interrupted ones (reasons, moving) don't seem to have the depth."
bipolar,fogal01,t3_g5suab,1587750114.0,This is amazing. Would you sell the original?
