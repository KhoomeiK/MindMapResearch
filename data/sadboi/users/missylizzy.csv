Less go into nature. Most hate their jobs. There are more drug addicts than ever. The environment is being slowly destroyed.

I can keep going. Sure, maybe people feel more secure, but is anyone really happier? More content?

Families are more broken than ever. Most kids are raised by 1 parent or neglected.

They end goal is that Satan wants to be worshipped like God. He will likely manifest some type of AI to gain the worship of many. He works through those at the top (and really he does anything to bring people down and away from Jesus).

Think I'm crazy? The Bible predicts there will be a ""mark"" that we all get - that we cannot buy or sell unless we have it. It will be inserted into our bodies.

Women and men dressed more conservatively. It meant that it was probably easier to keep your eyes on your partner. Now everywhere you look...naked people everywhere. On billboards, in movies, etc.

I feel like there used to be more respect in marriage. Cheating and divorce were big deals, and though they happened, there was much more social shame.

Men who used to pick up porn were considered the town perverts. Sure, it existed, but it was nothing like it is today.

Having a baby was considered a good, wonderous thing - not something that inhibited your life.

Women wore makeup, yes, but did not contour their entire faces and photoshop their bodies. There was a natural beauty standard that was more achievable.

Men were supposed to lead the household and treat their wives with dignity. Sex was not only see as a lustful action, but an important duty in marriage.

Family was important. Family was honored. 

Times have changed, and I want to note here that I am a former, atheist, liberal, feminist. I also got divorced previously. 

It was terrible. I wish I had known what I know before I entered that marriage.

I now see love, sex, and society so differently. I dress more conservatively (but still beautifully). I am thankful I am with a man who does not watch porn. I am seeing what the Bible says is TRUE.

Women - get off the damn social media sometimes! I cheated easily on my ex though these means. The OP is right. We demand and crave attention. Find the one man you only want attention from. (PS my ex cheated on me as well...our divorce was mutual).

DebateReligion,fqfjtda,t1_fqfiqh1,1589326180.0,"He makes them male of female. That is my answer. Like I'm not sure what you want me to say? It goes beyond just anatomy.

Edit: Male and female go beyond anatomy to God. 

Could you clarify your question if I'm really not understanding."
DebateReligion,fqfi7ja,t1_fqff0v4,1589325347.0,"1. We were created male and female by divine design.

According to the Genesis creation account, God created humanity male and female ([Gen 1:26–28](https://www.esv.org/Gen%201%3A26%E2%80%9328/)). Maleness and femaleness are creational, not contractual. They are divinely instituted rather than socially defined. Thus our gender identity cannot simply be renegotiated the way in which we refinance a mortgage or reschedule an appointment. God created us, and we are his creatures, both men and women."
DebateReligion,fqfemhc,t1_fqfdtja,1589323528.0,"No I do not think God's view on gender is entirely based on anatomy and physiology alone. God set guidelines for male and female and roles to go along with them.

Because we live in a fallen world, it is easy to fall from his standards. 200 years ago, sex and gender norms aligned more with Biblical teachings. Today, they seem to be straying further and further away.

Does that mean that people who are transgender will burn in hell? No. We all sin.

God looks at our heart, like you said. If we accept Jesus and work to repent and fix our sins, God will have mercy on us."
DebateReligion,fqfb487,t1_fqf9z3x,1589321776.0,"The roles are defined physically, spiritually, and psychologically. I could try to find a verse for each?


Physically - women are generally going to give birth (not always) and be supportive in maternal ways. Men lead and do more physical labor/work.

Mentally - God talks about how women should act and express themselves (more humility, gentleness, etc). Men generally are leaders.

Spiritually - God distinguishes between the role or women and men in the church."
DebateReligion,fqf9l4s,t3_gil5gq,1589321016.0,"The Bible has a few verses about not wearing clothes of the opposite sex, which could be a reference to transgenderism.

With that being said, I think God was very clear about standards for men and women in the Bible. On some level, transgenderism can go against that.

If God set standards for how men and women should ""be"", then transgenderism would go against those.

I'm not saying that a person should have hate for a transgender person or anything like that. I believe gender dysphoria is very real. However, I'm not sure ""transitioning"" is the only solution to dysphoria.

Before I get attacked, there are many people who have detransitioned who realize that was not the best answer for them.

So does the Bible blatantly speak out against transgender people? Not really. Should we hate on transgender people? No. Could defying gender roles be disrespectful to God? Possibly.

Just some thoughts."
