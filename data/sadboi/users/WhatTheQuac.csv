Yes and No. U learn extremes. 
The most commen one is, understanding how depression changes people and acting and they become someone else 

 Other one is I had, some other people with depression I k ow had similar things. U start looking different at things. Sometimes u can see things way more realistic and sometimes u see things so different through ur depression/anxiety bubble that after u get out u have a different view. 

Example: how I think about peoples acting towards me. I allways knew some people act different than they ""actually"" would, but never understood why I trigger so different reactions towards me. And facing this, experiencing and reflecting my acting towards other people (depending on my mood) help me ""grow"" a bigger understanding.

BUT I don't think u need actually depression for this. Some/many people maybe need extremes to change/realizing stuff but I think theoretical u can without."
