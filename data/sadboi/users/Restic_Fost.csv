(Only a side note, I have never possibly suffered from something like this, but when there's too much on my mind or I get seriously stressed I just put my headphones on and go outside where there are no people around, sometimes I cry, sometimes I run and sometimes I just walk and look around me to distract myself. Or my friend just goes deep deep into the forest and screams at the top of his lungs. I know you didn't ask for this, but as a stranger on the internet I just want to help you, even though it may not be useful, take care and write here anytime you feel worse or better, that's what this Reddit is for :) )"

I might understand, because my mother is the same and the difference is that I cannot leave.
The only thing I can think of at the spot is having a pet or something like that, to help you with the feelings.
I'm sorry if I didn't help you.
