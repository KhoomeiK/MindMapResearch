Psychosis,fokwcmu,t1_fokvcnf,1587850198.0,"1.	‚Å†The "" whole narrative of victimization"" you speak about - does this mean somewhere deep deep down in his brain does realise the CIA story he's telling himself isnt true? and he knows he's inflicting this victim narrative onto himself?

I can‚Äôt know for certain that he truly believes in the story or if he is making it up. A part of me thinks he knows he is delusional but the other part thinks he truly believes in the story. We can‚Äôt be certain. For me, when I do drugs it‚Äôs hard to tell whether I am vicitimizing myself or not, like, when I am in a drug induced psychosis and believe that I am God, I truly believe in it, but after the drugs wear off, and am back on meds, I can tell that it was the drugs and that I am no God, I am a human being. Does that does not makes any sense?

2. Disorders usually steam from an emotion. e.g Bulimia is self-hatred. Anger is powerlessness .. What emotion would you say is the root cause of psychosis/delusions/hallucinations ? Would it be the feeling of feeling unloved? rejection? anger? abandonment? loneliness?   (Whene I got servery depressed years ago I worked out my deep rooted emotion was powerlessness over the situation and not being able to fix or have things in my life the way I wanted them)

It‚Äôs different for everyone. I was friends with a girl who believed that the radio listened to her. It is a pattern for people like us to be living with their parents, no job, no income, just kind of sitting ducks. So he might actually feel like a sitting duck! For the government. So it‚Äôs definitely a trend, that they have no security (refer to Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs‚Äù a roof over their head, when they do, and could be delusional when actually they have no security in themselves? I support going to the hospital, That will help him stabilize and maybe he can find housing outside of his parents house to stop the trend."
Psychosis,fokt8au,t3_g801bd,1587848500.0,"1. Psychosis can be caused by a number of things. Drugs, lack of sleep, stressful situations. If he‚Äôs not sleeping right now it could be because of that. People with psychosis need a regular sleeping schedule. If it‚Äôs out of whack, the system is out of whack and boom, psychosis. 
2. The ability to ‚Äúflip‚Äù is very common. When I am in psychosis, or have episodes of psychosis, It‚Äôs hard to think rationally, I was called a flip flop from being intensely psychotic, one moment, then normal the next, when this happens I usually have a greater influence on my body system, or my mind, and I don‚Äôt snap out of it, I just feel sorry for myself and stop with the whole narrative of victimization. Does that make any sense? 
3. Psychologically his brain is quite frankly playing tricks on him. You don‚Äôt have to play along with his story. The best bet would be if he went to an emergency mental health  clinic (not a hospital) and got a shot of antipsychotics.
4. The only way to tell if he is suicidal is by asking him. If he says no, he isn‚Äôt. He is just in a major psychotic episode and either a. Needs to see an emergency
Psychiatric doctor/psychiatrist and get meds ASAP, or B. Get checked into a psych ward."

Psychosis,flufwzp,t3_fr6t5j,1585501803.0,"Hi. I got my first job at 23 years old. I worked at a home furnishings store and quickly got the job. I barely worked three months before I slipped and couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. It was An amazing job. I have so much regret from it. But that‚Äôs just it. This mental illness is what it is, a mental illness, we can‚Äôt function the same pace as cognitive normals. They are used to getting up and working everyday. I have a job but history repeated and I couldn‚Äôt finish one of my shifts. I slipped and drank alcohol the same day as my shift and couldn‚Äôt finish it. I just walked out. They haven‚Äôt called me back. I‚Äôm putting in my two weeks April first. I have strong impulsivity, social anxiety, crippling low self esteem, and delusions; always looking over my shoulder. Since I have started doing spirituality and the whole Christianity thing, it has helped me become less anxious, and have faith in something higher than myself. But I still need that push from somebody to tell me to get work, to have a miracle happen to me to find work, etc, because if I do it all myself It just doesn‚Äôt happen for me. Getting a job, for me, requires luck and due diligence. I have to find a job ASAP and will apply today. So to answer your question, I kinda have a job, I‚Äôm starting to look for another one. It‚Äôs hard because of this diagnosis to keep one. So don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself bud, you are a hard worker and we can all see you are trying."

loseit,flqobte,t3_fq62x2,1585401762.0,"I used to be skinny. Only 7 years ago I was in perfect shape. I remember my first time I developed a binge eating disorder and ditched my healthy lifestyle all together. I was going through a lot back then. And so I just started eating junk food. The weight crept on year after year, averaging 20lbs per year. In only 7 years I had gained 133 lbs. I have been trying to lose weight for all those years. My family encourages me to lose weight too. They comment on my eating but nowadays I just say fuck if and eat what I want. It‚Äôs horrible. I have no self discipline, which is why I joined r/selfdiscipline, and r/IntermittentFasting. The moment where I decide to lose weight for good is here but circumstances have made it hard for me to. I don‚Äôt think I will ever lose the weight I gained. I might, but it will take time. And being this overweight, I have no time. I think the answer to your question is what mostly the top commenter described, that if ultimately falls upon ones individual responsibility to lose weight. Also society gives a lot of the expectations that ones weight is purely out of self control, when it really is a societal problem itself. The obsession over thigh gaps and collar bones and such. It‚Äôs such a failure to be fat. Which is quite sad because I believe fat is beautiful. However there is truth in society‚Äôs expectation, I believe, because I got fat on my own accord. But when my parents pester me and call me a pig for being fat, I blame myself and not them. Sad but true. It‚Äôs all on me."

For me, I get delusional and angry when I am in psychosis. I told my mom off today. I shouldn‚Äôt have. I shouldn‚Äôt have fought with her and be the bigger person but because I drank alcohol today, which triggers my psychosis which I shouldn‚Äôt have done, well there if goes. Uncontrollable rage. A sense of self urgency that if you don‚Äôt get the thing, you must fight. I am a very brave person and grateful for my freedom living in this country. So if someone steps on my heels I fight. But because of this mental illness I fight when it‚Äôs unnecessary, the whole world isn‚Äôt out to get me, I just need to sit down. And breathe and just tell myself to not fight, that I should back down. To just coddle myself. To not take it so seriously . Must I have gratitude!!! Yes I must!!! I love my mom.

I‚Äôm not a doctor, but I also take medicines that make me drowsy, they mostly make me want to eat and sleep all day as well. But, there are things that have to be done. Maybe you can try making homework as a top priority, and leave notes motivating you to do your homework everywhere, to remind yourself."

intermittentfasting,fjfjfve,t3_fd5lif,1583293035.0,I need to do this like asap. I am so heavy it‚Äôs so not fun. Being fat and unhappy is so not fun. I‚Äôm tired of my depression and of being booed at by society. I‚Äôm tired of not being heard. I need to do intermittent fasting but nothing. I just need to do this
schizoaffective,fjfamm9,t3_fcqe0d,1583287823.0,"Whenever I‚Äôm watching the news, any type of news, if something tragic happens I think it‚Äôs because of me. I think the world revolves around me. Sometimes I think that my choices have a butterfly affect and affect everything around me. It‚Äôs the scariest thing ever. But not everything is in my power. I must accept the things I can‚Äôt control. But that‚Äôs the thing with this disorder is that it‚Äôs scary to believe the News or anything is specifically caused by you. I think about my higher power whenever I go through something like this. I can attribute it also to my upbringing and how my actions would directly affect my family."

You‚Äôll remember why you are leaving and reminding yourself that you don‚Äôt want to smoke. I like to keep sticky notes on my bathroom mirror or a flash card in my pocket listing out reasons to quit for example.

Edit: health is wealth. If health reasons are your go to for quitting then put your health first and not the Jane. God bless"
