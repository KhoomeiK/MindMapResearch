To the normal people: the female responses to this comment are immature and weird. How can someone have sexual desires at 11?! Back then I was still shocked about what sex is. Kissing on the mouth was disgusting. It’s how kids think. 


And yes sexual experience has a lot with an increased desire in women. It’s a fact, do your research. Just remember that Pringles motto and you’ll know what I’m talking about ;)
