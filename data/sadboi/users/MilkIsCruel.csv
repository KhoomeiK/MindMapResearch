It's so baffling, because as the guy says in the video, now there's no definitive version anymore. If you want cel shading you have to play in 480p, if you want 1080p you get the weird realistic shading of the remake and if you play on an emulator you don't get the other improvements like with the improved hookshoy the remake added to the game."

Finding the shrines was always more fun than actually solving them. Plus the damn wait times every time you go down to a dungeon...

These people are legally obligated to inform the authorities and can be held accountable if you end up hurting yourself and someone finds out they knew about it. Be very careful what you talk to professionals about. There's exceptions but as a rule watch what you're saying. If you have free healthcare at least your stay will be paid for, but you might still lose your job, be unable to pay your rent and be left worse off after you get out than before. If you're in the US you'll even be charged for your stay and ambulance, so be fucking careful. You'll most likely be diagnosed with some mental illness within 24h and put on medication immediately, so big pharma can make some money. The same drug companies that have been caught multiple times bribing doctors to overprescribe their medication. If you refuse medication you will be labeled uncooperative and might be held there even longer and against your will, at least as long as they can make money off you in some way.

NintendoSwitch,fpnmuyn,t3_geh0s0,1588767720.0,"Mario Odyssey will last you a long time, there's like 700 moons or so to collect. Biggest Mario yet.

Doom 2016 is very very fun. If you like original 2 Doom games you can't go wrong here, it's very fast paced and the Switch version runs surprisingly well. 

Super Metroid is my biggest recommendation and it comes free with Nintendo Switch Online as part of the SNES classics app. It's one of the greatest games of all time and perfected the formula so many games borrow from nowadays. Beautiful visuals and sound design plus were getting a new Metroid Prime on the Switch at some point (probably 2022 or maybe 23) so now is the perfect time to get into Metroid if you haven't already.

If you enjoy 2D Zelda's I seriously recommend Links Awakening. While not a perfect remake the original game is still the best 2D Zelda imo with a very memorable world and characters. I wouldn't pay more than $40 for it though. Maybe get it used and sell it when you're done. Definitely not worth the $60 compared to games like Odyssey and Smash Bros. Thinking about it it might make more sense financially to first play Zelda: A Link to the Past on Nintendo Switch Online first, as it's free and many people prefer it over Link's Awakening.

Monster Hunter is a game where you basically only fight bosses (mostly dragon looking monsters which you fight for around 15 minutes) and loot their corpses for materials which you turn into armor. Attacking and destroying certain body parts (like their tail or horns) gives you extra materials you'll need for certain recipes. It also has an online component and heading out to fight a hard monster with other players is tons of fun. You'll easily sink 200h into this game.

Dark Souls is notoriously hard but very rewarding. You get the hang of it. You explore a vast interconnected fantasy world and you're always on the edge of your seat because you never know what you'll find around the next corner. The combat is comparable to Monster Hunter and BotW. Don't be frustrated if you die like 20 times to a certain boss. The games about learning move patterns and a single mistake can cost you the fight.

There's also Mario World and Yoshi's Island on Nintendo Switch online which are all time classics as well."

You can get a new ""screen"" (the actual LCD panel is not removed during this repair) costs about 10 bucks on Amazon under the name ""digitizer"". The repair itself is kinda finicky though, so it's not something I recommend you do unless you're very sure you know what you're doing. If you take too long replacing the digitizer when the old one is removed you risk getting dust particles between the screen and digitizer, which will be just as annoying as scratches.


Edit: apparently you don't have Amazon in your country. You could do eBay though, right? Or maybe check if there's phone repair shops in your city, they might know how to get a replacement and do the repair for you. Otherwise I guess you could maybe get Nintendo to replace it at a cost.
Or you sell your Switch and get a new one. If you sell high and try to get a good deal you might not lose too much money this way.

I relieved myself and upon flushing noticed that the damn toilet got clogged from the massive shit I just took. I turned the whole bathroom upside down looking for a plunger which was no where to be found. Mind you, people were already lining up at the bathroom door, as I was already in there for a least 5 minutes.I had to hurry. So I did the only rational thing one could do in such a predicament: I reached down into the water, pulled that 10 inch turd out and wrapped it in TP. Now I just needed to get rid of it without anyone noticing. I thought about wrapping it in plastic and smuggling it out, but I couldn't find a proper bag anywhere. There was however this small window facing the apartment's inner courtyard (this was maybe the 4th floor or so). So I cracked the window open and just placed the paper-wrapped-turd on the outer windowsill, hoping that no-one would find it before we moved back out in a few days.
We never got a negative review or anything. Maybe it's still sitting there."
