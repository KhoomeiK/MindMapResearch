I was talking to him, having a completely mundane conversation, before he got super upset. He was like, BAWLING, which I never saw him do in real life, absolutely freaking out and asking me how and why I was there. I didn't know he was dead while I was dreaming so I was baffled and I had no idea why he was upset until I woke up. It was like I went to visit him and neither of us knew what was going on lol"

So many people have left really helpful comments so I'll leave it brief but I'm sorry you didn't get the support you were looking for - no one knows your experiences better than you do and no one has the right to a medical opinion except your doctor.
I can't relate myself but one of my best friends has been dealing with seizures (she also doesn't have epilepsy for the record) and I know she finds them absolutely terrifying. I'm glad your last experience posting didn't stop you reaching out here :)"

ptsd,fou359i,t1_fotnvhk,1588074859.0,"It's really difficult to say whether they'll come back or not, some people eventually remember everything but some never do - either way, it doesn't make the experience any less real or valid :)

Basically, when something is happening right now it's in your short term memory, and when something has happened in the past, even if it's only 30 seconds ago, it's in your long term memory. If something really upsetting happens and causes trauma, it doesn't get filed in the long term memory properly because your brain can't process it all at once - this is why you don't remember, but would also explain any flashbacks or panic symptoms. If something triggers that unprocessed memory, your brain is like ""oh right, I need to deal with that!"", and then you get those unpleasant symptoms.

The first time it was explained to me, I was told to think of long term memory like a well organised wardrobe and trauma memories like a big heavy blanket covered in thorns. It hurts to deal with it and it's hard to fold, so you just shove it in the wardrobe and try to forget about it, but sometimes it spills over and you have to face it again. (There's a positive ending though - professional help and a good support network help you pull out the thorns and fold it all up neatly!)

I'm not a professional, but to me it sounds like what you were trying to do pulled up a part of your trauma memories which may not be processed yet, so because your brain was trying to immediately process them, you felt like they were happening right now. That would explain why you reacted as if it was happening now, and why you've forgotten that period of time.

Does that all make sense? I'm a psych/neuro postgrad so I can answer your questions about the brain, but I can't really offer an explanation for how it relates to you I'm afraid - that's always best left to professionals :)

OSDD,fou0px2,t1_fosi9ek,1588072746.0,"I think they have rules on askdid about not validating or diagnosing, so asking if something is normal is against the guidelines. It makes sense, because dissociative disorders can vary so much between people that it's not fair to tell other people what's normal. Even though I was posting because I wanted to see if my experiences were similar, I didn't ask anybody to validate them, I just asked other people for their experiences so I could decide for myself :)"

There's definitely a lot more that I haven't got back yet but I don't know if I even want it hahaha

I do have one thing I can't explain where every now and then I have flashbacks to random images from my childhood, like a certain toy or my old garden, which I NEVER remembered until I saw them all at once and had a panic attack. That happened once, I forgot everything again, and then it happened again. Since the second time I think I've remembered everything I saw and it still gives me an icky feeling.

ptsd,forff3p,t3_g8zqon,1588011308.0,"Trauma is subjective - what's traumatising for you might not be traumatising for someone else, so the only person who really gets to say whether that was traumatising for you, is you. It's certainly possible that you have PTSD from that episode, but it's also possible you have PTSD from your entire school experience. If whatever you were going through in school made you feel that anxious and depressed then it's enough to traumatise you, but yes, a suicidal episode can definitely be traumatising on it's own.
I'm sure you know this already but it would definitely be helpful to talk it out in therapy :)"
OSDD,foo4jiu,t1_foo3dyw,1587932358.0,"Yes! Well, no matter how it's labelled and how others perceive it, what you experience is always valid. You may later come to understand it as OSDD, DID or something else entirely, but what you feel and what you go through is always real and valid.

I came across a lot of videos from other people, I think multiplicity and me and maybe the entropy system, where they explain that alters can seem very similar to the host because their whole job is helping you survive, so they have to blend in. Finding out you have them is a whole lot to take in also, so they not only hide from the public but from you too. Don't quote me on this but there's a figure that I think is only 6% of DID cases are super obvious - if you manage to find the videos I saw you'll see that statistic and the right citation! So, being early stages, I don't think that not being super obvious makes them less valid."

It started off as Lily but I think we're heading towards Lia now.

I was just the same in school!! I just think/thought I thrived in certain environments and not others, like I would be super quiet in one class then go across the hall and be the life of the party, but I just thought I must be more comfortable with the class or something.

It usually feels like I'm arguing with my anxious brain in these scenarios, like they're talking to each other, or more like my chill brain is trying to firmly calm my anxious brain down while my anxious brain yells about having bad ideas. So yeah, it kind of feels like having a conversation with words, and my anxious brain sort of responds but it's not super co-operative, it just keeps yelling until it's distracted or whatevers stressing me out is gone."
