For heterosexual men many young women would look much better than a young man at the same age, so when a pretty woman age the contrast would look bigger than if a not so pretty man ages. It doesn't mean men ages better than women, but that in heterosexual men's eyes it appears that way because of the contrast. You will notice much easier if something beautiful appears less beautiful to you than if something that looks neutral stays neutral.

I think it's individual how good or bad someone ages, and that less contrast doesn't necessarily make the aging better. If a dark blue and a white t-shirt gets stained, they're both equally stained. Just because of it's more visible on the white one, it doesn't mean the blue one is much better. It's still there and you can still feel it although you may not ""see"" it.

It only counts if it's super obviously. If the character just looks like a normal person and you won't notice it's from a horror movie immediately, then it doesn't count. A person who've never watched a horror movie should be able to tell it's horror related.

If Brad Pitt choose to play in a horror movie and his character looks like him, it may not be super obviously people looking like Brad Pitt are horror related if you've not watched the movie. Brad Pitt may have also played in multiple none horror related movies. 

IT however is super obviously. The twins in the Shinings are only obviously if they wears the correct outfits and walks two-and-two."

Hvis du liker blondiner eller rødhårede er det naturlig å foretrekke nordiske mer enn spanske.

Liker godt nordiske jenter, men mange ser bare bra ut mellom 18 og 35. Mange legger lett på seg, er høye, blir lett kraftige og rynkete - spesielt med alderen. Men når de er unge og slanke kan de se fine ut.

Det går ofte nedover etter midt i 30-årene eller 40-årsalderen for kvinner, mens det er nærmere 50 for menn på grunn av kontrasten."

For meg er ikke forfallet størst problem i dating, men heller hvordan vi ville sett ut i lag. Jeg er lav, ser yngre ut enn det jeg er og er liten, så å finne kvinne på min størrelse og som ser like gammel ut som meg er vanskelig. Jeg synes allikevel det er lettere å finne pene kvinner blant de unge enn blant menn.

De peneste mennene befinner seg i Spania og lignende land synes jeg, mens kvinner i Korea og lignende. 

Norge har flere pene kvinner enn menn, men større kontrast på aldring enn enkelte andre land også. Russland har enda større kontrast enn Norge synes jeg."
norge,fqem37o,t1_fqeilv1,1589309815.0,"Jeg er en bifil kvinne og har lagt merke til dette. Hovedgrunnen til at jeg synes det føles slik ut er kontrast. Kontrasten er mye større på kvinner enn menn siden de ofte er penere. Er man pen, kan man bare bli mindre pen. Er man midt på treet kan man nesten bare bli penere.

Menn slipper ikke helt unna. Noen får ølmage, måne, rynker, grått hår og gammel mannslukt. Men det er individuelt. Noen kvinner kan få rynker, grått hår, legge på seg og få en mer maskulin stemme, ansikt og lukt etter overgangsalderen.

Mange menn er som stein og kvinner som blomster. En aldrende blomst er tydeligere enn en aldrende stein, men en ung blomst er kjent for sin skjønnhet og steinen for sin ungdommelighet."
norge,fqef7k7,t1_fqe510y,1589306552.0,"Min teori er at menn kommer senere i puberteten og derfor vil de se yngre ut i tenårene og tidlig 20-årene. Det vil påvirke resten av utviklingen også. En 15 år gammel gutt vil se litt yngre ut enn en 15 år jente.

En annen grunn kan være kontrasten. I mange heterofile menns øyner er kvinner gjerne pene når de er ung, så kontrasten blir veldig stor når de blir eldre som dag og natt. Menn i menns øyner ser sånn passe ut, med andre ord vanligvis ikke spesielt vakker, så overgangen og kontrasten blir mindre slik som kveld og natt. Er man pen har man masse å tape og er man midt på treet er det vanskelig å bli verre, så det vil ofte være likt eller bli bedre.

Dessuten har eldre menn lært å kle seg bedre enn yngre på grunn av jobbens forventninger. Man er gjerne forventet å gå i dress eller business casual i stedet for tenåringsstilen sin. Menn kan kanskje lære seg å bli mer sjarmerende hvis de ønsker å bli ledere, få mer personlighet, erfaring og status med tiden som mange kvinner liker.

Kvinner liker gjerne andre ting enn menn som også kan forklare hvorfor man oppfatter eldre kvinner annerledes enn menn."

I don't start to think people can start to be cute before late teen or adulthood. I do for example think Emma Watson and Keira Knightley are both cute and pretty. To me cuteness and beauty goes often hand in hand. I think some animals and stuffed animals can have a cute appearance too, but in a different way.
