You need to talk to your husband about the efficacy of his decision and if his reasoning is sound and then consider it as a family, the son included. If he’s making this decision on superficial reasoning that falls apart when you refute his point of view then you need to veto it. Hopefully he’s a man of reasoning and logic and will understand the leverage you hold in this decision when he realizes how wrong and destructive his idea was. If he still doesn’t budge then you HAVE TO stand up for you and your son and make it clear that he is not leaving and that your husbands decision no longer has merit in this argument. 

Side note: do not let him being the provider of the family (if he is that) be a form of leverage as to why  
his decision holds precedence in the household, this is a family matter, not a financial one. I’ve read too many stories where the father makes decisions like a dictator because he brings in the money and all it’s ever lead to was discord and distraction.

AskMen,fnpp5wk,t3_g31boh,1587149453.0,"Here’s my take on it:


On social media I don’t see pictures of women, even with cake face, as a representation of how they’d look irl. On social media I feel like the whole point is to look more extra and attention grabbing, which cake face does a pretty good job at, while subtle modifications to ones appearance just makes the individual look more normal and thus doesn’t make them stand out as much. If I were to scroll through my feed and see a girl with a moderate amount of makeup I could easily scroll past it, subconsciously thinking it’s just another girl that Ik irl that I follow and don’t really interact with, however if a girl had a lot of makeup on it’d prob grab my attention cause I’d be like “woah, holdup what’d I just scroll past”. Of course this doesn’t necessarily mean I’d like the post, I’m not attracted to heavy makeup and it’s honestly off putting for me, However someone else that doesn’t mind that/likes the post for the message attached to the post would give it a like.  

However if I saw the girl irl, since I don’t like heavy makeup, I definitely wouldn’t bother trying anything with her because to me I don’t like the idea of my girlfriend having two faces that are subjectively very different from the other. I understand a little makeup to enunciate the good qualities and suppress the undesirable ones, but when it gets to the point where they wear enough to the point it alters their appearance significantly it just feels like I’m buying a McDonald’s burger expecting to get the version I see in the comercial only to receive the flat and sad looking burger that reality would serve you. 


TL;DR on social media I feel the use of makeup is more for attention grabbing and also has no real bearing on the amount of makeup they’d use irl, but irl excessive makeup just feels like false advertising"

He needs to learn some respect and understand that if you’re gonna be a shitty person you deserve to be treated like feces. I hope the best for you and wish you all the best the police and other governmental agencies can offer you. We can only hope your step dad understands his wrong doings and figures out how much hurt he’s actually brought on to other people. 

if he doesn’t please do not rationalize this situation as something that happened because of the stresses of quarantine, everyone is in the same boat and if he isn’t capable of interacting with other human beings in a time where everyone is stressed then he needs to seek out his own means of shelter. 

His comment on how he’s the provider of the family also concerns me because that is not justification for acting like an authoritarian dictator, and commanding others to act and speak how he sees fit. He chose to be the provider and could just have easily found another household where both parents were providers for their kids. 

I’m not trying to sound like a parental figure with this paragraph, however I think you should to talk to your mom, she shouldn’t side with your step dad just because their married.

I can’t remember where I heard/read this (it could have been an hour long Ted talk on psychedelics) but people place the birth of their child as one of the most profound experiences they have, and they would never think that anything could top the feelings obtained in that moment, nothing could be more profound. Now I’m not saying tripping on a shit ton of LSD and DMT would top something like child birth however they’re significant in their own independent regards. 

Taking your first tab or first hit of DMT is crazy, you wouldn’t have ever thought that your brain was capable of such perception and cognition, even those stories you here from your friends or online couldn’t truly convey the experience of what having a psychedelic trip is like and thus you add a whole new aspect to your reality. There’s a good chance DMT is a kids toy compared to some other psychedelics we could find, after all the only information we’ve been able to gather is from indigenous tribes and their experience and history with drugs as well as common people giving their anecdotal experiences with the recreational and therapeutic use. We’ve been so restricted when it comes to exploring the world of entheogens and psychedelics because humanity were at points were science wasn’t yet truly integrated into our arsenal of tools or the use of those drugs were banned. 

We can see the magnificent tip of the iceberg but there are so many more things we likely don’t even know we don’t see. Psychedelics have taught us that there are so many things we don’t understand about our being, our experience, and our consciousness, and that lesson still likely rings true"
