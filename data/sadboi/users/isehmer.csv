1. Birth control (the pill, IUD, etc)  does not guarantee pain relief, and absolutely does not stop the progression of endo. (that is ridiculous and a red flag) Endometriosis effects everyone differently, some people get relief from birth control but it is not an effective form of treatment (it’s not treatment at all) 
2. Endometriosis is only confirmed through laparoscopic surgery, a doctor that “diagnoses” you and then says it’s too small to remove is also a red flag. Ablation is not effective. Excision is the only way to get rid of the disease and an endometriosis specialist will be able to remove every bit of it. (Yes even the tiny tiny spots) Even the tiny spots can cause excruciating pain. You should be seeing an endometriosis specialist not this doctor. 
3. Lupron, and orilissa are not effective in treating endo, and they will do more harm than good in the long run. They are terrible terrible drugs. (so if these are ever suggested to you - another huge red flag)

I’m not restricting myself during the day, for some reason I literally just don’t get hungry until I get off work. I have never been a huge breakfast eater (i will occasionally) but eating in the morning just isn’t my cup of tea & then I don’t even think about lunch when lunch time comes around. It’s just convenient and when i get hungry when i have my first meal. I also stay up until 2 or 3 am (which i know it’s bad to eat right before bed but it’s when i’m hungry) I sleep in until about 10 everyday and then work from 11-5 
(this is my summer schedule) Honestly it’s just college that has made the time that i eat really weird, but i do feel like i’m eating enough. Sure i could make healthier choices and i should, but this is the first time in my life where i’m not restricting myself i just want to enjoy a cinnamon roll once a week before bed if i really want too🤣

Thank you for your advice about boundaries, my mother and boyfriend both are the sweetest most loving people i know. I know they don’t mean to hurt my feelings, but they just don’t know my issues with food. (My mom does but she’s just a very healthy eater in general so i think she will always encourage me to be a clean eater as well) 
I agree boundaries are important and your message helped a lot :) Thank you."

However my two roommates when i lived there were grad students and the third was undergrad. The apartments are on jolly rd about 10 min off campus. If you’re not trying to be super close to campus it might be a really good fit, there’s a cata bus route the bus comes every hour on the hour. 
Cheap, relatively nice, fully furnished, can’t beat it for the price. 
24 hr fitness center, 2 hot tubs, 2 pools, computers and printers in the lounge, and tanning beds... I was content living there. 

I’m assuming you might be a member of the MSU housing page on facebook? I see a lot of people that try to sublease their rooms in houses or apartments for often times pretty cheap ($350-$450) however , again you’d be living with probably undergrad or other grad students and i’m not sure if that’s what you’re looking for. 

I saw a post on the Okemos community page ... an older couple had a really large room in their house for rent and it was SUPER cheap. I’ll try to find a link or something but joining a surrounding city or even the lansing community page on facebook and writing this same post will hopefully give you better answers!"

Endo,etdsvoh,t1_etdmjvy,1562714395.0,"I just had my laparoscopic excision surgery 11 days ago and I feel tremendously better.  I had a constant 24/7  pain in my left side that is GONE. I woke up 3 days in a row crying i couldn’t believe how good i felt afterwards. I’m still a little sore as to be expected but I feel like a new person. My mom said she saw the sparkle in my eyes come back after 2 years of debilitating pain. 
As for as preparing , make sure you’re seeing a true excision specialist. Miralax or a stool softener 1-2 days before surgery is a great idea because you won’t be able to poop for a few days post op. Your shoulders and upper body will probably be very very sore - for me that was the worst part of recovery but everyone is different. The soreness comes from the CO2 gas.
