Just trying to keep my opinion more honest than comforting for this post. I live this situation very well in real life. If i didnt have family to live with, id have no one. Try not to look at things so much in a negative light. It can be better for your health in the long run. Times will hurt some times.

Cuz those chips basically have built in memory supporting technology that can basically double the effectiveness of your performance surrounding your memory. Its called the infinity fabric. You can basically go with buying say 2000 mhz memory. Then manually adjusting the memory speed with the fabric at a one to one ratio or basically 2000mhz to 2000mhz, which will basically give you more performance in that area far beyond 2000 mhz while saving you money.

pcgamingtechsupport,fpr0cnp,t3_gf167r,1588837954.0,"Looks like a solid build. You will have to flash the bios for that motherboard though so that the cpu will actually function on that. The cpu should already come with a cooler as well if you didnt want to include the extra charge on the separate one you put on that list. You should be able to use a second monitor and run a stream off that. Since the gpu is a 1660, i believe you should be able to use the nvenc streaming encoder for that so the cpu doesnt get used nearly as much for that. You graphics quality may be limited to medium settings if you try to play near that monitors max refresh at that resolution. Over all seems solid though. If you were to put Th at cooler money back into the gpu though, you may be able to afford a used rtx nvidia card. Theres a new feature that works really well for those cards too called nvidia voice. It uses artificial intelligence to basically remove any background noise detected by your mic like loud cars outside or keyboard sounds. I use it myself now for the past week. Superb feature. The feature is only available on rtx cards so thats why i mention. Also with an rtx card you can get access to shadowing or ray tracing features as well. If you buy a seperate cooler though and plan on overclocking past the auto boost feature in the bios, youll probably want to look into a tower style air cooler with one higher quality fan on it or two at best. Alright. Think thats about it unless i forgot any thing. Lol. Good luck. Oh. And if you go used on everything, can prob save yourself some more money to put into other things like an even better graphics card or something. A second generation amd apu cpu would prob be worth looking into as well to give you an extra graphical boost while still using the same socket type on the motherboard and without needing a bios update. Or you can still look into the third gen of that same one for higher performance but that will require update on that board type ofcourse. Dang. I keep thinking of new stuff. Lol. You really dont need to consider the nvme drive either. Just get a reliable quality ssd with higher storage by samsung or something. Oh yea. You could def raise that storage to a terabyte easily if you just go for a sata ssd instead of nvme. If you plan on using wifi with that set up too, youll need to buy a wifi card for that. Not sure if that motherboard comes with built in wifi already. You actually may be able to get a used second gen ryzen 7 for around same price if not cheaper? Cuz that chip can def handle multitasking for your task pretty well and has quite acceptable performance. Just no addition graphics cuz its not an apu. Any more questions, hmu. Sorry for the read. Lol. I normally dont have this much to say but you became my target for the day. Lol"
