AskReddit,fpjofzn,t3_gdn8w2,1588675989.0,"A lot of things. But one in particular. To never sneak out of my 12 year old child's bed to my own room where a guest is sleeping, so I can fuck the ""guest"" then come back to sleep beside my child. And pretend to have not noticed my daughter's tears as she sat there traumatized."
AmItheAsshole,fp5qs27,t3_gbb19z,1588337692.0,"NTA. Is your wife by chance an America born caucasian? Because her argument sounds like a very ""Karen"" thing to do.   She also pulled the ""In America"" card which is ridiculous. I don't know about everyone but it felt like it was a tiny bit of her internal racism peeking out. 

I'm 19 and trilingual, my family never had a problem with me learning English, they actually encouraged me and take my help when they need some translation. It gives your children a better understanding of your culture, which is important on your part even if its just 1/4 of your life. You shouldn't stop your children from learning new things just because your wife feels like she isn't evolved or feels like you're bitching about her with your children. She sounds extremely insecure and pessimistic. If she has a probelm you can ask her to learn along the kids so that way she knows you all are only having harmless conversations and are not on this secret misssion to sabotage her monolingual self."

mentalhealth,fjcba8e,t3_fcpmfm,1583213946.0,"there are instances where you could have avoided some of the incidents. If you were thinking rationally you'd not invite a man taking advantage of you to a trip to ""the city of love."" While also clearly knowing he doesn't take no for an answer. 


But none of your vulnerability or high of emotions excuses the thing he did to you, that man was selfish, cruel and blatantly taking advantage of you,  you who weren't emotionally stable and still grieving. The abuse was not in your head and you have every right to think so, there were multiple times this man emotionally manipulated you into agreeing to do stuff with him and all the trauma that came with it is real.

I suggest seeing a therapist specifically handling cases of emotional and sexual harrasmemt, the one you visited might not have been the best choice.

I hope for your smooth recovery and a better life, that your problems find their place and you find peace in living your life soon <3"
