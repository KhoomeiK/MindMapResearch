I ask if they’re originally from where we are (because that’s rare) and if they say no I ask where are they from. I love traveling so I try to connect with people on it. If OP told me they were Arab I’d be fascinated to know more and ask do they ever go back to visit, how often, has it changed a lot, if I go one day where should I go and what should I see. I also love asking about food and if there are any food places where we are that make food from their culture that they highly recommend and I usually go check it out.

I’ve lived in Central FL for a looooong time and although I dislike being here, a lot of what they said was just them over-exaggerating.  I dislike the heat yet I wouldn’t say we have gross weather. It’s been downright beautiful this past week or so to the point where I feel like I’m back in SoCal. I don’t see a lot of old people where I’m at. Or lambos. That sounds like a south Florida/Boca problem. 

I disagree with you on the hurricane bit though. Charley, Francis and Jean knocked our electricity out and put a tree on our house. It was hot during the day and it wasn’t good at night either. Opening the windows made it worse. Where I live breezes come to die. 

I don’t see a lot of snowbirds or tourists where I am. Good thing about being near the theme parks is that they all stay in a concentrated area and that area is easily avoidable for me.

cheating_stories,foaj2k7,t3_g6h7qc,1587647445.0,"I went through something similar in my family. My dad cheated on my mom when I was around that same age and had a child. I didn’t find out until years and years later. I pieced together things that my mom had told me about that time and realized that she also lost a pregnancy around that same time. My mom knew about the cheating yet, similar to your mom, after leaving she came back. I was upset with my dad when I found out. Really upset. I cried. I screamed. I felt myself loving my mom more and casting aside my dad until I realized something. 

This had nothing to do with me. 

The cheating was between my mom and my dad. That obstacle was for them to figure out, not me and it seems like they had figured it out on their own. I was upset (and you’re definitely allowed to be) yet it happened in the past and there was nothing I could or should do about it. That was their job to deal with their relationship. My job was to be mindful of my relationship to my parents, not their relationship to one another. 

My dad is a great dad. He does so much for our family even to this day. Whether he’s a good husband or not, as his child, isn’t my business quite frankly. Whether my mom is a good wife or not again isn’t my business. She’s a great mom and that’s all I need. 

Rather than confront your dad about it, it may be a better idea to speak to your mom. Let her determine what she’d like to do or how she’d like to handle it. Remember you’re bringing up hurtful memories for her. Also, before doing that, I’d think about what your motivation is in doing this and what do you hope to accomplish. If it’s just to let them know that you know, I wouldn’t feel good about saying anything again because I would be bringing up possible pain for my mom and even for my dad."

I have a great set of friends (also from childhood, well, high school) who love me in so many ways to the point where I’m beyond grateful for them yet there are days where I just want “my” person. I reflected on what I was doing wrong. Was it me? Am I not attractive enough? Do I look standoffish? Am I sending off the wrong vibe? 

Then I realized that I don’t do anything in my daily life where the goal is to meet new people. The majority of my hobbies aren’t social hobbies. I don’t put myself in positions to meet people and not just a “hi hello nice meeting you we’ll never see each other again k goodbye” type situation yet one where people will get the chance to see me often and get to know me. A lot of my friends who have partners it’s because they either met in college (classes, sororities/fraternities, sports etc), they met in salsa classes/groups or its been via volunteering or other social things like that. Before all of this started I spent 2 whole months saying “yes” to every invite my friends gave me. I met 4 guys, 3 of which I could see myself with and it progressed yet for personal reasons I had to step back.

internetparents,fmtvhne,t3_fxb7ih,1586379724.0,"Your title is super misleading. 

I struggle with understanding how despite putting the dots together you still acted selfishly. It’s one thing to not care about your own well being yet it’s something entirely different when you take away someone else’s choice of being healthy and potentially remaining alive. Not only 3 people who have weaker immune systems yet *people who you are supposed to love and care about*. People who have taken the time to birth you, to raise you, to provide what they can for you. People who have dedicated their lives to keeping you safe, valuing you and even right now, protecting you. That’s what trips me up. They have most likely done so much for you and you didn’t think of how this would impact them. Either you didn’t think or you didn’t care. 

Let’s zoom out though. Anyone that you have come in contact with during that time is at risk and anyone *they* have come in contact with is also at risk. That means someone who has been following orders and doing everything they can to stay healthy has now been put at risk unnecessarily. How is that okay? 

Zooming out more. Have you thought of how this impacts healthcare workers? If someone in your household has to go to the hospital (I hope not), that’s another bed, another set of medical staff and other limited resources that have to be utilized because you didn’t care. And if someone goes to the hospital, know that they’ll be there alone without any family members. Can you imagine your brother sitting in a hospital bed with no one familiar around him because the hospital doesn’t want to run the risk of others catching C19? What about your mom? Your dad? There aren’t any hospital visits. 

I want to be with my friends. I actually want to go to my office yet when this thing broke and they let us know what people were at the highest risk I immediately removed myself from public spaces because I live with 3 people (my mom, my dad and ironically my younger brother) who are all in the at risk group for multiple reasons. I even stay in my bedroom most of the time because I don’t want to run the risk of them catching anything. When someone needs to go to the store, I volunteer. If we need food, I volunteer. If anyone needs to go outside where there are going to be several people I go because I’m at less risk than they are. I go outside alone. I exercise outside alone. *I do everything alone because there is no activity on this earth that is worth more than the health and lives of my family members.* 

You asked for advice. Follow what doctors and those in knowledgeable fields are telling you. You didn’t follow it in the beginning for whatever selfish reason yet follow it now. You can’t stop your dad from tending to you yet I’d beg my dad to stop because he could be infecting the family if I already haven’t. My aunt has C19 and double pneumonia (both lungs I suppose) and she’s on an oxygen tank. She’s been isolating herself in her room because there’s a small child in the house. Read up on what you should do and *follow it*. Dwelling on what you did isn’t going to make it go away yet you really need to reflect on your decisions because that’s a reflection of who you are as a person."

I was a first generation minority transfer student and not once did I visit someone at the Career Center. I went for my masters (clinical mental health counseling) and was required to take a career counseling class and it opened my eyes to a lot about my own personal career path and decisions. During my internship I realized that mental health and career tie in together. If one is off balance, the other comes tumbling down within a period of time. Mental health got heavy so once I graduated I sought out career counseling positions to take a mini break. 

I love all of the students that come through those doors or speak with me virtually. For the same reason I loved mental health counseling. I enjoy students coming to me with their box of puzzle pieces, dumping them on my desk and asking me to help them figure out how to put the pieces together. My favorite facial expression is when someone has an epiphany or just realized something about themselves. Those deep, pensive moments that they emerge from are the moments that keep me going.

AskReddit,flh6hqj,t1_flg4yqf,1585156982.0,"They are sounds you don’t ever get out of your head. I work as a 911 operator and I remember a call we had from a lady who had hit something on the highway. She had an infant in the back. She just kept repeating that she thought her baby was dead. Over and over again. We couldn’t get a location from her. People were calling in saying that there was a car accident yet because it was a long stretch of highway with nothing but trees, no one could give us a location. We sent officers to every place that was told to us yet we couldn’t find her. My friend is on the phone with her and tears are just rolling down her face as this woman is screaming about her child. Reports are now coming in that a car is on fire. Someone gives us a location but when officers get there it’s not her. It’s a separate car accident. My friend is still on the phone. The lady’s car is on fire too and she’s not getting out of the car because of her baby. My friend listened to this woman burn alive. My friend was crying underneath her desk, holding herself because there was nothing she could do. We were all frantically trying to find where the lady was. We found her after she and her baby died. 

It’s horrifying to hear things like that and it’s always made me curious as to why people seek out those things. Both audibly and visually."
GlobalTalk,fl93on2,t1_fl7lvqp,1584939990.0,"I’m over in Orlando and we had to beg and plead with Disney to close Disney Springs. One of our smaller theme parks “Fun Spot” is closing on the 23rd. Most of the shelves in Publix are mainly empty because people are stress hoarding. They changed their hours and they’re also holding special hours for seniors (thank goodness). UCF is down to essentially staff mainly yet I feel they may still have some students still living on campus (not everyone can go home). I still see photos of friends and their families at the beach, both young and old. We’re under curfew from 11pm-5am. All the bars and gyms are closed (finally). Restaurants have gone to take out orders only if not shut down completely. A lot of us are trying to buy local because those businesses seem to be getting hit the hardest during this."
SeriousConversation,fl63at5,t3_fmr9tu,1584853079.0,"I’m struggling WFH because of this sentiment. I don’t want my employer to feel as if I’m taking advantage of this situation to just sit in my pajamas and watch Teen Titan reruns all day. I struggle because a lot of my job doesn’t fully translate into remote work. 80% of my day deals with meeting with students. Right now students are traveling back home or dealing with other things and not thinking about my office (yet). We have to give a weekly report of what we’ve done to show that we were working for 8 hours yet mine looks pretty sparse. One meeting here. 5-9 emails over there. I just hope they know that I’m taking it seriously. I answer their emails within minutes. Their phone calls are picked up immediately. Their messages returned almost instantly. I message the entire office at 8am to say good morning just so no one questions whether I was awake at the right time or not. It’s giving me anxiety because I don’t want to mess it up for anyone else. I’m just grateful that my supervisor told me they don’t expect me to work every single minute of my work day and to essentially, chill the fuck out and relax."

AskMen,fl4bp7n,t3_fmakk1,1584810157.0,"I was going for this really sought after internship in my graduate program. I go in for the interview, everything is going great until they ask me a certain question. I start to answer the question and then I just burst into tears. Like not those cute tears streaming down your face stuff that you can play off as allergies. I’m talking full blown water works. I put my head down to try and calm myself and everyone is attending to console me. I finish the interview and go to my car to call my parents to cry some more. 

2 weeks later I get an email from the internship site and they chose me. Apparently they took me bursting into tears as not being afraid to be vulnerable and that I’m genuine and authentic. 

I feel they felt bad for making me cry lol but hey! I finished the internship!

AskMen,fl2aauf,t1_fl25dc3,1584746464.0,Ugh I’ve had that happen too. I feel there isn’t really a win situation. With my best guy friend though due to the intimacy we spoke about it. I let him know what I was fearful of happening and he said he’d always advocate for me. What they all tell me is “any girl who can’t accept you I don’t feel I can be with”. They say that then yet once they fall in love it changes. So before it gets to that point I bow out. He won’t let me though. Said he’d always go to bat for me and will forever do so. We’ll see! He really likes this girl and I’m ready to like her and get to know her too!
AskMen,fl21no0,t1_fl1p1t3,1584740939.0,I’m a 31F with a lot of close male friends. When I see that they’re getting closer to a girl I attempt to become more of a background character to avoid putting them in a position where they feel they have to choose. Or even to prevent some one sided unnecessary drama. I’ve been friends with my group of guys for 16-17 years.  With my male best friend it’s very intimate (not physically) and he’s talking to this girl. He’s asked me not to fade into the background and instead wants me to get to know the girl. This doesn’t usually turn out well 😬

AskMen,fkx7qyl,t3_fl5ua1,1584621391.0,"I lived on a military base and there were always a lot of kids to play with. The streets were called Lower Lewis, Middle Lewis and Upper Lewis. Our school made a big deal about the Olympics one year so we decided to throw our own Olympics with kids from each street representing their street. We did little events year round. Snowboarding, kickball, monkey bar relay races (monkey bars, bike riding down the hill then back up the hill, running and then skateboarding), basketball free throw contest, igloo building, pine cone wars etc. It was great! I’m still in contact with some of them years later. 

Oh and also the one day we wanted to have a snow day and thought that if we piled all the snow into the middle of the road the bus wouldn’t be able to get to us and school would be cancelled. The bus drove right over it and we went to school sad."

SeriousConversation,fkv88uy,t1_fkv3oz8,1584564063.0,"They seem to be comparing those who are social versus those who aren't as social and interpreting it as extroverts versus introverts. I'm a social introvert who loves being around people so much that I went into a field that requires me to speak to people for the majority of the day. 

I also have anxiety and I don't feel trapped by this situation. To put it as black and white as ""introvert versus extrovert"" and ""anxiety versus non anxiety"" is to really discount the experiences and personalities of others."
SeriousConversation,fkv7kwz,t1_fkv05pg,1584563689.0,">However, based on my few experiences I've had with my more sociable friends

I get what you're trying to say in this post yet we shouldn't paint something with a large brush when we have a small amount of paint. When we do that we leave ourselves open to examples that show the opposite. 

I feel a lot of what you've written may be how (assuming you identify as an introvert with anxiety) your introversion and anxiety manifest itself. I identify as an introvert who has had anxiety (GAD) since I was 4 (I remember my first attack at 7) and I can't relate to 

>The feeling of thinking ""wow, I'm going to be stuck in this ordeal for a while, and no matter how much I don't like it, there's no escape.

Personally my anxiety doesn't allow me to think that there is no escape. For me, that sounds more like depression. My anxiety causes me to search for things that I can control and if I can't control something I either become agitated or what is usually the case, I create something to control. Usually my surroundings. 

Introversion and extroversion fall on a spectrum. The majority of extroverts still have introversion in them and vice versa. I value my alone time (just as the extroverts I know) yet I also value being around others (which is not unheard of for introverts). As for your friends, you said it yourself, they aren't used to not being able to go out every day of every week. Most people get antsy or lost when their daily routines are turned on their heads. Try changing the schedule or habits of a child and trust me, they aren't all extroverted. For the social people you're describing I'd call them just that. **Social**. 

Generally, those who are more social than those who are not are going to have a difficult time adjusting yet the majority of them will adjust by finding other ways to socialize."
