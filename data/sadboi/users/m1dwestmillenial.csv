EdAnonymousAdults,fiu8xqf,t1_fiqnafl,1582737157.0,"I hear that haha and I would say the same thing BUT I have pretty severe depression and a lack of focus. Lots of anxiety. A deadly triad. I have borderline personality disorder, and unfortunately there is no medication for that, so all we can do is attack the symptoms on the fringes. I’ve been on antidepressants for the past 5 years, going back and forth from med to med, and the only combo that’s kept me going at it (aka living life productively) consistently is a low dose of Adderall + my antidepressant + mood stabilizer. But the Adderall has the appetite suppressing effect. Probably my anxiety controls my ED, the Adderall enables. I don’t know how to be like, “I would rather have an issue where I am underweight than not function.”"
EdAnonymousAdults,fip8og5,t3_f8wh9i,1582600512.0,"I had this weird thing where I literally pooped only mucus for like 4 days. I freaked out and my doctor said to eat more fiber. My friend said it happened to her when she wasn’t eating. So I tried eating consistent meals. I didn’t poop for another 3 days, then I pooped. 

This was when I was switching meds and also working half days, half nights, so everything was out of whack. This is also when I realized I might have an ED."

BorderlinePDisorder,fim9exh,t1_filtwoc,1582522091.0,"TL; DR: I’m on my 3rd Plan B this month and last night I exposed myself to gonorrhea VOLUNTARILY because I can only exist in chaos. 

I’ve been there. I went through a time period when I slept with sooooo many people over the span of a few months. For absolutely no reason. No protection. And this is a small town. Everyone knows everyone - like, two degrees of separation. 

I ended up picking up two “high-risk” strains of HPV. Did that stop me from hooking up? Nope. Did it make me want to start using better protection? Absolutely the fuck not. Apparently no one cares about HPV or gets tested because it’s the “common cold” of STIs. So I probably have 6 strains by now because nobody knows if they have it. 

I recently decided I wanted to get “unnatural chemicals” out of my body and experience my hormones for what they are. Needless to say I’ve taken Plan B three times this month. 

And I’m in limbo right now because the person I slept with yesterday openly told me they had gonorrhea from a recent hook-up and needed to get it treated this week, and that we should wait to hook-up for few weeks so it’s safe. 

Enter: alcohol. 

That went out the window. So did condoms. And I spent my afternoon today trying to figure out exactly how long I need to wait to go test for this (so it’ll show up) and get treated."
BorderlinePDisorder,filnypv,t3_f8i33y,1582506108.0,"Feel this. 

They diagnosed me with borderline before they diagnosed me with ADHD. Sometimes symptoms mimic each other. Honestly, Adderall has helped me stay on track (not the same for everyone). It’s helped me be present and the noisy thoughts and emotions don’t have such a strong grip on me. Even if I don’t feel like it, I can still do the things and have forethought about the things. Forethought has been a huge one I’ve appreciated.

Are you currently on stimulant medication for ADHD? You mentioned it before, but then also said you self-medicated with weed. Is it both? 

Both my ADHD and borderline get so much worse when I drink. And my meds won’t work when I drink. It takes about 4 days for alcohol to totally clear the system, so for about 2 years I constantly had it in my system. I got much better when I took a long break from drinking. How often do you have alcohol?"

EDAnonymous,fid4vn5,t1_fic358b,1582362465.0,"I had a date the other night. 

What I said: “can we actually do drinks, not dinner? I’m doing this cLeAn EaTiNg thing and restaurants have way too much sodium for me, I get sick when I eat out now.” 

What I meant to say: “I don’t eat out, the food is not safe for a variety of reasons I will reinforce on a daily basis by reading about it online. Restaurants make me sick because my stomach will physically not fit the food. And I won’t actually eat the food, I’ll waste it, subsequently wasting YOUR money. I will eat exactly an apple and peanut butter, and then I will have exactly one vodka cranberry (can only drink one or I’m drunk) followed by a black coffee (so I’m not drunk) at the bar (I pick the bar).”

So yeah - food you can’t prepare yourself, scary. My unsafe “safe” food is Jiffy peanut butter even though it’s not organic, and it has rape seed in it, and rape seed can trigger migraines, which for some reason I am fixated on."
