AustralianMakeup,fpqmiax,t3_fvszdq,1588826341.0,"I purchased the ‘smooth’ shampoo and conditioner from MONDAY to later find out it has silicone in it! It makes your hair appear to be shiny soft but in reality has caused me scalp irritation and dandruff and will cause long term damage to my hair. 

I looked into the ingredients as I found a lot of negative backlash the brand was having online and there are a lot of toxins despite being labelled Paraben free. A great reminder to myself to always check the ingredients first

I do not recommend. There are other natural alternatives available for the same pricing."
