Millennials only thought they were so important because our boomer parents or whoever else in our lives told us it was.

Of course that is a pretty far out there career plan but I was fucking 10 and my mom said ""Yeah you'll never do that pick something you can actually do.""

Then when it came time for college I wanted to study theatre. I spent all of highschool learning sound, lighting, and other behind the scenes stuff and working a lot of union productions thanks to my teacher. My parents told me if I want to study that I'd be on my own because I'd never make a career out of that. 

10 years later I don't do live theatre anymore because I didn't really want to move around a lot or tour but I use my knowledge for lighting and audio to do video work and live stream work for myself and clients. 

Them telling me I couldn't do something did two things to me. One it made me doubt myself a lot. I regularly doubt my skills and knowledge even though deep down I know that I know what I'm doing. I pass up a lot of opportunities for fear of failure. But it also made me somewhat resentful. Now if someone says I can't do something I have to be the stubborn person to prove them wrong.
