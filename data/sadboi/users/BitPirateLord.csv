So the store was run by this gruff looking old mexican guy and when I got all my stuff and asked ""how much is all this"" in my best spanish, and after he told me the amount, he told my parents in spanish, ""you kid needs to learn how to speak spanish"" right in front of me.

reason why this irked me was because, me and my mother have similar skin tones. which is already quite light-skinned. but just because i don't look ""mexican"", the shopkeeper thinks i don't know how to speak spanish at all."

Taking the weighted averages of my bust sizes according to the guide and dividing it by 5 gives me 93.2 if the leaning bust is 94 cm, (~37 in) and 93 if the leaning bust is 93.5 cm, (~36.81 in). 

Subtracting the first measurement that i said, (94 cm), with my loose underbust which is 83 cm, (~32.67 in), gives me 10.2 cm which is ~4 inches which gives me an initial cup size of D. Doing the same with the second measurement gives me 10 cm which is ~3.93 inches which gives me an initial cup size of C/D.

Subtracting my loose underbust with my band size and dividing it by 2 gives me 5. I don't know whether to round it up to 6 or down to 4. 

If it's rounding up, dividing 6 by 2 gives me 3. If it's rounding down, than dividing 4 by 2 gives me 2. My loose underbust is larger than my band size which would mean I have to ""increase"" my cup size by 2 or 3. I also don't know how to do that part. Thanks for helping, btw.
