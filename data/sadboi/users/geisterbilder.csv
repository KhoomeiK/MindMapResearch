i'm currently starting out with a therapist who i hope can help dismantle and reprocess all the reasons for that painful self-awareness. hang in there, friend. i won't ever say i know the ins and outs of living with bpd. my best friend who i recently ended my friendship with having bpd gives me some insight, though. and i hope you find some lasting inner peace, both from yourself and from the world. i'm rooting for you."

mentalillness,fp3w45r,t3_gawoms,1588286902.0,"I don't exactly have advice here, just a sigh of relief finding someone who experiences something similar. Nostalgia isn't a ""trigger"" for me, per se. It's a whole lot I don't understand, but in a similar vein where I feel stupid or pathetic for having a fear or an aversion to media that I otherwise enjoy. 

In my case, I'm currently really affected by anything Steven Universe or Animal Crossing; either makes me one of either terribly sad, angry, or disgusted. I had to go through my Instagram feed and ""Not Interested"" every post related to either, which, again with the feeling of being pathetic. 

Neither of us are. Both of us deserve to enjoy the content we're interested in without feeling scared or guilty. The best thing I can suggest is to start with very small exposure and work your way up if you can. Just a minute or two, then more if it's possible for you. 

I wish you the best of luck, friend. Keep trying. You have my support."

therapy,fp3f0vv,t3_gb2sg3,1588278164.0,"First off, I am so sorry that someone who's supposed to be a mental health professional could be so invalidating and unsupportive. People like that disgust me. Why go into the field if you're determined to be counterproductive?

It's in a therapist's *job description* to listen to your issues and help you understand and work on them session by session. Of course you should be reaching out to other people in your life, but it's not professional or ethical to just blow you off when you're seeking help. 

I suggest seeking a different therapist. Quitting therapy altogether doesn't sound like something that will benefit you, and neither does continuing with her. There are so many qualified, good-hearted people out there who'll be much more receptive to your needs. Help is out there. It just takes a few tries sometimes.

Best of luck with this, friend. Keep trying. You deserve it."

mentalillness,fm616jf,t3_ft3r5z,1585784135.0,"Boy, is this my cue. Your position sounds like mine nearly to a T with my best friend of two years. Long story short, I'm their favorite person, have been nearly since we met, and I'm carrying around depression and anxiety of my own. Not fun, as I'm sure you know. 

First off, I see ""only friend"" and the alarms sound because, while BPD friendships are enriching and deeply fulfilling, they can also be draining and *intense.* It took me a year into our friendship to venture outside of our two-person bubble. I wish I'd made an effort sooner. Friends, outlets, *other connections*, they're gonna be your Holy Grail. Supporting without support guarantees burnout. Seek other connections, meaningful ones.

Remember always that you can only do as much as you can do. Their happiness, stability, and well-being are *not your responsibility.* Being terrified that someone is going to hurt themselves gnaws at you. Don't let it get to a point where you can't think about anything else. *Don't* let their problems overtake yours or make you feel like yours aren't valid. 

You're not a pathetic whiny ass if you're sticking by someone at their worst. Just please make sure you keep yourself above water while you do it. Be honest. Set boundaries and ask her to respect them. 

Any questions you might have on my experiences, feel free to ask. You're worth just as much as your friend, so give yourself the light of day."

Same goes for being at rock bottom looking up. Hold yourself above water, friend. Best of luck finding a middle ground."
