schoolpsychology,fpbmdyn,t1_fpb7b2m,1588473377.0,I second MSUM!!
BabyBumps,fkze1b8,t3_fja4uu,1584668812.0,I'm swooning over that rug ðŸ¤©
Anxiety,fdndd4b,t3_em0e7a,1578583388.0,Thanks for the reminder. ðŸ˜…
BabyBumps,fdnd9cc,t3_em497n,1578583322.0,Wisconsin does this as well.
schoolpsychology,fdexr4g,t3_ekyogy,1578348838.0,"I have never personally attended a summer conference, but I have heard great things about them. My colleague said the sessions are more workshop based and the attendance is smaller, so the community aspect is great."
lexapro,fcm6xjt,t3_ehuaxq,1577765820.0,"1. I am a graduate student and have found Lex to have no impact on my memory or cognition. 
2. I found Lex to increase my appetite. It is more of a want to eat rather than an impact on my metabolism.
3. I have found a decrease in libido, but can still orgasm."
Anxiety,fcm647e,t3_ehp798,1577765205.0,That's a huge step!! I remember how anxious I was about my drivers test and that was almost 10 years ago. Congrats!! You're brave.
lexapro,fcm5rx6,t3_ehwqxl,1577764958.0,I take it at night because it makes me drowsy. It's also easier for me to remember to take it. It is part of my routine.
GilmoreGirls,fcm5611,t3_ehnbdm,1577764513.0,Envious! I have been considering buying myself a set in case they ever remove it from Netflix.
lexapro,fcm4rnw,t3_ehum7e,1577764221.0,"I know you are strong. I know you are an advocate for your mental health. You wouldn't be on medication & seeking help from others if you weren't. I encourage you to remember why you began your journey with Lexapro. I speak as someone who is on the other side... better days are ahead. One step at time, friend. Don't stop. Keep going."
DontFuckWithCats,fbkj0j2,t3_edqv3f,1576951132.0,I had to stop watching. It made my skin crawl.
schoolpsychology,fakhelw,t3_e9iczr,1576167178.0,I don't think ABA & School Psychology can be compared. They're very different.
lexapro,f9ca2zi,t1_f9c0dap,1575221091.0,I didn't know this either. I have definitely taken dayquil/nyquil while on Lexapro.
lexapro,f5ajllm,t3_dnfsz2,1572108644.0,Yes!
lexapro,f2yrn3p,t3_deprrm,1570496794.0,"I would definitely talking with your doc, but mine said it was okay. I am taking Lexapro & TTC."
lexapro,ezjrd6x,t1_ezjqqbd,1567949132.0,Thanks! Just wanted to check.
predaddit,eyrrv80,t3_cyf11l,1567376568.0,We are trying for #2 right now as well. Congratulations :)
cat,exd9qd1,t3_cqdozr,1566170892.0,Thanks for the tips!
GilmoreGirls,ew48hwk,t3_cmo6y5,1565105226.0,The thing about her that annoys me the most is that she thinks she can be aggressive with Dean & Jess. Like when she goes into the market while Dean is working & yells at him. Or running through Luke's apartment practically swearing looking for Jess.
Swimming,eu4h8ym,t3_cenyiu,1563453835.0,Wow! You're amazing! Congratulations!
schoolpsychology,eth1aqj,t3_cbif88,1562803468.0,"So many individuals in my program are far removed from undergrad. A gap year or two to rest & get your plans in place would no biggie at all. The field of school psychology will still be here, I promise."
lexapro,espntj8,t3_c8jofn,1562187176.0,I was in the same boat. Do you have anyone that can come keep you company the first 24 hours? My husband stayed up with me until I fell asleep that first night.
lexapro,eslt3k0,t3_c871m7,1562091529.0,I take it around 8PM & by 9PM I am struggling to keep my eyes open. I take it with a melatonin as prescribed by my doctor which helps to relax me.
NewParents,erxmmul,t3_c4nhe3,1561388558.0,The Chicco Key Fit Zip with the Keyfit Caddy was the best baby purchase we made. I am a SAHM & being able to easily pack up baby & pop into stores is the only reason I was able to leave the house those first few months.
Swimming,er9qwh3,t1_er9okmy,1560628240.0,I agree. The Mom & Lifeguard in me got worried when I heard that.
relationships,er8r4zb,t1_er882pv,1560610177.0,Yes! Yes! Yes! I would advise you have a conversation with him about how damaging this type of behavior is for littles.
TryingForABaby,er2y9mc,t3_c066q6,1560452138.0,"I had been on BC for a few years before trying for a baby. We conceived immediately after I stopped taking the pill. So, even though it may take a couple months for your body to sort itself out, I wouldn't count on it. Good luck!"
xxketo,eq9xtbm,t1_eq9xq7e,1559920463.0,Yes! Please share! Salt & Vinegar chips are a weakness.
NewParents,eosrkad,t3_bt0oi0,1558828048.0,"I am right there with you, friend."
minnesota,eolo74o,t1_eoljbjq,1558673797.0,Yes!!! I saw a little kid almost get hit in a crosswalk by a person speeding through a school zone. I don't understand why people think they are *above* the law? Or why where they're going is more important than a little guy just trying to toddle home from 2nd grade. UGH.
NewParents,eoitt6s,t1_eoisihe,1558627166.0,Good point! You would have to have the live feed constantly running in order to hear your baby.
NewParents,eoilb7j,t3_bry6lt,1558622189.0,"We bought a Nest camera. It is technically not a baby monitor, but it works well & can be streamed to a PC. Then when baby no longer needs to be monitored you can move it to another area of the house & repurpose it."
