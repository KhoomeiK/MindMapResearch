depression,fh3bp3b,t3_eu7fur,1581267161.0,"I've been to this point, I had a few thoughts that kept me from losing it. Today I'm pretty much fine, probably because of it and those thoughts making me see everything reasonable. It might sound like bs to some of you but it also might help somebody else so I will share it here, even though I hate talking about stuff like this. 
The thoughts are, you're at a point in life where you are in constant pain. Taking your life might change that, but you won't know. In anyway you will hurt people, even though you might think you're worth nothing to them, you're. You taking your life will destroy others, so is your life worth more then theirs? 
But moreover there is one thought that helped me, you have to think life currently sucks, but it might change. If you take your life right now, you just wasted a possible opportunity. There is no chance to go back. Life is currently like a film starting of very bad, but if you keep watching it, it might be your favourite one. But how can you find out if you don't watch it? You have to suffer a bit (i know it's a lot!) now, but if you fight until it gets better, you might think one day that it was worth it. And if it doesn't change, you wasted a bit of your ethernal time, which isn't much of a sacrifice. In anyway, fighting will make you stronger (believe me I got all my self esteem and strength because of this). And life is not about being always happy and having everything as you want it to, it's about trying to become a better person with every day you spend on earth. 
And you're a currently at a point where you have nothing left to loose, why don't try working with that, you're not really afraid of death, so why should you be afraid about anything? Just live life, without fear. Make the best of it and think of every day as an opportunity. 
But most importantly talk to your parents/ family/ friends/ professional help and tell them everything, I know it's the hardest thing to admit weakness. It takes the most strength to do so. But just think that you were about to commit suicide, what have you left to lose? Just try it."
