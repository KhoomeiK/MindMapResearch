TrueDoTA2,fr02tfz,t3_glht11,1589782080.0,Ember is hard to use and easy to beat in lane. Lower mmr players cant play the hero to its full potential and lose the lane too hard with him often. They also dont know what to do once the lane goes poorly. High mmr players fix both these issues. Theyre skilled enough to play a difficult hero and theyre good enough to not get destroyed in lane. You might think “well wouldnt good mmr players also just destroy ember in lane?” Not necessarily because high mmr players know what to do when the lanes goes bad or how to itemize to do better in the lane and can potentially out play their opponent if they know how use the hero (which they do as i mentioned in the beginning). Hope this helps.

TrueDoTA2,fpgpsd6,t3_gd7uat,1588607301.0,"So watched the first game am only only going discuss your early and mid game. I'm going to make this as short and straight forward as possible because there's A LOT I can talk about.

Ask for 2 tangos from your teammates and buy a faire fire instead of the tangos. (if they didnt give it to you then your items were fine). You kinda waste your spark wraiths in the beginning a lot. Don't just randomly throw out into the lane hoping it'll hit luna. Try to save your mana early on or use it to try to secure the range creep. It'll usually hit the enemy hero or the range creep. I noticed u buy a lot of clarities. Buy 0-2 mangos for the laning statge but once you're like lvl6+ u can use clarities instead since you will jungling more. I would also recommend even getting a basilius after your 2 wraith bands for the mana. Another thing is you should be farming the whole early and even some of mid game. I see you randomly walking around and trying assist different lanes. Just farm mainly the mid lane, and jungle creeps till you have your items. I normally don't even help my team until I have mjollnir. If I do help them its with my clone and I have it tp to the tower and assist them. AW is strong enough to carry the game so you don't need to worry about your team falling behind if you don't help them. Lastly, work on your csing. CSing can always be improved and I always see lower mmr players not being good at it yet don't see the importance of improving it. Its probably the most crucial aspect to improving as a dota player.

Good luck."
TrueDoTA2,fpgmblt,t3_gd7x0s,1588605471.0,Take advantage of of lvls 1-4 to harass and CS best u can because of Kunkka's high base damage its a bit hard to deny.

Ladder is really hard unless u play 4v4s only. Anything else you'll prolly lose for like 2 months straight until u get good enough to win some, especially in 1v1s.

Campaign for the lore like u said if u enjoy the whole warcraft storyline.

Only tp to a lane if u can get two kills at least or you have a good rune to get the kills with. OR u can walk to another lane and tp back to middle if theres a rune. Dont go to another lane if u dont get two kills or theres no runes. Therr are cases when u can do it without them but you wont know when to do it. Just farm on your mid hero until u get your first item. Ex: storm kaya, DK radiance or blink, puck blink, etc

Im not sure what heroes you play cuz they all play kinda different and this topic is very broad. Depending on the situation and combination of heroes you’ll have to play differently. I gave you what i do normally but its immortal bracket and might not work for your bracket.

Im pretty sure he lost a lot of acting roles or positions in spots he had before (i think). It then later turns out he was innocent and SHE was the abusive one. He is now suing her back for defamation. And the picture or context follows up what i wrote and her not gaining anything further on johnny depp. Basically shes fucked herself over for trying to make shit up lol.
DotA2,fms9ric,t1_fmpcfdh,1586350582.0,"It's how mobas are in general. League is also really toxic. Its because the next 30-40 minutes of your time is sooooo dependent on your teammates. Not a lot of games have this dynamic where your allies can literally FEED gold and xp to enemy and make your game harder. In dota its a lot harder to win if theres someone either feeding or not wanting to play. Pretty much having no control of winning once a teammate decides they want you guys to lose.

Not saying this for only like intentional feeders but even when someone isn't intentionally feeding it can still be rough to stay positive. If your mid lane dies twice in the first 5 minutes its def making the game extremely hard. Not saying this is a good reason to flame, ofc its not. I'm just trying to explain where some of the negativity comes from in dota 2.

 I think valve needs to check reports more often and punish people who act this way. Then again i doubt its something they havent already considered. Who knows the right solution."
TrueDoTA2,fmhedpw,t1_fmh9m70,1586076682.0,yeah but think about all the times Terrorblades just metas and goes straight down a lane and takes rax and ends the game in 20 minutes. You only thinking of the games where your team is feeding and trying to make space. TB is extremely good right now because of his farm speed and him being able to just fall back to the jungle and catch up
TrueDoTA2,fmgr7ra,t1_fmgot1c,1586055689.0,Nah. I used to when the spell amp on qop was like 70% but not really that great now.
TrueDoTA2,fmgnct8,t1_fmgl7ql,1586052903.0,"They shouldnt feel underwhelming if u buy it for the correct game. Silver edge is a game changer vs bristle and even abaddon if u have orchiod + silver edge. Aghs i will say is underwhelming if youre losing already but it does has its place. Like i said it really depends on the game and you gotta purchase the correct items for every situation. Some items are generally decent and some are very situational. Like building orchid and ac is prolly gonna be viable 65-70% of the time and the other builds are more for when u need for certain games. 

I already kinda wrote a build path and what i would do for each game and i think u should be looking at it like this. Play your game and think bout the items your buying and whether theyre right for the game or not. After the game dont just say its underwhelming but reflect on what caused it to be that. I think itemizing is very important in dota right now and a lot of people dont mention how important it is.

Even after all this it could be play style difference too. Take what i wrote with a grain of salt. This is my opinion and the way i view it, and based off my experience and play style. I have high mmr so the way my games go are very different to average players. So what youre thinking could be right for YOU and your play style and bracket. The important part is always thinking bout your actions/ items  / mistakes after each game."
TrueDoTA2,fmgjorp,t3_fv59jm,1586050548.0,"I think QoP is a very versatile hero and her build can change. Dont know what u mean by “magic build” like radiance mjoilner or like an aghs build ?  I think her items and talents even can change depending on the game. 


Null wand treads orchid -> now depending on the game you can build so many different items. If they have a lot of high armor heroes u can get aghs. If they bristle or timber you can get silver edge. If tjey have silencer you can get a euls or bkb. Maybe if theres PL you can get the maelstrom etc. i named only basic scenarios with certain heroes to show my point. It really depends on the enemy heroes and how youre able to play team fights. Some games i have to play really safe because they can blow me up and other games i can blink in more and not die. You should put that into consideration when itemizing as well.

And to finally answer your question directly, yes i think the magic build is viable."
TrueDoTA2,fmep5jn,t1_fmenk3w,1586010275.0,"They dont care about losing the lane because they farm the jungle really fast. So even if the lane goes bad they can still catch up. A lot of other cores can't do this nd rely heavily on the lane. Invading the jungle is really difficult at the moment and stopping WK / naga / tb from farming is also hard to do. So not only are they good if the lane goes poorly, but if the lane goes even or a lead they farm even faster."

TrueDoTA2,fmegq2h,t3_fuqrrm,1586003345.0,"Mid or safe lane are both okay seeing that youre low mmr like u said so it doesnt really matter. 

Dont skill stun just max your acid and greed. Bracer soulring treads (if they have a lot of physical damage get phase). One you get those you build radiance -> abyssal/bkb/blinker depending on the situation but if u dont pick blink then get the other two and dont buy blink after. If you pick blink then get one of the other two after. 

Ignore everyone till u have radiance or radiance +1 item. I cant stress this one enough. So many alch players run to help and die because of it. 

To answer your other question how to farm? Generally just stick to your jungle and always carry tps so u can tp across the map to get a big wave at the tower. U can jungle from lvl 4 and be well off so dont panic if your lane goes bad. Aim for a 17-19 minute radiance which is decent (15 minutes is super fast and attainable). 


Some items to after treads radiance abyssal bkb is AC/bloodthorn/mjoiner. The new bloodthorn is exceptionally good now because it gives attack speed.

PRO TIP: throughout the game remind your team to get bounties. Easy to forget for your team but some how the enemy team always knows to get it vs an alch :) 

Alch is weak early game and its easy to fall behind but he has a huge peek once he gets radiance and can turn a game that looks lost. Good luck :)"

DotA2,fk2kaxc,t1_fk1zk0q,1583802912.0,Well no theres more but if you wanna improve at dota you need to look at the gameplay in chronological order. No point in looking at mid game or late game if you dont play early game well enough. His laning was the first thing that i noticed and thats the first thing he needs to fix. Once his laning is better he can work on his mid game items/movement etc. After that late game. Another reason u should do this is cuz early game is 100% in all the games you play and mid/late game isnt. Theres ofc other shit like what heroes to play or how to play certain heroes but another thing for a herald player is keep the advice precise and dont throw too many things or you end up not learning anything.

DotA2,fk1refm,t1_fk1g9gd,1583785347.0,"The three main heroes i focused on were void antimage and tb because thats what you recently played and safe lane seems like what

1) Your CSing in lane should be #1 priority for you. Drill it in your head that EVERY enemy creep matters. Early game farm is very important on how it impacts the rest of the game. I seen a lot of times where you would go for attacks on the enemy instead of getting the creep kill.

2) Get every CS in lane but Dont auto attack to get them. You want the creep equilibrium to be even. If u auto attack creeps it pushes the wave and a lot goes wrong with this

3) lane creeps > neutral creeps. This is kinda of a grey area but generally before level 5 you shouldnt be jungling. Only time you jungle around lvl5 is because the offlaner might kill u with their 6 or theyre too strong to lane vs. Try to lane as long as possible and send more regen. 

The points you do well is you spend your gold right away for items in the lane and your starting items are also pretty good. Also you choose the correct skills for the heroes. So continue to do these while you work on your CSing in lane."

Minors are okay but my graduated friends and family told me they dont offer much. Common way people get minors is when theyre pursuing a major but switch mid way and they have a minor in their previous major.

Some subjects sometimes are just not fun lol. School is also not for everyone and they just wanna get by and graduate which is thats totally fine.

I also wanted to do something in math or take more math courses but I didn't want to be a math major.

What was the outcome? -Longer time to graduate of course. Also the material being a lot tougher. I would be out of college by now but I'm still slaving away. I knew comp sci was going to be hard but not this much. It also made me hate math. I'm a person that had math as their favorite subject and I pretty much hate it now lol.

Make sure you quest attack exp and prayer xp. Practice edge pking with range to gmaul. Once you get 60 attack and higher stats, practice hybrid pking with budget gear like water staff ghostly dds etc.

Goal is to spend as little gp as possible on gear during your learning phase. Even if money is not an issue still no point. Also practice shark -> kara and practice triple eating with shark brew kara"

CollegeMajors,ff5lysn,t3_erdqoh,1579599442.0,"Aim for something that u think will be worth it even if its difficult. Also theres no “wrong decision.” You make a choice based on what you know and based off others experienced and opinions. So dont feel like theres a wrong choice because after a year you can still change and be doing well. I was in my last year about to finish my business degree but i switched to computer science.  

Ill say go the nursing route. From my experience all my biology friends started to hate biology and i know a lot of people who do nursing now and they dont really complain. And for accounting or finance i wouldnt recommend it because it is boring imo but if u can stand it then it’ll pay well. Im biased cuz i did switch out of business though. Im not totally sure what other major would appeal to u but from the ones you gave i think nursing is best.

Good luck on your decision!"

2007scape,femej84,t3_epxkya,1579251370.0,"Ive had this problem and i want you to think of this every time you stake. There is NO LUCK at the duel arena. Duel arena is also not a money maker. Laugh at what im saying or its stupid but the duel arena is all about odds and math. With the new taxes in the game youre 100% going to lose in the long run staking. You think its 50/50 but the 1% tax makes it LIKE its 49.5/49.5. So both players will slowly lose over time,

Now staying on topic of the long run. You said the instant 10m is better then a week if u played normally right ? But where in the game can you lose 10m that quick (besides pking lol) and the answer is no where. Imagine staking for 1000 hours and doing zulrah/raids/vorkath for 1000 hours. Over at the duel arena you will either fluctuate close to 50/50 or be in the negatives. You might win for a short amount of time, but the longer you stake, the more you’ll lose. But if you play normally slowly you’ll gain that guaranteed money.  

Now another point. You might think “well if i have a big enough cash stack then i can stake low or have a better chance at not getting cleaned.” This is also wrong but to keep it short, sparc mac had 100B cash and is now at 16B. 

So finally the real advice. You cant cold turkey stop staking, but what you can do is make it so minimal it doesnt really affect you negatively and over time itll go away. My advice is to keep staking but only like this. Start doing like zulrah for example and go for toxic trident staff and blowpipe as your first goal. Slowly build up mid level gear you’ll be using . Once you lock in your gear then whenever you wanna go stake, just stake an hour or twos worth of gold from zulrah. This is what worked for me and i was disciplined enough to never touch my zulrah gear if i lost my 2-5mil stack. Eventually i won like 50mil and just bought tons of supplies and new gear and stopped going to the arena. This is what i did to stop myself from staking. I hope it helps you too. Good luck man."

2007scape,fejznvj,t3_epjlaq,1579189465.0,"Learn to do bird houses for your hunter while you play. Its “passive exp” for hunter and try to start it asap. Basically you teleport, empty your four birdhouses and rebuild them and then you go back to what u were doing. It takes like 1 minute to do and you get ~3k hunter exp and you can do this every hour. I got 60 hunter today by doing this for a week daily.

You can also do farming the same way but it gets pricy. You can wait till u have more cash cuz its kinda fast anyway.

Other then what the others wrote, try to find a good money maker so you can supply some early game items / supplies. For example: high hunter for red chins."

The quest cape and achievement diaries should be your super late goals. Quest cape is all the quests complete and the achievement diaries are like different/special perks/rewards you get for doing them. Easy/Medium/Hard/Elite are the levels for them. To finish elite diary tasks you need mostly lvl 90+ skills so youll be a long way from it. If u complete them though some of them give amazing rewards."

college,feadio9,t3_eo50o7,1578947329.0,"If youre good at studying for long hours then you should be able to do this. But tbh, if you’ve never had this schedule before i wouldnt recommend it. Your tests will all get piled onto the same day and thats really bad. If you cant change it then you got no choice. When tests come up dont leave it to the last second to study! Study for at least 3 of then 4-5 days in advance and leave 1-2 classes for 1-2 days before. This also goes with staying on-top of your work because studying becomes easier. You wont need to study as hard if you do all the hws on time.
