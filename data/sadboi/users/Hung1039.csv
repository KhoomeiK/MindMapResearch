I never knew my dads age, his story, what he does, what he loves let alone his point of view on politics or if he was into conspiracy theories.  My mom?  She was always a busy woman since she came over here from the Vietnam war trying to provide for her family and putting me through school to have a good education.  But the saddest part to me is that I’ll never ask my mom her story until she will be on her deathbed.  I only know the few stories or history of my mom by asking my sister on occasion.  Love your parents if you can, because I have tried but I am disconnected also from my mother.  She has my well-being in her mind, but her and I have many different ethics that it will be difficult for us to ask the deep questions until it’s time to go."

I will say though, chemistry 1 and 2 were difficult for me especially chem 1 when the teacher could not teach me and would not help and I had to teach myself.  I’d recommend a tutor because in chem 2 I’d show up to the teacher office hours at 8am and sit there until 10am at least twice a week just doing hwk with her and her going over what I didn’t understand.  Im not sure if you want to do this, but I would confront your teacher about her feelings over you and then like wise for you so that way you both can come to some sort of agreement with what’s wrong and what you need help with.  Some professors are that much more kind when you express what’s going on and communicate your struggles with them versus just moving along and then failing with no understanding of what you could’ve done differently.

Have insecurities because in many societies a male has to be strong and muscular to be worthy of having someone like you on their arms.  And it’s these moments that what you say can only do so much.
