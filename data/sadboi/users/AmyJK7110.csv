If it was me, and I had done quite a bit, I would thread a lifeline in, using an embroidery needle and spare yarn, on the knit side (the v's) pick up the right leg of every stitch, as close to the beginning as possible.  I would then unknit stitch by stitch until I undid all the mistake knitting. If you haven't gotten too far, tink back.  Now, this may totally be the long way of doing things, and some may very well be able just to remove the needles and thread the knitting needle into all those live loops, but that can be scary for some (me sometimes)"

I also had goiters and through ultrasound, it had doubled in size over a very short time period. I actually wish I never had the surgery.  It was a horrible experience for me. I have vocal paresis and dysphonia. So I strongly advise you to seek out all of your options before choosing the thyroidectomy. It is a major surgery."

A hairdryer on the cool setting works well for this and will help it clear up faster and help relieve itching.  You can also try sleeping in loose boxers, or no undies at all as this helps air circulation around the area.  A final note, use a cream, not the sprays that are sold.  A cream will work much better."

He is also anxious about upsetting me, disappointing me, not saying the right thing (what I want to hear)  I feel very guilty that I have essentially made my husband afraid of me.  I am very outspoken and brazen and comfortable sexually.  This scares him and makes his anxiety worse, thus compounding our problem.  It's a hard road but I am learning to accept his awkward compliments and attempts at initiating. It has helped. 
I'm not saying your husband is afraid of you, or that you made him this way, but maybe he has anxiety and counseling will help with that.
As a last comment, if my husband had complimented me by saying ""you looked very elegant tonight ""  I would have accepted that gracefully because I know even if it sounded forced, that it only seemed forced because he felt so awkward trying to find the words to express how he felt."
