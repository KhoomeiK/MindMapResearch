mentalhealth,fpbmcug,t3_gcdan4,1588473357.0,"I do exactly this. 

I haven't talked to pretty much any of my friends for over a month. The more I put off talking to them, the more this anxiety builds up of will they be mad at me the next time I text them. Dealing with arguments, especially in this state, is horrendously mentally draining. So I keep putting it off to avoid this, even though I know that'll only make things worse.

My therapist told me the best thing to do was send a short message to each of them explaining that I'll talk to them at another time when I'm feeling less down, and for them to have patience with me. And if they don't understand, then they're not worth being friends with. In all honesty, I know there's a bigger chance of my closer friends accepting this rather than not, but it's the fear of uncertainty of what they'll say that stops me from talking. Or just the mentally draining part of holding a conversation.

I'd try reaching out to them when you feel ready to, even if it's just a quick message. As for your boyfriend, talk to him about how you're feeling. Him and your friends are there for you to talk about these things, even if it may seem like an extra inconvenience for them, it's not. And if they decide that they don't want to help you because of this, they're not worth it.

Apart from that, I hope things get better for you and I'm open to DM if you need to talk. :)"

She almost seemed angry at first and I barely slept that night thinking about what she'd say in the morning. 

But we ended up just talking through everything and I'm honestly really glad that I got that opportunity to talk to her. It meant that I could ask her for help later on, or ask to see a counselor etc, and her being more understanding.

Like my mum, I'm sure the initial reaction with yours is just because it was unexpected. But at the end of the day she is your mum and she'll love you no matter what. She cares for you and just wants to support you through these harder times."
