My sister, at 37, dead-ass got asked by the hairdresser if she was ‘excited for graduating highschool.’

I’m 28.

This one was really weird though. I was out with my aforementioned ten-year-older sister and I was mistaken for her MOTHER. So her baby-face is stronger than mine haha."

Haha, it shouldn't take hours!  It's not very involed for me because either I just used some pre-packaged pancake mix, or flour with vanilla sugar and a tad of baking soda. I don't even measure anything out, just eyeball the batter. It should be pretty thick, then on a medium heat. But to be completely honest I've been practising my pancake skills for years because I want to be a pancake queen (the Netherlands is pretty pancake obsessed, we usually make flat ones though) and I also have a special pan for pancakes. Banana pancakes in particular are quite forgiving because the banana makes it so nice!"

learndutch,fozgs9u,t3_gafisf,1588190404.0,"‘bezweken’ is the same as ‘succumbed to’
‘overleden’ would be the equivalent of ‘passed away’
‘gestorven’ (not gestErven) would be ‘died’

Sterven is the most crude/least sensitive. You could say ‘sterf, klootzak’ or use it figuratively ‘ik sterf van de honger’. Still, it is not unlikely for gestorven to be used in the same way as overleden sometimes.

By the way, bedoelen means ‘mean’ as in ‘she meant you, not him’ or ‘what do you mean?’ while betekenen means ‘mean’ as in ‘this word means’"
