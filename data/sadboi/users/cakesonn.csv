AskReddit,fqqumc7,t3_gkd5qm,1589572247.0,"I‚Äôll say mine since everyone in my opinion is just saying starters 

I also have two though : dragonite and darmanitan ( i guess even his pre evolution darumaka ) 

dragonite I‚Äôve always loved his powerful but cute look and seemed to fit my personality type, and once I caught one in Pok√©mon go and named him ramen i make it a point to find and catch a dratini, it‚Äôs always really funny that he goes from a slick blue snake dragon to a huge tubby orange derp machine, just so much love for dragonite

As for darmanitan I caught a darumaka in black and white 2 (my first real pokemon experience) and he was just so op and when he turned into darmanitan I was so in love, he want from cute and useful to a tuff power house bad ass, I basically only used him in my run and beat almost every single trainer with him (even if they had the type advantage) 

so gg to my 2 main men"
