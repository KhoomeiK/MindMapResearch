It's hard because therapy/medications you took gave you directions where to move forward.

Therapy is usually aimed at high goals and in the meantime small ones isn't a thing going through process. I'm med student myself and I tried to learn everything possible about mental health because my best friend is heavily depressed for 2 years and it probably helped me to stay away from taking any horrible actions against myself. 

I am crazy but I do have more knowledge than enough to learn from it. I could be a therapist myself so I don't really feel like it would help me.

Let's say that I'm doing half of the tasks alone and my 6 colleagues are doing the rest because they're slower than me.

Last week my manager organized 1to1 meeting with me and he asked to write written explanation why I was late at that day. There are many details and we argued about it for a week and I won it. I decided to screw him up by decreasing my own productivity so our shift always would miss cut-offs.

Also, in written explanation I told them that I'm bipolar and no matter what they would to against my will  (to kick me out for example)  I may get them to the court and I would win it.

I was like fella with my manager as well but that argument we did caused hypomania even though I was stable from bipolar for 3 weeks.

I wasn't fighting my bipolar because I'm great at hiding it. Yes, I do crash and sometimes badly but I'm doing everything possible to get of these symptoms ASAP.

My own experience as Bipolar II; 

Depressive) I sleep for 10-15 hours a day. I have no energy to do anything, alarms won't work on me. I used to skip every class for months because I couldn't move my negative thoughts out of my head. I would avoid people, barely talk with them. Anxiety, panic attacks filled the whole space when I wasn't fighting back. And then when I lose control over it - I don't see any point why I should study, work, talk, eat. At the end of that I would only play video games just to stay awake because otherwise I may sleep for 20 hours a day. Duration: from 4 days to 1 month. 

What I managed to find out that caffeine and nicotine helps to me stay awake.

\- They're both helping me with Dopamine and Noradrenal, Adrenal. 

\- Becoming angry at something. Like really badly helps me to get angry-depression which is similar to Major Depression but still I'm at least capable of doing things that are necessary.

\- Talking with people that  I can really trust helps me out to regain small amounts of confidence. I just can't be around of people that I cannot trust at that time due to slight paranoia.

&#x200B;

Normal) Pretty much sweet side of me. Intelligent, funny. I'm extrovert so I can feed myself up with energy by talking with them, discussing. Right then I love to go outside, enjoy nature and stuff.

Hypomania) Well, hypomania is the same as typical one but the main different aspect of my hypomania is that I can be really creative at making some projects, even making music etc."

I'm battling Bipolar for nearly 4 years (without taking any medications) and when depression hits I can barely do anything. The worst thing is that it disappears and it comes back randomly but sometimes I may get trigger by stressful events. And guess what? I'm fully capable of hiding it.

There is no such thing as giving up. If you're feeling worthless you need to find a reason why and how you may solve it. Do you have any pets? Get one. Are you doing any sports? Start it. I'm a fucking cripple who can't run more than 2 kilometers due to knee injury and guess what? It hurts but that's how I receive energy to fight.

For example, sometimes I feel like I want to cheer someone up and I make a quick plan how to do that depending on a person. If it works - I'm feeling happy.

She's obviously Bipolar. And you helped her to enter Mania even though she was in hypomania at first. She needs hospitalization for at least 2 weeks to calm her down otherwise it will stop only when she won't have any pennies left.

I had a hypomanic episode last month. At first I was feeling well and then I started to multitasking randomly, even at the work place. I could do many things at the same time and everything was working really well until I got 1to1 with my team leader who wasn't happy that I was late to arrive in time for a week or something.

He tried to explain things nicely but I made a freaking huge argument and insulted him many times non-directly (pretty much exploiting each of his weakness as team leader) and then I understood that I've reached mania by having that dialogue. I was in this mood for a week and I've read about 10000 pages of scientific information about evolution, history, politics, genetics etc. without having any reason for that. I could insult and tell everything whatever I feel at that moment. I did a couple of debates with my colleagues and family members about craziest things ever. Finally, I understood that it's getting worse each minute, so I decided to withdraw from these conversations for good.

It took me about 3 weeks to escape mania/hypomania episodes but slowly I felt how I'm getting into depression.

You need to calm her down somehow, otherwise she will jump into biggest depression of her life. The higher she goes up, the lower she falls. That's the key thing with bipolar.

I don't know what is your occupation and what not but you should seek for changes. Changing a job or pushing your boss for promotion could be a solution. You must settle new goals. If you don't have a lover or people to talk with use Tinder etc. You're not feeling bad 100% at the times.

You're different than me. You can make friends, feel and emotionally attach to another person. Look for activities in your city. Basketball, Tennis, Football etc. Also, don't try to use alcohol while you're being sad. You will definitely get worse. Read a book instead even if it sounds dumb. 

Most importantly, start making notes. It probably would help you to plan things way better and it could reduce fails at certain level to minimum."

You shouldn't give a single fuck about your family. In this case scenario you need to consider and solve your own problems instead of worrying for a such humanistic thing. I suggest to make a great explanation for them why you're doing this. Make it emotional and they will take it way easier."

I do have anxiety, depression and rarely mania. I'm sociopath that no one likes or loves and the only one reason I do have some people around me was my charming personality that I put on stage not to feel lonely.

In depression episode I'm feeling in pretty much the same way. I remember driving a car right before my night shift. I smoked a cigarette in the gas station just before crossing a forest. That cigarette saved my life. I hit a deer in a middle of the forest and the only one reason that I'm still alive is a fucking cigarette that helped me to pay attention on the road. I managed to switch steering wheel at the very last second but hit still happened. Was I happy because I survived? No. Would I be happy if I die? Answer is the same.

Also, If you believe that I made this story up I can send you a photo of my car after an accident."
