CatholicWomen,fp3ji42,t3_gax7bo,1588280390.0,"That was painful to read. First of all I am so sorry you are going through this. INCLUDING the fertility struggles that you had...I have so many questions I wish I could ask. Was this friend there for you when you and your husband were struggling to have a baby in the past??!! Did she comfort you when you were having mood swings due to how intense clomid is? Did she ever apologize or show and humility with ways she possibly could have hurt you? 
I guess it seems like this gal made you her personal punching bag. She doesn’t seem very stable herself, especially when you have clearly let your actions speak louder than words yet she always seems to find a way to tear you down or make you feel like you just haven’t quite “done enough” for her. This might be due to me making an assumption or misunderstanding the overall “tone” of what you have written, but she doesn’t sound like a very healthy friend to have. That is not friendship. Friendship forgives AND eventually forgets. Friendship that is based on Christ bears fruit too. Sure things aren’t perfect, but it seems as if you’re the one always apologizing and trying to “not screw up” yet she’s the one who is always perfect...? No way. 
Again, I don’t know you guys or how your friendship has played out, but based on what you’ve shared, she sounds very broken all while displacing and projecting her insecurities and pain onto you. Personally, I don’t know if I would hold onto a friendship like that. Sometimes history isn’t enough to keep people together. 
Also, what effort has she made to reconnect? Has she continually pushed you away or blown you off in cold and passive aggressive ways (one word responses, taking days to respond to you, etc). 
Maybe it’s time she steps up and see’s what a wonderful friend you’ve been to her? Maybe she will realize it, but seems like she is taking advantage of your charity and compassion.

Edit: 
I also know how it feels to try to reach out to someone you have considered practically your only family for 10+ years. Sometimes you hold onto that relationship even if it’s unhealthy just because it’s the only thing you have. Better to be alone than continually getting rejected by a very insecure and bitter person who is using you as a scapegoat for their own issues."

Catholicism,fo475ef,t3_g5imfm,1587499345.0,"I’ve thought about and discussed this quite a lot recently. It’s almost worse that these self proclaimed atheists have lukewarm/misguided experiences or displays of so called “Christianity” rather than if they simply had no clue what Catholicism or Jesus even was. People have had such weird or negative encounters with some “oppressive” thing called religion aka Christianity that they just make a blanket assumption about the whole thing. When I point this out to the uneducated atheists they never truly know how to answer that and/or agree with me if they are honest with themselves. Also majority of atheists I’ve been around are just straight up ignorant. They have no clue about the Bible, the catechism, the foundations of the church, etc. I usually ask something along the lines of, “how can you hate something you’ve never genuinely taken the time to learn about?” Always something worth pondering even with other things in life."
keto,fo3qjjo,t3_g5ck1s,1587491313.0,"First off, THANK YOU for sacrificing so much and for all you do to help save lives, even that rude lady! When it comes to losing weight, it’s always a battle, but when you start off small it’s shocking how much can be done. I am in the same boat as you and losing weight has been one of the hardest things I’ve had to do in terms of personal changes in my habits/health. I told myself on the first day I chose to not just be “skinny” or “look good” but to be HEALTHY! I was sick and tired of feeling tired, having no energy, shooting myself in the foot every time I said no to self-control. It was the same cycle of success then failure, so instead I decided to do one little “healthy” thing each day. I started walking, just one mile. That’s it. Try to eat healthy throughout the day and walk. Slowly I started jogging on and off, cut out some more things from my diet (all fast food, candy, and beer) one day at a time. Soon enough I looked back after keeping this up for 2 months and turns out I had lost 15 lbs with those small changes. I also started congratulating myself on all the progress and things I DID do well! I would always tell myself after a workout or whatever it was “oh you didn’t walk fast enough”, or “you probably didn’t lose enough calories, what a waste”. I stopped that. I shut those thoughts down cold turkey and kept up the self-affirmation. I still have days where I’d rather just stay in, grab a nice cool beer and snack on something I know I’ll regret...but that doesn’t help me feel any more happy or fulfilled at the end of the day. Just not worth it anymore. 
I hope to continue this and keep losing the weight I need. I always tell my friends, “if I can do this then so can you!” And I mean it! I’ll say the same to you and anyone else who reads this. Good luck to you and keep up the amazing work. You got this!!"

There were a couple of other guys who ended up joining the posse too since it was open. They were also low levels, I think all under 20. It felt super good to help out and get the priceless reactions lol. 
Some people tried jumping them too while I was in a shop, and boy was it awesome being able to come out, guns blazing to defend them from random griefers.

I was in sports my entire life, could run a 7:30ish mile no problem. Now I’m about 25 and weighed 153 lbs this past December. Since then I said “screw it” and started eating healthier and actually working out 3-4x a week. About 3 months later I now weigh 140 lbs and have never been happier. I still would like to lose another 5 pounds and tone up a tad bit more, but slow and steady wins the race! 

It’s worth it getting back into shape. Plus setting the physical goals for yourself is such a amazing feeling when you finally accomplish them.
Starting off I could barely do 5, maybe 10 push ups, now I can do 20 easily. I also had a 10:30 mile, and so far I’m down to about 8:30. Still not ideal but also a great way to give myself some affirmation and motivation to continue taking charge of my physical health.

After that I’m done!” 
That’s almost as bad as using birth control. NFP is a discernment process the entire way. If you and your husband feel you are truly being open to life yet do not feel called to add another BLESSING to the family, then so be it.

Started when my parents were getting divorced my mom took my to a psychologist, priest, and then a doctor only for none of it to work other than just learning to channel my stress and anxiety into other things (technically getting spiritual counsel on it helped though, prayer is key to help reduce the physical anxiety spells). 

For instance I would wake up in the middle of the night and feel like I was going to vomit. My stomach would be all tense and I’d be shaking like I was gonna freeze to death. I’d be shivering frantically too. Sad thing is I’ve had this my whole life now. When things are super stressful guess what comes back? THE WEIRD STOMACH PAIN/FAKE STOMACH FLU!! Ughhh!! 

Also part of it recently is when I have a few glasses of wine it makes it worse, which I think is another issue related to acid reflux making me nauseas. Besides the point, I just do things that I know relax me and take my mind off the pain/feeling of puking. Get up and just walk around. Do something to get your heart pumping and blood flowing. It’s the just sitting and waiting for the feeling to pass that makes it worse sometimes too. Another weird thing that works is clenching and flexing different parts of my body. Intentionally forcing myself to focus on another area and feel it even more! 

Idk if any of that helped or makes any sense but hopefully you have a better idea of some other things to try. A heating pad can also help too sometimes."

Fitness,f9iddu1,t3_e4y2jk,1575334339.0,"I was just thinking I should get back into working out and this post showed up on my feed...dang, my lazy potato sack self needs to start exercising. I just don’t have energy to start, but once I do regularly work out I’m fine. It’s the beginning part of getting back into shape that kills my motivation."

socialskills,f9ictgf,t1_f9gkvpr,1575333928.0,"TRUTH right here! I went through a similar experience actually and once I started accepting most people usually don’t make the first step to invite someone to coffee or something, I was able to let my guard down and let go of my fear of rejection! I actually have a couple of good friends now because of me just saying “screw it” and making that first step. It’s worth it compared to being down in the dumps and not having any authentic/close relationship!"
