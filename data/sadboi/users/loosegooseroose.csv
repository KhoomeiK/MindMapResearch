ADHD,fndh2fs,t3_g0wpo0,1586869826.0,"Alternatively, can we attribute our perceptions of idiosyncrasies as symptoms of ADHD, to our ADHD?
/s

In all seriousness, I’ve definitely found myself falling into that pattern- I’ll notice my own idiosyncrasies, and as I realize that my neurotypical friends/family don’t display the same behaviors/patterns, I think about mine in the context of my ADHD. Then I wonder if anyone else with ADHD relates to the experience and share it on here or find that someone else has already shared it on here. I think OP has a valid point, but I also think a lot of those posts aren’t necessarily trying to depict specific idiosyncrasies as characteristic of ADHD specifically. Rather, I think that sometimes, when we notice our own unique behaviors and realize that the neurotypicals around us don’t share comparable or similar experiences, we turn to this subreddit. Sometimes we absolutely fall into the trap of mistakenly assuming that “XYZ behavior is a symptom of ADHD,” but other times I feel like we also recognize that our experiences might be more relatable for other non-neurotypicals than for neurotypicals, and that’s why so many “does anyone else also do XYZ” posts here."

mentalhealth,fmi51fr,t3_fv5y5j,1586102568.0,"Holy shit this describes me perfectly. When I was in elementary and middle school I was more comfortable talking to adults than people in my age group. I was always told that it was a reflection of my intelligence- I wasn’t afraid or nervous about talking with people who were smarter than me because I could learn from them. I was always trying to grow up as quickly as possible and couldn’t wait to be an adult. But when I focused on growing up, I never really knew how to be a kid, or at least never really appreciated what it meant to be a kid, and that’s something that I can never get back. Was diagnosed with ADHD at 22 and for a while it didn’t make sense because its perceived as something that impacts kids and then they grow out of it. But I was always so comfortable around adults and good in school that it never seemed like something that affected me, until college came around and everything in my life felt like it was collapsing at once and I couldn’t even focus enough to pass my classes without draining myself emotionally, physically and mentally. I was so excited to be an adult and then when I had to be an adult I wanted nothing more than to be a kid again. I basically went from being an adult trapped in a kid’s world to being a kid trapped in adult’s world. Since the diagnosis, treatment has helped me assimilate to adult life, but assimilation into adulthood doesn’t mean my desire to experience life through the curious and fearless lens of a child is gone. Hope that makes sense 😅"

FIFA,f5x4q9t,t3_dpofax,1572535359.0,"TL;DR Change your tactics to fit your style of play or to counter your opponents tactics. Attacking width and attacking style can have an immediate and noticeable impact. Same with defensive with and style.

Adjust your attacking width. If you’re players feel too spread out and wide, decrease your width and play the ball to the middle. If you’re players feel too narrow and central, increase width and use the wings to get forward. 

Play around with different attacking styles, too. If you’re set to possession, you won’t have much success trying to move the ball forward right when you get possession. But lateral passing and back-passing with your CDMs/CMs and your CBs/LB/RB usually generate better off-ball movement from AI teammates. 

If you want more forward passing options, try fast build up. You’ll have more passing options up the pitch, but a good press can cut those lanes if you get too aggressive, leaving you screwed by a quick counter. 

Long Ball sends your strikers deep but still gives you flexibility in the midfield. Less aggressive than fast buildup but less risky as well.

Balanced attack, to me, seems to limit off-ball movement unless the opponent is committing to a press and leaves gaps for your forwards to fill. If the opponent drops back and gives you space, your teammates are more likely to offer support. 

If you’re struggling to dribble around defenders or your players are constantly getting the ball stolen from their feet, try shielding the ball to either draw more fouls or preserve possession. It makes it easier for the defender to physically closer to the ball but by encouraging him to challenge you can open up space and call for a support run from a teammate for a safe, short pass.

If you’re losing possession to interceptions but not challenges, try spreading out to create space for you to dribble and waiting to pass till a defender commits or is pulled out of position. 

Defensively, I prefer to use the “Balanced” tactic and set my width to 4 bars, and I only ever change the width when I feel like I’m getting killed.

Sorry for the long answer, but these are some of the ways I’ve been able to avoid getting absolutely dominated. There’s no universal solution, but learning how the different tactics mechanics work in different situations can help you know when to change it up and which way to change it up. Ive gotten to the point where in the first 10-15 minutes of a match I’ll know if I need to change anything and what changes I should make."

ADHD,eovujpa,t3_bt8qup,1558900882.0,"I’ve felt the same way over the last 3 or 4 years, which really bothered me because as a kid, I always found value even in the cheesiest and most cliche motivational speeches, but more exposure to the “real world” basically shattered my idealism. For a while it felt like I had lost myself because my idealism and ambition were huge parts of who I was and without them I felt like I was missing a part of me.

After getting tired of “going through the motions,” I willingly read a book for the first time in years that genuinely reignited my idealism. The book is called “Stealing Fire” by Steven Kotler Jamie Wheal, and its roughly 270 pages, I believe. Typically I can’t read a book over 100 pages, but I managed to finish this one in about 5 days because it felt incredibly engaging. 

The book focuses on connecting more with your inner self and channeling your creativity and ambition in a meaningful and fulfilling way. It’s definitely not your standard motivational book, and it covers the most taboo of topics, but it really helped me find more meaning in life. I don’t want to guarantee that it’s going to work for everyone, but I do think it’s worth a read. If you find yourself still interested after the first few chapters, then you’ll probably like the whole thing. If not, then that’s totally fine and you can drop it for something that suits you better. I know reading isn’t really fun most of the time, but there’s also an audiobook on kindle app so you can listen to it on your phone instead of reading. Hope it helps :)"

Also, a lot of my dreams end up becoming my reality. Dreams about student council elections, football games, cross country race times etc. often occurred almost exactly the same way in real life after the dreams."
