AskReddit,fq9oa6w,t3_ghn7ch,1589203483.0,"She told me that I wasn't fat when a concerned friend's parent informed her of my eating disorder at nine years of age...just lazy and undisciplined. That looks meant nothing, anyway, and that brains were more important... then told me for years to follow that I was stupid, fat and lazy. 

After multiple panic attacks and psych interventions as a teenager, she told me to that I could feel any way that I wanted to, and to get over my immense feelings of emptiness and depression, and to just ""feel better"".

Also, that no one liked a sad girl or mad girl, when I was a young mother. That I should be grateful and stop crying. That every red flag was to be hidden, ashamed of. That madness could simply be squashed, and suicidal thoughts were nonsense, attention seeking, wrong.

That if I didn't learn how to control my thoughts and feelings better that I would be locked away... by which point my BPD and CPTSD had become so severe I had developed a full blown psychosis at the time.... nine days of psych ward treatment later when I remembered my name again, she told me to stop being silly and come home. 

I love her, and always will.... but she was wrong. A lot."
