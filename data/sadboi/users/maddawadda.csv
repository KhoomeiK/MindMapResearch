In DR I’ve never seen a thrift store and used clothes are usually donations coming from like America. Maybe some exist but all the times I’ve visited family there I have never seen one nor has anyone mentioned one.

Dogs, like Chloe, do not. They have one job, which is to make us feel loved. Dogs are good at that. So are cockatoos, I guess.
