BipolarReddit,fr4pdyd,t3_gm3rzk,1589894101.0,It‚Äôs not enough to fix us and will cost you a lot of money each month.  I started this past January trying to use weed to help and now I almost spend 400 500 a month on weed.  It‚Äôs helped but only for a hour or two and then I would have to smoke again.  I started new meds and my doctor said weed can make things worse and make out lows and highs much much worse.  I haven‚Äôt quit yet but I want too.

It helps in the moment and then I go change mania and depression moods extremely quick. Like I can feel myself changing moods. I‚Äôm sure you know what I mean. How do you cope or help with it.  Alcohol also makes it so much worse.

Not saying to not talk to them but it takes time.  You have to be the person who reaches out and get help. Don‚Äôt rely on others do reach out for you.   Do some research.  Start writing down what‚Äôs wrong and why you feel you can fix it.  I‚Äôm 27 male and I‚Äôm still on this battle everyday.  This year is the year I started looking for help.
