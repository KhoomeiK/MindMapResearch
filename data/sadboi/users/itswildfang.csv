This is what I've found from the ACAS (UK) website. 

I work as an engineer for a company whose clients business is classed as front-line workers. The buildings will be full occupied as normal, and that means we are classed as key-workers so they want me back in. 

I'll be using this as an escape route from putting myself in harm's way.

Hope this helps anyone out. I know it's UK guidance but there has been very little given by the Gov't and NHS with clarity that can back you up with regard to work rights."

I noticed in the CWC final, the movement of players in-between frames was quite a distance when the ref went to the video monitor to review the foul on Mane.

Things like the fact it's eau de toilette (which is weaker) or eau de parfum (which is stronger), how the aftershave and deodorant combine, how clean your clothes are (if your house is dusty they will attract bad smells and your scent won't be able to break through), how recently you've washed, what environment you've been in since you washed...all things that can effect the general scent of a person. 

Don't forget, the person who smells good will probably not be able to smell themselves anyway and won't think they smell as strongly as they do due to the fact that your nose gets used to consistent smells and kind of phases them out. If you use the same scents on yourself every day then you won't be able to pick up on it as easy."

drums,f8gkkge,t3_e0rvab,1574561114.0,"The way I did it was to aim for medium level stuff. If you're gigging especially. The sound quality is fairly large. Can you listen to samples on the cymbal makers websites (or YouTube) for comparison? The beginners stuff is usually pressed as it is cheaper to produce, but medium level onward is usually cast, meaning they're poured into moulds and are usually more hard wearing. You get what you pay for, so if you're buying crap, you'll buy crap twice for what you pay for once with better gear. Maybe try a cymbal box set or barely used medium priced stuff. 
With second hand cymbals look out for cracks, keyholes around where it's mounted and try and get a feel for what kind of drummer you're buying from. I've bought some great second hand gear, but I've also bought crap when I've been naive. Do your research and find what best suits you and your style. There are no wrong answers. Hope this helps in any way."
