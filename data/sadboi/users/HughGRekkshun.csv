But, I started using anti depressants at 16. I’m 26 now. Started smoking weed heavily at around 22. I can wholeheartedly say, that weed has absolutely changed my life for the better in all ways. When I was sober from it, and just taking antidepressants, I just wanted to kill myself and not exist every day I woke up. I hated every absolute thing about myself and hated being here. But I can proudly say I don’t take anti depressants anymore and I just use cannabis in a respectful way to medicate my awful existential major depressive disorder. My point is, everyone is different and unfortunately not everyone gets a benefit from it. But for me, it’s given me my meaning of life back and a sense of happiness and purpose. I can definitely say that the long term effects and short term effects of anti depressants and anti anxiety meds are wayyyy worse compared to cannabis. I used to take OxyContin for my spinal stenosis and Xanax for my anxiety. I literally thought I was going to die when coming off those. When I stopped weed for a bit, yeah I was irritable and an asshole, but the physiological withdrawal symptoms were a walk in the park compared to my pharmaceutical meds."
