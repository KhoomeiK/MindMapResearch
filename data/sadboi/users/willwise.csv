What I was trying to say is the traffic and the construction and the stress of the French quarter and even just getting across the bridge was too much for me so I ended up staying in Gretna for many reasons that I am trying to decide if I want to get into right now. I would have only gone over to the French quarter in order to busk but after asking around I found out that I was way beyond my musical abilities and I needed to just stay at my vacation rental and practice and study music before ever go tried to hang with those Buskers. so I stayed in Gretna, got to know the neighborhood, found some awesome food at gas stations and little hole-in-the-wall places and sat at the Gretna ferry landing that was even shut down for some reason so it was empty and I just stared at the river and watched the ships roll in and even saw one or two alligators at night!

So yeah ironically that was my New Orleans vacation! I definitely had a good time and can't wait to get back and cross that River and actually hang with the buskers and get in the mix."

My dad is driving and we have his dog magic. so I'm not vagabonding at all this was the first Sub I thought of about busking in New Orleans now that I think of it I should have looked up a busking subreddit. 

The traffic was bad on the other side and a couple of ferries were even shut down so I gave up on getting across plus realized I needed more practice and studying before I can go try to hang the real Buskers in French quarter. I asked a few people who have busked before and they gave me some advice like the different levels of buskers and where they are and how territorial it is and in hindsight I would have been foolish to just a walk up and think I could just start jamming along.

So just bad timing between me and you. I plan on coming back to New Orleans specifically at this rental in Gretna after this coming Mardi gras so that first weekend after I'll be in town if you are too.

And the bums in this town!

And the traffic!

And the scooters!"
Coffee,ev997y7,t1_ev91ixf,1564312796.0,James Hoffman technique is my favorite and I actually discovered it on my own by experimenting and making ignorant mistakes before I found his video. In fact I usually make a cowboy coffee brew the same way just without the French press. It works great while traveling because I can make it anywhere. I only need hot water and coffee.
rheumatoid,ev65gm6,t3_cifjlu,1564242772.0,"I had to give up exercise, stretching,  water therapy and swimming, even yoga about 10 years ago.  

Anything routine would just ruin my body after about a week or two. I was in the same condition as you, totally debilitated and in fact my abilities were slowly decreasing over a year or two until I became more crippled. I could barely walk a block and get out of bed and go to work and Missed many days of work. I almost had to go on disability but thankfully I stopped the physical therapy because I knew it wasn't working and slowly but surely I started to get better by just simply avoiding it. 

I definitely stay active because I'm actually diagnosed attention deficit hyperactive disorder so that's just my natural impulse. now I am on disability thankfully and I'm able to rest every day and get in a little exercise if I feel okay. I'm very slowly getting better but it will probably take a few years to really notice any difference.

I couldn't find any medicine that help me 10 years ago so I gave up on that also. I am thinking about trying physical therapy and medicine again at least. I have had severe arthritis since age 11 and I am 42 now.

I only take cannabis now and recommend it to everyone. It helps at least. With pain, appetite, insomnia, anxiety - many things really.

 I'm using voice dictation so this is pretty long-winded.  Good luck on your medical journey!"
