I've phone banked for Shahid Buttar and Lauren Ashcraft, who aren't really socialists, but are a much better alternative than the corporate democrats we have now. You can also talk to your friends and family about your political beliefs if you feel comfortable about it. I know a lot of people around our age equate socialism to the gulags in the USSR, ""the government does stuff"", etc so there's a lot of misinformation out there. If you do get enough people to become socialists or even progressive you could even start a club at your school if they allow it and go from there."

SandersForPresident,fj83pdk,t3_fc2b4b,1583104458.0,"1) Bernie isn't a socialist, the media/establishment just puts the ""socialist"" label on everything that would be pro-worker anti-corporation. They called Obama a socialist too. 

2) Why does it matter whether or not another ""old white man"" wins? Does it really matter if Bernie is an ""old white man"" if he's been fighting for the people, whether they be White, Black, Hispanic, Asian-American, Native-American, LGBTQ+, etc, for his whole life? 

3) No that's not true. Medicare For All will be funded by a 4% increase in taxes. However, as long as you make under 300-400k I believe you will be saving money. The average American makes around 45k a year and spends around 10-11k on healthcare I believe. With Medicare for all, they would be paying 1800 in taxes vs  10-11k with the current system we have now. Also, Medicare for all studies have found that Medicare for all saves money since you're getting rid of the insurance companies or the middlemen."
