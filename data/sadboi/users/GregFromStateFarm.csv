It really only worked for the baby boomers, because there was an event that caused all of their births. With other generations, especially newer ones, there is a lot of gray area. Gen Z raised in low-income households have more in common with Millennials than with “their own” generation. I’m 20, but I remember not having a computer for years. My first game console was a Super Nintendo, then an N64, then PS1, etc. I still remember having to plug the computer into the phone jack and waiting 5 minutes to load Google. I still have dozens of old VCR movies. I didn’t get a smartphone until maybe 3-4 years ago. I am the youngest of 5 kids, by as much as 20 years, which is another big factor besides income. Youngest children relate more with previous generations than an oldest child of the same agr. But, because of arbitrary boundaries for my generation, I’m anywhere from the first of Gen Z to the last of Millennials (1999). It just doesn’t work that way in reality."
