I considered the one you mentioned, but ultimately didnt go with it because there are a ton of reviews online that indicate it either doesnt work or doesnt work well. In fact, most machines at that price range seem to have that issue.

If you dont mind printing parts for it and assembling yourself, check out the [MPCNC](https://www.v1engineering.com/specifications/). This has some pretty decent reviews, and is on the cheap side. However, I ultimately didnt go with that option because I am currently using my printer for another project and didnt want to put off being able to use my CNC.

I ultimately went with the E3 by [bob's cnc](https://www.bobscnc.com/). It has about the same work space as the 3018 (a bit bigger) but is much more expensive. It comes as a kit, so you still have to do some assembly (and it does take a while) but so far I am loving the machine. That said, I have only used it with wood and dont really have plans to move to aluminum, though I might. who knows.

edit: i notice on bob's site that the e3 is no longer available. seems they sold the last of the old version and updated to the evolution 3, which is slightly more expensive that the e3 was but seems to be bigger/sturdier."

The model that I use is the [kabbalistic tree of life](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/kabbalah-tree-of-life-zapista-zapista.jpg) (or thats what i started with, I use a different one that I made, but that was the end result of years of pathworking and is basically just a personal update based on my notes and experiences). I recommend that model because it is tied to western occultism pretty heavily and by understanding it you also gain a very detailed understanding of tarot and astrology.

Once you have the model, most people work from one end to the other spending time in meditation and ritual contemplating each step along the way until they feel as though they have an innate understanding of it.

if you'd like, I can work to help you put something together that is specific to the greek pantheon, but right now I am still at work so it's a little difficult to go into more detail at the current moment. feel free to send me a PM.

A good way to do this is through exploring astrology, tarot, or a similar divination system alongside meditation/ritual. More or less using the divination as a way to ascertain direct ""prompts"" if you will and then exploring those in depth.

I'd also recommend reading EVERYTHING you can on the true HISTORICAL practices used in by clergy of your chosen pantheon/dieties and reproducing them as close as you are able. This is something that MANY (not all) modern pagans neglect and is, imo, kinda embarrassing."
