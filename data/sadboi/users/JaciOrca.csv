Have you been given reasons that your applications to adopt are denied?

I‚Äôm curious. I was extremely worried about being denied because of my lack of experience, having no yard, and living in a very small apt.

I live in a small apt. No yard. I filled out applications and was honest about my situation: no experience, my living space, and my work hours. 
But I was also honest in my plan to immediately get a trainer since I had not owned a dog. 3 shelters approved my application. I even had a home visit from one rescue. 
I ended up choosing a 9 week old feral puppy who had been rescued by a local rescue. Adoption finalized June 16. He was rescued from a very rural area along with his emaciated mother and 7 litter mates at age 6 weeks old. 

After adopting, I got a dog trainer and had my pup DNA tested to find out his mix. That was exciting. 

I volunteered and was approved to foster his mother in August with every intent to only foster her for 30 days. Fail. I ended up adopting her at the end of the 30 day foster period. 

It‚Äôs March 2020, Archer is now 10 months old. The first few months were rough. House training, the biting, he still tears up shit when he isn‚Äôt carefully watched despite having lots of toys üòÇ
