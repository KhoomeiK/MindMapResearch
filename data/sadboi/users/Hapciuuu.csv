And no matter how much your family calls your religion foreign, that doesn't make what happened false.

Christians believe in God not because of race and traditions , they believe in Him because He is real. You are right. Jesus wasn't born as a white man and the images we have of him aren't correct.

Christianity,eymbe59,t3_cxjrjo,1567204372.0,"If God isn't real ( I hope He is) than imo christianity is a waste of time. Why serve noone when I can serve myself? With God out of the picture the most important person in the whole universe would be me . Why? Because it makes sense (for me at least) . Only through Me I can sense, think and experience this reality . Without Me the whole universe won't value shit. Why? Because there was no I to give value to it . 

And even if there were other conscious beings , their existence will be pointless because there was no I to know of it and give it value. By this logic I am importance incarnate and others are expendable.


Without God good and evil become subjective. Yes I am very self centered, but the bible taught me about humility.
I am a bad person. But Christ asks me to be a better man. Without Chrit I wouldn't try to be a better man. I try to serve Christ because I hope he is real. If I knew Christ isn't real (not saying he isn't) then I wouldn't follow his teachings or spread the word. 

What I am trying to say is that without God (or an universal order) there is no good and evil. Thus someone can't be better off believing in God if God doesn't exist. Because there's not a better or worse way of living ( depending on your perception). A drug addict, a boxer and a philosopher are all damned to nothingness imo if God isn't real. There is not a better way to be damned. These are all my subjective thoughts on the subject. 

Even the bible regards those who believe in false gods as fouls. I want to be saved but I don't think I am worthy of salvation. I try to serve Christ because I think He deserves to be served. I hope I didn't believe in a lie till now. 

Aww man you made me stay late. I need some sleep. I hope I wake up next morning."
