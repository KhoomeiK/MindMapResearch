It was just a level of disfigurement/disability you simply don’t see in the western world. And then when we got in the car we hired, I was shocked by the traffic going every which way, babies riding on the back of mopeds, and just the overall poverty.

You say it feels high school and you don’t want to cause drama. Well, the way to bring all drama to a screeching halt is to fully cut this woman out of your life and have an expectation that your husband do the same. If your husband sees this boundary as “controlling,” that’s a red flag.

Well, after him running away like 10 times, my parents just let them keep him lol. They simply didn’t go get him, and the neighbors never said anything (but my parents visually confirmed he was there). He was a handful and had a lot of troublesome behavioral problems, and my parents had two young kids to deal with, so it was just for the best.

relationships,fptepiu,t1_fpt9k30,1588889890.0,"I think that is a separate point from the one I’m making. It is one thing to begin discussing a future with your partner (which is what OP is doing), and it’s an entirely different thing to go telling your kids about this future. We don’t know what OP is/is not telling her child about her relationship with her girlfriend. We also don’t know how quickly they intend to progress. While me and my husband discussed a future together at 6 months and agreed we both saw marriage together, we didn’t end up getting married until 4 years into our relationship.

So, just because they see this future and are planning for it doesn’t mean they’re talking to the child about it, or that they’re going to rush and get married tomorrow.

Also, if the kid picks up that they are getting serious after 10 months of dating, so what? Do you expect OP to never date anyone seriously ever again, up until the very moment she decides to marry the person? It doesn’t work that way. Relationships progress over time, and if her kid notices the relationship is progressing, that’s life. If it doesn’t work out, it’s unfortunate, but again, that’s life. As long as OP isn’t saying things like, “Laura is going to be your new mom,” I don’t seen an issue with it. We cannot expect OP to never date seriously ever again because it might not work out and her child might be disappointed."

If they are not willing to change their behavior without the ultimatum, solely because they value the relationship and don't want to hurt you, then you should be heading out the door."
relationships,fpsphax,t1_fpshmni,1588877400.0,">Everyone thinks you know when you know yet we have a very high divorce rate because people...well...don't know when they know and what they thought they knew can change over time.

Our high divorce rate is much more complicated than that, and I can promise you that more divorces occur in people who weren't sure about their choice, but decided to get married after X years nonetheless, as in people who were confident about their choice. 

But back to the high divorce rate, the ""50% of marriages end in divorce"" statistic stems from the Boomer generation that a) got married very young and often didn't do as much dating as we do now, and b) were the first generation where divorce was an acceptable option for an unhappy marriage. So, those two things combined led many people to marry young and without playing the field (because that was what was still expected in the 40-60s), and then suddenly divorce becomes much more normal/acceptable from the 80s onward, and there you have it. A bunch of people who married young due to social expectations now have an easy out, and they took it. 

Divorce statistics are going down in recent years, and I think it's because younger generations DO date around a lot before marrying, and just generally live their live and have many experiences before settling down. It is much more acceptable to never get married these days, or to marry much later in life. So, if and when we do marry, we're not feeling like it's because we need to due to societal expectations. When we pick a spouse, it's a lot less likely that we're going to settle, because there is no reason to settle.  

But, none of that has anything to do with ""you know when you know.""  I'd say most married couples probably saw a future with their spouse within the first year. And in fact, if you're still questioning long-term compatibility with someone after a year of dating, I'd bet there's a much higher likelihood that the relationship will ultimately fail versus if you aren't questioning it."

As someone who was fully estranged from my father for the better part of a year, I don’t believe in ultimatums. I’m not going to use my presence as a reward for good behavior, or to convince my parents to do what they should already be doing. If you can’t act like a supportive and loving parent, then I will stop speaking to you. There’s no “do this, or I’ll stop speaking to you.” No, I’ll just stop speaking to you because it’s what’s best for me and my mental health.

So, if OP gets to a point where their role in her life is causing stress and toxicity, then there should be no ultimatum, just a decision imo."

Again, where did I say that?

There’s a ton of gray area between “suspicious of everything and trying to disprove your spouse as a first instinct,” and “automatically believing absolutely everything your spouse tells you without ever stopping to think critically for yourself.” And we all see where the latter mindset got the guy in OP’s story.

I hope your inability to think like a full-grown man with logic and reason works out for you, bud.

I know if I told my husband a paternity test was required for the birth certificate, he’d be very confused and want more information because he knows that’s not typical. Like, I can guarantee he’d at least google “(our state) mandatory paternity test birth certificate.” 

My husband trusts me fully, like I pretty much take care of everything in our lives, financially and otherwise. But he can absolutely still think for himself, and he does fact-check for himself because he’s a critical thinker. So, for the husband to just be like “Sounds right, ok!” and never even google search to find info about mandatory paternity tests is just... strange, and seems very naive/gullible. 

Paternity tests are a common topic to come up in popular culture, so it’s not like this is some obscure topic that people don’t have basic knowledge about just from navigating the world. Never have I heard anything about a test being required for a birth certificate, it is always mentioned in the context of infidelity, and as something people pursue on their own (unless there’s a court order, in which case no parties are confused about why they’re getting the test done). So, I just can’t imagine being told this information and not even bothering to do a quick little google search about it. Hell, at least confirm with the nurse who does the test, “So this test is mandatory for the birth certificate?”"

It’s also weird that he kept bringing it up in conversation. Like, who says repeatedly, “I couldn’t deny that baby even if we didn’t have a DNA test?” Nobody talks like that. Not unless they were suspicious their wife was cheating and wanted to broadcast to everyone, “FYI, I’m sure this is my baby.” But in that case, why would he need a “mandatory test” by the hospital to do it? Wouldn’t be be pursuing a test on his own, regardless of whether the hospital “requires” it or not?

Either way, it’s hard to believe someone is this gullible.
