She never showed up for work early that morning and signs of a struggle were found in the parking lot of her apartment. I grew up about half an hour from Mason City so it hits close to home.  

There have been suspects over the years but nobody has ever been charged with her abduction/probable murder. I go back and forth about what I think happened. Sometimes I think it could have been the older man who was upset she wouldn't date him (one of the suspects) and other times I think I could have just been a crime of opportunity, a stalker or random creeper that took her. I hope they can eventually figure out what happened and who did it, it'll have been 25 years this summer.

Maybe consider seeing a therapist if you don't know any good listeners or you want someone more objective. Getting your emotions out is super important though.
