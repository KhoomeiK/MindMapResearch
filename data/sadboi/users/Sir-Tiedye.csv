Stormlight_Archive,fqloaje,t3_gjkit0,1589462823.0,"TLDR: I agree, it’s really frustrating to read and see him go through that, but I think it was important to have this for a few reasons, mainly to be realistic and show whoever’s reading it that messing up isn’t bad and that you should still keep trying.

A) Like you said, he’s a bridgeman and a soldier, and now he’s not running bridges or fighting battles. He’s out of his element so of course he’s not going to be as awesome. But also, he still has tons of mental issues to deal with and since there aren’t physical issues to deal with, he has no choice but to face his mental issues.

B) The moral dilemmas are realistic, as is the brooding. A big part of depression (for me at least) is brooding and trying to figure out life and accepting that I’m wrong about some things. For Kaladin, this is his racism that he’s wrong about.

B.5) When reading it, I really identified with him so when he spoke his words at the end, it was more cathartic than it would have been otherwise. 

C) People make mistakes and progress isn’t linear and that’s realistic. With Kaladin, it’s realistic that he’s messing up and making mistakes and avoiding help. A lot of depressed people face their problems on their own and don’t like confiding in other people or asking for help, which is why he doesn’t trust Dalinar

D) People make mistakes and progress isn’t linear and that’s helpful for a reader who’s dealing with mental issues. Everyone who reads Stormlight Archive loves Kaladin and looks up to him. Then to see him make mistakes and mess up that badly, it says that even if you do mess up that bad, you’re still a good person. It says that even if you mess up, you have to still keep trying

Stormlight Archive remains the one series/book that I want to write an essay on."
