beyondthebump,fkvpqll,t3_fkwgvi,1584574155.0,This topic was brought up in our birthing class. Wasn't something we really thought of when decorating the nursery so once we were made aware we passed the info along to other families. Glad the baby was safe in the bassinet!
Miscarriage,fkqyedi,t3_fk43t4,1584458204.0,"I took a break from social media too. I couldn't stand the fact that someone (seems like everyone) is now pregnant/making announcemens/sharing pics, etc. A couple that attended the same birthing class as my husband and I gave birth a week apart with our first. When we got pregnant with our second and then finding out we lost our baby at 9 weeks she posted her announcement. We were due a week after them. It was a punch in the gut. I couldn't accept the fact that I lost my baby and was mad that other families got to keep theirs.

Not to mention my coworker announced her pregnancy at 5 weeks and now I have no choice but to watch her go through her pregnancy knowing I should've been farther along than her. She and I got married the same month/year AND had our first babies 3 months apart in the same year.  

The day of my d&c we took our daughter to her scheduled check up. Her pediatrician walked in and boom she was pregnant too. I was slapped in the face. 

What should've been my storyline too is a constant reminder of my loss."
