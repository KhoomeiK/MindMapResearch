AskReddit,fp9462k,t3_gc04i6,1588413644.0,"Grade 7 french class. At the start of the period it was my classes turn to go get our vaccinations (it was something that could be done through the school). We went to the teachers lounge with our french sub, got our shots and sat in the hall for the mandatory 10 minutes after to make sure no kids had an allergic reaction, passed out or what not. 

10 or so minutes pass and we go out side to the portable for class. We were told to stand at the back of the class to get our new seating arrangement. Now at the back of the class, where we were standing, there was a metal shelf with hooks to hang coats and our bags. We stand at the back of the class as the sub starts telling people where to sit. She gets though maybe half the class, when all of a sudden there it a loud clang, and then a thud. My friend who was standing next to me passes out. He hit his head on the metal shelf on his way down to the floor. Everyone stops. All the kids at the back of the class look at my friend, up at one another, to the teacher, and back to my friend. What the fuck do we do? Well the teacher, she goes back to assigning seats.

It was crazy. There heard the noise, look up and just ignored i tA couple kids, myself included, tried to tell her a kid passed out. She just told us to be quiet so she could assign us our seats. I think it was when one kid swore at the teacher a minute later, all the kids freaking out, and my friend started to regain consciousness that the teacher did something and listened to us. Friend ended up getting sent home. That was a terrifying moment.

Best part. The next day the friend that passed out, his mom called me to ""jokingly"" ask why I didn't catch her son. Like, get lost Karen. I wasn't looking at him when it happened. Plus, the kid had probably 100lbs on me at the time.

TL;DR     This was like 10 years ago. Some of the details are fuzzy, but this is the sum of it. Sub was to busy telling us where to sit to realize a kid passed out. Smh"

Don't force yourself to eat too much at one time or things you don't like. That can possibly make it so you won't want to eat.

Remember, it took time to lose the weight. It will take time to gain it back. Best of luck friend :)"

I don't feel i have the chance to say the balance of the gift card if for the meal and the tip. It feels weird to then leave a gift card you just used on the table as a tip when you leave.

I never use cash tips. That's not a common thing i found in Canada, if you pay with a card you tip with the card. But you're never asked about it if you use a gift card.

He's gone to see a few doctors and even got prescribed a medication that helped (once the dose size was tripled). He never got the prescription renewed so now he has to fend for himself. Maybe you and try some of what he does to see if it helps?

- lay down on a dark quiet space
- put ice packs on his head (the cold and pressure helps)
- a heating pad for the shoulders to help relax the muscles
- 2 Advil (only Advil. He says that nothing else works for him and a few others he knows with the same issue as him)
- a hot shower/bath

He also has some ""preventative"" things that help lower the frequency of his headaches. I really is just basic self care that everyone should do, but very few really do on a regular basis.

- cut down on sugar and fast foods (try to keep them as more of a treat here and there)
- as little caffeine as possible
- get moving (even if it is just pacing in the dark or doing a couple push ips or sit ups each day)
- water ( when in doubt drink a little water, at times the headaches may be due to dehydration.

It may also be possible that any medication you may be taking for your bipolar may be causeing the headaches. Take to your doctor. It may take some time but you may be able to find a medication that help to treat your bipolar without  such painful side effects.

I wish you the best of luck. ‚ù§"
