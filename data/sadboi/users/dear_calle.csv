unpopularopinion,fq8wj60,t3_ghe6c8,1589177614.0,"I think the issue is deeper than this. In my experience, women cannot behave in many ways that men can without being called a bitch. While being firm and unapologetic in an opinion may be seen as ""strong"" or ""confident"" in a man, it may be seen as bitchy in a woman.  Women get called bitches all the time for simply rejecting a man. Men can be passionate and angry about social/political issues, but many times, a woman is ""too emotional"" or ""bitchy."" Basically, society says anger is an acceptable emotion in men but not in women. You're right, if someone is being a bitch then you can call them one, and I think the level of tolerated ""bitchy"" behavior is much higher for men than women, in not all, but many, cases. 

I understand that my experience isn't universal though! Feel free to disagree, would love to talk about it :)"

A solid 80% of people in the store weren't wearing one. I was on the phone with my boyfriend at the time and told him, ""I'm giving everyone here without a mask on the middle finger."" I didn't, but I also didn't hide my resting bitch face."
Enneagram,fq8vqgj,t3_gha1j9,1589176922.0,"I'm almost exactly like you, except I feel like I'm 51% type 1 and 49% type 9! Right now, however, I probably resemble a 9 externally and a type 1 internally. I look like a type 9 on the outside because I am sleeping more, lacking motivation, struggling to be productive and generally feeling lazy. A person look at my lifestyle and actions right now probably wouldn't believe I was a 1. HOWEVER, the central inner critic of my oneness has never been louder than right now! No matter what I do, my house isn't clean enough, I'm not doing enough, and in general I am just criticizing myself a ton. I also feel myself moving toward 4 in stress right now, like ones do, which means that I am leaning much more into my negative emotions and basically shutting down and going off the radar a lot more nowadays. 

&#x200B;

When I HAVE rules and guidelines, solid places to be, etc., they are my life. However, when I'm left to my own devices, I will rest and relax like a fiend. However, that inner critic remains, telling me that I ""should"" always be doing more and being more productive. Basically, I'm rambling, but it's rough out there to both crave order yet struggle to find the motivation to create it on my own!!!"

Also, it’s never okay to mouth off to a person in authority like this. Even if you think you’re justified, it isn’t going to solve your problems. Your email was extremely immature, and if I were your professor, I DEFINITELY wouldn’t work with you or be flexible with you after this.

Also, elementary schools teachers have a tough job. We teachers need to stick together and not tear others down.

My hats go off to them because I would be completely useless and ineffective in front of children. 
I stay until about 5 every day, planning in my conference, and I don’t take work home. You can do it, but if you like working from the comfort or your home, that’s your freedom as well. But don’t act like you have it so much worse, because teaching is tough, but rewarding, for all of us :)"
