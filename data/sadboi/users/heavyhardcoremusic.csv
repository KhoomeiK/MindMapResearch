In the past this included my family and friends I consider family acting as if I were a werewolf & out to get me. When full moon would come around they would act scared. I had to wear fake teeth that looked like werewolf teeth, I had my own name as a werewolf, randomly they would bring it up in a conversation and ask what it's like to be one. Because they would love my soul... Ect 

The therapy in the past was intensive like that, and now I've been taught enough to do it on my own and not need a therapist. 

Nowdays I just think as much like a wolf and view myself as one for E.R.P reasons. I occasionally get called by my wolf name without warning, eat like a carnivore... Pretty much anything that most ppl won't notice.

I've tried many, the only ones with a good effect beyond feeling like a water pill or side effects and no help were:

Effexor XR
Adderall XR 

In the past where Adderall helped the ADHD, it made OCD and tics worse. 
And vice versa
Some meds helped OCD but made other diagnoses worse. 

Effexor seems to help my OCD, tics, anxiety. So I'm thinking if I got back on Adderall I may be able to withstand the medication without too much flair up in ocd.

This dentist is technically a ""medical professional"".

this dentist has committed MALPRACTICE by saying what he said in his post!!!

Because it adds a false sense of danger in many many smokers to try vaping, you know... To avoid all those nasty cancer causing carcinogens that combustible tobacco has...

There are a few other reasons about why this upsets me even MORE about his post.

#1 This guy is a dentist that should be providing accurate information regarding his profession... He is NOT

#2 this scares current smokers who are his followers to ever try vaping, Causing them to continue to have bad teeth.

#3 smoking causes MORE harm to the teeth than vaping!!!

#4 this post will keep a few individuals on cigarettes, causing there health to decline & there teeth. 

#5 he is hurting humanity by doing this post & promoting bad teeth/extremely expensive dentistry. 

#6 this is malpractice of dentistry 100%

I don't care what type of medical professional you are. It is absolutely wrong to promote something that causes your patients more damage to there body, rather than promoting a healthier alternative. (Note: I said healthier, not healthy)

If my personal dentist said ""you should start smoking, it's better for your teeth than those Vapes your using""
I would report my dentist to the state medical board for malpractice. Maybe even take some kinda legal action to prevent this dentist from telling this to other patients...

Medical professionals of any sort swear by oath to 
""do no harm"" 
Which is EXACTLY what this dentist (medical professional) is doing!

I grew up with both my parents as official doctors, when i switched to vaping they were proud of me as an adult. 
""At least your not getting carcinogens... But vaping is still bad just to let you know.""
Is what they would tell me. 

They're right, I'm not getting any cancer causing carcinogens.

Norepinephrine is only one part of adrenaline, there is noradrenaline and a lot of other things that build up to make full adrenaline. 

My psychiatrist told me that it might have a bit of a stimulating effect, but nothing like any stimulant drug such as adderal or  Vyvanse.

I typically find I don't feel like I'm on a stimulant, although I do find it raises mymotivation to do things like get out of the house, self care, exercise... ECT

I have a story to explain before I go any further

(Backstory, of how I got on effexor)
I had  alot of preexisting conditions, severe anxiety disorders & Major depression, ocd, and a few more. 
 
Almost 11 years of being an adrenaline junkie, I had already received countless concussions. I suspect it's what caused my disorders. 
My herniated disc, arthritis, damaged nerves in my hand (I can barely move my fingers, they hurt all the time) and nerve damage to my sacrum after breaking it into 4 pieces. (it's a triangleish shape bone that's pretty much the end of your spine) 


Some asshole slammed my head slammed against a wall at a concert, then punched my face knocking my head back into the wall... Gave me mild brain injury & concussion syndrome. 
It Made me have 4-5 panic attacks daily (on top of my already pretty severe OCD / anxiety / depression))

Pretty much I was going to kill myself if it lasted any longer the way it was after the last concussion. 

So effexor just returned me back to my normal self before the concussion. 
Which is also pretty horrible. 


I had been given opiates maybe once for a broken ankle, but that was over 6 years ago. 



I'll give you an update on if it helped me or not, if anything.
