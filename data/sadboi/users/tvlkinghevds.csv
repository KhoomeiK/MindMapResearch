I think it will be easier to convince them to take their meds than to shake a core belief. To me, when I'm in a state of psychosis and someone tries to give evidence of the contrary, I find it abrasive and think that the person is trying to trick me. And when multiple people are trying to get me out of a delusion, they are all ""in on it"" and conspiring against me. Instead, find a way to get them to take their meds; in some cases antipsychotics are injectable for people who won't take medication on their own."
