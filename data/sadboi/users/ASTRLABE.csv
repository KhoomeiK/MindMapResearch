This isn't to say that you aren't a kind and compassionate person, who would never think about doing something cruel or manipulative when you're removed from the situation.

The truth is? Nobody is perfectly healthy, with the perfect responses to every situation, reacting rationally and selflessly. We're all a little manipulative, a little cruel, a little irrational. The difference that will separate you, disorder or not, is whether you can accept the consequences of your actions, and whether you can learn from those consequences to be a better person moving forward.

If you think you're immune to being kind of a bad person, friend, partner, spouse, parent, then it'll be difficult to accept your consequences and grow from them.

Edit: as for a guide, your best bet is to listen to those around you. the only thing that'll get you towards being your most ideal self regardless of your emotional state is experience, love, and patience."

I'm an outsider to this disorder, whose interest was sparked after a lifetime with loved ones who exhibited severe traits, and after a few traumatic events, was made aware in my own (mandatory) therapy of the possibility that the confusion and hopelessness and helplessness I felt around them could have an answer.

&#x200B;

That said, when I first began trying to understand the disorder, DBT has consistently been exhibited as the strongest form of treatment for those with the BPD and other disorders that could be described as emotionally chaotic.

I recommend taking another commenter on their offer about information for CBT, to explore your options, but as far as I've understood, DBT is the gold-standard for treatment.

&#x200B;

My own personal advice? Don't be in a relationship with anyone for a while. You have to get to a point where you understand, with clarity, what your weaknesses in interpersonal relationships are. That will take time and a lot of experience in self-reflection. It won't be easy, and you'll need a strong support network that will allow you the opportunity to make mistakes, but also hold you accountable, and pry into your motivations for those mistakes with the end result being that you'll start recognizing your faults before others, and hold your own self accountable."

If your team is relying on only you for grievous wounds, they're being selfish, but if push comes to shove then grievous is such a powerful debuff vs certain comps / champs and it will outshine your own personal damage output."
kaisamains,fpv64fu,t3_gezz44,1588936202.0,"Kaisa doesn't have a great laning phase, though it's not abysmal. Your best bet is to focus on wave manipulation to have a good lane state to survive laning phase and make you gank resistant, farming efficiently and taking good base timers, playing to force fights once you get your first powerspike (your Q evolve).   


Kai'sa becomes absurdly powerful once you get all 3 evolves, and if you are even or slightly behind by that point then you should start being able to hard carry fights with your long-range poke / repositioning tools / assassination potential.

&#x200B;

Surviving lane isn't the only potential outcome for Kaisa though. There's a lot of matchups that you can outrade, or outpush, or have a stronger 2v2 in, and you'll get to know those matchups with experience and failure.

&#x200B;

If your support sucks, just give up CS that is being zoned by the enemy and grab every CS that is free until you get past laning phase. It might even be beneficial to give up your own tower early if you end up falling really far behind, so that you can farm in the side lane near your tier 2 turret while the enemy bot lane aimlessly runs around the map getting random kills and your team spam pings you, despite the fact that they're giving up XP and gold and not converting kills into objectives."

I can't say the same of everyone with BPD. If I had to guess about his motivations in your situation, it's an aspect of the push-pull of that fear of intimacy / abandonment. It can be even worse outside of a relationship than within one, because there's no defined version of themselves as an aspect of your life anymore.

BPDlovedones,fo2jwd6,t1_fo2gv32,1587465219.0,"Other than therapy and time? 

Well for the first, I can give some wisdom that my own therapist gave me early on during the post-breakup. He told me that I had formed an incredibly intricate bond with my ex, and because I'd taken on so many roles as caretaker / parent / friend / mentor / boyfriend, I'd been forced to weave all of my bonds into this person, and it left me without many attachments to other people. When our relationship was severed, I'd been left with dozens of loose threads with no purpose, and it left me feeling worthless. I'd spent a while trying desperately to attach each thread back to her, but he told me that it was best to find other people that I'm able to fill those roles with in my life. 

Her sudden betrayal wasn't cheating, but I'd been consumed with similar unrelenting and pervasive thought patterns. Talking with my therapist, growing closer to my family, finding more connections and acquaintances and reconnecting with old ones has definitely diminished them, though not fully. Find a therapeutic hobby too, something that distracts you from your internal thoughts and doesn't hyperfocus on them (work with your hands not your brain).

You might also want to ask about temporary medication for anxiety. 

It surely won't be easy, and you will struggle immensely. Telling you that you'll eventually overcome won't help you now, but there will be few options that will provide immediate relief, if there's any at all. I absolutely DO NOT recommend self-medicating; it should be obvious, but for a while I thought I had no choice and it almost killed me."
BPD,fo2iw7s,t3_g5cggx,1587464136.0,"You'll have to talk to him about it for there to be a solution, but I'd very much recommend you come fully prepared emotionally speaking. That doesn't mean trying to counter arguments he might make or try to win. I mean you have to be prepared to focus entirely on resolving the situation with full respect to both of you. 

He may have a sound and logical reason that has nothing to do with you as to why he's not replying nearly as quickly. But there could be an underlying issue. It is unlikely that it's as drastic as him not loving you anymore, or feeling stuck with you, but there might be something that's lacking in your relationship that has left him feeling a little more apathetic. That feeling is totally normal and common, but it will become a problem if left uncommunicated by both of you. 

If you feel like he just says whatever you think you  want him to say, like empty reassurances, then you need to make it more clear about how you feel or that your only goal is to have a stronger and more complete relationship. This might allow him to feel comfortable enough to speak his mind, and you have to respect whatever grievances may follow and listen and understand and be empathetic, even if you might not fully agree. If you feel yourself on the cusp of heating up and getting ready to become defensive or even aggressive towards him or the conversation, then you should excuse yourself and try and reset and restart the dialogue when you cool down. It will become so much harder for your partner to trust in your earnestness towards a loving relationship if you end up escalating, denying, or manipulating.

I'm speaking as an ex of someone with BPD, and not a therapist or professional. There are things I wish I had been able to talk about at the time that I've realized in my own therapy sessions led to our break-up, though it often feels like it would have been minimal in the long run."

When someone says they are done you have to respect it. The relationship won't progress any further if one of you isn't as committed as the other. It sounds like there is still a lot of love. Take this time to better yourself, find joy in yourself, and be stronger and more resilient. Talk to friends and family, talk to a therapist.

BPDlovedones,fjcuc8g,t3_fcskfd,1583236976.0,"BPD is a spectrum. No two people with it are really the same. There's a large amount of traits in a shared pool that help classify them, but the DSM only requires 5 out of 9 major symptoms to diagnose.

It's also not true that two healthy and stable people in a marriage can work anything out. There are fundamental incompatibilities that aren't capable of finding compromise.

Plus I don't really think there's a good definition of ""healthy"" or ""stable"" so much as we know what's unhealthy and unstable, and even then I think there's room for subjectivity. 

Lots of people cheat and have affairs and betray one another. I think it's unfair to say they're all suffering from the same core disorder."

Him telling you that you aren't ""improving fast enough"" seems indicative enough to me that he isn't worth your time. Progress, especially with BPD, is very non-linear. You shouldn't worry about someone who isn't supportive of that fact. 

I'd try to focus more on what you need to improve on. Seek out and grow your support network. Find meaningful relationships that have clear boundaries, for yourself and for them.

I'm sorry if this advice isn't the kind you are looking for. It hurts losing someone you care about, especially when it occurs so dramatically and results in you questioning your self-worth and stability."

It likely won't end well for you or them, even with a lot of self-awareness and effort. It will be an emotional roller coaster from start to finish.

I was willing to ride it with my ex until the day I died, because I always saw behind the maskâ€”the abuse and manipulation and love bombing. 

But it still didn't end well. Their personality is like fighting against a force of nature using nothing but tired screams. Their destruction is inevitable, but also amoralâ€”in the sense that I've come to understand that there's not a ""good"" or ""bad.""  You can't reason with an earthquake, expect compassion returned from a tornado. You also won't really understand the wealth of rain during a drought. It'll seem like a blessing.

BPD,fj6apy2,t3_fbhy0d,1583065025.0,"I think a lot of people have a severe misunderstanding of how entrenched something like BPD is. It's very difficult to grasp, even if you're well-informed and well-meaning. In retrospect there were a lot of comments I made to my ex that I've since learned were dismissive and ended up precipitating the discard. There were a lot of things that constantly caused tension between us, and I eventually reached my own breaking point. I told her trying isn't good enough anymore. 

I'm deeply sorry for the turmoil that hearing something like that can evoke. The stress of everyday living is hard enough on it's own without being made to feel like you're not trying to survive it.

I wish I knew better back then, but I'm still not entirely sure it would have been enough.

Take good care of yourself, in whatever ways that requires. Trying is good enough. Failure will happen. Maybe you'll never really succeed, but you should always look to a life you can be proud of."

It isn't even all of it. There were so many instances of wild behaviour that made me question my sanity. So many curses and hurtful words and actions that made me deeply upset. I still have nightmares about them, about her. 

I'm working on preventing myself from romanticizing the ordeal. Every time she came back into my life I begged for her compassion and respect and love. She'd keep saying it was still there, that we could be together again, but later insult me whenever I try to find that high again."
abuse,fiocacp,t1_fio9dru,1582580456.0,"I wish I'd done it the first time I realized how destructive her behavior was. She threatened suicide, or was maybe really was in such a dark place that it was the only option, if I ended up leaving her. She'd done so a few times before, but when she left this time I didn't follow her out the door. She left her phone wallet and keys and I didn't see her for six hours. I got drunk and so worried I'd thrown up. 

Logically I knew that I wouldn't be responsible for it... but I didn't want to have it haunt me regardless. After she came back I told her if she sought therapy, got clean, and worked on her self-esteem and self-worth then there might still be a chance for us.

But I should have left then. I was too emotionally exhausted and a future with her looked bleak even if she did do all of those things.

She ended up dredging my behavior up from that period where I was questioning the validity of our relationship as some of the reasons she lost all trust and love for me. I didn't get her enough flowers, or enough presents. I forgot to get her something on Valentine's Day, but I bought a couples massage for later that week to make up for it. I wasn't... super affectionate, and kind of put a lot of emotional space between us. I was honest about it. I told her that just because she's working on her betterment doesn't mean I can accept her fully yet. I still needed to recover, and I needed to learn to trust her again, but I wasn't slouching and I was trying just as much as she was. I thought she understood.

But when we broke up every little mistake or misstep or forgotten promise I'd ever made built up into ""all the trust I had for you was a mistake,"" and ""you never loved me,"" and ""i felt like you'd been holding me emotionally hostage."" 

My perception was that, in the months since she made her decision to get sober, our relationship was the best it'd ever been and we'd made such great progress just being in love again. I'd honestly even forgotten most of the fucked up shit that happened between us. I was shocked to hear that she thought I'd betrayed her so dramatically.

those comments were what sent my anxiety into overdrive. i didn't defend myself. i wanted desperately to still trust her. i didn't want to invalidate her. i gave no resistance to the onslaught of negative aspects of my character that i was just now finding out.

i started drinking. it eventually lead to my hospitalization."

relationships,fimt8vm,t1_fimrgcd,1582546098.0,"It's a doozy. It felt like it was a slow burn since we got together.

The window in which we broke up came as a surprise though.

We'd been living apart long distance for about four months before we split. I had gotten assigned overseas, and we decided it wasn't time to get married just yet and instead focus on ourselves during this time â€” still together, but exploring new things without the codependency we'd developed the year prior. About a month prior to the breakup, I'd been working without any weekends off and for 12-14 hours a day for nearly 40 days, and because of the time zone difference I really only got to call her while she was on her break at work and very briefly in the morning. I'd tried not to let the work stress interfere, but I'd occasionally get frustrated with her and then she'd start getting frustrated with me and it developed into a palpable tension. 

But I recognized it. Sometimes she'd call me out on me being kind of a dick, and I'd agree and apologize and I'd try to let her in on all of the things that have been stressing me out so much. Id usually kept work stuff out of our relationship, but I told her that the long days and increased responsibility and fear of failure in the environment I was in was starting to get to me.

I also started expressing insecurities about the long distance. It isn't that I didn't trust her, but I missed her and felt alone out here. I'd told her I need her to be strong for me.

After I had opened up one morning she called me crying saying that we needed to break up. It felt like we were finally back to being trusting of one another again and it shocked me completely. 

She said ""the idea of being single is enticing,"" but that I was ""still the love of her life."" The gist of it then was that she wanted to be independent and find herself.

I told her it felt really unfair, especially since I had helped her through such tremendous emotional hurdles before I left the country, and I feel a little cheated that she was unwilling to do the same for me. She just said ""I know I feel guilty, but I'm still not at a place where I can be there for you, or anyone.""

A week goes by and we still try to talk. Conversation is haggard and heavy. I try to convince her that I'd be willing to make whatever adjustments are necessary, that I will go seek therapy so that she isn't overwhelmed by my emotional needs. But she still says she wants to break up.

I tell her if that's the case, the limbo that we are in is far too much for me to handle and I think it's best if we just cut off all contact. She flies into a panic, trying to message me and call me, and tells me that ""I need you more than I need this idea I have."" But it doesn't feel genuine.

I don't talk to her until the next morning. I tell her that it's shitty of her to want to have her cake and eat it too and I can't have my feelings treated do casually. She tells me she knows, that she's been in too many toxic relationships and shes become toxic herself. 

I ask if she talked to her doctor about her decision to break up with me, and she says she hasn't. I tell her it'd be a good idea to.

... after her appointment she tells me she's more sure than ever about letting go. 

In the following week I try to receive some elaboration, an explanation â€” at the very least on why she keeps flip flopping on whether we should be together. 

And then she explodes. She tells me I'm just like all of her other exes, that l the trust she put into me was totally unjustified, that she'd spent so long thinking she was this villain and I was some perfect martyr, and that I was cruel and unpleasant and she was pathetic for ever loving me.

 And... then I wound up in the hospital."
relationships,fimr2o1,t1_fimq7ke,1582543580.0,"I don't want to label her as anything. I've done a lot of research on the issues she's been diagnosed with, and on some others that seem to fit. But I'm not her doctor and it's hardly comforting to be aware of all the ways in which she might be maladjusted if she's not going to consider the possibility. Bringing up even minor grievances ends pretty harshly, I can't imagine what accusing her of bigger issues would do.

I'm also still really confused as to what my role is in the decline of our entire relationship, since she's been very vague and oftentimes overly critical of (in my opinion) very minor behaviors of mine. I didn't try to dismiss them when they were brought up, but she wouldn't even feel comforted or assured by my willingness to do better / differently."

I have been seeing a psychologist. He's said similar things about the mirroring of abusive behavior. I haven't had his services since I've been deployed the last few months, when things started to get progressively worse in our non-dialogue. If I had the ability to see him before I decided to fuck things up, I probably wouldn't be in this situation. 

Some part of me still wants to reconcile with her. It's super difficult losing a friendship that held on all those years, only to fall apart because the dysfunction we knew each other to have was too much to bear in an intimate setting. I know it's not the right decision for her or myself though."
