Most HOAs I've come across focus their efforts on punishment rather than taking action to make things better. Often they'll budget for inspectors to go around the neighborhood so they can fine people on minor things that some uppity HOA member insists upon, instead of addressing legitimate concerns like street lights being out.  


The other thing to consider is the type of people HOAs can attract. Much like politics, HOA influence is treated as a form of currency. Plenty of HOAs have been caught intentionally causing damage to residents that won't bend to their will, or for some other reason have become a target for harassment. In my personal experience, HOAs almost always do residents harm with how they handle business and the limited ""good"" that is done isn't worth the headaches they cause."

Voting in local elections is necessary. Voting in the general election for someone is a choice. Obviously it's better to be able to vote, but if you truly believe neither candidate is going to better this country, you're exercising your right to not vote on the basis of what you believe to be best for the country. If you vote and your candidate loses, that's your right all the same. If you want to tell people what they should do and attack them for not doing what you think is right, you're crossing a line into infringing upon those rights"

bestof,flam4uu,t1_flahk8n,1584986589.0,"Your disrespectful and narrow-minded attitude is exactly what makes people not have faith in voting for Biden.. local elections are obviously important, but until the entire voting process, gerrymandering, and election holidays are implemented nothing will change. Taking time off work to vote is simply not a possibility in many communities, particularly where people work 2-3 jobs. The fish rots from the head - without proper leadership nothing will get better. This isn't a discussion or civil discourse, you just want a sounding board for your opinions. You don't give a car a new paint job to fix a busted engine"
bestof,flaeaoq,t1_flacitf,1584982158.0,"I think if you were on the fence about Bernie and saw all of the opponents drop out and support Biden that's reasonable for it to discourage voter turnout in the primary. Most Sanders supporters I've spoken to have simply lost faith in the Democratic party standing for anything, and sound more disenfranchised than anything. Voting for Bernie was the only way to stand by what they believed in, but once Biden secured the moderate vote (by virtue of all other candidates dropping out and endorsing him when publicity was reaching peak).. that's where I start to get concerned about general election voting.

While it is not an accurate assessment to say Biden is in the same category as Trump, it is within people's rights to *not vote* for anyone based on their own moral philosophy. Hard to stomach the idea of 4 more years, but the divides in this country are far deeper than two political parties. If someone chooses not to vote in the hopes of a better candidate becoming available in 4 years, that's certainly something that would raise eyebrows.. but I can't say it would be shocking or unexpected based on present data."
