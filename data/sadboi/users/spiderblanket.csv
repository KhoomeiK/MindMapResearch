In college I had failed a class and my boyfriend at the time offered to pay for me to retake it that summer and to pay him back over time, it was like $600-$700 or something. I never asked him or even considered it, he just offered and insisted because I needed to get my grades up (I grew up really poor and he grew up upper middle class so our view of money was different I guess). So I accepted his offer and got an A+ in the class! But we ended up breaking up that summer. 

When Fall quarter started I gave his roommate a check to give to him and he was so shocked that I actually paid him back and on time that he pulled me aside at a party to tell me how much he appreciated it and thought I was such a good person. I didn‚Äôt think that, I just knew that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do. We ended up getting back together because of that but only lasted a few more months.
