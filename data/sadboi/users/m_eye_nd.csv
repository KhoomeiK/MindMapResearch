relationships,fr467md,t1_fr3rmqz,1589877225.0,"It was difficult for me when I felt I needed to tell my therapist about the sexual abuse I’d endured. I also felt so awkward about it like you. You can always write it down in a note or email them before your session and say I don’t feel comfortable saying this out loud so I wanted to give you some background info before I come to the session. Either way (if they are a good therapist) they will not think “oh my god this is TMI” they are trained to deal with all the info, they *want* all the info to help you. And sex is a part of life. Sex is actually a common issue people speak to therapists about. You have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about. 

I left my sexual trauma for so long, until it kept coming back up. Flashbacks, panic attacks, ruining relationships. I developed sexual aversion and intimacy avoidance and now I’m trying to deal with that in therapy. I would encourage you to look those two things up to just be aware of them, because sexual abuse can trigger such issues.

Yes in society we seem to do things backwards. We are physically intimate with people before even building the intimacy when it comes to relationships. Not everyone is like this though. And even if they are, you don’t have to be if it’s not what works for you. Opening up to someone emotionally and being intimate with them takes a long time because you have to build trust first. That’s why getting to know someone and building a friendship should be the starting points of any relationship. It’s also important to not want to share deep and personal things with others right away until you genuinely have built that trust with them. Because there are abusive people out there looking to exploit others vulnerabilities. It’s all about having boundaries. I really encourage you to look up boundaries, get clear on what yours are, how to firmly apply them and how to back them up with consequences.

I advise you to absolutely stop all forms of sexual contact. You need to deal with the anxieties around this first before engaging in sexual activity. Otherwise you are going to keep re-traumatising yourself. Sex is a trigger for you, so we have to work out what about it is triggering and how to handle the trigger in the moment. That’s something a therapist should help you with. Be aware that you may (if not already) need a therapist who is a sex therapist and specialises in that particular area. 

You said - it’s frustrating wanting to be intimate with someone new, but can’t because it makes you scared - first of all, there is no need to get frustrated or mad at yourself about this. You have been sexually abused and made to feel bad about your body sexually - this is a normal reaction. Understand that, be kind to yourself about it and patient. If you’re going to get to a place where you’re comfortable with sex, you’ll have to first get to a place of being comfortable with your self. Which means rebuilding your self image, being comfortable with your own sexuality and being a sexual being. And establishing what your sexual boundaries are. 

Based on all of this, it doesn’t seem like now is an appropriate time to be entering a romantic relationship, FWB, or having sex with someone. Your attention and energy needs to be on yourself and healing. Along the way you will figure out what it is you need and what relationships and sex all means to you. Like for now you have figured out casual sex isn’t your thing and you don’t like to have sex until you have built a solid relationship with someone. That’s completely okay! Sex is about what works for you. What you’re comfortable with. Some people are happy to wait, some people also don’t like to jump right in and others aren’t happy to wait - which is fine too that’s their preference and just means you’re not compatible. 

Don’t worry, you’re not broken, you are normal and this can get better. Be patient and kind with yourself and face this head on in therapy! I promise it can get better."

I feel all sorts of pressure from him and like I should compromise out of guilt. I question if it is a red flag too or if he generally just isn’t very good at all of this. I think he has weak boundaries himself, so respecting mine isn’t necessarily in his level of awareness. I have had to explain to him what boundaries are because he didn’t know. But it’s got the point where any touch is bad for me because whenever I would allow any touch for him he had to have his tongue all the way down my throat or have it lead to sex. I don’t want full on, he knows that. So now I just flat out don’t want him touching me. I’m sure that feels crappy for him, but if he’d have took me seriously from the start I wouldn’t feel so unsafe doing small physically intimate things like hugging or holding hands.

I have so many times explained to him about my sexual abuse, how it triggers me. But the entire relationship he continuously makes jokes about sex when I tell him not to. Continuously tries his luck when I’ve let him know I’m not feeling it. Example (pre corona we don’t live together): I asked him to run a bath and he said “why don’t have you one after we have sex - he says stupid things like that but then will say he’s only joking... but he knows sex is a trigger for at the moment. I’ve cried to him. Confided in him with my sexual abuse. I just don’t get it. 

When reading these texts does it seem like he’s trying to test my boundaries? I mean, he says don’t make me wait too long and then when I call him out on it he says he would never say those things when he knows how serious it is for me...is that not gaslighting? And then says “As a joke baby” which he I’ve also told him numerous times I hate being called baby. 

It’s getting to the point where I don’t see a future with him anymore. He’s a good person aside from this, but it just doesn’t make sense me to me why he keeps going on with that and dismissing me when I say I’m not ok with it. I’m trying to reasonable."

We’ve been together over 6 months. I’ve suffered sexual abuse in my childhood and teens that he knows about. Before lockdown (we live separately) I was struggling with sex and stuff which I communicated to him. We had a few arguements because he kept making sexual jokes or trying to initiate sex when I’d expressed I’m not ok with it right now.  I took it as him not really understanding what triggers are and I’ve really tried to educate him. He’s not been through any abuse or anything so he’s not familiar with it all. 

Anyway we haven’t seen each other over two months because of lockdown, but these are the texts I got today. He goes from messaging me saying he’s not so horny and how it’s good for us, to saying he’s worried he might not get it back. And then when the subjects changed he brings it back to making inappropriate comments about having sex on his car.  And then when I tell him it’s triggering for me he makes a joke not to make him wait too long. 

I can’t make sense of it.  He knows it’s a big deal for me, but can’t help himself. This isn’t a one off, he’s always joking about it no matter how much I say it’s not ok. What do you guys make of this?

I’m almost at the point I want to break up with him over it now."

I’ll also be really honest here and say, I have fantasised about it too. About someone coming to my rescue, seeing how much pain I am in and validating me by letting me know none of that was ok and that none of that should have ever happened to me. I have in the past (and it took me a while to catch onto this) ‘daydreamed’ about being in a really bad accident, or something happening to me...and everyone all of a sudden showing they care and looking after me. 

I actually did get into an accident, quite serious. I received lots of messages from people I don’t even speak to and only 2 of my friends showed up to see me in hospital. Life is ironic, but even seeing people show they cared it didn’t scratch that itch. I just didn’t take it as genuine which I guess looking back at my past and how I’ve been treated, that would be a logical response. It made me feel even more alone to realise no amount of care from people now can undo that lack of care (which feels like abandonment to me) in my past. 

I guess that’s the small girl in me that never really felt anyone cared or was there when I was in pain. I was let down by the whole system not just my friends and family. That need to be cared for, that need to be seen and heard is still very very loud in me because it was dismissed over and over and over again. Nurturing is paramount to how we develop, if people get it wrong they really F us up! It’s a lonely, numb, achey, yearning feeling and you’re not alone in it. I hear your pain, I share some of your pain, I care for your well-being and future."

It doesn’t help Rinna making snide comments to Kyle. I thought she was going to make a valid point, but saying she doesn’t stick up for friends over her sister is just clutching at straws. And the bitchy remarks from Kyle to Denise were rude, especially at her own house, but I did find Denise’s tone rather patronising. 

I can see why Kyle overreacted at the dinner party because she felt she was defending Teddi and Teddi didn’t even bother to address it she could have said “look Kyle I get where you’re coming from, but honestly I was fine with Dorit being late so we can just drop it” OR “I agree with Kyle, I was annoyed at you Teddi because of x y and z and I’d like to address that”. Instead she let Kyle stick up for her sat back and said nothing, whilst Kyle got a bit of a backlash for it from Dorit, Rinna and Denise - so she overreacted because she probably felt a bit ganged up on when in her head she most likely thought she was being a bit of a SJW and a good friend to Teddi and Teddi didn’t even back her up."

There’s a reason why it statistically takes both men and women several tries before they actually leave an abusive partner. However, I do understand this misconception about just leaving, because from the outside it would seem pretty easy to just up and leave, it would seem the logical thing to do.

He bitches about Ariana claiming she’s miserable or whatever, when she’s spoken about her mental health issues on the show a lot.

He can’t even word it right, the way he said it was like he was so disgusted to even pretend to have a “mental health thing”.

He’s a Sociopathic Narcissist, the worst kind and when he doesn’t get his own way or the attention, admiration and delusional respect he thinks he deserves, it’s a narcissistic injury to him which makes him fly into a rage. I honestly wish that the show would actually address his behaviour, make an example out of him.

Honestly, I have suffered CSA and sexual abuse growing up into adulthood. The thoughts and feelings I sometimes I have I’m literally like *what in the world is going on inside my head right now*. We were dragged into a dark world - it’s not your fault and it’s complex, it’s not easy, it’s confusing. 

If your wife knows about what you’ve been through, maybe you can chat to her about this. Maybe you can even try that with your wife. But just know, whatever reaction you get, you have been abused, it changes you, be gentle with yourself. Don’t punish or scold yourself for having these feelings and thoughts. And also know, just because you have these feelings and thoughts doesn’t mean when you act on them it will play out like you thought it would in your head. I’ve tried out some stuff with my partner thinking for some reason it’s what I wanted, or maybe it was going to help me, or just quiet down some thoughts in my head.

I’m definitely going to look into a trauma and sex therapist. Although I really like my current trauma therapist, I might even discuss this with her she may know of other therapists to help. 

I have spoken to my partner, sadly it’s been really difficult for him to understand. To someone who doesn’t have trauma it seems even understanding what it means to be triggered is confusing. He will try to be physically intimate and I will have to tell him no I am not ok with it. And then a few hours later or something he may try again. I have to remind him that my trauma isn’t just something that lasts an hour it’s going to last a lifetime for me and sometimes it’s manageable sometimes it’s not. It’s difficult navigating through this in a relationship. I have officially stopped drinking! Only on occasions like birthdays and I limit myself. It’s definitely helped. I push myself way too far like bdsm and role play when I’m black out drunk and it actually just ends up re-traumatising me. Apparently drunk me thinks I deserve that. 

Thank you for that suggestion I’m definitely going to check out guided yoga meditation!

I wouldn’t consider dancing and sports to be something where you engage in any kind of touch - or is that like dancing with someone and doing sports where you would here and there coming into contact with people? This is really interesting I’ve never come across that but it definitely makes sense to me that non-sexual touch is a good starting point. It makes me realise that I’m actually not all that great with non sexual touch either. That’s something I’m going to work on thank you for that!
adultsurvivors,fp21tq5,t1_fp20sjo,1588253358.0,"I’ve pondered that thought too. I think I definitely leaned more towards being asexual growing up, I’m 24 now. I never really got much out of any sexual kind of interaction. I didn’t really understand the hype and actually thought it was more just for the guys pleasure. But then again, I don’t know if that’s just because I wasn’t yet comfortable and I felt like I was doing those things because everyone else was.

I have had realisations that I’ve never truly felt comfortable just expressing my sexuality. That’s something I know I need to work on. I can’t help but find it disgusting and it makes me feel wrong. Even though I know it’s not! I know that’s partly societies fault for how they demonise women’s sexuality. I also know I feel wrong because of my sexual abuse. 

It’s an odd one because I do have a libido it’s just not all that high I’d say a little under average. But it’s definitely there. But when it comes down to it (I’m in a relationship) I feel so gross and used and ashamed of myself afterwards. It’s a truly horrible experience for me. But, get me a drunk and I am really hyper-sexual and definitely enjoy it but don’t consider it intimate in anyway. 

And sometimes I enjoy being in peoples company, like with my boyfriend but only if I know he isn’t going to instigate sex, hugs, kissing, or anything of that sort. Which just isn’t realistic so most of the time in that respect, no I’m not even comfortable in someone’s company because I’m aware there is always something wanted of me or I’m expected or hoped to comply in attending to a need which is normal but doesn’t sit well with me. 

Sorry for the lengthy response, I realise I’ve dumped my whole throught process out here!"

adultsurvivors,fp20o9d,t3_gatj8p,1588252620.0,"First off, you’re not alone you’ve got this community and we definitely get how you feel! 

Secondly, I am so so sorry that people have let you down especially your own Mother. It’s completely normal to want for someone to care for you. We are social creatures, nurturing is an important part of our development. Not feeling cared for will absolutely make you feel lonely. And I really do understand how you feel about wondering if people will always just abuse you and treat you badly because everyone has let you down so much in the past. I’ve been let down by my family, my childhood friends, new friends, the school and the police and even then my university. It’s like even when I tried to actively avoid situations that may put me in danger or around crappy people (like drinking, being too naive and letting anyone into my life and sharing too much too soon) I still was let down by society in some way. 

I’ve come to realise there will always be disappointment in life. Humans are imperfect it’s inevitable. But because I’ve experienced so much disappointment and pain even the slightest bit feels like a really big deal to me. 

Don’t talk an ex. They are an ex for a reason. Leave them in the past along with whatever pain came with them. Don’t dig that stuff back up. Being aware of why we want to enter into a relationship (whether that’s a friendship or romantic) is always super important. In this instance, you want to because you’re lonely. And there’s nothing wrong that, but it’s not a good reason to jump back into anything. It’s to fill a void and if that person leaves the void will still be there. So it’s best to fill and work at that void by yourself. 

I’d first start addressing your codependency issues. These don’t go away without hard work. I’m also codependent in some aspects because of an abusive ex. The biggest help I find is strengthening your boundaries. Google articles, find books, even workbooks, look up what it means to have healthy boundaries. How to have them, what to do when people don’t respect them. Figure out what is acceptable behaviour for you and what’s not. What are and aren’t you ok with - those are your boundaries. People with healthy strong boundaries are less likely to be abused and it also helps build your self esteem. Boundaries and self esteem go hand in hand. Looking into what your attachment style is in a relationship is also good. 

Then move on to studying your loneliness. What is it you are desiring? What about an ex or what they can offer is it that you think will help end what you’re feeling now? Don’t try to find ways to drown out or avoid or cover up how you feel (like talking to an ex). Instead, find ways to understand how you’re feeling and what it is you need that will help you feel better and is a healthy solution that will have long terms effects.

What ways do you take care of yourself? You want to be cared for - start with caring for yourself. Do you have any self care rituals? I like to have baths with bath salts and candles and calming music. I like to draw (I’m not even good it’s just for fun) and listen to jazz music (I actually like hip hop and drum and bass and other music but jazz is calming). I mediate sometimes, but if I’m honest I don’t always keep up with this as much as i’d like to. I sometimes put on a good movie and have some popcorn and just forget about everything. Turn my phone off, grab my fluffy bear (I’m 24) and relax, light an incense stick or dab some lavender essential oil on my clothes which really calms me. 

Journaling really helps. Just writing down how you feel what’s going on in your head it’s a form of release - it also signals to your brain that you’re processing your emotions which makes it easier for your brain to go “Ok we’ve acknowledged that, now we can move on to the next thing” since the mind is always trying to focus on something. You don’t have to make sense, have the correct spelling or even make your writing look all neat - it’s for your eyes only. I recently read an old journal from several months back. It actually really helped me look at how far I’ve come and other things I need to work on still. Its a great way to discover behaviour patterns and come to realisations about things.

unpopularopinion,fou8no9,t1_fou6lbv,1588078945.0,"That’s really not true and I’d advise you to look into this some more to educate yourself on the matter. I would get where you’re coming from if things were as black and white like that, but they’re not. 

You don’t even need to be mentally or emotionally unstable to go to therapy. And if you are, well done for getting help that’s a brilliant step. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with having trouble navigating through your emotions and needing some help with that. Some people don’t have great role models that demonstrate a good example of coping mechanisms. Some people don’t actually have anyone and going to therapy can provide that support network. We are social creatures and having a good support network contributes to general well-being. 

I think you don’t quite understand how therapy works. I’ve been to therapy and I have a psychology degree because I wanted to go on to be a clinical psychologist. A therapist doesn’t fix, solve or change your problems for you. What a therapist does is prompt you to look at things differently and explore all avenues. A therapist helps prompt you to come to your own conclusions. They do not oppose their own opinions or advice on you or tell you what to do. It’s not disconcerting at all. You say having a chat is fine, but going to friends and family to discuss life problems can provide you with biased feedback. A therapist is not emotionally attached to you, does not have any preconceived judgements or expectations of you and can provide better logic and understanding of a situation because they are quite literally trained in doing so. So it actually makes more sense to speak to a therapist than to have a chat with a friend when regarding life problems. Absolutely nothing disconcerting about that. I would encourage you to really challenge these views because they heavily reflect mental health stigma. 

Not only that, but therapists can help clients develop sound tools and techniques to be better equipped to handle a wide range of problems in their future. It’s literally just helping you develop as a person. You can go to the gym and have trained people help you develop a plan based on your physical needs. You can also stay at home and workout by yourself develop your own plan. If you’re not a personal trainer then likelihood is you’ll get more out of going to the gym and assembling a plan with someone who is. It’s the same with therapy. You could stay at home and figure your problems out alone, but you can also speed up that process and find the best ways for you to navigate through those problems with someone who’s trained in those areas. There is absolutely no shame in doing that and I take great offence to you trying to place that shame onto people. 

As someone who claims to be sane and emotionally stable you obviously haven’t had therapy, so to just assume you know how it affects someone is very arrogant don’t you think? You’ve not even had any experience with what you’re talking about. I’ve been raped, sexually assaulted as a child, suffered domestic abuse and physical injury. Talking therapy has allowed me to speak about things that I didn’t for 9 years, in a safe space where I won’t be judged and the aim of the talk is primarily to heal. I have absolutely no shame in that it absolutely has helped me, so you are wrong. And just because some really shitty people decided to abuse me doesn’t mean I’m incapable of making voting decisions. 

It comes across as if you think everyone who goes to therapy or has mental health issues is bat shit crazy and impossible of making decisions without them being irrational or ‘unstable’. This is real life not the movies. I think it would shock you to know that most people with mental health issues you probably come into contact with on a daily basis and wouldn’t even know. Because they’re manageable, because they don’t always affect every aspect of people’s lives and because people aren’t *just* their mental illness and shouldn’t be defined as such or discriminated against by trying to take things like their right to vote away from them.  

If I can get a degree in a field that is quite difficult and does require a level of good education to get into, then I’m clearly not incapable of using logic and not letting my mental health issues cloud everything I do. 

You are wrong Sir, you are also offensive and you are also placing shame where it doesn’t need to be placed.

Medications don’t always help, and unless needed for function, should be a last resort. Talking therapy does a lot for people.

People lose children, have phobias of spiders, snakes, heights, others lose mobility in accidents and struggle with this, some people are abused, some have personality disorders, some live in very rough neighbourhoods, the list goes on. To imply that such people are somehow less than for needing help with these things is ignorant of you to put it nicely. To make out like these are simple things that you *should* be able to handle yourself without needing a therapist, is absurd. Your statement is overly generalised, ill-informed and very discriminating."
