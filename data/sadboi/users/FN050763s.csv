indonesia,etoyct7,t3_ccojwo,1563040795.0,"ini baru banget gue ulas di sebuah olatform Quora, copas aja ya:

I just got dropped off by my Gojek ride from work. The driver struck a conversation with me, and said that he’s currently on his thesis for his clinical psychology bachelor degree–– but it’s been six-years since he started his bachelor program because he has to juggle a family and working as a Gojek driver.

I’m typically very uninterested in idle chit-chats with strangers, but he really got my attention. He started asking me questions about the basis of every relationship according to my point of view, and this led to another conversation to Freudian theory. This conversation got very interesting as I don’t usually talk much about theories and whatnots since I’m pretty much a clown to everyone around me.

I really wanted to help him with his thesis, so during the ride, I told him I’m going to give him a miss-call and he could feel free to go on with the chat through WhatsApp–– alas, he said that he ran out of data because he’s been broke for quite a while, and therefore, he can only accept calls.

Although tipping isn’t culturally mandatory in Indonesia, the app enables us to tip our drivers from our credit. Without further thinking, I tipped him the most amount out of the options given, and anonymously bought him the biggest data package available from Tokopedia added to his phone number so he can surf the web to do further research for his thesis.

I usually hate talking about the “good deeds” that I’ve done for someone because I find it distasteful to brag about the good that you’ve done–– but it was a very interesting ride for me, and I wish it lasted longer, and that was how much I appreciated the conversation I had with him. I bet it took him some guts to ask his passengers to participate on his research–– but nonetheless, he was very non-intrusive about it and he was rather polite.

I hope the extra tip and the data package are going to be useful for him to go further on his thesis. I really do."

toastme,etervss,t3_cbdmpr,1562744067.0,"My email sent to my HR department is as follow:

Hi everyone,

I'm sorry for the suuuuuper late notice. I've been trying to wait it out to feel better and I prefer to keep the reason of my WFH today rather hush-hush since I'm not comfortable opening up about the actual reason to others. There's been something triggering issue lately, and I'm currently having a mild-moderate anxiety attack since last night. Worry not, though, I can still get my work done at a usual pace–– in fact, it helps keeping me distracted although being in a public space would be rather overwhelming right now which I feel pretty fair enough the fact that Faustina isn't in and I have no shoot today, and an isolated place right now enables me to be more productive and get more work done–– so being in a WFH situation for the moment would outweigh in terms of productivity (I can get a lot more work done as per this situation) as for my current situation as much as I want to come in for work and immerse myself in a totally different environment and joke around with everyone else as usual... but unfortunately, putting up such ""cheerful"" mask is rather emotionally taxing more that I'd like it to be at the moment; on the other hand, if I come in looking not-as-cheerful as my usual being, I'm afraid that people are going to start to suspect that I'm not in my peak mental state.

(Oh God I'm tearing up as I'm writing this email for letting myself being so vulnerable which ever barely occurs, but I feel comfortable enough to share it with you guys 😢) 

Worry not–– I've been internalizing with addressing the emotions that I'm currently feeling. Big whoop, I'm notorious for shunning my emotions at its early onset since we've all been indoctrinated to demonize any negative sentiments–– therefore, the pragmatic approach I so, so like to push into myself in attempt to shun negative emotions away is currently backfiring to myself as per now and I feel some cathartic feelings seeping through. Something rather personal that I have to deal with myself and probably get out of the habit of keeping things to myself and let it accumulate–– which is rather unhealthy.

Actually, I'm not even sure if what I'm feeling right now is totally justified or is it just me going deep into the rabbit hole with one presumptuous thought leading up to another to even mess with me further. For the moment, I'm just grateful to have you guys to be–– what I perceive, correct me if I'm wrong–– a few of the people that I feel comfortable in sharing about some of these things and not being judgmental about it, as well being grateful for having this particular job desc that can be done as effectively (if not more in this specific case) being done remotely or not.

I'm going to address some of the misconception that may surface after pouring my heart out conveyed in this email that I'm generally an optimistic, joie-de-vivre kind of person and I am not typically just putting out a cheerful front for the sake of pretending to be a happy person. I really am–– but today and the last couple of days hasn't been it.

Also, worry not–– for all I know (or would like to know), I'm relatively fast at bouncing back from my blue moments.

Thank you for listening (i.e. reading) this whole thread of me being all vulnerable and the lack of objective reasoning to excuse myself out of the office today. I know this email is rather uncalled for and I might be giving out more information than necessary. I'm trying to be completely honest rather than just disappearing and giving some false excuse to be out of the office today–– so I decide to break out of my comfort zone and be as open as possible about my real cause in avoidant to be in a public space right now.

If this is not a legitimate excuse for not being in the office, don't hesitate to let me know and I'll definitely take that into account and would introspect upon it.

I'm sorry for rather letting myself succumb into this anxiety attack where it hinders me to be present in the office today. I'm open to sharing what is going on that leads to my present mental state (perhaps not publicly, just between us), but first of all, I'm going to get as much work done as possible–– which is good for me because it prevents me from succumbing further into irrational negative train of thoughts.

A favor to ask, though, if someone asks where I am today, please just tell them that my back-pain is taking its flare?

Thank you so, so much for hearing me out, and I hope you guys are having a great day ahead! If you need to reach me out, please reply to this thread or DM me through Instagram as I'm trying to minimize from appearing Online in WhatsApp... although I am not going to be on social media today as it's sort of triggering. 

Again, thank you so, so much! You have no idea how grateful I am to even have this platform to open up,

INTP,et9jten,t3_cah5ub,1562598636.0,"Actually I’m only socially awkward when I’m not recharged whatsoever— but even then,  it’s not as much as awkward, more like less talkative than usual and more absorbed into whatever I’m doing at that moment.

I’m a pretty big introvert— and this is such a foreign concept for people around me because I come off pretty bold and whenever I brush them off by saying that “oh, haha, I really like solitude though”, they’d usually just tell me right off “well I don’t claim to be an introvert and everyone needs their downtime”. Needless to say, I don’t argue further on those types of conversation and just let it go. Haha. 

I’d say I’m pretty confident— I know what I know, and I know what I don’t know. And for being an INTP, I go get sucked into so much reading and learning, and learned how to present an argumentation well— therefore, when I’m firm with my opinion, I’m especially meticulous in picking the words that would best deliver my point with a conviction. This contributes on sounding confident. When I’m not 100% confident about knowing something, I’d usually start my sentences with words such as “I believe”, “as far as I know”, “I feel that”, and stuff like that— you get the idea— and I’d end it with “prove me wrong in this if you disagree”. 

Regardless, I don’t argue as a sport, though, but I’m generally not a self-doubting person. I’d like to think that I’m pretty self-aware and I know that I’m likeable enough— for those who don’t— then there’s just simply not enough chemistry for us, and it’s not something I’d like to force. I’m your typical INTP that isn’t typically succinct in casual conversations, and therefore, I have the tendency to branch out upon carrying on the conversation. I also have genuine curiosity on others’ perspectives, so that bit also keep conversations smooth. I actually won an actual award for being “The Greatest Showman” in my company— I work in a creative agency, where everyone is generally under some sort of pressure and people become high-strung and stuff.

Since I barely ever panic, I’m mostly pretty upbeat and unfazed by stressors here and there, because I’m confident that doing my humanly best is enough and there’s no need for me to fulfill a preconceived expectation. If I am proven to not being able to sort out the problem over and over again despite my best effort, I will present factual record and present data in regards to the concern and I negotiate with my bosses what can be done to troubleshoot this: more manpower needed? Adjustments on KPI? Managing their expectations? What I know is that panicking wouldn’t solve the problem.

This might provide some insights on some more assertive INTPs might behave in their daily basis. Being my authentic self has generally been seen as a breathe of fresh air for having boundless taste in humor and being a natural creative on my own. And of course, I test as an INTP-A. 😆"
INTP,et9hdvp,t3_cakf5n,1562596953.0,"I usually get too lazy to do my makeup to work so I look like a shitbag on daily basis— but there was one particular time when my office was really cold, and I just jammed into every outers that weren’t worn by my coworkers and put all my hair up in a sloppy ponytail.

One of my coworker: “Wow you look like shit today”
Me: “IKR”

I think that part says a lot— at least about me. 🤷‍♀️

Once you get to my actual home, I have way more skincare products, makeup stash, and the so much clothes. But I don’t even go out. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️"
retouching,et2f6m6,t1_espd2af,1562415907.0,"Excuse me while I’ve had FMCG clients to fashion editorials, ranging from Unilever to Elle. I’ve shot from from plain banal billboard, dramatic company profile shots, social media assets, to experimental tearsheets. 

This particular one is for an FMCG drugstore skincare line that has been my repeat client throughout the years, so whether the end result suits to my taste and definitely yours are irrelevant— it’s definitely not marketed towards a demography of mine, but if my work has been deemed profitable for their target audience and it’s been one of the sources of my income, why should they risk of experimenting with another photography vendor, and why should I not comply to their brief catered to their needs?

Aside from that, the final images themselves are 50% of what factors them into hiring me repeatedly. Hiring a photographer require intense interaction for quite a while, from pre-production up until the revisions are over and the deliverables are all done.

So you’re partially right— my work may be nothing special and someone can easily replace me— if not better or cheaper. The fact that my clients find me pleasant to work with and the fact that I’ve been ethical also factor into their decision making in getting the bang for their bucks.

I really tried to ignore the aggression, but I feel like I should stand up for myself for once."
adultery,et2b5u3,t3_c9eryr,1562414050.0,"I’m a 26 MF and I’m not in a situation where adultery is relevant to my current marriage. However, I have a friend in the exact same situation as I have mentioned in one of the commenter’s responses. She’s been married with a guy that she sees as her soulmate, and she would never, ever leave him. She loves him to the moon and back, and they have been together for 8 years and counting.

Prior to her relationship, she had seen this one guy before, let’s call him Jake. The relationship, though, didn’t extend to an official relationship. Her current SO came along, and they got together up until now and they have a son together.

They’ve had their share of up-and-downs, but they remain to be in love with each other. Nothing has ever reduced, but their sex life is currently nill. She’s an HL, while he’s an LL.

My friend and Jake recently reconnected as they were still friends on Twitter, and if I’m not mistaken, a tweet led to a conversation, and it led them further. The attraction was instantaneous for them, and apparently, it had never been truly gone for both of them even though they hadn’t interacted for years. They mutually have feelings really similar to what you had described with your AP, and Jake is currently engaged to another girl and is about to get married a few months from now.

I never doubted her feelings towards both her SO and Jake when she was telling me all about this. Her and I have been coworkers for a while now, but she’s a very reserved girl, so we’ve only became close friends recently, and we’ve confided on things with each other upon finding out that we’re on the same thought frequency, and are open-minded and non-judgmental about things that can’t otherwise be understood by anyone else. I’ve been supportive towards whatever decision that my friend is making. She’s an adult that consents to her actions, and nonetheless, she has a heart of gold, fully self-aware, and also very intelligent. 

In her case, she had been open to her SO about her sexual frustration due to his LL. They both are also very open about their thoughts, so one day after the affair had started, she brought up the conversation about the possibility of having a polyamorous relationship to her SO. 

She told him that she would never be able to let go of him, and she described him as her anchor— no matter who she might be attracted to, he’d still be the one she comes home to. She told him that she can’t imagine her life without him, but she also finds that she’s capable of having multiple love-interests... and that it wouldn’t, in any way, reduce the sentiments she have towards him.

She said that she’s no longer capable of feeling jealousy towards her SO, because she trusts that her SO feels the same way towards her.

Her SO responded that he had never thought about having multiple partners at that moment. If she wanted to, she could go ahead and take a go on another relationship— but don’t tell him about it. She then responded that it would take the essence of having a polyamorous relationship— she wants it to be 100% consensual, and she’d technically be “cheating” if she has an AP that her SO doesn’t know about— even if her SO actively chose not to know about it.

Until now, her bond with Jake still goes on while keeping the marriage harmonious. She keeps her SO in the dark about Jake’s existence, because he has yet to reciprocate my friend’s concept of having a polyamorous relationship in the way she wants him to be— therefore, she’s in a moral dilemma right now. She doesn’t feel bad about how much she’s attracted to Jake— she believes that it’s something she can’t fight off— therefore, she’s just going with the motion to stay this way unless otherwise. 

Granted, we’re still— for lack of better words— kids who are half your age. I’m in no way experienced in having had a relationship for over three-years, and I’ve never had it in me to be in love with more than one person. This comment is definitely not in any way an advice; I also can’t say that I understand because I haven’t been in that position. I’m probably just writing an unstructured paragraphs of rambling in accordance to your situation because it reminds me so much of my friend.

I really hope that you both find a closure to the situation— or if closure isn’t something that you seek for, just know that there’s a stranger out here who hadn’t been in your situation (me), yet is supportive and 100% validates your situation. ❤️"
adultery,et25d5f,t1_esxi1yi,1562411293.0,"Only in this sub to read on another perspective as I’m an MF 26 myself, and I can’t even imagine myself having the slightest feeling for none other than my SO. One of my close friends, however, is in OP’s exact situation, an MF 28 (dormant sex life with her SO that she has a soulmate-like, BFF connection with, yet a magnetic-like attraction with this guy that had just gotten engaged to another girl).

This comment deserves an award because empathy is exactly what OP needs. I wish polyamory were feasible to those who feel this way, though... while I can’t imagine myself being in love with two people at the same time, the concept of polyamorous relationship doesn’t make less sense for those who are able to. I believe that some people have the capacity to be in love with more than one person in which each respective relationship carries different dynamic than the other(s); and yes, love can’t be quantified, so assuming that such situation would ultimately come down to having to choose either one is such an oversimplification of their reality.

Kinda wish that polyamorous love is acknowledged as another sex orientation— it’s not for everyone, but it really does exist."

retouching,espdhqq,t1_espd0a0,1562182683.0,it’s a common practice for where I’m from to have a wardrobe stylist to customize the whole outfit after they take the talent’s measurements. Never shot a commercial in other country so IDK if they just specifically look for the wardrobe based on the PPM and sorta work around that.

retouching,esorizi,t1_esop52k,1562173028.0,"Different strokes for different folks? I specialize in beauty and fashion both editorial and commercial and rarely gotten jobs that require some heavy compositing, and I guess it depends on what I aim to do. In this case, masking rather suits me more, just like whenever someone ask me why I’m not using a tablet or some sort of mouse instead. There had barely been any instance where I got a revision for adjustment layer spilling over the background that I didn’t notice, but I also didn’t intend to make any change on the background here and not a lot of dodging and burning (as per client request— they may change the background themselves with their in-house employee, but not that I know of)— just needed to get rid of some stray hair and tidy up the floor texture. There had been some work that required me with no choice other than to completely isolate the model and to re-draw the hair strands so it wouldn’t look “cut up”, but this one isn’t it.

But thanks for your input!"
