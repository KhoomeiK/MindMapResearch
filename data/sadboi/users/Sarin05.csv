Sometimes I even feel a sting in my heart. It's kinda ironic. I don't know if hugging helps, but I hope you are not lonely for long. I wish you anything you need."

depression,evael0z,t3_ciyudx,1564345784.0,"It's great of you for being supportive and not pushing. Being the partner of someone with depression and even anxieties is a lot of work and energy draining, but I hope for you it's rewarding, meaning she notices it in a good way and appreciates all that.
It's okay to feel tired of all the negative-thought-loops she might have, I think all of my past partners were tired of all this too. Maybe in a year or 2 it stops or just lessens.
All I want to say is, i think it's rare for someone in your position to stay this patient. I want to thank you for that. I hope I'll someday find a partner who is as caring and understanding as you are.
Stay strong, as she will get better, your relationship will too.
I wish both of you all the best."
depression,erbl3za,t3_anh7tv,1560685333.0,"I had my second breakup recently, it wasn't a long relationship but with the first one betraying me and the second one not having enough feelings for me, left a very sour taste on my overall depressed and anxious mind.
She said I had too many demons floating around and I should concentrate on that first. I felt like a statist in her life even if we tried as friends...
Two months I threw myself in a pit in my mind on a daily basis.
A friend I am really grateful for asked me if I would like a weekend of at his'. My mind cooled down as I clearified for myself that it was over with her, I wouldn't see her anymore and that gave me some strength to try dealing with my problems.
I now feel like I'm in my own film again and I hope this feeling stays for a while.
Now I concentrate on fixing me, I'm going on therapy and I try taking time for writing.
Knowing that my first breakup was way harder keeps me going.
My problems might be small as I read what others have to fight with, but for me it felt like being at an edge. Now I'm hoping for better times."
