TwoXChromosomes,fqx7vp8,t1_fqwoakl,1589727728.0,"Growing up I personally didnt have great examples of healthy relationships. Mom is an antagonistic uberlover (strange combination I know) and my dad is a stage 5 clinger with daddy issues. I remember plates being thrown, I remember crying a lot and I remember constantly loading up the car to leave one of mothers many abusive partners throughout the years and then unloading it when they made up an hour later. Since I mostly lived with my mom, i had a Disney/high school view of love. I thought that anyone struggling or having a difficult time was just down on their luck and needed every bit of love and support from me! But I didnt DARE expect that kind of stuff in return. Because people pleasing became an identity. If a relationship didnt work out i was terrified people would call me a slut because my mom would scream at me from ""jumping boyfriend to boyfriend"". In reality she thought ALL relationships were worth sticking around for until they ended in hating one another. In fact I broke up with a boyfriend in high school that my mom liked. She sat us down and ""mediated"" until I agreed it wasnt actually over. I was taught to love. But in an unhealthy way. I'm still learning how to love someone the right way and to accept that I'm worthy of the same."
