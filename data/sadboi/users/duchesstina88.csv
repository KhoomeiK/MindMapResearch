inuyasha,fqpzh5s,t1_fqkiki4,1589556775.0,She did find peace. I guess my nephew meant when she was alive 50 years back. Not that he has seen many episodes to understand she was long dead
KikyoFromInuyasha,fqpz2xk,t3_giawyt,1589556576.0,Inuyasha could have done it too. Lol. That decision didn't end well for her sadly
inuyasha,fqjvfj4,t1_fqjuva3,1589415773.0,"I know. Both are experienced, emotionally matured, good looking as f and powerful. I guess Rumiko said in her interviews that  woman like Kikyo would be the ideal match for him"
inuyasha,fqjl618,t1_fqj1eeh,1589411512.0,I know right. Very interesting idea though. Major drama
inuyasha,fqh0avv,t1_fqfcqd8,1589363391.0,"She underestimated both, Naraku and the power of the jewel shard which led to her final death. She could have just kept the jewel shards with herself, no? Why give to Naraku"
inuyasha,fqh047w,t1_fqg4ezf,1589363205.0,"A part of me thought,  she didn't want inuyasha to complete the jewel. Maybe because he would wish upon to be a full demon. But then she could have kept the stolen shards with herself. Why handover to Naraku"
KikyoFromInuyasha,fqgyle5,t3_gip03e,1589361665.0,I was listening to it just yesterday. So much pain and love in that song
inuyasha,fqeqf72,t1_fqenkuu,1589311885.0,Even Kanna says the same thing in one of the episodes that the light in the jewel will kill Naraku. Is it the purification spec of light left by kikyo?
inuyasha,fqeq86t,t1_fqenej6,1589311792.0,"I like Kikyo, but this made me laugh. Agreed, she wasn't powerful in her revived form, but why wait till the jewel was complete. Serves little to no purpose"
KikyoFromInuyasha,fqdgqnj,t3_ge4vq1,1589289303.0,"Her character was so above everyone else. Insane amounts of maturity. I too believe, she knew she was going to die. But, with fewer jewel shards remaining (only 1 in the end), she decided to give it her all. I really wished, she was the one who killed Naraku."
depression,fpt9kc4,t3_gfbg6r,1588887257.0,"I feel you. I don't think I have ever had anyone who loved me back. So, I have no hope of finding special someone or even making connections with people or friends"
inuyasha,fpsdhga,t3_gf4jnx,1588871626.0,"It feels so too. His mobility, sword techniques, poison sting seem to be compromised when he turns into his true form. But, I think it's balanced out by immense increase in strength. It's just never properly portrayed in the anime"
inuyasha,fpscn6a,t1_fps8cf3,1588871221.0,"Makes sense. She thought, she is the only one who can defeat him.  Which was true as Sesshomaru didn't have Bakuseiga and Inuyasha the meido. I think, she would have healed better and put an end to Naraku if she was with the group. Wanted her to witness his death"
inuyasha,fpsbizl,t1_fprydr7,1588870687.0,"I just feel, she could have been there and witnessed Naraku's end if she stayed with the group. Her untimely death the second time, saddens me"
inuyasha,fpsb7vw,t1_fprrd79,1588870541.0,"I agree. Kohaku was reminded of all the painful past and didn't wish to be with Sango. But, these were desperate times. Kikyo knew she was not completely recovered from the wounds inflicted from Naraku's miasma. He would absolutely be coming for Kohaku. I just can't help think that if she had joined the gang, Kagome would have even purified her and maybe she would not have to die before killing Naraku.

None of them know I suffer from depression and I always used to fake my way through it. I think most of the times, you can only form those connections earlier on. I am used to moving on, I have changed cities and even countries(briefly). But everyone else seems to be busy with other people. It hurts when however you try, it's never going to matter"
depression,fpmmvww,t1_fpm7s5n,1588736631.0,"Me too. But I honestly try to be best friends and give them all they want. I have anxiety too, so it's not always easy. Over time, I realized, they are never ever there for me. Can't blame them at all. Why deal with a pile of mess like myself"

CitrusManga,foo9ns2,t1_fomjjst,1587935161.0,Added to wishlist. Slow burners are fine. If the story is great. Thanks
CitrusManga,foo9g20,t1_foo0cj5,1587935061.0,Yup Girlfriends is good too. Whispered words has been on my wishlist and I will give it a read. The reason I said citrus like manga/anime is because I wanted both characters to explore their feelings. I enjoyed the drama when Yuzu and Mei are both struggling with their feelings in the initial chapters. Makes it more relatable. One of the characters already being a lesbian makes me slightly disinterested. Good art is a bonus too.
CitrusManga,fommr2i,t1_fomindx,1587895964.0,But why would she? I definitely wouldn't move if Mei were to kiss me :D
CitrusManga,fomfy6o,t1_fomflfb,1587888593.0,"Read what does the fox say too. I liked it. But,  I am in need something like citrus. Where they actually explore their feelings. Brings back a lot of memories. Can't get that different kiss video out of my mind since weeks"

alcoholism,fog6le6,t3_g71s7c,1587748579.0,"Same. A few months back, I only had a few beers left and I thought I would have them and stop. 3 beers down, I was out at the liquor store buying more. Alcohol interferes with your judgement and I have no control over myself after a point. So abstinence was the only thing working for me"

depression,fo0enmc,t1_fnz54n4,1587411734.0,Makes complete sense to me. It's just that I feel miserable I have wasted all of my teenage and early 20s  not getting even 1% of all of that. I wish to have hope it's just tough
Anxiety,fnysrbx,t1_fnyovt6,1587374276.0,I clench my teeth in public. And shake my head really weirdly. As if I am shivering. I think our mind just wants that stress to escape somehow. And it comes off physically

Anxiety,fny6zmo,t1_fny3xeh,1587354960.0,"My roommate used to ask me to not stress about it. I was like 'Ofcourse, never thought of that'  . After a stressful event, anything is enough to trigger it. Even while watching netflix, working on something or the deadliest -my own thoughts"
Anxiety,fnxo4fi,t3_g4hgcb,1587342743.0,"All the time. I cringe or my shoulders tense up. Either I end up screaming something or saying something out loud to get go of it. When my anxiety peaks, it's worse. I will end up doing that 5-6 times in a night. It sucks man. You are not alone"
alcoholism,fnwvt1s,t3_g4buxg,1587326428.0,"I had the same question for this group today. I got to hear from my colleagues and a few friends that I was a complete mess on 2-3 occasions. My anxiety won't let me deal with it well. I said something hurtful and yelled at a friend who had just lost a family member. I have no recollection of them what so ever. All these events happened 6-7 months back. Right now, I don't know how to fix this? They don't talk to me as before and some just chose to ask me everytime if I am already drunk before they talk about anything. Both of which sucks. Because I am trying to be sober since the past 5 months. Relapsed twice though"
KikyoFromInuyasha,fnwuy10,t3_g4ddv5,1587325949.0,"I agree. Kikyo is experienced and has far more emotional maturity than most of the other characters. One reason, Kikyo wanted to drag Inuyasha with her to hell was because she felt betrayed(by both, life and love) and she knew avenging Naraku won't bring her back. I still believe, when she handed over the shikon no tama to Naraku, a part of her knew that she is the only one powerful enough to destroy him. This is back when Inuyasha and Kagome still hadn't become mighty enough. I can't blame her, she did nothing wrong. She did an amazing job when she was incharge of protecting the sacred jewel, she sacrificed all the things normal women her age would do(one exception), loved someone deeply and all of which led to her untimely demise. When she was revived, the sacred jewel she died protecting was back in the feudal era, the guy she truly loved is still alive with pretty much someone else and her existence is temporary. She gave so much to get so little in return"
depression,fn7vugw,t1_fn7r28t,1586728667.0,"When people talk about the fun they had at the movies, shopping or hiking, it hurts me so bad. It's like a milestone reached if I gather the energy and motivation to get out of bed and take a shower."

depression,fn794fe,t3_g00s64,1586715704.0,"Me too. I feel horrible for harboring such feelings. I envy  them so much. I am either sad, self loathing or awkward. So unfair. I wish to be happy too."
depression,fn78pal,t3_g01oo9,1586715469.0,"I hear you. My loneliness has peaked during this quarantine. I have made peace with the fact that no one is ever going to love me. Don't blame them, I don't like a single thing about myself either. And having this stupid hope has just lead to unwarranted pain over the years. But I can't give up on that. That's the only thing I have left. Please stay strong. We are here for you"
KikyoFromInuyasha,fmvejjt,t1_fl1d8di,1586414264.0,I was thinking of doing the same. Why did they take it down? Bummer
KikyoFromInuyasha,fmve3zs,t3_fwowkf,1586413850.0,"Commented this on another similar post : I loved this. I guess the best person would be Sesshomaru. They both have a lot of similar qualities. I would never want to see her with Naraku, even though I sympathized with him in the end. As far as adorable Kagaome is concerned, since she is her reincarnation, won't it be like loving yourself?
One more person, I guess I will ship her with is human Inuyasha. Then she can finally live in peace."

inuyasha,fmml2lq,t3_fvq96b,1586207235.0,"I don't like Naraku. But, I do sympathize with him. From my perspective, Naraku(Oniguma) and Inuyasha start off the same way. Both love the same woman. Whom couldn't have. After formation of Naraku and early on in the series,  both wish to get rid of their human side to become a powerful demon. Thankfully, adorable Kagome heals the wounds inflicted on Inuyasha. However, Naraku gives in to his resentment and starts destroying relationships. Naraku goes through so much to get rid of his human heart, whereas Inuyasha starts accepting it. In the very end Naraku ends with nothing. The fact that he wished upon the shikon no tama for Kikyo's heart after everything, made me sympathize with him. His ways were undoubtedly wrong, but I felt sad, all he wanted was her"
depression,fmmk1fc,t1_fmmjqo1,1586206688.0,I have searched multiple times if there is something like alcohol which is not as bad as it. But there's nothing. We just need to slowly work each day to be the person we are after a few beers
alcoholism,fmmci4j,t3_fw3is5,1586202810.0,"Hey I feel the exact same way. I suffer from depression and social anxiety. So alcohol made me this super amazing person who would take on challenges and have a happy productive life. What it did on the contrary was peak my anxiety and build up my guilt as everything alcohol showed me was a facade. I know it's tough. I relapsed once within being 4 months sober. It was enough to bring back all the guilt and anxiety. Not worth it. As other mentioned, just baby steps at first. Motivation will follow and productivity will increase"
depression,fmmblfq,t3_fvwsmq,1586202345.0,"I hear you man. I am the same. No personality whatsoever. My social anxiety always gets in the way of speaking up my mind too.

I am still not sure how to be firm on my opinion and have confidence in myself. But I know for sure alcohol is not the way."
inuyasha,fmijeqe,t1_fmieq53,1586110766.0,"Agree. Later in the series,Inuyasha and Kagome improve drastically. When she was alive, I envisioned her to be this ultra powerful priestess in charge of the shikon no tama( which even played Naraku in the end). Although she was a mortal, demons couldn't get to her. It's likely that she couldn have been easily killed (when she was alive) by a powerful blow from a demon. But that was never the case. I just wanted to witness the same when she is brought back into the living."
inuyasha,fmihqp4,t1_fmi82mp,1586109809.0,"I agree that her revived form isn't shown as powerful as the one in flashbacks. Probably because she isn't truly herself as she has to rely on soul collectors to once again walk among the living. But her unparalleled wisdom and experience make her a lethal opponent. A lot of the power Kagome draw is from her emotions imo. Love for Inuyasha, camaraderie, kindness etc which I truly adore. But Kikyo never had/allowed any of those. I just wish we had more scenes of her powers when she is revived. I loved the scene when she is full of confidence and laughs at Naraku owing to his inability to kill her."

But I was pretty successful and I only drank to have fun. Never impacted my work or responsibilities. I too have anxiety and that was a form of self medication. Fast forward 2 years, my anxiety is at its peak. I started to miss work owing to my binges and I continue making mistakes at work which cannot be excused. From social drinker,  I found myself making excuses to drink alcohol almost daily. I missed that high and the happiness which come after a bottle. But now, it's all full of guilt the next day.

That was the time I stopped. I wrote down the reasons for which I quit. Whenever I get the craving, I repeatedly read those reasons out to me. Which kind of helps.

depression,fc4qc8i,t3_eg4qv1,1577424602.0,I have always envied people who found the love of their lives and are happy. I want to be them. I envy the fact that i can't be that happy and they just seem to get things easy. I keep telling myself that my depression will go away if i have someone whom i truly love and they love me. I still haven't found them owing to my crippling anxiety and honestly have given up hope of finding someone too. Most of the people i have had a crush on didn't even knew i exist.
alcoholism,fbwe43l,t3_eequ48,1577147511.0,Hey I used to party almost every weekend for the past 2 years. I quit drinking a few weeks back. But i always get peer pressured whenever i am out(because that's what they know me for). I tried avoiding situations all together but that doesn't help during holidays. Also i am not comfortable telling them about my alcoholism. The excuse i use it that i am receiving eczema treatment and cannot drink alcohol as it will aggravate my symptoms. Hope that helps

Anxiety,fbfsumf,t1_fbfrabj,1576819841.0,"I am making a doc's appointment over the weekend. I have embarrassed myself in meetings thrice now and i am afraid I will lose my job now. Does it help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety? I have shaky hands and voice, also i think my heart is going to pound off my chest :("
