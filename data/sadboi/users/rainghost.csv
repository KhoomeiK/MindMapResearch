The main differences between Dark Iron dwarves and Ironforge Dwarves is **not** skin color. There are gray-skinned Ironforge dwarves and you can create one yourself right now. They have different cultures, with Dark Irons behaving very differently from Ironforge and Wildhammer Dwarves. You should do the quests in Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes, as well as the Dark Iron allied race recruitment quests, to see these differences! 

You can learn more about primary sources here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source

Primary sources are the original source of information. In WoW's case, this would be the official Warcraft games and their associated novels. A wiki, which can be edited at any time by any one, will never be a reliable source of information. I could edit the Orc wiki page right now to say they're made of green jell-o, and anyone relying on that page as a valid source would be led to believe that was true. 

You have not yet given 'proofs' that Peons can be considered a sub-race of Orcs. Please provide a primary source for this claim.

My proof to the contrary is this: The video game World of Warcraft.

In World of Warcraft, you can see with the eyes that are located in the front of your face that peons are not a separate culture or species from regular orcs. They have a different 3D model, but so do peasants for humans, and those are not some sort of bizarre 'subrace'. For example, Gerald Green in Farshire in Borean Tundra (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gerald_Green) looks very different from other human NPCs in the game, but you can't take that as proof that he's part of some sort of human subrace. He looks physically different, but that is not enough to classify him as the progenitor of some sort of ""fat human"" subrace.

Good luck in your efforts to learn more about the reliability of sources!"

Actual subraces = Wildhammer, Ironforge, and Dark Iron Dwarves. Forest, Dark, Ice Trolls. Etcetera.

Orcish peons are Orcs. They're not part of a subrace. They look different from normal orcs, but are not a subrace in and of themselves. Otherwise a Human peasant would be their own subrace, and obese night elves would be a subrace, and dark-skinned gnomes would be a subrace - because they look very different to the 'normal' examples of their kind.

Also, I believe I already asked for one, but you haven't provided one - do you have any primary sources? All I've seen so far are wikis, which are not primary sources.

I'm so glad I clicked onto Korone's face when it showed up in the sidebar. I was watching Kizuna Ai, she was the only vtuber I was really aware of. I remember that in the past (2-ish years ago) I had found my way onto other 'vtuber' videos but those were basically just a 3D model of a cat's face overlaid over game footage while a text to speech voice spoke, and that didn't exactly capture my imagination, so I kind of wrote everyone besides Kizuna Ai off.

Luke Skywalker was a **character** - we watched him grow and change.

We see him abandon his training with Yoda because his friends are in danger, even though Yoda warns him that he's nowhere near ready to survive a battle with Darth Vader. He manages to survive, he redeems his father, and he saves the galaxy...for a couple decades, then the Empire and the Emperor just show up again.

Rey is a **trope**. She first appears in the desert, squinting into the sun, strong and resolute and independent. Then she fights a lot of bad guys, looking very strong and resolute and independent, and at the end of the final movie she walks off into the desert looking very strong and resolute and independent.

It's a really important part of the story, because in the Living Story you're basically rolling with a certain crew of allies and in Season 2 you're suddenly part of an entirely different group of characters, with no explanation why!

So I got excited about returning to the game after being gone since I missed Season 1.

But then it turns out that the missing plot points are only returning in the form of flashbacks that take place in the middle of the Season 5 storyline. So new players and players who just want to have a complete storyline experience still just have to experience that major plot hole right between the end of the core story and the start of Season 2. It's only when they get to the newest story content in Season 5 that the game is like ""hey, here's how you met those people that suddenly were your squad in season 2"".

I have such a love/hate relationship with Arenanet.

MMORPG,fonoaqf,t3_g8gcxx,1587923282.0,"I personally prefer WoW to other MMOs, but I know that there are a lot of people who don't find it especially thrilling to play but stay there for a couple reasons.

The first is, like you said, friends that play.

The second is because so many MMO players already have a ton of time invested into the game, and investing similarly large amounts of time into other MMOs can feel unappealing.

That's what stops me from 'maining' another game for more than like 3 to 4 weeks. Okay, so I'm here in FFXIV or ESO or SWTOR, I *could* do this quest to go to a camp of enemies and kill a bunch of them and click on some boxes of stolen supplies to bring back to the quest guy. Or I could do the same thing on WoW, on my character that I made back in 2009.

I *could* look for a group in FFXIV/ESO/SWTOR to go down into this cave and fight these spider monsters and the four bosses of the spider people...or I could do the same thing on WoW, on my character that I've put over a thousand hours into over the past decade.

Other MMOs just don't offer enough of a different experience. Some of them have more voice acting and cutscenes, others give you 'action combat' that (in my opinion) usually ends up being more of a clunky hindrance than traditional tab-targeting MMO combat.

Pretty much anything you can do in any other MMORPG, you can do in WoW, and on one of the characters you've had for years and years and years."

MMORPG,folg00b,t1_folf1ta,1587861423.0,"That's weird, I always found WoW's zones to be pretty massive, apart from the original old world zones. I remember the first time I stepped into Hellfire Peninsula and I could see for miles. That was incredible, even at 8 frames per second on my 2003 Era PC. I also loved all the incentives to explore, like treasure chests and rare mobs.

GW2's zones always kind of reminded me of Assassin's Creed and other Ubisoft games - you get given a map with a lot of little icons on it, and you have to visit them all to fill up a 100% completion bar."

CrackWatch,fohdref,t1_fohai63,1587764259.0,"The whole game, including the expansions, have been finished. It's 100% feature complete.

What it isn't, however, is 100% bug-free. The base game is in pretty good shape but some of the stuff from Tribunal and Bloodmoon is basically held together by bubble gum and duct tape. The content is there but unless you get very lucky, you're going to have to use console commands to solve some problems in quest advancement. This is about as good as things are going to get since the mod's main developers pretty much left as soon as the base game was finished. It's a miracle that the remaining team even finished the expansions. I personally love Morroblivion but it's not for people who are enraged by bugs. A lot of folks don't like it and are waiting for Skywind, which might be out by the end of the decade if we're lucky."

What don't you like about Trooper?

I love Commando because they get to use Assault Cannons. I still get a kick out of planting my feet on the ground, spinning up my cannon, and raining hell on anyone foolish enough to stand before me. Plus you get to dress as a proto-Stormtrooper!

As for the class story, it can get a little formulaic since you're on a very long term mission to track down a handful of people, so you end up going after one and then the other and then the next and so forth. But that's the life of a soldier - you must complete your mission, no matter how impossible it seems or how long it might take. I enjoy stories about soldiers on the battlefield trying to figure themselves out and decide what loyalty and honor really mean, like Snake from Metal Gear. The Trooper story has a good amount of that, which makes me happy."
MMORPG,fo274nl,t3_g58s17,1587451858.0,"The people on this subreddit are very interesting. I get downvoted here a lot just for making game recommendations. People make threads asking what they should play next and list features they would like in their next MMO, I post a suggestion or two that fits their criteria, and a half hour later my comment has been downvoted three or four times.

People here have some very intense grudges against certain games and will downvote anyone who says anything nice about it or recommends it to someone looking for a new game. I haven't really seen that sort of behavior on any other gaming subreddits.

Of course getting downvoted isn't a big deal, but it just sort of underlines the general vibe on this subreddit. There's a whole lot of salt here."

I play MMOs to get immersed in a massive world, to explore and to learn more about its lore. I don't really cycle through the endgame loop very much - I find it kind of boring to repeat the same content on an almost daily basis.

Overwatch,fnpg7ss,t3_g32vqh,1587144953.0,"I remember about a year ago they nerfed ult charge across the board because people were starting to get sick of how the game basically revolved entirely around farming ult charge. Fights generally boiled down to which team had the most Qs to press.

That still happens now, but by nerfing ult charge rates they at least reduced the number of ults that could appear in a given match, which allowed for a little more non-ult gameplay in Overwatch.

Now with Echo we basically have a hero that can ult twice in a row, cannot actually be killed while doing so, and heals to full health afterwards.

I think the rest of her kit is fine but her ult has basically brought us back to the days of Ultwatch. >:("
