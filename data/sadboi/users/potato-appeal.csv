relationship_advice,f321nd7,t1_f320lr9,1570590731.0,My cat is really young still so I hope she does outgrow her impatience for when I‚Äôm sleeping. I‚Äôve tried playing before bed but it actually makes her meow a lot when I finally shut her out of our room. I shut her out because if I don‚Äôt she will stand on me when I‚Äôm sleeping and scream in my ear. But thank you for the idea about the heated bed! She loves my heating pad and can‚Äôt get enough of it. I might set it up on her favorite spot on the couch and hope for the best tonight.
