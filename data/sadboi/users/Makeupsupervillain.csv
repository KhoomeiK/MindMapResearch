I think you need to start working on how it makes you feel. You seem to be feeling shame, guilty, dirty & honestly, that’s how your rapist should feel - not you. 
You are not to blame here. No matter what you were doing or how many drinks. That shouldn’t have happened. 
You seem to need to talk. Get a therapist and cry. Don’t ever feel bad when you breakdown.
Some grounding techniques. I can post a lot of links and stuff. Let me know :) 
You can get through this. It’ll take time. Be patient with yourself & know that you are not alone. <3"

Religion to me, is the mind trying to figure things out, with the pieces it has. There are somethings in life that don’t have an answers; that even science can’t answer yet. My question to the world is “why did no one keep me safe as a child?” No one knows and my brain is just putting a bandaid called God on it but that’s ok, that’s what faith is - God- that comfort you spoke of. No one has answers for me but I want to find them in God - i may not find the answer to the question I pose but I think God is answering questions I don’t even know I have yet. Gods a “higher power” because sometimes you just need a loving fathers ear. It’s like meditation but I speak to a person from a book I read that resonated with me."

A few sexual assaults have made me have PTSD and just notice how hard life really is. It’s never sunshine and rainbows because people will always hurt you - I wanna not exist. Then I get medicine and therapy to help myself but still, I can’t keep a job, I don’t do well in school and I try...I do. I do all they tell me to down to the workbooks, groups, and I even start to open myself to people and bam ! It happened again last year.  I trusted and I started to be me again and I was reminded all I am; maybe that’s all I’m good for. All I have to offer is this body I hate so much because I’m no good for anything else. Time and time again. I fail. I fail to succeed, to chose right, and to protect myself; I am a failure in everything. I don’t self sabotage - I know what to do but the fear inside me is so great. The fear of being wanted by the wrong person again. I can’t concentrate on much, I obsess, I fear, and I’m always in my own mind.  Maybe it’s the head injuries I’ve cause myself - or the 10 years of being in this state which is why life is harder for me than others; maybe that’s my excuse & I’m purely just a failure with nothing to offer. I’m dead inside and out and I’m afraid I’m never gonna learn to love others or myself. I am in a hole right now & the rope to get out is ripping, the sun goes down above me and turns to night. No light to guide me. I thought I was free of myself - and yet here you are again. I just need a win.

I’m not lonely; I wanna be alone, with no one to bother me or for me to be afraid of.  I want no friends, when my immediate family is away - I don’t want cousins or anyone - I wanna disappear. I don’t want a connection to anyone except my dog.  I’d want a job I can do from home where I don’t ever have to leave. I don’t like making friends, being around them, or having to hang out with them; it’s a chore to me. I like my solitude and I think that people don’t understand that because they’re the lonely ones."
