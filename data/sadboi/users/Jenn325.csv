Teacher,fq4oil3,t1_fq4jh3v,1589080532.0,"I think the appropriateness depends on what she needs and what your school will allow. In my district, I do whatever I can to help my students take part in class without infringing on the education of others. I've had kids sit under tables, under my desk, next to me, on the floor, in the corner, behind a fabric ""wall"" strung between 2 filing cabinets...the list goes on! I try to think of what a specific child needs, or what I needed when feeling unsure as a child, and balance that with the distraction it may cause in the classroom. Sometimes it can be as simple as having a small stuffed animal from home, or something like a blanket that can be a surrogate hug from a trusted adult at home. 

I do wonder how she'd do if everyone were in her space. I wonder if you could set up a simple blanket fort (or tablecloths, or sheets) with tables and chairs for the group work. It could be put up and taken down with some ceremony so that it sets her up to begin that part of her routine. Again, you need to balance that with the distraction and excitement it will cause with the other kids, and with her reaction to having others in that space with her."

Teacher,fq4hh51,t3_ggqdnz,1589077811.0,"Would it be possible to set up the physical space so that she can sit under something while in the circle or small group? It sounds like that may give her a sense of safety, and she may get more out of the activities even if she doesn't verbally take part at first. I agree with Cesarswife that routine may be very important to her. For small children, the change in rules and expectations between caregivers (her foster and bio parents, for example) can be very stressful. Having a set system of gathering the kids, a specific order in which things are done, and consistent expectations may help her feel more secure in the small group space. If you're looking to get her to take part in the group, perhaps allowing her to pick out a favorite book to listen to, or a favorite toy to share may help? From what you said, it sounds like it will take her a while to feel comfortable taking part, but with a lot of patience it can happen."

Teacher,fmfqlvo,t3_fv0mcw,1586032805.0,"It really depends on where you teach. My district doesn't require teachers to submit lesson plans at all (however we are a very small, rural district, and everyone is pretty well aware of what's going on in other grades/rooms), but I have a friend who teaches in a state in the western part of the US that has to submit her plans for the entire semester (elementary school) and the district expects to be able to  look at her plans, walk into her room at any time during that semester, and have them match what is going on in the room at that moment. 

As far as the planning itself, I'm with you. I HATE writing lesson plans. However, I also realize that it makes me a much better teacher to have a clear path of where I'm going throughout a unit. After you've taught for a few years, you'll have units you're comfortable with and you'll be able to use the plans over again without more than the occasional tweak to keep them current for the students you're teaching. A lot of teachers use online planbooks to make those adjustments easier. I find that Google's G Suite for Education does everything I need it to, though.

Have you learned about backward planning? (You start at the end of the unit/lesson and work your way back to the beginning.) That is what works best for me, personally. It allows me to consider where my kids may get stuck, or where they may already have experience with the topic, and helps me to avoid beginning a lesson only to find out that it isn't what's needed at that moment. 

Good luck!"

I find that responding to cranky parents the way I respond to a cranky child usually does the trick. Let them vent. Commiserate with them about a bad situation. Then ask what you can do to help. A lot of them are just frustrated and scared, and are looking for some kind of ""authority figure"" to tell them what to do or that things will be all right. Good luck!!"

I teach 5th grade, but I taught this particular group last year in 4th grade, too. It's bittersweet. I'm so glad that I got that extra time with them, but oh, how I miss them! Everything is so unsettled right now, and I think that as teachers we're used to the role of being the adult in control who has the answers the kids need. Now we have parents looking to us for answers, too. The most you can do is listen to the parents and let them know that you're just as frustrated as they are. Keep in touch with your students as much as you can. Let them know that you miss them and love them and how heartbroken you are to be missing this part of your journey together. They're undoubtedly feeling many of the same things, and it will do them good to hear that it's normal and acceptable to feel that way.

As of today we're (Maine) going back to school April 27th, but I have a feeling that we're going to get a message eventually that we're done for the year. I want my kids to be safe. That's the most important thing. But I'm dreading that phone call."

The number of kids (10 yrs old) I hear saying that their goal in life is to drop out of school asap, have a kid, and go on welfare is staggering. But, that's the world they grew up in.

They might not turn out exactly the way you envision, but they will be okay. Try to live in the moment. Make only the decision that is right in front of you, but do it in a way that leads to you becoming fully you.
