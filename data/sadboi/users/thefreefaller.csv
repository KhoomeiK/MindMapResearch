I started smoking socially at 15, but once I was legal to buy my own (18 at the time) it went downhill from there. There was always a reason to smoke. Over the last year I noticed I was smoking a pack a day, and now more recently it’s been a pack and a half! I feel as though I’ve lost myself and smoking controls me now.

I’d like to get back in control again—hopefully this time next year I’ll be posting an update on how my new, smoke-free life has been!

Good luck to you and thanks again!"

I’ve been severely agoraphobic these past 5 years; I had dropped out of school after my first semester (with 3 gap years beforehand), left my first and only job after a month, and was confined to either my home or the hospital for majority of that time. I started getting better late 2019 and by January I made a plan to get my shit together.

I scheduled to retake my permit late February but it was closed that day, so I waited for another available day. As March crept around, everything began to close, then the “Stay at Home Order” was implemented, and now I’m back to my regular schedule of doing absolutely nothing. It kind of feels like the universe is out to get you, ya know?

Christianity,f3iuku7,t3_dh3qgb,1570942501.0,"I know the last thing you want to hear is, “I know what you’re going through,” because the truth is, I don’t. No one does. What you’re going through, whatever it may be, is unique—and whatever pain anyone else feels will be the same. I can only tell you that you’re not alone, because that’s the truth. Everyone suffers at some point—maybe years depending on the person or situation. Even if you have no one on this planet to turn to, there is someone listening, and that’s God.

As someone who has been suffering for over 10 years, the only advice I can tell you is what I tell myself. “Just one more day.” If you can get through just one more day—even if it means sleeping all day, taking a break from whatever it is that’s tormenting you—then it tells me you’re strong enough to fight this battle. If you feel like you can’t, then I’d suggest going to the closest hospital and ask for help. (I’ve been going for years. It’s scary at first, but it’s not terrible.)

Suicide is a very serious commitment. I know you want the pain to stop—and killing yourself seems like a logical idea—but I promise you, it’s not worth it. Once you die, you won’t be able to feel the relief of the pain gone. Not only that, it leaves the pain for everyone who loves you behind with them.

I know you don’t want to hurt anyone, but I suggest speaking to someone who you can trust. It sounds like you care about your mother enough to stay alive—regardless of the pain—so if you can maybe reach out to her. For a long time I didn’t speak to my mother about suicidal my ideation until after I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. Believe me, you don’t want her to find out that way.

I’m going to leave you with this—God loves you. He doesn’t want anything to happen to you, but part of living in this world means it’s inevitable that you will suffer. That doesn’t mean you have to do it alone.

Feel free to PM me if you want to rant, or cry, or scream—whatever it is you need. I’m not saying that to be courteous, I’m saying that because I mean it. I would hate for you to miss out on true happiness when—for all you know—it can be right around the corner."
