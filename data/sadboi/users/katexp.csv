Plus, you've proven them how you have changed in person since you've been working there."

StudentNurse,epcrg96,t1_epcnmqu,1559157596.0,"yeah I understand that, but to spend so much money on literature classes... just for a hope of getting into this one. I was wondering if it's worth spending so much money for these classes I won't need for anything else. I won't need the literature classes for anything really.. they told me to choose any literature classes I want so I did sign up for whatever was open.. they're basic literature courses and yeah I mean reading edgar allen poe's short stories are interesting, I just am not that financially well-off to spend money like that..

so I was just wondering if I should just start from 0 and apply to other programs instead of waiting and spending money in this college, it's another transcript I would need to order for applications as well in the future. But if my chances are good that I would be accepted to their program, I would so I was just wondering if anyone can provide insights about this situation.."

a really good friend of mine passed away last month from cancer suddenly. She was diagnosed, and few months later, she was gone. she was 32 years old and loving, enjoying life and her new job.

This was first time for me experiencing death of someone close, and I feel that I didn't deal with it well. I know she'd understand though, because she knows how I am, don't handle emotions well and avoid it like the plague.

if you have cash handling experience, which I'm sure you have, definitely include that. check handling, money order selling, accepting also. If you handled large amount of cash, even better. If you supervised, include that as well and idk if you guys audit cash boxes or anything like that but that helps too. If you ever resolved transaction errors, include that too.

teller's probably won't get much more pay if any from what you used to get paid... but being a teller opens you up to other positions in banking, back office, banker etc! good luck!"
