Stutter,fr0qlax,t1_fr0g5mz,1589804181.0,"Folks with social anxiety/fear of public speaking (both are actual disorders) also stutter but it’s different, they only stutter with certain people and/or in particular situations and there’s actually a science to it, too, and it’s slightly similar to stuttering as a speech disorder but instead of permanent reduced blood flow in the Broca’a area, it’s temporary signals being sent to that area that alters the blood flow and hence induce a stutter - I have done my research on this before  and I urge you to look that up. In this case, stuttering is a direct cause of nervousness and that’s it. Using ‘stuttering/stutter’ to describe nervous speech causes confusion and I wish the words ‘stuttering/stutter were never used to describe anything other than stuttering, a neurological speech/disfluency disorder, but unfortunately, it already got out of hand and now everyone thinks ‘nervous speech’ and ‘stuttering’ are the same when they are not.

However, when it comes to people who stutter (stuttering as a speech disorder), the cause is neurological - they don’t stutter because and only when they are nervous but also anytime, any place, and with anyone. I know that a lot of stutterers, me included, stutter more severely when we are, for instance, presenting publicly or perhaps communicating with someone we deem significant. Here, nervousness is not the cause of the ‘stutter’ but a factor that amplifies the ‘stutter’ and I think the way you describe “we try too hard to speak perfectly and in doing so..” falls under this; it’s because we are anxious, we feel pressured, we are uncomfortable, we don’t want to feel different/less than anyone, so we stutter more than we are supposed to or more than we actually do. That’s why some people who stutter go to speech therapy, some techniques are utilized to reduce stuttering or reduce the feelings/reactions we get in some situations in which we feel we should overthink our speech and hence stutter more severely! 

I don’t think it’s fair to say “a lot of the people that think they’re stutterers aren’t,” it will be as if we are gatekeeping because we all stutter differently and whether our stutter mildly or severely or occasionally, we are still folks who stutter (I’m not referring to people who stutter due to social anxiety here. That’s a different case). If anything, I think there should be an alternative for the word ‘stuttering’ to describe ‘nervous speech’ as a result of anxiety/stress/fear of public speaking and not a speech disorder. It’s  causing so much confusion and unfortunately it’s also trivializing/invalidating the experiences of people who stutter. 

If I may also ask, where did you get that info that the main reason people can’t get their words out is because they ‘pre-form’ their tongue? I highly doubt that and if I were going to make a long story short, that’s not applicable to stuttering, at least not as a main cause - as I said nervousness amplifies stuttering and let’s not forget that stuttering could also come with secondary behaviors (eyes closing, moving hands/legs, certain mouth/tongue movements). People don’t stutter because they don’t have ‘fluid’ tongues; this isn’t the main cause. 

To answer your questions, yes I’m a person who stutters and I stutter quite often and unpredictably - I don’t only stutter when I’m giving a presentation but it’s more likely that I’ll stutter/stutter more when I’m presenting. I have a set of words that I find difficult to pronounce. I stutter when I’m talking to my partner, friends, family members, and people I’m most comfortable with. I have fluent moments/day and I also have days where I stutter more often than I usually do with for no apparent reason. Sometimes I stutter when I talk to myself alone in my room and other times I don’t. I don’t understand my stutter and I’m not even trying to understand it but definitely trying my best everyday to accept it and not think less of myself because of it. 

I do believe we all stutter differently, approach it differently, experience it differently, feel it differently, and react to it differently!

Thanks for reading all this."
Stutter,fqzks4x,t3_gls86t,1589769466.0,"It’s not a matter of ‘way of thinking’.. it’s an actual speech disorder that recent studies found that stuttering is linked to reduced blood flow in the area of the brain that produces speech! 

Not to invalidate your experience. If it worked and that’s what you were hoping for, I’m happy for you, but it’s also a bit weird, are you certain you had a speech disorder or was it social anxiety or fear of public speaking (not saying that’s easily solved with changing one’s way of thinking either) but I was wondering.. are you implying that other disorders/disabilities/illnesses are curable by changing one’s way of thinking or is just stuttering and what makes stuttering any less real than other disorders and do we really want to add to the stigma that stuttering isn’t actually a thing because “so what everyone stutters -when they’re nervous-“ so it’s curable with self-discipline? Yeah idk :/

I’m very skeptical about all this but hey, good for you."

Stutter,fpcr0ie,t1_fpc22n1,1588510231.0,"That’s awful. I’m sorry you had to go through all this. They should have known better! 

Have you ever tried confronting them? You need to let this out and they need to know they have done you wrong, it might help you, maybe just slightly. If there’s a way they could do you better, don’t be hesitant to let them know.

This is a real and actual disorder. There isn’t a main cause that can explain why people stutter, perhaps if differs from a person to another - but recent studies have found, and this is posted everything, that’s there’s a dysfunction in the area in the brain responsible for producing speech. If you are interested, look it up.

YOU ARE NOT LAZY. PERIOD. You are anxious. You are worried about people’s reaction. You are not sure others are patient. You can’t guarantee they’ll understand. You can’t tell whether or not you’ll be ridiculed. You don’t know if you could manage uttering what you’d like to say with less ‘interruption.’ This is huge and this is real and valid. That’s what they should be tackling. If they can’t believe any of this then please validate yourself. You know it’s a disorder and hence it’s not your fault. You know the reason you don’t raise your hand isn’t because you are lazy.

By the way, I stutter too and severely, and I also have social anxiety, and I can’t lie, it’s hard and it’s frustrating but it really gets better. I’m in my fourth year of university. I’m pursuing a double degree. I’m graduating soon. I’m trying my best. I have friends. I have people I know. I had partners. I did things and I do things. Bad things happen along the way, I had days where I could barely say a word and others days where I can say three words without stuttering can you imagine!!

But hey I’m here and I’m living."
Stutter,fpbiime,t3_gcg07v,1588470798.0,Dannggg yup 😂😭
Stutter,fpbihpt,t3_gcg489,1588470781.0,It isn’t.
Stutter,fpbago4,t3_gc2gme,1588465606.0,"Absolutely, it’s a huge part of me. I’m not saying I embrace it fully and that it does not frustrate me, but only reason it frustrates me is because a lot of people people are unaware and unaccepting, and some are mean enough to look down upon me or/and make fun of me, finish my sentences, and think less of me. 

Sometimes I wonder if scientists/medical professionals found a cure, would I take it? At days when I’m too tired of having to face up a world where you are expected to speak in a certain way and in a particular pace and where difference is not another way of life/living but a deficit, I’d say yes, I want to the cure. However most of the time, it’s a no, I don’t want to overcome my stutter (I mean not that I can. I tried!).

I’m not only my stutter and I’m not only a stutterer, but stuttering can also be me; it’s a disability (disability as a social construct, meaning it’s something that’s disabling me because I’m in a society that has a rigid understandings of what’s normal and abnormal, hence, my sentences are completed, people are impatient, I may be rejected by some, I may lose a job because of it, I may not be allowed to take part in discussions, I may not be hired, I may not be allowed to have a particular career, I may lose grades as a student, I may not be promoted..etc) and disability is an identity marker. By the way, I understand not all stutterers feel comfortable identifying as disabled, it’s really just a personal choice, but I’d like them to understand that there’s no such thing as ‘real/severe disabilities’ and mild disabilities. Disability is not a hierarchy, it’s a spectrum, and it’s also not a slur. 

This toxic and ableist (discrimination against people with disabilities) environment needs to change. We don’t all have to be the same because we were never born the same and were never meant to be the same. 

I wouldn’t know who I would be if I didn’t stutter. It informs my every experience and memory, and therefore, how I see and relate to the world."
Stutter,fpb8cpw,t3_gcd89s,1588464281.0,"I feel you. I never liked speech therapists and never went to one, but I was approached by a few and met a few, they all gave me tips on how to ‘overcome’ my stutter and I didn’t even ask for help! (I’m not saying if someone’s a speech therapist then they are inherently bad not necessarily, but that’s my experience) 

I have always held a grudge against them! I can’t let into my life anyone who thinks there’s something about me that’s terribly wrong and ‘abnormal’ that I need to change! 

Please, don’t lose hope, and I wish you come to a point in your life where you stop fighting yourself. I know it’s frustrating, stuttering frustrates me, too, but I know I have to accept it as part of me, and whoever has a problem with that that is unwelcome. 

I highly recommend you take the time to read this https://www.didistutter.org/blog/category/speech-language-pathology

This blog is awesome! They celebrate stuttering (I know it sounds weird and many people would probably think well who can even embrace their stutter? Well many and I’m included). I mean I think we need this. I’m so done being ridiculed, being looked down upon, being told I should change to be able ‘to speak normally.’

I realized we are discriminated against, looked down upon, and made fun of even by mental health professionals, individuals who are supposed to help us.

Generally speaking, personality disorders are more often than not consigned to oblivion when discussing or raising awareness about mental health/psychological issues; however, narrowing it down, when it comes to BPD, I believe it is the most undermined because it is nothing the public can romanticize for their own ‘we are understanding/accepting’ image. 

Sometimes it’s easier for me to say I have anxiety or depression.

That sucks!"

BPD,fl3m8e0,t1_fl3ctvy,1584790456.0,"I never told anyone they’re my FP but I did tell two of my friends that I have BPD only because I knew they would be understanding but only one of them truly understands - like for instance sometimes when I start reacting or doubting her loyalty, I do tell her. This friend also happens to be one of my FPs (I’d say that I have two) but I didn’t tell her that she is. I mean if she reads enough and does her research on BPD, she would have known that she’s my FB. The irony.

I wouldn’t advise that you tell them unless you are certain they are very understanding and compassionate. Most wouldn’t take it lightly."
BPD,fl271v1,t1_fl0g3hh,1584744380.0,"Yeah, of course, but taking some time to reflect, perhaps if I had to and if they are understanding enough, I might even take it to them so I can dismantle my narrative. This helps. It’s okay to feel devastated but don’t let it consume you. Ask yourself questions, like whether or not you are completely demonizing them or whether or not you are taking it too personally and maybe it has nothing to do with you. 

One advise though, don’t project your feelings into them. It’ll ruin your friendship/relationship.

There are people I have been with for years who I still believe don’t genuinely like me and yet we talk sometimes and chill around. It’s hard but i’ll work with what I have."
BPD,fkzbyr0,t3_flezem,1584667456.0,"That’s not okay. Please make sure he doesn’t do that because he enjoys playing with your feelings especially considering that he knows he has some kind of power over you due to how much he influences you as your FP. 

Let him know that you are upset about this and if ever does it again, either confront him to fix things or try to register that you deserve better.

When things are okay, I find myself questioning my perspective, like maybe there’s something I haven’t interpreted well, maybe I missed a sign, because for instance let’s say “there’s no way this person genuinely cares about me and likes me for who I’m, so perhaps they are pretending, or they want something from me, or maybe they don’t mean any of it.” It’s just not what I deserve, I think."
BPD,fkz8nb4,t3_flext1,1584665271.0,"Yes definitely. I got diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago. Still fighting. I can tell you that it gets better. With more self-awareness and maybe both or either with the right medications and a good therapist, you’ll manage your way through it - you may not change, you get to still be you but with survival tips. For example, I used to be exactly like you. Now at least while I am dependent on them and would love more than anything to have their full attention, I manage to rationalize all this to detach a bit.
