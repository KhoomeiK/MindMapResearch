I was hesistant at first because I'd had the ssri mania before my bipolar diagnosis, but I was miserably depressed so I gave it a go. So far so good, only thing thats making me nervous is that my abilify was giving me really bad tremors so Im weaning down on it, and I don't know if that will cause a mood change. But my NP has been trying her best with me for the past year, so I'm hanging in there and being compliant. Good luck with your meds."

ptsd,exu0izb,t3_cuf8g2,1566577659.0,"Thats not an uncommon thing to see in the bdsm community, pain as catharsis. I myself as a victim of sexual assaults had power play fantasies. The allure is that bdsm is safe, sane, and consentual so you can explore your limitations. Controlled pain can allow us to process pain we've had before. Ive actually heard a talk from Raven Caldera about processing trauma through careful BDSM. He warns though that bdsm is *not* actually therapy, and that having a trusted therapist to help you process is the best thing you can do for yourself.

I guess what I'm saying is you're not alone."
