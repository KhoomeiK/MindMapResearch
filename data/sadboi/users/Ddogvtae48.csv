Also it's not so uncommon to think you're the protagonist. And I can't say God isn't being a dick about all of this, buts it's unlikely we control our lives the best we can, and sometimes shit happens. It's cruel and unfair but it's apart of being human.

BPD,fpcr22a,t3_gcof7q,1588510267.0,"So I fuged a relationship with someone I found to be very special, kind patient loving and could communicate really really well, but all of that got in my head, and I pushed her away because I really felt like she was to good to be with me. That I would ruin all the best parts of her. Or feared that she wise up and leave me. 

And being someone's fp is more then just intimacy it's everything for some people. She could have seen you as her other half or more. It's possible all the things she was getting from you, she couldn't or wasn't getting from him. And when you pulled back she freaked out and went down the rabbit hole a lot of baseless fears take hold and we act out in different ways she just kept doing what she did to prove to herself all the stuff she thought was true. ""She can't really love me, if I act like me she'll leave me like they did."" And quickly sprials from there. To all sorts of terrible ideas."
BPD,fpcmqkg,t3_gco86i,1588506284.0,"It's a part of the process, jokes are fine in doses i think, but bottling these emotions is not a good idea. Be clear and tell the truth. Those jokes make you feel insecure sometimes that's a pretty human reaction. Don't let bpd own you sis!"
BPD,fpcmcye,t3_gcof7q,1588505901.0,"Made it clear isn't exactly correct. I get like this sometimes so from my perspective it's a security blanket type of situation. Someone to comfort and be intimate with while not going that next step. That sounds worse then it is, but she likely enough believes that you're to good for her, and she's in a relationship. it's very likely she considere you her favorite person which makes her feelings for you very intense. That guilt, shame, passion just becomes a lot and we can lash out or distance ourselves or just cut the cord. And after the diagnosis she may want to reach out to apologies or start over. From my experience I've distanced myself from several people and i think about a lot of them everyday. And after my diagnosis  i reached out to a few people to apologize or just explain myself better. Having bpd and knowing you have bpd can make a world of difference for some people. 

That being said it's not your responsibility to talk to her if you don't want to your feelings are valid and you are more then allowed to not subject yourself to those triggers, but if you do here are some  tips boundaries not just for her but for yourself ie cuddling, spending the night, texting each other constantly, open clear communication really explain your thoughts in a situation and if you don't understand something ask for an better explanation, and the most important thing an almost unreasonable amount of patience. I really hope this helps you make a more clear decision about your next step."

BPD,fhgo0ua,t3_f33tmt,1581572763.0,You've already started the process and that's recognizing the split and its root. Now you just need to be verbal with the person. Try asking her if there's something you can do to ease her stress. She's not bad she's human it happens.
BPD,fhgntgo,t3_f33zho,1581572573.0,"Okay so I read it all and I can understand why you felt patronized, so I'll try to word this as best I can. We have a really hard time with black and white thinking, and unfortunately we also have to communicate differently telling him you dont want advice just wanna vent could have helped. We also detach really quickly having a split moment is a part of bpd it happens. If I can offer any advice it's to unblock him and just say you need a some space. Then reassess the conversation later, and hopefully explain it less aggressively. But overall this isnt the end of anything we just have to be patient with ourselves and other people and remember there's two sides."

Sounds like you're trying to change him, and because his change is either slow or stagnant it might feel like he's not trying at all. But you really dont know what he's thinking or feeling. That being said if the relationship really has become abusive you should probably leave it. Doesn't matter who's abusive because it's a very dangerous circle to fall into."

BPD,fhdnf6w,t3_f2mim3,1581492643.0,Boundaries are important and you have to be honest with her before you resent her because you'll possibly do or say something you can not take back or joke away. You have to be honest tell her the truth.
BPD,fhdn7fn,t1_fhdmxqg,1581492390.0,"Only three people know about me and that's a lot for me so don't worry about telling anyone. I suggest talking more to people who also have it, and once you realize the very broad spectrum of what having bpd can look like it'll be less exposing hopefully."

BPD,fhch12r,t1_fhcealu,1581462865.0,You're more then allowed to ask to take an evaluation and to find a doc that will work with you. If one is being dismissive ask for a recommendation.
BPD,fhcdtrn,t3_f2etzi,1581461260.0,"Yes, one of my exs became very abusive at the end, I wont say I didn't cause any problems but they're verbal and physical abuse was inexcusable. Have you told your therapist about the abuse? Because in my own experience it can go from ""shut up"" to ""he hit me"" real quick. You need to talk to your therapist and trusted allies before it ever gets to that point."
BPD,fhccs7e,t3_f2eu7c,1581460770.0,"We all slack off from time to time doesn't mean it's the end of the world, if you were gonna be late for work or not go we would call the boss and hopefully explain what happened. Call your doc and just tell the truth it'll be okay."

If you've got your therapist working with you I suggest doing both on the same day preferably FP first then therapist. Living in a sort of limbo can be more harmful then we think it's important to know what you both expect, and what you are boundaries are our best and worst friend in these situations. I hope this helps friend."

I have recently learned that I am borderline and if there was ever anything I could do fix any of my relationships in the past it would be to talk. Openly fully say exactly what you're feeling. It's a lot to ask of anyone but I think those of us with boderline have to try that much harder especially in a relationship. You really dont get to many of those in life that last more then a few weeks. 6 months is rare. Sit down and tell her what you just told us it will be hard it may even hurt but it is the right thing to do."

My issue comes from all the lieing about why now. Be honest with your customers more often even if they think it's wrong they can respect the honesty and work towards a middle. My biggest problems come from those who say the Go, and masters do well with even less work so why bother? Idk because you hold pride in your work? Because you are the most commercial aspect of an entire franchise? Because it's a mobile game and you can do more then that? Idk pick one, I'm gonna play the hell out of sword and after Christmas play the other. And when home drops I'm gonna play that shit again with a pre made team. Gamefreak you have me by a very real and emotional attachment to my balls. To be even more honest I would have liked it of they kept up the gimmick from black and white.
