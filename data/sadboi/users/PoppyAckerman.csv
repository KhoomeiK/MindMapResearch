Sweden has 10 million people and they aren't testing either. We have over 300 million people and, as you probably know, we aren't testing. At least not to the extent it's needed. A conservative estimate of morbidity is somewhere around 1% and 2% (and that is not taking into account future health problems from Sars-Cov-2 and it's likely this will be an enormous toll on the healthcare system). That's millions of people.

The first wave was the virus coming into the US. The second will be that everybody that has it will spread it across the country. The only thing keeping that under control right now is sheltering in and lockdowns.

Scientists have made some pretty significant headway already. We need the testing, trace backs and PPE for all to keep that under control. Opening the economies fully, before we have these things, will absolutely be catastrophic."
