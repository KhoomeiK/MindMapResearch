BPD,f9cfodo,t1_f9ceiyt,1575223189.0,"I’m glad you can recognise it is not your fault. I would definitely from now on keep a list of red flags you don’t want to gloss over in the future. Think about the toxic traits your ex presented and how you could recognise them in the future before it’s “too late” (for lack of better words, because it’s never too late). Promise yourself that you will be much more aware of other people’s behaviours and how they make you feel. People are expendable - but we often feel like losing one person is a *huge* loss. In reality, we adapt, we change and we do move forward, even after being 100% sure we would never recover. 

In regards to the Fear Of Abandonment, can you try to put the fear right in front of your face? (Providing it isn’t dangerous to you) 
Another technique I used was deciding a time frame. So, I’d meet my friends at 4pm and leave by 8pm - no later. It was really, really hard but I found that agreeing on a specific time frame before meeting with my friends was one of the best ways to help me face it. I explained to them why I was doing it and they supported me with it, quite often helping me with getting ready to leave and ensuring that they validated me, my feelings and our relationship - telling me it was OK. It also helps if you have a friend you can call after you’ve left, if you’re still feeling particularly uncomfortable about leaving. It keeps a line of connection, but it’s just a little more distanced which may help? 

Take it easy, battling these symptoms are exhausting. Just try to make one small positive change every day. <3"
BPD,f9ca89y,t1_f9c6nz1,1575221131.0,"I found “acceptance” really difficult. It always felt like I was saying “I deserved it, I caused it” etc. But that’s *not* the case. 

With acceptance, you can say “They did this to me, I feel like this about it, I can’t change it but I can move forward from it.” This way - you’re not placing any blame on yourself and acknowledging that the other persons actions affected you but that you can move forward. 

Acceptance doesn’t mean you will or have to forget about what someone has done to you; but it also doesn’t mean that any pain associated with it will simply fade away. 

Forgiveness is almost always about the other person. Acceptance is always about you. Learning to come to terms with what happened and accepting that it was *not your fault*. 

Your ex was toxic, and what they did to you is entirely on them. For example: If they abused you, it’s *their* fault - not yours. They chose to abuse you. And I say chose because abuse is *always* a choice. It’s almost always premeditated. Truthfully, their actions have *nothing to do with you* (even if it was directed at you) and *everything to do with themselves.* 

In my experience with a toxic ex, I was lucky enough to get onto the Freedom Programme which taught me so much about abuse cycles - maybe have a read about toxic partners. It could help. 

I’m not very good at wording things, so I hope this helps explain. If not - don’t be afraid to message me or comment again :)"
BPD,f952ou9,t1_f94bm1w,1575116986.0,"Hi there. I believe you are capable of getting better. I thought the same as you - I thought I'd be too traumatised to ever come back from. The damage is still there, after nearly a decade of severe domestic violence - and yet, here I am. Moving forward from that damage. Healing mentally. Physically, there are injuries that will never heal. I lost more than I could ever detail on a public post like this, but if you take anything from this, just know - *you're never too damaged to come back from.* 

Trauma is literally *designed* to make us feel like we can never heal, but truthfully - we can. I hope you find your way through this. Sending love."
BPD,f952ebe,t1_f93u9fh,1575116693.0,"Hi there! I'm so sorry to hear about your relapse, but I promise you - they are totally normal and actually, I'd be worried if people in recovery didn't have relapses. As another commenter pointed out, you are currently treading down new pathways in your brain. Your brain would rather be lazy and take the short way around - the one it already knows. Say 'fuck you, brain, we're going MY way!' But also, remember to be gentle and kind to yourself, especially in times of relapse. I see my relapses as myself from my childhood - the little girl who didn't know any better, the little girl who just needs a hug and to be told 'it's going to be ok' - I became that person for her. Become that person for you. You got this, you're a bad ass even if you don't feel like it! <3"
BPD,f9528dx,t1_f94w2s0,1575116501.0,"I have a mild form of ADHD, but it's not something I've particularly struggled with, so I am sorry for your difficult experience. 

I do find using the STOP skill helps me immensely. 

If I feel an intense emotion or feeling bubbling, I slap my leg and either out loud (ok, most of the time I say it out loud) or in my head say ""**STOP!**"" 

**S**top - Physically stop all movement.   
**T**ake a step back - I also physically take a step back. Breathe.   
**O**bserve - Observe the situation/event/thought/feeling. What does it feel like? What does it look like? What do you *feel* like is happening? What is *actually* happening? The point here is to challenge your thinking, ""am I catastrophising?""    
**P**roceed mindfully - Move a little slower. How can you best face the situation? 

BPD is hard enough on it's own - you're a fuckin warrior even if you don't feel like it!"
BPD,f951wa7,t1_f93u0j0,1575116005.0,"I'm so sorry for how difficult you're finding this right now. If it makes you feel any better, I too once thought I would never escape. Dissociation is a pain in the ass. Have you tried researching some coping mechanisms for it? I find that engaging with my senses really help - what can I see, touch, smell etc. What works for me may not work for you - but I hope you find your way out of this. Sending hugs."
BPD,f951sms,t1_f9358gz,1575115850.0,"Hi there. Well done for the hard work you're putting in! It's exhausting, isn't it? 

The thing is, acknowledging our own toxic traits is bound to make us feel guilty, and of course, it will make us want to withdraw away from people - but you've taken the first step. You've identified the toxic traits. Now, what are you going to do about them? Can you change them or improve them? If you can't, how can you begin to accept them as simply a a part of you? Withdrawing away from people wont help - it'll just amplify any negative feelings you already have. Are there people close to you that you can talk to, and ask them to help you evaluate yourself and create a 'better you' plan? 

Identifying whether the way you're being treated by others is super difficult. I had spent 8 years in domestic violence and had no idea what was 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' - what I did know, however, was how I felt after being around people - that was a big indicator for me of how I truly felt (not my BPD). If I was exhausted, feeling drained, anxious, sad or angry  continuously after spending time with somebody; I would work on exiting the relationship. What worked for me was a *lot* of research on healthy relationships and time...   
One thing I will say is that **every** feeling you have is valid. All of 'em. Sadness, anger, shame, despair, happiness... 

In regards to retaining my sense of self worth while being objective of myself, well, this was super difficult. I lied to myself, a lot. The whole 'fake it 'til you make it' thing worked for me, here. I've always hated my reflection in the mirror, I hated my personality and the way I was/am - but there came a point that I said to myself ""I don't deserve to feel like this anymore. I am worthy of life, I am worthy of love and I am worthy of loving myself and my life."" 

I challenged myself to look in the mirror and pick 3 things I like about myself every day. (yup, even if they were lies) I'd put a smile on my face and say ""I love my teeth, they're so pretty and my smile is amazing!"" I'd repeat it a few times, until I felt it coming from my stomach. Loud and clear. 

""I love myself. I am funny, smart and talented."" Or any variation worked for me. And a lot of mindfulness. I also found that if I read/watched inspiring things, the Chameleon effect would kick in and I would feel more inspired to create a better change for myself. 

I'm sorry if this makes little to no sense. It's really hard to explain - BPD is one giant tangled web!"
BPD,f951amw,t1_f931swt,1575115075.0,"I'm so glad this post has helped you, even if only a little. I'm sorry about your friends becoming distant - I understand that's extremely painful, but I know you can move forward. The good thing is, we all can even if it feels impossible. Big hugs to you <3"
