aspergers,fkj9jag,t3_figowq,1584239757.0,"I can fit in when I *have* to -- ""for a limited time only, terms and conditions usually apply."" I've learned how to slip into a carefully rehearsed set of predefined roles and scripts when necessary, so I can fake it (mask) in situations that demand it. But it's exhausting, painful, and debilitating if I do it for too long. I've also learned (like now in seclusion with everything shut down for virus time), that when I have lots of unstructured time on my own, I go full autistic and all masks come off. I stop talking, stim more, I don't leave home, have no idea what's going on outside and don't care.  It's the environment, and if I'm with people, and who they are. I'm quite inclined to stay to myself and ignore everyone -- they usually ignore me anyway (or criticize), so I'm fine with that. Unless someone happens to share an interest, which is rare."

I had requested another therapist but she refused to see me. I hate therapists.  Went thru years of therapy.  Didn't do a damned thing.

depression,f9uw0bj,t1_f9szur0,1575658700.0,"I actually was diagnosed with MDD, I've been battling it for many years.  It's exhausting to live with, it doesn't respond to meds, and it's a beast of a disorder to fight. People saying positive things like think happy thoughts or it will get better only piss it off. I have survived so many plans, dates, and ""how-to's"" .... I'm glad Reddit has this thread. We can be real here and see we're not alone, and that can be enough to fend the beast off for a little while. Sometimes the worst thing is feeling that you're alone, that no one understands you or cares, or can hear you. Tackle that massive isolation problem (Reddit forum) and that can help save lives.  Just my opinion."
depression,f9uufr7,t1_f9tah0u,1575657903.0,I don't think anyone is normal-- I think many people are hiding their real feelings just to survive and be liked by others. The social consequences of being our real selves can be very painful when we don't.  Think that's one reason why so many of us are in this thread.
depression,f9uu2o7,t1_f9tsgw3,1575657714.0,"I did this (reached out to a few) and found out that we are all suffering. Problem is none of us are strong enough to support each other for now, and we all need help, but no one can afford or access treatments.  The only treatments are drugs with side effects. So most of us have chosen to go it alone and tempt fate. I found forums, and I write privately -- a lot. And I listen to music. I stopped talking (talking attracts angry people). My friends care, and we check in .... but we are all deeply depressed. Seems to be a global thing going on. Idk?"

Wanting people dead that you never met????  How miserable must you be ...... I can't think of anyone that I actually hate. Dislike, yes.  But I don't hate anyone."
