offmychest,fka1r3h,t3_fgx1ww,1583989528.0,"not only do i not want kids, i cannot have them. tired of people saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôll change your mind when you‚Äôre older and married‚Äù. umm i am gay and even if i were to want kids in the future, i would adopt! the earth is overpopulated anyways. in the future i plan on getting my tubes tied. fuck the expectation that all women should want to be mothers."
mentalhealth,fk5c2l7,t3_fgexig,1583877497.0,i have a little limp because i have a pretty major leg discrepancy. drives me crazy. i always look at my feet and make sure they don‚Äôt look weird. also obsessed with posture.
women,fjmpfpg,t1_fjmohg2,1583478292.0,oh. i don‚Äôt wear skirts but i thrift most of my pants. i have this great pair with huge cargo pockets that were like $8. anyways my apologies i guess i just don‚Äôt understand the struggle. i‚Äôm petite with weird proportions so i alter my clothes myself which saves a ton too. i live in a big city so that probably helps with the clothing selection. best of luck finding that skirt lol
