Overwatch,f0gp1i9,t3_d40yb8,1568603524.0,"Obviously I‚Äôm a Zarya main, but I still have to vouch ‚Äî Zarya could be meta soon. If Sigma does get nerfed, then Zarya will melt him much faster than she already does. On another note, I have really been enjoying Sigma! As the pros said recently, maximizing his potential will win your team(s) a lot of games. I‚Äôm seeing the areas in which he could be nerfed, but I still think he will be in the meta as long as his shield‚Äòs base health stays above 1000."
chess,esotl94,t1_esolpjl,1562173994.0,Yeah this is what I saw after realizing the pawn had no choice but to capture the rook. My chess game is best played when I just force moves and leave the opponent wondering why I‚Äôm stealing their queen early-game. üòÇ Beautiful move here to say the least
LSD,erstv2u,t1_errsyio,1561224063.0,"The only shark that‚Äôs aggressive by nature is the bull shark. The rest very rarely attack; you just need to have an extreme regard for their turf. That said, I think I would need to go diving several times sober before I dosed and did it."
Rainbow6,erjh18e,t1_erjgus8,1560929161.0,"It‚Äôs also a result of not queueing ranked with a full team. It‚Äôs unfortunate due to the toxicity, but these issues can easily be avoided by 
only playing ranked with four other people you  like playing with."
Rainbow6,erjgu4z,t3_bnl0f0,1560928879.0,"If you can control the vertical recoil, the gun is extremely easy to use. If you trust that spray and really work on keeping your shots centered, you‚Äôll be satisfied with how quickly you‚Äôll mow people down. I **highly** recommend using the holographic sight on it too. That rate of fire **and** clip size is absolutely insane and should be taken advantage of by more players."
depression,epigys6,t1_epgiiuc,1559239081.0,"It was so prevalent in Greek life too. When I got blackballed, I just noticed so many brothers absolutely hated their lives and the people they have to deal with every day. Some of those same people were the ones who were constantly livid with my apathetic attitude. To be fair, these elements made me a bad brother; I *never* should have been there in the first place despite the fact that I had a lot of good times and was responsible for a lot of progress."
depression,epfrjh3,t1_epe3v1e,1559200531.0,"I agree. I‚Äôm 21 and never enjoyed running the rat race. I was in Greek life for a period of time while I was at university, and 90% of the time I would choose to stay in my apartment and play video games and hang out with my roommates. A lot of the brothers thought I had issues for joining a fraternity and not participating in many events (*they weren‚Äôt kind about sharing their opinions either*). I learned that the people who try to make you feel bad about not running with the pack are *usually* the people who wish they had the discipline to march to their own drummer."

It has been far from easy to deal with, especially since I was only 15 when it happened. However, I take peace in the fact that she‚Äôs not suffering anymore. The community along with myself are always willing to share our stories with those who suffer."
depression,ep9cp8w,t1_ep9but5,1559107850.0,"Thank you so much. I still struggle with getting out of bed. It still feels insanely difficult, and on days where I don‚Äôt have anything going on‚Äîwhich has been often recently‚Äîit‚Äôs even more difficult."
Rainbow6,eohc2sl,t1_eohbk65,1558577817.0,I forgot to consider how important Glaz is to certain strategies on a lot of maps. It‚Äôs going to be sick to watch Warden and Glaz go at it in 1 v 1 situations.
Rainbow6,eoeu7jb,t1_eoe4c50,1558508431.0,"Exactly. This operation was more of Operation Health continued. The game is already in a great state (for the most part), and it should hopefully improve more. To be honest, N√∏kk and Warden are really not great operators and probably won‚Äôt be a big deal in the competitive/professional atmosphere. I could see Warden being slightly useful, but pros are more than likely just going to stop using Glaz all together, and I think that was Ubisoft‚Äôs goal when they released Warden."
