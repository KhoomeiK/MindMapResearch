It’s basically clerical/phones but it’s for a really good company. It would be Monday-Friday which I need, and no weekends or holidays. Well, important holidays, I’m sure it’s open on Presidents’ Day or whatever. 

I’m nervous. I don’t know why because it’s not like I don’t have a job to go back to; I totally do. But I’m nervous just the same."
