Marijuana,fnyipc7,t3_g4fwnd,1587364315.0,"I suggest one with high CBD instead. This is the part of weed that helps calm anxious people like myself down. THC can make your brain overreact to a current stress one may be having unfortunately.

Simply put, CBD is the sedating, calming part you would need in a anxiety-inducing sitch. THC is the “high” inducing chemical part of weed, it can relate whatever feeling you may have whether it’s happy, depressing, or anxious feeling.

I wish more CBD strains though were available where I’m from."

bipolar,fnr836h,t3_g3cpuk,1587181628.0,I would like to try getting back to painting again soon after seeing this. ☺️😌 This is lovely!
bipolar,fnmza00,t1_fnmyv99,1587081115.0,Thank you! I hope it helps me monitor myself. It’s hard to keep track of myself. It’s hard to pinpoint triggers. I hope this help me indeed.
bipolar,fnmvpem,t3_g2idhh,1587079073.0,What app is this? I think I need it.
depression,fnmuw02,t3_fbd1e6,1587078618.0,"I can relate very much to your post. Being an Asian kid with the expectation of Asian parents is hard. The thoughts have stayed with me and have worsened as an adult. I feel for you. I traced my bouts of depression at the age of 14 when I failed to make it to the honor roll for the first time in my life, because I failed to meet 1 last requirement due to me being sick. *sighs* I know it sounds petty, but it’s then that I realized that I was building my future on the expectations of my parents and people who used to commend me. I was building an image they wanted to see in me. When I failed to be what they wanted, I felt like my future was crumbling down. 

I’m currently trying to find myself. But to no avail so far... Should I give up on myself already though? Many would say no. But honestly, I just really do not like myself. I’m tired of making wrong decisions. I’m tired of loving people so much but not being able to meet their standards. *sighs*

I’m just really trying my best to find the good in things of this life. I don’t wanna hurt people when I go. But can it be avoided? If it can’t, I hope they don’t have the same cycle of pain that we do. I hope Asian parents or any parent in particular wouldn’t put this kind of burden on their children. It makes us have an even more difficult time surviving this harsh world. :(

*sighs* but thank you, my pain was somehow alleviated knowing that there are people like me who are hurting too. I just wish this wasn’t the case. I don’t like seeing people hurting. That’s why I wanted to be a doctor as a kid. But yeah, at 2nd year of Medical School Proper, I was deemed “unfit” for Medschool by my Psychiatrist who was also one of my teachers there. I just couldn’t handle the emotional responsibility and strength that it takes to be a doctor. 3 of my schoolmates during that last school year that I was in Medschool already committed suicide. That was back at early 2018. 

I opted out of MedSchool coz I didn’t wanna end up like them. They were happy people. At least outwardly. Actually normally, I’m a super happy person. People will be surprised if I’m gone... :( They will be very hurt. I don’t want that. I cared for people too much whether they’re nice to me or not.

It’s because I know that everyone out there is going through this invisible war zone in their head. I try to put myself in other people’s shoes. I do my best to see the good in people."
Anxiety,fnmsnl0,t3_frlkiv,1587077397.0,"Nope. I usually don’t for some moment. Sometimes I’m not even aware that I’m anxious until I get an anxiety attack or a panic attack.

Anxiety is usually racing thoughts in your head that is unclear and gets you fussed up.

I have Bipolar disorder type 2. I get these a lot. 

To calm myself down somehow, I try to go through the messiness of my thoughts and pinpoint what triggered me if possible.

You have to identify your trigger points for you to be able to find ways to deal with it better in the future."
depression,fnmru6i,t3_g2ilke,1587076950.0,"I’m the one whose post you commented on 4 hours ago. And I just wanna say, prioritize your health over work. If not for yourself, do it for the people you care for. Even if you need that work and do not want to lose it. PrioritiZe your mental and physical health. It’s gonna be hard, but at least you’re making an effort to try to calm down and be okay again. 

I do not have the exact answer or cure on how to have that feeling go away, but I can empathize with you coz we can relate to each other. I’ve been crying all night too. If you’re from HKG, we have the same time zone coz I’m from the PH. 

Even if I’m not with you physically now, I’m hugging you right now in my thoughts. And I just took the time to pray for you and me now. I don’t know if we can do this, but God knows. I hope we make it in life. :)"

Remember this, ignorant people tend to be louder. Their heads are like drums being beaten. Hollow. Empty. Hehe They better read up, get bent, and fill it up with the right info or else MLBB will reek of ignorant airheads. Hehe

I also feel for you that it’s hard to report them successfully for their negativity. If only. I wish they would get an immediate punishment for their negativity."
MobileLegendsGame,fmx3xvv,t1_fmx32i2,1586458030.0,Noted. Will do so next time. This is the second time I experienced this. Still hoping they would be willing to at least check it though. I do have the battle ID after all.
MobileLegendsGame,fmx3odg,t1_fmx1fr3,1586457898.0,The tank went to help me because I messaged the team that I began to lag all of a sudden and I cannot guard the top lane well. I needed his help to ward them off somehow. But then he also got affected like me upon clashing with the two. Both FPS drop and lagging.
MobileLegendsGame,fmx3253,t1_fmx2u03,1586457583.0,Woah 😳 really? I hope the moderators respond to me soon about this.
MobileLegendsGame,fmwxg7z,t1_fmwfvfk,1586454743.0,"Nope, I understand what FPS (frames per second) means. Other than FPS suddenly dropping. We began to lag in the entire game after that."

MobileLegendsGame,fmwf0sb,t3_fxtnf1,1586445403.0,"Save with caution. Don’t “sacrifice” your life to feed the enemy and make them stronger. If you know you can’t handle the enemies who are killing your teammate, save yourself and make yourself stronger through suitable builds and farming with caution while making sure the lane closest to you is cleared. That way you can be strong enough to defend your team in the latter parts.

Be careful not to use “saving” them as an excuse to get killed. You are not their armour. You are there to defend them with caution. This is a strategic game after all."
MobileLegendsGame,fmwe83o,t3_fxtvq8,1586444981.0,Hooray!!!!!!! ❤️ Thanks for taking action on that MLBB moderators. And thank you to those who reported these wretched goons. Kudos to you guys!
MobileLegendsGame,fmwdray,t1_fmwck2m,1586444731.0,"Thanks for the acknowledgment. I get where you’re coming from. Well, I’m just taking a chance just in case it’s true so that such people could be dealt with ASAP before MLBB becomes a den of cheaters and hackers more than fair players. I’ve kept the battle ID just in case the moderator would be willing to check the game internally themselves."
MobileLegendsGame,fmwbp22,t1_fmwbgn5,1586443595.0,I see. Noted. But what explains both Johnson and I lagging upon encountering them and throughout the game? Two different players at different places who’s connection speed was fine until encounter with them? Not taunting you in any way. Willing to be enlightened that’s all.

MobileLegendsGame,fmwacbf,t1_fmw9uid,1586442828.0,You can even see that I move unnaturally here and went straight to the enemies without being able to control my character properly after the FPS suddenly dropped and both Johnson and I started to lag.
MobileLegendsGame,fmwa4t4,t1_fmwa09b,1586442709.0,I’m sure of it. I had my relative from home try playing a high resolution vid and it played fine.
MobileLegendsGame,fmw9uid,t3_fxtdnb,1586442546.0,Replay doesn’t show our lagging and bad fps but initial encounter with them caused Johnson and I (Angela) to have bad fps and severe lagging all of a sudden and all throughout the game. I hope moderators would do something about this ASAP. 😔
MobileLegendsGame,fmo7fit,t1_fmgqlyt,1586248192.0,What shouldn’t be there exactly? Can you elaborate? Sorry. Still in the lower ranks. Just wanna be informed.
