If you are in need of a textbook, try requesting the book from your public library via interlibrary loan. A librarian will search libraries outside of its network that are willing to lend you the book. If a community college library is your public library, the chance of obtaining your desired textbook is greater since it is an academic institution requesting the material. 

Before the return date approaches, simply request the book again. I have not paid for textbooks in years."
