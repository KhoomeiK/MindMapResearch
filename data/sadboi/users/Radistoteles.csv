It would be great if you get punching bag, so you can release the tension. Or anything else you can punch or destroy. Also any physical activity to which you can put the energy, should help (do 30 push ups for example).

Try to just scream before you get to the destroying point, it probably won't stop you from doing that, but it reduces the energy putted into physical aggression.

Try music. I found out metal is making me calm. It may seem like bullshit (I used to think that way), but it changed my life to better in many aspects.

Music. If you wanna overscream the voices in your head this quiet 3BPM won't help even a bit. You can put (through the music) some other topics in your head, but has to at least as serious/complicated as the mental issues. Or you can empathize through it, sometimes helps that you know you are not alone and you are not wrong/failure/the one to blame etc. Or you can overscream it. Metal is the best for this (combination of everything above or even more). For sleeping is best Melo or Prog death metal/Deathcore.

The ""teleport"" is just a joke I presume.

Those quotes aren't really useful. It's empty words. Put there something more philosophical that make people think, that give them rational hope.

When something happens and you feel you're going to break down or have panic attack try to just think about it for awhile, like go through it again and try to be objective. This may help from overreacting or reacting wrong.

Really useful would be if you figured out, why did those situations make you feel that way. Sometimes it's just because of lot of stress, but sometimes it's because you hate the certain person or something else.

I am sportsman and since I was little kid (5) everybody always told me that hard work is paying of. Later I found out that it applies to everything. But it needs time to show, if you hold on few months you will see improvements. This should help you with confidence. Don't be sad if you don't improve you can't be great at everything. For the beggining try something easy what you are enjoying and master your skills.

Other point, before putting the effort in, ask yourself if you really want to do it and if it costs the time and effort. Either do it 100 % or don't do it at all. 

Example: I hate biology so I just don't give a fuck, only try as hard as I need to pass. 

But. Math is extremely boring for me and I am not good at it, but I need it for physics so I try hard in topics I'll need for physics. Same with I hate running hills, but I need it to be good at hockey so I put everything in. 

First help for me from anxiety attack is metal (can be any music I guess). If it's possible I put on headphones and listen till I calm down. If it's not possible I just sing some song in my head. It's not lifesaving, but better than nothing.

Sharing this with parents or friends depends on how is your relationship. (I will never tell my family and my friends except 2.)

But the reality (from what I've read and heard) was different.

The messages were still there, but weren't so strainght, they were hidden. Most of the songs reaquire personal experience with those feelings to truly understand it.

He was ""over it"". Hunting party was the dot after the suffering and whole new chapter began. The depressions weren't that bad and frequent. He was pretty stable (as much as bipolar can be). LP start to work on OML right after Hunting party. OML was supposed to be a summary of the old life and new beggining (that's why ""happier"" genre).

But everything turned around after Chris Cornel passed. All the work, effort and results turned right around and buried him so deep he never had a chance to survive. After all those years he started to believe it will be good again and then this happened. Mike said in some interview Chazy closed himself, he was barely talking to anybody for months. Later it seemed he is getting better, but it was probably a manic phase. At Chris birthday the pain was unbearable even for Chester.

To Minutes to Midnight, A thousand suns and living things:

Minutes to Midnight were different, because band members agreed that they don't wanna do one type stuff. They wanna show everything they've got. (Songs written by Chester which wasn't chosen for the album, was recorded by Chester's side project - Dead by Sunrise. The most of the songs are pretty heavy and in completly different style. I would really love to hear it produced by LP).

ATS. They wanted to focus on world problems not only their own. 

Living things. I don't know the story behind. But I guess that it was what they wanted to do. Calmer and easier style yet sophisticated and deep meanings.

Summary: they don't want to be the same. Chester loved the heavy stuff, but also wanted to do different stuff on each album. It's a pitty he didn't have some other band for heavy stuff."

But in long-time perspective is often 'cause of many problems (""Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."" - Master Yoda.) (True, from personal experience.)

People don't talk about music saving lives, 'cause it's cliche. They don't want to look weak or too emotional or stupid etc. Another thing is as soon as you start to talk about this many people start to think you are something less, because they think you have some mental issues.

After Chester passed I lost everything. It sucked before, but after that it was a whole new level of hell. He was the family I've never had. When family member die, it won't affect me, but this was, what I imagine losing all the closest ones at once feels like.

The advice. If it's strangers then do what you think is right, the worst that can happen is that they won't be responding anymore (same as if you end it). Don't bother with what they think about you, it's their problem.

If it's someone you know in person, but you don't need to be friends (it doesn't benefit you) then be yourself, but limit it so it can't harm you (let them think they know you, be ""ordinary""/""normal"", don't let them know the real you and dangerous info). 

If it's someone who doesn't have anything to do with your career and you want to interact then just be yourself (if you are crazy or something, let them know you part by part, so it's not shocking, terrifying).

Arch Enemy led me to Amon Amarth, Mors Principium Est and Wolfheart. Which led me to death metal - Decapiteted, Bloodbath, Dawn of Disease, Firespawn and tech. Death - Allegeaon

After some time I discoverd Suicide Silence through old BMTH which led me to many other Deathcore bands. Whitechapel, TAIM, Angelmaker, Fit For an Autopsy, Shrine of Malice.

Music (mostly metal) is a huge help with sleeping. It overscream my mind a bit. So try this. Or I watch tv 'til I fall asleep from total exhaustion.

I think that writing it down helped, even on the text is visible slight progress. So maybe try to always write it down.

I found out that pushing yourself to get the work done when you can't focus is pointless. It's better to do some other thing from to do list or just turn off for awhile. 

I make flexible schedule of every day and inflexible of every week. When I can't focus I just do different stuff that needs to be done.

I would recommend you to cut off your family if they are causing some of your issues. I know it's not easy or something you want to do, but sometimes it's the only way. Or at least move out of the city. I did this with my father and I am doing much better since that.

Music helps a bit(I used to think it's bullshit, but I prove myself wrong recently). It's not much, but it helps me sleep, reduce anxiety and stress a bit and to focus a bit more.

Certainly don't give up on boxing. There has to a way to continue. It would be great if you could be a trainer (fitness or anything else, but boxing trainer would be the best). You'd make some money and you wouldn't lose the positive things it brings.

You can make a friend to talk about this stuff here. I've seen few post asking/offering this kind of help. Some people talked about making a sub for it, but I'm not sure if it happend. Get this stuff out usually helps a lot.
