I asked her about Kaiser-covered therapists outside of their facilities, and she basically said that it all depended on the health plan provided by my employer. Sure enough, outside mental health coverage wasn‚Äôt provided, so it would‚Äôve had to been an out of pocket expense. It‚Äôs honestly pretty messed up.

loseit,fpwim23,t1_fpwhux2,1588964100.0,"Getting a mental health assessment and entering a dialogue with a professional is really beneficial, even if you‚Äôre only experiencing mild amounts of depression or anxiety. I have coverage through Kaiser Permanente, which has famously shitty mental health services, and I found that those doctors were very overeager to prescribe antidepressants. 

The medication I was on, along with severe cannabis abuse, led me to have a manic episode which required hospitalization. That‚Äôs how I found out I have a mild form of bipolar disorder. I was on a medication for bipolar for a bit before I went clean off it and focused hard on developing healthy habits that naturally aided my mental health.

I guess my only good advice is to absolutely seek help for mental health if you feel like you need it, and medication can definitely help even temporarily to get you to a good place. But please don‚Äôt do what I did and assume you were cured and stop talking to your doctor. It has to be a constant dialogue. Track your moods, ask a lot of questions, and remember that you‚Äôre doing this for your own health."

Prior to covid, I went through a breakup (ultimately a good choice), and began to focus on basic needs like sleep and movement and social time with friends. I felt my mental and emotional health improving greatly!

Once quarantine began, I figured it was as good a time as any to get back into focusing on CICO and food logging for 1200-1500 cals per day. Happy to report that I started out at 310lbs and am now down to 287lbs! 

Congratulations on your loss and improved mental health, you deserve to feel good!"
GetMotivated,fpegqjr,t1_fpeez45,1588547226.0,"Tracking is super easy once you get into it. Weighing food and measuring portions is important. Also, let‚Äôs be realistic, people aren‚Äôt going to eat just 1000 calories of vegetables and protein. I‚Äôm sure that works for some weirdos, but most of us enjoy a carb or something sweet, and depriving yourself of that just leads to cravings and relapse.

If you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. And it‚Äôs ok for some of those calories to be from processed, sugary, or carb-y sources to satisfy your cravings. As long as you have a deficit and eat relatively balanced, you‚Äôll lose weight.

There‚Äôs too much ‚Äúdiet bullshit‚Äù on the internet. ‚ÄúEat only kale, only egg whites, only bacon‚Äù. That‚Äôs not how humans think or eat, and though they might be able to do that for a couple days, most normal people will just relapse."
