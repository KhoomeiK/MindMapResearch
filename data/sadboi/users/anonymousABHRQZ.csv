stayathomemoms,fl62kjg,t1_fl5lzpq,1584852432.0,I could not wipe my son he had and still have very sensitive skin. We rinsed him every single diaper change. We got used to it. So didn't feel like a problem. Plus we saved a lot $$$_. We only had wipes in his diaper bag in case of emergency.

We are making $1000 a month on this. Not much but is a start. I just began home school so I'm trying to see how I can do both.

Look for reselling ideas videos on YouTube."

homeschool,ewpye5m,t3_cpe1pb,1565652300.0,"I'm getting ready to homeschol my only son 5yo. 

 Our reasons:
Education tailored to my son's interests and abilities.
Learn from real life. Going to the zoo or museum. Traveling and sightseeing. Meeting people. 
Safe place from bullying... And more!!!!
Flexible schedule.
More time with family. 

I left a stressing job to stay home with him. I felt like time was passing by too fast and I was not enjoying him. It was expensive and worrying to have him at daycare....

I've received a lot of pushback from family and friends. But I did a lot of research and I find that this the best I can do for him.

Edit: I have not find a support group or fellow homeschol mom's around here. Only on-line."

Mindfulness,ew7e2yw,t1_ew6ozbb,1565190442.0,"I respect your advice. However, I think the description of what he feels sounds like some depression or other mental illness. It's worth seeing a professional. 

You would not ask a type 1 diabetic to not use insulin and only eat a healthy diet. The second will help greatly, but the person will be at risk of very serious complications. Same with mental conditions.  if there is an underlying mental condition it should be treated first."

depression,evr6irv,t1_evozgs5,1564702367.0,The better I feel the better my memory and concentration is. It's been ups and downs for almost 5 years. In my case a good night sleep makes a world of difference. No more staying up late watching Netflix üò•
depression,evr606u,t1_evp0a5c,1564702155.0,"I do the same but if someone else reads my notes it does not make sense. I write the same way my thoughts are. Random and unorganized.

My first few months of going to therapy, my husband had to take and talk for me. He was able to describe better since we talked so much about how I was feeling.

Also, my therapist noticed and is 100% aware that when I'm feeling the worse I'm confused and can put thoughts and sentences together üò•

I wish you the best. I hope you find a good therapist and most importantly when you find it, don't let go lol"
