But she dropped me as a client because I wasn’t willing to go deeper into the trauma work. I understand it. She is in high demand because she is really good at it but I felt a little hurt because she knows me so well and it’s hard to find therapists that are willing to work with someone with bipolar disorder and a “traumatic background.” I know she’s doing good by helping people that are ready and willing to do the work but the selfish part of me wants her to help me in other ways.

As for the TMS referral. I don’t have experience with it but I have started thinking about it. I have started researching studies but if you find anything interesting or decide to start treatment, I think it would be great if you chronicle it. It might help others too.

Humans have the ability to reflect and we tend to view ourselves through the eyes of others. Back when being a part of a group was essential to survival, we did everything we could to belong. If we didn't feel like we did, we would panic. We are still wired to notice the negative in social relationships more than the positive. Some people are more strongly wired to do this than others. Keeping that in mind, remind yourself of the good you received in your review. It's very easy to focus on the negative especially when already in a low mood.

bipolar,fa8ge3f,t3_e80s8c,1575845907.0,"Hey. I'm sorry you feel distressed. It can be really hard to find meds that work. Even okay working ones like the ones I have. 

One thing I've learned from trying different meds is that it takes some time for the body to get used to them. Some people are really sensitive, others not so much. Some people take longer for side effects to go away and others not so much. 

I really understand your concern about your partner. My concern is always coming across as a  Debbie downer, dysfunctional, or mean. It's hard. Sometimes I am happy to not see my partner, not because I don't want to but because it gives me space to cry and not do a damn thing. Today I have things to do that I have been putting off though. I have a huge pile of laundry that needs to get folded, homework, and some calls. I need to shower again (feels so frequent when sad huh?).

My partner is my best friend and I don't want to frustrate them. It makes me wonder how things will work out when we live together. Lately I have been having days were I cry like I haven't cried in years. The kind that sounds like you've lost someone dear to you. Wailing. No one wants to hear that. 

If you live together, maybe schedule some alone time. He doesn't need to leave your place, just different rooms. Time to be alone and simmer down if you are frustrated or cry alone might feel good (no pressure to look okay so as not to worry him). Frequency shouldn't be often. There's danger in too much isolation. I find that I want it a lot more these days so that is something to be mindful about."

Your frontal lobe shrinks and episodes get worse without treatment. When I learned about that, it wasn't really a hard decision. Really there are so many more benefits that outweigh the negative of side effects that generally last 2 months. Obviously there is a chance the med doesn't work and has bad side effects even after 2 months and in those cases, you just try another combo."

I think not remembering how bad it was happens to a lot of people and contributes to med noncompliance. 

Mood dysregulation is no fun and it is very tiring. Meds help stabilize your moods. Meds change you as in the help you not be all over the place. You are still you, just not emotionally hyperactive or mean or toxic. 

Yes, there will probably be side effects but they usually go away once your body gets used to the meds. This happens around the same time your mood starts improving. 

No one can tell you what to do. It's something you do when you are ready. I was ready just 2 or so years ago but I was diagnosed 8 years ago. One day you just get to a point where enough is enough or you genuinely scare yourself, like I might actually kill myself or hurt myself if I keep going this way. I wanted to be a good partner so I started taking meds. I also want to be a mother so I need to be stable and learn to manage bipolar with meds before I decide to start a family. 

Sometimes it just makes sense. Quality of life can be greatly improved. Also sleep is important. Little sleep like you mentioned is not good for individuals with bipolar, it worsens episodes, and is not good for the body in general."

Be kind to yourself. Do you have tea? A nice tea might soothe your nerves. Draw something. Color. Listen to music. Do something tactile. It might help distract you from thinking about it."

bipolar,f4iwf6z,t3_dkniea,1571610030.0,"Interesting. I'm reading comments and it is interesting that others feel the same. It definitely ties with the grandiosity associated with mania which I have definitely experienced - that increased self-esteem,  confidence, and extroversion. The depression, I would say is more being ""caught up"" in how painful an experience you are having that you are incapable of ""seeing"" others or empathizing. Because of this, you come across as emotionless, self-absorbed, and self-pitying. 

Pretty gross and also sad that I don't realize this until after an episode. C'est la vie?"

Ok, so you're under 18. Good news is that you have plenty of time to search for a new passion. Humans are super complex and the world has so much to offer we can't possibly only be interested in one thing. I started off with music. All I have ever known to like for 20 years of my life. Then I found out I like sorting/interpreting data (weird, wild jump for someone who thought they sucked at math). Those are two very different fields. 

At college, I discovered a lot of different career options. But definitely do your research to find out about other careers in aviation.

As you point out, sorry there is not much that can be done there.

I used to do this a lot and it is only recently that I have slowly started to challenge this way of thinking (a little less that 2 years ago). I was always concerned that X, Y, or Z would give me a depressive episode and it X and Z happened then *for sure I would!* 

This is not healthy and sort trains you to expect the worse and can give you anxiety about life events. At least it did to me. Don't worry about episodes happening. Just be mindful of what an episode looks like for you and get treatment when it seems like an episode is coming on. But don't worry that one *will* come because you don't know that. No one does."
bipolar,f3sf4by,t1_f3sb5pp,1571101824.0,"I thought that too once upon a time. I used crystal healing, went to sound baths, and smoked a lot of weed. Guess what? It didn't heal me! I still have Bipolar I.

Also, it turned out I was pretty much manic during this phase of my life and I don't recall much because shit got weird in my mind and I went psychotic. Anyway, now I take meds and  they're working. Take your meds, man. Your frontal cortex will shrink if you don't and you'll get worse after every episode."
bipolar,f3sbbjx,t3_dhzvg5,1571100047.0,">It was my lifelong goal, to be a pilot. This along with me hating where I live currently is gonna bring my depression back I think.

I am sorry that you cannot be a pilot. Is there any way that you can work in a related field?

About hating where you live, is it the current living situation you are in or the geographic location itself? Does the possibility of moving exist?

You ended this sentence curiously with ""I think"" and began your post with:

>I feel like my depression is gonna come back now very soon.

Are you currently not depressed?"
