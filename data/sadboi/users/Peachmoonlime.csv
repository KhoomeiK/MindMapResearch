In the US, some churches have falsely (in my perspective) enforced the idea that you can only hold allegiance to science or God. As an example, I went to a Christian school that didn’t believe dinosaurs were real because they weren’t in the Bible. Instead of acknowledging that the Bible doesn’t have every single thing listed as an inventory, they chose to push the narrative that atheists invented the dinosaur and it’s all a hoax. 

Some of the best and smartest friends I have are Christians. They show compassion, humility, love, and mercy. They’re not perfect, but they also don’t buy into the bullshit. To me, there is a difference between being Christ-like and being obsessed with the pageantry, rituals, and group-think of American Christian Religion without room for debate.

unpopularopinion,fob3ryg,t3_g6db4z,1587655807.0,"Speaking as a 30-something woman, I’ve never had a friend disparage an ex because of his penis size. I don’t represent all people, but for my corner of the world, I hope some of you may be comforted that when drunken “men are trash” occasions come up, we have no interest in body shaming."
medicalschool,fo9hwkg,t3_g669eq,1587620007.0,"Having lost close friends to suicide, I really sympathize. It is incredibly hard to deal with and act like things are normal. You can grieve these losses and the uncertainty they bring (even if they weren't all close with you, they're part of your community). 

Many of us here in this sub and folks over in r/anxiety and many others are more than happy to be listening ears, but definitely find someone local you can confide in as well, be it a therapist or a friend you trust. It's not a burden to show up for someone who needs support. Don't let that hold you back from speaking up to those around you. I rely on medication, good healthcare support, and friends who know when I am hurting. I have no hesitation in talking about how important seeking mental health was for me. Don't be afraid to get all the help you deserve."

Allergies,fnzphe2,t3_g4u13d,1587398429.0,"It is a really stressful time and that can be very taxing on your immune system and overall very fatiguing. It super sucks. My allergies are a nightmare right now (a big function of where I am quarantined) and I needed my inhaler multiple times this week. I haven’t used it in ages. It gave me major tachycardia which makes me feel SO anxious and heart explodey (not a technical term...). All this to say, it’s a hard time and it’s okay to be pissed at the impact it’s having on you. I acknowledge your rant and I see you!"

GERD,fnw8lmk,t1_fnw2rfd,1587313597.0,"Check this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882397/)  out

For several months I ate and drank nothing hot or cold. Temperature seemed to make the spasms worse. I did all the usual GERD diet stuff like no caffeine or alcohol. I also limited the amount of raw food I had, mushy things were best. I made sleep my mission in life for a while. I was really stressed at the time so took a beta blocker to reduce my sympathetic autonomic nervous system activation (which restricts blood flow to the GI organs). Those are the big things."
GERD,fnv0opz,t1_fnuy4jr,1587276492.0,"They attributed it to damage from uncontrolled GERD exacerbated by insomnia. The radiologist said she had never seen it in that particular way in anyone under the age of 80.... I was under 30 so I didn’t find that super comforting. I also have an autoimmune disease so basically my body reacts very aggressively in all the worst ways. I’m mostly fine now, thank goodness"
