AskReddit,ewdv87n,t1_ewbsc5x,1565308337.0,"Never follow diets that are not suitable for long term. I lost over 40 pounds in 5 months using intermittent fasting and still got to eat pizza and other unhealthy stuff whenever I felt like (obviously not daily, and as long as I counted the calories and made sure I was still eating healthy for the day)

This past months, since I have break from college , I haven't been on a strict diet, or even strict gym/sleep routine. Just a minimum of 3 days a week gym, and eat whatever I want. My target is 2000 cals, and normally I hit it, but  nkw I've been passing it nearly everyday. Some days even up to 4k.

Thing is that my weight is still maintained. I'm not losing weight, but I'm not gaining ahything either. I'll start my weight loss journey again next week as I still have another 20 pounds to shed.

A few years ago, I lost over 20 pound in a month doing an extreme diet. I gained back most of it almost within 4 months after I stopped the diet due to health issues. 

Point being, never go into extreme diets that aren't sustainable. If I had starved myself again this time, I would only be binge eating and probably got some kind of sickness."

No, I don't, that's it. Trying to tell me God will fix my problems isn't gonna help me, and I don't need someone to tell me what this imaginary God has allowed me to feel or think.

If God exists, so be it, if he doesn't, it doesn't matter. In the end I don't give a fuck about it, and given the fact that I was brought up in a religious family, and it took me years to come out of that hole, I rather never think about God at all."

relationship_advice,eu979ox,t1_eu95dlf,1563573335.0,I want to help her because I care about her. I'm giving her the decision hoping she could think about it. Just talking about the problem doesn't seem to help her.
relationship_advice,eu973dr,t1_eu933iy,1563573220.0,"She was staying in a hostel up until now so she kept it under control. In a way I don't think her parents give her enough attention cause even via the call you can tell the difference when she's drunk or high.

That's the thing, she's not partying, she's drinking just to get high. She drank alone today at her friends place (that friend doesn't drink). 

I'm not close with her friends, do you think I'd be able to explain it to her alone? I'm thinking about telling her how it made me feel today and then ask her if she could stop it for me, she could very well say no but I think in that case, that's what is good for me."
relationship_advice,eu91k6p,t1_eu8xq7y,1563569567.0,"Her family doesn't know about this at all or about us either. They don't know she drinks at all.

What other ways can I make her see the problem instead of giving an ultimatum."
relationship_advice,eu91esk,t1_eu8wo1s,1563569470.0,"I don't wanna make it sound like an ultimatum, but idk what else to do. This is not the first time, and everytime I told her the same thing, drink or smoke, just do it responsibly instead of pulling shit like this.

I honestly don't want to end it with her, and I want to help her, not sure how to make her see that she has a problem."

dating,es00fkr,t1_erzzobr,1561461009.0,"No, I've never claimed to anyone that I was a virgin. It's just that people assume it themselves cause I'm an introvert and I usually don't talk to girls casually because of my anxiety. I hope you're right and she'll just laugh with me about the stupid decisions I've made."
dating,es00bzm,t1_erzzevg,1561460887.0,"In total 3 times, I have never even kissed those girls or do any kind of other stuff. Loneliness is one of the reasons and not being able to find someone I truly love was another. Everytime I thought having sex would make me feel better and everytime I just hit myself after. 

I know her and I think she'll fine about me not being a virgin anymore, but I'm just worried about how she'd react that I paid to have sex.

Thanks for your advice, I'll prepare myself to tell her. It'll be hard, but it's harder for me to be with her and feel guilty not telling her."

Like I actually measured my heart rate while speaking about this girl I like to her and told her I was nervous to tell that girl. I think she figured out by then, but eh she didn't say anything but continued hanging out with me.

Told her the girl I like was her after a few hours. Never felt more relieved in my entire life."

What if the girl is single, but recently said she's open to try and date someone, and she's interested in a guy who's likes her and wants to see where it goes with that guy. She doesn't know him well, but doesn't mind it."

dating,er8a4y4,t1_er895fw,1560599992.0,"Thanks, I'm sorry about how it turned out for you.

I know she had a break up in January, just a few months old relationship. When we were drinking the other day and talking about the girl I like, I asked her whether she liked anyone and she said no. That made me a little sad but it was fine, then yesterday she messaged me asking advice about what to say to the guy who told her he likes him. The guy is a friend of her ex, and she doesn't like him or anything, but she feels he seems nice and wants to see where it goes. This is where I actually started feeling bad because my advice is going to be biased, I tried hinting a few times that I'm the wrong person to ask about it.

Two more days, and I'll tell her. Honestly I'm scared haha"
dating,er83ecg,t1_er81haa,1560594954.0,"Did you ever tell the guy? She says the same thing, I tell her that I know for a fact that girl doesn't like me but she says I'll jever know and I could be surprised. I gave her so many hints that its her but I don't think she ever got it. 

I feel bad because I liked her before we became good friends. We worked on a group project and that's when I actually started liking her. We talked then, even texted but nothing casual. Idk how but for some reason we started texting casually last month. Whenever I tried to stop it by ending the conversation, she'll somehow start it again and I couldn't just ignore her."

I think she likes me, if not she won't be messaging me for hours at night, and I mean instant replies, but then sometimes it feels like she doesn't.

I usually don't like girls alot, like I have alot of crushes, but until now have only really liked 2 girls. Never even spoke to the first one because of anxiety.

Maybe I'll ask her out next month, we got a break, if she says no atleast I got time to prepare myself."
