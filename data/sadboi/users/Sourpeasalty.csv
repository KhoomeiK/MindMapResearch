EatingDisorders,fnok8pv,t3_g2z40o,1587127377.0,"Your boyfriend doesn’t have an eating disorder I’m assuming. He’s not looking at you eating through the same lens as you may think he is. He’s not thinking “omg she’s so fat for eating in the morning.” He’s probably thinking nothing about it; and if he’s isn’t thinking nothing about it he should be because there’s nothing wrong with it. Your body is telling you when it needs food, that doesn’t make you a bad or weak person. Your body is saying “hey I need food right now.” If a baby or child told you they were hungry in the morning you wouldn’t judge them; don’t be so hard on yourself. Everyone is different, wanting to eat in the morning depends on your body. Your body is always trying it’s best for you and all it’s asking is for you to give it what it needs and it lets you know when it needs it. I 100% understand where you’re coming from, I hate eating when other people aren’t, but it’s just your ED trying to keep hold of you. It is 100000% okay to eat when someone else isn’t. Don’t think of it as a weakness, think of it as you taking care and listening to what your body needs. In the morning your body is telling you that you need food.

Edit: I just wanted to fix some punctuation."

We rescued her from this person in our neighborhood who didn’t want her anymore, she was a puppy at the time. She was and always have been a very anxious and protective dog. She’s triggered by loud noises and doesn’t even really like when my sister and I ( who lived in the same room at the time) get physically close to one another. She doesn’t like children and is very protective of my sister and I. She has to spend most of her time in our room because she’s not friendly with my brothers, my mom or my stepdad. She doesn’t like anyone coming into our room and  won’t allow our mother to enter, especially when my she enters with hostility. She has always kept us safe and has always made me feel safe, I owe her the world and love her with everything I am. She’s currently 10 years old and it scares me because she just looks so old now.

Everyone has different preferences to different people so you might be so beautiful to one person and the complete opposite to someone else. Personally I don’t see what your talking about and I think you should believe your psychologist. Approaching people is so hard and it’s not easy to find someone for even the most attractive people. It took my best friend who is very attractive a year actively looking to find someone. She’s been wanting a boyfriend her whole life, but never put herself out there because none of us even knew what that meant. I met my bf on reddit and if we ever broke up I have no idea how I’d “put myself out there” . It’s just generally hard to find people and to even start dating to begin with. Someone finds you attractive I promise you. And the “flaws” that you have might not be flaws to other people."
