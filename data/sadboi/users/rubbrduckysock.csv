Extra points if it’s super useless and gimmicky like those portable blenders so you can “make smoothies at the gym!” But you don’t even have a gym membership nor can you afford one

mentalhealth,fnyz269,t3_g4k3mx,1587380957.0,"You could totally drive around! Caring for yourself is as much of a point as anything. Sometimes you do find out that friends aren’t what they have seemed, but everyone is also in a very stressful time right now. Even if it’s just to express how you’re feeling right now, you should message them. They could be feeling very similarly and it might feel nice for you just to make some pointless small talk. You can try to come at situations from a “fair” perspective. “Yes I am risking some emotional stability to reach out to someone who may not validate my concerns, but at the very least I will have talked to someone today and if I can talk to someone in a situation where I’m scared, that’s bravery and progress” and honestly you’ll probably feel better if you’re not trying to “get them to prove they care about you” or “make sure they know you care about them” but just try and have a conversation with someone, that’s all."
mentalhealth,fnyy47w,t3_g4o0dz,1587379996.0,"Alive with an angry mother is much better than the alternative, even if abuse is going on reporting it could not only save their life now but save their whole life. 
I’m sure you’re talking to them right now, try to remind them to breathe (take a deep breath, thing about where the air hits your nose) , ask them to suck on an ice cube, ask them to tell you something about where they are (details, smells, sounds) 
This sort of thing can bring them back to reality, and hopefully de-escalate the situation before anything bad happens. 

Also for your own sake know that this is not your fault, never feel guilty about the actions and feelings of someone else. I can tell you’re doing your best."
mentalhealth,fnyxrmf,t3_g4ne65,1587379629.0,"The light alone from smartphones prevents natural production of melatonin, which messes up your circadian rhythm and sleep cycles. Erratic sleep alone can cause or at least greatly exacerbate mental and physical health issues, even preventing people from losing weight. They’re also designed to be addictive, and often social interaction online can have just as many negative consequences as positive. Obviously they are really useful tools, but like tobacco we couldn’t possibly know the full ramifications of their use until lifetimes worth of research found what the problems were, and nicotine is still a huge issue after millennia of it’s use."
mentalhealth,fnyx1r3,t3_g4pd5c,1587378870.0,"I’m not sure, only OCD comes to mind but I am in no way a psychologist. If you have a good therapist they will believe you and work to get to the bottom of it, anything that bothers you or otherwise impedes you’re life is valid and relevant. If they dismiss you, absolutely keep looking for someone who listens. There’s no use paying someone who isn’t even helping you."
mentalhealth,fnywrwz,t3_g4n7vo,1587378584.0,"Trauma can cause you to deal with stress in unhealthy ways and can make you more sensitive to it for sure. mental health issues in general can even cause physical health changes in your body. If you could reach out to find some sort of therapy that might be ideal. A lot of offices are doing phone call or online sessions now, so i would just look for a local website, see who works with PTSD or abuse victims or anxiety disorders, and just start by sending an e-mail stating basically what you put here. You can see about insurance or other programs covering costs too, and I have heard of offices doing the first session free of charge. That’s info you’ll have to figure out yourself though.

Also, if you feel like your therapist doesn’t treat you fairly or is too indulgent in areas that aren’t where you want to focus, or even if you just don’t vibe, find a new one! 

I hope you’re safe now :)"
Parenting,fnywchv,t3_g4h08k,1587378125.0,"I think what you and even your wife are experiencing right now is beyond even the relatively normal, albeit still incredibly difficult, SAHM problems. I really want to be a SAHM, but am going to school to be an elementary school teacher. right now kids can’t even play with their friends. They’re a mess right now because humans aren’t supposed to develop in one location with no routine and no challenges (or inappropriate challenges). It’s tough for everyone right now, but I feel awful for all these kids who are being forced into taking quizzes and tests online so that a school can get more funding, but are being ignored when it comes to their basic developmental needs. The only thing I can think of is try to mix things up if you can. Keep a steady routine for things like homework time, meals, nap times even. Make a point to spend some time with your wife by seeing if she can schedule in a “lunch break” or something. The kids can definitely get more tv time, but when it comes to playing and interacting with them, try to come up with new ideas or even just put different activities in different rooms. Maybe see if you can work on a project together like drawing a really BIG picture together or making up an extravagant game. If you want to find some weird games you can always look up group acting exercises cause they’re usually goofy! 

I wish you the best of luck!"
abuse,fmb39so,t3_fu51zv,1585917128.0,"I want to say I am so sorry you are going through this. I hope you can get help, end this relationship and move forward. 
Abusers often use a threat like hurting themselves to keep you in control, but anything he does is on him and is NEVER your responsibility. I’ve seen people try to say they would hurt themselves just to control someone compassionate and caring like you and I have never seen anyone actually do something after the relationship is terminated. If you still think he needs help you can recommend therapy, but if he refuses it’s still on him to make those decisions. 
You have control over yourself. you have a right to decide who you want to marry and you deserve something beautiful that makes you happy and fulfilled. Think of yourself as one of your friends, would you let them settle for something that makes them this unhappy? What advice would you give to a friend? There’s no shame in calling off a wedding for much less. I understand it can be embarrassing to make that call to your family, but that embarrassment with be temporary, and staying with someone who treats you so poorly especially when you have a disability is setting up a pattern of long term pain. You certainly could at least postpone with everything going on, find some therapy, and work on just opening up with your family and friends. I hope you’ll find someone who’s in your corner, but remember that you are the one who’s always on your side. be there for yourself <3 
I’d like to think that I’m here for you too, as much as a stranger on the internet can be. Feel free to DM me"

mentalhealth,fisfy2q,t3_f9e4qz,1582684107.0,"I have no clue how I managed to pull this off, but I developed a secondary voice somehow that’s kind of me “mom-ing” myself? It’s like I’ll mess up and already start the process of berating myself in my head and then in comes my other mom voice saying “come on you that’s not true. You just gotta push forward and you’ll get it done” 
Sadly I have to recollection of how I developed this, but I think it had something to do with reading or hearing about treating yourself like someone you love and take care of; like a dog or child. You wouldn’t let one of your best friends feel that way about themselves without a response right? And after a while catching it and imposing your own nurturing voice will become a habit I hope!"
mentalhealth,fimeavl,t3_f8ln3a,1582526881.0,"I saw a really interesting post about stuff like this, but more in reference to anxiety. I wonder if his would help: try to take tiny steps, and come at problems from a different angle. For instance, if you can’t stand the thought of taking a whole shower, just convince yourself to wipe off with a wet wash cloth or even better, baby wipes! If you don’t want to brush your teeth, just use some mouthwash. If the thought of changing clothes is too much, just try and change your underwear, etc. 
if you break things down smaller and smaller until you can get stuff like that done, you’ll start to feel a bit better. Also, if you break it down like “I’m just going to get undressed to wipe off” and then you end up in your bathroom, it would be a whole lot easier to think “okay well... I really just need to turn the water on and stand there...” and boom your all ready basically clean! 
It’s a similar concept to “I’ll just put on my workout clothes” or A really good one “I just need to put my feet on the floor,” it’ll increase you’re likelihood of getting anything done at all, plus opens the door to do more than usual.
Hope this helps a little!"
