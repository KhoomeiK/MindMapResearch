Yeah man, the whole fucking planet was just sitting in grass huts starving to death before the glorious white man came to make sense of it all. 

There were cities larger than any European city with clean streets and drinking water before a diseased load of assholes came just in time for a civil war. The Americans and Africans didn't know how to farm? Why did the first dozen English colonies all die off? Was it because they were so good at farming? 

Go look up what corn looks like in the wild, or what non cultivated watermelon looks like. There were African and Pre Colombian farmers that beat your monk and his peas to understanding basic biology. The natives of the Americas had superior astronomy, could successfully perform brain surgery, and knew how to wash their fucking hands hundreds of years before anyone in England figured it out. 

Not to mention the Koreans circumnavigating the world long before Europeans, and the Pacific Islanders beat them. 

The only difference between these civilizations and Europeans is a love of slavery, conquest, and the aggressive resistance to basic sanitation that destroyed civilizations we have yet to un-bury.

I remember listening to an interview with a man in his 80s who would hunt with his father in the south for sustenance, his father was careful to explain to him that they only hunted for food, and no other reason, and even in their situation taking joy in any living things death was an unacceptable and morally wrong way of thinking or feeling, not just religiously, but in a practical sense, it was inhuman to kill without need or to kill for pleasure. 

That's white Christian traditional values from a man (the father to the 80 year old telling the story) who was likely taught the same from his father reaching back at least 100 or more years in the deep south.
