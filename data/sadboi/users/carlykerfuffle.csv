AmItheAsshole,fr5s0v2,t1_fr51jhc,1589913687.0,Sounds like my aunts. Raised on Hamburger Helper and eat fast food almost daily. They‚Äôre both well over 500 pounds and will likely be dead in a few years.
AmItheAsshole,fr5re3p,t1_fr5i8vg,1589913384.0,"Jesus that sounds just like my mom‚Äôs family.

My grandma and aunts are all 500+ pounds apiece. I guarantee you all three of them will be dead in five years‚Äô time ‚Äî if that. What we are witnessing is basically time-released suicide. My mom is the black sheep of the family in that same sense. Granted, she‚Äôs gained weight after having two kids, but my mom is still active and eats healthy. She can ascend stairs without panting and sit on furniture without breaking it, something my aunts can‚Äôt do. She also developed some issue with her esophagus after her second pregnancy and has to be mega-careful about what she eats to avoid flare ups.

Me, I‚Äôm trying like hell to avoid that same fate but it‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôve always had a ton of textural issues with fruits/veggies (I‚Äôm also starting to strongly dislike the taste and textures of some meats) and I struggle with depression so sometimes I‚Äôm either not eating at all or eating crap. BUT I still actively try to make good choices when I can. My extended family has never touched a veggie in their goddamn lives.

My cousin is 5 years old and he‚Äôs already obese for his age because everyone in the family (including his own parents) stuffs him with food. Meanwhile my mom gifts the boy with books instead of food. Naturally, all of them think my mom is a total weirdo for actually giving a shit about her health, and OP reminds me so much of my family.

Gonna be honest, no slaughterhouse videos or Joaquin Phoenix award show tangent about factory farms or abused animals could possibly make me go vegan faster than seeing those white trash Mr. Creosotes gorge themselves on Hardee‚Äôs and soda pop multiple times a day while my poor mom nearly chokes to death on an ice cube."
