AmItheAsshole,fr5s0v2,t1_fr51jhc,1589913687.0,Sounds like my aunts. Raised on Hamburger Helper and eat fast food almost daily. They’re both well over 500 pounds and will likely be dead in a few years.
AmItheAsshole,fr5re3p,t1_fr5i8vg,1589913384.0,"Jesus that sounds just like my mom’s family.

My grandma and aunts are all 500+ pounds apiece. I guarantee you all three of them will be dead in five years’ time — if that. What we are witnessing is basically time-released suicide. My mom is the black sheep of the family in that same sense. Granted, she’s gained weight after having two kids, but my mom is still active and eats healthy. She can ascend stairs without panting and sit on furniture without breaking it, something my aunts can’t do. She also developed some issue with her esophagus after her second pregnancy and has to be mega-careful about what she eats to avoid flare ups.

Me, I’m trying like hell to avoid that same fate but it’s tough. I’ve always had a ton of textural issues with fruits/veggies (I’m also starting to strongly dislike the taste and textures of some meats) and I struggle with depression so sometimes I’m either not eating at all or eating crap. BUT I still actively try to make good choices when I can. My extended family has never touched a veggie in their goddamn lives.

My cousin is 5 years old and he’s already obese for his age because everyone in the family (including his own parents) stuffs him with food. Meanwhile my mom gifts the boy with books instead of food. Naturally, all of them think my mom is a total weirdo for actually giving a shit about her health, and OP reminds me so much of my family.

Gonna be honest, no slaughterhouse videos or Joaquin Phoenix award show tangent about factory farms or abused animals could possibly make me go vegan faster than seeing those white trash Mr. Creosotes gorge themselves on Hardee’s and soda pop multiple times a day while my poor mom nearly chokes to death on an ice cube."

He also took offense to “Ocean Avenue” by Yellowcard. He thought “sleeping all day staying up all night” was a sexual innuendo. I don’t think the song is necessarily about sex, just about being young and stupid in general. But yeah he was NOT happy that they played that song on Radio Disney.

Unfortunately, I melt like the wicked witch in most work settings. As a result, I haven’t been able to keep a job very long.

I really really hope this pandemic changes how we as a society look at employment and opens the door for more people like me to get good jobs instead of being relegated to “Charlie work,” to borrow from Always Sunny. I understand all work from home all the time is illogical, and that social interaction is required for every job. I am okay with social interaction, I obey social norms and I always show up when needed, but there’s just no reason to keep people cooped up in an office like that.

But maybe that’s just wishful thinking on my part, because the people who call the shots are usually devoid of empathy. There might be a boss who is understanding of a condition like mine, but they’re usually the exception not the rule. Most of them are indifferent at best and downright abusive at worst. I’m willing to bet my living soul we’re gonna go right back to the way things were when this is all over and people like me will continue to be ignored."

So us women folk aren’t capable of appreciating good music and only listen to male artists because we’re horny? Okay thanks.

Of course, this lovely individual didn’t listen to female artists because “that’s gay.”

From the time I was 10 or 11 my mom was obsessed with my weight and watching me like a hawk. She would be like “you know that hamburger isn’t low-cal! If you don’t eat your salad you will end up like your aunts!” I remember when I was 14 she promised to buy me an iPod if I lost 10 pounds. Didn’t work. I remember one time she scolded me at a doctors’ for being a certain weight, like “You need to eat healthy and exercise! You don’t want to end up like your aunts!” Even a few years ago, she gave me a diet cookbook as a gift and frankly I was a little bit offended. Granted, I’m not stick-thin, but I’m not mega huge, either, and I do try to make healthy choices and move around. Regardless, that was extremely bitchy of my mom.

My mom herself has a very bad relationship with body image herself. She always talks about how fat and ugly she thinks she is and it breaks my heart because she isn’t fat or ugly. I’ve never once heard her say anything nice about how she looks, only “ugh I’m so fat, I hate my stomach, I hate my butt, etc.” I wouldn’t want my child to hear me go “ugh I hate my Ringo nose, I hate my pornstar boobs, my skin is so ugly and pale!” so I’m trying to break that cycle now.
