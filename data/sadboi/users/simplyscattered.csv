The main lesson is that they bill by the hour and to get your money's worth you need to honest and upfront, don't hold back on what is bothering you or why it is bothering you. They don't care about your problems as much as you care about your problems b/c they don't have to take them home with them.

Your friend is having a tough time and as long as they are making progress just go with it. It was a huge step for her to reach out to you, she is making progress, take it slowly. If someone with mental health issues is reaching out to others and making active decisions to improve their life please let them move at their own pace as it shows they are comfortable in their decisions. Those with mental health issues almost always, always, keep it a secret b/c of the stigma. Provide a relaxed, judgement free zone where she can express herself when needed. Once she has that base she can build off of it but if you mess with that small amount of progress you'll just set her back.

I've seen several psychiatrists and psychologists, typical answer is to think how sad that would make people and how my dog would be upset. I also get told to exercise, find a hobby, and make new friends. If you think people who kill themselves haven't tried to get better on their own, haven't sought professional help, and reached out to anyone close to them before committing suicide, you'd be wrong. They likely have tried all of the above and gotten nothing positive in return.

socialskills,fg8vu43,t1_fg8olj8,1580630424.0,Good question and I don't know the answer. When people can't relate to one another is it exclusively one side's problem more than the other? If people can share a perspective they will understand each other better. It's hard to relate to people who haven't shared the same burdens or hardships in life. It's just hard to leave your troubles behind like they didn't exist and I think if I could do that it would be easier to relate and get along with those who have had to carry a lighter load through life.

You're gonna need to go it alone for the time being (don't get bitter and cut yourself off) unless there are other family or friends you didn't mention.  Point is you don't currently have the support you need so to get where you want will take extra dedication but it can be done, it just happens bit by bit over a long period of time. Life is change and it never stops. You may feel stuck but you can probably make a list of five things you would like to have done tomorrow, in a week, in a month, in 3 months, and in a year.

selfhelp,ffh9snv,t3_etlfgc,1579927281.0,"Easiest thing to do is think of the progress and payoff from accomplishing the goal (of 2 miles < 17 min). When you think of having to actually do the day-to-day grind I'm sure it causes anxiety, unpleasantness, and even fear and those emotions tell you not to engage in the act b/c it brings physical and emotional struggle. Avoid it and there will be no immediate discomfort. Doing an activity that causes a negative feeling is a struggle so the best advice would be to imagine you accomplishing what it is you want, you're doing something now to achieve something later. Don't focus too much on the moment but the end result. If you truly want to what it is you're aiming for, just focus on the just rewards. It's nothing more than positive reinforcement, don't let the negative de-motivate you."

I know it's tough to care, but if you can't care you may have to find ways to accomplish in academics. Failure in your academic career will only compound your depression, it'll be a friend you lost and you only have yourself to blame. People with depression are almost on empty or close to it and most times it's close to impossible to care so when it comes to things that are important, such as, friends, family, health, academics, career, etc. you will need to find a way to make things happen or at least not fail even in the face of depression because letting the important things waste away breeds misery. I understand you feel as though you can't succeed as you are, you may need to make a new plan or strategy to get through those tough times, to learn new habits and mechanisms to balance out the bad days. That isn't easy, you're changing yourself and your routine and change is difficult and stressful but it is better than the alternative which is to let depression win.

It's hard though. You need to make progress so start to today.

This way, if you can't control the anger, you can at least control the output and not say something you regret. Once the anger subsides, follow up and let them know you don't mind helping them or them asking questions and that if they were upset it was just a moment. If it is general annoyance, simply ask what it is they need and you would accommodate them as best you can. If it is really bad just say you didn't hear and need them to repeat. Be easy with your words, swallow the stress, and then clear the air afterwards if need be.

I was overwhelmed by everything, works, school, friends, chores, etc. until I decided to block everything just to avoid the stress. Only thing that got me was an ex girlfriend and flunking out of college. General constant anxiety is difficult to deal with and takes time to solve. Anxiety is related to fear and stress. That is normal at certain points in life, college exams for sure, but if you can't manage and have exaggerated anxiety to the point where you can't carry on a normal routing on your own there are medications that can help and I would look into if your school has a health center which can help.

You're not unable to say anything, it's just that anxiety or depression have created mindset that dictates your inner monologue making it difficult to integrate with the group. You move at the same speed and live in the same world as everyone else but see and feel things differently, its just you need to be comfortable enough to put yourself into the situation that is passing by. This is hard to do for most people, social skills are a lifetime project for most. I'm not sure how to best tell you to not feel overwhelmed by these social situations, but start slow and start with what you know.

Breaking stride from our parents is difficult but if keeping stride is only hurting you than make a change. What that change is, idk. Maybe volunteer at a shelter somewhere for Christmas to help the less fortunate, I think contributing to the happiness of even people who are strangers might make your holiday feel more whole since you'll be able to share in the joy without the judgement.
