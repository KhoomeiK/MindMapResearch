I try to reassure my mom that I will repay the debt and take care of her when she‚Äôs older but she has BPD and she snaps at everything I say so she yells at me saying she doesn‚Äôt need that.

Who or what framework cites those needs? I dealt with that question a lot lately, and I still am. To others, it seems like I am in a downward spiral. I dropped out of my masters program, but that was me taking control of my life. I was miserable in school but i pushed myself because well, that was the narrative my parents set out for me. I knew if I continued down that path I would be dead by graduation. Not to be morbid, but I‚Äôve had three attempts. 

I actually used to lurk the femcel sub a lot a while back, and I really related to some of the posts. I struggle with love addiction because I thought that would somehow save me and make me happy. It just resulted in heartbreak.
