Anxiety,ff6349u,t1_ff5yujr,1579617934.0,I feel you man :/ you know it really sucks but I really do believe there’s something on the other side of this struggle that we have. Something positive:-) keep going!!
Anxiety,ff4yxw6,t1_ff4yohy,1579575815.0,We will :-)
Anxiety,ff4y69t,t3_ero940,1579575282.0,Sure :-) it’s all kool tho :)
Anxiety,ff4xkju,t1_ff4xb2n,1579574858.0,Not to sound like I’m feeling sorry for you but having the anxiety myself I really feel you dude. Hang in there man idk it sucks :/
Anxiety,ff4wys9,t1_ff4wj5w,1579574443.0,"Now that you have gotten into details I’m sorry to hear that. I usually take this medication but it’s more like just muscle relaxer. I have been in a situation where it was so bad that I had almost tried xanax but thank God I didn’t. Because I would like it so much cause of the help I would felt for taking it then I assume it would be hard to stop taking them. Like withdrawals and all that. Either way man all the best for you and your struggle! Keep going, there’s something on the other side that’s waiting for you. And it’s positive:-) sry for my English tho. Not my native language"
Anxiety,ff4wf88,t1_ff4w5xp,1579574068.0,Agree. Wishing you nothing but the best :-)
Anxiety,ff4wbna,t1_ff4vv67,1579574000.0,"I know I know... But as cliche it may sound, just gotta have that little bit of hope and positivity. Cause that feeling when you like punch figuratively anxiety in the face after facing it and overcoming it in some particular scenario. It’s just gives you hope and positive attitude for the next battle. I just accepted this anxiety as my friend(nemesis) we’ll have to hang. But can’t always let him take the W. Just remember how good it felt after you faced that terrifying emotion. Idk man it gives you hope :-)"
Anxiety,ff4vlwf,t1_ff4v83z,1579573508.0,Yeah man it’s just a battle which seems like never ending one but deep down you know it’s gonna be ok. It’ll pass. :-)
Anxiety,ff4v7ze,t1_ff4uh9c,1579573239.0,It’s so frustrating and frightening at the same time. I’m in my 5th and final year of college and when you must perform and do good on exams then it gets hard. Especially when it’s time to stand in front of everybody and hold a presentation.
Anxiety,ff4un04,t3_ergzqz,1579572841.0,Yeah like other day. Don’t say it’s just Mcdonalds. Despite having anxiety just for you to search and get a job is a accomplishment. And you will go further I have no doubts. Even tho I literally respect every job or craft

Rainbow6,fdffvwt,t1_fdffpv1,1578360742.0,Agree but when solo queuing you really have to rely on yourself and your kills in the most cases. It’s just how it is. In solo queuing if you rely on your ‘’teammates’’ yeah it ain’t gonna be good.

NBA2k,f08tfzg,t1_f08nw8z,1568487619.0,"You know that I go on offense for free throws and that’s literally it. At the VERY beginning of the game I used to shot threes but thats it. Free throws gives me best for shooting points because my open three is 69. Number two on defense Im focusing on blocks, rebounds, good contested shots, tran defense etc. so that’s literally two fields that I’m focusing. Defense and shooting. So yeah budd my comment does make sense. You just don’t know apparently how to ask what are you doing to get points. Svery build is different in its own approach to gaining points on whichever field they wanna focusZ"
NBA2k,f08cdof,t1_f08c8r7,1568479362.0,Stop embarrassing yourself. It’s not even funny. This is hof. Park is all star. Know your facts. MY GUY.

NBA2k,f082w26,t1_f082q5b,1568474095.0,But with the new season I start fresh with zones too right?
NBA2kTeamUp,eztdov2,t1_eztdh7o,1568127855.0,Ill try. Maybe I’d like it
NBA2kTeamUp,eztdept,t1_eztd4fd,1568127660.0,Idk they seemed sooooo slow.
NBA2kTeamUp,eztcyfr,t1_eztcm0n,1568127351.0,Demo.
NBA2kTeamUp,eztcfut,t1_eztc7dw,1568126996.0,And way slower than he was on previous 2k.
NBA2kTeamUp,eztb9eo,t1_eztaf99,1568126164.0,And yeah on top of that when you say you beat me in every defense stat. What is your perimeter def stat? Mines 66. You have terrible stat on that. You can guard the perimeter. Plus with that speed. Just horrific
NBA2kTeamUp,eztapit,t3_d26cf9,1568125767.0,"You have 30 lateral quickness. Do you understand the difference between that and 59? And it’s all about the boxout. Ill crush bad 7’3 with 95 rebound all day long. And again the most crucial thing is speed you’re just too slow. I don’t know hows that not annoying to you. To be that slow. Especially this year 2k f that one up. See I was 7’3 in 2k19 elite 3. But this year the difference in speed. My god just terrible. But with this build you can literally defend, rebound and shoot. Like bruh."
NBA2kTeamUp,ezta9n4,t1_ezt9zqd,1568125458.0,"Ok but I got 91 block, 90 defense, 87 reb I have 59 almost 60 lateral quickness and then 69 open three 73 mid and finishing is decent too. Plus hof shooting badges and defense badges. Post move lockdown and intimidator on hof just crashes every big that tries to score on me because they think they can bully me cause of the height."
NBA2kTeamUp,ezt9wq8,t1_ezt9syn,1568125201.0,Well Id assume you play rec because that build is just not that good for the park. Yeah true but I play 3s too.
NBA2kTeamUp,ezt9sbg,t1_ezt9mh6,1568125111.0,For rec yeah that build is good. You have literally one job. Rebound
NBA2kTeamUp,ezt9qmw,t1_ezt9mh6,1568125077.0,You are playing the rec only right? Im a park guy. 2vs2
NBA2kTeamUp,ezt9kg5,t1_ezt8ne4,1568124953.0,Plus you literally cant shoot even if it depends your life on it. Just not good build 7’3 this year.
NBA2kTeamUp,ezt9f51,t1_ezt8ne4,1568124845.0,You out rebound 70 ovr. You ain’t doing that to a 6’11 90+ with hof badges. You gotta realize my guy that 7’3 is just horrible slow. It’s not even funny like I said how slow they are.
NBA2kTeamUp,ezt5qx3,t1_ezt5lb9,1568122041.0,I got 59 lateral quickness. And I can out rebound 7’3 glass. And they are SO slow it’s not even funny.

NBA2k,ezfls73,t1_ezfliyu,1567879366.0,Is it gonna make it worse tho? Will it be better if I shoot slower in the park and let the defender the chance to contest my shot? Talking about ‘’use your brain’’
NBA2k,ezfl5kp,t1_ezfkicw,1567879139.0,Read the post again please and you will understand why I said:’’stop embarrassing yourself ‘’

Anxiety,eynkb24,t3_cxk3h7,1567250800.0,Never judge or look at someone with disgust just because they are going thru something. If you ever needed someone to be your guidance thru pain and suffering don’t ever judge someone else that’s going thru similar thing.
Anxiety,eynjkz0,t3_cxupud,1567250084.0,Hi :-) sorry to hear about that man. I know that everything I say to you or peace of advice I’ll give you or someone else here you probably told you yourself but I feel you and trust me it’s gonna pass the pain and suffering. Everybody’s different and they cope with themselves in their own different way. Just trying to let you know that your are not alone. I can’t give you the cure or some formula/advice that will cure you immediately. Sometimes you just need to talk to someone. Im here if you want to. But hang in there :-) peace
Anxiety,eymrl89,t3_cxhxyf,1567217791.0,It’s all good man don’t let other’s words affect you that much. As long as you know that your conscious is clear basically that posts and rude words are their actions and it says about them not you. Sorry to hear about your anxiety I have one too pretty bad.
