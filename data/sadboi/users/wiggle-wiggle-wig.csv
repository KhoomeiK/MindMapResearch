EatingDisorders,fj5jcr7,t1_fhx7cv7,1583034141.0,I commented one above but I also relied ALOT on others. I’m not sure about you but I’m New Zealand we heals support groups and I’d go every week just to vocalise my pain and talk. It’s hard only the first time. Gets more and more empowering to speak every tome I went
EatingDisorders,fj5j72e,t1_fhwsvzo,1583034025.0,My coping mechanisms come from sayings. I had a diary that I wrote my favourite lines in. What actually pushed me to change was the saying in the post “feed your mind”. Because I couldn’t preform underfed at all. I read those lines every day before bed 😊
