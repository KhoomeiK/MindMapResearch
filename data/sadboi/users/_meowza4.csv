BassCanyon,fiz17jv,t1_fiywhzb,1582851716.0,"That's an amazing video, truly. He covered basically everything specific I had in mind. I cannot stress enough though his point on when to put ice on your cooler... If everything is sealed in a bag/container/factory sealed, it's okay to put ice in before hand, I made the mistake two years in a row of making wraps for the weekend and not sealing them correctly (only seran wrap) and they got drenched and gross before our first night. Lunch meat, sliced cheese and tortillas is also what I used for them. I'd recommend baggie or plastic container storage!! I also found out WinCo does NOT charge for tiny condiment packages you can find near their deli, so I grabbed a lot of mayonnaise and mustard packets that were small enough to store in cooler. 

Also on the topic of coolers, buy dry ice. Then you wrap it in a paper bag and honestly that'll last you 2-3 days before you have to buy ice (at the Gorge its quite expensive IMO). It doesn't have to be alot as that'll keep everything nice and chilly!!!! I second the bread and bring peanut butter, crackers, dried fruits, fruit snacks, granola bars and snacks of the like are PERFECT for munching. For breakfast you can also add dehydrated hash browns to the mix, first year my friend brought them and it changed the game!!!! We also bring Gatorade and this herbal supplement called 5-HTP for the mornings after you've had fuuun the night before, helps improve the mood and desire to function a little bit!"

BassCanyon,fiy402g,t3_fah19f,1582832057.0,"Hello! 2 yr BC vet at your service as well as many paradisos past... These are great questions!! 

For general (GA) camping ... Think like District 9, lots of commotion/after parties still up and doing there thing. Bathrooms are all port-o-potties and they have them regularly spread out through ALL campgrounds pretty close walking distance no matter where you are. Showers for GA are gonna be rough unless you shower late after the show or plan to get up early as heck to beat the line - every year so far the line for GA showers cuts through driving space and the commons/food court. Obviously this is going to be your cheapest priced option!

For Premier (my personal go to) ... Gets decently full due to still having some of the party aspects and fun post-show but I'd say you run into a 80-90% more respectful group who are more willing to lights off between 2-3am in respect of those trying to sleep. It has private showers (as will the tiers higher than this) that don't get obscene lines until you hit between 10a-2pm but my group has consistent luck before 9am with zero lines!
This option has a private shuttle service that is actually extremely convinent especially if it's hot and you don't want to waste energy. Caution!! These lines do have a tendency to get heavy as there are always desired set times about mid afternoon that lots want to see, but in reality those line waits DO NOT compare to GA showers b/c they're infinitely much faster. This tier IMO are always reasonably priced!

Gold ... From what I have heard this is also a great experience, this site is actually a lot closer to the venue itself with also its own private showers and shuttle service (I cannot give you good shower time estimates here as I've never camped here) from friends who have they enjoyed the more isolated area and I'm willing to bet the lines for showers/shuttle is even less than Premier!

Terrace ... The most expensive option, but you get your own private areas, a FANTASTIC view over the canyon as well as the bonus of your own showers - but I think they share a shuttle service with premier! The two sites (Terrace/Premier) are relatively close to each other with Terrace being much much closer to entrance area.

Easy Camping ... I have little to no knowledge on this one as no one I know has ever had to use it. Best perk I can remember off the top of my head is you get to take home what they supply.


Edit: info on Terrace space - not sure how large the spaces actually are - don't want to mislead anyone. I would also heavily advise people to go to basscanyon.com or even join Bass Canyon Fam on FB! I believe Excision is actually a member in that group and the people are pretty helpful and respectful!"

I also will take a bath and listen to my favorite music while my phone is on do not disturb so I can enjoy peace (doesn't have to be a long bath, I've soaked for less than 15mins and felt better) or even a shower helps me feel I've washed some of the burden off of me."

I used to fight with my own step dad like this just a little younger than you (14-16y/o F) and he was constantly screaming his face red about how disrespectful I was. I would calmly sit there and tell him how ridiculous of an ""adult"" he is for not even being able to listen to my side of things. I eventually got kicked out for my ""attitude"" which was really just me standing up for the toxic/abusive things they said and did to myself and little brother (4-6y/o M)

I fortunately have a good ending as after kicking me out they (my mom wasn't great either) straightened up their own attitudes and how they needed to parent. 

Bottom line, you're so NTA, adults who constantly power play their children, step or not are always out of line. That's beyond unacceptable to treat any aged child like, especially one as yourself who seems to be relatively responsible.
