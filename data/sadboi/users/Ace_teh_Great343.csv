It’s really good, the roster is hella big especially between the third and fourth game. All your favorite characters are there and the story is to the point and doesn’t take long for the player to understand what’s going on. If you want to get all of them at the same time, wait until the fourth game comes out because idk if they’re gonna release the Legacy collection which has all of the games + DLC on the eshop or a physical game

Edit: I will rate the third game, it would be an 8.5/10

The reason being is that I didn’t play the third game as much as I did the fourth one, even getting the season pass for it. The fourth game is incredibly good, which is why I’m hella excited to hear they announced a release date for the game (I think)
