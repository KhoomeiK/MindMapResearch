It's been 5 years and I'm miles away from them but it still feels like I'm being abused by them. I wake up each night with nightmares similar to how I woke up to them hitting me as a kid. And everyone around me expects me to have gotten over it and it makes me feel like I don't have a right to be mad anymore, like I'm using it as an excuse, and it's been long enough and I should be fine. It's what upets me the most, it's been so long and I'm still being fucked over by it. What if it never goes away? How do I explain to people that I'm broken cause of the first 15 years of my life, even when I'm 30? At some point, you can't use it as an excuse anymore but that doesn't mean the symptoms have gone away."

Me: maybe an ""it's okay"" or a ""you'll be fine""? Something to show you care?

There's really no sense to this. 

Country doesn't have to have starved for you to get fucked. The people with extra and the people with none would shift, and you would be in the position of those you're killing. See the thing with scarcity, is that eventually, shit runs out for everyone. 

Also, I'm fine, luckily I live in a town with sensible folk and don't have the issue of panic buying. People still try to limit going outside, so they buy a reasonable stock amount, there's always supply, no one's suffering and no one eventually will  ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌"

I mean you're gonna run out of your stock soon, what happens when the effects of panic buying affect you and your family? If you can't care about those around you, you're eventually gonna fall along with them.

I guess you have a point in that some people will always panic buy but in the same vein that some people will always try to get their carryon if a plane was crashing, or run back into a fire to save their stuff. i.e some people will always do stupid shit, there'll always be dumb people doing dumb stuff that puts them and everyone around them at risk, the idea that ""these people exist so I should do this same"" is ridiculous"

There's no need for you to panic buy things like hand sanitizers and disinfectants.

What about those with immune deficiencies who literally need these disinfectants to live and now can't get even a single bottle? Is the fear of running out, really worth their lives? 

In the long run, you'll end up hurting yourself and your family, and in the meantime, you'll be hurting others, there's no benefit from this.

I think the part that confuses me most is that, panic buying is the source of your issue here. ""Was a smart move cause stores are empty"" but stores are empty because of your ""smart move""

I don't wanna call anyone out, just trying to explain that, you don't need to do this. Your family and you will be fine if you buy reasonable amounts, and that way other families will be okay and people who need this can survive.

I'm not sure if the same is happening with food but I'm aware of it happening with other items. 

You say it was smart cause stores are empty but stores are empty cause people panic buy large unnecessary amounts, which leads to low supply which leads to more panic buying. It's sort of endless cycle isn't it?

And now other people can't have these items, and in cases like disinfectants, a lot of people need it to survive, so isn't it sort of selfish and harmful to everyone?"
AskReddit,fkcjmjm,t1_fkcipy9,1584054486.0,"Yeah but supply is low cause of people panic buying, and that just leads to more panic buying. I understand holding a decent amount but I don't get buying more than you could need to the point where no one else can have any"

Assuming I made a post on being on the edge, receiving an upvote would feel like they're saying ""Yes, I agree do it"" while a downvote would come off as ""This is a bad idea"".
In certain cases the reverse has been true. Most times I interpret any voting as support.
This is why I personally just don't upvote or downvote posts here. I think commenting is far more helpful.
I can't imagine seeing a post on someone saying they're about to kill themselves and then upvoting it. I'd feel like I'm encouraging them to do it.

The abuse didn't come from a transition, it was normalized behavior where I'm from. The good and bad happened simultaneously.
It's hard to separate two things so closely entangled with each other"

Whether it's a hard to supress moan, a boner, staring or just getting touchy without realising.

You'd think for a control freak, someone being unable to control themselves, especially in a public or embarrassing setting, would put me off but apparently that's my sexual weakness."

I can't imagine what they'd go through if something ever happened to me, the pain, the confusion. I can't put them through that and I never will, I refuse to. I just can't... Is what I keep telling myself."
AskReddit,epkpeol,t3_buz6lq,1559278568.0,"-He'd brag to me about how much of an asshole he'd been to people around him

-Accuse me of hating him when I didn't reply within a few seconds

-Emotionally manipulate me and our friends, threatening suicide or self harm when we got upset, or didn't give him what he wanted

-Clingy and borderline possessive


This kept going and eventually I broke it up and decided we should just stay friends. And then:

-Kept insisting we were dating both in private and to others and later claim he was ""just joking"" 

-And when I finally decided to call a full on quits, no more friendship, no nothing, he began harrasing me online randomly, harassing people who spoke to me and slandering me to others behind my back"
