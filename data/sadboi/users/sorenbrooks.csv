BPD,fn8k21q,t3_fzwrh9,1586743424.0,"I mean I do understand wanting to be wanted; it both fills our hole of emptiness and satisfies/relieves our fear of being alone/abandoned.

But I find myself more likely to fall in love with passerby’s just by how they talk to me, walk past me, or by how they hold themselves — I guess it’s not as manipulative; it just sucks going through a world where you’re falling in love with all this beauty and nothing reached out of the void to love you (in that same kind of intensely free-flowing way)."
MalesMasturbating,fn34mh5,t3_fz4iv0,1586612713.0,Feels like a waste with no one here to lounge.
BPD,fmipa9x,t3_fvex58,1586114148.0,"Yeah. I have definitely felt the “ego” level up as I’ve sought treatment and tried medication and meditation. I feel like I used to be very meta aware and sad, now I just don’t know and people still hurt me and leave me thinking I am one thing when I am not. I used to think they’ll come back and I’ll really show them a cold shoulder.

It’s all the same bullshit narrative in my head going over and over. This then that then this then that.

So, I will do nothing. Sometimes that’s the answer. Sure I feel hurt and pissed, but I know those feelings fade. So I don’t dwell, I just live."
BPD,erzk4cq,t3_c4x5zd,1561438706.0,"this was really well thought out and logical, because I do feel like if they are my colleague they’ll support my move. 

Thank you!"
BPD,eri7i0i,t1_eri5dvm,1560891141.0,Look for a clinician who utilizes DBT and has for years. Checking out their ratings never hurts.
BPD,er3ne16,t1_eqsl100,1560467541.0,Thank you! I am ready to connect with that inner peace.
BPD,er3ncsr,t3_c0bm4s,1560467512.0,"You can’t break the cycle unfortunately, but you can come to love yourself and grow to be extremely compassionate during the crisis.

I, too, experience life similarly. If there’s a moment of peace it’s usually the interim between the wake of a resolved situation and the looming onset of another catastrophe. There’s something that can be worked on here that’s two-fold. A) the mindset that we are always just away from the next happening, nuclear fallout, oh sh!t moment, and B) that other “typical” people don’t experience the same cycles of up and down.

If we can shift our mindset to one of: “this is life. Life comes in waves. There are bumps on the road of life. Just because I’ve gone over a bump it doesn’t mean smooth sailing, but rather is a part of the up/down flow” I think we’ll be a lot more content/happy/at least peace. What I’ve noticed with my BPD is to manage my expectations. It’s unfortunate realistic to expect roses and daisies and sunshine always. But that’s not an inherently bad thing. Without the struggle and low how could we ever know or come to appreciate the good. And it’s all good because it’s all part of the process. It hasn’t claimed you yet. You’ve been through it and survived numerous times. Maybe trust that you will again when the worst comes back up.

I hope you find comfort in this. You’re on the path my friend. Keep it up and just be so compassionate in those moments. The moments of self hate and doubt and hardship are when you are most deserving of your own compassion."
BPD,eqsujyb,t1_eqsr6hr,1560294183.0,I have headspace and I have it remind me to meditate everyday at noon — but I’m not the best at it. No judgment but I’ll jump back into it. This community is pretty sweet — I feel fortunate for us.
BPD,eqsqexl,t1_eqso7p1,1560291109.0,thank you! I’ve never heard of low tension meditation so I’m going to try it xx really your words mean so much to me
