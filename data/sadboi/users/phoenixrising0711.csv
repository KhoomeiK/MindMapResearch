And honestly, if someone wants a boob job, why not? If someone doesnt like their nose and will get increased confidence, go for it!

Just like any addiction, someone who is addicted to plastic surgery needs to be cut off and in therapy. But the very few people who do develop addictions do not outweigh the good that the industry does as a whole"

It was so insensitive and quickly tiring to watch their Woah is me pissfest. Especially considering how skewed towards an elderly population that specific condition can be. While people our age grew up with digital literacy skills, the elderly didn't receive that kind of education, and don't necessarily know not to trust everything these people say online. There was more than one occasion people had to clarify to a recently diagnosed older person that they won't necessarily need a port or they won't always feel awful and could get better and maybe they won't even need medication. There were so many older folks trying to balance maintaining living alone and dealing with this condition, just trying to get genuine advice, and were completely trampled on by OTT behavior and it was really sad.
