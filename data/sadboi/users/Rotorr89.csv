Hi. I‚Äôm new to the sub and came across your post and connected with it. 

A little about me: I went to school for natural resources and work in a park. I love it. In my spare time my energy sometimes feels scattered. I like spending time in the garden, reading, crocheting, painting or creating something in some fashion. 

I love second hand book stores and can never leave one without buying an arm full of books. I love reading a good romance novel. Since the pandemic started I decided to try and read through my library as I have a bad habit of buying books before reading through the ones I have. 

I love cooking and am deeply enjoying the free time. To be honest I‚Äôm a home body so I‚Äôm finding this situation pretty satisfying and am eating a lot of good food. Reach out if you‚Äôd like to be pen pals."

They started asking all the personal questions about our relationship and when we wanted kids. They were super judgmental over the fact that my partner and I were ‚Äúmarried‚Äù but not on paper (because neither of us believe in that shit) and that neither of us wanted kids. Needless to say, we did not care to hang out around them anymore. 

Fast forward, they get pregnant and ask our mutual friend to invite me and my partner to their baby shower. Not even an in person invite. A bit later, closer to their baby shower date, I run into the husband while I‚Äôm with my friend and he starts heavily hinting at different gifts they need. Clearly my friend was uncomfortable and stated she‚Äôd do what she can. I just stood silent.

 you handle it by giving yourself what you need. If he is not providing support or comfort then take time for yourself and go to a place or a person who is available and when you‚Äôre in a clearer headspace you can come back to your relationship and resolve those concerns. 

You can not force him or demand it from him, but you also should not deny yourself what you need. 

There is nothing wrong with taking time away from a partner for self care reasons. 

Right now you‚Äôre grieving. It‚Äôs your process. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. No matter the type of relationship, loss is hard. Take your time, go through your process on your time and give yourself what you need and set aside guilt for feeling how you feel. Guilt serves no purpose.

You don‚Äôt sound like a bigot at all you sound like a husband desperate to find middle ground.

Seek marriage counseling. If she refuses then seek it for yourself. 
I‚Äôm sorry this experience is causing resentment both in your personal circles and towards an overall social movement and I understand why. You‚Äôre being taken advantage of and this sounds like a manipulative situation. 

Always remember: boundaries are the distance between you loving yourself and you loving the other person. If loving the other person is causing you to hate yourself and deplete your energy then give yourself space. There is nothing wrong with that. 

Again, offering up marriage counseling may be the best step you can take.

I‚Äôm not sure if your background (religious beliefs/cultural beliefs) but my mom went through this phase when I and my other sisters became teenagers. 

For my older sister she was so intense. My older sister would purposefully rebel and be petty because she hated the rules. To this day she‚Äôs still like that with my mom and despite the fact that she‚Äôs older and my mom has changed she‚Äôll still treat her like that. 

When I became a teen our lives were in a completely different place but she still tried following the same path. I chose to do something different, I sat down and talked to her. It wasn‚Äôt a one conversation deal where it all changed but I realized I had to understand my mom as a person.  My mom had a hard life and dealt with trauma. I also explained to my mom who I was. I was working full time and still going to school. I didnt have time to do stupid shit and if I did go out I would be honest about it. Yes we fought but our relationship changed when I made effort to talk to her like an adult. 

I don‚Äôt suggest being petty, rebellious or passive aggressive. Your mom is a person and this is coming from somewhere. Try to be understanding and talk with her. Explain your needs. Write them out and read them to her (I do this when I feel like my emotion is too much but I need to say what I need to say)

On the grand scheme of things your time in her house is so short. Soon you‚Äôll be on your own. I hope during this times your memories aren‚Äôt full of disdain for your mom but instead you both spending time (and you feeling secure.)

When I was your age I remember discovering a lot about myself in regards to habits. I knew what I wanted but I always felt frustrated because i didn‚Äôt know how to get there. I felt I compared myself to others a lot to try and understand (and it made me anxious.)

Two things I‚Äôve learned about myself. I can‚Äôt study in absolute quiet. I had to have background noise. I chose one show (had to be dubbed cause subbed was a little too much for me) that I‚Äôd watch every semester throughout college during my study time. I also learned that I‚Äôm a writer and need to write out notes while I study. If i wanted it to stick I had to write it out. I feel like writing it out helped my brain focus on the info rather than the background noise and the background noise just kept my brain from racing. 

The rest of my early 20s was me changing/altering habits through rituals. Repetition is key to instilling good habits so creating a ritual is important. I learned that I have to ‚Äúget shit done‚Äù immediately. I know that if I get off work, go home and sit down I‚Äôm not going to the gym lol! So after school or work that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôd do. Go to the gym. Same with studying for me. If being in your zone of comfort makes it hard to self initiate go to a coffee shop or even a friends house or stay at school for at least 30 min to recap your classes. 

These things helped me. Over time my habits have changed to accommodate being an adult but I still enjoy indulging in anime and gaming when I know I can.

polyamory,fka694g,t3_fhau34,1583994074.0,"When I met my now ex husband I explained I was poly. I specifically asked about open relationships cause I know myself and I wanted to start off in honesty. 

For 7ish years I was committed to him and loved him deeply. For those 7 years I did not feel any connection or want to be with another person. Then one day, I did. 

So I brought it up. At first, he jumped on it as if the idea of him dating another female was exciting. He literally logged onto Facebook to change his status before I was even done talking. I continued to foster the relationship I was developing with the other person. 

Eventually he got upset (personally I think he wasn‚Äôt able to find anybody to date) and stated he didn‚Äôt want an open relationship and gave me an ultimatum. He stated he was monogamous and wanted the relationship to ‚Äústay‚Äù that way. 

That broke me. 

At this point my feeling for this other person were strong but My love for him was still there and unchanged. I felt betrayed, misunderstood.

We broke up, got back together and tried again but he would make small passive aggressive comments that wore me down to the point where I didn‚Äôt recognize our relationship anymore. 

I felt devastated because I had talked about who I was from the start. Mono-poly relationships need understanding and inner security from both people. Eventually we ended our relationship but are on good terms. 

Personal advice: don‚Äôt feel afraid of being who you are. I went through a time of guilt that led to anxiety until I realized I‚Äôm fighting to be something I‚Äôm not for someone else. 

Something that helped me was writing it out. Journaling it. Stating what I felt/needed/wanted and being 100% honest with myself. 
I felt this helped me be honest with him as well. 

I wish you the best on your journey and trust you‚Äôll find the guide you need.

Edit: I will/should say this: those 7 years were amazing. I would not trade them for anything. I cherish the time I had with him because not everything is forever. We grew and evolved together.
Sometimes people are brought into your life for a season and that‚Äôs not bad. Don‚Äôt forsake the time with him because of uncertainty about what may happen but don‚Äôt lose sight of who you are either."
