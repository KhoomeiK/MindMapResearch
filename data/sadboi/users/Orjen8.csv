I have some of the same problems as you. My anxiety is almost gone since Iâ€˜ve been put on psychiatric medication, I think itâ€˜s mostly due to my antidepressant (Prozac). Try to see a psychiatrist, sometimes medication can save your life. I still have trouble sleeping sometimes and one thing that helps me fall asleep lately is Melatonin. I take 15 mg at a time and it usually puts me to sleep in half an hour. Another thing that can help me sleep is 5-HTP. Try taking more CBD oil or in a higher concentration. Passionflower extracts also help with anxiety. Other things that soothe anxiety: Magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin D3 in a high concentration taken daily. Good luck and donâ€˜t lose hope, there are solutions out there."

I assumed that it mostly applies to underweight anorexics who perceive themselves to be overweight. I, however, have an overweight BMI and thatâ€˜s what I perceive my body as: overweight. So I think my perception of my own body is accurate. I know I am not obese (yet) but I consider my current weight and state of my body as extremely undesirable. Whatâ€˜s more, I was 20 kg thinner when I first met my current boyfriend so I can only imagine what he thinks of my body now, even though he never criticises it. But the steep decline in his sex drive coincides with the start of my weight gain and no matter how much he denies the correlation, to me (and I think objectively) the connection is crystal clear. I canâ€˜t blame him. If he put on 20 kg I am not sure how attracted to him I would still be, sexually speaking."
