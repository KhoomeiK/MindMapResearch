Wigs,fineof0,t3_f8qi9c,1582562009.0,"Make up after. Be intentional If you want you hair out to show and blend or not then don’t change mid stream. Once have glue on, place the wig and then a scarf tied down to keep it tight for 10 min while do make up. Last thing if you are showing your natural hair is a bit of concealer on an eyeliner brush in very small dots to blend edge."

It is a fact evidenced far beyond simply calculating it... like we can see the damn thing from space and it is round .... and then there is this whole gravity concept that goes out the window.  Where are those other planets and sun going? 

‘Belief’ is for something that cannot be evidenced that requires a leap of faith, like the existence of a God or ghosts or even that your ex’s mother is satan’s mistress. But the shape of the earth is a fact. Not a belief. 

BTW, my neighbor is a flatearther and she’s nuts. She could have been in this show."

depression,f4ufhrm,t1_f4u5bhl,1571808537.0,"Memory loss from trauma is a different thing but very real as well. In trauma the brain is flooded with adrenaline for fight or flight and corresponding amounts of cortisol to calm you into the hippocampus which when there for a period of time is toxic to brain synapses and you experience memory loss until those synapses can regenerate, if they do at all. When I had trauma, I had memory loss and challenge for 9 months and when it came back it came in chunks. Very different from depression where it is more that the brain doesn’t engage to store the memory at the time or isn’t engaged enough to draw on it."
