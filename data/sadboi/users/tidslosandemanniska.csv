Anxiety,ff33gpx,t3_erdbtw,1579532704.0,I feel the same way. It sucks to feel like you wasted your youth because of social anxiety.
Anxiety,fcuugmm,t3_ej14g9,1577988748.0,"Yes, I developed anxiety and selective mutism too when I was really young and don't remember a time when I didn't have it. It has always been normal for me so I don't know who I am without it."
Anxiety,fb1n7ik,t3_eb2boz,1576438731.0,It's really great that you are doing this! I had selective mutism myself when I was younger so I know how difficult it can be. I hope things Will work out well for you and that you can Will get better. You can do this!

socialanxiety,f89y5ig,t1_f89b84v,1574382876.0,"Exactly how I would do it too. If I didn't I would probably have forgotten everything I was supposed to say and mess it all up, so even if I got a worse grade it was worth it."
Anxiety,f66kfrm,t3_dql1pe,1572711771.0,I relate to this so much :/
Anxiety,f37k53g,t3_dfzq4a,1570726869.0,"Congrats, that's really great that you were able to win over your anxiety in that way. Thank you for giving all those tips aswell, I feel like they could be really helpful."
Anxiety,f335d6v,t3_df8jbi,1570632063.0,This is what I fear the most when talking to someone honestly. That I Will just be paralysed and not be able to say anything.
Anxiety,f2wbaf0,t3_dek2lo,1570463666.0,"That's amazing! You should be really proud. Don't worry about crying, I bet therapist see a lot of that. When I went to my first therapy session I couldn't stop crying the entire session which was embarrasing but it went better the other times. Just push yourself and keep going."
socialanxiety,f1vus85,t3_dawzgv,1569776193.0,Very relatable
books,f0ynprs,t3_d79ryv,1569073914.0,"I only really like to read in a quiet room by myself. 
Sometimes in the Summer I might read outside on the beach or find a quiet place in the forest to just sit down with a book. Tho my favourite place/time to read is on a balconey when it's sunny and quite warm outside, sometimes while having something to drink or snack on at the same time. Those are just perfect moments."
socialanxiety,f0te9xr,t1_f0tbjnv,1568920581.0,"Well, I Still have quite a lot of social anxiety but I feel like it has gradually gottrn better over the years. Lately I've been trying to focus on recognising my negative thoughts and try to not put any value to them.. if it makes sense. Generally I don't really think about making enough eye contact, it all kind of comes natural."
Needafriend,f0t31em,t1_f0swsyw,1568915077.0,That's great. You're very welcome over here :D
Needafriend,f0svxlz,t1_f0sszkg,1568911501.0,Du skriver bra! Some grammatical errors but otherwise I'm impressed. Why did you want to learn Swedish?
socialanxiety,f0spuw9,t3_d6b975,1568908732.0,Happy to say that I can't relate that much to this anymore
socialanxiety,f00xptk,t3_d36gq7,1568307899.0,I know how you feel but I think there's probably a lot of people that don't want to be friends with the most interesting of charismatic people. Different people like different people. Everyone is worthy of friendships.
socialanxiety,ezwltxw,t3_d2pmv2,1568219644.0,"Yeah, when you're around people that effortlessly talk and interact with others it's just a reminder how you are not like them."
socialanxiety,ez95z2n,t3_d0dwk8,1567773977.0,I'm in almost the exact same position... also 20 and never had a relationship or even Close. Feels like I'm just missing out on part of life.

AskReddit,eyz7mzs,t3_czm1xu,1567611438.0,"Some books that I've read and recommend are: 

My brilliant friend by Elena Ferrante 

Never let me go by Kazuo Ishiguro 

The muse by Jessie Burton (aslo The miniaturist by the same author is really good)"
AskReddit,eyz79p2,t1_eyz5a7j,1567611196.0,"Yes, I really like this book. I recently read the second book in the series 'The girl in the tower' and it was really good to."
socialanxiety,eyqbcuv,t3_cy6y41,1567335639.0,Yes! I feel this all the time. I'm 20 now and I feel like I haven't done those things I should have done as a teenager. And who knows if I'll be able to live out my 20's properly.
introvert,eyhym8x,t3_cwzcfv,1567094707.0,I've tried this app before and it was good that you didn't feel the stress of having to reply right away. I've had some good converations on there but most people I've talked to stopped responding after a few letters. For me personally it was a way to practice being more social but I didn't really feel like I could grow a proper friendship out of it. But maybe that's just me. It's a good app to try IF you want to have some converations from People all over the world.
socialanxiety,ey8qqq6,t3_cw5jfo,1566926180.0,"I know that it seems really scary and new now but  it probably won't be as bad as your mind can make it seem. One way or another you will survive. And soon you Will get in to the routine of things and your anxiety Will ease. If it seems too much for you, my tip would be to take it day by day. Just think about going through your first day and congratulate yourself for going no matter how the day went. Then after that you focus on the next day of the week and so on until you feel more comfortable. Hope this makes any Sense. Good luck."
AskReddit,exxyzcf,t3_cup0on,1566644961.0,I used to not like having subtitles on if the movie/series I was watching was in a language I could understand. But I prefer them on now because it makes it easier to hear what is being said. Great for when I'm eating something too.
socialanxiety,exbxp0k,t3_crzomg,1566139783.0,"I think it might be because if you notice another person who is as quiet as you, it might be easier to put yourself in their shoes and understand in a way how to act around them. Tho I find that some people who are really extroverted I can actually talk with better than people who are just ""normal""."
aww,evslxzr,t1_evsl3o2,1564750438.0,"Not exactly, in Swedish the meaning is Thor- (like the Nordic god)- bear."
socialanxiety,esx8w5h,t3_c9bzt1,1562327119.0,"Exactly, I feel this way too. Like I can't be a ""new"" more grown person to people I've known all my life. It's as if I always have to stay the same in their eyes."
