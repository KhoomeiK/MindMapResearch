PharmacyTechnician,fksviez,t3_fkhwqf,1584499373.0,"It’s best to finish your counting before leaving. That is our pharmacist pet peeve, it just opens up for mistakes to happen. Counting errors happens, especially if it’s busy and you’re distracted. We have work flow at my work but when we are short or someone is on break or whatever you just have to know when to prioritize and what. Iv been a tech for 6 years and so i have mastered multi tasking. If I’m alone the pharmacist usually helps fill. (Fill a few, check them, fill a few ect) but if I have someone come up and their script is printed I’ll run and fill it and check them out then help who’s next. You can’t let the waiters just sit there. Just gotta learn to multi task comfortably, but it takes time. Always verify their address or phone number or birthday. Something to make sure you’re selling the right script correct person"

depression,ffvmrt4,t3_eva63z,1580267804.0,I started going. Not sure I had the right therapist for me but kept going... until I got a bill for almost $500 and stopped going. Stupid insurance. Not to be negative but it sucks insurance is so bad now a days. I can’t even get therapy because I can’t afford it.

depression,fbzqc3r,t1_far1yti,1577256254.0,Of course not. You have the right to ask anything about your medication. Unfortunately insurance companies are very known to swap between what they prefer and what they don’t throughout the year. If they are not giving you a straight answer you can always ask your dr. Iv heard both also.. so not sure which is true. I’d use extra protection until I found out for sure. But that’s just me and not wanting a baby

If she’s down cuddle her, love her. Let her know you’re there for her and you’re not going anywhere. I get anxiety about things with my boyfriend that we have talked about a million times, but my anxiety doesn’t care, and when I can think clearly I know I overreacted, or thought too much about whatever it is.

He started something over.. nothing and it turned into a thing. He told me to leave, so I tried but knowing I’m drunk I just sat in my car for a while trying to sober up and he text me asking me to come back and sleep it off. He’s passed out on the couch and I know when he wakes up he is going to feel like shit. He probably won’t even remember but will know it was bad because he’s on the couch.. Uhg. I just want us to be happy is always. I’m such a fuck up. I don’t purposely piss him off."

YouShouldKnow,f6o5erm,t1_f6lknc1,1573008139.0,"I work at a Walgreens. We have speed metrics also, or “verified by promised time”. It’s to make us keep up with when people are expecting their medication to be ready. I will say our system alerts the pharmacist of anyyyyy drug interaction, small or big. They have to manually override it and then put in their password to finish the override, Of course only if they feel it’s ok. We get so many “caps” on scripts it gets annoying lol. I will also say I would not go to a independent unless I checked the medication myself before taking it. There is one in my town that a tech worked at and she said it terrified her. The techs do basically everything, they have no system to make sure you’re filling the right drug or anything like that. It’s insane to think about when iv only worked at Walgreens and computers check literally everything we do. It’s so hard to make a mistake. Its bound to happen of course if you’re filling hundreds of scripts a day like we do, but not often."
