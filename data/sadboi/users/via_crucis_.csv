AskMen,fjz0gbo,t3_ffdh0g,1583708556.0,"I know how strange this is, but due to my faith, I won't have sex until marriage. And I did lead a very different life before and it's crazy how relationships are different; I used to have sex with girls I just met, and now I don't at all (obviously I only date girls who share my beliefs). But what is important to me is very different. I look for character and sharing interests. Sex doesn't even enter the equation. If I spend time talking to a girl, it's because I truly like her and enjoy her company.

I'm not suggesting full abstinence unless you hold specific beliefs, but withholding sex will definitely sort the men in your life if you hold yourself to a higher standard. Most men won't even be interested, but of those who are, I think your interactions will be so much more meaningful. So try establishing no sex early on with men and see who stays."
