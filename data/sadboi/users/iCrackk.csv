One thing I miss is meeting my small circle of people in person. But it's for everyone's safety. My school got over and we got country wide lockdown order from the night of my final exam. And now that my school's over my crush called me and confessed that she had a massive crush on me. I used to play a lot of games  in solo/random squads but now that everyone's free I've been able to play games with my irl friends and it feels great. It's the only way for me to connect with others during this time. Love to anyone who's feeling down at these times <3"
