Anxiety,fl9j55g,t1_fktjdnh,1584958101.0,I feel the same way to. It’s been 2 days now since I’m having panic attacks again. I’m experiencing nausea and dizziness. I want to go out because I don’t like staying at home it makes me more anxious but now I don’t have a choice but to stay at home because of the quarantine ☹️
