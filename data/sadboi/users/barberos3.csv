In Europe you cannot get prescribed Adderall, but you can get Ritalin, which is Methylphenidate, a cousin of amphetamines. I got tired of coke and had myself prescribed Ritalin.

You did everything right. Everything. I am proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself. The system is broken, and you are one of those who suffered from it, but don't ever question your contribution to society. You are a doctor, whatever the USA broken system of internships and applicatins had you believe, you have the potential to save lives. Now more than ever we need people like you.

You will be employed, paid and recognized as a doctor someday, there is no doubt. Please, don't give up on us.

The rest of my opinion, you don't need to read. I am from Europe and I know the USA education system is extremeley expensive and selective. A lot of people who could have more meaningful jobs or contribute more to the common good are left out by a corrupt system run by private corporations. Take this broken system, and mix it to the fact that you were an emigrate, and you've got the perfect cocktail for educational and profesionnal failure. It is not your responsibility, it is a systemic problem in the US. Maybe you were seduced by the ""American dream"", and I am very sorry you were fooled.

And when I wake up from a difficult episode that got me to the hospital somehow, I always take several days to reflect on what I have done before communicating with them again. Which they always interpret as me not valuing our friendship enough, or them being kind of responsible (because they weren't there when I needed it for example). 

The conflicts are more about me being ashamed of the torments my mental health has me through, and not being able to communicate about it clearly and in time, which has them excessively worried, rather than pulling everybody through my shit. If I may correct your interpretation."

Idk still doesn't seem like a nice guy. Kind of makes me wonder why they would be friends with him but whatever because he's out of the picture now.

Well Clark was carefree and at the beginning I was as well. When I was diagnosed I was a bit emotional. I told him ovarian cancer would prevent me from having sex for a while so benefits were off the table. That I'd be sick and lonely and I'd be happy he'd stick around even without the sex. That's when he felt I had trapped him in a relationship he didn't want to have. So I told him we should stop seeing each other altogether because it was never my intention to force him to do anything for me. I was sad, I thought we were friends. After that, and especially after I recovered and I started seeing all my friends again, I unintentionally told that story, the rumor spread, and the guys ostracized him to the point he eventually left the city. 

>Bruce sounds like a bit of an emotional wreck at this point. Let's be honest you weren't really considering dating him after his rude comment, you just wanted to let him down easy. Or am I mistaken? You see him as a friendly acquaintance but not a close friend.

Well, yes. At first, when he said all those things to me, I thought it was overwhelming but cute. I thought we could start over maybe, and we could have a more rational talk a bit later. But as you say, he didn't follow through and I felt I could never live up to whatever expectations he had built in his head over the years. It's a lot of pressure.

>Honestly I don't think you owe him any conversation. I think if Steven is interested in pursuing a relationship with you while preserving his friendship with Bruce then he should be the one to tell Bruce that he has feelings for you now. How is that your place to talk to Bruce on his behalf?

Steven said it was very sad I had never gotten the chance to read Bruce's letter and I should try to convince him one very last time to let me read it. To me it's like Steven has liked me as well for a while (in a less overwhelming way than Bruce tho), but he's prioritized his friend's feelings, maybe because he has known about them for years.

>You actually have no real romantic history with Bruce.

You're right and I like the way you phrase it. I think I'll talk to Steven before talking to Bruce. And if Steven doesn't want to follow through because he cares about his friend's feelings so much, I'll just close both cases and move on."

That's why I ghosted them for a while, I've felt that as a woman, I could never offer those guys anything worth it.

To be fair, I've never ""deeply cared"" about Bruce. I had a crush, he insulted me. I forgave him and for the sake of our group of friends, I stayed friends with him. When he confessed and I realized I misinterpreted, I thought ""let's start over"". He ran away from a possible relationship for so long I never even had a chance to (1) know he had such strong feelings and (2) develop strong feelings for him. He cut me off when I barely had a crush and in such an insulting way, sorry I moved on.

Clark, I wanted a real relationship, but he was the carefree kind of guy. When I was diagnosed with cancer, he thought I was trying to trap him into a relationship he was not ready to have. So I told him we should stop seeing each other altogether, because I didn't want him to feel forced to support me during the treatment. Cancer was my priority, must admit. I was very sad to have to let him go but he didn't really want to stay, even as a friend.

I want to go out with someone who makes me feel good, not someone who treats me like shit (Clark), or someone who's fantasized me so much he doesn't even know who I truly am anymore (Bruce). It starts with a date, I'd like to go on that date with Steven if he wants it too.

Do you think I shouldn't have given Bruce another chance ? I should have just told him ""well you insulted me and I've moved on, sorry"". I thought about it but the whole situation was so emotional, it seemed a little bit violent."

And yes, I must say I had my ups and downs since her passing 7 years ago. At some point it was so bad I had suicidal thoughts and had to be institutionalised. But it helped. I was reluctant at first since my mother was never cured with therapy, but time has passed and I eventually trusted the many therapists, psy nurses and psychiatrists I met along the way. I was able to open up, get the answers I desperately needed to heal and learned to take better care of myself. I take medication to stabilize my moods and see my therapist frequently. What I learned that helped me the most was when I realized that I suffered from a similar mood disorder as my mother, but had taken advantage of the experience of knowing her and was self aware not to make the same mistakes or spiral like she did. Some days it is hard being bipolar but I am more self aware, ""smarter"" and will never hesitate to reach out when I feel the need. Like tonight on Reddit. My worst nightmare would be to become like her and build resentment by keeping too much to myself. I feel lighter when I can get negative feelings off my chest, thanks to you guys and other resources.

You're right, we live in a time where more and more people open up their mental illnesses and feelings. It's empowering and benefiting everyone."

They were in love, she died. He's a widow. He doesn't hate her or trash talk, he's just taken the time to reflect on 20 years of emotional abuse and nowadays he expresses scepticism towards many things my mother told about herself. Imagine living with someone this sick - and I can attest how sick she was - for 20 long years and being abused to the point you're trapped and believe anything. Almost like Stockholm Syndrom.

Also I am soon meeting with one of my older  step brothers from her first marriage so we can talk about her younger years and gain perspective. But from the emails we have exchanged so far he sounds very much on my father's side."

SeriousConversation,ffuzljh,t1_ffuh8o3,1580252383.0,"No problem I appreciate honesty and I didn't mean to sound so firm either.

My process is to blame all the bad things she did and said on her mental illness which sadly took up a lot of space, if not all the space at differents times of my childhood. I try very hard to remember the few good times I had with her, the books we shared, she'd read a paragraph, I'd read the next and so on for hours. She also cared deeply about my education because deep down, even if she hated working, she wished she had a chance to complete a degree but got pregnant too early. Anytime I had a boyfriend as a teenager she'd be mean to him, and she'd tell me to be very cautious not to every let the relationship take over my academic ambitions. She didn't say it in a reassuring way of course... she would use very harsh words such as ""you're a whore and you're throwing your life opportunities down the trash by giving that idiot douchebag any attention and time, you should study"". My process of grief was always to make a difference between her true intentions hidden behind her words, her passions and good times the few times she expressed them, and put the rest in the box of her mental illness and not open it. I think it's healthy."
SeriousConversation,ffuymga,t1_fftej4f,1580251841.0,"As regretful as I am for hearing all those bad things about her, I still wish her to rest in peace yes. For her to be this extreme, she must have gone through a lot herself. Living in resentment, hate and shame like she did must have been extremely painful. I'm quite sure she frequently regretted her actions or words, but was too proud or ashamed to apologize, maybe a past trauma prevented her from presenting herself in a vulnerable state such as an apology. Anyways I hope she is feeling better now and liberated from everything she fled. And at the same time, I also feel more free since she passed and I don't have to go through the abuse anymore."
SeriousConversation,ffuy6gm,t1_ffu0ta8,1580251593.0,"Hey thanks. Actually before I was diagnosed bipolar type II, there were suspicions I might have C-PTSD from being abused by my mother. I dismissed it, although I have abandonment issues and am very susceptible, but it's not alarming enough to be considered C-PTSD.

As for my mother there is a possibility she suffered from C-PTSD, but as I mentionned in other comments, she clearly showed symptoms of bipolar type I and cyclothimia on a daily basis but also at the scale of her life. There's no doubt she fits the diagnosis. But as my therapist told me, diagnosis aren't boxes, they are scales. You can show symptoms of different mental illnesses at different degrees. I think my mother might have been suffering from PTSD or C-PTSD to some extent, which would explain the lying and need to hide in her room a lot. She also showed symptoms of borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. All those are caused by trauma and are scales on which I can place my mother, in my opinion."

SeriousConversation,ffuv3zc,t1_ffu0vkn,1580249913.0,"Hum I see your point although I'm not sure if you're talking about my grandmother or mother or both in different paragraphs. I was told by several therapists and psychiatrist I went to (because I was depressed and in grief and wanted to understand my mother) that she was bipolar type I, the type that experience extreme lows and highs and often cyclothimia. Her life story showed succession of very bad depressive episodes (with suicide attempts) and out-of-control manic episodes, like that one time she sold the family house and didn't tell my father so we had to empty the house in 48 hours and moved out to a shithole kilometers away. We had paid more than half the loan only 5 years to go it was the worst real estate deal of all time. My father is still infuriated about that. We had to change school, my father's commute to work tripled. She was euphoric for two months, while we were doing some repairs around the new house, then she sank in depression again and locked herself in her bedroom all day and all night. She did the same with the two family cars. She did the same with our schools. If a teacher said something bad about one of her child, she'd show up at the teachers meeting and literally yelled her heart out, cried, threaten to have him fired, leaving the teacher speechless. Then she would change the kid schools, me or my brothers, because she was so ashamed that someone would question one of her childrens ability (all the while being verbally abusive at home with us remember ?). 

She clearly was bipolar but I agree she showed traits of Borderline PD. Yelling in public, seeking attention, being overly aggressive and defensive to the point of threatening a close one with a kitchen knife, not being able to process intense emotions and exploding, self destructive or self sabotaging oneself are more traits of BPD than bipolar. Maybe she was a little bit (or a lot) of both. 

EDIT : from this point I completely lost track of what you said in your comment, so I'm going to react here, and feel free to read the rest as well. The rest revolves around my mother and grandmothers relationship. So : like I mentioned in another comment, I totally agree people don't behave like this for no reason. Bipolar disorder is partly genetic ans is triggered by the environment that is, a trauma. I am quite sure she experienced trauma. But everything is so vague and full of lies, I cannot put my finger on the exact traumatizing event she went through. I can barely guess. There might be some truth about her relationship to her father, maybe it wasn't always healthy. Did it come to rape ? I will never know for sure. Was she abused by someone else ? And if none of those are true, what other trauma could she have gone through ? Clearly, she was already ill at 18, so it must have been in her childhood or teenagehood. I am not dismissing any trauma she might have gone through, and neither is my father, who mentions all the things she said and did with skepticism but without saying they're false either. We are just in doubt about what might have triggered her BD ou BPD. All we have are the symptoms she showed afterwards and that we all suffered from...

As for my grandmother I think she was a genuine good person at the time I met her, but she was already an old lady so I wouldn't presume she was always like that. She raised an only child while working full time (in the 50s-60s it was not expected and frequent for women so heads up!) and at the time my mother claimed her mother was absent and would be mean and not caring the few times she was around. Mom said she was raised by her grandparents mostly. I'm not sure it's true because I have seen loads of pictures of my mother on holidays with her parents, as both my grandparents were working for the biggest telecommunication company in the country they made a lot of money and a lot of their trips abroad were paid for by the company. As a teenager my mother was given the keys to their vacation house in the mountains and would bring her girlfriends there. Maybe there has been abuse or her parents weren't loving and caring enough for her as an only child she needed a lot of attention, I am doubting it but other than that she was spoiled. I think my grandmother who was submissive with her husband, let them both fight and secretly suffered from seeing her daughter leave at such a young age and making bad decisions after bad decisions. She tried, she'd help my mother's first four children financially in secret. But my mother kept rejecting her parents, claiming they were abusive. And when she was out of cash, she resorted to blackmail. My grandmother must have suffered so much of a conflict she may not even have been involved in but was associated to... She saw her daughter leave angry, never to return, blackmailing for money, sometimes stealing it like that time where she intruded their vacation home and sold half the furniture... I think all my grandmother ever wanted was for her daughter to be sane and happy so she could reconcile with her and enjoy being a mother again. That's why my grandma was very very protective of my four stepbrothers. As for me and my brothers she tried twice but my mother fled the country and took us with her so we could never have a real relationship with my grandparents. We were told they rejected us but it was the other way around, as my grandma and stepbrothera told me at the funeral.

I've lost my train of thought sorry. But you're absolutely 200% right when you say getting psychological at the time was not the same as today. It was expensive, it was kind of frowned upon or at least caused prejudice to the person who openly seeked professional help. And of course, we didn't have Reddit or social media to express our pain. She must have kept so much to herself, which led to resentment and later in her life, to get it out on everybody around her who paid the slightest attention. She got help eventually, when I was 11. My mother was going through one of her darkest episodes and my father was always on business trips. They had changed me school and I was bullied in the new one. I was very very sad. One day I had locked myself in the school bathroom and they would throw rocks at me over the door, I cried and cut myself the insults they were saying. I was soon on therapy and didn't have much to say, I was changed  school again.  But that opened the door  to therapy for my mother and she started going. But she didn't tell the truth and lied to the therapists. She never talked about old stuff, she would tell them she was stuck in an abusive marriage to justify the extreme lows and highs she experienced. 

When she died we talked with her therapist and were shocked at how my mother depicted our family. Either my mother was a pathological liar, or it was way too late for her to solve her issues. She had already lost track of what traumatized her in the first place... It's highly possible.

Anyways thank you for your answer and suggestions and sorry about the rant, I'm on mobile and didn't realize I was writing this much.

My process is to blame the bad things on her illness, which was not her fault and she suffered from, and cherish the few good memories.

My mother never made that step, she considered her exaggerated emotional outbreaks as normal and never, ever apologized.

SeriousConversation,fftkedt,t1_fftf39y,1580222838.0,"My father has been in love with my mother all his life, not even realizing if was being abused / manipulated. It's been seven years now that she passed away, and five years that he is in a healthy, loving relationship. I sincerely think it's finally made him aware of what he went through with my mother and was able to reflect on all the things she had said and done. My father is definitely not a liar. Best and worst, he wants us to know the truth and not embellish or romanticize our relationship with her. It all started when me and my brothers started bringing up bad memories of her, he would correct us on her real intentions, little by little, step by step. Eventually, I had several serious talks about her with him because it raised so many questions.

EDIT : For example. I had vaguely heard about the sexual abuse my mother suffered as a teenager from her father. When Ibwas 11-12 she showed me a pic of her at a beauty pageant when she was 17 and whispered ""that's when it all started, he couldn't stop himself afterwards, that's why I left home a year later. It's hard being touched and forced by your own father... * sigh and moving on to another picture * "". No details, no tears, almost no emotion, just an evasive comment. Also for context, she accused several people of rape and sexual abuse including her first two husbands and my own father and strangers. At some point she was attending some kind of book club with my dad, but that one time my father was on a business trip and she went alone. Apparently she was harassed and touched without her consent by one of the members before she managed to get in her car and escape. It's way too many coincidences and what bugs me is that none of the situations she pretended were sexual assaults were dangerous or risky. It just always happened to her out of fucking nowhere, without her seeing it coming.

I'm not saying she has never been sexually harassed or assaulted. Unfortunately A LOT of women are at some point in their lives. I have been drugged without my consent a month ago and managed to escape, but I was in a club at 7 in the morning so that's the kind of things that happens in those places. I'm just saying maybe it happened once and it traumatized her so much that she kept on telling the same story every now and again to get empathy and consolation from her close ones as if she had never grieved the first assault. 

I would never say that she hasn't been through anything traumatic, she sure did otherwise she wouldn't have been so mentally ill. Bipolar disorder is partly genetic partly environmental and is generally triggered in young adults by a traumatic event. She must have been traumatized by SOMETHING. But it doesn't excuse an entire life of abuse and blackmail to everyone around her."

bipolar,ffn3i0x,t3_eu62c5,1580061641.0,"In my country I was told bipolar should never be diagnosed in people under 30 because the episodes aren't significant enough under a certain frequency and other criteria. But during a major depressive episode I had when I was 20 that got me in a psych ward, I was told by my psychiatrist she considered that diagnosis because my mother was bipolar, and bipolar was at least, partly genetic. She explained that I checked out a lot of boxes : genetics, environmental, symptoms. She treated me as a classic depressive episode nonetheless but her diagnosis stuck with me.

Years later when I fell into another depressive episode, I mentioned this to my current psychiatrist. And although neither him nor me want to treat / be treated for bipolar, we must say looking at things from that angle has improved my quality of life. The bipolar drugs work better than antidepressants, and knowing that I am going through mood changes makes me able to anticipate them better. The diagnosis has never been confirmed but me and my psychiatrist use it as a basis for my therapy and treatment and it works."
bipolar,fej1y3q,t3_epdzgx,1579153937.0,"I have lived something very, very similar but I'm not sure I have any advice to give you except maybe telling my story and how it ended and giving you more details on how bipolar works.

My mother was bipolar, and just like your father, she would go through episodes of depression that lasted for years, interrupted by short weeks or months of mania where she'd make weird and abrupt decisions. While I was growing up, I mostly remember her as depressed, but when I was 11, she went full manic and sold the house without telling my father. We moved, but after a few months she fell back into depression again. Ponctually, throughout her depressive and manic episodes, she'd tell us (me and my brothers) that she never wanted us and we were a disgrace. It felt like harassment so at the first opportunity I had I moved out at 16. My brothers moved out as well the same year. Being practically on her own (with only my little brother left to torture), she went full manic again, argued she wanted to go back to work and was able to keep a job. We let her. It lasted months. During those episodes, she had strongly mixed feelings about us, we were sometimes welcome at home, sometimes not. Eventually we all came home in the summer, it was time to share what we had all been up to since we moved out. We talked about our progresses and failures. She was immensely disappointed in us for various ridiculous reasons. She went on panic mode (we still don't know which child, which criteria, which specific ""event"" or ""failure"" made her feel that way), she competely shut down. Didn't talk. Would scream if you adressed her. If you insisted she'd threaten you with a knife. It lasted two weeks, and we were hoping at some point, she'd calmed down. It looked like it, because one afternoon she came to us and said ""well, I'm taking the week end off with my grandchildren (from my stepbrother), I'll feel better when I come back"". She committed suicide on the way there and never came home.

What I'm saying is : since you can never predict or guess what episode a bipolar person is going through (depression, mania, rapid cycling, anxiety), you can only let them be and do your best, even if it takes up a lot of your energy, to stay close to them and keep the communication going. They might need your help out of nowhere. They may not be able to express it. They might put harsh words on horrible feelings they have but that are not adressed to you personnally (even if they seem so). It takes patience and understanding, and I know it's exhausting. I have been there and my own bipolar is way more under control than my mom's but I am still difficult to communicate with at times. 

I think you are doing the right thing reaching out to your dad's. If you are very worried, you might take the step further and visit him. But don't let his words make you question his love for you. Give him time and space but stay right by his side, just in case. 

I really don't know if it helped, but I tried."

Nobody was bleeding, hyperventilating, having some kind of attack, except for me, struggling to stay awake and breathing very heavily. Even the people around me were wondering why I was left that way.

I remember when telling the story to the nurse, I couln't make myself clear and I was so ashamed to have followed that guy that I didnt give her any details just ""I went clubbing, I met someone friendly who offered coke which I do quite often, but what he gave me wasn't coke and I'm barely standing on my feet, he could have raped me"". I assume she thought since there was no rape and I was just another junkie, I didn't need help as fast as the others, or no help at all. Which is highly unprofessionnal. If the setting of the ER would have been more private, I could have told her the guy had tricked me to stay by giving me something else and that should have triggered some kind of alarm. But I couldn't, I had obvious difficulties making sense of what had happened, I just insisted on the fact a rape drug was involved. And she didn't care.

Anyways, she was just the person at the front desk, not the person I should have been telling the whole story to. I thought she would realize something traumatizing had happened and at least put me in a private room where I could have rested a little while until a doctor would have had time to see me.

relationship_advice,f9s741o,t1_f9s6uly,1575586965.0,"Yeah that was my thought... Moving on then :-) 

Hopefully I didn't put too much hopes in it, I just wish I'd understand but I'm fine with it."
SuicideWatch,f7h9joz,t3_dvze41,1573735821.0,"I'm so sorry that you are suicidal and am even more sorry that you have to live with the guilt.

The US healthcare system is fucked up."
SeriousConversation,f6ybq47,t1_f6y96c2,1573273889.0,"In Europe it is so much harder to be prescribed opiods ! You better have a damn good reason and generally, they only give it to you at the hospital, and let you go with no prescription when you're feeling better. Like... it's almost impossible to get opiods in a pharmacy here in Europe, no scripts, very rare substance, etc.

Adderall is the same. We only have Ritalin (methylphenidate) and not amphetamines (Adderall). And they only prescribe it to people under 18 who have severe ADHD. It is very, very rare. I once hoped I'd be prescribed Ritalin since I loved stimulants and told my psych cocaine made me feel better about my depression (more focus, more work down, better mood, etc.), but I was told it was only prescribed under very particular conditions and I didn't fit the criterias.

But I can totally understand how both substances build up a tolerance and are not worth the ""high"" and ""comedown"" if you were in a position where you'd legitimately had to take them."
SeriousConversation,f6yat7v,t1_f6xq7t2,1573273035.0,Good luck !! and good for you that you already quit kratom :-) Amazing
SeriousConversation,f6xpwsy,t1_f6xos7z,1573255272.0,"I've watched the video and I sincerely wished it was that simple to ""change habits"". But addiction is not the same thing as a ""bad habit"", it comes with physical and psychological pain and withdrawal symptoms when you try to quit.

I'm thinking of joing the NA in my city though... Not too sure, but thinking about it."
SeriousConversation,f6xoffa,t1_f6xknfe,1573254156.0,"You are right... There are so many of us out there, some who are self aware, some who are not, some who are fighting, some who don't care and let go... I think it's a huge step to be able to tell yourself ""I am a fucking addict and this thing I'm doing is wrong and hurts my body"".

Oh I didn't have that much details about the cold medicine, but now I know. I have never tried it, like I said, it's not a thing where I live (I don't even think they use those molecules in the cold medicine we can buy over the counter here). But I heard a lot of people doing it in the US.

And yes, we are killing ourselves... this makes me very sad when I think about it because I have a pretty healthy lifestyle : a healthy and light diet, I bicycle to work everyday, I take dance classes and have a zero waste hippie lifestyle (only buy organic vegetables and don't eat meat often and only use self-made cosmetic products). But every fucking day of my fucking life, I come back from work, I put an ashtray and a bottle of wine on my kitchen table, take my coke out of my purse, and start my toxic ritual... I am ashamed of this habit, it's been going on for a year and a half.

EDIT : and before that, it was worse, because I had roommates so I had to hide all the empty bottles. otherwise I'd have been so ashamed!! And before that I lived with my brother and he didn't tolerate the smell of weed or any drug for that matter. When I took my prescribed benzos every night, he'd always have this ironic smirk like ""you don't need that""."
SeriousConversation,f6xnj0q,t1_f6xlbcx,1573253494.0,"""functioning beofre but much happier now"" really speaks to me... I am not a happy person, even though I have everything I ever wanted. Maybe sobriety could get me to the place your step dad is in. Even more successful and happier with the little things and hobbies.

I really have to discipline myself (one addiction at a time), thanks for sharing your stories."
SeriousConversation,f6xkrht,t1_f6xke4z,1573251586.0,"Yeah that's the thing. I've never really hit ""rock bottom"". Throughout the many years of my multiple addictions, I have always been spectacularly functioning. Got my Master's degree with honors high on benzodiazepines and alcoholic... My job got me on cocaine quickly because the schedules and pressure are hard, so I like to be stimulated. But everything is going... well ? So, why stop ? 

I KNOW addictions are bad, cocaine is bad, cigarettes are bad, alcohol is bad, I know all this, I don't need to be reminded. But I have my life under control and it's hard to tell myself ""now you're going through detox"". Nobody around me would understand. They don't have a clue."
SeriousConversation,f6xjr1m,t1_f6xj2a6,1573250982.0,"Oh yeah I've heard cold medicine is a thing in the US and other places in the world. It's really not where I live but I believe you (it's the codeine I guess ?). 

Good you managed to quit alcohol, it's definitely the worst. And I totally agree with you : when you start or quit a new substance, it alters your dosages of other substances. I used to love benzos and did so much of them (up to 12mg of xanax a day), but then I discovered cocaine and I went down to 5mg of xanax a day... cause I could snort and feel energetic and happy instead of just high, quite tired and a little euphoric.

I think when you're an addict, it's in your genes, and whatever the substance, you will get hooked. So it's normal quitting one thing influences the others."
SeriousConversation,f6xj5ej,t1_f6xiln3,1573250631.0,"wow good for you, you quit everything ! 

I'm so glad you got your life back and under control. How were you treated ? I'm thinking of being treated but I don't know where to start or how they will manage it."

It feels weird that the years fly by and nothing improves. As you said, it's like you ""borrow"" time."

You express bipolar feelings very well in your art and it's important to me to sometimes put images or drawings instead of words. Sometimes words aren't enough, and a picture says it all.
You're good, keep it up ! :-)"
