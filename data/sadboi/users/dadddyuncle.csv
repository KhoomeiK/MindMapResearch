But i caught myself, i ran back up the driveway and into my house, i locked my back door then when i went to lock my front door it wouldn‚Äôt lock i saw him on the porch through the window (our window is the size of a large door ) and he tried to turn it,  held it for a minute and told my mom to hold it while i got some tape to secure the door it worked for a while and we were planning on going down the the basement to hide , then the dream ended , i dont know what would have happened next
, whats strange is that a few days later i had another dream , i cant remember alot of it , but I remember seeing someone strange at school (other stuff happened that i cant remember) and then later i went to a gas station and someone else whos face I couldn‚Äôt see tried to kill me again, i hugged him for some reason and reached into his gun holder and pulled out a knife , and it ended there."
