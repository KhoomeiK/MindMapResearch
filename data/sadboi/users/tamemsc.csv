ambien,fqn1mbh,t1_fqn0yz8,1589487145.0,"yeah pretty much, it wasn‚Äôt a quick jump though it‚Äôs been 6 months since i last did xans so that could be why i don‚Äôt have have any tolerance to zopiclone now. i feel like if you‚Äôre still using xans frequently or have only just recently quit you‚Äôll most likely have a tolerance to ambien as its the same kinda thing but don‚Äôt take my word for it"
ambien,fqmuk9v,t3_gjpan4,1589483769.0,"i abused xans heavily on and off from january to november last year, a couple days ago i was prescribed 7.5mg zopiclone for insomnia and they work perfectly for me

BPD,fqhayro,t3_giltnk,1589372898.0,thank you so much for this post. i have bpd myself and it irks me when i see other people using bpd as an excuse to not take responsibility for abusive behaviour. of course bpd is usually the cause of the behaviour - i used to be an extremely toxic person in the past due to my bpd so i‚Äôm very familiar - but that doesn‚Äôt mean people shouldn‚Äôt be held accountable for their actions. it isn‚Äôt fair.

BPD,fqh7vru,t1_fqh5ruz,1589370518.0,thank you! i was mainly concerned about it possibly making my bpd even worse than it already is cos that would be hell for me. but if it doesn‚Äôt then that‚Äôs perfect
ambien,fqgtafc,t3_ghi8j5,1589356409.0,took 7.5mg zopiclone last night and after around an hour things started to move a little bit. it looked pretty similar to the very first affects of lsd imo
