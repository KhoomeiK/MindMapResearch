If a story looks likes it has been abandoned, the original owner still owns the copyright to that story. They can claim that story at any time if they decide to return to their content and find that it has been ripped off by people. So, I would strongly advise against using stories that have been seemingly abandoned by the original content creator on any website."

I can see how that would upset authors when that is not the intended genre of their story because not every story fits the creepypasta bill. However, I didn't know people were mislabeling these stories for views though. So I agree, we gotta take care of this. It could be a simple misunderstanding or malicious mislabeling. Either way, if we put the information out there, people will have no excuse. Especially, if they are apart of this community."

YTNarratorsGuild,fcfyoau,t3_edf331,1577634907.0,"I agree, that's a really good idea about a creating a joint narrator/writer registry. The writers could have control over what stories they can give permissions/explicitly state their terms and conditions of how their story is to be used when a channel gets monetized (or even if it doesn’t). Narrators who join the registry would agree to the writers terms. Also, we could develop a standard story price exchange system that authors and writers can both agree on such as X price for this many subs on the channel, X price for how many words a story is, ect. Obviously, this would be a voluntary agreement thus would still allow all authors to set their own prices for their works if they decide to opt out of the agreement."

aliens,f7cehlg,t1_f7cdq2q,1573590504.0,That's a really good point but I think they would be more advanced scientifically if they could travel with light speed.

No I don't know everything that there is to science but I still like continuing to learn. What do you think would happen if you went to a different being's world?

depression,f5ywyj7,t1_f5yo85a,1572562879.0,"I'm not a policy expert, but Canada, France, Japan, England, Australia, and many other industrialized countries have a form of the universal health care system. They seem to be doing just fine and just because something is expensive doesn't make it better quality."
depression,f5y03gt,t1_f5xxyc5,1572548835.0,I can see your point too.
depression,f5xzz6j,t1_f5xzmsz,1572548783.0,Cyberpunk? How so? Like the matrix?
depression,f5xzg23,t1_f5xy826,1572548549.0,"There are no big techno-fixes for the climate sinks and natural environmental ecosystem factors that are disappearing or being destroyed. Yes, China is now the biggest user of coal in the world (next to us) but they are still industrializing much of there country. Money makes the world go round.  The United States is still living overabundantly and is the biggest consumer of energy being produced. I feel like we have to solve these problems as a united globe vs. individual nations. Idk, that's just how I feel."
depression,f5xyd76,t1_f5xxkyi,1572548085.0,"True, everything has a natural cycle, but I feel like we are really fucking up on a massive scale. All the IPCC reports aren't taking into account the pollution and environmental degradation the military has caused. Especially the navy, I was in for six years and I am now in college seeing the science behind my 2017 deployment. It's very discouraging and the media isn't helping things much either."

depression,f5xw3cq,t3_dppj2g,1572547107.0,All health care of all types should be free and it should not be a barrier to a happier life.
depression,f5xufo6,t3_dpl4bu,1572546408.0,"Everything is a lie, people don't want to actually see you for who you are when you truthfully answer the question ""How is your day going?"", It's all awkward bullshit. Every interaction is plainly superficial and there are no real human connects past what are you doing this weekend? (small talk) or if you do think they are your friends wait until life gets hard for you. Then you will find out who actually gives a shit about your well-being. People use you in the here and now to fulfill their needs but they don't actually care about your needs. Then you think about dying because what is the point anyways but the fear of upsetting others outweighs that so-called ""selfish"" desire. It makes you feel like a hollow shell of a person. 

I'm sorry you are suffering. You are not alone."
theunexplained,f5s3sam,t1_f5s29ek,1572410817.0,"Thanks I appreciate that. The footage shows feed from the cameras inside the jet that shows them tracking an unidentified object. I think that footage over a lot of other things is more believable. 

Buzzfeed Unsolved episode that has the footage of the F/A-18 Super Hornet in it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aLfKYD\_bGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aLfKYD_bGw)"
mealtimevideos,f5rt68v,t1_f5ltlno,1572402394.0,I wasn't trying to mislead you. I enjoy stories like this and I know other people do. I apologize. I will make sure my titles are more descriptive from now on.
theunexplained,f5rsyjm,t1_f5on8up,1572402247.0,"I agree with you! All of these stories are so fascinating and I can't help but listen to every horror story narrarator out there that posts cryptid/paranormal stories. Spanish explorers said that there were half-jungle cat/half- sea creature? Wow that is bazaar. Is this from the Christopher Columbus ""discovering America"" era or before that? 

I do think there are things in the ocean that we don't fully understand. We have yet to be able to chart all areas of the ocean/seas because of the pressure....What do you think of the official Navy footage from F-15 jets? Buzzfeed Unsolved did a segment about it."
GetMoreViewsYT,f5rsg0k,t1_f4gnzkx,1572401877.0,I'm glad you liked the stories! They were chilling to read. I love camping but I never want to see any type of cryptid....I would probably die lol
