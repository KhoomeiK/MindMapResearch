When I was 15, I tripped down some stairs and sprained it again. It swelled up super bad (a lot worse than my other sprains), so we went for an x-ray. We found out that at some point, I had actually broken my ankle. The doctor said it had probably been a decade or so, because the piece of my ankle that fractured off was so worn down it was totally smooth. So, in short, a chunk of my ankle broke off my ankle, never healed, and my body eroded that bone and i‚Äôm fine now, 20-something years later, but that ankle still ‚Äúclicks‚Äù a lot. Lol"
