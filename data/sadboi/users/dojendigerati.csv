hamsters,flln1en,t1_fllmpjt,1585263692.0,They tried to give to Petco and petsmart but due to coronavirus they wont take.  I also checked the local shelters and same thing. I have some messages in to hamster and small animal rescues. I dont want them to be snake food and that is why I am trying to find a solution that saves them. I am hoping a rescue can point me in the right direction. I plan on donating to any rescue who can take them as well.

addiction,f0ge0u4,t3_d4to8g,1568598069.0,Depending on the dose the effects can be similar. They are both strong opiates.  Yes you can be a functioning heroin addict for sure.  You can go back and forth with taking one or the other. The withdrawal from either is just an opiate habit.  They two are pretty interchangeable except for strength. He is addicted to opiates. Any opiate can of enough strength will keep him from withdrawals.  He can very well be doing heroin and is able to be functional.

JNUG is for days you feel gold is going up.  DUST AND JDST are the inverse of JNUG (Buy when gold is tanking).  They are either 3x leveraged which make gains 3x larger or losses 3x worse (TVIX 2x).  It's basically the gambling stocks for me. Dont hold them more than a few days.

If you need to pick and hold then I would feel comfortable with United Healthcare. They dropped a bit recently, but they are profitable and consistent."

suboxone,eqadtxt,t3_bvgr11,1559930986.0,Life long depression and anxiety for me.  Some of the most depression free moments of my life were when I was on suboxone. That was almost 20 years ago. Since then I have went through hell detoxing off them 15 years or so ago.  Depression for last 15 years has been bad. Ended up in psych hospital last year and have been doing ect for 7 months. Considering taking a look at suboxone again as a possible depression and anxiety drug. I mainly think I have an endorphin deficiency influencing my depression and suboxone may help me. I dont know for sure but am researching others feedback.
