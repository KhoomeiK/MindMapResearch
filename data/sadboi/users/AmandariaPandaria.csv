Absurdism,fnt1s6x,t1_fnsy0ax,1587232968.0," Fredman, is quitting school and being homeless really what you ""please to do"" or choose to do? Or is it just the only ""viable"" alternative to living (without dying) compared your previously miserable life? Are you still miserable with these ""changes""? Absurdism preached to live inspite of the  pointless existence we have presented to us, how do your changes reflect that?

Im not questioning your choices, just curious how you weighed the options and the results in contrast to your initial comment. Ive considered this option, but I have high doubts I would be less miserable in that alternative compared to the predetermined life pattern set before me. 

Im fascinated by this type of discussion, its what helps me tease apart my reaction to absurdism and hopefully combat my nihilistic nature. I hope you arent offended or overwhelmed by my comments."

 Ive also struggled with MDD for the last 4 years. Ive been on and off disability for work constantly. Unfortunately I do care about the consequences of security because I have 3 dogs and my husband, who are the only reasons I continue to fight that urge to just give up. 

Youve talked of changed to cope with the way live is. But it sounds like you didnt make changes, you just gave up. Which I dont blame you. Your above statements seem to contradict your comment about changing life up and out of the monotony quoting its ""bad faith"". Im confused on your stance, your point, and the way you see things, to be honest. 

My question was, what changes to life's monotonous pattern do you suggest that are ""what you want to do, not must do"" ,and if your response is that you just give up and let go of everything, then that isnt anymore helpful than people in search of the inaccessible happiness, no?"
Absurdism,fnsllaq,t1_fnsdiqo,1587224120.0,"How do you suggest changing it up?

 For me, the monotonous pattern of everyday life is the predetermined human existence of going to school, get a job, work for 30+ years, retire, die. I feel like there isnt much wiggle room in the way society has developed to change this without risking safety and security (which if you dont have money to eat or shelter yourself, it may not be great for well being).

Sure, you could change up by having cheerios instead of oatmeal. And sure there are plenty people who are content even in poverty. But i find its hard to give up safety for a chance at improved happiness. Does that make sense? Idk lol"

ADHD,fne3oke,t3_g17zbn,1586882496.0,"When i was talking to a new psychiatrist last week (was just diagnosed a few days ago).

Basically everything I said, both him and my husband would say ""yeah, so that's not what a 'normal' person would think""

I get triggered and fixate on little things, such as my neighbors putting out 10 bags of trash. It destroys me. Day to day living is just overwhelming for me in general. The idea of having to think of what to have for dinner and then cook it sends me into a tail spin. Cleaning? I get anxious because its not done, but never able to start.

Projects are overwhelming. I dont start anything because I cant figure out where to start, where is the best part to start? My husband tells me ""just start with anything, it wont matter"", my brain tells me otherwise.

I tend to blurt things out. Especially at night. My husband will just be falling asleep and i will blurt out one of the hundreds of things going through my head, such as ""why do women wear skirts and men pants?"" Then i will proceed not to sleep because of these thoughts gnawing at me.

My thoughts in general are impulsive and constantly racing. If I can get someone to listen to me for more than a minute, i will likely have talked about 10 different things. Completely unrelated. My mind just jumps around.

I tune out when others talk to me, not because i dont care what they have to say, but because i get distracted by my own thoughts or other things happening around me. It really pisses people off when they realize ""im not listening"" but i cant help it. 

Sorry for the long post. There is so much going through my head, again when i have an opportunity its hard to shut up. 

TLDR: i wish i was neurotypical, it would make life a lot easier.  Everything i think is atypical and causes issues for myself and others."

Whatever medication you are on, get a second opinion. Talk to your pharmacist. Be open to your doctor and psychiatrist about what's happening. I cant stress getting second opinions enough. No one doctor knows everything, and may not ask certain questions another might. They are human."

ADHD,fn7hfax,t3_fzlsqf,1586720388.0,"Yup. 

Sometimes i just get my dogs all riled up and we will just stand in the hall making loud noises/barking until my husband yells at us to shut up. 

I also have a thing where I have this urge to screech/squeal while doing an excessive full body weid contortional stretch thing (i dont know how to describe it) when i am trying to fall asleep or when i wake up. Sometimes i just do the screech on its own because it feels good, like it releases some tension or some shit. It pisses my husband right off as it gives him an instant headache. 

I just got diagnosed with ADHD, so im hoping with my new meds it will stop the urge.

Ironically, i cant stand when others make noise constantly. It really agitates me. Like listening to someone on the phone, or someone else's tv, or really anything makes me fly off the handle. A bit hypocritical, but cant help it."
ADHD,fn76alg,t3_fzy1y0,1586714124.0,"Im so sorry to hear you are struggling. And i know it wont fix anything, but know there are others who feel the same way. The ""general inability to be an adult"" really struck a cord with me.

I was lucky to succeed in uni and become a RN. I love my job but in the last 3 years my 27 yo body felt like it was 80. I slowly and painfully advocated for help from my GP. Finally was diagnosed with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, along with severe depression and anxiety. Despite being off work for 6 months on disability for depression, a banquet of different meds, therapy, and all the other bullshit, i still couldnt function normally. Just the other day I had a phone appointment with a new psychiatrist. He believed i was wrongly diagnosed, that it was ADHD and it was also causing depression. So basically my doctor was treating a symptom not the cause, hense the failure. I LITERALLY just started concerta 18mg today, i dont feel better but more importantly, i dont feel worse. 

That was a kind of condensed version of my story lol and Id be happy to talk more if you need to, especially on the feelings of guilt (this is huge for me) but my point is- go see this new psychiatrist and advocate for yourself or bring someone who loves you and has seen you struggle. (My husband has been my advocate, especially on days i couldn't leave my bed, or when i wanted to kill myself and  felt nobody was listening). Dont stop until you feel yourself again. Go through 3 psychiatrists, 2 psychologists, 2 GPs, multiple specialists until you get answers. You dont deserve to feel this way. 

Dont stop. Just keep pushing. Eventually someone who can help will hear you saying ""I DON'T FEEL RIGHT. SOMETHING IS WRONG"". Hopefully it wont take 3 years for you like it did me.

I dont know if this was helpful or whatever but just wanted to share as your post resonates with me.

You deserve to be happy and successful in this monotonous bologna world."
