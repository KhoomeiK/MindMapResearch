Just because there wasn't a diagnosis for it throughout history doesn't mean it didn't exist. Mental illness did not begin when the diagnosis' were created.

The pressure from multiple patients at once wanting stuff right away that you can't hurry because u have to wait on busy doctors and u get all the anger and abuse from patients. Not to mention entitled patients and families. Constant imposter syndrome always having to prove your competetence. One mistake? Get made to feel like dog crap. the bullying culture is rife in the female dominant profession. Don't get support from management. Constantly having to perform to a high level, pretending to be normal all the Time, the constant socialization and having to advocate for patients while also navigating the heierachy and politics of nursing. It's not about the patient care most of the time it's all fucked up. I have worked in a few areas and so far I fucking hate it. Sorry if this is not what you want to hear.

BPD,fi01mio,t1_fhy2dda,1582022253.0,"Rude. Reducing the stigma is informing people especially professionals of the reasons behind the ""negative behaviours"" as understanding and validation is what facilitates recovery. I'm not denying that recovery is optimal and there are negative aspects to this disorder, however I think reducing the stigma means instead of thinking attention seeking people think these people are in pain and crying for help. Instead of thinking manipulative, this person is deadly afraid of being left alone, not condoning the actions, but understanding. There are negative aspects to depression but it doesn't have this stigma. We are not bad people and we don't deserve to feel like the scum of the earth for something we didn't ask for."
