I really relate with the last two sentences here. Wow."
NarcissisticAbuse,fr2hxg9,t1_fr2hgj9,1589837587.0,I’m sorry you had to go through that on top of your father’s passing. How ridiculous!
Stalking,fr2f3hn,t1_fqcgbe4,1589836181.0,"Thank you. I am not dealing with this right now, I was just confused on how it was related if no sexual violence or harassment was involved. Thank you so much for your personal help if I were going through this. I truly appreciate that. Maybe someone will read your post and feel comfortable to reach out."
NoStupidQuestions,fpatpni,t1_fdmf3zu,1588455506.0,Is there a way someone can hack past my privacy settings on social media without my knowing at all? Without gaining access through my email/password? Without having accepted any requests or taken any quizzes? More like they can see it as public without being *in* the account.
Stalking,fparvcx,t1_fp8hy2u,1588454414.0,Yes. My ex would pretend to be friends of mine by using their names with one letter off or replaced to pose as them to get me baited. Keep. Track. Of. Everything.

AskAstrologers,fp0jhg1,t1_fp0cxnt,1588210502.0,You’re welcome! I HIGHLY doubt it’s any different. The humanmetrics one has been used in the past in schools for career typing.
AskAstrologers,fp0crcx,t1_fp0avcq,1588206763.0,You don’t have to pay for it. You can go to humanmetrics.con for the longer version or 16personalities.con for a condensed version.
Stalking,fp0c28h,t1_fp096jr,1588206389.0,Especially if contacting the police means leaving a paper trail.
Stalking,fp0c0b5,t1_fp096jr,1588206359.0,"In my state, it is deemed harassment when someone contacts you even once after telling them not to. You may find a cease and desist letter be better anyhow, because you’re right, some police don’t do anything. Either way is worth a shot."
Stalking,fp08uj9,t3_fvopxu,1588204654.0,"I am interested in knowing these belief systems but I understand that puts your in jeopardy to state. I figured there was an institution continuing these things I just haven’t figured out how or where. It makes total sense they would do it through cults and religious institutions.

Edit: you*"
Stalking,fp08jvm,t3_fvvlv5,1588204493.0,"If you have screenshots of telling her to leave you alone and she sent you a physical letter and also reached out to your brother, I would take it to the police to get a TPO and then if need be a life time restraining order."
Stalking,fp081xe,t3_g0wucv,1588204221.0,Has any of this been reported to the police?
Stalking,fp07r2x,t1_fnpcs8m,1588204062.0,Your boyfriend doesn’t know her full name??

Stalking,fp05gu5,t3_g4ok98,1588202844.0,Can you explain more on how this would be classified and prosecuted as a sex crime?
Stalking,fp0556v,t3_g7i9sg,1588202673.0,"Have you reached out to any of his other ex’s to see if this is happening to them?

Edit: Sorry I posted before I was done. It does seem like you’re being targeted. Even if you don’t think you are or you’re having doubts, keep a file hidden away somewhere of ALL screenshots, dates, times and everything. Build your own case. Keep a journal too. I’ve had to do this with my ex."
Stalking,fp04046,t1_fotprxm,1588202060.0,That person is obviously emotionally fueled from your post. Don’t listen to them. Keep trying to do better and get rid of this burden. Make peace with yourself and those you’ve hurt.
Stalking,fozzzot,t3_gahkw7,1588199922.0,"How did this guy confess this to you? Via oral communication? If so, you can look up your local state laws regarding audio recording another person without their consent. If you do, I would try to have another conversation with him about it and record him. Or, you could simulate this via text so you have screenshots from his own number."

NarcissisticAbuse,fkwo2z2,t1_fkv4pup,1584598896.0,This is an interesting viewpoint. Thank you.

ptsd,fkvm381,t1_fk5y0vm,1584572007.0,Yw! and thank you for letting me know how.

Is there something you did specifically to hide most of this comment within the post?"
NarcissisticAbuse,fjfxmyu,t1_fjebz5d,1583303429.0,"“I feel like I have to come stronger like we are in some competition of who is the real ME.”

I relate. Do you still feel like you have to outdo them in order to gain your identity back?"
NarcissisticAbuse,fjfxgse,t3_fcxwye,1583303267.0,"I had a friend that would copy my style, suddenly be into the same music, wanted the same body modifications, would peruse goals and interests I had, tried to get close to my friends/romantic interests, and even began dating an ex shortly after we broke up. I remember when I brought it up to them how uncomfortable I was with them dating so damn soon after we broke up they had the gall to say I should be happy that they found someone that likes them. At that point isn’t my ex just liking another version of me? 

It felt like a competition, but more so of a competition with myself, and it made me lose interest in my hobbies that they copied and tried to make their own and gain clout from it. I lost my individuality. It’s been years since I went no contact and I’m still affected in ways. 

They never belittled me for my mannerisms or things I would say but they mirrored mine and other people’s mannerisms and quirks on the spot. They agreed with me when I was in a really depressed state and made a few insecure comments about my physical appearance, which was a horrific blow to anyone struggling, especially a “friend.” They would also lie about major things that could be legally devastating to those they were lying about."
