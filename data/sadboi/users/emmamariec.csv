AgeGap,f9kss5h,t3_e5m9nj,1575407149.0,"Yeah, a couple times! Not to officially be with though, which is understandable. I was 30 when the guy was 17, had a casual thing which lasted for 2 years. The age of consent is 16 in the UK and he was almost 18 anyway and looked a lot older. It was really fun. He was so good in bed for his age! Then I was sort of involved with a guy who was 21 when I was also 30, the whole horrible mess lasted again casually for 2 years. I was infatuated but he was not a kind or honest person, with me at least, I was very used and strung along. Why do you ask the question?"

AgeGap,f6ncpe8,t3_drupar,1572988817.0,Do it. If you like each other the age really shouldn't make a difference. That 4 years will seem like not much at all in a few years time. Good luck :)
Buddhism,f6k99ue,t3_drk5ep,1572907921.0,"Since avoiding news (I tend to mainly find out things through other people/only see the big headlines on social media and then don't often read the articles) I feel loads better too. I also worry about the avoidance of suffering, but then my job is transcribing police interviews so I am immersed in it each working day. Do whatever you feel comfortable with, just remain connected and compassionate with other people in the universe, that's the important thing."
AgeGap,f6j0wkm,t1_f56vixf,1572887442.0,"Thanks for your reply on this. I totally agree, he has a girlfriend and it could be no more than friendship. Still deciding whether it's best to try meeting him or not really."

AgeGap,f5az0r7,t1_f56strw,1572115584.0,"You are completely right to say I need to ask myself some questions. I don't feel like I do want children. At the same time it has been torture being infatuated with not only one but two men much younger than me, and I do think I need to get over myself and go for men nearer my age. Lots of it is because I feel I wasted my youth, I was severely depressed and missed out on a lot of opportunities. Because of that I think I have been vicariously trying to live through younger people or something. I also am more sexually attracted to younger men, but that I am just going to have to get over too. Thanks for your advice x"

AgeGap,f0t5e2j,t1_f0sk8ch,1568916213.0,Blunt but most probably definitely correct
AgeGap,f0sfimu,t1_f0sd20e,1568904090.0,"He always made out that it was the main reason he was unsure about us. He didn't want to tell his family etc. But more of a part of me believes he probably just wasn't that into me, stringing me along until he felt confident to meet someone else. Was just curious about other age gap breakups, especially where the woman was older and how they got through it."
