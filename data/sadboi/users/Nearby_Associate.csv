So even when there are those small changes, you prob won‚Äôt just mind because you got your life back. And there are other things to focus on instead of eating!!

2) it keeps me accountable! Caro is so problematic, seems to be unable to learn and a great way to reflect my own problems. For example one of you said that she seems to think that being wrong and having to apologize = being bad, which is something I also used to believe unconsciously a few years ago, and had to practice apologizing.

3) she‚Äôs super materialistic! I‚Äôm also into beutiful things, clothing etc but seeing her in her filthy apartment full of nice things has sort of kicked me out of my super materialistic behaviours lol and I have become more mindful about my consumption.

I was ‚Äùthe fat kid‚Äù so feeling beautiful, desirable, fashionable and accepted was something I didn‚Äôt know anything about

But at the same time I was s o envious to girls who were on a healthy weight, how things like food didn‚Äôt seem to be a problem to them, they seemed beautiful with a bit of tummy and curvy legs and long beautiful, healthy hair. And they seemed that they are l o v e d by their peers and by themselves. They were actually living their life, while I felt like I am hollow, lifeless and look old, feel old since everything hurted. I started to hate when people just picked me up like I was nothing and random strangers called me anorexic or said that I look like a kid. I felt stupid since I couldn‚Äôt even think straight and have meaningful conversations with my friends from uni. I was just dumb and full of hate, an underdog someone pitied a bit sometimes and almost managed to destroy my relationship, because I am a huge bitch when restricting and it felt like everything was personal insult towards me. 

I‚Äôm not def saying I‚Äôm recovered and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever manage to deal with a huge weight gain, I still feel guilty about eating. 

But at the same time like fuck I want to love myself! I want to be loved, I want to be kind to myself and everyone else, I want to live and create meaningful things. I want to be able to support myself, have beautiful things around me. And if I can‚Äôt even feed myself, how could I love myself? I‚Äôm still definitely skinny, but prob not underweight. I‚Äôm giving my body lots of protein and vitamins. Prob going to start a bit of exercising, but only the kind of exercise I actually like and makes me feel good. My cheeks already seem fuller and I‚Äôm trying really hard not to hate it.

If my work (especially videos) is in critique, I might just close my eyes since I don‚Äôt want to watch it again. But that‚Äôs just dumb, and in a way CC is doing the same. You shouldn‚Äôt feel ashamed of what you do, but also you should be open for conversation and also critique."

I have ittybitty boobs and haven‚Äôt been wearing bras in years but I have huge nipples, people have actually asked me if I have breastfeeded with them (I‚Äôm 22 ). So maybe if my boobs were bigger, it would look more natural but at the same time I love small tiddy frame"

I think symptoms can really vary, and untreatable stomach ulcer can be dangerous but for temporary relief for example some plain yogurt may help especially if your symptoms get worse at night."

This reddit community has been so far the only community where actually people can support eachother and where I feel safe. It seems at least to me that especially in non-English speaking countries - like where I live - and their ed forums get incredibly toxic real quick. I don‚Äôt know if people in here are just more shittier or if it has something to do with the language - English is def more polite one - or that people just don‚Äôt know how to have a conversation on the internet lol

So I love you guys and I need you guys, let‚Äôs keep this place safe and report that kind of behaviour"

I feel you, there are ideal pictures of these two desirable gals and both seem unobtainable"
