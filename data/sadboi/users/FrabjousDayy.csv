SkincareAddiction,fmbov1w,t3_fu1eiy,1585930497.0,"I just ordered the Niacinamide+Zinc and the Mandelic acid (both from The Ordinary). I know to use the N+Z in the am and mandelic in the pm, both before moisturizer and sunscreen. However, for the past year I have been using a Clindamycin Phosphate+Tretinoin gel from my derm and while it has helped I am not sure it is doing much anymore other than just maintaining what it did. Do I continue with that and if so how do I incorporate it into the new routine once my Ordinary products arrive?"

buffy,fh9dzmk,t3_evlgww,1581379083.0,"I think their relationship was incredibly toxic, buffy used spike while treating him like shit and then the whole rape scene was horrible. However, I love Spike. I know he's not ""good"" but he is also a fictional character and I think he not only adds a lot to the show as far as helping the Scoobs and his funny lines but he has such good chemistry with so many other characters. I won't ignore the attempted rape scene, but I also can't not love his character and how much he changed and grew over the course of the show. He is also way more complex and interesting to watch than Angel or Riley. But if other people dislike him, that is fine."

buffy,fh8x8bo,t3_f1lq5r,1581369231.0,"I personally don't think the show would have had as much of an impact on audiences and on popculture history if it was written that way. I enjoyed seeing the character growth, the mistakes they all make, the real life struggles as they grow up, and I think a large city of LA would have given the show a completely diff vibe than Sunnydale."

South asian families put a lottttt of pressure on their kids to be perfect and also don't talk about mental health ever. I highly suspect she killed herself and her family is in denial. I am south asian and I know how much of an issue this is in the community.

flexibility,f9kwc4p,t3_e5iote,1575409189.0,I think a. lots of those methods are hella outdated b. kids are naturally more bendy than adults and c. active stretching and strength training are probably better for adults to become more flexible than just sitting in a static position and hoping to get more stretchy

vegan,eq0bymo,t1_eq0bcf6,1559681798.0,"Oh I definitely agree, however I could not convince them that supporting the even ""ethical"" consumption of a loved pet's eggs can lead to a wider acceptance of something that just needs to stop (eating eggs, regardless of where it comes from) so maybe it is a lost cause.."
vegan,eq0aroj,t1_eq0afpj,1559681175.0,Yes I agree with the points about them not being vegan and not having any superior nutrition that couldn't be found in a plant based food. But their argument was that it would be a waste when people in need could eat them. To which I didn't know what to say..
vegan,eq0agy3,t3_bwkwmf,1559681021.0,"As an Indian thanks for sharing this. I am so tired of the massive disconnect in India of animal worship but those same animals not having basic rights. People think being vegetarian in India (for God) is so auspicious but the minute I mention I am vegan for ethics people get borderline angry with me saying I am crazy, overboard, not making sense. etc. Dairy is basically in everything in India. I actually struggled to be vegan in India, especially in the north where butter, milk and cream are in EVERYTHING. People also think that cows are sacred and worshiped in India, which yes they are, but also that worship goes one way. It is for the blessing of people, but those same cows are beaten off roads, have to live off eating trash on roads (because they are essentially stray and have no food) and in general are not actually given any semblance of a good life just because they are ""worshipped"". People in India use religion to exploit cows, it sickens me."
vegan,eq09po7,t1_eq09jkq,1559680622.0,"true, there really is nothing else I could have said I suppose"
vegan,eq09arp,t1_eq08ufc,1559680403.0,"Yes true, I did bring up the points of the chickens not being here for us to use or for us to take their bodily fluids. And there is no nutritional benefit to eating eggs that cannot be bought from the grocery store, like a can of beans. But they just kept telling me that the eggs would rot and would go to waste. The conversation kept going in circles so I sort of left it, seeing no point in arguing further lol."
vegan,eq093xt,t1_eq08xok,1559680304.0,"That was another point they made, that they don't want any male chickens since they are essentially useless (they don't wanna breed their chickens I guess) so they say eating eggs would prevent males from hatching."
vegan,eq08yg9,t1_eq08pfo,1559680230.0,"I am not sure whether or not their chickens are rescues. I think their point was, their chickens are already adopted, they cannot undo that. They argue that the damage as far as that point goes is done, but not eating the eggs would be a waste. To which I wasn't sure what to say."
