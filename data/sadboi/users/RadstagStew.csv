I think I'll wait it out a few more months since I've already been doing that and bring it up with my Rheumatologist when I see her. When I tried explaining this to a gynecologist a couple years ago they seemed confused and told me to take a higher dose of ibuprophen. Which helps a bit but not with the weird tingly pain and it doesn't mix well with vomiting. 

I've wondered about endometriosis but I have so many diagnoses that I've been hesitant to possibly have another to manage so I just tell myself I'm a hypochondriac.

I have avoided Xanax for CPTSD and GAD but I think if I just took a super low dose when I get these symptoms it wouldn't be a problem. Anything to function better at this point!"

When I left the JWs my mom asked me if I was a lesbian. I thought that was really weird. I eventually started to have thoughts about women but kept pushing them back. Eventually made out and messed around with a girl but just saw it as experimenting. 

Eventually I got in the relationship I am in. After our honeymoon phase wore off I started to have thoughts about women again. I opened up about them a tiny bit on a blog. Eventually I dropped hints about being attracted to women with my partner. He seemed to know all along lol!

He is very supportive about me being bisexual. He even encourages me to go find a woman if I ever want to, he doesnt want to get involved or anything weird, but has told me he wants me to be able to express my sexuality if I feel the need. 

There were some times I was okay with being bisexual, other times I was in denial about it. Now I've accepted it. And looking back through my life it all makes sense. Now I just have to learn how not to be awkward and afraid of girls in that context! Lol. But for now I am happy with him and I don't really desire to find a woman.

I never had an experience with a cult leader but I was a child who got roped into one. That toxic mindset pops into your brain like two puzzle pieces fitting together when there's unresolved trauma. It makes it easy to travel from abusive relationship to high control group to... etc. or a combination of many abusive situations at once! You can get comfortable with it in a way.

Glad to see these girls stepping up and speaking out against him, that had to be an incredibly difficult place to get to. But it is apparent they are well on the road to healing.

My experience admitting myself for suicidal urges was traumatizing. And that's after a childhood of trauma and growing up with emotional abuse. 

The staff confused and scared me. The Psychiatrist I saw there didn't seem to really care about finding out what was going on, just enforcing what HE thought was. I even disliked the way he sat, on the edge of the chair with his legs spread so wide his junk poked though. It felt so invasive. One nurse yelled at me and shoved my bed against the wall. Another nurse tech called a lot of the patients a ""Diva"" in a really sarcastic way. They misdiagnosed me with borderline personality disorder too. Had to recover from it all over the next few years.

I'm concerned for patients that might go through this or worse in the future. Is there anything I can or should do? Who would I report to? Has it been too long, this was 2015?"
Psychosis,f7h7th8,t3_dw1pcm,1573734525.0,"I can relate to what you are saying here. I had a psychotic break in 2015. Ended up in the hopsittal, had a horrible experience there. It was very stressful and confusing for my aunt (she is basically my mom) and my boyfriend. I had no idea what was going on either.

I isolated and pushed everyone away at various degrees for years. I was also very confused about what happened, and admittedly I still am. Its only the last few months I have not been suicidal and have felt more accepting and less guilty about the psychotic break. I worked hard in therapy and keep pushing out of my comfort zone in small ways. Slowly opening myself up to other people who feel safe.

Don't give up and keep trying to recover and be the person you want to be. Just don't be hard on yourself about the time it takes to heal. 

As for whether or not you have ptsd from it, I can't say. But it is possible. I already had ptsd from past trauma but I do get flashbacks to my hospital experience and notice it generally just feels like a trauma response. Psychosis is traumatic, no denying it.

I felt there was no way I would ever muster the strength to feel better and function and heal from all the trauma. Even after going to therapy and staying in the hospital for a couple weeks.

After a long period of agoraphobia I started pushing myself little by little. But during that dark period I'll admit I was looking for any reason to stay in my bubble of safety and comfort.

I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to this. Who knows if they're truly feeling helpless. I agree that mental illness is no excuse to treat other people like shit. But I do understand how overwhelming it is before you figure out what works for you. The process can take years. Some people just stay in their cocoons longer.

Everybody experiences trauma and it affects us all differently. And everyone has a different threshold when it comes to what hurts. I do see where you are coming from though. I just try not to judge people. As long as they aren't being abusive and calling it mental illness or things of that nature."

ptsd,f5nywvy,t3_do8on4,1572306330.0,"Exercise- lots of walking, some yoga. Gotta expand that extra energy.

Meals- I eat a lot of soup because its hard to eat when I have a flare up. Protein bars too. No matter how hard it is to get the food down, I force myself. Missing meals makes things way worse.

Sleep- bedtime routine and go to bed at the same time every night, even if its the weekend. For me, if my sleep is messed up one night it can make it impossible to get sleep the next.

CBD- it does wonders for me to take CBD through a tincture during the day, and I eat a gummy at night. Helps with nausea and sleeping.

Tea- I drink chamomile with lavender all day and it takes a little bit of the edge off. NO CAFFEINE DURING A FLAREUP. I do love my coffee but it only makes things worse.

Triggers- I pay attention to the physical sensations I feel when I get triggered. I IMMEDIATELY note that I am feeling triggered and do breathing exercises that I learned in therapy. If it is constant fight or flight I hang out in my room and listen to music until it dies down a little. Baths help too but I don't have a tub right now. If I am dissociating I hold an ice cube and use my senses to note everything around me.

Other than that, I let someone close to me know what's going on. I usually want to isolate but I've found that in the long term that can make things worse. Its really important to have a support system, my PTSD didn't really improve until I did.

There was one flare up for me where I was hardly eating and not sleeping. I lost touch with reality. Ended up going to the ER and staying in a hospital for two weeks. I haven't had a flare up that severe since then but in the back of my mind I am willing to go to the hospital if it ever gets that bad again. Don't be afraid to seek help."

He helped me through a suicidal period and I don't think I would have been okay if it weren't for his support. You are absolutely right it is a miracle. You are so important. Everyone is. A lot of us just don't see it yet.

For me its the small things. I cling to them from one moment to the next. When I resolved that I was going to recover that's what I started doing. Pretty view outside the window? Revel in it. A delicious smell? Inhale that deeply several times and savor it. Cat being cute? Pet and ooze over them for a bit. See another human do something funny? Laugh and appreciate that they exist before you move on.

Through this I learned to use my senses more. I was shutting it all down with the depression. I'm still depressed, don't get me wrong.

It was very routine focused. Meals, support groups, meds, getting vitals checked, etc. I had a room mate and we shared a bathroom. Once I was on the right medications and got my appetite back I really enjoyed the cafeteria food. The hardest part was not being able to get fresh air. Expect lots of crafts and coloring pages. They had a payphone there we could use but there was also an office phone they would let me use to have short conversations with loved ones.

depression,ey0bfjl,t3_cuu87a,1566676826.0,Yesss. I can relate to that so much. I am or often feel misunderstood because of it. Sorry you go through this too. But thank you for saying something about it I feel less alone.
CPTSD,exqho9l,t3_ctkyg3,1566502365.0,"It really takes a toll on our bodies. Sorry to hear you have to live with all of that. Hope you get the help you need. I've been diagnosed with Sjogrens syndrome and PMDD. I get frequent nerve pain in my lower back and sciatica issues too. I definitely get worse flareups during times of stress, much like everyone else here."
CPTSD,exqgv3v,t3_ctwebt,1566502102.0,Yes same for me. Sorry you have to go through it too. It can be debilitating. I got a period tracker app and keeping an eye on my cycle helps me mentally prepare.

SuicideWatch,eusab7g,t3_ch5tsy,1564005371.0,"The day I was going to stand on the train tracks as soon as I saw a train was the day that I met a utility truck working on the tracks. I walked to my therapists office from there. In the ER that day I had a few people there who showed me they care. Its been a hard fight to choose life but there's been many many little things that made me smile or feel a glimpse of happiness ever since that day. When I saw that utility truck I felt so hurt and disappointed. But now 7 months later even though I'm still severely depressed and sleep most days away there's those little things that get me by. Hoping someday there will be bigger things too.

I know if you keep fighting you will find little things too. Treasure them. I'm so sorry for the pain and disappointment you're feeling right now. Please reach out to someone you care about and talk about what happened if you can."

ptsd,es503u2,t3_c5su1u,1561598419.0,"Same here. I've been getting fillings recently and she always comments on how nervous I am. It took me over 10 years to work up the courage to go. I have to get my wisdom tooth out, it cracked apart, but the idea of going under is terrifying. I keep putting it off. Just know you're not alone. I hope it gets easier for you soon."
