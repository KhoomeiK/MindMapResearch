BPD,fmjf3qa,t3_fvlswm,1586129055.0,So happy for you. I’m thankful you’re still here :) I also have limited people to share my mental health successes with. Keep your head up love x
BPD,fmbzx1y,t1_fmb2yj3,1585936305.0,"It’s like i’m dissociating and mentally going back to times where I was verbally abused, the level of panic feels so similar"
BPD,fljxxro,t1_flj727q,1585229521.0,"You should try filling up a small tupperware of water for him, my ferrets used to go crazy for that . Theyd drunk their faces in and then run around my room. haha"
BPD,flite4r,t3_fozcbk,1585190266.0,My ferrets were seriously my best friends for all 8 years of their lives. The BEST animal I’ve ever had as a pet. So goofy with their weasel war dances!!
BPD,f47bvgi,t1_f46lgsa,1571420205.0,i feel you on this
BPD,f442lb1,t3_djbp4c,1571347478.0,"My ex and I used to have conversations like this often. Always initiated by me starting the ""you don't care about/ love me"" dialogue. I think it could be helpful to give him some time to sort through his bad mood, he can't help you if he's not taking care of himself as well. 

I have often felt in your position of feeling neglected and betrayed when my Ex didn't ask me how I was doing... but I think people w/o BPD don't understand how a meltdown can affect us into the next day or for a couple days. I think either stating how you feel later today, or telling him you want him to ask how you are doing could be helpful. Try to be upfront about your feelings. I hope this is at least a little helpful. 

xx"
BPD,f43x1ld,t3_dix3vz,1571346002.0,"Yep. ME 100%. And I hate that I do this, but it feels uncontrollable. I recently FINALLY got rid of the medication I was hoarding in case. In case I was finally ready to make a serious attempt.

I flushed them down the toilet during a strong impulsive moment of knowing that it's super dangerous for me to have them-- and then proceeded to cry for about an hour about flushing them."
