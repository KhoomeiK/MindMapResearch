I'll be going into my third year of business soon, and honestly even now I wonder if I went the right way, should have done another subject or even a trade. I originally wanted to do journalism but my very math/science oriented parents objected to that. Business seemed like something even I could do and would get me a job. At least thats what I hope, but you're right. The job market is screwed and people are panicking. All I can say is I'm going to get older year by year so I might as well keep working, and getting that dumb piece of paper is, I think, better than not having one.

Also, just by reading your story I feel you probably don't have a lot of faith in yourself, and are nervous to ""compete"" with smarter people. When I first started I was terrified I was too stupid and would drop, but I'm still going and I gotta say maybe I should believe in myself a little more, and maybe you too?

But fuck what do I know. Good luck dude, do what you think yourself in 4/5 years would be able to smile about. (and hey again- just getting the paper is useful, doesn't mean you gotta act like einstein just get the credidentials to get your foot in the door)"
