Anxiety,fkqwch3,t1_fkqvt5g,1584456963.0,"Counselling is just as important if not more then the medication, we have to talk through and work through the things that are causing the anxiety in order to overcome it. I also have the issue of finding an affordable counsellor, it’s so expensive these day but it is vital, our mental health is so important. I would suggest looking into betterhelp.com it is an online counselling service, and it’s very affordable. You are able to choose from phone call, text chat or video call, and all are licensed therapists."

Anxiety,fkqvo9v,t1_fkqv6w4,1584456547.0,"My medicine gave me my life back, sometimes we need it to get over the obstacle and get our mind back to a place where it’s able to help us see through the lies anxiety and depression tell us. This medicine was given to you to help you not harm you, the doctor administered a safe dose and prescription that’s right for you! You are safe, I know it’s scary that first time, but you’re stronger then you think! You took that leap and went to get help, which is very hard for some people. Maybe after taking the pill do something to distract your mind, meditating really helps me during stressful moments."

I always feel as if I’m the parent, she acts out and she’s childish, immature at times and it’s embarrassing. I get anxiety from her behaviour and I’ve finally got to the point where I’m soo tired of it that now I just put her in her place. I think as long as I’m good with my words and don’t allow her to make me furious my anxiety lessens."

I’m in the same boat, I’m dealing with a lot of boredom, emptiness, breakdowns, and just overthinking. My head feels clearer then it’s ever felt. I know this is gonna be worth it. We’ve got this:))) 
Some things that can help with the boredom:
Working out or just going on a walk 
Reading 
Drawing or painting 
Anything you used to enjoy before the weed!"
leaves,fkhbbsc,t3_fig2zm,1584194447.0,"I wanted to start off by saying you accomplished a lot with this post, you were able to identify the problem. I’m also having a lot of trouble quitting and relate to a lot of things in your post. I always wonder if I’m gonna loose my personality when I quit but I realize it’s fake, we shouldn’t have to smoke in order to feel ourselves. We need to take control of our life and our thoughts, we need to find who we are without the weed. It’s hard at the beginning, I’m only a couple days in and I feel empty but at the same time I feel like I’m really here and not just on auto pilot. My head feel clearer already. There are some withdrawal effects because our body and mind has to figure out how to function without the weed. But it’s so worth it. We’ve got this"

Anxiety,fd86yms,t1_fcx2htp,1578214567.0,"Thank you!!! For me it’s because I used to have this fear about throwing up when having a panic attack, I still do but the fears gotten manageable at last! I was always scared to put anything in my stomach because I thought I would throw up. Then I was put into a ED inpatient for 2 months because I was medically unstable, I got very thin because of anxiety. They just started convincing me I had some sort of ED and never touched on the anxiety, so I was force fed 9 times a day a huge amount, it just increased my fear of food more. But I’m finally at a healthy weight and I think I have more control on my thoughts now. I definitely get worried about people talking as well! I would say take small baby steps, nothing big at first, maybe going on for coffee, or a fast food place and eating in the car, and then move to going to a food place you’re comfortable at if you have one. Having someone youre comfortable with helps so much, especially if they know the situation. I also can say I always worried about if I would have anxiety while I’m at the restaurant but when you’re there and distracted you don’t have enough time to think about the anxiety. You can do this! Always here for you:)"
Anxiety,fd85w3q,t1_fcwmnrt,1578214254.0,"I was like that for 2 years, I stopped my entire life, even dropped out of school, I had such big dreams, and I just gave into my anxiety and stayed in my comfort spot. The biggest tip is challenge your anxiety, I went out again tonight, to a bar, with new people and my mom, I never thought I’d do that. It’s always scary at the start, but once your there and actually distracted, you don’t think about anxiety 24/7 unless it’s like holy shit I’m doing this I’m really fkn doing this. It’s such an amazing feeling. I believe that we go through these things and we come out a different person, a greater person. We begin to control our anxiety, I know it’s crazy hearing it. But the day will come I promise you, pls don’t give up, and don’t give in. You’ve made it through 100% of your worst days already!! You can do this."
