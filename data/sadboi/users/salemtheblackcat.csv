TrollXChromosomes,fpqxe1i,t1_fpqorx6,1588835154.0,"The first historical record of Lilith originates in ancient Sumerian culture, where she was regarded as either a demon or goddess. Her name is theorized to be derived from the word ""lilitu"", which translates to something like night demon, female demon, and/or wind demon. She's also described as the hand of Inanna/Ishtar, Sumerian goddess of love and war. It's said that she would prey upon young children and ""lead men astray"" with her beauty and sexuality. 
Lilith is associated owls because they are predatory creatures of the night and lilitu are described as having talons for feet and the wings of a bird. 

Jewish mythology adopted this concept of a promiscuous, dangerous night demoness that became the version of Lilith mentioned in the Old Testament. This is the version of her being Adam's first wife who refused to submit to him. She then leaves the garden of Eden and becomes a demon who gives birth to lots of other demons, seduces men, and has the ability to harm young children and pregnant women.

In modern times, she's been regarded as a figure of sexual empowerment and sexual agency. She was a figurehead of second wave feminism for Jewish women. 

Honestly, I love Lilith, her story and self are absolutely awesome and I just!!! She's great!!!"

I know logically I've been disrespected, and he's done other things that were unsavory, but I can't help but feel desperate for validation and love.
