Iâ€™m reopening the question since I donâ€™t think itâ€™s neither of those. 

They grow new leaves in a different way than the two species that were mentioned. New leaves start somewhere from the middle of the base plant and then gradually work their way up to the top. Or sometimes they start directly from the soil in this tiny bulb like thing. 

I recently repotted them and theyâ€™ve been miserable ever since, Iâ€™m not sure what to do to save them!"

I think having to breakup with someone and also move out of the house at the same time is even more difficult and painful. If it comes to that, please make sure to be supportive until you know sheâ€™s moved wherever she wants to be next, back to her hometown, or maybe somewhere else."
relationship_advice,ff5o2l4,t1_ff51ccg,1579602661.0,"So sheâ€™s living thousands of miles away from her hometown, as far I understand, only doing housework. Does she have any savings? Friends in the city you live in? 

I know this is not what the post is about, but damn, thatâ€™s some financially insecure position to be in. Like imagine the power dynamics of this breakup. 

But I guess thatâ€™s a lesson for the both of you, donâ€™t ever fall into an arrangement like this again."

Iâ€™m 26 and I was thinking just today that Iâ€™m not sure if I can 100% undo some of these thinking patterns anymore, and that maybe itâ€™s too late to try. Reading that you managed to do that in your 30â€™s gives me hope that I should keep trying. 

Your daughter is lucky to have you."
