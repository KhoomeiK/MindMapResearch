I think ESH. Yes, I completely understand that your husband is exhausted from always being “the bad guy”. Giving out punishments just for you to swoop in and undermine him because you could not stop coddling your son. 

But he should’ve spoken to you about it a long time ago. You should both be in therapy as well as your son, and family therapy. 

You need to apologize to your husband, tell him you want to be a united front, and lay down the law with your son. 

Tell him you respect him as a person, but this game has gone on long enough. You love him, but you are the parents, and until he moves out he needs to follow the rules. No drinking, no drugs, all assignments need to be turned in when due. Give reasonable consequences if he breaks the new rules, which I’m certain he will. 

It will feel like you’re being too harsh, but do not back down. He may even cut you off, because he’s been living HIS way for so long. Stay equal with your husband, lean on him when you feel like breaking down. Let him lean on you. Your son does not run your household."

insaneparents,fkquzhh,t3_fk65o7,1584456126.0,"I mean, it really depends? I was a “hungry” kid. I’d get a full meal and then 5 minutes later say I’m hungry because I was bored or wanted more attention. 

Obviously if she really isn’t feeding her kid then she’s insane, but if the case of the kid saying he’s hungry, while literally putting food in his mouth, it’s a different story"

If she needs help, then she can be an adult and ask for help. She’s stealing from you, and she’s is not owed anything! Your open door policy isn’t changing, really, either. You’re telling her to do what her siblings do, respect you, your home, and your things."

We’ll set something down, multiple people will see it there, and then in a matter of minutes it’ll be gone. It’ll be gone for anywhere from minutes to days. And then it’ll just, be there again. Exactly where we put it the first time"

AskReddit,fkoiqcy,t3_fjep7t,1584388026.0,"That some people live in one house their entire lives, or until college. That a typical family is filled with maybe 4 people. We moved around so much, because mom couldn’t keep a job with two kids, and the rent kept going up for my dad, not to mention we payed more in utilities than rent because we had 10+ people in one trailer. 

Until my dad, me, and step mom 1 moved to Michigan, my whole family either lived together or right next to each other and we were all very dependent on each other. It was a nightmare"

It’s still obviously not the same as Lysol, or any cleaning product, and she shouldn’t be using it as such."

AmItheAsshole,fkhz5q8,t1_fkhwl87,1584208712.0,"I agree with this. My husband tells me constantly that he loves me, and how attractive he thinks I am. We live together and I get that affection constantly. If he tells one of his close girl friends she looks nice, what? Once maybe every 6 months? I don’t get upset, maybe internally jealous but that’s my problem, not his. I get to go home with him and hear it everyday after that.

You’re allowed to have girl friends, and show affection with them. There’s boundaries, sure. But a hug and a spin isn’t a bad thing."
AmItheAsshole,fkhysg7,t3_fii8mx,1584208515.0,"As another woman, NTA. Maybe I’ll get downvoted, but if your fiancé has such a problem, then she needs to be an adult and voice those concerns. 

It doesn’t sound like your fiancé trusts you, or your BF, which I find ridiculous as she’s also getting married. You’re allowed to have a girl best friend, and you’re allowed to stick up for that person. The fact that you’re also friends with her fiancé, just sticks the NTA for me. 

I’m a very very jealous person, due to past relationships. My husband knows this, and he has some female and male friends I do not enjoy. It is not my place to tell him who can and cannot be friends with, but I have told him about my discomfort and he reassures me and I trust him. 

You need to have a very serious conversation with your fiancé. Lay it all out on the line. If she can’t respect your other relationships, then something is very wrong. You obviously need to respect her opinions, and see if there’s a compromise somewhere. But if she wants you to cut these people out completely, that’s a huge red flag IMO. 

Good luck OP"
