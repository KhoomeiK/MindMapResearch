schizophrenia,fo5jys0,t1_fo4wcp3,1587527497.0,Do you miss writing? I think my meds messed storytelling up for me
schizophrenia,fo5jwvj,t1_fo50hom,1587527459.0,"Yikes is the word for it! I lost my best friend at the time, and I, until now, had no clue why she stopped talking to me (I even talked about it in depth in my entries) Its very clear now. Its crazy what sz can do when it’s just running in the background."
schizophrenia,fmfad9e,t1_fmf49bk,1586023125.0,"That’s good to hear, its a kickass hobby. Alltrails app is a good resource for lesser known trails that may not shut down and won’t be crowded. Thanks!:)"
schizophrenia,fmethdg,t3_ftqb7s,1586013148.0,WOW. I’d literally buy that
AppalachianTrail,fm2lxhr,t1_flvkrr9,1585700205.0,And now Jefferson and George Washington Nat’l Forests have closed trailheads and access points. And closures in Virginia and our surrounding areas are going to continue every day.

schizophrenia,esoytsr,t3_c8m9m6,1562176365.0,"I’ve been on Seroquel for 3 years now. The first few months were the hardest. Waking up was so hard and I was groggy and irritable, especially at work. It got better after the first month, but then my dose would get upped, and it would be shitty for a few weeks again, repeat the cycle. After I was stable on a dosage, things got considerably better after about 3 months. I’ve had no problems at all for the past two years, but I sleep great at night.

For now, try to start taking it a bit earlier in the evening so you don’t sleep as late, if that’s a problem. If not, just hang on and enjoy the ride. It’ll get better!"
schizophrenia,erw661y,t3_c4etsy,1561334347.0,"We woke up at 4:30am and hiked two miles through the dark for the sunrise. One of my favorite days on trail, and the first time a view brought a tear to my eye. Almost halfway through my home state:) Thank you all for the support"
schizophrenia,erw5qmp,t1_er39cbd,1561334000.0,"I didn’t know any of that! Thank you for bringing that up, I’ll definitely look further into that. That is more than possible in my case"
schizophrenia,erw5lez,t1_eqy0bna,1561333880.0,Thank you so much!!
schizophrenia,erw5hut,t1_er41i88,1561333798.0,Hell yeah! I will keep you posted
schizophrenia,erw5gzs,t1_er4kgds,1561333778.0,"We are half way through VA! Sorry for the late reply, just hit a town"
AskReddit,er5llsn,t1_eqzifwq,1560528543.0,I scrolled hard through this thread to find someone from Kugyay! I never used to the original Kugyay but I spent YEARS of my life on Wolf Kugyay. I credit that site and all of those people for how deep I am in writing over a decade later. Super cool to see somebody.
schizophrenia,er1k4g1,t1_er04y11,1560432922.0,"Oh no! Lol we just came off 6 days straight of rain, and I have chafed in places I didn’t even know could chafe"
schizophrenia,er1jzf9,t1_eqzr6qr,1560432868.0,"That’s a great question! This hike has definitely impacted my symptoms. I think the biggest factor in that is that I am never, ever stressed out. I genuinely can’t remember the last time I was stressed, and even very minor stress for me is like pouring gasoline on a schizophrenia fire. 

I think intense exercise, beautiful views, and accomplishing goals all plays into it as well. This is the first time in my life I’ve been comfortable around groups of people, too."
schizophrenia,er1iwjf,t1_eqz675m,1560432472.0,"That’s so kind, but we already made it through Tennessee! The Roan Highlands were by far my favorite section of trail though, you’ve got a lot of beauty in your backyard. Big Hump Mountain literally brought a tear to my eye."
schizophrenia,er1ifov,t1_eqz3w8b,1560432302.0,"That’s an awesome goal, and it seems like a gorgeous trail!"
schizophrenia,er1iccb,t1_eqz1wrv,1560432265.0,A little too much traffic if you ask me! I hike alone all day but people bunch up in the evenings at the shelters and tent sites.
schizophrenia,er1i6yx,t1_eqwv7yk,1560432205.0,"We just came out of a 6 days streak of rain, so I am soggy but happy, haha!"
schizophrenia,er1i2sw,t1_eqw6r7b,1560432160.0,Thanks! I will definitely get better about posting updates lol
schizophrenia,er1i0dj,t1_eqvufk6,1560432134.0,The trail does run through them and now I’m even more excited to hike them! Thank you!
schizophrenia,er1hvwo,t1_eqvk4o4,1560432082.0,"Thank you! Definitely go for it one day, its a blast. 

I love exercising everyday and I love setting short and long term goals and actually meeting them. I’ve never felt such a strong feeling of accomplishment like when we hit the hundred mile marks and pass through towns and hit other landmarks. I already feel much more confident that I’ll be able to actually stick to things and meet goals when I’m finished with the trail. 

Hard terrain and bad weather haven’t gotten me down yet, but the one part I’m not a huge fan of is how social the trail is. I hike alone all day for the most part, but when you reach shelters and designated tent sites there are always people there. In the beginning I camped with about 15-20 people every night, and now its down to about 2-5 a night. It has definitely helped lessen my social anxiety and improve my social skills (every single person is incredibly kind and easy to talk to), but it is a bit hard to get alone time when needed."
schizophrenia,eqvjq81,t3_bzr7v7,1560346090.0,"Its been a hell of a ride, but I am totally confident I’ll finish this trail. I haven’t been able to post or comment here but I check up on the sub every chance I get. I hope you guys are doing well:)"
