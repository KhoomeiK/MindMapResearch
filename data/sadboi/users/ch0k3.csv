InsecureHBO,fqa8tku,t1_fq8gb7g,1589214858.0,Imo molly was out of pocket. I first understood her not wanting to ask Andrew because their relationship was on shakey ground but this I can't understand. It was NATHAN that asked to help. It was NATHAN that asked Andrew. If Andrew felt uncomfortable with helping he would have said no. The main reason he helped was because he thought it would make molly happy. Molly is a miserable friend who high key wanted Issa to fail. Who needs friends like they when you have enemies
