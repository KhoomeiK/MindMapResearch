malehairadvice,fqojdpr,t1_fqo9mu9,1589516597.0,You spray it in your hair before you dry it and style it. I find sometimes the bottles spray well and sometimes they don’t. I ran across that problem bc I would buy them in bulk for the barbershop. You can spray into your hands and mix. Just make sure you’re spraying it onto wet hair.
