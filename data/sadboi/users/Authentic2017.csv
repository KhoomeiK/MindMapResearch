I define stuck points as negative beliefs developed by the trauma about me, others and life at large. As I write down those beliefs I make a mental note about why I believe this and not something else related to the event. Example: I’m stupid—> because someone said so—-> I believe them because others were there and they either laughed or said nothing—-> If they were wrong someone would’ve defended me—-> so I am not safe because this means in the future others wot defend me.

CPTSD,fdi2127,t1_fdhwwco,1578434326.0,"Ya I was talking about being tired physically. 
Honestly l heard after a while reward centres shut down and your ability to feel accomplished shuts down which was why I felt indifferent after finishing a work out so I didn’t reap the same benefits as you."
CPTSD,fdhipzs,t1_fdggryg,1578423491.0,"I used to work out frequently, did track and field and was pretty strong (315x10 squat) (260 bench) and I was still tired all the time.

I think mentality trumps physicality"

CPTSD,fdgo25e,t3_el6or3,1578403658.0,"To everyone in this comment section I’d like to bring attention to what I believe could work.

Cortisol is the hormone produced in stressful situations, when it is produced over long periods of time it artificially accelerated the division of cells in your body. Your body has an X amount of times it divides its cells before you die. This means the faster your cells divide the faster you age and the sooner you die which is why stressed out people age faster (look at obama).

THE GOOD NEWS. There are herbal supplements that can reverse this! I’m not selling anything no, but if you head over to r/nootropics, you can see a list of natural supplements means to lessen depression, brain fog and stress levels. 

I take “Ashwagandha ksm66” 600mg/day. What it does is reduce cortisol, aswell as repair the damage done to the body AND brain by the stress, returning youthful energy. I’ve seen stuff about how it promotes longevity aswelll. 
My appetite returned, my body temperature went up again and I feel more calmer and clearer. You have to take these everyday as they build up in your system so you only feel the full effects after a month or so of use. 
You may benefit from the others not necessarily the one I take. But I urge EVERYONE here to take a look at r/nootropics and snoop around because I promise you’ll find something there that’ll help you. 

Have a god day."
