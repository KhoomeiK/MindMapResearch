A lot of people think having an everyday problem as having a mental illness when its nothing like it. Again I'm not saying that about people who are suffering. I have an illness that is heavily stigmatize and people love to arm chair diagnosis and make assumptions and its incredibly hard to deal with let alone when I'm having issues.
