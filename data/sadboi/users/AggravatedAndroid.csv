Been going to therapy for symptoms of depression and anxiety, and am working on a number of past traumas. During one my meditations I turned inward to my ""inner child"" and it was like a dam broke. An overwhelming flood of emotions and tears and sobsâ€”can't remember the last time I ugly-cried like that. 

It's been easier to have positive self-talk and reassuring myself as I push myself to be a better human, most of which involves opening up and being vulnerable with other humans. 

tl;dr Being compassionate towards yourself feels weird at first, but is truly transformative over time."

I'm in therapy, on meds, meditate daily, leave myself positive affirmations, and practice other self-care and it's still a daily uphill battle. Been reading up on fearlessness lately, specifically how [acting fearless is not without the feeling of fear](https://stephenguise.com/why-fearlessness-is-more-important-than-confidence/).
