Divorce,fr12aun,t3_glju45,1589811864.0,"My husband and I separated for about 6 months. I’m the guilty one, I had the emotional affair. Long story behind it, but anyways, we both dated others while separated. I’ve been back for 3 months now and yesterday we talked and decided to move forward with the divorce. Too much hurt and pain. We have been married for 22 years. At the end of this year will be 23. We both cried and hugged. We grew up together. I hate myself for it, loosing the love of my life, but I want him to be happy. He said it has felt good with me being home. It really has. Good luck. And as for when is it too soon. We’ll go with your heart. You’ll meet someone and it will just feel right. Be careful on dating sites. Most are just a bunch of guys who are out looking for sex and not much more. Hope all fairs well for you"

I always talk with my husband of 22 years about the things I like and what I want him to do to me. We watch open and I’ll say, I want you to do that to me, or can we try that? If he gets annoyed or angry when you bring it up, don’t be as giving. Let him know how you feel. If his response is hurtful, then he ain’t the one. And one last thing, the are always grabbing us by the head and shoving their dick down our throats, next tine he tries the finger slide, grab him by the hair and shove his face back down there while moaning, no! More daddy or more papi. That will turn him on."

Divorce,fok6eyz,t3_g7mnpd,1587836247.0,"Maybe it’s a sign that you should stay and try and work things out. My spouse and I were separated for about six months or more and then this pandemic happened. He asked me if I was safe. It was the first time I talked to him since we split. I told him I was living in my car because I lost the last place I had as a roof over my head. He told me I could come home. I came back and three days later, here we are back to comfort. We talk and have fun together. We have our moments where things look bleak, but we work through it. We have been living together for about 2 months now. It will take time and plenty of effort, but I’m willing to put in the work. Sometimes it takes the world crashing in on us for us to realize what is important and what is not. Take this time to not only take care of yourself and your health, but use this time as a time for reflection. You may feel the same by the end, but at least you took the time to think about what you really want. Then again, I don’t know your situation, so whatever your decision, I will pray that you get better and healthy health wise. Take care"

We really had an amazing love and relationship, but I have BPD, and I f’d up bad. At least we are talking, slowly, but we are taking baby steps. I continue to pray that he will give me one last chance, but it doesn’t sound good, and that breaks my heart. Thanks for the continued support and advise. It helps me to remain strong, although I still feel broken. I just keep myself extremely busy, but the moment I’m alone in a room with time to breathe, I breakdown, let all of it out asking God to take the pain in my heart away. Every time I ask, I cry harder uncontrollably. But then when I have to get back to my grind, I wipe the tears, clear my voice and put my strong mask back on. I try not to have me time anymore.

Well I just recently started a new relationship and we are just now starting to discuss sex. We have been together for two months and now I’m ready and I believe he is, since it is in our conversation at least once a week. He is very respectful of my situation and of my feelings. So keep on looking because there are a few of them out there just toss the ones that talk about sex all the time to the side and tell him you have no time for their shenanigans that you need a quality man and obviously they are not one."

Divorce,fgyyk4z,t3_f0p3eb,1581188704.0,"I feel you on this. I wish you we my stbxh as well. We all make mistakes, but don’t spend the rest of your life in purgatory. There was a reason it didn’t work. And you both played a part, it is not one sided. Is it truly over or is there a chance for reconciliation? If you are already divorced, I am sorry to hear, but if you are in the process, there still might be a chance for reconciliation. In my current situation, after all the damage caused after he walked out, I cannot go back. I say this because when you need someone the most and they aren’t there, even when you are near death, if they aren’t there by your side, then there was no love. I know everyone deals with pain differently, but if your ex was in the hospital and days away from dying, wouldn’t you be there? Especially if it is within a few days or months after the separation happened? So, yeah, no going back for me, because that showed me that after two decades of marriage my stbx didn’t love me at all. So my advice would be to try and fix it or remind yourself every day that God is watching and hearing everything, he just heard and saw something both of you were blind to and decided that he needed to put a speed bump to slow you both down so you can reflect on what has happened and the parts you both played. It is up to you to let him in to help lead you down the right path. It will all work out in the end. Stay strong! You got this! We got this! We all got this!!"

After I was home for a week, I left the house with every intention to go back, giving him a little time to gather things, he locked me out, changed the locks, and told me our marriage was over through text message.

He can stay married to me, if he wants. I’m just over it. My mom told me I should f with him. I looked at her an said” now mama, you know God don’t like ugly” lol, I x’d him out and moved forward. I was also told that he finds something wrong with every woman he swipes through and he finally went on a date. But I guess that didn’t go well either.

relationship_advice,f78i1mm,t3_duv6dh,1573493484.0,"What I meant to say is, due to my disorder, I twisted things in my mind and had convinced myself that he had an affair. I do take responsibility for my actions. I know I did wrong, but I ended up driving myself into a manic depressive state as well as psychosis according to my doctors. I ended up overdosing the day he asked for a separation, but it wasn’t due to that, it was due to knowing how I did wrong and hurt him and my family. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital in the psych ward and was able to untwist my thinking. If you would like to read my post regarding everything that happened, it’s titled emotional affair and attempted suicide in the emotional affair subreddit page. It will give you a more thorough explanation of what led me down this destructive path. Thank you for your input. I appreciate and value your words of wisdom. I do take full responsibility in my part."
relationship_advice,f78f7m2,t1_f78emay,1573492085.0,"Actually not tru. I know I’m in the wrong. I didn’t mean for it to turn into an emotional affair. It all started out with discussions about my career as a chef. I was trying to get a stage for a restaurant that I absolutely love and the chef who I admire, I told him I was happily married except having this one thing on my mind. Let me tell you also, I have borderline personality disorder and had convinced myself that they were having sex and then started to have nightmares on a nightly bases of them having sex and when they were done, they would look at me and laugh calling me a fool. This is what led to my affair. It only lasted a month and a half and then found out it was a catfish."

She has moved on and so should you. There is a saying”if you love someone and have to set them free, it it’s meant to be, she will come back, if not, it was never yours to begin with”. That’s all I got. I’m sorry you are going thru this. I wish you the best of luck. I will keep you in my prayers for your happiness.

relationship_advice,f74rhow,t3_du6fbr,1573406851.0,"I think so. If you are unhappy without them, then you should be accepting to rekindling your relationship and if both are willing, go to couples counseling to strengthen your relationship. I want my husband back and both of us are unhappy without each other, but because of what I did, he has walked away from our 22 year marriage. If you love that person, get back with them. Both of you seek individual counseling and couples counseling and all should be fine. Only time will tell. You will not only find yourself, but also find out if the relationship is worth staying in. Healing takes time"
cheating_stories,f73tfud,t1_f4gdohs,1573394960.0,"I agree with you. I have been married for 22 years and I had the emotional affair because I thought him and my ex best friend had an affair. Long story, if you want to read it, look under emotional affair community. I am hoping for a reconciliation, but know the damage that I have caused to my family and hoping that he will forgive me and let me rebuild his trust in me. I feel like some things happen, because God is testing the strength of a union he created. If we are strong enough and there is as much love between us as I thought, then he will bring us back together and make us whole as a family and as a couple. Thank you for your response. I really needed to read that"
emotionalaffair,f70ycgr,t3_dpnmx7,1573333956.0,"I had an emotional affair on my husband. I take fault in what I did, but not entirely. I have a mood disorder that makes me twist my thoughts. I twisted my thoughts so bad that it became reality. I started to have nightmares about my husband and best friend. So I entered into this emotional affair that turned out to be a catfish. Trust is something you earn. Communication is the key element to a successful relationship. My husband hates me and has said our marriage is over. We have been together for 22 years. I would sit down and have a talk with her to make sure why she did what she did. If you truly love her, you will try to build that trust again and work things out. My problem was that I did not communicate my feelings to him. Had I , we would not be here in this position that I created. I always say, give it another chance. Shame on her for once, if it happens again, end it. We all need a little understanding and forgiveness. We are human and we are allowed to make mistakes. Take time to think things over and your feelings for her. It may be worth it in the long run. Sometimes things like this can strengthen a relationship. Best of luck. I will keep you in my prayers."

Unless you both are confident about your relationship or have an open relationship, I wouldn’t.  My best friend wanted to have a threesome with me and my husband. When I told her we would talk about it when she wasn’t drinking, she immediately went to my husband and told him. They both were very persistent about it the entire time she was visiting.
