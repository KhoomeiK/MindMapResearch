Usually, when we have intense reactions to unpleasant stimuli, that may be an indication that there is a deeper-rooted problem. I'm not a psychologist, but years of therapy made me realise that we don't just break down for no reason.

In my opinion, you REALLY need to practice self-love and compassion. The better you treat yourself, the better you may start to feel. Trying to 'toughen up' will not fight the problem, just conceal it.

Your feelings are VALID, so honour them, as they serve a purpose.

Drugs,fqlix4g,t3_gjgxuc,1589459295.0,"Firstly, don't you EVER combine tramadol with any other drug. Tramadol lowers your seizure threshold. On top of that, it can interact dangerously with other substances.

If you live with your parents, maybe take it before going to bed. Some people feel nothing when taking tramadol, others do, so it is hard to say how your body will react. If you haven't taken tramadol before, 150mg is a good dose to start with. Depending on if you've eaten beforehand, it may take about an hour to start working.

When I was taking tramadol, everything was more enjoyable, so just see what works for you.

Although abuse does leave scars, they do fade with time. Sometimes it may be a long time, but they DO fade. What helps me is rationalizing my thoughts and behaviours, e.g. I am anxious because I have had bad experiences in similar situations.
