bipolar,fclluit,t1_fckycgr,1577750816.0,"Iâ€™ve been involuntarily committed as well, so no pew pew pew ðŸ”« for me either.

Meds take a while to adjust. Itâ€™s damn frustrating waiting for something to happen though.

I once used http://talkspace.com for a therapist if youâ€™re interested in a video therapist.

Keep doing what youâ€™re doing though.

Bipolarâ€™s definitely a long journey."
bipolar,fckw118,t1_fcjxptz,1577734410.0,"I had to move in with my parents when I was having mental health issues at the age of 43. In the past I had been distant with them but I grew closer while staying with them.

Youâ€™re fortunate you at least have a financially supportive family. Iâ€™m sure there are those that donâ€™t and end up on the streets,

Are you depressed and no longer interested in video games and shooting guns at the gun range? Or youâ€™ve moved passed them?

Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Have they tried to adjust your meds?"
bipolar,fcjye26,t3_ehkj9q,1577710427.0,"Wishing that youâ€™ll be able to get back on your meds.

Yeah, being Bipolar sucks ass.

Definitely feel fortunate that youâ€™ve got quite a few positives in your life.

My friend used to tell me â€˜You got thisâ€™ which I thought was annoying af. But you know what? I pulled through it thanks to meds."
bipolar,fcjw4kf,t3_ehef99,1577707608.0,"Congratulations on taking the first step in focusing on your mental health.

Are your parents supportive? Have any siblings?

What hobbies did you have in the past that brought you joy?

Iâ€™ve been in that dark hole myself, didnâ€™t think things could possibly get better, but eventually they did.

Itâ€™s a hard journey but you can pull through it.

I used to watch this video for inspiration. Itâ€™s â€˜I had a black dog, his name was depressionâ€™

Iâ€™ve struggled with depression in the past with heavy suicidal ideations. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d pull through it but I did.

Have you tried going out for a walk?"
