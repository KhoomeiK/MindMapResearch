lansing,fofwd5w,t3_g75dyw,1587743972.0,"Try calling the Mason Meijer. I was in the checkout line last Saturday morning and they had just gotten two Switch Lites delivered. Didn't even ask! The cashier was on the phone about it when I stepped up. Granted, those two Lites are probably long gone by now, but at least they're still getting shipments.

I pre-ordered a Switch bundle through GameStop near the beginning of the month, and it arrived this week. You may want to keep an eye on their site just in case they release a similar offer.

I hope this helps! Best of luck!"

TheWayWeWere,fn66tjq,t1_fn16her,1586689708.0,"I was thinking the 1930s myself, but was also considering the age of the tourist attractions. I'm kind of a Detroit history nerd. üòâ But the late 1930s could be a possibility, for sure!

I really like the look and feel of ""linens"" and didn't realize that's what they're called. Very cool!"

AskReddit,fmycquc,t3_fxv4bl,1586483142.0,"1) OMG those wreath-shaped cookies, with green and red sugar crystals on top, that came in a plastic tub. I always keep an eye out for them around the holidays, but I haven't had any luck. They *aren't* the ones that come in different shapes (bells, etc.) Those taste like sugared cardboard and are easy to find.

2) Jelly Stars (at least I think that's what they were called.) They had an annoyingly chewy center of some kind of delicious fake raspberry ""jelly."" The cookie part was rich and buttery, and had a distinct vanilla/almond flavor. They came in some sort of plastic sleeve and tray thing. No dice tracking those down, either.

Annnnnnnd now I'm hungry...and disappointed."
