Many times, she leads you through breathing practices in the course of the video and it’s essentially meditation, sometimes with and sometimes without movement, but I find it much easier than the apps or trying anything on my own."
lexapro,f06w72s,t3_d3sh3l,1568447106.0,"Oh boy, this is too real. I joke about being anxious all the time, but not sure anyone realizes I’m actually anxious. Outside of medical professionals I have only told one sympathetic coworker and no one else in my life that I’m taking lexapro, but been on it about two months and honestly, it’s been life saving. I finally feel like myself again. I’m so grateful for it."

Anxiety,esf3dzj,t3_c7g2mv,1561916132.0,"I experienced this for the first time this week. I’m usually someone who enjoys a few drinks with friends when I go out. Don’t normally go too crazy, since I’m getting older and hangovers are the wrest. But last weekend I had some wine at dinner and a couple beers after - felt fine during it, enjoyed my buzz, but the next day I felt awful. It was more than a hangover, it was feeling of anxiety. Chest tightness, shakiness, distractedness. I went to a movie and could barely sit still.I tried to tell myself it was all a hangover but upon reflection, it clearly wasn’t. Thursday, we had a party at work and I decided to drink a couple glasses of wine - it was a free party after all! Again, I felt fine, even good during it, but as the alcohol wore off, the anxiety set in. I felt fucking awful Friday. So anxious, tense, jittery and scatterbrained. I know my limits with drinking and this wasn’t due to any hangover. Then yesterday I went to the bar where my best friend works, where I’m normally super comfortable because I’m there all the time, and ordered a single beer to sip while I hung out. I drank it over the course of 2 hours, but was anxious while doing it. I think I hid my discomfort pretty well from my friends, but I feel insane for being nervous to drink one beer, when up until a week ago it was no problem for me. My birthday is in a few weeks and I was looking forward to having some fun but now I’m just worried I’ll have a panic attack in front of all my friends after having a sip of a drink. Would love to hear others advice on this!"
Anxiety,eseoy5i,t3_c7dra7,1561905649.0,"My advice would be to think about that walk you took with your dog and friends. How did you feel before and after? Even if it wasn’t perfect, were you proud, more content, were you happy that your dog was happy? I would focus on anything positive that you can think about that resulted in going out. Of course, going to bigger events can be stressful, but think about the good feelings or outcomes that can come from doing the activities. It’s also ok to not take every opportunity and focus on things that make you feel the best or are a bit more comfortable! Good luck!"
Anxiety,esdsnmd,t3_c77ck6,1561867385.0,"I have floaters and realized that I tend to really notice them when I’m feeling anxious. I have a really high eye Rx, and the eye doctor dilates me every year, so I know my eyes are perfectly healthy (floaters are totally normal especially if you have a high prescription). Usually my brain ignores them most of the day, but when I’m feeling especially anxious, I can’t stop noticing them. Don’t know if it’s my racing mind paying more attention or higher blood pressure but I just wanted to pop by and say, you’re not alone!"
Anxiety,escbneg,t1_es9tzsu,1561825720.0,Feeling sort of drunk is a great way to describe it. Probably why I’m continuing to freak out the most at work.  Hoping this weekend calms me down more. Feeling a bit better today.
Anxiety,es9rvpc,t1_es9p8xk,1561743106.0,Thanks for the reassurance! It really helps to know that I am not the only one feeling this way physically. I hope you're feeling better after your appointment. These physical symptoms are no joke!
Anxiety,es9pdk8,t3_c6l3ze,1561741473.0,"I think you should let yourself feel however it makes you feel, but also take to your boyfriend and let him know that it made you feel anxious, so the thought doesn't linger and fester. Easier said than done, I know, but it's totally valid to feel anxious about it!"
