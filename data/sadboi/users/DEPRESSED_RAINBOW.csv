Their addiction to it screwed with the lives of everyone around them, and I whole heartedly believe if they hadn't done these things neither I nor the rest of the family would be so screwed up. So because of that I shalln' t be doing drugs, but it also keeps me from wanting to do anything else like smoking and drinking. Which I guess is a good thing. But it does worry me that if I even take medication I'll get addicted, since I'm prone to it, and start abusing it. So if I ever need to take a medication for something, I'm kinda screwed."

It shaped my personality in MULTIPLE ways. Since it lead to trauma, but good trauma. Lets say... it made me more mature. Also it gave me alot of mental and not mental problems that took effected my personality (ex: ADHD, aphasia, speech problems, etc.). 
So I do believe it screwed with me, but in all it defiantly made me that way I was today. Without it I promise you I probaly wouldn't be as mature or passive. So I gotta say, I'm kinda glad they did."
