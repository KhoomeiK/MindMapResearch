I am also male, and I have a male friend, James, that does all of this with me, so this may not work in your situation.  Conversations with James have led me to some interesting self-reflection that I have found intriguing and I hope is expressed in a useful fashion here:

I would suggest that you just be a person she can talk to, about anything she wants, and that engages with her regularly. What I mean is that you need to take on the 'nosy extrovert' persona that starts the conversation with a short message or specific question (about her, or something she is interested in at that exact moment), because she won't, because she doesn't see the value.  That's not to say it doesn't have value, she just doesn't see it (I sure didn't for a long time).  

Keep in mind that emotional language may be a stumbling block, so questions like ""how are you?"" are generally not productive. For instance, note I wrote an entire paragraph above about my friend James, who is obviously very important to me, and there isn't a single emotional word in that paragraph.  Or this one, for that matter. Thankfully, this means you can usually forego conversational niceties with aspies and get right to the point. 

If she engages, keep asking leading questions about whatever she is talking about. If she doesn't, 'leave it on Read' for a few days, and then try again. One in five attempts may get an engaged response, but the fact that you keep trying and don't just give up because she isn't reacting the way you think she 'should' is what will eventually build enough rapport to start having meaningful conversations.

AskEngineers,fmf41h0,t1_fmf1j1p,1586019499.0,"The higher production quantities is usually the justification, so I totally get that, but here's the rub: you gotta make the molds to make the parts. So there's five figures worth of cost, plus the months of time for fabrication. Plus a month or more to validate, plus more time to rework the molds.

And *then* you can make them fast and cheap and amortize the cost of $25k molds across 1M units.

...that's all time and resources that you could be printing and tweaking your design to get better performance (be that ruggedness, shorter print time, less material, etc).  

I had a faceshield design come across my inbox last week that weighed eight grams.  That's 16 cents worth of material and 23 minutes to print. If I did nothing to make it better, that's 250 units a month (including maintenance downtime) off of a machine that costs $300.

That means I could take your mold money today, buy 125 kilos of material and 75 printers and have over 15,000 shields for you by... The end of May. And then another 18,000 to 20,000 for you every month after that.   

Or you could have zero shields and a five figure PO for molds at the end of May, be molding by the end of June and ramp production to 100,000 units per month in July.

So, come August 1st, you're ahead by 55,000 units. 

The big question: can you really wait until August?
_______

Specifically on the IM design: you have multiple pulls, thin walls, and high aspect ratio surfaces. Have you thermally modeled this to see what shape the mold needs to be so that this is the shape of your final part once the shot cools?  If not, that's NRE you'll be charged for by the die shop.

There's a long discussion and trade study to be had between molding and printing that I won't retype here, try Google.

What I will say independently of the economics, is that designs are always optimized relative to their fabrication method. You can't effectively or efficiently take a 3D print design and injection mold it, much in the same way that you can't take the CAD for a CNC part and 'just' print it and expect a similar part. 

Thermoforming *might* be a better choice due to all the thin cross-sections and limited load conditions.  Maybe.  Or... You could derive a design from other inejction molded parts, instead of printed parts and save yourself a massive amount of time and effort, assuming you have the SCM in place for injection molding."

Just pipe your gcode output through [GPX](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:81425) and it'll convert it for you.

Or, build an OctoPi server and install the GPX plugin to have it done automatically when you upload your gcode (and reap all the other benefits of [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org) )

Otherwise, pay $150 for [Simplify3D](https://www.simplify3d.com/) and it'll do it without the extra step. 

(I had a ""fix all these broken MakerBots (Rep2/2x) and you can keep two as payment"" deal with a service bureau a few years back, and one of the ones I kept had Sailfish firmware installed on it, which is what got me interested in working around MakerBot corporate BS)"

Now it's more of a scan/sweep. While thinking about the memory and visualizing it, close eyes, sweep left, hold for a moment at the limit, sweep right, hold for moment at the limit, keep eyes closed, repeat a few times. 

The device that EMDR researchers use is a bar of LEDs a couple of feet long that you watch sweep back and forth. Seeing one of those in person was what gave me the idea to slow down the eye movement rate.

I have yet to decide whether I want to consider it aversion therapy or meditation... Either way it has been a useful tool."

And it's the *only* thing that ever helped.  There's cringey memories that I can remember having bad reactions to that no longer even register a response."
