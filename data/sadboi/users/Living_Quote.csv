I really want to do well for myself in life and I fear that if I do nothing, I might miss out on them. How do I fulfil these ambitions while at the same time bieng detached."
Advice,fq4pibp,t3_gfxilc,1589081177.0,"Talk to a conselour at your school and figure our what you can do. These are abusive parents and you need to get away from them as soon as you can. They are also not giving you the care you deserve. Tinned food and t.v dinners are not really the best foods to eat for your condition. Report them to CPS or something else. Whatever happens, do not let this abuse continue."

Also, find a way to get legal custody of your daughter too. You seem like a good man so do not let her keep your daughter."
