GameDeals,fn2grnr,t3_fyk3tn,1586588444.0,"The whole game can be summed up as atmospheric hack n slash with permadeath. Apart from basic controls, it does not guide you by hand and you have to figure out yourself where to go, where to find keys needed for unlocking doors to the next floor, how to unlock shortcuts. There's also crafting, which you also have to figure out yourself.

In the difficulty department, game can be pretty brutal. As I said, the game features permadeath. If your character dies on any floor, you start over at the beginning of the game and you lose all the items you collected, including the ones needed to progress and you have to find your character's body in order to retrieve these items. This can become very frustrating, if you hate backtracking, even though you can unlock shortcuts to cut time on exploring the floors again.

There are two game modes - Survival and Explore mode. In Survival, you have to maintain your character's needs such as hunger, thirst and temperature and traps can kill you instantly. 
The Explore mode was added in the newest update  and is basically what I'd call an easy mode - you don't have to worry about the needs (except the temperature) and the combat and traps are more forgiving.

The audiovisual aspect is pretty great - rain pouring down, cave echoes, enemies noises. I loved sitting by the campfire and listening to Jim Guthrie's theme that is played.

In overall, if you don't mind dying and backtracking a lot and losing lots of progress to a spike pit, it's worth getting. However, there's no story as far as I'm concerned, the game focuses mostly on exploration and the ending leaves a bad taste."
