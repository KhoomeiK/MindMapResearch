My parents dog was abused prior to them adopting her and she lays in the corner of the couch and doesn't move all day except to go outside because she feels safe there I would guess that your dog feels safe on the couch and other places worry her.

The eating and drinking quickly leads me to believe she had to fight for food and has not gotten past that. She may never.

It sounds like she does not have a lot of trust in you because of the growling at least until she realizes who you are when you get closer.

She may have sustained an injury to her back at the hand of people and doesn't trust humans not to hurt her.

Dogs just like people can suffer from mental illnesses and it sounds like she may have PTSD

also he should be fine from drinking out of the puddle but just watch him for diarrhea or vomiting or any sort of unusual/worrying behavior because he could have gotten a parasite

A trainer would help a lot but you don't need one if you have the patience and time to do it yourself - your parents will have to help too it can't just be you or the training won't translate between people you could get him completely walk trained when you're around but if your parents don't do it too he will learn what he can get away with with them and that could be dangerous to his health especially if he chases cars"

DogAdvice,fl7rvep,t3_fn4372,1584908052.0,"What you can do is have a routine where cuddle time is allowed and times where it is not. Let's say you sit on the couch in the morning and watch the news before going to work where cuddles are acceptable but maybe after work you want to sit on the couch and relax without a puppy. You need to be firm and consistent with this routine and eventually your pup will learn when you want him around. Puppies require a lot more attention than adult dogs so Flynn will crave more attention than he would if he were 2+ years old. One thing you have to know is whatever behavior you allow now he will continue to do as an adult and it can be difficult to break him of that.

So try to find a routine that is mutually beneficial"
