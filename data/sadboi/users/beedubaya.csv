> Did they though? Fully and irreversibly? Honest question.

That's a difficult question.  It's possible.  COVID-19 has created a world that feels very apocalyptic and where nothing is certain. Donald Trump is POTUS and the Christian Right is very powerful in our society right now.  I'll feel a lot better once we get passed this dreadful era in our collective experience.

>I love them, and it sucked growing up yearning for reality and inner peace in an environment that thrives on sheer obedience. But...the only thing my parents took from me was support during a small part of my life. I wish I didn't have to wait until 29 to look them dead in the face and move on from the silly charade I built to satisfy their shitty church culture. But it happened the way it did for a reason, and at least I got the chance to stand up to them at all.

That's great that you have that attitude and glad you got out before 30!  Hopefully they eventually do come around.  One thing that sucks so much about fundamentalism is how hard they push their members to place the faith and the rules over their own family members.  A lot of it has to do with image and the fact fundamentalism places so much emphasis on appearances.  For my parents, a lot of what they did had to do with my dad not wanting to be judged by his church members for having a gay son, especially since he was an assistant pastor.  He actually went through a crisis believing that he couldn't even preach anymore after I came out the first time.

One of the most painful things for me is that I didn't get to experience this during the last decade.  I was deep in the evangelical Christian world when the marriage equality decision happened.  In fact, it was the hatred and non-stop venom that everyone was spewing after the decision that caused me to stop going to church (I became atheist a few years later).

My homphobic parents pretty much destroyed my life and in light of COVID-19, I'm not sure I'll get another chance.  Things would have turned out very differently had I stood up to them but they convinced me that if I loved them, I would do what it took to make them happy."
