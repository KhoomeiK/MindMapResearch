Google your local Academy Trust. Download their Company Accounts from Companies House.

In our area, the leaders in our Academy Trust are paid £80-135K and up to £20k pension contributions per year.  More in pension contributions than some staff salaries.

They are direct agents of the Department for Education, DfE.

I'm not saying they're doing it for money.

I am saying that they will not suffer as a result of this pandemic. They live in large suburban houses, don't have to mingle with plague kids - staff do that.

It's not the leaders of businesses (Tory politicians are business people on the side) who are dying. It is the staff and clients of these businesses.

I'd rather my kids got ""left behind"" for a year than died, or had lung damage from COVID19.


What is wrong with some of you? 

The government is spending billions on its foreign killing machine , and has done for ever. Just spend that on defending British people directly.

Borrowing has never been cheaper.
