I can assure you that I know what you've described already. I own a Saab 9-3 Aero with a B284 V6 Turbo currently running 12psi, soon to be tuned to 20psi, at I believe 9.5:1 compression if memory serves correct. So it is necessary for me to run 91 as you can imagine, not just because the label says ""premium"" and the number is higher. I am not having pre detonation issues, I was just curious to see if we even had 93 in Lincoln. I currently run VPower 91 in the car, and that serves it just fine. The point of the whole post was really to prove to the Saab people in New England that 93 practically doesnt exist here in Lincoln."
