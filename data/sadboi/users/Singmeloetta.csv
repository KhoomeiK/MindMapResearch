AskReddit,fkz4fkq,t3_fksy04,1584662553.0,"The summer before my father passed away, I was staying at a sleep-away camp (meant for kids with autism and other similar disorders.) Every day I would have a massive panic attack, crying myself to the point of sickness, and considering suicide because I couldn't take the anxiety of my father getting into a car accident and not being there to know about it. I begged them to let me talk to him, but they never relented. About 4 months later to the day, he passed away in a fatal car crash which we still don't know the exact details of.  


A few days before my dad passed away, my mom was relaxing in bed and watching my father sleep. The odd thing was, he was sleeping with his hands crossed over his chest, as if though he were lying in a casket. According to her, the clock on their nightstand said 9:11 at the exact time she checked on him. They never talked about it again, but my mother said she thinks about it ever so often and chills go up her spine.

The start of it all is the scariest part, when you know something is wrong but you don't know exactly what it is.  


As for the images, unfortunately, they don't go away, at least not without a ton of meds and therapy. What my therapist likes me to do is try and replace the image of my dad with something relaxing, like a beach. If you need to be with someone else, go be with that person and just...talk or do something you like to do.

AskReddit,eq492ek,t3_bwz545,1559771897.0," My middle school French teacher, Mme Kraft. She was a bad teacher in general, going off on tangents about her six-toed cat, just giving us the work instead of actually teaching it (mind you, this was most people's first or second year of French) and just other crappy things in general. Most people were lucky if they passed her class at all.

One incident I remember in particular, goes something like this: It was presentation day, and I have High Functioning Autism (not a fan of presentation because they involve a lot of public speaking and eye contact), so with my IEP the school had agreed to let me handle presentations the way I wanted; either give me more time to prepare or have me do it after class with just a teacher in the room.

Anyway, when she gets to my name, I tell her ""Sorry Madame, I really can't do this right now. I'll do it after class, if you want."" And then Madame Kraft Mac-and-Cheese goes nuts, rushing my desk and screaming into my ear ""You're never going to get anywhere like that, now get up here and do your damn presentation!"" Now, for reasons I can't remember, I was already on the verge of a sensory overload that day, so I started crying out of fear. All I could do was say ""I'm trying, I'm trying."" over and over.

She then said, ""Well you're not trying hard enough! Because of your distraction, we're now off schedule for presentations."" Knowing that I could never ask her to go see the nurse or the counselor, I put my head down on my desk and blacked out for the next 30 minutes or so until the bell ring.
