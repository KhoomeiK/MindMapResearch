I guess for men I was trying to act submissive because I felt uncomfortable with being dominant in a relationship. 

I'm only recently exploring my repressed attraction to men, so my only experience regarding that dynamic is through the lens of dominant and submissive binary.

When I frame it as being equal in a relationship I feel much more comfortable and the attraction feels more simliar to what I feel towards women.

logh,flvkb5a,t3_frf0ah,1585525686.0,"Assuming Julian, he probably wouldn't play it too smart. I can see him being overtaken by emotion when seeing Yang again, and he'll probably tell Yang a summary of the events. That might cause a divergence from the original timeline that results in a series of completely different events. 

Though, Yang will have an upper hand throughout the series. For example, he knows how to capture/defend Iserlohn, he knows Lohenngram's aspirations, etc. 

If Julian played it smart though, I think he would've left events to progress normally until around episode 10 where he attempts to convince Yang that he knows the future. 

Thereafter, he and Yang will probably try to stop the high council from voting to over extend their forces into the Empire's territory (episode 12). Around that time in the story it was well known that the Free Planet Alliance had leverage over the Empire that could be used to bargain for a peace treaty. 

That would instantly save probably over 10 million lives, the conquering of the Free Planets Alliance, and allow for prolonged peace. The Goldenbaum dynasty would not be aggressive or violate the treaty as they would have a coup to worry about within 10 episodes or so. 

This attempted coup would likely cause a prolonged civil war rather than a swift takeover. Furthermore, Lohenngram wouldn't have political leverage from repelling the Free Planets Alliance campaign and might not successfully overthrow the goldenbaum dynasty. 

So the end result would be a strong Free Planets Alliance, a fractured empire, and a possibly lasting peace. Sounds like a good time to retire."

Realizing you aren't comfortable with your body and that you should've transitioned earlier is extremely painful reality. It's like a terrible symphony of regret, discomfort, and grief.

Thankfully it gets better as transitioning continues on, and I live a much better life than I did previously.

AskReddit,flmjq6l,t1_fll283f,1585285698.0,"I agree, though thankfully for the internet civil activism,  communication, and idea dissemination has been drastically increasing all over the world.

Many countries are having silent revolutions as western ideas spread among the populace as the world becomes more connected. 

However, in the United States this interconnectivity is allowing political ideologies to be spread just as fast. The current president has fundamentally changed the Republican party by appealing to populism and communicating directly to the Republican voter base. 

By influencing the voter base with new ideas and sentiment he immediately changed the ideology and behavior of his party members. As each party member was accountable to the voter base that he directly influenced. 

This effectively killed the Republican establishment within a single election cycle as all elected representatives needed to adapt to a new populist voter base.

This caused a huge change in power between the President and congress. Since the President was the center of a new Republican ideology, going aganist him was equivalent of political suicide as it would anger their constituents.

This allowed for him to get away with most of what he's done within the last couple years. Scandal after scandal didn't effect him because he became an embodiment of the party's ideology. 

Now all bets are off in terms of checks and balances. From now on if any single person wants to control the government with drastically reduced restraint all they have to do is control the ideology of their party.

Which is nothing new in terms of politics, but now it's so much easier. 

As long as these scandals remain within article headlines and everyone is distracted from the consequences of these actions then anything goes. 

All that we can hope for from now on is that the consequences get so great its enough for people to hold elected officials accountable for the culmination of their actions. 

In a way the coronavirus in the United States might cause such an undeniable disaster that the populist fervor will be replaced by thinly veiled cynicism. Which I suppose is healthier than the alternative."

Funerals are for the living, and are the beginning part of the healing process for the deceased's loved ones. They do have a place in our society, and we need them to heal.

However, why don't we have a ceremony for the living in conjugation with funeral?

Why don't we have, as death approaches for the dying, one last ceremony? One last celebration and showcase of love for the dying's life and what they gave to everyone.

If other animals had half the power we do there is no doubt they would be just as bad to the environment as we are. 

This being said, that doesn't change the fact we are slowly destroying the environment around us. A lot of animals are losing their lives and suffering because of our ignorance and negligence. I feel most people when they compare humans to animals are trying to make the point on how *bad* we are not how *good* animals are.

We cause extinctions without even trying, we can obliterate environments in under a year, and millions of animals die painful deaths as we carelessly pollute. 

As of right now in this moment around the world thousands of fish are choking to death despite being underwater. 

Within the span of a couple years millions of animals die of starvation as their environment is obliterated, many of which have offspring that die before the parents do. 

Members of endangered species face crippling loneliness as they struggle to find mates, and eventually die alone.

Do you know how you feel pain? Can you imagine your children dying in front of you? Can you imagine slowly choking as the air around you has less and less oxygen? Or what about starving to death in a cold lonely night?

Pain, sadness, loneliness - all the emotions you feel, they feel too. The only difference is they can't comprehend what caused their suffering or have the power to fix it.

Animals aren't better than us. The truth is, they're a lot like us and we are a lot like them. The point is that we actually have the power to stop our suffering and their suffering.

We don't though because of our ignorance. All this suffering exists outside of our environment and invisible to everyone. No one sees fish choking to death, animals mourning over their dead children, or animals dying painfully alone.

There's always two degrees of separation between us and that suffering. Until people see the pain we cause public opinion will remain where it is.

I walked in small circles in the hospital hallway til I was discharged at 4 AM. I went home and squirmed til I burnt out at 7 AM."

AskReddit,f44uk45,t3_djabmx,1571359132.0,"I don't drink because I have bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder are prone to addiction, and I know if I begin drinking I wouldn't be able to stop.

It took me a year to become mentally and emotionally stable **without** having to deal with addiction. My friends and family like who I've turned into, and I'm not risking that to get buzzed."
bipolar,eys9jdh,t3_cyaiaa,1567391115.0,This medication actually worked really well for me. It's so strange to read all the negative experiences on here. I don't have episodes anymore or noticable cycling. The side effects were annoying but went away after awhile.
insaneparents,eyrlca9,t1_eyq66a8,1567371602.0,"Knowing your mother it is a real possibility that if she knows the surivllence camera is gone she might buy a more discrete camera to monitor you. Head over to Amazon and search for spy cameras. There are many extremely discrete alternatives than a surivllence camera. I think you need to level with her a little more to reinforce monitoring you isn't okay. 

If she seems to be not responding to the conversation or reluctant to concede then you should change your approach to render the camera seemingly operable but functionally inoperable. It's better to at least know how you're being monitored and have the power to tinker with it than not knowing. 

I would also suggest buying a RF signal detector to detect any hidden cameras just in case. Those things are usually $50 and detects hidden cameras that use wifi and bluetooth. I doubt your mother would invest in a hidden camera that only functions without wifi/bluetooth. 

Anyway hope things go okay for you. This invasion of privacy is ridiculous and no individual should experience it."
blackmirror,ew3ca8r,t3_cm1rh6,1565072107.0,There's no shame in getting professional health if you feel this way. You may or may not have some sort of disorder. If you think you notice a pattern that extends beyond this mental episode then get it checked out.

ElectricalEngineering,erwfc5v,t3_c48xay,1561341949.0,"Amazing project from one electrical engineering to another. Though this  video gave me an idea and I think you're probably the best person to  give to:

I think it would be cool to write a full on program in minecraft. Imagine this:

1. Have a minecart get pushed down a rail-line at a slow pace.
2. At every X amount of rail-lines place a minecart detector.
3. On each minecart detector have 8 lines of redstone dust connect to the  orange address redstone dust on your memory. Then also connect two lines  of redstone dust to the 1 and 0 redstone dust on your memory. That is a  total of 10 connections for \*each\* minecart detector.
4. Then break  some of those 10 connections in such a way that for each specific  minecart detector it selects a certain address and writes a 1 or a 0.
5. That way when you have a minecart go down this rail-line, once it  passes over a minecart detector it activates the hard coded redstone  dust and writes a 1 or a 0 to the memory which can then appear on the  display. It then goes onto to the next minecart detector which writes a 1  or a 0 to a different hard coded address and so on and so on
6. Congrats you just created a legitimate program in minecraft along with a display that actually works.
7. Due to client side lag I think the best you can hope for is to create a  ball that bounces across a display. No physics just hard coded  redstone.
8. Alternatively you can reduce the size of your memory  and your display in the hopes you can make it smaller and thus reduce  lag. I think this will allow you to have a much faster program, but then  again I never built anything like this in minecraft.

If you want a dynamic program that responds to input I think you have to combine this with a working binary calculator that can read along with write, though then again that's complicated and will probably have a bit of lag. Though if you decide to do it hit me up, I would love to design something like that. A turing complete redstone build would be legendary.

Also  some constructive criticism. I think you're rambling a lot and not  making much sense in the video. I like the tone and the editing, but I  think if you approached it from a more relaxed angle it would come  across as more genuine and enjoyable. This deserves a lot more views  considering the complexity and scope of this project, don't stop doing  what you're doing.  


EDIT: I actually just realized you can literally create an etch-sketch in minecraft if you include a binary calculator and decrease the size of your display. That sounds like a cool video."

Those who are mad about it are a very small minority.
