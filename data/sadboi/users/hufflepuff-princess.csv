One time someone wanted a Philly split (we already cut it in half to serve so it would have just meant putting it on two plates) and they wanted one half to not have onions. The server asked me first if it was okay because that's how we work for mods that are a bit odd and I said okay bc we were like 20 minutes into service and not busy but MAN did I hear that. I guess the combo of a split plate and missing ingredients was too much for one man to handle. 

Also there was one time some staff from a different department came in and wanted a side of cream cheese on their Philly and that was too much for him to handle too cause ""dinner doesn't have cream cheese on the line and I'm not grabbing any"" and he threw another fit. Few days later he came in for lunch on his day off while I was working lunch line and I sent out a side of cream cheese with his meal. He wasn't amused at all but it was fun for me."
