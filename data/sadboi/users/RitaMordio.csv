BeeSwarmSimulator,f5iunal,t3_dnza26,1572218200.0,"This was me last night, but I chose Photon. Really depends on what you need. From what I know, Gummy's small splatter gets bigger, but the big one stays the same(can someone with a gifted gummy confirm?). That could be 'goo'd if you still have a lot of goo to collect. Photon's beams are immediately converted to honey, which is great because idk about you, but I always get the beam token when I am full or about full, and see like a thousand messages pop up that I am full of pollen. Also that means you have more room in your container to hold pollen from other bees and tools. So do you need better goo, or do you want less trips to convert/slight increase of honey since every beam counts now."
BeeSwarmSimulator,f3yhwqz,t3_dit2sa,1571254257.0,"Crimson and Cobalt are great to get at the same time. They have a red/white and blue/white bomb tokens that collects from both colors. So with a red/white activated, red bombs can collect from white as well. And then with the blue/white added to that, red bombs can collect from blue flowers, and blue bombs from red. Festive Bee is great to have for the random gift drops. Tabby bee is better to get early on as it gets stronger the more tabby love tokens you get (this was actually my last bee, but my wife's first.) And Puppy bee, I wouldn't suggest until later, the bond tokens are frequent, but the fetch combo is pretty difficult to keep up with especially if you are trying to collect tokens, and keep up with haste. Sometimes the ball is hard to see or it is too fast for either of you to catch. You could stand still, but it's really not worth doing that."

That's the only thing I can think of as to why she is upset. He sounds like he is gonna take advantage of a gullible girl. Good on you for calling, this could stop a worse situation.
