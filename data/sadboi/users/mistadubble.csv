I am very sympathetic to your situation, as I have personally been there several times throughout my life; but, you just have to accept the situation you are in, unfortunately.

You will not start to heal or move forward until you truly let go. Trying to keep each other in the proximity of one another will just delay the inevitable.

Your concern is validated and very real. 

I sort of relate to you with this issue, as I have issues with appearance, too. However, when we identify issues, especially those that we feel we cannot correct or change, we begin creating these mental traps that leave us feeling hopeless. When we become hopeless we give up on changing or improving our situation, which is more of a detriment to our overall health than the problem itself.

I am not very knowledgeable of the Quran, so feel free to correct me if I am wrong; but, in the Bible, I do not think anywhere in the scriptures does it state that your sins will be made known to you. During judgment, you more or less will just be denied entry and be sent to hell. I am not sure if you ever will know why specifically you are sent to hell, except you assume you have sinned that wasn't forgiven. 

> Yes sorry there might been a misunderstanding, allow me correct it: God created people with the potential of good and evil. Created heaven and hell for the purpose of those whose actions are good in heaven and those whose is evil in hell. This is to demonstrates to the rest of creation and the dweller of hell and heaven on what is Good and evil define by God.

Why should they understand the *why* of how they ended up in hell? Hell is not a place of rehabilitation, it's an eternal sentence handed to those who sin. It's far too late to learn anything once you are dead.

> Just like in a society it’s not bad to put people in jail for their action. Dwellers of hell are exactly where they belong because of their own actions.

The idea of jail is to rehabilitate inmates to reduce their recidivism so that they become a contributing member of society. Equating the function of hell to jail is inaccurate to put it mildly.

> The creation wasn’t created bad they chose to be bad, there is difference.

This is not what you proposed earlier.

We should all agree that he should not blame himself for the suicide, but he mustn't ignore that he did play a part to it. Though he isn't solely to blame, he undoubtedly contributed to her suicide.
