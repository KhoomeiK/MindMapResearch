astrologymemes,fq38tfn,t1_fpumotu,1589064075.0,">Venus is retrograding on the 13th, the first venus retrograde since that  monster venus retrograde in scorpio in 2018. so yeah, it could  definitely be bringing up that scorpionic cycle again (even though the venus retro is in gemini, but I believe this scorpio full moon is echoing that 2018 retrograde energy).  
>  
>From your placements I would guess that you are very psychic, and certainly when it comes to love with your 7th house scorpio venus and cusp. So probably if you are thinking about him a lot then he could very, very likely be thinking of you. he'll be feeling this full moon strongly as well, because of his scorpio placements, so theres a very good chance he's affected by it too. I do think one problem with scorpio mars is it can be hard for them to forgive once wronged.  
>  
>But anyway... one thing to remember is this moon and the venus retrograde will be over eventually, and then you wont be feeling it as strongly. so just stay strong, and keep in mind that there is a light at the end of the tunnel regardless!

I could feel when he entered the room or was thinking of me.

I was feeling that he would come back, but now I'm thinking otherwise. I think that he's not thinking about me anymore. Nowadays I'm so moody, I don't trust myself. Actually I'm a quiet grounded person with my Scorpio placements, Taurus rising and Saturn aspects, but this full moon highly affected me. I know this will pass, just don't want the process to be long. Because of the upcoming Venus Retrograde I'm kind of scared that I won't be able to get out of this sad and pessimistic mood soon.

&#x200B;

>I personally generally stay away from Scorpio Mars, although I love scorpio placements, because I think it has the potential to get really dark and out of control.

I know what you mean, but I'm not scared of his Scorpio Mars. *I am* the Scorpio dominant here haha :)

Also, my Venus is in conjunction with his Mars...

&#x200B;

>But... the heart wants what it wants, so if he does come back, I say do  whatever YOU want... whatever will give you what you need. If it were me I would demand a long talk where he discusses his feelings/why he acted the way he did, so you can try to get some answers/closure. If he's willing to be honest and apologize and admit to what he did wrong, and come clean about his motivations and reasons, then you can decide for yourself if you want to move forward with it. You have a lot of scorpio so it shouldnt be too hard for you to sense if he's bullshitting you or really being honest and coming clean. But I would personally need that before I went forward with trying a relationship again. It could be that getting that talk will help you move on from the feelings of hurt and disappointment. If you're really having trouble with moving on from that you could PM me and I can give you advice about different spiritual methods to sever spiritual ties and bonds to someone. It's just good to be totally certain before you do that, which is why the talk might help

Absolutely right.

Maybe he will come back, but I think it wouldn't be right to forgive him. The trust is gone. And he disrespected me. I can't forgive that.

Thank you so much!"
astrologymemes,fpsga2c,t1_fpq2e5j,1588872970.0,"Thinking of an ex a lot, yes. We broke up in the last Venus Retrograde in 2018. He misunderstood me several times and thought I was rejecting him and I tried, but couldn't explain myself. Very odd situation. I went to him to talk again and explain myself (10 days after the Retrograde - still shadow phase?) and he told me that there is someone else in his life just to hurt me. I just smiled and said goodbye. No contact since then. He has his Sun, Mercury and Venus in Cancer and Mars and Saturn in Scorpio - very emotional, hypersensitive, impulsive, vengeful and sometimes very immature. Almost two years have passed and I'm still feeling hurt and disappointed. And he still doesn't know that I didn't reject him back then. I heard that he is dating another girl, but is not happy. I have the feeling that he will come back, but Venus Retrograde is about to start. If he does I shouldn't trust him, right? Also, I'm so angry, I think I wouldn't be able to forgive him.

I also feel super drained, unmotivated and restless."

AskAstrologers,fitlt9k,t1_fih249x,1582723741.0,"And your Jupiter in Western Astrology is in Gemini or Taurus? I don't know much about Vedic Astrology. I just read that the husband is represented by Jupiter. You can google it if you want.

Taurus is a feminine sign and Taurus men can be very calm, soft, caring, affectionate, sensual etc. I think your Ascendant and Descendant are important here. Cancer is sensitive and emotional, and usually gets along with earth signs. And with Capricorn being your Descendant you are likely to attract and/or feel attracted to earth signs like Taurus.

My Descendant is Scorpio (Taurus rising here :) ) and I don't only attract and/or feel attracted to Scorpios, but also Cancers (with Scorpio placements) or sometimes other signs with Scorpio placements.
