ptsd,f32049o,t3_deymfr,1570589470.0,"i had a pretty bad ptsd moment when i went out this weekend and i was visibly shaking all over, when my friends were checking up on me i ended up deadpanning ""i'm just not feeling my absolute best, babes"" in the flat voice i get when i'm having an attack (which in retrospect i think is fucking hilarious)

i'm also terrified to lean in to the sorrow and terror because i feel like i'll go too deep and make people uncomfortable or annoyed, like i want to be a good mentally ill person and not be inconvenient or loud about it"

SuicideWatch,f24ok26,t3_dbxlfb,1569956881.0,"I'm not sure if this will help you, but I felt like this for a long time and how I ended up deciding to live wasn't by finding meaning. It was by embracing meaninglessness and chaos, I guess? I'm alive for fun, because why not.   
By leaning into absurdism and the absolute lack of rationality in our lives, everything around me just seems sillier and yeah. The whole rat race is a farce. However, there's so many opportunities for polite and enjoyable chaos, inside and around it.    
Misery doesn't serve me, and it's not inherently more valuable than fun and nonsense, which I like. I have the gift of not needing to feel like my life has meaning, because it can't and it won't. Not many people get to have that. 

Now I still have shitty days, but I get to mess with the world in small ways that might leave people scratching their chins, or even smiling. (For one example, I've been leaving garden gnomes and toy dinosaurs around my city, with little love notes on them, as gifts for the people. Bc why fuckin not)"

The only people I touch really are the ones who are outwardly affectionate themselves, and don't feel uncomfortable about me being skittish. If I notice them noticing me being weird, the whole thing becomes so fucking unbearable.   
Even the thought of asking is so impossible to me :( but I gotta 

At least we're not alone?"
needadvice,f24lb1b,t1_f232afo,1569954881.0,"Yeah, I struggle with a lot of kinds of affection. As time goes on, physical affection (and being able to say nice things to people) is what I want to do the most, but I'm not quite there yet. They might be the kinds of affection I like? Unsure. 

Also huh! I'm not sure why but yeah, I think having a blanket or a pillow in between would help. Baby steps, plus they're already my stand-ins when I need a hug"
needadvice,f24j8bq,t1_f22ujgs,1569953394.0,"Yep, thanks to my family for really goofing my ability to function lmao   
Working on being direct and clear, setting boundaries or asking for what i was often pushes me towards a panic attack which is sweet. This doesn't feel like something I'm allowed to want yet, even if other people get to want it. I want a cuddle though so I must persist"

needadvice,f24i2e0,t1_f2309mf,1569952572.0,"Complex PTSD, on the nose! My therapist specializes in it, but  I coped for years by avoiding thinking about it in any serious way and having lots of fun to stay distracted. Now I've done plenty of thinking and talking about it, and it's like a constant cloud over my head saying that nobody will ever stay with me because I never learned how to be affectionate or how to let myself be cared for/touched kindly. 

Yadda yadda I'm a broken fucked up person who can't give people what they want, will die alone, same self loathing ad nauseum.   And to an extent it's bs, but also affection and touch is a thing that people generally like and need. Myself included. Gotta start somewhere!!!"

I know what you mean though, I'm almost okay with physical affection sometimes but I avoid it because I'm afraid that I'm gonna get upset and hurt someone's feelings or just. stumble into a trigger and be fucked up about it for a week."
