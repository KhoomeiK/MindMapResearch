AskReddit,fqbbqm1,t3_ghwd8f,1589234082.0,"I’m going to have to disagree with the comments here. Ghosting is the opposite of polite - it’s cruel, cowardly, and immature. If it’s someone you were once close to, at least send them a message to say “I feel we’ve grown apart as people and as friends and I no longer wish to continue this friendship. All the best.” Then you can block them or whatever if you feel the need. 

The slow fade, hoping they’ll “get the hint”, and outright ghosting are passive aggressive and mean. Don’t tell someone you’re busy when you just don’t like them anymore. At least not if you’re trying to be “nice.” It’s more hurtful to slowly figure out someone is avoiding you than for them to just tell you they’re done with you."

Some women who have tokophobia and still desperately wish to become biological mothers have therapy to help overcome the fear. It doesn’t sound like that’s you, though.

You seem to feel quite strongly about this, and you sound more childfree than “on the fence” about it. People will *never* stop telling you “you’ll change your mind.” It’s not up to them. It took me until I was 36 to find a doctor willing to give me a tubal ligation because of all this “you’ll change your mind” nonsense, and I was quite sure of my own decision from a very young age.

If you are indeed certain you don’t want kids, this sounds like a relationship incompatibility. It’s not something that can be compromised on.  If your boyfriend wants to start a family soon and you don’t, it’s still an incompatibility. Talk to him about it, but don’t be surprised if his response is to agree and secretly decide to “wait you out” because he thinks you’ll change your mind. People tend not to believe those who say they don’t want kids, particularly women who don’t want kids.

I’ve had relationships end over this issue myself. It sucks, but life goes on. It’s better than bringing an unwanted child into the world. Even if you try not to show it, that kid will know on some level that you resent it.

PandR,fcp28xn,t1_fckpxcv,1577848245.0,I agree with all three points!
PandR,fckp00j,t1_fckohms,1577730077.0,"Yeah, Ron’s ending didn’t bother me so much, but you’ve got a point about him ending up working for the federal government. It just doesn’t quite fit him and was more about what Leslie wanted. 

I just finished my second viewing of the series last night, so this was all still fresh in my head. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to vent about it lol."
PandR,fckfv9v,t3_ehgrx5,1577724405.0,"To me, the last season feels unnecessary and tacked on. I dislike the finale in particular, but I know I seem to be in the minority.

I always liked April, but the last season pretty much ruins her character for me. Prior to season 7, I thought April had grown up a lot while remaining true to her character. But in the last season, she just comes across as annoying and entitled. She decides she’s unhappy with her career because she’s had everything handed to her her entire adult life since she’s fortunate enough to work with people who like her. 

So now somebody should just hand her a different job that she likes more. Sure, her degree is a joke of a self-made major (Halloween Studies) and she’s unwilling to pursue any additional training or education, but she seems to feel like her dream job is somehow owed to her. I laughed when she asked if she could be museum curator. That museum is apparently volunteer run, but typically museum curators have masters degrees in Museum Studies or a related field. 

And of course, this career change works out for her anyway because her friends work so hard on her behalf to find her a new job. She puts zero effort into actually getting a new job, and she’s so self absorbed it doesn’t even occur to her that she’s making Andy give up his TV show until he’s already filming his final episode.

The finale put the nail in the coffin for April’s character for me. She doesn’t want kids, but has one anyway so she can wear crazy makeup in the delivery room and name him something silly? Okay? It drives me crazy that on TV baby=happy ending, regardless of whether a baby is something the character actually wanted.

I didn’t need to see Gary’s funeral. I didn’t need to know that Leslie’s dislike of libraries extends far beyond her hatred of librarian Tammy, to the point where she’s ungrateful to have the university library named after her. I didn’t need to know that Tom failed at everything he ever tried and then made a new career capitalizing on his own failure. I didn’t need to know that Donna decided to get married and move to Seattle. I just. Don’t. Care.

I’m not a fan of finales that jump forward in time in general, though. I fall in love with a show because I like the characters and their interactions/adventures/whatever. I’d like to imagine them continuing to have the adventures I enjoy watching in the situation that drew them together. I don’t care about watching them split up, do different things, age, have babies, and die."

MakingIt_Show,fc9kj16,t3_egkzz0,1577554021.0,"I thought Justine should have gone home earlier in the show, maybe when they sent Eagan off instead of him.  But of the three finalists, she was the one I wanted to win. 

Jessie always did some amazing work, but most of it looked more like it belonged in an art installation than on a crafting competition. I actually found an interview with her where she said she wasn’t sure about applying for the show because she wants to be more artistic than crafty. I think she should have stuck with that thought. 

Lilly’s party was really cute for a kid, but I was never particularly impressed with how everything she did had to revolve around balloons. I know that’s her business, but the other contestants generally seemed to be more flexible in their ability to work with different materials. On a personal level, I got annoyed with her constant crying about missing her family. I don’t think filming the show really takes all that long.

Not all of Justine’s work throughout the show wowed me, but I liked her party theme the best, and I’m glad she won."

unpopularopinion,fbwowuc,t3_eeosoe,1577155552.0,"I had one interviewer *yell at me* because she didn’t like the BS diplomatic response I gave her.

“Why are you leaving your current position?”

“Well, I got into this field because I like helping people, and I’ve fallen into a highly technical subspecialty that’s pretty far removed from what I’d set out to do. It’s not as rewarding and I’d like to get into a more public-facing position.”

“THAT’S NOT THE REAL ANSWER! TELL ME THE REAL ANSWER!!”

My response is paraphrased, but that is a verbatim quote from the interviewer. I almost walked out. It was the most uncomfortable interview of my life."
LushCosmetics,fbbjlw5,t1_fbbjdl4,1576701815.0,No problem. I researched pretty deeply into it before I tried to remove mine because I’d heard the same thing haha.
