TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fq64a3h,t1_fq60i99,1589124195.0,"It‚Äôs okay mamas, that means we found the soft spot. You are still healing and it takes sooo much time and effort. Never give up! You will heal when the timing is right, just keep working on yourself. Try to find the line between sorting through emotions and dwelling on them. It‚Äôs a very thin line.


I came out of an 8 year relationship, helped my mangy ex get on his feet in the city, and he STILL cheated on me after treating me badly for a few months. It fucked me up for an entire year. Lots of crying and wondering what‚Äôs wrong with me (and grossly enough, going back to him for more attention ü§Æ) If anyone else is reading this: DO NOT GO BACK TO SOMEONE WHO TREATS YOU BADLY. It‚Äôs not worth it and it makes the healing time even longer. 


One day it just clicked, I finally realized that I could create my own life and happiness and that being sad about my ex bf would do nothing to further my life. I stopped being sad about that which had no benefit to me. I realized he did not add ANY value to my life and therefore was not worthy of my time or energy. 


This realization came after I worked on my confidence and self esteem. I built my value and understood that I am worthy of a better relationship and a better life in general. I realized that I AM beautiful - inside and out, intelligent, and kind. That any man would be blessed to have me and at a huge loss if they left me. I took back my power. Now, I am strong and unstoppable, yet very in touch w my femininity. I am so focused on my present and future that I feel less inclined to cry about the past. I am extremely grateful for my life, health, and growth. I may have scars, but I am Whole and I am Enough. 


Do I still occasionally feel a twinge of blue emotions when a memory pops up? Sometimes, I‚Äôm human after all. I choose not to give those memories a lot of power. I acknowledge the blue emotion and let it pass as quickly as it came. Is every day sunshine and rainbows? Nope! In fact, everyday is a battle. A battle that I look forward to. 


Anyway, my apologies if this got long üòÖ how I managed to cope may seem strange or even over the top, but it‚Äôs what worked for me. I hope things get better for you very soon! You got this! 


Some stuff to watch: Becoming by Michelle Obama on Netflix and this video I came across the other day.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fq6045g,t3_gh11p8,1589121655.0,"If a man jumps from one relationship to the next, not only was he not invested in the relationship with you, but he won‚Äôt be invested in this next one either. People who jump from relationship to relationship like that are running from something within themselves. They are not dating to truly love, they are dating to escape. 


The fact that he moved on so quickly says nothing about you and everything about him. He is clearly inconsiderate, selfish, and dishonest (hate to say it, but he‚Äôs probably been talking to that lady a lot longer than hes letting on). You are MUCH better off without this type of man in your life. It‚Äôs may hurt for awhile, but when you start examining yourself, you will learn that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. You did nothing to deserve this sort of thing. 


Honestly, sometimes the trash takes itself out. Learning to be grateful for the people who voluntarily leave our lives is right on the other side of pain/sadness. Fully feel your emotions and examine them without judgment. Be gentle with yourself. After you understand and are aware of your emotions, you can begin the healing process. Focus on building your confidence, focus on what makes you feel happy, healthy, and alive. Know that you are THE CATCH. Know that you are worthy of a loving, supportive, and fulfilling relationship. 


I‚Äôm not selling fairy tales here. There are high quality men that exist and will treat you the way you want to be treated. I‚Äôve seen so many uplifting stories on Reddit (and IRL) about women who go from toxic relationships to really healthy ones - relationships where they don‚Äôt feel neglected, doubtful, worried, unloved or anxious everyday. Brighter days are ahead for you, love üíñ just do your best and let everything else fall into place."
dating_advice,fpxl8u0,t3_gg40fk,1588984699.0,"More than likely, she‚Äôs really and truly enjoyed her time with you. However, as she said, she has to focus on getting a job right now. My guess is: there‚Äôs a lot more than a job on her mind and she needs space for a little bit. Like someone else said, I wouldn‚Äôt text her. If she‚Äôs truly busy, a text conversation may be exhausting to her right now. 


On the otherhand, I think sparingly sending her sweet texts that don‚Äôt spur on an entire conversation would be okay. Things like ‚Äúhope your job search is going great!‚Äù or ‚Äújust thinking about you‚Äù or sending her pics of stuff she likes. Again, this is not something you should do frequently. Maybe once or twice a week. 


This is advice is given from a standpoint of personal experience. I‚Äôll meet a guy I really like spending time with, but texting back all day just makes me anxious - especially if I‚Äôm already stressed out. Some women don‚Äôt want to admit or give the impression that they are emotional or sad, so they might tell a guy hey I‚Äôm busy when really they just need time to think."
relationships,fpwvm09,t3_gfzf3j,1588970789.0,"Let me tell you a little story. I had an ex boyfriend and knew for sure he thought one of my friends was pretty. In fact, one of the very first times we had sex, he drunkenly said my friends name instead of mine. (No, I wasn‚Äôt smart enough to dump him at the time. Was still very young and naive). Fast forward a few years, he got the opportunity to fuck my friend and took it. 


This is different from your situation, but it also caused me pain and worry. I really honestly tried to forgive him after we talked about it. It got to the point where I didn‚Äôt ever want to have girlfriends over because I was concerned he would try or think about fucking them. I didn‚Äôt even want to introduce him to my girlfriends. I started worrying if something was wrong with me, If I was overreacting or if I was being weak. The resentment I felt towards him became too heavy to bare. He started doing other toxic things and didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with it. It‚Äôs like he thought, ‚Äúwell she forgave me for this so let‚Äôs see how far I can take it!‚Äù 


To me, men who masturbate to their girlfriends friends pictures lack a sense of morality and may engage in other behaviors that he enjoys at your emotional expense. This does not seem conducive to a healthy and happy relationship. 


Is this a person you want to marry? Would you be proud of having this person as your husband? Do you worry he might masturbate to her pics again? Does he even feel genuinely bad for what he did? Does he see what he did as no big deal? These are questions to get started. Most people would say dump him, but if you feel like the relationship is worth saving then give it a try. I‚Äôd talk to a therapist about this, either by yourself or as a couple.


Edit: obviously, no, the trust never came back in that relationship. A relationship without trust is not worth it."

I‚Äôve wondered a lot why men ask women to move in but not to marry. They‚Äôre both serious moves. Why do you think that he wants you to move in? It may be worth asking him about. Does he talk about the future with you? Do y‚Äôall want kids? Are y‚Äôall on the same page about how a house should be kept? Will he expect you to do chores around the house or does he clean up after himself? Will y‚Äôall go half on the bills? What does you moving in meant to him? Is it just a nice thought?

AskWomen,fm6pd7d,t3_fte2du,1585799598.0,"I‚Äôve been reading this book called Atomic Habits. One of the ideas is that people do their best to stick to what they believe is their identity. The book suggests changing your narrative to fit the person you aspire to be. In your case, start telling yourself you‚Äôre a morning person and stop telling yourself you‚Äôre a night owl. Think about things that a morning person would do (go to bed early obviously) and take it further. Why does a morning person wake up so early? What do they accomplish in the morning? 


To make this change stick, you‚Äôll need to have a strong reason for doing so. Otherwise, you‚Äôll find yourself slipping into your old habit of not being a morning person.
