AskGaybrosOver30,fr09u3s,t3_gkczc5,1589788264.0,"I‚Äôve read the comments and I want to play devils advocate here and share a story from my own personal family. Female here btw. 

I think females have the ability to be your greatest ally and here is why:

Females gave birth to you and there is just this unexplainable feeling when someone is your child that no matter what you love them and will do anything for them. The majority of females I know are not homophobic and I truly believe if their son was gay, they would still love them and accept. Because what‚Äôs the alternative? Cutting them out of your life? Why? Over sex? It‚Äôs stupid. 

I think females are curious. They want to learn and feel like they are helping the gay male community. For females I think many want to be friends with gay guys because they want a male to hang with that they don‚Äôt have to worry about being a certain way, saying certain things, and can just be themselves. 

Different times, my Italian American grandmother (born in 1930) had a gay son (my uncle). When he came out my mom told me flat out that she even said ‚Äúso what? He‚Äôs still my son.‚Äù And she accepted it. All of it. 

Don‚Äôt count us out. I truly believe females are your allies for the reasons I stated above. 

Yes I‚Äôm sure there are some psycho Christian ones, but they don‚Äôt represent the majority of us IMO. The normal females don‚Äôt want to associate with them either. Just check out the agnostic and atheist pages... more and more of us are that."

Dental phobia is a REAL thing ... we all get that trust me.

In college for about 1.5 years I ate laxatives every single day and made myself sick... I eventually knew if I didn‚Äôt stop this I would die so I eventually did stop. ‚ÄúRecovered‚Äù. I feel like I let myself go this past 1.5 years and I weigh about 150 lbs. I‚Äôm trying to lose weight without going overboard as I have in the past and I‚Äôm struggling with it.

EatingDisorders,fpmnzpg,t3_gco493,1588737354.0,"I used to be like you and then it got to a point (several times over the years) where I spiraled out of control with an ED.  I remember being a teenager and hating when it was a holiday or super bowl because I was going to have to sit in a room with chips and resist eating them.  I then went on to develop a pretty severe problem in college where I used laxatives on a daily basis... it got to the point where I was so sick from taking laxatives that I eventually had to stop or I just knew I was going to die from it.  I recovered from that after about 1.5 years.  Then in my mid 20s I developed a pretty severe ED when I stopped eating carbs and took the Whole30 to a whole new level and dropped about 25 lbs.  I became obsessed with not eating and only eating a bowl of veggies.

I wish I could say for sure if you have an ED or not, I for sure have struggled with it over the years... but just from your post I see thoughts and patterns that I develop from time to time.
