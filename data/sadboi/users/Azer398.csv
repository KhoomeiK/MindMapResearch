Your superstar striker breaks clean through on goal and is completely uncontested beyond the halfway line - not a fucking chance in hell."

Does it have to have the “1st edition”?

Edit: Actually it’s alright, I’ve looked into it and found out that the secret rares have a silver/holographic print and a certain pattern which mine doesn’t have. Disappointed but it’s alright. I felt it was too good to be true anyway. Thanks for your help."

Can't pull the strings from deep and can't be given any defensive responsibility whatsoever unless you want your team to be punished for it. Needs to be played in a midfield 3 alongside a deep lying playmaker and a quality DM to get the best out of him. His non existent defensive skills/application mean both midfielders alongside him need to be defensively capable. 

Pogba is capable of brilliance but has large deficiencies in his game and needs to have the midfield built a certain way for his brilliance to outweigh his deficiencies. He's a textbook luxury player."
