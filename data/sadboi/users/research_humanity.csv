I disagree really strongly on your brain theories. I don't see any evidence to back any of these up, and I think this could do harm to those who have to live with Aspergers or ADHD. Also, PMS is very strongly related to hormones, not anything to do with trauma. 

>what would they pass down to their child? What coping behaviors and ideas and worldly perceptions would the kid learn from traumatised parents? And what would their parenting style look like?

I have PTSD and also work with special needs kids who can often be violent, truly offensive, and horrifying. I can't even count the number of times these kids have told me in graphic detail how they want to murder me, for example.

The biggest thing I've learned from myself and from them is that people always choose their best option. People generally aren't going to choose what makes other people unhappy for the sake of making other people unhappy. Those choices are their best options. They might not know better or better options might not be as rewarding (hello, unhealthy coping mechanisms), but they are choosing the best they can.

The second biggest thing is that no matter how the behaviors affect me, the other person is lashing out because of how truly miserable they are. It's not a sport, it's not because they enjoy seeing me suffer. It's not about me. That behavior is born out of misery the likes of which I can only imagine. 

So I have a two pronged approach: help them choose better and stop assigning any moral value to trauma reactions. Since these are kids, I teach the correct behaviors, give negative reinforcement for the wrong behaviors, and provide positive reinforcement for the correct behaviors. And then I refuse to tie their actions to their person even just in my head.

Since she's not a child, I would strongly recommend therapy if she's not already in it. But separating PTSD from who she would rather be and understanding that she wants to be better more than you could ever want that is something you can do."

>What's reasonable for a nanny to do? Really we just want childcare but there's a 2-hour lull in the day where both kids nap - what kinds of things are reasonable to expect or ask? What I'd really like is a little light housework like washing bottles, kid laundry, and tidying up. And maybe when we return to work a little bit of meal prep for dinner. Is that reasonable?

Childcare and child-related cleaning. That's it. If you want more, pay for it. As far as filling naptimes: Your kids are not always going to nap perfectly. And she is still working while they are sleeping, because she is not able to leave. This is the only opportunity for her to have a ""break"", and again, she can't even get a real break. Don't try to fill this time.

> Would it be better to start the nanny with slightly lower with pay and then offer a raise after 2-3 months if things are going well? Or start high? I just might not be able to afford much of a raise further down the line.

If you go with the first option, make sure you have this spelled out in the contract including very clear performance metrics that would qualify/disqualify her from that raise. Honestly though, I wouldn't want a raise after months. That's pay my bosses were withholding until what? They trust me? There's just not a good reason to do it. 

> What kind of vacation, sick leave, etc should I offer?

This is going to vary by nanny and by your local laws. For me, I don't actually have a set amount of sick or vacation time. If I'm sick, I let the parents know and have as much time as I need off (a total of 5 days in 3+ years). I also match their vacation schedules, which winds up being 2-3 months out of the year. But I can also ask for any other day off, and I get it.

> What makes a good family that you'd be loyal to and want to stay with?

Kindness, emotional maturity from the parents, and the ability to have hard conversations without making it personal. Everything you'd want from your bosses. Gratitude."

I'm sorry to be blunt, but you've presented threatening to call the police and calling her parents as reasonable options when faced with a tantrum. 

When she gets violent, I recommend leaving. Don't feed into it by giving her attention. When she is calm, then you can go back and work out a solution. (My normal recommendation for violence is immediate punishment, but I'm honestly scared to recommend that to you.)

Set better expectations. Not ""Okay, sounds good!"" but ""Before I approve your room, I need to see this, this, and this. Then you can ride your bike.""

Drop the sarcasm. She had a big feeling of excitement, and your joking popped her bubble before you even had actual proof that her room wasn't clean. You assumed the worst of her, and that joke hurt her feelings before you even saw her room.

Recognize the effort before you give criticism. ""Wow, I see you lined up all your shoes. They look so good, but I think they have a better home in your closet. Let's work together on a few things really quickly.""

Explain consequences clearly and preferably way before things get out of hand. Why were you taking her iPod away? Is that a consequence she should have expected or was it something you decided on in the moment to punish her for making your job harder?

And stop threatening to bring in a bigger authority. You ARE the authority. Act like it. The only reason she responds to you threatening to call the police or her parents is because she recognizes them as authorities. And that's because they act like authorities."

They have likely done this before. Or they have friends who have nannies. Or they were raised by nanies. They are more likely to have a preset idea of what nannies are/do. You might need to correct them on that.

Honestly, there are some. But they are by no means universal (and they WILL be presented as such) and it's a really good way to see what their reaction is like if they are barely inconvenienced by something. Not adjusting yourself to whatever perceived standards they might have is going to help you figure out whether they are people you would enjoy working for.

>When it comes to childcare, are there any rules or values that are common in upper-class households that I might not have encountered before?

Likely a big push on education and extra-curriculars. You will likely have to advocate for their children to have free play and downtime. You will likely have to deal with kids who have incredibly busy schedules that you will need to nanny around. 

Social media: I don't know if you post anything about your NKs online now, but do not assume you can with a wealthier family. This should be explicitly laid out in the contract, but even if it's not, keep every photo and update that even mentions the kids offline and strictly only shared with parents.

Safety: At high income levels, nannies double as baby bodyguards. No one touches the children unless they are cleared. Maintain chain of custody for all handoffs (like making sure the bus driver knows who should be picking kiddo up if there are any changes). For some families that are in the media often, a bruise or scraped knee could be spun as the parents being abusive, so the parents might want long sleeves and pants during all outdoor play as well as full protective gear for anything that could bring an injury. You might also need to brush up on safety rules and general care for things you haven't been around: hot tubs, wine storage, high end appliances (though I was the one who had to demo the brand new, high end dishwasher and microwave to NPs once lol), etc.

You should also ask how they want you to manage things with neighbors/other staff/other people in NK's life. Do they want you to manage conflict with them or go through them? If the neighbors are treating you badly, would they want to talk to them on your behalf or are you allowed to politely correct them? Does that extend to when NK is being hurt or just social situations?"

And then once you take away the illusion that every parent eagerly anticipated their child . .. yeah, it makes sense why they complain, try to get out of parenting, and otherwise try to pawn their responsibilities off on other people. If I was forced into parenting, I'd try not to resent the kid or take it out on the people around me but after years? Oh, I'm sure I would. I'm not that good of a person.

I'm a nanny. I've worked with kids both unwanted and wanted. It really does make a difference when the parents truly want their kids. They can't wait to spend more time with them, because their kids are their favorite people to hang out with.
