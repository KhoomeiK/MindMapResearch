She is childish and obviously knows not to wear white to weddings.

I cannot imagine how frustrating it is to know she is an annoyance and to have so many people back HER on YOUR wedding day."

I’ve been on Zoloft since I was 12 for GAD and MDD. 
Since I was so young and unused to medication, I’d forget to take it for weeks. I’d have a similar withdrawal process: being irritable, moody, and feeling fatigued.

However, it didn’t usually last long. Generally my withdrawal symptoms would gradually disappear within a week.

How much Zoloft did you take? I take 100mg."
