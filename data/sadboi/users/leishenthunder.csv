OriAndTheBlindForest,fmsinqq,t1_fmsf494,1586356233.0,"Not able to glide yet still trying to glitch that back to working, I have the triple jump so I managed to get to the next boss encounter with the Bird. The bird was bugged so I could just move along, I finished that entire section and now I'm trying to get a one of the three remaining wisps, maybe that will fix the game. I'm just not sure where the wisps are in the locations and some I can't access. The flap ability is meant to wake the bear up but I when i used it it doesn't work so still trying to figure that out."
OriAndTheBlindForest,fmsb0lq,t1_fmqu8et,1586351473.0,"Bro check this out

I have the exact same problem, but what was weird that I ended up at the Silent Woods combat shrine by falling through the ground from the Feeding Grounds after I got killed (I know this because the map showed the straight vertical path down). I ended up right in front of the combat shrine. I did the shrine, and then tried to find my way out, but warping didn't work and jumping out of the area does not work either. So now I am stuck.

&#x200B;

Update: Got warp to work after reactivating the combat shrine the second time and let the mobs kill me. Warped out fine. The quest still reads Find Ku but I also have the ""Will of the Wisps"" quest, so just went ahead with it. After getting the first wisp, the Find Ku mission bug disappeared and game continues normally."

AskMen,fkqf86i,t3_fjna0v,1584443605.0,"Interviewing for a web dev job in South Africa. I'm a coloured(mixed race) and the guy doing the interview was white. My name is kind of difficult to pronounce, it's russian/arabic. 

I also have an honours in computer science and am currently doing my masters in AI. This dude tells me they're doing me a favour taking me on because I'm a cost to other companies because I'm just starting out. 

The fucking peak of his bullshit was when he gave me a nickname in the interview because he said it was too difficult to pronounce my name.

On the way out, the secretary, whose this dudes mother, sees me on the way out and says oh you're indian, I can see."

Paddled out and and wave broke directly on my board while I was duck diving. I get forced beneath the kelp along with my board. Tried to get to the surface but couldnt make it past the kelp. Eventually gave up and just accepted it was my time to go. Luckily the next wave came through and made space for my board to pop back up to the surface. I put my hands around my leash and managed to climb my way back to the surface. 

Ended up making it to the backline and had an epic surf."
