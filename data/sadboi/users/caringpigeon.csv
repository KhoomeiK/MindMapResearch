NonBinary,fgn1njl,t3_ezexva,1580935975.0,"Maybe try any vocal training you can? And practice confidence boosting activities like positive affirmation. It may feel like you want to slouch your shoulders and whisper to be perceived less feminine but it will really put a damper on your self esteem and self respect. Remember to stay confident, dress it ways that make you feel happy, the thrift store is your best friend."
NonBinary,fgn1b8z,t3_ezbmz1,1580935785.0,I‚Äôm dfab/Afab and I don‚Äôt identify in a masculine way at all. I actually get really annoyed when people perceive me in a way where they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre female but non-binary so I should call you a handsome king!‚Äù I‚Äôm like...no I‚Äôm not a man either. I‚Äôm neither!!

indieheads,ffurwla,t3_ev8xgc,1580248194.0,"Hi guys, love the lyrics alluding to homosexual attraction sprinkled throughout the albums as a queer fan. I noticed not as much of an abundance of this kind of thing on later albums compared to older ones, is there any reason for that or any thought of writing anything of the sorts in the future? Are they intentionally ,written more to fit the theme of a specific song, or just a joke? Thanks for reading."

BPD,fbi8k18,t3_edam3w,1576893843.0,A guy I was best friends with for several years recently blocked me with no notice as to why besides treating me like shit on and off for months/years and I know it‚Äôs for the best because he never considered my feelings or thoughts when it came to how he treated me. Seeing you move past something like this is very encouraging. Right now I just hope he drops dead or I think about ways I could make him feel bad for being such a horrible unempathetic person. I‚Äôm trying really hard to move past it. You‚Äôre very strong and your clarity is encouraging.
BPD,fal0gs8,t3_e9r2em,1576176223.0,Ice cubes and ice showers when wanting to self harm are the best. Sometimes just thinking about how much the cold will shock me calms me down enough to not hurt myself.
BPD,fafhvpf,t1_fafgqtb,1576023140.0,"And you are valid I mean displacing you‚Äôre old relationship trauma onto a new relationship is a very common symptom of being abused, it‚Äôs just hard work to combat those thoughts. Ive been in a stable relationship with someone for years and still get the occasional paranoid idea that they‚Äôll betray me in the way an ex has. It‚Äôs hard. But you have to keep checking the facts."

BPD,faf86sl,t3_e8i3y6,1576016622.0,I was a horrible horrible partner when I was 18/19 before I got therapy and medication. All I can do is learn from my mistakes and outbursts and find ways to avoid that behavior because of how desperately I don‚Äôt want to lose my partner I‚Äôve now been with for over 3 years. I still mess up but I found someone who is very understanding and willing to work with me.
BPD,faf7znx,t3_e8waui,1576016498.0,"If you truly feel bad about your actions and want to apologize, make sure you‚Äôre doing it in a sincere way. ‚ÄúI did ____ and that was really messed up. I recognize I was wrong and I sincerely apologize‚Äù 
Leave out that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a stupid fuck up and you should leave me‚Äù kind of talk out of it, it ends up making the other person 
1. Uncomfortable 
2. Unable to NOT accept your apology out of guilt
3. Unwillingness to accept your apology out of anger that it doesn‚Äôt sound sincere

In the end you can‚Äôt force anyone to forgive you but you can do slight damage control. How the other person reacts is up to them."
BPD,faf7rq6,t3_e8wg78,1576016361.0,"Accessing medication and therapy is challenging and often expensive, if you can‚Äôt access those things but have somewhere between 5-30 dollars to spend eBay and Amazon have lots of DBT workbooks that may be a good place to start to develop healthy coping skills and ways to ‚Äúrewire‚Äù your thought processes. There may even be some worksheets online. Best of luck."
BPD,faf7dfs,t3_e8xmk1,1576016119.0,You need to stop dating this person. You‚Äôve already ruined all hopes of trust by cheating once. If you can‚Äôt control yourself when using drugs you need to stop doing drugs or stop being in closed relationships..
BPD,faf70kw,t3_e8tq9u,1576015895.0,"You‚Äôre feeling like this because of trauma, it‚Äôs hard work but you have to think about how your feelings of expecting manipulation and abuse are characteristics of past relationship. Check the facts, has your gf done anything to signify she would betray or harm you? If the answer is no, good! Now think about finding ways to have more trust in her. If you don‚Äôt trust someone, as hard as it is to do so, that distrust can build and negatively affect your relationship."
BPD,faf6q4o,t3_e8v0y4,1576015716.0,He‚Äôs literally so unempathetic and disgusting as a person I feel like people just see anyone they decide is crazy and decide BPD is the best fit it‚Äôs so frustrating
BPD,faf6mrw,t3_e7zw34,1576015660.0,I‚Äôve felt so hurt and saddened at the thought of not being someone‚Äôs fp when I‚Äôm fixated on them and it‚Äôs helped a lot to just value people as friends and work on not idolizing them

ofMontreal,f8r2d0c,t3_duvdb2,1574730231.0,"I'm glad he finally addressed this, apologized, and has laid GF to rest. I love of Montreal and I love suggesting the band to people but I always had to warn them about this and now I can finally tell people he's grown. I assumed he had moved past it since it's been so long so it's really nice for him to formally and politely address this. I love Kevin!

And to people saying he shouldn't apologize for art...this piece of ""art"" was really alienating towards trans people and black people. If Kevin himself can recognize that it was shitty surely you can too."
