Most of those friendships won't actually last at the end of the show, since the only thing to do in the circle is talk to eachother, and connections then may seem strong, but in the real world things don't work that way, since they can't be on the phone all day. I am not saying their relationships aren't meaningful, but for a competition  it was not my cup of tea.
The US season was my first too, i thought it was genius, but in other seasons the concept of winning popularity was portrayed better than making soul bonds or whatever. (Real conections are also made in other seasons, but it is not the main goal)

So don't be ashamed for your rough edges. You can get better, and even if you find it hard to picture it, there is always that tiny spark of hope. Let's follow that instead of killing any chances. 
Ask your husband for help, no one wants to have someone they love die. It's even worse if you knew you could've done something to prevent it. At least let him make the attempt of helping you. Same goes to your parents.
You have to make yourself proud, that is what matters the most. No one can make their biggest ambitions overnight, so for now, be proud you can survive the night. Tomorrow is another day, and it is a big cliche, but it has saved me many times. 
Don't be sorry, be proud for making it this far and let's hope for a better tomorrow. Seek help in the people you love the most. And if you still don't want to ask them, call your suicide hotline or go to the hospital. It's the first step to recovery. And you may repeat that step many times until you get better.

Being alone was awful but when I am with my family its worse, I just have to put on a good attitude or they say really hurtful things. Also, I can't have a normal conversation because I just split. I can't stand confrontation and even if we think the same thing I have to argue. It's just with my parents, since they think I can't think and my opinions are manipulated by the ""fake news"" (we are not from the US, but they love some shit trump has said). Anyways, I am living like this for less than a week and I want to hurt myself and get wasted. I won't, I already did when I was alone. I know it will be a tough couple of months but I have to manage. I lived with them for 17 years so it shouldn't be that hard right?

My parents are closed minded, they are still quite homophobic, really religious (nothing wrong with that), and religious in a non ""american"" way, as potrayed in the news, like typical churches here are kind of open minded and with a critical views on politics. Anyway, the problem is that every year they get more religious and they believe all the problems people have, is because they don't have a relationship with god. If you did, nothing would be a problem and everyone would be happy ( in that exact words). So that attitude makes it even worse. I believe they kinda blame my issues in not going to church every sunday.
And you know what's the worst part? I have a cousin with bd and bpd who was admitted in a mental hospital because she was really suicidal and attempted several times and my mom was the one comforting my aunt, so I did think she would be the most supportive. But now she tells me that I'm at least not crazy like her because she was psycho or some shit.

It is so hard when they have that attitude. One time my mom and sister took me out for dinner, and asked me: Ok, you are depressed but you don't wanna actually kill yourself right?

I know I'm privileged and my life is great.
I am the problem! Everything hurts, watching people smile or seeing them cry for the dumbest reasons infuriates me and i feel guilty that i get angry so it's just a dumb cycle of self deprication.

bipolar2,f8kmai7,t3_e0zteg,1574612730.0,"When I get really angry I say out loud: I'm angry don't talk to me. And in my mind I vent with myself and scream all the things i would like to say until I'm calm.
But when they don't listen and keep talking to me in an annoying manner I just explode like a volcano.
People who know my disorder understand is bipolar speaking, not me. But when they don't know it or they don't understand it is when things get ugly.
For me it was a big step to control my anger for a second to announce that I'm really angry and, it was a game changer. People usually understand and leave me alone, and it has dodged me bigger conflicts.
Idk if it works in your case but it could be like a safe word to give you space to vent and to not make a big deal out of something small or not that important.
Best of luck!"

bipolar,f8cqot7,t1_f8cpx18,1574466688.0,"Yeah, but now that i think about it is more of a mixed episode. I just cooked a lot and after i finished i got really sad and disappointed in myself but then i ate it all in anger. It isnt the first time it has happened something like this and i would like to understand why or when does this happens"
