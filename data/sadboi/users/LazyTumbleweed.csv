Vent,fphmffr,t3_gddd9b,1588623855.0,"I've went through the same shit before. I cried for a long time that night. I know that if I went through it, you can do it, too! just take it easy on yourself for as long as you need to, as I bet you're feeling pretty emotionally sensitive or vulnerable like I was during my breakup. I wish you best of luck!"

CatAdvice,foarxnv,t3_g5sguc,1587651486.0,"brush Luna's fur! if she doesn't like it at first, just do a little bit once daily, then give her a treat afterwards. she'll learn to love it quickly, and it's a great way to bond with your cat, prevent hairballs, and care for her fur as she becomes too ill to groom herself. I did the treat-training method for my two 7yo males, and they responded to it quickly. I wish you best of luck with Luna, and I hope she has an amazing last few weeks of life."
Anxiety,fnoxzsr,t3_g2yamz,1587135728.0,"I've had the same thing with depression, and I thought it was normal, I was just exaggerating my emotions too much, or I was defective. I've been taking meds for depression for about a year now, and lemme just say: this whole mental health stuff is a battle that I'm always willing to fight! I've become better this spring and I'm so grateful."

I found that avoiding my triggers until I was calmer and more mentally stable. after I felt more stable, I slowly began re-introducing myself to my triggers, one at a time, and it helped me feel more at peace with my triggers. when I was exposed to my triggers again, I didn't have the PTSD reaction as badly, and it helped me stay calmer around my triggers."
