Definitely go find and visit a therapist if you are in a similar situation, I know it really helped me. As for the school therapist, I don't know for sure, and it also depends on where you live, but from what I know is that they have to be somewhat transparant and open to your parents. I visited my schools' therapist once (They wanted to see me because the gym teacher saw my SH scars) and I know I did not feel at ease at all. I ended up just saying what they wanted to hear to leave me alone. In my case they were by law required to contact my parents about what they know. *A* therapist is probably better than none, however maybe something to keep in mind."

If I didn't live with my father I probably would have already stopped getting out of bed, or skipped a few/all meals everyday. everything is grey or black so to speak. It's just another bad relapse into depression.

Thing is that I don't want to talk about it with my dad. I did that a few times in the past, but I see how much it pains him to know how I feel, so I'd rather have him not know. I don't want to put him through that again."

 I too wholeheartedly agree with the philosophy behind it. Your scars show you where you come from, what you have been through. What is a part of you and probably what has shaped you. Imperfection to me is beautiful.

Edit: this post has inspired me to write a little something, here it is:

&nbsp;

'To be imperfect is perfect'

&nbsp;

Some people only accept perfection

All they want is the best

The most beautiful

The greatest

The most successful

&nbsp;

Because some people believe

That only perfection is good enough

Only those who are perfect

Have in their eyes succeeded

And everyone else has failed

&nbsp;

To some people there's no try

To them there's only succes or failure

They demand of you to be perfect

To never show a weakness

To them imperfection is to be hidden

&nbsp;

But I beg to disagree

&nbsp;

Perfection is boring

It is lifeless, soulless

Imperfection is human

To be alive is to fail

And we all fail, constantly

&nbsp;

Imperfection is a beautiful thing

It is a strength, not a weakness

It tells a story, it shows character

It makes something live

It makes it real

&nbsp;

So here is my message to you

No matter what you are like

No matter what scars you have

I am sure that you

Are beautiful too"

They do have similarities, both are populist and radical, each in their own way. 

The part however that makes PvdA very different from VB is that VB is pretty racist, if not in policy then in politians. VB wants to opress certain groups in society. With PvdA you have a bunch of people who support certain ideas that may or may not be feasable, but who do certainly not opress nor aim to opress anyone. There lies a huge difference in my opinion.
