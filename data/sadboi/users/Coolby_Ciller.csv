yandere,fpwsesj,t1_fpwo6no,1588969117.0,yeah true if she doesnt watch anime that would be cringe. considering shes obsessive what do you think her reaction would be if she found your reddit and all your posts snooping through your phone? how would you explain it?

It is certainly an interesting outcome I would also want to see happen but definitely not the best outcome I would want.
