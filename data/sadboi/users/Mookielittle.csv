So I'm sure there's plenty of do's and don'ts... Just  seems to me that those SSN benefits you are referring to may only be for a permanent resident at least."
immigrationlaw,fr3t71f,t1_fr3rv5o,1589865590.0,Mine was for a year. I think that's the general time they give you. I Kept having to renew 6 months before it expired so you got the new EAD in time so there were no gaps in employment authorization.

immigrationlaw,fr0h4sx,t3_gltbxb,1589795464.0,"That is correct. Any one foreign can (under prerequisites) apply for employment authorization. However, this does not grant any form of legal protection from being deported. I know because I had that. Currently working out something else outside of the US to return with lawful admission to the US. There is a criteria. Not 100% sure of what exactly but I'm sure that you can't have a criminal record (at the most misdemeanor). Not a lawyer. Speaking from experience. Also, you are correct about the govt jobs. That requires some clearance that is not attainable being undocumented or simply not a US citizen."

ImmigrationCanada,f7ficv8,t1_f7dr4ep,1573680031.0,"NOC? Cost? The removal process here in the US seems to be a mental game. How long can you last with the weight of being deported on your shoulders. It can last a while with the right amount of resources to buy you time and not only that, every due process hearing is months, if not a year, apart from the previous court hearing. I'm just entering my trial phase aside from the NTA(notice to appear) and no longer in preliminary stages. All we have done is bought time to try to resolve something. Since 2016. Money is not easy to come by when it comes to legal fees. So as far as the proof of knowing the skill, I need a resume showing that? Or some portfolio? I have a resume simply for what I professionally worked. The side jobs I've worked would clearly not be mentioned on it. Is there a site where I can search what's in demand right now as far as looking for a job offer from Canada?"
