This was ‚Äò82-84 so the music was still pretty good! There weren‚Äôt that many videos so they played everything there was. Stuff from the ‚Äò60s like Cream and the Doors was mixed in with the 80s stuff‚ÄîPat Benatar, U2, the Clash, Berlin, Go-Gos, Psychedelic Furs, Elvis Costello, Billy Idol, Madonna, etc. Chaka Khan ‚ÄúI Feel for You‚Äù. Cyndi Lauper, so much good stuff.

The town I lived in eventually got MTV but I never loved it quite as much as I did the first couple of years. It really was about the music back then, and it was fun and amateurish, lower production values‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù crap like it turned into later. They actually interviewed artists, showed concerts, and had giveaways like ‚Äúwin a date with Prince‚Äù. It just felt like everyone was welcome as long as you loved music.

Edit: my favorite? Some videos were better than others for sure, most of them already mentioned, but I will always have a huge soft spot for the song ‚ÄúSouth Central Rain‚Äù by R.E.M."
