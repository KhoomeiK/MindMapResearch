BPD,fp1vzea,t1_fp1jonv,1588249344.0,Yea i don't have it in me to stop talking to them..
BPD,foy7hha,t1_foy4tga,1588167039.0,"No, I ended up finishing my bed frame and instead of feeling proud of myself I cried for 2 days and idk how long it will take for me to get inspired again. I was in a funk for a month before I finally felt like doing the bed frame.. so now I just have to keep feeding my brain with positivity until I get myself out of this new funk.. it just sucks and I want to stop talking to my parents cuz they are the reason for my BPD and obviously are making it worse for me."
BPD,fowjr95,t3_g7qxj3,1588121140.0,"Yes, I just experienced something Friday. I've been trying my luck in wood projects and was building a bed frame. My dad saw me unloading lumber from my Jeep and asked what I was up to.. i told him and he doesn't know how to build anything so I think he felt intimidated or some shit. Next day I get a text from him that I need to lose weight and sends me a link for weight loss pills. Like trying to remind me that I'm still shitty.. like.. oh kay thanks? Fuckin unreal."
BPD,fowisk4,t1_fowihc7,1588120599.0,I'll just build a house of cards with my hand. Tired of the game.. need to get creative.
BPD,fowhajq,t1_fooas2u,1588119761.0,That's terrible. I'm sorry.
BPD,fowfl2n,t3_framg2,1588118810.0,All the fucking time!!!
BPD,fowfaud,t3_g8i23f,1588118654.0,"Yes, my parents made me hide the fact that I was molested by my uncle and said I would ruin my cousins lives of I ever said anything so I stayed quiet while the abuse continued. My dad is also a narcissist and would constantly criticize me while my mother stood by and watched while doing nothing.  My father also beat me for small shit that I still don't understand how I deserved it. Long story short.. I'm 34 now and trying to retrain my brain has been brutal but its getting better.. i think. Idk."
