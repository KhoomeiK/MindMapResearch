Korean,etwfc0e,t1_etwdpee,1563267465.0,"i think it depends on whether the group promotes their  group name (where it is written on music sites, tvs, variety show nametags etc) using hangul or latin alphabets. I think i never seen nct promoting themselves as ÏóîÏãúÌã∞, but rather used NCT. Other examples like RV promoting using Î†àÎìúÎ≤®Î≤≥ and not 'Red Velvet'. not so sure tho"
