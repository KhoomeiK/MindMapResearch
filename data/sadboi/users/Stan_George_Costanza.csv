BPD,fqr5yul,t1_fq8guqd,1589578219.0,"Sorry for the late reply, it's been a crazy couple of days. Ohhh that's a good point, those very well could become forms of SH instead. The frozen orange idea sounds good, it's uncomfortable enough to make you snap out of it but it's not as harmful as those other two coping mechanisms... hmm I might just buy a travel-sized mini freezer just for the sake of carrying around frozen oranges with me wherever lol 

Oh man distraction for the sake of not facing reality is a big habit of mines too. I used to just play animal crossing whenever there was even a slight disturbance in my life haha. But I like to think that I'm handling it better!! I realized that I'm living through once-in-a-lifetime years (grad school, particularly) and I 100% wanna be there for it, be they bad times or good times.  

Ok, one asshat it is then. Haha but in all seriousness I'm glad to hear that you were able to gain some insights/reflections despite the terrible situation you must've gone through. If I remember correctly, you think that you yourself may have BPD, right? What else have you learned about the diagnosis since coming here? (If you don't mind my asking)

Haha thanks!! I guess we're both brave, then.. facing our inner turmoil despite how daunting it can be. Sometimes it takes meeting the wrong people to make us realize what it is we need to work on in ourselves. I actually just had this happen recently to me too! I realized how hypocritical I can be sometimes, in that I'm judgemental of others that don't communicate/ talk through their problems, yet here I am running away at the slightest hint of trouble. It's an unnerving realization, so I can sympathize with you that all this self-awareness is daunting. But hey, we're both making important progress & I'm proud of us!! Keep on, keepin' on"

BPD,fpt8y8s,t1_fpqee63,1588886945.0,"Hahah so it's like the 'what would jesus do' sort of coping strategy hm? Honestly I think looking to other people for guidance/coping is a great mechanism!! If it works, it works. I'm happy to hear that you seem to be 50/50 on emotions and logic, and I can also see how that could result in doing thought circles w/yourself... since emotions can affect logic & vice versa. Personally I want to try out the ice cube or chili pepper coping strategies, if biting into something that spicy won't change my mood then idk what will

Oh no I'm so sorry you had to deal with those asshats :/ it sounds like they dragged you into their insecurities. I hope you find someone that treats you with the respect you deserve soon!! 

Hm, so if I understand correctly you tend to be attracted to people with similar traits as you. That makes sense, I think we all gravitate to what's familiar and comforting (in my case, that was low empathy since that was the type of household I grew up in!) Actually I think that hard-headed mission of yours is really brave, not everyone can muster up the courage to face themselves.. just make sure that any resulting self-hate is brief& temporary, the end result should be acceptance + healing! 

Yeah, exactly! Good luck on your journey of healing :) I'm sure you'll make lots of positive changes. & thank you!! Here's to changing our negative patterns ðŸ¥‚"

BPD,fpps74u,t1_fppkjkb,1588808121.0,"Yeah, agreed! It's a hard balancing act, the emotional side always seems to want to win. What coping mechanisms do you use/recommend, if you don't mind me asking? 

Ohh interesting!! Yeah, from all the psychology classes I've taken I think it's normal/healthy to be emotionally attached to your name- ofc, either extreme (e.g., lack of acknowledgement or an obsession) with your name would be cause for concern. p.s. I probably made you go through some bad memories with that question on your exes, sorry!! 

ooo yeah I understand why you'd want to avoid people like that. I should probably do the same, I tend to fall for people that have low levels of empathy oof"

Anyway we drifted apart so I guess there's no reason to worry about it anymore. Thank you for your kind words though! I'm in a better place now, I hope you're doing well right now too. 

It's amazing how much emotional weight something as simple as a name could have, right?? Hm, I wonder why your exes hated their names so much. Maybe they associated their name with someone (-thing?) of the past? It sucks that they used such a manipulative tactic on you, sorry you had to go through that."

But given my current mental state (e.g., easily get obsessed) and my continuing dissatisfaction with where I'm at right now, I think it's better for me to ignore fiction for a long while now. I'll go back to it when I'm in a better mental headspace and am more confident in my ability to balance things. & yes, what you described in your last paragraph--I was sort of doing that too!

BPD,fk7kbru,t3_fgukpe,1583938224.0,"Yessss this is super relatable, I've had this problem for such a long time. Reality hurts so much, plain and simple. I'd read tons of fiction and watch shows just as a means to escape. It felt good, but only for a few hours. I'd feel so guilty and dissatisfied whenever I had to get back to the real world. For years, I tried countless times to stop this obsession, but I'd always cave in after a week or so. It's not until recently that I can finally say that I've beat it-- I haven't submerged myself in fiction since August! (About 8 months). It sucked so much at first, during the first month I felt super anxious and suicidal  But after that, it only got better. I love my work now & the people I work with; I'm far more appreciative of the things I have in life, and I feel a lot more in control of myself so my confidence has increased. That's not to say that I don't have depressive episodes anymore; I've had many since then, but I choose to face my feelings rather than escape them now. I know they will eventually pass. 

I realize this all probably sounds crazy to a neurotypical, so I don't talk about it wirh my friends.
