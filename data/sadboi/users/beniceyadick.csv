>I'm not sure if it's just because your second hand sales avenues for sales isn't as developed as they are here in Canada (Kijiji, UsedCanada, facebook marketplace), 

Not sure what you mean by developed but we've got offerup, craigslist, Facebook marketplace, Instagram, etsy, poshmark, mercari, letgo, and obviously Ebay and Amazon to mention the popular ones. 


>somehow the US GoodWill stores regularly undervalue (& frequently even highly undervalue) items, even blatantly high quality items that could sell for ten times as much.

As an avid thrifter, I find this untrue for popular brands.  Goodwill employees are researching brands and putting high prices on clothing, especially. Goodwill had it's own Ebay store and its own website where you can shop for higher end items. Often at the goodwill retail Jean's can be 30 bucks. I suppose it depends on which area you live in too but it's almost laughable the prices they put on items when they've gotten it for free and goodwill is supposed to be helping the low income community. Sometimes they'll mark Trarget items for higher than targets sale price. Target donates all unsold out of season items to goodwill. 

I'm not sure where you live in Canada but I live in a very populated area, so more people, more donations. 

Wealthy people don't have the same sense of the dollar as i do, clearly, So they'll donate 300$ pair of jeans. Or they can't be bothered to resell. Some do tho. 

As a reseller, I mainly source at the goodwill outlets, or the bins, where all unsold goodwill Retail goes for last chance. I see ridiculous goodwill Retail tags on many of the items and it doesn't surprise me that nobody bought say a dress for 29.99 from goodwill retail."
