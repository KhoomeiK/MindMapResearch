It’s horrible getting to this place , I have to watch my grandmas heart break every time she hears I’ve relapsed . My grandma always says she just wants me to be happy and I feel so bad that I can’t even promise her that . I have to watch her go through sleepless nights because she’s worrying about me . I’m so scared that the stress I bring to her is going to kill her , and if she goes I will be losing my mum , grandma , and best friend . If she goes I most certainly will not be able to stay , I wish my grandma has the granddaughter she deserves . She’s done so much for me and I feel guilty because All I end up bringing is worry . I want to tell her that but I can’t in case she feels guilty . I just don’t want to see my grandma suffer because of my suffering .

selfharm,ezaj2lt,t1_ez7dfa3,1567802424.0,"Ok , you seem to have been born yesterday so I’ll explain how therapy works . 
Therapy usually involves getting some sort of connection to a person ( obviously not sexual and if the practitioner starts feeling sexual about the person they should stop their sessions and refer the person to a different psychologist as obviously it would affect their ability to DO THEIR JOB ) the connection is needed for trust which anyone who has half a brain would know . 
She had felt she trusted the psychologist enough to show him the scars *no one else has seen before* which is obviously a big deal for someone struggling. For someone to show proper help rather than just empathy ( therapy isn’t just where you go to someone for empathy ) they need to have a level of trust and understanding , to do so they need to know the extent of the persons issues. Scars is a fairly obvious way to understand this extent as they are literally marks of the pain someone feels in the inside but on their skin . 

To know someone’s suffering and empathise it isn’t enough to be a therapist to someone . A therapist is meant to help you work through your problems and issues , a therapist can’t do that through knowing of suffering . That’s why in therapy you do something called talk . This helps the person work through their mind and understand how to get through it . A psychologists job is to see how someone’s Brian works and understand why people do what they do , how is someone meant to work out why someone does what they do if they REFUSE to know what they’ve even done ? 

Do you see where I’m going with this ? 
You clearly know nothing about psychology and neither does the one to treat this lady like this . Don’t comment on something you clearly know nothing about especially when you are on subs and communities as sensitive as this . The people on here have lots of sensitive issues that can’t be fucked with without seriously affecting Somone . Please learn to keep your mouth shut when what your saying is ridiculous on here ."
selfharm,ezagx16,t3_d06qy9,1567801256.0,"I think your psychologist is just being a bit of a cunt . You were most certainly not being inappropriate by trying to tell the person who’s meant to help you the extend of your issues . He’s basically just refused to do his job because he’s assuming a body part to be sexual because of peoples views on it . Jesus it’s not like you asked to show him a picture of your boobs or something . 

I’m so sorry that happened and it shouldn’t have , please send him this thread to show him what an asshole he was to you . It’s not fair and not appropriate to shoot you down like that with something so close to home for you . Please get a different psychologist, perhaps a female one so she has less of an excuse and it might be more comfortable for you too ? Just please don’t go to that guy again . He’s clearly not prepared to do his job right at the moment ."
SuicideWatch,ezag3xk,t1_ez9w2sk,1567800823.0,"I know it’s not easy to live like this , believe me I know , but do you really want to do this ?

So I guess what I’m saying is , is it really better to end existing altogether than to fight and have a chance at being happy with where you are in life ? If you leave now you’ll have no chance of ever feeling again , if you stay and fight , yeah you’ll get bruises and hurt , but you’ll also have a much better chance of being truly happy . 

I wanted to end it , and if I’m honest I still do . But I’m fighting . Yeah I have scars . Yeah I get hurt . But at least now I can feel .
