latebloomerlesbians,fpo1lmp,t3_gegw82,1588776729.0,Thank you so much for this post. I'm bisexual and demisexual and I'm thrilled that you mentioned both in your post. Sometimes I feel overlooked in sex related discussions.
StCharlesMO,fpo15wj,t1_fpnrrhg,1588776504.0,Sure. It's the UAW Local 2250 hall. Address is 1395 E Pearce Blvd.
AmItheAsshole,fpo04kd,t3_gel54k,1588775962.0,"NTA. Why risk your life for someone you barely know? Honestly, they probably won't even know you're absent. Just send them a card and a gift card and wish them well. 


If they get angry that's on them. If they care about you they will be understanding. If not, you don't need them in your life."

StCharlesMO,fphwaop,t1_fphn4oz,1588628987.0,Absolutely! I'm always down for skating.
StCharlesMO,fpgly5i,t3_g93qrx,1588605270.0,"Hi! I live in Wentzville and there's an amazing parking lot near me. I'm also on your derby team and would love to meet up for a practice. The lot is huge and we can get some skating in while being well above 6 feet apart. You know how to contact me.

rollerderby,fp7go2z,t3_gbk4o1,1588370275.0,These are absolutely amazing!!!!! Thank you. I'm sharing them with my fresh meat group.
AmItheAsshole,fp3amv2,t3_gaw4yl,1588275995.0,"YTA.

I was leaning towards not an asshole until I read that you didn't throw your daughter a baby shower. That's fucked up, honestly. If you didn't throw her one due to health reasons (sick in bed or hospitalized or something) then that's one thing, but your wording leads me to believe that didn't throw her one just because you were salty about her ""situation."""
stopdrinking,fosihrn,t3_g9c2dr,1588031364.0,"I feel this. I only drink for the effects. I don't like alcohol for it's sake. It's what it does to me. I have only had one beer or one drink, but that's rare. If I'm going to drink I drink at least until I'm tipsy. I don't have any sober days yet. I'm currently in a relapse. I have limited resources now that we are in a pandemic, but I want to get sober. Once I do I will have to stay away completely. Thank you for sharing your story."
stopdrinking,focor4o,t3_g6k6xn,1587673903.0,I'm a parent. This hit me hard. Thank you.
StLouis,fo7o72x,t3_g66nqh,1587581684.0,Lol but cover your nose

JUSTNOMIL,fo6lp42,t1_fo6eoma,1587561840.0,What's a good spray? I need some help with my cats.
stopdrinking,fo3ulyp,t1_fo3ujiu,1587493214.0,Thanks. I really appreciate your help and encouragement.
stopdrinking,fo3ueq4,t1_fo3sdwd,1587493118.0,I should try this. I look at my entire life of no drinking and it's overwhelming. One day at a time is fabulous advice.
stopdrinking,fo3nwwb,t1_fo3lud1,1587490052.0,I know my issues are made worse by drinking. But that temporary relief is so nice.
stopdrinking,fo3nr6w,t1_fo3j3uq,1587489976.0,Thank you. I will be seeking help.
stopdrinking,fo3npqc,t1_fo3iivm,1587489957.0,Thank you especially for the story about your dad. Maybe it's not too late for me and my kids.
stopdrinking,fo3lqsi,t1_fo3jji4,1587489026.0,"I definitely need tools. I'm wondering if I should build my toolbox first then quit? I tried the quitting thing before but I didn't have tools so here I am. 

I would absolutely love to no longer be suicidal. I hate it."
stopdrinking,fo3llqg,t1_fo3j84h,1587488957.0,"Good thoughts here. What is an IOP? I have several diagnosis and am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist (who wanted to put me on meds but I refused for some reason. Idk why). I'm pretty much always low-key suicidal (the lazy kind,not the active kind), and they both know this."
stopdrinking,fo3ik51,t1_fo3hzoj,1587487490.0,"I drink a minimum of three drinks a day, usually some combo of beer and vodka. I have severe depression that started before I began drinking, and some other mental health issues. I have a traumatic history and I drink to numb, in spite of being in therapy and on medication. I hate being hungover but I love being drunk. I want to be drunk all the time. But I don't want to hurt my kids. Part of me thinks they would be better off without me. I know it's not true, but it's how I feel."
stopdrinking,fo0tzws,t1_fo0ts2t,1587419729.0,"Last year I went 118 days sober, then said fuck it. Now I'm drinking every day but I don't get drunk every day. I don't know what that means, but honestly I'm starting to get a little scared."
stopdrinking,fo0tob0,t3_g4zvcx,1587419558.0,"I'm going through this right now, but kind of the opposite. People who are closest to me keep saying I have a problem, but I'm not sure I do. I don't have any advice, but I can offer you solidarity as we both figure this out.

ETA: a friend sent me this text today. It kind of hit home.

stopdrinking,fnugkfd,t1_fnucyt0,1587261592.0,"You're cool. I mentioned therapy in my previous post in this group. 

I had a sober buddy, but he no longer talks to me because I relapsed (I had 118 sober days until October of last year). I don't know if I have a choice but to do this alone."
stopdrinking,fnucke9,t1_fnucfnx,1587259139.0,I am in therapy. But my therapist suggested meetings. Idk. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
stopdrinking,fnuchy8,t1_fnuc7au,1587259099.0,I'll look those up. Thanks!
stopdrinking,fnucgzm,t1_fnuc2yr,1587259083.0,"My doc wants to put me on that. I'm unsure. Mainly because I'm afraid to stop drinking, ya know?"
stopdrinking,fnu300z,t1_fnu1yjq,1587253550.0,"Yeah, I can't take it or leave it. If I'm not drinking I'm looking forward to the time when I can drink (be it in an hour, or two weeks). I guess that's a problem?"
depression,fnt21r0,t3_g3ljni,1587233112.0,"Yup. 

I deactivated FB and Mesenger recently because of this. My therapist told me before I check up on someone I should ask myself why I am texting them. Turns out I was bored and needed validation. I'm now focusing on doing something to combat the boredom and trying to affirm myself instead of seeking attention elsewhere. It's a battle, but we'll with fighting."
stopdrinking,fnt0jj1,t1_fnsz7a2,1587232308.0,"I don't want it to be a problem. That scares me. But the more I think about it, the more I think it is. 

I could not drink last night and had terrible cravings. It sucked. That makes me think I might be addicted to alcohol. 

I have not read the book. Thanks! I'll see if I can find a copy."
