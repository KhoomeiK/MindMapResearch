u_dennismiller2024,flz88l3,t3_frvc76,1585617705.0,"And I worked my ass off campaigning to even be competitive against the most popular kid in school. His name is Jake and he’s the star player on both the basketball and football teams. Every prom king for the past decade has been a jock and I think Jake just ran because everyone assumed he would. Unlike Jake, I actually care about getting elected prom king because I want to be an inspiration to the majority of the school who aren’t popular like Jake and his friends, and I thought that maybe I could appeal to this majority to keep Jake from taking the crown.

Now, I’m not a complete outcast, but I’m not athletic and don’t really hang out with people outside my small group of friends. However, I am friendly with almost the entire senior class so I knew early on that I could win the election if I worked hard enough. I started my campaign when I realized that Jake would be running unopposed by having my friends and I persuade potential voters in the school hallway. It was going to be difficult to beat Jake using traditional campaigning methods so we thought of ways to increase my vote share relative to Jake’s. For example, we tried to split the vote between Jake and another athlete, but Jake was too well-liked and no athlete wanted to run against him. The strategy we settled on was increasing prom turnout among students less likely to attend prom because that’s the demographic most likely to vote for me.

During our hallway campaigning, I realized that there is a strong anti-jock sentiment among the senior class, but it’s especially strong among unreliable prom attendees. If I could persuade a fraction of them to show up to prom then their friends would likely come with them. For example, I know for a fact that my friend Rob and his girlfriend are going to prom. His girlfriend is bringing her friends who might bring more people who wouldn’t otherwise show up. In fact, all my friends are unreliable prom attendees. I had already increased turnout by a substantial margin without even trying. Beating Jake was going to be easier than I thought, as long as I could get past initial voting.

On a Monday two months before prom, every member of the senior class gets handed an initial voting ballot by their first period teacher. They are instructed to write down one name for prom king and one name for prom queen. Every senior that gets 50 or more votes is put on the final ballot, and only prom attendees vote for prom king and queen from the final ballot. Getting past initial voting would be easy because everyone is allowed to vote. I thought that winning from the final ballot would be much harder, but when I realized how many of my friends were going to prom the dream started to seem more like a reality.

On the Friday before the Monday of initial voting, I was confident that I was going to pass the 50 vote threshold by a large margin. I felt like my work was starting to pay off, but my excitement didn’t last long. When I got home from school, I opened up my computer and saw that Jake posted a facebook status update:

""Dear prom king voters. After much consideration, I have decided to drop out of the prom king race. To all of the students who were planning on voting for me, I would like you to vote for Austin [last name]. Austin is one of the nicest and most caring members of the class of 2020. Everytime I see him in the hallway, he has a smile on his face, and that always puts a smile on my face. There is no one in the senior class with as much school spirit as Austin, and I don't think any of us can imagine [high school name] without him. I cannot think of a better choice for prom king than Austin [last name].""

Austin has autism. All this time, I thought that Jake was my real opponent. I never even considered the possibility that he wasn’t. My entire strategy was centered on beating Jake by positioning myself as the anti-jock, but now I was the jock. The higher prom turnout would hurt me now. Austin didn’t even campaign and within five minutes he was the frontrunner.

All the work I put into this campaign was erased with a single facebook post. All the work my friends put in. It was all for an unwinnable election. Losing the election fairly would’ve felt better than what I felt reading Jake’s post. I was angry. Angry at myself. Angry at Jake. I know he had good intentions, but why didn’t he tell me he was dropping out before he sabotaged my campaign? I was about ready to give up.

But then I had an idea.

On Sunday, I posted this on facebook:

""Thank you to everybody who plans on nominating me for prom king. However, I am telling everyone who was planning on voting for me to vote for Billy [last name]. I've known Billy since kindergarten and there is no one who cares as much about the school as Billy. I’m not going to list every reason why Billy should be picked to represent our class, because you all already know that he is a representation of everything that our school strives to be. All I will say is that I am proud to call Billy a friend. So for those of you planning on voting for me tomorrow, thank you, but I will be casting my vote for Billy [last name] and I think that you should too.""

Billy has down syndrome. The perfect spoiler for Austin.

Because Jake posted his facebook status on Friday, all of his voters saw it or talked to someone over the weekend who saw it. I posted my facebook status on Sunday so only some of my voters saw it. I even unfriended some of my likely voters to make sure I stayed above the 50 vote threshold. It worked, because on Friday the school revealed the three seniors who made it onto the final ballot: Austin, Billy, and Me. For the first time, I was the frontrunner.

This was one month ago. Prom is scheduled for a month from now, but the school will either delay it or cancel it because of the coronavirus. I understand and respect whatever decision my school makes because I understand the real threat of coronavirus, but that doesn’t mean I have to be happy about it. I am praying every night that my school doesn’t cancel prom.

Prom is supposed to be a milestone in our lives and a giant step into adulthood, but every prom just ends being a way for the popular kids to pretend they’re royalty. For the majority of students, prom is just a dance that they go to because they feel like they have to, if they even go at all. But this prom was supposed to change that. This prom was supposed to topple the social hierarchy. This was going to be our year. And if prom is cancelled, then so are the dreams of every social outcast, everyone who doesn't fit in with the popular crowd, everyone who feels like they don’t have a voice. Everyone who was looking up to me to be their king."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgvuBIdW5GU
They’ve got skills. They’re athletic. They’re already used to being famous so they wouldn’t get nervous during a game. So why aren’t they in the NBA?

Tyler Tony is the obvious choice for the nba because he has the most battle wins. The only problem with him is that he’s 5’9’’ so it would be difficult for him to break into the NBA, but not impossible. The Cotton brothers don’t have the same accolades as Tyler Tony and they’re also 5’9’’, but they have a similar shooting ability as Tony that could come in clutch. Garrett Hilbert is 5’11’’, but I don’t think he has the dedication to be an NBA player. These four players have potential but they would be risky draft picks. However, there’s one more Dude Perfect Member that I haven’t mentioned yet.

Cody Jones is the best fit for the NBA right now. I know what you’re thinking. Cody Jones? He’s the Jokester of the group. How does he have the dedication to be in the NBA but Garrett Hilbert doesn’t? I’ll tell you why.

Garrett Hilbert has not been in many recent dude perfect videos. He’s been married for nine years and he has three kids. He’s the least skilled of the group. He’s generally considered “the dad” of the group. He manages the finances. He cleans the Dude Perfect house. This is not a knock on Hilbert. I think he’d agree with me that he doesn’t have the dedication for the game.

Cody Jones on the other hand is NBA ready. He’s the tallest in the group at 6’6’’. He’s played sports his entire life. He’s got the athleticism. He’s got a high basketball IQ. He’s got the coordination and IQ to be good on defense. He may be the jokester of the group, but he’s serious about basketball. While he doesn’t have the same accolades as a Tyler Tony, this is not entirely his fault. Cody Jones had to miss three battles that I think he would have won. I think, with enough work, Cody Jones could be a 6’6’’ Steph Curry with better defense.

TL;DR: I think that all of the Dude Perfect guys could play in the NBA. However, if I was a team owner with a number one pick, I would pick Cody Jones."

dogs,fj8t7d7,t1_fj8rva8,1583121587.0,"Those two dogs you got for free, would you say they're worth more or less than 500 dollars? Or are they equal in value to 500 dollars?"
dogs,fj8t2ex,t1_fj8sgea,1583121483.0,I'm sorry but I still don't believe you. If that's true then someone can make a lot of money off those free dogs.
dogs,fj8rrel,t1_fj8eco7,1583120527.0,I doubt that. I'm pretty frugal but even I'll admit that a 500 dollar dog is gonna be higher quality than a free dog.
dogs,fj8lp5y,t1_fj8kh89,1583116324.0,"Sounds like a flawed business model on their end, then."
dogs,fj8k50y,t1_fj8irnp,1583115271.0,"I'm not trying to make this about money. I'm just saying that getting something for free that I would have paid 500 dollars for raises some red flags. I apologize if it sounded like I describing a supermarket deal. That was unintentional. As for the 500 dollar vet bill, I might get two of the free dogs and sell one to cover it. Thank for you the advice, and again I apologize."
dogs,fj8hwcc,t1_fj8c2h0,1583113784.0,"It's called a ""shelter."" Kinda a vague name. It's shady, looks like a jail."
dogs,fj8f1yj,t1_fj8e3n1,1583111901.0,"I did some more research and it's listed as an ""animal shelter."" Again, still seems too good to be true considering I was ready to spend 500 dollars on a new dog."
dogs,fj8drkr,t1_fj8bchj,1583111039.0,"I don't know. That's why I'm here. It definitely looks shady, almost like a prison."
dogs,fj8d0y6,t1_fj8bbv7,1583110541.0,They call them “adoptions” but I think that’s just for legal purposes. Essentially they give away dogs for free.

AskReddit,fiz44z0,t3_fale4c,1582853703.0,I'm sick of the lying Benihana advertisements. All of them talk about the food. None of them talk about the glory holes. What a great way to piss off your most loyal customers. It's like they're ashamed of the people that keep them in business. Soon I will stop supporting them.
u_dennismiller2024,fin81ld,t3_f8sryv,1582557928.0,"I knew Elizabeth Warren was a charismatic person, but the television screen does not do her justice. You cannot truly connect with Elizabeth or feel her energy from behind a screen. Seeing her in person is something that I hope everyone in the world can experience because it would make the world a better place. It’s already made me a better person.

What first struck me about Elizabeth is how unscripted she sounds. At a certain point, I stopped paying attention to what she was saying and just listened to Elizabeth Warren. I got lost in the rhythm and sounds of the noises that came out of her mouth and how they moved the crowd. This wasn’t about policy or even the presidential election. The specifics of what she was saying were distractions from the broader existential question of the sole of our nation.

I was ten rows back, but even if I was at the far opposite end of the room and had earplugs in and a blindfold on, I could still feel the electricity emanate from Elizabeth Warren. It was surreal. Halfway through the speech I saw sparks shoot off her body. The full hour, in retrospect, felt like another plane of existence and flipped my perception of my own place in this world. When the speech was coming to a close, I recognized it but I wasn’t sad. It was a gentle and comforting cool down that left me with hope for our future and a new appreciation for humanity.

There’s been a lot of discussion recently about whether or not a woman can win the election and I share some of that fear. I think that America is sexist and it’s an uphill battle for any person from a marginalized group to win over half the country. But if there’s one woman who can do it, it’s Elizabeth Warren because I don’t see Elizabeth Warren as a woman. I see Elizabeth Warren as a healer, as a force for good, and I don’t think of her as a woman in the same way that I don’t think of Jesus as a man.

I was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren before, but seeing her live made me connect with her like I haven’t connected with any politician. Because she isn’t a politician. A politician would run for president out of their own ego but Elizabeth is running for the good of the country. If we don’t elect Elizabeth Warren we are making a huge mistake, and we definitely can’t give up now because this story isn’t over yet."
ElizabethWarren,fim0262,t1_filn4kl,1582514577.0,"Thank you for your comment. I should make it clear that I am not a Christian, however Jesus is probably the most influential person of all time. I'm not saying that Elizabeth Warren is divine or magical. I'm making a historical comparison because I think it's important to learn from history to guide our future. If we don't learn from history then we are bound to repeat it."
