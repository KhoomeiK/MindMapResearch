I didnt understand why they wouldn't let me but now I get that its it's prohibitively expensive for a lower middle class family."
childfree,fdglszc,t3_el7pig,1578401633.0,"Huh. I've had migraines since I was 2 (thanks to Dad's genes), and by age 7 my mother put it together with hormones as I had one every 28 days like clockwork. Still do, 25 years later. I e never once heard a hysterectomy mentioned as a potential way to reduce the number of migraines I have. If it could lessen the number of migraines I have a year by 12, that wouldn't be much relief but some relief.

Thanks for this, I now have research to do!"

AskReddit,fd2mq84,t1_fczfazg,1578149424.0,"As kids, we used to crawl out of a friend's window and all sit on the roof over her porch. There could be 8 or 10 of us out there. No one called the cops. When her mum saw us - after quite a long time of us doing that- she looked up at us, laughed, and told us if we fell through the roof it was our own damn faults."

People think I'm standoffish or rude, but I'm really not (at least most of the time). I just can't tell if someone is on my deaf side!"

childfree,fc0rcro,t3_efd4r1,1577297785.0,"You absolutely should have a scene - what she did was unbelievably unprofessional and rude and not acting in your beat interests. She wasn't doing her job and you called her on it. I'm so proud of you for standing up for yourself, that takes a lot of strength, especially when you're already flustered.

Please, report this doctor. To anyone and everyone you can. Make sure your regular doctor knows in no uncertain terms what you dealt with. And demand your money back for the visit since you were not treated for your complaint.

I'm so sorry this happened to you."

dogs,f95iyv5,t3_e3ud3y,1575128769.0,"Yep! We rescued an Italian greyhound-boxer mix as a tiny puppy (we didn't know how young he actually was) about 3 years after we adopted an American dingo-corgi mix. The older dog had already raised a baby cat - who thinks he is a dog after being raised by a dog - so he fell into his teaching spot immediately. The puppy learned all his basic commands, silly ass behaviors, how to play from his big brother. Older dog will still put the puppy in his place if he acts out, and we've had the puppy for 3 years now."
