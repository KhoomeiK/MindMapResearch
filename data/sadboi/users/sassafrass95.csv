FitnessGirls,fihymur,t3_f7uv40,1582415497.0,Are you sure that isn’t bloat? I have IBS and the bloat tends to be on the bottom half of my stomach. Looks exactly the same.
CasualConversation,fibbdoe,t3_f77wnk,1582318423.0,"I'm so happy for you! But, just wanted to suggest 2 CRUCIAL things in your recovery.

1. GO TO THERAPY. I don't care what anyone says, it IS worth the money and is the single best thing you can do for yourself. I don't know where I would be without my therapist.
2. Look into alternative depression treatments. By alternative, I mean disassociatives/psychedelics. I've done ketamine infusions for my depression and it's changed my life. Visit the subreddit r/TherapeuticKetamine for more info.

PM me if you ever want to talk. I'll always be there. All the best."

The only way I’ve been able to keep myself together is by holding it all in at work and around friends so no one sees me suffering. I think no one seeing it, makes them either forget or think that I’m ok which I am NOT. I’m a fucking mess, but I think people will just think I’m a lunatic if I say as much. I wish the best for you. Just know you’re not a lone."

Do you have any tips/tricks to push it out? I’ve drank ginger tea to help in the past, but isn’t working this time."

You deserve this."

AcademicPsychology,fdomoza,t1_fdom3dw,1578608278.0,"This made me smile. It’s good to feel like I’m not alone. I think I’m gathering the assumption that IO isn’t helpful because I work at a place with a decent culture. I just find office life to be a complete waste of a life. 
Psychologists are sometimes contracted to do work at my firm and they mainly do “executive coaching” which is basically just making successful, rich, privileged men even more successful. This is what I’m trying to avoid. I’ll broaden my perspective a little bit and try to see outside my bubble."
AcademicPsychology,fdohacq,t1_fdoh5ym,1578605128.0,"I’ve definitely thought about it and I think given my background that I’d have a huge advantage, but I already made a compromise by my first career choice and don’t want to do that again. I want to help others and I don’t see how I can do that with IO."
Anxiety,fcw411g,t3_ej29di,1578016646.0,"Literally JUST had this conversation with my brother. I’m 24 and I just finished up my first real year of work and WTF. I just can’t stand it. I don’t do anything meaningful that makes any impact on anyone. I make money that I have NO time to spend on experiences, just random crap I don’t need to give me some kind of rush.

I’m really looking into a career change. Will blow my brains out if I keep doing this with no end in sight."

AskReddit,f9kbh7t,t1_f9hrb8j,1575396948.0,I had the EXACT same issue.. no other drug has ever really done it for me the way that addy does. Think I calculated it once and spent about $10k on it in 3 years. Still miss that feeling.

Most western countries stay out of issues that are not their own and spend their budget on domestic issues, not issues abroad. I though this was common sense."
