I was peer pressured into lgbtphobia, and also peer pressured out of it, at an age young enough where my beliefs were still quite malleable. If I grew up in, say, Alabama for example, I'd probably have *organized* a few anti-lgbt+ events by now. Being a part of the community you're spitting on just adds to the spicy self loathing factor.

If you want to debate about this kind of topic (I'm not discouraging it, but please know your audience), please do it on a more appropriate subreddit, like r/opinions, one of the political subreddits, or even r/LGBDropTheT, where you'll probably find more people like you to share your opinions with. Not here though, because as you already said, it's just a bunch of 12-year-olds, which, pardon me if I sound rude, why would you care about *their* opinion anyway? Why would you care about anyone in this thread's opinion? Heck, why would you care about Reddit's opinion at all? It's a left-leaning social media platform that excels in reposting specific images about pop culture, not an accurate representation of how ""society has turned to dogs"" or whatever.
