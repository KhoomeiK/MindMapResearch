I was here when those meta posts were happening, and to be honest I think the people who were complaining had very legitimate points.  I also remember one mod in particular who told me my trauma wasn't legitimate because I don't believe in trigger warnings.  That person is still a mod. 

I was bothered by the fact that you banned meta posts, but dropped it because I assumed that you would be banning *all* meta posts.  Now I'm unhappy again because it's clear you just weren't willing to accept criticism.

- *Borderline personality is associated with longstanding impulsivity and affective instability, including rage reactions. Therefore, one would suspect that more impulsive and violent offenders might be diagnosed with this disorder. Data seem to support these impressions.* [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790397/).

- *This study tested the hypothesis that borderline personality characterizes extreme violence by assessing features of borderline and schizotypal personality in three groups...Borderline traits associated with extreme violence consisted of unstable, intense relationships and affective instability... It is concluded that borderline personality may predispose toward extreme forms of violence.* [Source](https://urlzs.com/8oECm)

- *Several findings emphasize the high prevalence of aggression in BPD: 73% of BPD patients have engaged in aggressive behavior over the course of a year [3], 58% are “occasionally or often” involved in physical fights, and 25% have used a weapon against others ([2], p.154). BPD patients constitute a major proportion of prison inmates, with prevalence rates of 30% [4]. Increased aggression in BPD has been found using both categorical [5-7] and dimensional measurements [8-11] of BPD symptomatology, and may thus be regarded as a core feature of the disorder [12,13].* [Source] (https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-015-0028-7).

It's believed that people with BPD have extremely strong emotions, stronger than the average by far.  As a result of that, they struggle to function well in a society that is designed for people who don't feel as much.  So for example think of a giant trying to live in a world built for little people.  

So as a result of being disabled in that way, people with BPD have an extremely difficult time functioning properly, and as a result they end up using coping mechanisms that work for them (self harm, explosive temper, etc.) in the short term, but cause them big problems in the long term. They struggle to explain themselves to people because other people don't have the inner experiences to understand why something so small can seem so big, etc.  They just think we're being dramatic. This obviously just makes things worse because now you're a giant living in a little world and people are making demands of you but you can't complete tasks because you're always knocking things down and breaking them and when you try to explain it's because you're gigantic everybody says ""no you're not just get it done.""

 Those articles you find on google are written for like $2USD by people in Indonesia who have never even heard of BPD.  As someone who works in marketing, I can't even begin to tell you how corrupt the online content industry is.  Sites like The Mighty etc. are nothing but click farms.

I am going to write a post on this some day, explaining exactly how awful Google is for finding good information and why you should never ever trust an internet article on a page that has ads."
BPD,eqte1h5,t1_eqrfxa4,1560309637.0,Maybe you could describe what happens?  I'm kinda curious.
BPD,eqr3mmb,t1_eqqzb2f,1560246370.0,Cause you've mentioned being manic a time or two and that's a medical emergency and also this is a BPD forum not bipolar so I was just curious.  If you're manic and have a baby you should go to the ER immediately.
mentalhealth,eqqx303,t3_bz8t0e,1560236301.0,That sounds like a panic attack.
mentalhealth,eqqveoh,t3_bz8w81,1560234197.0,"Hi, I work in mental health and review therapist notes all the time.  At least here in California, therapists pretty much never put any of your personal information like abuse details in their notes.  This is industry standard.  Session notes are completely clinical and extremely boring and most people's notes look pretty similar.

Furthermore, explicit details about your abuse won't help your SSI case."

BPD,eqoe470,t3_byz7a7,1560187471.0,"Okay I'm going to hit this one line by line because basically every sentence in this post pisses me right off. Let's go. 

>You are NOT in the right for thinking or saying that everyone in the world is selfish and terrible

You are not in the right for telling anyone what they should think and say. Furthermore, if you want to get philosophical on this topic, there are plenty of sensible, reasonable and rational minds who would disagree with you.  As a Hobbesian myself, (one who is recovered I'll have you know), there is plenty of good reason to believe that the world is fundamentally a bad place.  But if you spend more than half a second thinking about it, you might come to realize that that worldview is completely and utterly compatible with a happy and meaningful life. I'm sorry that you were not capable of noticing that on your own.

>telling yourself that you are a piece of shit or that you sound like a narcissist is NOT and excuse for you going out of your line just to say this in a group already for traumatized/mentally hurt people meant for SUPPORT.

Everyone is responsible *for their own feelings* and NO ONE ELSE'S.  Honestly how dare you suggest that the reason I can't say what I'm thinking is because it might upset somebody else.  Perhaps if someone is easily ""triggered"" (I hate that word but that's a post for another day), then they should stay the hell off of message boards populated with people who have a disorder characterized by suicidal ideation, self harm, extreme emotional dysregulation and severe interpersonal problems.

>I'm seeing ""vent"" posts which are commented by people who only are agreeing and are not in any shape or form questioning OPs thoughts.

That's why they are labeled vent posts.  They are literally labeled to describe what they are.

>We as a support group need to remind EACHOTHER to try and stop this constant ""Black and white"" view of the world and on ourselves. We as BPD people need to remind eachother NOT to view everything in black and white and instead remind eachother of the different shades of gray our world is coated in.

Do you know what validation is?  Because we need that, too.  How about we give people what they ask for and not what we think they need because we're not chartered psychologists and the last thing we need is to start thinking we are.

>We can not let our emotional pain drown our minds and stop us from truly experiance the life that we want! 

Who made you the boss of r/bpd?  Perhaps you need to radically accept that many people are not in the same head space that you are at the moment and asinine platitudes such as the ones contained in this post are going to do nothing but piss them off.

>Our diagnosis is already stigmatized enough, we can not let one of the few ""safe zones"" for us be used as a source of ""validation"". 

Um, actually people can use this sub for whatever the hell they want as long as it follows the rules and it's none of your damn business whether or not it is actually curative, which OBVIOUSLY it is not.  Everybody knows that online support forums are cancer. You're a bit late to the station if you think that comment is some kind of hot take.

>The least we can do is to once in a while remind eachother that the world is in gray rather in black and white. Because that is all this condition does to us. Makes us in a constant switch between black and white.

Hey OP I need to tell you - the world is not black and white.  Maybe you need to understand that this is a forum with thousands of users with different needs and different experiences and just because you see a lot of negative posts doesn't mean that we need you to bust in with your patronizing pep talk about how we all need to behave the way you'd like us to. There are lots of very positive posts on this sub.  I guess that pesky black and white thinking of yours is clouding your mind."
BPD,eqh9bjo,t1_eqfpm7w,1560052315.0,Advice still stands.  You are way overthinking this.
BPD,eqf0xt2,t3_by8y42,1560013216.0,It's work.  Just be polite and mind your own business. You are way overthinking this.
BipolarReddit,eqa8h17,t1_eq71w3s,1559927607.0,">How does one begin the process of training your brain to think differently? 

You're not training it to think differently.  You're training it to focus more attention on the things going on in the world outside your mind.

>I can sit and focus on all the things or specific minuscule things happening around me, but the anxious, frustrated thoughts don't go away.

That's because you've spent your whole life just letting your mind run non stop, so it literally does not know how to do anything else.  

Mindfulness isn't the practice of emptying your mind of thoughts, it's the practice of noticing your mind having thoughts and turning your attention back to the present

You're never going to get yourself to the point where you can just sit there with a completely empty mind for hours.  You're simply taking some time each day to pay attention to the fact that your mind runs non stop all the time, and trying to divert that attention focused inward to the outside world."
