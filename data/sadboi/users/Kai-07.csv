WritingHub,fqg92zd,t1_fqg8gbh,1589340632.0,"But then that creates the conundrum of why a good/pure person was needed that doesn't involve her soul being devoured.
Maybe the demon is a demon of jealousy, and the witch had jealous feelings toward the queen that it fed on and amplified. So she was kinda sorta forced but didn't fight back hard enough, and jealousy is a crappy reason to harm someone so that she can still be blamed.

I think I like that idea. Do you think that would be controversial enough?"

Like the answer might have crippled her or degraded her quality of life, but it wouldn't have caused anyone to die. It would have to be pretty severe to be forgivable,  but not *too* forgivable. 

I was also thinking maybe the demon had something what she wanted, something she couldn't obtain otherwise, and the price was to curse the queen. Though I wonder why the demon would want the queen specifically, and it can't have her soul for reasons later in the story. Unless maybe her soul is trapped...? Hmm."
WritingHub,fqg7a3t,t1_fqg5iyr,1589339497.0,"Hmm, the witch being forced doesn't have much room to justify executing her. Prince A and H aren't unreasonable people. 

There needs to be a situation where the witch bears a good bit of the responsibility for the spell being cast to justify execution while also having enough good intentions/remorse or what have you to also have a good reason to spare her.
