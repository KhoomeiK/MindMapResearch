aspd,fqyb8m4,t1_fqy57ty,1589745785.0,"The way your dad reacted, that’s exactly how I expect my mother to be. After the many diagnosis I have been given before they narrowed it down, she refused to acknowledge there was anything wrong with me and that the psychiatrist was wrong about every one of them. The only one she really ever believed was depression. I’m quite sure she suffers with a pd as well. It definitely made growing up with mental illness a lot harder than it had to be."
aspd,fqw1kid,t1_fqtjlsp,1589690334.0,"I was diagnosed at age 15, and at that time my symptoms were quite extreme. But now at age 21, I don’t really notice it much anymore. I most likely still have it, but it is possible that my symptoms have calmed down enough that I may not completely fit the criteria anymore. I’m not sure exactly how it works. I have done some research and found that there are quite a few people out there with both ASPD and BPD, and that the disorders share more similarities than I expected. But I still have a lot more research to do. It’s getting tedious and annoying, but It’s important for me to know what’s going on inside my head."
aspd,fqw0htv,t1_fqt68v1,1589689531.0,"It was confusing for me too. I didn’t even think one could be diagnosed with both. But after some research, I’ve read that it happens more than you’d think, and that the disorder have more in common than I expected. I still have to lot more to learn, but at least I know I’m not some mutant clusterfuck of insanity. I think."
aspd,fqw09i5,t1_fqvl5pw,1589689363.0,"I find it interesting you brought up sensory issues. Before my diagnosis with ASPD, I was almost misdiagnosed with Aspergers because of my sensory processing issues. You made a lot of great points about how a lot of the “symptoms” I’ve read about are more targeted towards the people around me than myself. I’ve never really thought about that before.

As for my BPD diagnosis, I was diagnosed at 15 years old after being admitted for a month to a residential assessment centre. I had no clue what it was, but now that I’m older and have done countless hours/days/months of research, I realized why I was the way I was. Constantly doing dangerous things that could hurt me without a second thought, actually wanting to suffer consequences of my actions. It was harsh. It manifested into a fentanyl addiction but other than that, I’ve calmed down drastically since then.

I considered telling my boyfriend over messenger, but I think if I did that he would be upset with me. So I’m going to call him on discord and kind of slowly ease into the subject of my diagnosis. I trust that he will be understanding (he understood whenever I had BPD episodes and those were messy) when I tell him, and will be willing to put effort into understanding. As for my family, including my mother, I will not be telling them. It will just make my life so much harder. She already doesn’t trust me so I can’t imagine what would happen if she found out her daughter is a sociopath. Man it would be a mess.

Thanks for this by the way, it’s helped me out and has definitely calmed my frustration for having to deal with all of this. Hope you’re well and being safe. Thanks again!"
aspd,fqstdox,t1_fqs2cy3,1589618169.0,"Thanks for this. I appreciate how in depth you went with the impairments people with ASPD deal with. It’s a lot to take in, and I do still have many more things to learn, but this sub seems like a good place to start.

There is one thing I’m still wondering though, if you’re willing to answer. If I were to tell someone about me having this disorder, how would you suggest I go about it (or which way that you’ve done it worked out best)? I have a boyfriend I’d like to tell. I feel like him knowing might make things easier for me in the relationship. I just have no damn idea how I would even do it."
aspd,fqrzjsn,t1_fqruv9t,1589595264.0,"Yes that’s what I was thinking as well. What I meant by  “too much effort” is having the ability to feel empathy. It seems like many people use up so much energy on being empathetic and sympathetic towards others and I’m not sure if I’d want that. I guess if it was only for a bit, that would be interesting. Being able to feel emotions properly would be a cool experience. But forever, I don’t think so. I have been recently diagnosed, but hopefully this answer is more what you were looking for. Be safe and you also have a good day (:"
aspd,fqrw224,t3_gj21tn,1589593111.0,"Throughout my life I’ve made a habit of lying. It started off with me not wanting my parents to know anything bad I’ve done as a child, but it quickly became so fast and easy I’d lie about anything without a second thought. 

Now that I’m an adult, I’ll say that my lying hasn’t gotten better so much as the things I lie about have changed. As a kid I’d lie about the silliest things. Now as an adult, I find myself keeping huge secrets from others instead of silly white lies, which in my opinion is worse.

If it weren’t for the quarantine I’d probably still be going out and using. It sure does kill my boredom and I’ve always enjoyed getting into trouble, so there isn’t much to lose.

There are a lot of differences from one experience to the next, so what may be great advice to you may be insensitive to the next person. Just try to remember this sub is for emotionally unwell and suicidal individuals such as me and (and maybe you), but we all don’t function the same.

But I do thank you for putting so much effort into trying to help others see the beauty in life that you have seen, and encouraging others to partake in healthy habits. It does not go unappreciated.
