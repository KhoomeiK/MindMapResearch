The dangerous part is especially if you are young and don't show serious symptoms, cause then you are a carrier without even realizing it. Starbucks isn't a necessity, it's a McDonald's for coffee and it's disgusting how we are still open basically putting our selves and everyone else at a major risk by straight up ignoring science and not practicing social distancing.
