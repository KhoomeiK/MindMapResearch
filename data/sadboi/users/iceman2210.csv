Go as deep as you can and then short in and out slow strokes while your making out. Keep as much weight on her pelvis, almost locking her in position. Dont stop till you feel like your gonna blow, then switch up the position. Go doggy and start deep, go slow but much longer thrusts then switch up the speed and go faster, still feeling every inch of her. Youll find the groove and just have fun with it."

As far as Im concerned its the key to happiness in all facets of life. Truly believe that everything no matter how hard it gets, is going to be ok."
