Yes, I used to get hit as a child, but now I'm in charge of who hits me when and how. You'll find in proper bdsm, the bottom/submissive is really the one in charge. You can use these scenes with a trusted partner to really take control of your past and move forward. I often struggle with a lot of the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse I went through, but having someone I trust put me through the ropes and then take care of me afterwards is extremely cathartic and has helped me feel more confident."

I dont know how I'm going to navigate the adult world on my own for the first time ever. Every time I ask my mom for advice she blows me off then cries that she misses me and wants me to come back but if she cant answer a few questions for me over the phone then what in earth does she have for me there?
