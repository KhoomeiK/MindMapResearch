while its dumb for people to sign responsibility of non habitable repairs  , you are correct that its way dumber for landlords to do it , and the only one who can decide who is and is not right , is that particular judge , of whom we are not  .

>. It is not always clear that a landlordâ€™s failure to maintain constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. A court will decide this on a case-by-case basis


>. Generally, if a unit falls into disrepair but still meets basic living requirements, the court will find that the landlord has not breached the warranty. Serious housing code violations, lack of adequate heat, serious rodent infestation, or extremely unsafe utilities or appliances are examples of factors upon which courts will base a finding that the implied warranty of habitability has been breached

>There is no situation in which a lease can specify terms that go against the law. If the law states, for example, that a landlord cannot bill water usage in a multi-family building wth a shared meter, the landlord writing in the lease that water will be billed does not make the action legal.

you dont know if thats in the others' leases. that literally only means YOU cant be a disturbance , and it sounds like you are being a disturbance. 

its very simple. if you were a landlord would you rather kick out the , at least , several rent paying tenants and find new ones , or the one tenant being a pain in the ass about everyone else. 

the landlord is not responsible for the behaviors of others , in fact , that clause of your lease is entirely unenforceable. 

you could go ahead and push back on this with your landlord , if you are a big enough pain in the ass they will probably be willing to settle to let you out

next time visit a property randomly and at night for your due diligence , and dont sign anything like that again , its not enforceable on other people"

.where do you live  ?

ApartmentHacks,fqu5qoq,t1_fqu304v,1589652549.0,"that's not really how things work. the landlord is required to mitigate his damages by getting someone to take over your spot asap. once he does that then you are released from further obligation. 

you can help by advertising your place , see if theres any interest right now to time your departure better so theres less time you will be paying for a vacant space. 

or , you can see of your landlord would be willing to negotiate a buy out so you can pay a flat fee to break the lease as opposed to the wait and see method. landlords never put top priority attention in mitigating damages on a broken lease for obvious reasons. 

and lastly , if you do go the mitigation route , i suggest you dont pay anything until the landlord fills that space , and try to pay close attention to when you see someone has moved in, and settle up at that time."

Oh No!, in an instant completely out of nowhere totally unexpectedly without any warning Fog has appeared and now visibility is 0. What should I do

if you feel it necessary to *stop your fucking car* in the middle of the highway you should immedeately pull completely off the road , then stop and dont cause *everyone immedeately behind you* to slam into the back of your car. 

>Okay, so fog of this nature is rare in my area - although we sometimes get thick fog, you can usually see it coming. But we know, if the visibility suddenly cuts, you SLOW DOWN so that your stopping distance is within your visibility distance again. Sudden fog = EVERYONE immediately slows right down = no crashes or those that occur happen at a very slow speed with fairly minimal damage and injuries.

no. you keep fucking moving , or pull off the road . 

>The argument many people here seem to be making is that everyone else is probably going to continue to drive like an idiot at incredibly unsafe speeds, therefore I should as well...

no again. you cant control anyone else on the road , and if you are totally cool with being smashed from behind at full speed on the highway , by all means , slam those fucking breaks in the middle of the go lane . and hopefully you live long enough to collect that sweet sweet settlement.
