The way to do this, is simply to do it. Pretty much say what you said here, but try no to make excuses.  I know if I received a sincere note from a friend I haven't heard from, I would react in kindness.

Something like ""Dear Mary, I've missed you and know that even though you have not heard from me, I think of you often.  My illness has prevented me to conduct myself in a way that I want to.  I realize it was extremely rude of me, and my husband, to never properly thank you for taking care of our dog for us.  I am truly sorry and know that your kindness is very much appreciated.

This note is very late and long overdue.  I hope you reconnect with you soon.  Here are the dates/times I'm available.  if none works, please propose a few and we will make it work!"""
