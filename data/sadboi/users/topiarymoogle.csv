Blake twice says that Sun was following her. We know she knows what stalking is, she calls Adam out on it in Volume 6. 

>*""You stalked me across Anima, I want nothing to do with you!""* 

But with Sun, twice she mentions he followed her home.

>*""Have you been following me?!""*   
>  
> ""*He just kind of followed me home*.""

Blake's a big girl, she has self-agency and can tell someone when what they're doing is fucked up. And she does. Blake tells people exactly what's on her mind, we've seen that when she calls Weiss a spoiled brat.

If Sun was stalking her, she would've called it out as such. She had two chances to, but she didn't. She even lets him stay at her home. I think if Blake actually felt like Sun was stalking her, she very easily could've told her parents or dealt with it herself.

She thanks him multiple times for what he did, too.

>*""You showed me that sometimes you need to be there for a friend even when they don't want you to be. I was drowning in guilt and fear, I tried to push you away, but you didn't give up on me.""*

fnki,fpcczh6,t1_fpc6zdg,1588495906.0,">*""So first you said that Bumbleby was rushed...""*

It is. As Miles Luna himself said, Blake and Yang's relationship in the beginning of Volume 6 was nowhere near as close as it was to the start of the show. As he stated:

>""We know we wanted Blake and Yang to have a reconciliation. We start the volume on amicable terms, but they are nowhere near as close as they were at the start, and we wanted to slowly build back up their relationship. Get them back to the buds we saw in Volume 3, getting ramen and stuff. ""

So they're not as close as they were in Volume 3, they're still on rough terms. Add that to the fact that Blake fumbled over her words in Volume 6 and offended Yang by saying she'd ""protect her"", it shouldn't have gone from ""we need build back up their relationship"" to ""now we're holding hands at every turn"". Their relationship went from ""amicable terms"" to ""are they dating now?"" and that's where I feel things were rushed.

After that, they go to Altas, and they barely have a moment away from each other. They fight together, go dancing together, tell Robyn the truth together, fight Elm and Vine together... at this point, if now they're this close and constantly giving shy glances at each other and aren't leaving each other's side... just stop the baiting and say they're dating now. They might as well be, as they're doing literally everything together now. 

Bumbleby is held to a different standard (not really) because Bumbleby didn't get the explicit development that Arkos and Renora did. You're telling me back when episodes were 5 minutes long in earlier volumes, that Arkos and Renora and even Blacksun could get explicit moments, but Bumbleby couldn't? No, I don't believe that. Am I really supposed to believe that Bumbleby's moments are supposedly more ""subtle"" in the earlier volumes, and that *that* was planned? I don't buy that either.

I don't really count Ren and Nora as anything other than a ship, because they are barely characters outside of each other. But Arkos got a full training arc together and it was made clear from the first glance that Pyrrha was interested in Jaune. They made it explicitly clear in earlier volumes that Sun was interested in Blake (V1), Pyrrha in Jaune (V1), Weiss in Neptune (V2), and Nora in Ren (V1). So why couldn't they have done the same for Yang and Blake? At what point in the earlier volumes did Blake show explicit and clear interest in Yang? And same for Yang to Blake? There is not moment in the earlier volumes where viewers can unanimously state, ""Okay, here's the exact moment we know that Blake likes Yang/Yang likes Blake""."
fnki,fpc4rc6,t1_fpbhr6p,1588487575.0,He's definitely coming back in the Vacuo arc. It couldn't have been more obviously foreshadowed when he told Blake that he had a feeling she hadn't seen the last of him.
fnki,fpc4oc2,t1_fpc4avn,1588487497.0,"Yeah, no. 

Having Blacksun be a relationship during Volumes 4 and 5 wouldn't have made sense either. Blake was dealing with the WF factions trying to kill her and her family and attack Haven.

Blake hasn't had time to breathe in ages. Volume 4 and 5 was her taking down the old White Fang and helping her dad start a new movement, while Volume 6 was her travelling with RWBY to get the relic to safety. She hasn't had time, period.

However, Renora's become canon through all of this chaos. I mean, if they found time to share a kiss at a political rally, I'm not sure why the Bees couldn't be shown confirming their relationship as well."

Although I do agree that both were set up to be possible, and RT just went with Bumbleby, I don't agree with a lot of things in that video. The fact is, it's fine if both ships were set up, but Blacksun should've had better closure if it's been shut down.
