Where were her kids on Mother‚Äôs Day while their dad was away on business. Why would she ride a bike alone on Mother‚Äôs Day in this case? Were Suzanne and the neighbor best friends? I dunno.

tifu,fr5ms4u,t3_gmhtel,1589911141.0,"Just some perspective from the opposite sex. My husband, like so many men, thinks all women have to have a giant donkey dick in them to get fulfilled. It‚Äôs simply not true. Size doesn‚Äôt matter as much as you think. Yea a big dick is nice to look at, just like a huge set of tits probably are for most guys. This doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt attracted to or wanna play with your wife (or girlfriends) B cups any less. I prefer a nice average size penis and I have a tiny vibrator. For me, it‚Äôs all about clitoral stimulation, not penetration. A lot of men just don‚Äôt get this. Perfect your tongue and finger technique and be sure you can last in the sack as long as she can to ensure she gets satisfaction. That is the best advice I can give. 

It‚Äôs so understandable to feel less than or self conscious if you don‚Äôt look like you really want to. You gotta work with what you got and be confident. Your girlfriend loves you and is okay with your size or she‚Äôd of left when she first saw your ding dong."

stepparents,fpkdbj7,t3_gdw7xw,1588692601.0,"I wish I had known so many things before getting into this life of mine but mainly, I should‚Äôve paid more attention to the relationship my husband has with his ex wife. They are very close. It‚Äôs awesome, and could be worse so don‚Äôt get me wrong but I struggled a lot with the fear of them wanting to get back together since they have such a good relationship. I wasn‚Äôt ready to deal with the dynamic that I finally feel over now, and feel I wasted some good years holding contempt and worry I shouldn‚Äôt of had in the first place. 

Second, I did blend my family. I have a daughter and he has two he gets every other week like clockwork as well. His girls are very spoiled by the other parent and grandparent. My daughter has no support from her fathers side and only sees her dad twice a month. This causes major issues with jealousy/keeping things fair/inferiority complex/etc. I try to keep things fair but feel my husbands kids have better things in general than my daughter does and it just hurts me cause there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. 

Third, make and keep boundaries if you like having things that are only yours to use. I feel like I have to keep my things under lock and key at times cause they just simply have no respect for my stuff sometimes. They feel everything is theirs while they are here. This is probably my biggest peeve but it‚Äôs this way with kids in general. 

I‚Äôm struggling a lot right now with life, sorry I got off topic. Keep communicating and you will make it. Don‚Äôt keep quiet just to keep the peace cause you won‚Äôt feel the peace while everyone else will. Love those kids like they are your own and when they hug you and tell you goodnight or that they love you, or celebrate you for Mother‚Äôs Day or your birthday, etc the stress and resentment can melt off just like that. That is why I‚Äôm still here in this, it makes it worth it."

It makes me physically ill that a mother could entertain for a moment! the thought her 15 yr old daughter would consent to a relationship with her husband. A mother‚Äôs intuition is strong. If you are this suspicious, something is going on in some way. Protect your daughter from him. If she won‚Äôt talk, make him talk or send him packing til someone can clue you in to what‚Äôs happening in your own home. Maybe therapy? She is probably petrified of being blamed or not believed by you. In my case, my step dad started pitting me and my mom against one another so he could be my ‚Äúally‚Äù that I could run to for comfort while fighting with my mom. He touched me in the night twice til I got up the courage to tell.
