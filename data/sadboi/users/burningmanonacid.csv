So, as long as something soft is used and he just lightly holds something over the infants nose and mouth, it wouldn't be abnormal for it to be declared SIDS.

dating,fqs0e4q,t1_fqqscjg,1589595783.0,"It is for a few reasons: 

1. Most people are not not straight. Straight is the majority sexuality, so the chances of putting a guy out there and getting a woman willing to have sex with a woman too is lesser than if you know she is willing to have sex with a woman. So, the chances of a woman then being bi over lesbian is the only issue. No need to worry that she isn't into women at all. 
2. Women are less intimidating. They almost always send the woman to the first meeting or have you speak to the woman because it is easier to talk about that stuff woman to woman vs. woman to man and woman. 
3. Also, not to be that person, but the male is usually not very attractive. I have personally seen like 2 couples where the male was actually attractive, but they put his face out there too. They didn't hide anything at all and pretty much all photos were together. Most of them are men less attractive than the woman who is shoved into one blurry photo at the end. Women can put on make up or fake angles or whatever to entice people into coming to a threesome, but a man doesn't have the same advantage so if he is ugly... he is just ugly.

So whatever. I think it is important to keep around to show how far we have come. 

Modern ones, I get more angry when they shoehorn the themes I disagree with. I beta read a ton and some people definitely have an agenda. Once I saw an author write an author's note at the beginning explaining in no uncertain terms his political beliefs and their affects on the book. However, I will appreciate that 1000 times more than someone shoehorning them in at the end or trying to disguise their agenda throughout. We all have opinions, they color everything we write.

1. Not write an LGBT character in for your own safety. Perfectly acceptable and only a vocal minority would be angry about it. Fact of the matter is: if romance isn't discussed, then sexuality likely won't come up. I am bisexual and my manager literally thought I was a lesbian for two whole years before we one day had a talk and I said something. I've had friends for a year and then they're like ""I have a boyfriend now"" and I think ""Oh... I guess it never came up they are gay..."" It happens. If someone wants a character to be a sexuality, they can believe they are that sexuality in their own head. 
2. You can publish it in English in a way that is USA or UK centric and use a fake, very american/British sounding name. Maybe no one will know. 

It is really up to you. You shouldn't feel that you have to risk personal safety in order to add representation.

Writeresearch,fqkdlan,t3_gj7rwk,1589425087.0,"Well OP as someone with many disorders myself, any disorder can have anger as a symptom but how it is expressed is what differs. 

Even my OCD will cause angry outbursts but those usually originate in frustration and they can very easily be reversed by removing the irritant. For example, my OCD is tied almost entirely to food. In my brain there are foods that can touch and foods that cannot and if someone tries to make me eat a mixture of should not mix food, I will get really upset and pissy. I'm not gonna call anyone names or flip tables or anything but if I am not quick to check myself I will definitely be unpleasant. 


My bipolar though has anger from depression. This is expressed more so through the need for constant attention and any rejection of spending time together is as if they are rejecting me as a person entirely. So, again I am self aware and practiced enough to not behave like this usually but ofc this is lifelong and I can only try my hardest, I will immediately cut them off. If I was less conscious and less in control, I would literally never speak to them again and feel nothing about it. 

I could go on with my paranoia and panic disorders or my PTSD, but you get the idea. Again, I want to say I dont behave like this anymore with the exception, but thats how I would when I didn't know something was wrong. He could have intermittent explosive disorder which would be closer to true anger or he could just be abusive which would also be closest to true anger. 

As others say of course, most people with mental disorders arent violent and most abusers don't have mental disorders."

Of course not every environment is characterized. Some just exist. 

But from a scholarly literary standpoint, anything can become a character. It's how you treat it. Any other definition is wrong because there's established published stories from the perspective of everything from aliens to humans to environment to inanimate objects to god to death to animals.

Writeresearch,fqh8d6w,t3_gislqv,1589370915.0,"So i am not schizophrenic, but i am on the scale with a schizo aspect to my bipolar and I take medications geared towards schizophrenia. 

First, if he quits cold turkey it is hell. A really common schizophrenic/bipolar medication is quetiapine, which is what i took regularly. I went from 300mg, give or take 100mg, to just nothing. First, it's a pretty miserable drug. It zaps your energy and for me, it made me so tired I would see and hear hallucinations really intensely for about 10 minutes before it knocked me out. Well i hated this, my hallucinations are mostly auditory anyway so fuck that. After a year of taking it I quit suddenly. 

With prescription meds, you can go through withdrawal the same as a crack addict does. That's why all those drug commercials say ""consult doctor before stopping"" because it is hell. I first of all couldn't sleep that night. I laid there sweating. Second, I felt that right before you puke feeling but never puked. Third, i seriously thought i was gonna die or at least live like this forever. And last, my hallucinations got worse. I'd say this all lasted for 48 hours, then I was fine but I learned my lesson that I will never ever do that again. 

The hallucinations calmed down immediately after that too as they tend to get worse when I'm stressed. Paranoia sunk in first. Definitely went back to my paranoid habits after that and also created new ones. With paranoia (therefore stress) increasing, so did my other symptoms such as secluding myself and hallucinations. 

Probably took a week before i was back to how I was before I took the medications. 

You really dont have to be too careful how you write this as with all mental illness, how people go off is different. However that withdrawal will almost certainly happen if she has taken them for longer than 9 months regularly."

Even hallucinogens which will last longer than a lot of uppers will only rarely be prolonged. So by time they start tripping, get a bad enough trip that they need to go to the hospital, check in and then the doctor finds out what drug it is, a decent amount if time should have passed. 

If due to his paranoia, he is swinging and angry, he may be sedated. However, all other care will be to monitor the condition. People come down soon enough plus if they're an addict they can go through withdrawal after they come down. Ive never been a drug addict, just witnessed a lot, but I've heavily over used a prescription out of necessity for a year, then decided I didn't want it anymore so i stopped cold turkey. To say it is bad is a grave understatement. So care will aim to prevent the person from experiencing the after affects of possible withdrawal, or some psychedelics and extended uses of cocaine, meth, fentanyl, etc. Can cause long term mental issues for the user. Care will try to assess what to do for them after they come down and to help them come down gracefully by providing plenty of liquids.
