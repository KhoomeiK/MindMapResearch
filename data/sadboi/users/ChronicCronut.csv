I was in the second year of a 3-year IT-course when this happened. It was me and a few friends of mine. We were in a networking lesson and everyone in class had their own individual Linux computer with different passwords taped to them. We coded on linux terminal. We coded a script that opened up any website in any amount.

As the 15 minute break came around, the teacher went out for some coffee and the other students did their own thing.

And shortly after they left, one of my friends left the computer logged on as he left to use the bathroom and the rest of us we started that script and typed in 'pornhub.com 10' or something like that and 10 tabs of pornhub opened up."
