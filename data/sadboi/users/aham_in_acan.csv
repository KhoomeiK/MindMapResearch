a dream I had where I was ushering a group of small children into a cellar because there was a tornado, and with a sudden burst of rage I intentionally pushed a little boy (6 or so) down some stairs and into a deep hole. He hit his head, and looked up at me and his eyeballs were blood red and he cried out, “all I see is blood’” it was very scary.

The second was where I was in the church I grew up in (Pentecostal) and as part of some sort of ritual, everyone was cutting themselves open and trading organs and muscles. I took a knife and cut open the top of my thigh and tugged out my quadricep. I handed it off to a stranger and replaced mine with theirs. It was quite bloody, but it didn’t hurt.
