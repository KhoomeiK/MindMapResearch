Mainly because all the items they don't accept and users don't request back, those are what gets sold in the rescue boxes. So they are still making a profit on everything regardless if YOU the seller see any of that $. I also make sure to send in the biggest box packed full that I possibly can. So it is worth the $10.99 to have my unlisted items sent back. I have been doing this for about two years now and by far make the most $ from ThredUP per item vs Poshmark or anywhere else that I sell. Another thing is, make sure you are sourcing the cheapest prices you possibly can. I don't even set foot in a thrift store unless they are having a GOOD sale, like 75%-90% off items, or 50 cents per item. Bigger profit margins that way.
