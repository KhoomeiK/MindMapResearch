I feel no need to hide myself around anyone, if I were to scream, jump, or run around, I will and nobody will stop me. No matter what my teachers say. Many students do find me annoying, but I learned to accept it in a way.

I used to be really hurt when others rejected me from their social groups because of how they often perceived me as immature. But it will continue, and so I gave up on my social life and focused more on my personal happiness. People in fact do see meas more charming that way!"

mentalhealth,erjtzgh,t3_c2dqf7,1560946819.0,"I wish I knew how to help. If you keep looking for what makes you happy, you might end up feeling like  you're empty or that it will forever be missing.

I hate to suggest socialising because though it can make some of us feel great it can also make us feel even more withdrawn.

I'm not bipolar but I was once disconnected for an entire year, flat out emotionless, unwilling to socialise, move, and I was desparate to feel anything. 

Music no longer brought me happiness
Interaction no longer brought me happiness
Existence in itself no longer brought me happiness


I learned that I was alone, and that I must deal with this alone. Research, abandon everyone, you are your own master and better yet everyone's master, be powerful. 

If you beleive in a truth spread it
No matter how agressive or defensive others get 
Stand for your ground

Develop a sense of identity, and let everyone know that you're better than them 


Maybe try getting a pet to care for? Though I'm not sure on how this may help as you're a male and the female and male got very different instincts.

I never had anything to say because I had nothing, I felt nothing. Try learning about many subjects, develop a sense of curiosity, make that your truth.


Now this is my advice, but I truly do not know if it will help, but I'll be glad to help you anytime if you need it."

This reminds me of my cats and just made me tear up.


I have felt suicidal or extremely hopeless in the past, and one of my cats (bless her) could tell whenever I felt low, or anyone, if anyone was crying, she would instantly go to that person and I don't know why but she would calm me and drag me down to earth.

Cats got something I simply can't fathom.

However, it's likely because we subconsciously associate cats with babies, which gets me excited because if cats, a subconscious symbol in our mind that we can't bare but love leave that much of an effect on us, how would it be if we had a child, or at least for me.

But yeah, I treasure cats and am absolutely grateful for their existence.

ISFPs are the best at it imo, then ISTPs.
ESFJs and ENTPs are often exciting but it is best if the ENTP keeps it short so they could keep a track of what they're saying.

mbti,erjb3ij,t3_c1z036,1560921872.0,"This comment might get a lot of down votes but this is my honest truth.

ENFP= big no no, I dislike their emotionally driven behavior, they tend to be moody, extremely goofy, impulsivity with inferior Si is a huge EW

ESFP= slightly better than ENFPs, but too crazy for me, emotionally driven and tends to be either grossly possessive or uncommitted, not a type I could commit with

INFP= h o l y probably one of the least present and least practical types, will likely be lazy, extremely withdrawn, too dreamy, too sensitive 

ISFP= still emotionally driven but a bit more realistic, are often type 9s so they tend to be extremely lazy

I'm obviously not a fan of FP types, 10/10 wouldn't date irresponsible impulsive emotionally driven people who feel comfortable ignoring facts or being led with values. At most, I think ISFPs are dine, but NFPs are just something. I wouldn't ignore a good person based on their type yes, but if a relationship won't last then you oughta consider it. We only learn more about a person as time goes and that's when the weaknesses show."

On the cottonmouth part, I also couldn't salivate at all later that morning

Hmm what else
Yeah idk if I wanna change it though, I'll check w the doc later, although so far this is hella satisfying lmao

I'm also generally extremely hype and feisty today I was literally chill and the British in my accent intensified (my accent is a weird mix of American and British alongside few other accents in smaller percentages). LIKE WHAT? I'm literally jumping and screaming 24 7 (not in a childlike sense, though I've been told I act childlike). More like excited 24 7 and never wanting to sit.

If you wanna comment on them then sure go ahead because they love that too. They'll feel acknowledged.

Try this method

The less you try to be involved the more your presence matters 


Be loud, assertive, hella out going, it'll be impossible to miss you

Be the leader

People love the alpha vibes so go for that

Just dress, be, and act the best.

Good luck!"
mbti,er5yrn2,t1_er5xi0w,1560536277.0,"Well if it's a shitty marriage then yes (because who isn't gonna react that way- or maybe the reaction isn't likely because you care about commitment and your kids and sadness is only an obstable-- That's what inferior Fi is), however, the inferior function tends to be ignored and not really supressed for the sake of the dominant function. We only supress our inferior function when unhealthy. 

How could you actively use a function while hard cote denying reality. Again, in the case of a Te dom, we are using Te, and when applying it externally, could only think with Te.

Fi only really comes out during stress and not if (as people often joke about) when you poke at it. And it isn't even because that's a reaction. It's because as soon as we try to use it, we get really stressed and confused.

Now if one tells me I'm irrational or stupid, I don't get defensive, my first reaction is Te, not Fi. I get confused as to why they brought it up and what was flawed within my analysis and ask them to explain. Which often makes them reactive which confuses me even more. 

Fi isn't about sensitivity, it's about knowing what you want and appreciate. 

If you actively supress Fi, then it is likely a more conscious or stronger function, aka auxiliary Fi. Or an ENFP who's tryna appear more Te by acting all tough. 

So no, the 4s function isn't a point of vulnerability, it's just a function we don't care about and suck at using."
