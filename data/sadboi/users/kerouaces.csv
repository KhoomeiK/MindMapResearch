relationships,fr4ljq1,t3_gmcxfd,1589891525.0,"Someone did something like this to me and we stayed together for another two months until he finally told me he never loved me and was using me the whole time. I wish I had broken up with him after he abandoned me in the middle of nowhere. 

It doesn’t matter what you said to him that he got mad at. Even if you did say you wanted to break up, it’s abusive to do what he did. He put you in so much danger and punished you for having an opinion/plan he didn’t like. People who behave like that might also escalate their behavior over the years and I really don’t want you to have to go through that. I’m really sorry he did that. You deserve a lot better."
Anxiety,fqbfh70,t1_fq9lkew,1589236004.0,When I’m in that situation where people in a group have to go around saying something I immediately panic.
Anxiety,fqbf9w5,t3_ghiqy2,1589235900.0,"I literally came here to make this post. There was a letter on the bulletin board in my apartment that was delivered to the wrong address and it looked like it was sent from someone I used to work for. So I texted her and she said she thinks it wasn’t her. And it’s so simple when I type it out but feeling the awkwardness and embarrassment from this is so excruciating to me and I don’t know why. 

I feel genuinely terrible after most social interactions so just stay home or only talk to the few people I truly trust. I cannot cope with making social mistakes, even if they are harmless and no one else cares. I literally start spiraling every single time."

stimuluscheck,fozr3ns,t1_fozqsgr,1588195397.0,So basically May 1st is the last possible day it could be sent? That does help for sure. I’m sure I’ll be getting it soon. Thanks!

aspergirls,fky6gu9,t3_fl9vnu,1584642542.0,"Congratulations! My biggest interview tip is to find lists of common interview questions and practice saying them out loud and also to reflect on past jobs or experiences and just know what you learned from each, one challenge from each, one lesson, and one accomplishment. They might not ask all those exact questions, but it’s helpful to start thinking about your past jobs/volunteer jobs/clubs/projects/etc so when they ask about them, you can be really prepared!

I also always look at the company I’m applying for. My sister got a job at a designer handbag store because she looked them up and they had some specific ideas about what their ideal customer base is and she talked about that in her interview and got the job on the spot. I look up company values, mission statements, etc. 

Good luck!"

I’m fine with people being rich and treating themselves but there’s a difference between someone being able to afford a nice car they saved for, and someone owning a whole fleet. I like them but it really has always struck me as off."

My grandpa hated crowds and he hated people spending money on him. He was a very grumpy and wonderful man. So my dad has made peace with the fact that he might not be able to go. We are worried about my grandma because she actually lives in the US as we do and is scheduled to come back next month and I worry about her traveling.

orangetheory,fk7bkkj,t1_fk7azqv,1583932834.0,Hmm okay good to know! There’s a pending transaction on my credit card so I assumed it went through since I was charged for it.
