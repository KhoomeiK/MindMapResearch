raisedbynarcissists,fpptxnn,t3_gep2bf,1588809088.0,wtf is a flying monkey. good post btw.
depression,fpptq4v,t1_fpphqkx,1588808968.0,agreed and it sucks. maybe my mind will change. but i’m definitely scared.
awakened,fpp9gip,t3_fl9p6f,1588798254.0,"this was how i’ve felt about it “god” as well. i don’t think i could’ve expressed myself as well as you. thank u for this, i enjoyed the post."

ChildrenofDeadParents,fpfe45x,t3_gd1tqx,1588568580.0,beautiful. i am not them but i am happy for you. you’re so strong.
family,fpafeed,t3_gc1ml1,1588447031.0,it’s not a lame excuse. parents are supposed to be your world so i can imagine if they are or were you just feel everything crumbling down. i am sorry you feel unmotivated and lost. it’s not an excuse it’s a major shift. take some time to clear your mind. take things one step at a time at an ease. i failed poorly in school when they separated and didn’t reach out for the same reason. even tho i wish i recurved the help. feel better. i am here for you.
newtothenavy,fomq521,t3_g88e8r,1587899791.0,"i don’t understand why this post is getting more heat than recognition, someone legit took their time to explain what bootcamp is like in and i repeat in 2020. if you were in bootcamp years before this you shouldn’t have to comment about the “vibe” this gives off. times have changed and as many of you older people know, things have gotten some what simpler than what it used to be. therefore the comments people are making about this being incorrect are unnecessary as most of this has no relevance to your future experience if you’ve already graduated from bootcamp. how about realizing someone really took time out of their day to break down step by step what THEY saw and dealt with in bootcamp this year. people literally fucking blow my mind. thanks for the post!"
depression,fomhn2t,t1_fomgw92,1587890365.0,:( thank you.
depression,fomg25f,t1_fomfz4s,1587888707.0,who’s with me?
overcoming,fom86qr,t3_g895kg,1587881180.0,i think if help worked before you should reach out again. i can see you’re genuinely concerned over falling into that depressing stage in your life. please try to see if you can get the help. the worst that can happen is you end up breaking it off and feeling detached again. but it’s worth the try when you’re this scared. i hope you understand that you’re worth it and you matter. i’m here if you need to talk.
depression,foirkhn,t1_foiqzlj,1587794737.0,i feel your energy. thank you for being with me in this challenging time. i hope you heal.

overcoming,fg4z4f9,t3_ewwemw,1580514384.0,"hey sorry about that, growing up at home was hard so id use food as a way to cope with the sadness and stress at like the age of 10. i can imagine you probrably feel guilty sometimes about it because i do too. growing up with those bad habits theyve sort of stuck with me. eating in quiet to not get caught or eating myself up until i was too full. i as well have controlled those bad eating habits. thanks for sharing your story, i can relate very well and i hope you keep up the great work!"

newtothenavy,f84aqqm,t3_dyw9nj,1574238465.0,nah. just observe. no touch.
family,f84aoyk,t3_dyyjyg,1574238391.0,"oh no, you need to tell your husband how you feel. he’s not being a man if he isn’t noticing this problem. you’re beyond strong words can’t even describe the kind of woman you are. independent, intelligent and determined. i am sorry but these people need to be removed from your path. they’re blocking you from better opportunities and blessings. i am sorry about your husband and his job and i’m so so so sorry about his ignorant money hungry family. i hope you and your baby pull through 100%. i get hes your husband but he needs to step up. you’re born alone you die alone. focus on yourself and that baby. he either mans up and gets his act together or you’re both going to slip. the harder the fall, the longer it takes to get back up. you’re in my prayers."

mentalhealth,f79jt0r,t3_dur7yd,1573508625.0,"you basically described me. i really understood this, i say the same thing all the time and only few understand. being funny and making people laugh and smile makes me feel like i’m atleast good at something. thanks for writing this, i needed to read it."
LostALovedOne,f77fmbs,t3_dulgpp,1573454496.0,"with time it will. i’m sorry for your loss, i’m not going to lie and say you’ll fully heal because these types of things don’t always fully heal. it’s like a wound that you hit sometimes and hurts here and there you know. never fully closes. some days will be easier than others. you’ll feel happy and blessed to know they’re watching over you and other days you may feel so alone and lost. with bad days come good ones and i promise you’ll learn to somehow control your emotions towards this. if you ever need to chat i’m here. just reach out please. you are loved. keep making him proud from down here while he protects you from up there <3"
mentalhealth,f71boes,t1_f6zcunm,1573338749.0,EXACTLY! they get paid to listen until you find someone who you genuinely trust. but don’t give up guys!! always someone around willing to listen. you can always message me. stay strong loves <3

mentalhealth,f5vxuzp,t3_dpjog0,1572505478.0,"i completely understand your frustration with therapy, i hated it. i hated sitting in a room for 40 fucking minutes knowing they couldn’t give a rats ass about what was really wrong with me. i hope you find another way to cope. maybe the gym?? medication didn’t help me. on top of taking mine i always got high. it took for me to hit my lowest point to realize what was really happening and i snapped back to reality. i hope you heal. you seem like an amazing soul <3"
