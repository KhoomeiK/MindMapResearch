Depends on how OP’s mom was. It isn’t abnormal for parents to talk to other parents - especially their SO’s - about their kids’ development. OP’s now-step dad had a daughter around the same age. I can see how texting that Mom knew because she saw pubic hair when getting out of the shower is inappropriate, and had it been me I would have just said that I could tell my daughter was getting close to her first period and expressed my feelings, maybe asked for advice from e Step dad - who has a daughter around OP’s age - how to prepare for your kid going into their teenage years. To vent about feelings or whatever was needed. 

Now, Mom constantly bringing up this story tp random people is really weird and kind of gross. Understandably an invasion of privacy. And OP’s feelings as a kid of betrayal and wanting to hide it from Mom is understandable and valid. Story doesn’t sound funny it sounds inappropriate to tell in most if not all situations. 

I think OP’s update about having a one on one with Mom is the best course of action. You would be the AH for going off without talking to her first but I give a NTA for your feelings and the situation as a whole."

She didn’t even get some of her things out because they were so picky about who could come with her to retrieve her things (they refused anyone at all until she mentioned her ex-boyfriend they love and they allowed him). It was a horrible situation and she hasn’t spoken to her since. Couples therapy brought out a lot of repressed abuse she went through growing up and she has come to realize much of what she thought was “normal” was actually abuse. We are now engaged and she still hasn’t spoken to them (although not for lack of trying on EP’s part, as they go into her work about once a month and corner her into talking with them since she works at a customer service desk and can’t leave). We are starting to plan our wedding and it makes me extremely nervous that something like this will happen when we get married... or that they’ll try to crash it, as we live in a small town.

AmItheAsshole,fqevefo,t3_gie7jj,1589314233.0,"It’s extremely sexist for her to say it is degrading for you to let your boyfriend tie you up, even if that’s not how your dynamic is. Not only is it absolutely none of her business, but also it is empowering for many women to sub - myself included! (Though I’m currently dating a woman, I always sub.) BDSM is all about consent and there is nothing wrong with a woman being submissive in a relationship in any context so long as she *chooses to be*!!! Oppression of woman having to be subservient to men is all about being *forced* to. If a woman wants to be a stay at home mom or wife and wants to play a more “traditional” role, that’s awesome! More power to you! If not, great! Feminism is about equality and women getting to choose how they live their lives and not being forced by law, social conventions, or their partner to do something they don’t want to or being without choice in the matter. So many fake feminists think it’s wrong to be or do the examples I’ve listed and it makes me sick.

You can say that your kid was being an asshole even, but there is a difference between “Bullying is not okay and here’s why and it’s not okay to do this and you were the jerk/asshole in this situation because blank.” And “You’re a piece of shit for bullying that kid, you’re a horrible person, you’re a disgrace, etc.” Don’t know if that’s how you meant it but that’s just how it comes across.

So long as you approach the situation calmly and express that you feel that the two of them are closer than you are with them, and that you feel left out and unequal in the situation, I don’t see why you shouldn’t just outright tell her. It may hurt her feelings a little and that is a reasonable possibility, but your feelings are hurt too and it’s important to acknowledge them. Just make sure you phrase it non-accusingly.

Every once and a while she’d come out to me in a onsie making dinner with my Daddy and she didn’t care. 

However, sometimes you can’t be that open. My brother currently lives with us and there are things I can’t so around him. Coloring and drawing are no big deals, footsie pajamas he just writes off as being comfortable and he knows I have a ton of stuffies still and doesn’t really care. He actually brought me back pokemon ones from Build a Bear as a gift because he knows I love them and I cosplay with them. He did ask once about why I had sippy cups and I just said I like to use them in bed so I don’t spill all over myself. 

So I guess it depends on the roommate. All else fails, you could just keep to yourself like the other comment says but that doesn’t always work with eating/making dinner and laundry, etc. Kids plates can be explained as portion control or plates from your childhood you didn’t want to throw out and you still use because, well, a plate is a plate."

Distractions aren’t bad either, although that may only be a temporary fix for s long-term problem. It does help to get him back to a manageable place, though. 

Ultimately, he will need to seek professional help if he isn’t already. He also has to want to get better for himself, because otherwise it can put too much on you and if/when you guys fight or have issues, he may not want to be better or try anymore (speaking from personal experience, a “I’ll get better for you” mindset can become very toxic very fast).

AmItheAsshole,fad8364,t3_e8kend,1575958929.0,"Maybe this is just me but... isn’t kissing on the lips kind of inherently romantic? Maybe I just grew up in a home that didn’t do that and my parents weren’t overly affectionate in terms of kissing. When I (F21) was very little (like 2-4) and my brother was a newborn I used to kiss him on the lips to show affection (obviously NOT romantically) but that was before I was old enough to understand different kinds of affection are okay in certain situations and not others. My girlfriend’s parents kisser her on the lips until she was 18 and this made her super uncomfortable and it shocked me when I found out because I thought that to be really inappropriate (particularly because she wasn’t comfortable with it but felt forced to continue as she grew older). Showing affection platonically is totally fine and okay. Things like holding hands, hugging, kissing on cheek/face and even cuddling are things I can see being platonic but kissing on the lips feels too intimate for me to do with friends. If that’s not the case with OP and his friends that’s fine but I think it’s fair for her GF to maybe be uncomfortable with that level of affection outside their relationship. 

So, NAH. OP was fine doing this with friends but I think if it makes his gf uncomfortable it’s healthy and okay for them to have an open conversation about what makes her comfortable or not. It isn’t like this is a kiss on the cheek or something."

DDlgAdvice,facm43t,t1_fabwlnb,1575942217.0,This is the other thing we’ve struggles with.... it makes you feel like she doesn’t want to be your Mommy and just does it to make you happy right? That’s how J felt with my Daddy and when we talked about this they assures me that isn’t the case and it really helped steer the conversation into a productive place. Tell her you need her to make you feel really little after you’ve been Mommy for her.
DDlgAdvice,faclwrj,t3_e8h0gm,1575942106.0,"This is something my girlfriend and I (who I call Daddy) have struggled with a lot, too. She’s a switch, and a middle, but I’m very much exclusively a sub/little. I’ve tried for her a few times, and in other relationships, to be dominant or be the one in charge and I really have a hard time with it. If my Daddy is too stressed she does the same as I do, regresses and gets little. I’ve had a hard time adjusting to trying to be big and strong for her and as much as I want to help her, it’s excruciating for me to be Big and take care of her sometimes, especially if it’s for multiple days on end without me getting to be little. It does really make me have a hard time getting into little space too, so I like totally get exactly how you feel here. 

I’ve just tried being open with her, letting her know that little space is my safe space too and that it can be overwhelming sometimes to help her if I’m feeling little too. I’ve tried to find ways that can help her when she’s struggling while she stays big, ways that as a little I can help my Daddy through their struggles you know? Maybe you could have her try staying big when she’s stressed and you can help by letting her get out her bad feelings and stress in a healthier way by focusing on you. You can make her feel big and strong and capable! It helps for my Daddy when I say things like (I’ll switch names so you could use these!) “Mommy, you’re so strong!!! It’ll be okay Mommy, your little girl will cuddles you til you feel all better!!!” Or “Does Mommy has the bad feelings again? What can babygirl do to help you Mommy? Can I rub your feet or get us a baths ready?” This way, sometimes she can be little but also stay big when you need that too - while still feeling taken care of."

DDlgAdvice,f9ljftx,t3_e5o34a,1575424592.0,"I’m only 21 and no kids, but here’s my take...

Each partner takes on different roles in a relationship. Maybe explain to your kids that he isn’t bossing gun you around, but you each control different parts of the relationship. For example, maybe your Daddy takes care of the finances and you take care of organizing things around the house. Explain how each job is necessary and that the two of you have decided who is best at what. It isn’t oppression if it is what you have chosen, make is clear that you truly prefer him to handle those things in order for it to not stress you and that you control other things (like interior design of your home, or decisions about the cars or whatever it may be). Let them know it’s all equal but divided to be most efficient for your relationship. 

Also, if you two want to have kids of your own one day it is very common to call him Daddy because that’s what your future kids will call him!"
AmItheAsshole,f9k9bub,t3_e5dc9j,1575395631.0,"ESH I’ve had a lot of friends who “banter” with me, but actually mean the hurtful things they’re saying, and it’s awful. Amy shouldn’t be commenting on her weight like that, regardless. If she was concerned about how little your girlfriend was eating and her weight, that should be a one-on-one conversation between the two girls where Any would ask if she’s eating enough, if her doctor thinks she’s a healthy weight, things that are ensuring that your girlfriend isn’t denying herself the food and nutrients she needs in order to keep herself thin (I was anorexic for quite a while so friends expressing this concern can be hard but in this way wouldn’t be bashing her weight and would be healthy, genuine concern for your gf’s health).

On the flip side, you retorting back by commenting on Amy being larger is completely unacceptable. The whole “eye for an eye” thing isn’t cool. You could have calmly been like “that’s not okay for you to say to my girlfriend and this night won’t continue if you proceed to insult my girlfriend’s weight and eating habits” or something more in your own words. Causing a scene in the restaurant over the comment was probably a bit much and the only reason Amy probably said it was because she’s insecure and jealous of your gf’s small proportions (which in no way makes what she said okay, but trying to see both sides here). You could have put your foot down about what she said without attacking her weight as well, that would have been a better way to handle it."

DDlgAdvice,f9d8a6q,t3_e4j8vr,1575231125.0,"Here are some rules I’ve had in long-distance relationships like this that might help!! 

❤️ If you like your Daddy having say in what you wear, have a rule that makes you have to approve what you are wearing for the day by sending cute pictures of you in the outfit to him every morning!! 

🧡 No self-play-time without Daddy’s permission. Some people don’t like this, but I’ve always liked this rule because it made me feel closer and more intimate to my Daddy when he was far away. Or, alternatively, no self-play-time unless you send sexy pictures to him while you do. Makes him miss you too 😘

💛 Scheduled wake up & bed times. If you need an exception, obviously you can ask him to change it based on that day’s tasks, but having this routine is nice. 

💚 Hourly (or interval) check-ins. This might not be possible depending on what you and your Daddy work, but if you have an opportunity every hour, let him know what you’ve been up to and how much you miss him! If hourly is too much, then figure out a time interval that works for both of you. Even if he can’t respond every hour, he’ll be excited to see your updates and you’ll look forward to hearing back from him. 

💙 Scheduled skype/video calls. Whether it be nightly or weekly, having a set time which you both have to log on and spend at least an hour together. You can talk about anything! (Or get naughty if you want😉) These can also be a way of administering punishments if need be by making you spank yourself as he watches or his teasing you but not letting you release - or whatever you two decide! This keeps punishments from going too long and being ineffective. 

💜 Telling him when you eat and do chores/take care of yourself. This makes sure you are keeping up with all the taking care of you that he usually does. 

Hope these helped!!!"

AmItheAsshole,f95wbur,t1_f948spz,1575136332.0,"I was a honeymoon baby born while my mom was on the pill and they used a condom.... shit happens, contraception isn’t 100% effective. A paternity test isn’t a bad idea if you suspect it may not be your child but it isn’t impossible. Also, maybe y’all didn’t want kids but she is pregnant now... maybe she doesn’t want to get an abortion or throw this kid into a horrible foster care system. If you don’t want to be a dad that’s fine, and owning up to that now and not getting your kid’s hopes up and being a flakey father is probably for the best. But she isn’t being an AH for changing her mind and wanting to keep the baby. Turning big your friends on you... not cool, but I would want more info about that to determine if she’s being horrible or not."

It has been long enough that the kids won’t think you’re not fully enforcing the punishment, and behavior has improved. Just make sure you are prepared to take them away again after a warning or two if that behavior starts up again... make sure they understand they are getting them back due to improved behavior and that if they revert back to the bad behavior the same thing will happen."
