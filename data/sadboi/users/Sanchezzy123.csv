I could control when, where, and with who. But that slowly changed. Eventually I was using all the time, everywhere, with anyone who would ask. And this obviously had a very negative impact on every part of my life. A few times, I managed to put stuff away for a week, maybe two, but then months would pass of constant using. 

Anyways this continued for a long time. My friends were all in the same boat, but none of them saw any problems with that. No matter what I tried, I kept using, and my using got worse. It wasnt until I had a psychotic slip that I realized... maybe I cant do.this alone, and the following week checked into a inhouse rehab program.. this probably saved my life.

My point, is that rehab is an option. It isnt mandatory to get clean, but it sure as hell helps, and it's best to do before it gets too bad.if you find you cant stay clean by yourself, then rehab is definitely a viable option

My brain felt rusty, I was constantly seeing little movements and noises, I could not form a sentence (out loud or in my own head), and even walking to the bathroom was a joke. 

I'm an experienced drug user (with cocaine and crack). So I knew the small amount I did should not induce such strong problems especially 24 hours after dosing. I ended up realizing it was over stimulation, things would calm down if I just sat still and sort of just... mellowed out in the dark. The shitty thing is that it lasted up to 72 hours after my final dose.

LUCKILY. This also kicked my ass and made me realize how badly one can trip out from these things. So for me, it was my moment of realization for my sobriety (going on about a week now).

Dont over think, this will pass, just make sure you give your body time and the proper nutrition if you intend to keep using."

BreakUps,f22u6rx,t3_dbmh9f,1569897140.0,"I'm going on two years since the official break up. Might actually be 3 now I'm not sure. But I still have moments of sadness and regret. However I also know that most of it now is more so just me missing being in a relationship. I miss having someone to sleep beside, talk too, vent too, so on and so on. It can take a long time, but remember to focus on your own life. And life will continue."

Being with the singer during the day, but at night she dreams about somebody else. And he is either oblivious to the fact, or he knows and just let's it happen, pretending its about him."
