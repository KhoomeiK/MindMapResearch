MMJ,fqz7vek,t1_fqyx0cx,1589761717.0,"Step 2: Making the base:

After 1 hr in the freezer, the bud will be ready to be ground up into the smallest powder possible.  The best way to do this is to use a blade coffee grinder.  You could use a mortar and pestle, but it would take a lot of time.

Grind up the decarbed bud for as long as it takes to turn the bud flour into a powderized state.   Add this powder to a small saucepan with about 1-2 teaspoons per 7 gms.

All you need to do is to stir thoroughly, let cool and you should have a consistency of wet clay or paste.  This can be kept in the fridge indefinitely, to be used to make any edible recipe, or turned into capsules or used in chocolate.

There are many ways to dose it out, but here's one example:

You just bought 7 g of 25% THC bud.   That would convert to about 1,500 mg of THC:   7 g x .25 x .85 = 1.4875.  (The .85 is an estimate of actual THCA converted, you don't have to use it, but it gives you a more realistic result)

It's easy to find a $50 1/4 in some places around the country, so in this case you'd be looking at about 3.3 cents per milligram."
MMJ,fqybfhb,t1_fqxiugo,1589745871.0,"There are a million different recipes out there, but I've found one process that I've used for several years now.   The two main advantages of this method are that it uses 100% of the flower (except stems), and it's extremely simple.   It involves only two steps to create a base medicine.

Of number one importance is efficient decarboxylation, the conversion of THCA into THC, which can be achieved by heating the bud to 240°F for about 40-45 minutes.  I highly suggest getting a digital remote thermometer for this because I've found stove temperature settings to vary by tens of degrees depending on if you're using upper or lower grates.

But first you should de-stem the flower, also break the bud into small 1/4 inch or smaller pieces.  Put the bud into an aluminum foil pouch and seal the edges.  The thermometer should be placed under or on the pouch ideally on an insulated baking sheet or pan.

Most likely you'll have to turn the oven temp higher than 240°, because aluminum reflects infrared heat.   Once the probe thermometer reaches 240 F start timing 40 minutes.

After the time is up, let cool down in the oven.   When it is correctly done, the flower will have turned from greenish to a light toasty brown-gold color.  The aroma will have changed to more earthy and menthol, very medicinal and strong.
