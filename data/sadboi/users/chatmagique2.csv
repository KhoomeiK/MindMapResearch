First, you both have advanced degrees and clearly have the drive and determination to make positive changes - you‚Äôve picked up everything and moved at least twice, you‚Äôre making good use of your downtime by getting additional training online, and you‚Äôre already thinking ahead and figuring out which obstacles will be in front of you and how you might address them. Secondly, you mention fearing it will be hard after being ‚Äúunemployed for four months‚Äù, but please know that there are literally millions in that situation and future employers will certainly understand any gaps in your employment history given this unprecedented time. I know it‚Äôs nerve wracking now and you are literally stuck in limbo, but I have absolute faith that you will both land on your feet and thrive after things settle down. Hang in there.

I also hid my browsers inside folders so I‚Äôd be less tempted to click on them. Doing this didn‚Äôt change reality but it helped me to use other methods to gradually get a grip.

Trust me. I was in such bad shape that I was almost willing myself to have a dissociative experience or a break from sanity in the hopes it would bring me relief. I am not there now. It does get better."

I appreciate it more than words can describe. A complicating factor for me is that I have MS and am on a very strong medication that suppresses my immune system, and we got word on Friday that there was a case at our teen daughter‚Äôs school, so I‚Äôve had to self-quarantine inside my own house for protection, and yesterday was my daughters birthday. And I started to spiral out of control mentally. 

Starting now, after talking with a doctor, I am increasing my antidepressant dose and trying to do radical self-care. I‚Äôve deleted all news apps from my phone, too. And I am trying to keep eating, even if I can only tolerate small bites. 

I‚Äôve also realized that my role in my of my relationships has been to take care of other people‚Äôs emotions (primarily with several friends), so that‚Äôs something I need to reconfigure so that I don‚Äôt keep doing that at my own expense. I will need to go back to therapy to work on that for sure.

Have you contacted a Canadian embassy or whatever the agency in Canada is that helps bring its people home if they have difficulties with travel? If not, try that if you can , just to make them aware of your plans. That way, if anything weird or disruptive happens, you will already have made contact and can follow up for assistance. I can‚Äôt promise this will work, but it certainly could help. 

Also, if you can, write down all the FACTS that you know, rather than the fears. You are headed home. You have flights booked and you have a connection in Seoul. Your country of residence wants to allow its people to come home. You are scared right now and that‚Äôs normal. But you are safe right now. Generally people are good and want to help each other. The Koreans are wonderful people and will help you on the off chance you get delayed for a short time in Seoul. You will eventually make it home. Etc. Write down any other facts you know. Any people who could help you for instance, either with money, coordination, or mental support. Even strangers can help!

Do you have access to any food right now? Any kind of snack or something that would be comfort food and that you could stomach? Maybe you don‚Äôt feel like you can eat, but try to get a few bites into you. If you still can‚Äôt eat, at least drink something to stay hydrated. Something with calories if you can. 

If you can‚Äôt sleep, cover yourself with blankets or clothes or anything heavy. It provides comfort like a hug. 

You will get through this and you will get home. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling so scared. So many people are. You are not alone even though you must feel so alone right now. Keep me posted please. I will send major energy into the world to help escort you home safely and quickly!!!"

I wasn‚Äôt, but it was my first panic attack and I was confused and terrified because I had no experience with that. 

One thing I‚Äôve found that helps when I fear one is about to come in - I start singing out loud!  It helps control my breathing and ensures I don‚Äôt hyperventilate. I‚Äôve stopped several panic attacks right at the start with this method. And I haven‚Äôt had many since-the first one was the worst because I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening.

I‚Äôm wondering though, with this virus, it‚Äôs the elders who are mainly dying - does that call this theory into question then?

We still have so much to learn about the new virus and how it affects people of all ages and health statuses, of course. I‚Äôm scared to death, being Ocrevus for 2.5 years now and due for my next infusion in April (which I might delay). 

Still, I am honestly hoping you are right - that partial immune suppression could help us rather than hurt us!"
LifeProTips,fjwx9iy,t3_ff7rto,1583648404.0,This is a very bad idea. You‚Äôre contaminating the vegetables in order to protect yourself.
LifeProTips,fjnilis,t3_fedzua,1583508184.0,Great idea. Thank you.
mentalhealth,fjg2n8p,t3_fd8v3r,1583308764.0,"Well, gosh, you‚Äôve dealt with some really hard stuff! I‚Äôm so sorry for your losses and shocks and trauma. It‚Äôs certainly understandable that you are afraid of trusting that things will go well for now. 

But I hear you that you don‚Äôt want these fears to limit your life and negatively affect your quality of life. You sound wise and ready to find ways to heal from past traumas to make your future brighter and even just EASIER. 

Have you tried or would you have access to therapy? A skilled therapist whom you trust and have a good rapport with could be a godsend. But I know it‚Äôs not always easy to find one or be able to access and afford one. 

What have you tried so far?"
MultipleSclerosis,fj1j5it,t1_fj11r1y,1582921170.0,"Right. Some do, although I‚Äôve heard that that‚Äôs changing as they realize how effective the strong meds are."
MultipleSclerosis,fj1j163,t1_fj18efs,1582921098.0,Both!  It‚Äôs really good.
MultipleSclerosis,fj0wow7,t1_fj0rmlc,1582908985.0,One thing to know - both Ocrevus and Tysabri have copay assistance programs and you end up paying very little out of pocket for those two infusion meds if you go with them.  And it‚Äôs not hard to qualify for copay assistance - I have a very good salary and still qualified for both of them.
MultipleSclerosis,fj0wg55,t1_fizx2av,1582908874.0,Ocrevus since 2017. I first started with Tysabri then switched when Ocrevus became available. I go to the University of Colorado MS Center where they believe in treating MS with the strongest meds possible at first and it has truly worked for me. I have had no relapses and very very little progression of disease.
