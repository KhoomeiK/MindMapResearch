I was gonna start karate but I wrecked my MCL ligament last year and now I can’t channel my rage the way I want. I’m still biking and I’m trying to find ways to get the rage out by visualization while biking but I need something that helps me to reclaim my power.

Also I’ve had a hard time living this belief that I’m cursed of just a piece of white trash. Working in professional kitchens hasn’t helped so in some ways having this break has been doing me some good. Mental illness is fucking complicated and just getting a hugs is sometimes all a person need. It’s been years it feels like since I’ve had a truly loving hug or cuddle session.

dating,fpdglfy,t1_fpdfogv,1588526585.0,"Mental illness is huge. I suffer from severe C-PTSD so I understand the feeling however really the only thing that helps people are people. We are social creatures and when we separate ourselves from those that are vulnerable to a weak mind it makes the problem worse. I’m an only child so sometimes I think I just can’t cope with a lot of human interaction at once. The quarantine has also shown me how much I need to fight my natural tendencies to run away and hide from people. Mental illness is definitely very hard to cope with for all parties involved. I’ve recently had a lot of connections due because of bad behavior of my part due to unmanaged mental illness. The health system does not help. However when you have a mental illness you’re fighting with yourself everyday of your life and it gets very exhausting. Honestly that’s the biggest reason I wish I had a partner, but I don’t want to drain them of their life force which can happen. It’s complicated but I feel like I have purpose when I’m in a committed relationship to someone who genuinely cares about me. My ex husband was a huge learning experience for me"

I’m seeing all of the connections I’ve built over the years melt away from me and I don’t have control over my compulsive behavior and then I obsess and then everything spirals out of control. This last week with being used by a engaged man and having him get caught and throw me away was a huge wake up call. I hate the fact I miss him. I hate the fact I yearn for this back stabbing prick. I hate the fact his fiancée took him back. More than anything in life I wanted my dad and I wanted him to be someone who cared about his family in an effective way. Instead of pretending he’s a Lakota shaman. My favorite movie has been ruined by the engaged man I helped cheat with.  I want my friends and family back but I don’t think I’m gonna get them.

His partner took him back so they can try to work on their problems and I got thrown away like trash. I was controlled by extreme loneliness and drug abuse. I played the victim fiddle perfectly and let myself be a home wrecker. I hope you find some kind of solace in knowing that I regret my actions and I have learned how weak I truly am. I have enough shame now and I’m not sure how to let go and forgive myself.

Snapchat had become a recent problem. Obsession over a man and his engagement become huge. He was obsessed over me sexually and we sexted for a long time and I deluded myself into thinking he would leave her for me.

The thing I need is a community of people that have seen the painful life experiences I have so I don’t feel alone. I’ve had most of my friendships turn away from me in the last 4 years. I’m starting to see how the drug abuse has skewed my moral path.
