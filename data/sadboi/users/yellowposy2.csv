I know it can be hard to get an appointment with a psych.

•	⁠1 cup dry Cream of Wheat

•	⁠1.5 Tb oil (I like peanut)

•	⁠1/4 cup peanuts or cashews (raw unsalted is best)

•	⁠1/2 red onion

•	⁠Other veggies, chopped; whatever you have on hand is fine, I usually add up to 2 cups of veggies. This time I used bell pepper, jalapeño, and mushrooms

•	⁠fresh cilantro to taste

•	⁠big squeeze of lemon or lime

•	⁠Spices: I don’t have a great spice cabinet so I use what I have. Today I used about 1.5 Tb Vindaloo seasoning, about 1 Tb raw grated ginger, and salt. The recipe I was taught used whole mustard seeds, whole cumin seeds, and asafoetida.

Recipe

1.	⁠Toast the dry Cream of Wheat in a medium high pan til fragrant but not brown (about 5-6 minutes if you wait til the pan is hot to add the CoW). Pour into a bowl and set aside.

2.	⁠Heat up your oil in a medium hot pan, add peanuts or cashews and toast them til lightly browned. Add spices (just the dry ones); toast for two minutes.

3.	⁠Turn the heat down to medium and add onion. Cook til lightly translucent then add wet seasonings (garlic/ginger) if using; cook for about one minute.

4.	⁠Add your veggies! My personal faves are frozen peas, chunks of baked potatoes, jalapeño, and bell pepper. When the veggies are cooked through, taste, and add more salt or spices if necessary.

5.	⁠Increase heat to medium high, and add three cups of water to the pan. Heat to a boil. When the water is boiling, add cream of wheat to the pan about 1/4 cup at a time, and stir it in before adding more.

6.	⁠When all the Cream of Wheat has been added, turn the heat down to low and cover the pan. Let it sit for two minutes.

7.	⁠Mix in fresh cilantro and squeeze of lemon. Taste and season again if necessary.  Enjoy!

I noticed the other commenter is talking about HAES and that stuff never really made sense to me/often triggered me in the wrong direction so I thought I’d comment with some stuff that helps me when I feel the same thing.


Unfortunately, people with EDs often have body dysmorphia. I know you feel uncomfortable at your weight, but when you were struggling with AN, did you ever feel comfortable with your weight? I’m guessing no. The thing that makes unnecessary weight loss (by unnecessary I mean medically unnecessary) tricky in ED recovery is that there is no point that the ED brain will be satisfied with your new body image. 


Right now you might be thinking, well I know I’ll look better and feel better if I lose x pounds. But you won’t. It’s a negative thought loop where you can’t win.


However! Something that helps my feelings of body insecurity is feeling connected to my body. My negative body feelings are often related to a sense of disconnection/dissociation with my physical body. Doing things like yoga, biking, and dancing help me feel connected to my body and it’s movement, and that makes me feel grateful for my body’s strength and resilience.


Sending you love and support in recovery ❤️"
