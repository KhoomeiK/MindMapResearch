trichotillomania,fimsd45,t1_fimicf5,1582545123.0,I've always been and eyebrow and eyelash picker. It sounds odd but I swear it works like a charm...buy men's rogaine and put it on your brows! Can be generic brand. I heard of someone doing this and I was like meh why not. I had so much growth within 2 weeks it was crazy.

MakeNewFriendsHere,feer31j,t3_eoqovb,1579039407.0,"UM....are we personality dopplegangers ?! 

I'm 26 (F) and quite an extensive introvert myself. personally, I have a rather difficult time keeping and making friends due to my lifestyle and work. I've also come to notice that my friendships with males tend to have a stronger bond than with females. I don't enjoy gossiping or The Batchelor whereas a lot of basic chicks do....as you said= yourself...I don't feel like I am very similar to other Women. 

I also LOVE psychology and philosophy, throughout college, I had debated SO many times on whether to get my degree in Philosophy or Health Sciences. I ended up choosing Health Sciences just because I find it to be more applicable when finding a job. One of my favorite Philosophers is Heraclitus, I always loved his river fluxx. You cannot step into the same river twice, for you are not the same man, and that is not the same ever. For everything is constantly changing....it's something along those lines. Very good in my opinion. You should check it out if you haven't I think you'd enjoy it. 

I was a bit of a scene kid myself haha, wore safety pins in my ears and did all sorts of odd things lol. Punk Rock always has a place in my heart but I'm more of a rock /metal chick myself. I love Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Label Society, Pantera, Iced Earth, Def Leppard, Black Sabbath, White/Rob Zombie. Basically, if its a 70s and 80s hair band I more than likely love it. I also really love TV shows, books, and some video games. Breaking Bad is my absolute favorite show ever, who doesn't love a good underdog story!?

I'm not sure what else to include haha. I love cats, I have a pretty sadistic dark humor lol, ummmm...I suppose that's all she wrote haha. I'm so new to Reddit I don't even know how to send a DM....are DMs even a thing on here lol ?  Well If they are hit me up :) if you want of course!"
Anxiety,feek7x4,t3_eone9j,1579035427.0,"Honestly, I would express your anxiety to your dentist. Tons of people have voiced their concerns with fearing the dentist, myself included. I highly recommend doing anesthesia rather than just numbing. Being awake will only increase your anxiety, you'll be able to hear everything and feel the pressure of what's happening. I know you don't want to, but I really recommend it. You won't remember a thing and your out so quick you don't have much time to be anxious aside from the waiting room."
Anxiety,feeim0d,t3_eonw76,1579034496.0,"I don't feel like I'm being annoying....I feel more judged than anything. I find a lot of people aren't particularly into the same things I am. For instance, I enjoy The Handmaid's Tale and a common response I get is along the line of ""Ew that show is disgusting and extremely degrading to women, dark, and twisted. How can you enjoy women suffrage?"" Another example would be my line of work....its to graphic for many (Surgery) and so whenever I start talking about something very cool I've recently done....I get shut down QUICK! I feel your pain 100%. I feel like the black sheep more often than not."
