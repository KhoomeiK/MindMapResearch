AskReddit,fo8n98b,t1_fo8mo17,1587599909.0,"Yes I'm hoping too! Or at the very least take something new and positive from this. I think we all should, if not as a collective then definitely individually, big or small- even if it's something as simple as being that little bit  happier every time you step into a restaurant haha!"
AskReddit,fo8mc7o,t1_fo8lqje,1587599380.0,"Oh i have definitely gone from not being so comfortable on the phone to speaking for hours on it. I have spoken to some people on t he phone that would never have thought I would (due to feeling its not my place, they'd think its odd coming from me.) for long periods. im hoping it's changed our relationships in a positive way and it's not just in my head or one sided :P lool"

mentalhealth,ex44dg6,t3_cr8nmw,1565998137.0,"I have been feeling really gulity recently as i just turned 30 and feel like a failure in every capacity at life. As i a person with CP and in a wheelchair there are things i struggle with being capable of doing. Can't even a full time just 16 hours never had any type of romantic relationship either. Picture as just managing to peep through the open doors but them never really seeming to fully open no matter what i do and it makes me so sad cause i do try. 

All these feeling contributed to my GAD flaring up and then it creates a weird scenario where even being happy is a challenging even getting up can become hard almost something to proud off!?

Sometimes I feel like i should just except myself as a failure as my existence and just try to be happy in my lame existence to keep the depressive state at bay but its just a vicious cycle

Does this make any sense?"
