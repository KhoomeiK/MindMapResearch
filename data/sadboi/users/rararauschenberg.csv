bipolar,fm0w1py,t3_fs9dqv,1585667293.0,"Hey op! I started to get that “trapped” feeling the other day when all I could think about was the consequences of the virus. It’s not an easy thing to get your mind off of when it’s so REAL. The paranoia is gone more now, and replaced with almost a sense of duty? It’s weird, I know that things could go poorly....but they haven’t yet...so I’m just going to be a diligent citizen as best I can. I’m sorry you are feeling lonely right now too, if you do have someone you can call to get some worries off your chest I think they would be grateful you’re reaching out. If you don’t want to talk about the virus and get it off your mind, maybe talk to them about what you “would” like to do. Some goals might help! I fuckin showered today AND took my meds on time *the crowd cheers*. Even if it’s just to make myself feel better I give myself a pat on the back for that shit.

Don’t let the change hurt you, take it in stride, and try and notice your accomplishments these days! But please reach out! If you feel like a friend is too risky to talk to right now and you’re feeling insecure about telling them these things, post here or you can even shoot me a pm just to shoot the shit.

Take care of yourself OP don’t give up, there are all sorts of change, and good change comes too."

offmychest,flnqrgo,t3_fpyvub,1585324077.0,"Hey there, you sound exactly like me. I just got my head above water after struggling for a lot of years. I always just assumed I should “stop bothering people” or “keep that to yourself” or “theres no reason to speak because that would cause (a, (b, (c” or, and finally “it doesn’t matter if you can do it, anyone can do it, stop being full of yourself”
That last one always hit me the hardest, I downplay anything that is kindness toward me because I always thought people were JUST being polite and I’m not actually very deserving of those nice things or whenever I do something right, I immediately would downplay it in fear of appearing somehow better than i actually am, causing me to be a fraud.

Like what the fuck? I’m not allowed to enjoyyyy anything because I’m worried all the time, that’s balls.

I’m still in the process of doing this and it’s helping reframe a lot of my thinking. I went to group therapy and they would always say “what are your values, what are you? Are you someone that enjoys creativity, and your MODEST? Is kindness and understanding at the top of your list? Whats at the top of the list” 

When I sat down with it and was very honest with myself about what’s important to ME, it was almost like creating a daily title page, and the title page had my top five values. And on the following pages is my day on how I live according to what those words mean to me.

Okay so just grabbed my notebook and here are my top 5 just to give you an example:
1. Authenticity
2. Creativity

3. HUMILITY
4. Self awareness
5. Self-development

Notice how humility is in there! It’s funny trying to be genuine with yourself when you spent so long in limbo, I’m sorry you’re going through it OP. 
I hope you do well in the future, and remember that you’re an incredibly dynamic person and always changing, the fact that you have literally taken a mental note that change is happening in your life is pretty amazing, AND asking for help.

Edit: and be kind to yourself!"
LesbianActually,flnobfn,t3_fpym5h,1585322720.0,"I made something that has some of my favourite bright summer flavours last night, and if you don’t have a grill, a cast iron and even a steel pan would be fine for frying. Citrus marinaded chicken breasts (rosemary,thyme,garlic,ginger, zest and juice of orange, lemon and lime, olive oil, with salt and pepper), mango salad with red peppers and quick pickled red onions and a little cilantro (I just used parsley if you don’t like cilantro!) on the side is grilled pineapple. There is no carb in this one and I think some rice would go really good as well, or even on a tortilla with sour cream and the mango salad on top is pretty ballin. 

I didn’t get the marinade from a specific website (which is why I kinda just listed ingredients and not measurements), but the pickled red-onion is sooo good and super versatile, you can have it in sandwiches, salads, or most cooler temp quinoa or rice dishes that have veggies and meat (or no meat! I use baked tofu A LOT).

movies,fbatqlk,t1_fbaqrsb,1576686583.0,"I’m bipolar and I get psychosis during my mania and a lot of his delusions I relate to. I thought the mafia was in cahoots with the extraterrestrials and military and they were planning abductions of the mentally ill and that’s why no one believed me. And the reason why I was being hospitalized and put in solitary was for “pre-op” before I was altered forever. 

Written down they sound pretty funny, but I honestly would rather never have another psychosis episode as long as I live. You feel like there is always something wrong and that nightmares are happening while your eyes are open. 

I’m not saying anyone is wrong for thinking they’re a bit odd and funny but Hollywood makes it typically seem like the silliness is shared inside the psychotic person.

I think the public would be more fascinated knowing what being paranoid and psychotic actually feels like than how outsiders react to it.

Edit: also thank you for being a social worker, we need you guys. 

Edit 2: I mean this as another perspective, I don’t want to insinuate they are joking about mental illness!"
