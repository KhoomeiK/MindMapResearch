I think your wife needs to appreciate that if you wont tell her his secrets there's no hope in hell youd go blab to your mum.  
What concerns me is shes mad because she wants to dislike him and wants to maybe say, I told you so or whatever. You're keeping her from doing that in her eyes and I bet that's why shes really mad.
