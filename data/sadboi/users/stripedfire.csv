It happens when your brain is too stressed or anxious as a defense to try to get away from the environment. It knows your body may not be able to leave but it sure can.

It's really hard to fight through it but I've been working on warning my husband when I feel it coming on so we can try to stop before I actually cave. When I realize I've lost the battle with my emotions and I'm feeling out of control, I try really hard to tell him I can't continue right now and I need to walk away. If he fights it, I tell him he needs to respect it (if I have any strength left; often I just can't say anything else and end up giving him the silent treatment unintentionally).

The fact is, it always passes. When it does, you can look at what happened and start picking up the pieces. It might be great for you to write it down. I know my words are a lot better when they're written rather than voiced.

Also try to just take things one bite at a time. Chip away at some of the little things so you're getting stuff done then when it's time to face bigger stuff, it's not so intimidating.

I hate my bipolar most when it makes me irrational. That's when I feel actually cursed by it. This illness sucks but we can still fight back! Good luck.

I asked the woman who had been sitting at her desk the whole time if she'd moved them and she looked at the spot, astonished that they were gone and said no and no one had walked by that area either. I wondered if I'd gone blind or something so I literally felt the ground where I'd left my things and they were truly gone. The woman did the same, just because we felt like they had to be there. I looked away for a second then looked back and suddenly everything was exactly where I left it, not a thing had moved.

Again, none of their actions are your fault or responsibility but it may help you feel stronger if you do decide to report.

Also, your family may very well not look at you with pity and your life may not be completely changed. If it is, there's every likelihood it'll be in a great way because your abuser will be out of your life and you won't be stressing about the ""what if"" of that person harming someone else.

And finally, even though it's not your fault by any means if they did hurt your baby sister, you may still feel like it's your fault. Imagine yourself in the future, after finding out that your abuser also hurt your little sister, and think of how you'd feel. Would you be torn apart by the guilt (again not your fault but you may still feel it) because you didn't say something? Going through this scary experience now is very likely to prevent horrible pain for both you and your sister.

You're strong and can do this. Take a deep breath and remember your family will absolutely still love you and there is no shame in you admitting what happened to you.

Stay aware and remove yourself from situations once you recognize that you're not quite yourself.

I personally went with an HSA (Health Savings Account) plan because I'm young and only go to the doctor for annual check ups which are covered by the insurance I have for free. The low premium makes me feel like I'm saving money because I put the money I would have spent on the premium into my savings so it can accrue interest and I'm not just giving the insurance company a bunch of money. The negative is that it has a high deductible that must be met before they pay out for anything that isn't routine preventative care but for me it works great. This is with my very specific life situation based off the options I have available to me, but I hope that helps you categorize things and figure out how to break it down so it's not so overwhelming.

My need to get the hell out of the house before I suffocated and go somewhere to be emo seemed like my depression just being more intense. It wasn't until I was diagnosed that the pieces came together.

I came across as relatively normal although incredibly moody until that major breakdown which was triggered by a dramatic shift in my life situation and immense stress. I now know that serious stress makes my bipolar significantly worse but for the most part I do phenomenally well and many wouldn't guess there's anything different about me. I could see someone thinking there was a catalyst but the fact of the matter is I've been bipolar as far back as I remember.

I haven't heard of anyone developing bipolar due to trauma. The cases I've heard are all simply the brain being really stupid with hormone regulation. Some people I've known who were also really ignorant believed any mental illness was caused by trauma but truly some people are just born that way, especially in cases of bipolar.

I really get feeling defective. I get consumed with thoughts of ""why am I so fucked up?"" when my hypomanias are bad. The best way to look at it though, for me at least, is to see it the same as your height or feet size. You can't change that you have it and it can provide some really obnoxious challenges. You can obsess over the"" why?"" all you want but it's not changing just because you're pissed that you're in this situation. You need to focus your energy on figuring out solutions to deal with those challenges. It's not worth your time to fixate on a question when you can be looking for productive answers."

BipolarReddit,f06zhva,t3_d3zpld,1568449093.0,"From what I'm reading, it's seeming like your psychiatrist learned of your drastic reaction to the SSRIs and then diagnosed you with bipolar primarily based off of that. Is that the case?

I had two psychiatrists diagnose me and both of them gave me a questionnaire to fill out to assess my behaviors and patterns, even though they knew I had a rapid reaction to Zoloft and other medications.

If your psychiatrist did diagnose you based primarily off of a medication reaction, I'd honestly go get a second opinion. That sounds irresponsible to me. I'm not a therapist / psychiatrist / doctor / etc... so i might just not be in the know but I can say for certain that you can't conclusively diagnose someone with bipolar JUST because of a medication reaction and I haven't heard of a disorder that could be conclusively diagnosed that way. 

Maybe a second opinion would help you sort things out too? I can tell your looking for answers and I think it might be great either way to seek another resource to gain more insight.

Good luck on the diagnosis! It was relieving to me when I found out I had bipolar because everything suddenly made sense and we had a proper battle plan!"

BipolarReddit,ewxanmw,t3_cqj2ow,1565850669.0,"You should have lamotrigine in your hands. Generic means it has the same ingredients and works exactly the same too, so absolutely give it a go! It's typical to get the generic when it's available due to significantly lower costs.

Lamictal is an anti-epileptic med designed to level out the activity going on between neurons. Seizures are caused by imbalances of chemicals between neurons and bipolar is thought to be the same, just with different results. Feeling manic? You've probably got a high level of a neurotransmitter like dopamine or are significantly lacking one. Since seizure triggers (chemically speaking) are so similar to bipolar triggers, anti-epileptic meds are common methods of treatment and are typically very effective.

They're designed to level you out so if the Lamictal is working right, you'll have fewer ups and downs and when they do happen, chances are they won't be as intense.

It's been an incredible tool for leveling me out. We combine it with an antidepressant but I've been on Lamictal since I was diagnosed about 6 years ago. My bipolar hasn't gone away but I'm so much better than I was before treatment.

Remember meds work differently in everyone so it might not be a great fit for you. Give it a good try (including time to take effect) , stay very aware of your mood waves and emotions, and keep your psychiatrist informed (especially if you start going dark).

Congrats on the progress with your treatment! I hope it works really well for you.

Edited to ask what I actually meant to ask"
sociopath,ew3fjdn,t1_ew2h2pi,1565076359.0,"I'm also not the OP but figure I'd get involved in some conversation here. I've considered myself to have a much higher amount of empathy than a standard person (I feel bad for potentially hurting inanimate objects' feelings by leaving them out or disfiguringthem) but I don't know how I can compare to the other two I've seen in here. That being said...

I personally consider my empathy to be very accurate but you could potentially argue that's an egocentric view. Empathy starts with knowing someone is going through something you've gone through then feeling what you'd felt at that time and then bringing those feelings to the present so you're actually feeling them again. Once it evolves and you have more life experience, you can empathize with things you haven't gone through by using the closest basis you have and adjusting it using logic. I personally haven't lost a parent but I've lost loved pets, a grandmother-figure, and have felt pain from feeling left behind and lonely before. If I get too caught up in my head, I'll start to tear up but I catch it there and distract myself or cut it off so I don't cry over something that hasn't happened yet. Because there's no true way to know what someone else is feeling, empathy is an assumption. But in the same way, it's as much an assumption as what something tastes or smells like to someone else.

I've never found out what I was feeling while empathizing was wrong. I have learned that what I thought someone felt at a time was wrong but I wasn't caught up in the active emotions that the concept of empathy entails. Thinking further on it, I was feeling cognitive empathy at those times but something stopped me from going flown blown. Maybe I could tell something was off? This doesn't eliminate the possibility of it having happened though. It very well might have and I just never found out or noticed.

I feel shame or guilt when I know I've done something wrong that could get me in trouble. Instinct is to say that it has to do with someone else getting hurt or something but that's not the case. I've felt it when the only person it affects is me. I try to talk myself down and figure out how to prevent the feeling from happening again. For example, I was late to work a lot last month. Not by a lot but by enough to get in trouble if someone felt like making a big deal out of it. Most days I was fine but some days I'd have extreme anxiety that came from somewhere else which amplified my feelings and caused me to feel shame and guilt. I kept trying to cope by telling myself it's fine, I can't really get in much trouble and even if I did, it won't kill me or anything. I also kept thinking of ways to wiggle out of it and then fought those thoughts with ones of ""you need to take responsibility for your actions"". I effectively went through an obnoxious cycle until I forgot about it long enough for the anxiety to go away and the guilt with it.

If the person explained to me how their muted emotions feel, I believe I'd be able to empathize well. My husband experiences love and emotions differently from others and I recently learned my dad does too. I've been working through learning as much about the ways they experience life so I can identify and connect with them and know what's going on. Some concepts I still struggle with. Part of it is them struggling to describe it and part of it is my lack of comprehension. It's so different from my normal and it's something we're basically told won't come up so it's hard to wrap my head around but the more I learn the better I get. 

I knew I loved my husband when I could definitely say I'd forgive him for (almost) anything, would be willing to put my life in danger to save him (jump in front of a train or whatever), and that I believed the feeling to be unending. The instincts and strength have changed a lot over the 10 or so years we've been together but through our big challenges I've learned that it won't go away. Even if I wanted to stop loving him, even if I needed to, I simply can't. It's basically involuntary. I opened myself up to let it in originally but I'm not capable of getting rid of it now. But love also isn't quite an emotion - it's almost like another part of who I am. I'll do little things like scratch his head, vacuum, keep my shoes cleaned up, have the TV ready for him, etc. to make him happy because of that love. Those are actions caused by my love for him but at that point it's not emotion. Something else is driving those commands in my brain. The love just makes it possible. The love I feel for my pets is more passionate and even less voluntary. I did let that love in but it was a lot easier than with another person. I can forgive anything they do, no matter the damage it causes, because I know there's no malicious intent. I'll still get mad but I try harder to reign it in and don't really punish then because they're cats so they won't learn from anything I do. 

If something happened and I suddenly stopped feeling love for my husband it would complicate things but it's hard to know by how much. I wouldn't be so blinded by it and would more clearly see the negatives of our situation but at the same time, he's my best friend. We get each other much more deeply than anyone else. We laugh together, can predict what the other is thinking, know each other's patterns. Those things wouldn't go away even if the love did and those could keep us together, especially if my capacity for love disappeared entirely. I don't have human babies though raising my own little humans is one of the things I'm most looking forward to in my future. That's harder to speak to than if I lost love for my partner. Every image I have of my kids is entwined with love. I don't actually know how to extricate that love. Part of it would likely depend on their age. As a baby, I'd likely think they're cute but I'd feel a significantly smaller bond. If they've grown into free thinkers then there'd be more likelihood for respect and fascination with how their brains work (but I love figuring out brains so that's where that comes from). Since my cats are my kids right now I can say I'd be less patient and understanding but they're also still cute and I'd still keep in mind that their capacity for doing things with bad intentions or learning from whatever education I give would be limited so I'd treat them very well still. I just wouldn't dote on them like I do now. 

My reaction to remembering an emotional experience depends on how involved I am in the remembering. I often have barriers to stop me from getting the full force of an emotion since I'd be a big sissy all the time if I didn't. My standard emotional memory retrieval is surface level - in that event I'm remembering the events in a factual way. She steps away, I look up, I feel sadness and pain in my chest, now there are tears, I step forward, etc. I'm refusing to actually feel those emotions so I keep the memory very restricted. It would admittedly be like watching a movie in VR from the first person perspective. But sometimes I can't keep up that barrier. When that happens, it's a full fledged reliving of those feelings and it's more ""all at once"" than ""step by step"". Most of the time I'm feeling things this way because I'm experiencing empathy. The Lion King got me yesterday. My friend's pain almost got me today. On rare occasions I will experience this because I'm going through something else like feeling abandoned or worthless. The way life is now, it's because I'm in a bipolar hypomanic state. Before I was as self-assured as I am it happened a lot and was because of active feelings of loneliness and exclusion. When it's non empathetic, it's very very hard to control and brings up a lot of other times with it to, basically slapping me in the face with all the other times I've felt that way. 

Reliving feelings for me is honestly exactly like experiencing them in the present except it includes the knowledge of it being from the past and I have a different kind of block that I use for real-time emotions.

I can't say this is how everyone feels but I've tried to describe it as true to reality as I can. I do know many others describe empathy the same way so I'd consider myself to be a reliable source for that but again, that could just be me being egocentric."
BipolarReddit,ew2ttkd,t1_ew2n8go,1565055700.0,"My hypomanias are like that when they happen. They'll creep up slow at first then hit me full force around 1 or 2 am and keep me up for a few hours until I'm too mentally exhausted to stay awake. When I wake up, I feel beat up by it but in a normal way and everything else is back to normal. But it's almost always at night. Maybe being tired has something to do with it."
PsychMelee,evzxmci,t3_clyx7s,1564970007.0,"Antidepressants in those I know who have had depression took a minimum of a week and a half to a couple months before they kicked in.

When I was getting on them for the first time, I was expecting about 3 weeks before I'd see any improvement. Instead, I was incredibly happy the same day and entered a euphoric state. The rapid onset of the antidepressants is what told my psychiatrist he'd misdiagnosed me and I actually have bipolar.

Brains are different enough that nothing can truly be predicted. But in those who suffer from depression, it will more often take time to build up the ""happy chemicals"". The reason antidepressants frequently work so fast for those with bipolar is because we're not necessarily lacking those chemicals, there are just other chemicals messing with our brain functions that cause us to experience depression as well. Since we don't need the build up, they work really quickly."

OkCupid,evblfdr,t1_evarocl,1564382245.0,"I try to see that side of it too. It honestly does mean more since it's an actual choice rather than a potentially random firing of instincts and hormones. It's just so different from the concept of love most are used to and that makes it foreign and scary.

Part of it for me is not knowing how easily he could turn it off. For me, there's no turning this off, not without a lot of time, energy, and effort. But I currently have the impression that it's very possible he could wake up one day and say ""nah, I've changed my mind"" and leave it at that. Logically, I'm pretty sure that's just a dramatized fear, but there's so much I don't know about how his brain works and ways I have seen him turn off his emotions that I can't rule out the possibility and haven't been able to smother the fear."
relationship_advice,evaro6p,t1_evagtsh,1564355378.0,"I hate to automatically blame any particular mental illness without it being diagnosed first but I can confirm a lot of the behaviors reminded me of my bipolar as well. So to help OP, I want to point out what it officially looks like because it can be hard to recognize without it being pointed out.

Hypomanias or manias (manias are significantly more intense, last longer, and must cause harm to the person's life like losing a job or physically harming oneself) often cause random fixations like ""I must clean right now, even if it's 3 AM and I have to go do something at 6 AM - I can't rest until this is done"" or ""I need to paint and paint more and continue painting and never stop. I don't need sleep anyways"" or ""This living room's layout is so dumb now. I'm fixing it immediately. I want to go buy a couch! But it's so late the store is closed! I can't handle waiting for it to open!""

When I was unmedicated and also when my meds simply aren't enough to fight the chemicals screwing with my brain, I'll get irrational and blame my significant other. The worse the episode, the more ridiculous the blame. ""It's so clear you never loved me, you dont do anything for me! I make all the sacrifices and you don't care!"" even though he's been spending a lot of time and energy giving me love or taking me out to eat. I try really hard to control these and it usually results in me shutting down completely to prevent harm but sometimes that doesn't work.

These mood episodes can come literally out of no where, which is significantly more common with BP than when the episode has an explainable trigger. It's caused by chemicals being imbalanced in the brain, though they still haven't figured out what causes the chemicals to be unbalanced specifically. Thankfully, they do have meds that can make it much easier to live a normal life. Therapy is effective for some too, but you need a great therapist who can teach how to maintain presence of mind amidst the assault of chemicals so you can regain control of your thinking. 

OP, I applaud your patience, that's very difficult to be faced with. You can't diagnose her yourself and you'll need to get her to a psychiatrist. Manias and hypomanias can last a long time though it seems her pattern is faster than others.

When she comes back down, talk to her gently and express very clearly that you love her and want what's best for her, and would like her to see a psychiatrist.

Also, no matter what, and I really need to stress this given her behavior, DO NOT accept a depression diagnosis or allow her to only take antidepressants without a thorough evaluation to see if she has bipolar. They can really screw up a bipolar person's life because it triggers too much of one chemical. Depression is caused by a lack of chemicals and bipolar is caused by chemical levels being all around unbalanced so if they're given ""happy chemicals"" then it actually causes too much of those ""happy chemicals"" which can trigger a manic episode. That's how a lot of people actually learn they have bipolar rather than depression.

Sleep, as well, is fantastic and necessary for proper cognition and sleep deprivation is the cause of many scary (and stupid) ailments. Then diet absolutely affects chemical balances, cognition, and the effectiveness of your body's cells. 

Any of these can actually encourage new neurons and dendrites to grow which makes your brain run faster and smarter. Plus, it increases your lifespan and how long you hold on to a functioning brain throughout that lifespan.

If a sociopath expresses empathy, it's more likely to be cognitive empathy which is actually more of the knowledge of what empathy is rather than actual empathy itself. I can't rule out a sociopath's ability to feel empathy entirely given minds are so complex, everyone is different, and there are multiple ways psychologists diagnose it, but in all the cases I've seen, they don't actually feel empathy. 

My personal psychopath (for those who don't know, a little different from a sociopath but they both operate under the bucket of antisocial personality disorder and share the majority of traits) doesn't quite understand the concept of empathy itself and thinks it's actually sympathy. 

I'm glad you were able to get yourself out of an unhealthy relationship. That takes a lot of effort and healing but clearly you're doing a lot better which is super awesome!"
sociopath,eutgzde,t1_euqlxgj,1564025595.0,"I love how you posted about narcissists being trash when their focus is ""Me! Me! Me!"" then literally go on to say someone else doesn't matter and what does? Oh... ""Me""

Maybe you have some reflection going on there?"
Psychopathy,eup58n3,t3_ch3waq,1563951706.0,"They can definitely be depressed or extremely happy. A lot of things are person-dependent and many people try to over generalize which leads to wrong impressions.

So the answer is yes and the psychopath you're thinking of is likely the same but there could be more going on with their brain that would change the answer."
sociopath,euj9k4d,t1_eugecwo,1563865940.0,"What is it that motivates you to be so philanthropic? My husband is very motivated to be a philanthropist but it's literally because he's heard it's a good practice to increase personal happiness and he's also hoping to use it to train people to be less annoying.

I'm curious to know what drives others with ASPD (or similar brains) to be so... not antisocial."
