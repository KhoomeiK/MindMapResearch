I am not against my child meeting her birth parents when she is an adult but we adopted her from a very poor region. We are a middle-class family. I am afraid that if her parents turn out to be too poor, they or her siblings/half-siblings might emotionally blackmail her to extort money from her. I have heard too many horror stories like these. So, I would want my child to be cautious and alert when she treads down that path. Otherwise, I would love to see her and her birth parents reunited. I believe is love is limitless. I am not afraid that meeting her birth parents may affect her relationship with me. It might complete her which will obviously make me feel happy. I am proud of my munchkin and I want her to be showered with all the love and blessings. With another set of loving parents in her life, I will feel better I guess."

## Types of Paint

&#x200B;

### Oil Paint

Oil paints use white lead as a base, and are applied in three coats: primer, undercoat and finish coat. Oil paints can achieve mat and glossy finishes, while being durable and affordable. They are characterized by their ease of application, and painted surfaces are easy to clean. Oil paint is commonly used in walls, doors, windows and metal structures.

Note that oil paint is not suitable for humid conditions, and it takes time to dry completely. Also, before applying oil paints, linseed oil and pigments must be added.

### Enamel Paint

This type of paint is produced by adding lead or zinc to varnish. Pigments are added to achieve a wide variety of colors. Enamel paints form hard and glossy coatings, which are easily cleaned. They are characterized by being waterproof and chemically resistant, offering good coverage and color retention.

The following are some common uses of enamel paint:

* Interior and exterior walls
* Wood trims, doors, and flooring
* Windows
* Stairs
* Surfaces like wicker, masonry, concrete, plaster, glass, and metals.

The main limitations of enamel paint are slow drying, and requiring a titanium coating before application.

### Emulsion Paint

Emulsion paints use polyvinyl acetate and polystyrene as binding materials, and they contain driers like cobalt and manganese. They can be water or oil based, and pigments are used to achieve the desired color. Emulsion paints are characterized by their fast drying and hardening, and surfaces can be cleaned easily with water. Once applied, enamel paints offer durability, good color retention, and alkali resistance.

Emulsion paints are commonly used for interior walls, ceilings and masonry work. Some specialized types of emulsion paints can be used for woodwork.

### Cement Paint

Cement paint is available in powder form, which is mixed with water to achieve paint consistency. The base material is white or colored cement, and it may also contain pigments, accelerators and other additives. Cement paint is durable and waterproof, and it is commonly used in rough internal and external surfaces.

Consider that cement paint has a long drying time, typically 24 hours. It must also be applied in two coats to prevent dampness issues.

### Bituminous Paint

This type of paint is made from dissolved asphalt or tar, which gives it a characteristic black color. It is waterproof and alkali-resistant, but not suitable for applications where it will be exposed to the sun, since it deteriorates.

Bituminous paint is commonly used in underwater ironworks, concrete foundations, wooden surfaces and iron pipes. It also helps provide rust resistance when applied in metals.

### Aluminium Paint

This type of paint is produced by mixing aluminium particles with oil varnish. It is resistant to corrosion, electricity and weather exposure. Aluminum paint is commonly used for metals and wood, and some specific applications are gas tanks, oil tanks, water pipes and radiators.

### Anti-Corrosive Paint

Anticorrosive paint is characterized by its chemical resistance, as implied by its name. It is made from linseed oil, zinc chrome and fine sand. Anticorrosive paint has a black color, and it is durable and affordable. It is normally used for metallic surfaces and pipes.

### Synthetic Rubber Paint

This paint is made from dissolved synthetic resins, and can include pigments. It has a moderate cost and its main benefits are chemical resistance, fast drying and weather resistance. Synthetic rubber paint is used for concrete surfaces in general, and this includes fresh concrete.

### Cellulose Paint

Cellulose paint is produced from celluloid sheets, amyl acetate and photographic films. Adhesion can be improved by adding castor oil, and surfaces can be easily cleaned and washed once the paint has dried. This type of paint is characterized by its quick drying, smooth finish and hardness, while offering resistance to water, smoke and acids. Thanks to its properties, cellulose paint is commonly used in cars and airplanes.

The main disadvantage of cellulose paint is its high price.

### Plastic Paint

This paint uses water as a thinner, and it is available in a wide range of colors. It dries very quickly and offers high coverage. The following are some common applications:

* Walls and ceilings of auditoriums, showrooms, display rooms, etc
* Slabs
* Decks

### Silicate Paint

Silicate paint is made from a mixture of silica and resinous substances. Its performance benefits include good adhesion, hardness, heat resistance, and being chemically unreactive with metals. Therefore, this type of paint is commonly used in metal structures.

### Casein Paint

This paint is made from casein mixed with white pigments. It is available in powder and paste form, and pigments can be added. Casein paint is commonly used to paint walls, ceilings and wood."

The psychiatrist that even if he didn't intend to give me tranquilizers, most drugs work that way. When they try to control one chemical in our brain, it affects other chemicals too which makes us feel sleepy. So, you still have to take them regularly.

Call up your friends and family members to see if you can find a Pandit or Tantrik who can perform pooja for your brother at his place. Anything which does not require your brother to be present. I understand that handling such people is very difficult. But talking in a low but firm voice, smiling instead of shouting, may help you get a positive response sometimes."

* consult a psychiatrist and check if he has mental disorders,
* get him checked medically and keep an eye on him to see if he is using drugs, and
* consult some spiritual masters in your contact to see if his problem is related to Kundalini or Chakra.

Keep an open mind but do not believe anyone blindly. He may have one, two or three of these problems."

AdoptiveParents,fqgjegw,t3_gir6q8,1589347852.0,"I adopted a daughter when she was about three months old. She is now 14. I am still surprised how people are against adoption. For me (and for my daughter), adoption is just one more process of completing a family. Some people give birth, some opt for IVF, some adopt. The only condition I had in my mind was that I wanted to adopt a child from a trusted agency. I wanted to be sure that my child was with the agency for valid reasons and was not stolen. Those who say that I am not a complete woman, I smile and say my aspiration was always to be a good human being first.

If  you are clear that you are adopting for the right reasons - to love and care that every child deserves - you don't have to bother about what others think."
Paranormal,fqgio43,t3_gibs00,1589347288.0,That is possible. I have a few memories from three of my  past lives. I believe reincarnation is possible. You might love a visit to your mom's hometown sometime.
AdoptiveParents,fqgcakt,t1_fqdkxkq,1589342711.0,"If OP is in open adoption, it's okay to interact with the birth mom. But in the case of closed adoptions, I do not advice including her in your parenting decisions. Different people have different ways of coping. She might not be ready for it and feel hurt or guilty - which might not be good for her right now."
AdoptiveParents,fqdjywp,t3_ghzeck,1589291272.0,"I think that the best way would be to talk to her. Tell her that you want her to be your daughter and feel that you can give her a stable family and unlimited love as a mom. Tell her that you think you are now in a position to give her what she deserves. Ask her what she wants. If she tries to be disrespectful, just tell her (several times on different occasions) that you will always 'want' her and will be there for her. That you are waiting for her. And leave at that. Wait till she comes to you. Teenage is a difficult period. Trying to force her into a change of her status may disturb her at the moment - but knowing that you have her back will give her hope and help in healing her. Best of Luck!"
AdoptiveParents,fqdhqpa,t1_fqdhfr7,1589289929.0,"And yes, I always share the story of why I chose the name I gave her as well as what her birth name means. They are both good names. But her birth name sounded too old to us. She does not care. Lol!"
AdoptiveParents,fqdhfr7,t3_gi2c62,1589289742.0,"I don't see a problem in that. I renamed my 2.5 month old daughter when I adopted her and she is fine with it. She will turn 15 next January. She knows her birth name - and it's not even her middle name (because we don't generally have middle names here). If she wants to find out her birth history, she has her birth name. If she wants, she may change it later legally. But right now, she is happy with the name we gave her. It's not like your 3-month old baby is already associating herself with some name and would be horrified if you change it.

At other times, they fail. Because, as you said, they are caught up in their own lives, situations, moods, opinions. The key here is to be your own best friend. Have a friend within you. You will never be afraid to share your secrets with yourself and can always be confident that you will take care of yourself. You cannot place this confidence in others. If not 'you', then the God. Whatever suits you according to your religious beliefs. We only feel sad or hurt, when we are 'expecting' something from others. Once this expectation is gone, you only shrug off the way others react even if you don't agree with it. Because it is what they are doing. It takes a long, long time to decide that you are going to be your most beloved person and to promise yourself that you will always take care of yourself. It takes several years of practice.

As far as I know we have control over most things in our body and for things we can't control, perhaps you may work to change your perception towards it.

So, I always kept an eye that he doesn't accidentally puts his legs over my baby too as he is a heavy sleeper. Lol! Didn't get much sleep in those days. We never bought a crib but those who do, use it only in the daytime. It is usually kept in an area from where the mom and others in the family can always keep an eye on the child  and talk to her/him. Things are changing now. But that's how it used to be. The important point here is that those who sleep with babies don't drink or don't use medicines that may make them sleep heavily because it may cause accidents with a baby in bed."

But I think you are more stable and may be able to complete both your child and your mom by being a bonding factor between them. But if you feel that your mom can hurt your child, of course, you will have to take a tough decision and prioritize your child over your mom.

This man was nurtured by my father. He hired him, trained him, treated him as his younger brother, fed him for three years and this man tried to get him murdered twice, discredit him at workplace, and got me (only daughter of my father) abducted to try and pressurize him into leaving the job.

My father was a self-made man. He came from a poor background and could not leave the job. That man had a problem with my father because my father was a very honest man and was the branch manager at the time. If he died or left the job, the man could make big bucks. He did that when my father moved to the new position.

He directly insulted my father several times and made fun of him. He was a snake. I hate him and I wish the darkest doom on him. But once he moved to the new job, my father always told me to not hold the grudge against him. He always told me to forgive him and to be kind. He used to say,

""If he is wrong, God will find a way to punish him. Why do you curse him? Even if he did something wrong, I considered him as my younger brother once. I will never want him to suffer.""

Paranormal,fopvylq,t1_fopvc8x,1587973950.0,I don't understand what you are trying to say.
Paranormal,fopvwbd,t1_fopqvxt,1587973890.0,"I don't know how he used the phone of course. My father was in media, had a good reputation all around because he was so honest and friendly, and back then, people were not suspicious of each other I guess. Plus, when he couldn't find his friend, he went to the cops first and told them everything. He must have been neat and clean as he went from home and maybe cops decided that he couldn't do it. Plus, my father was shocked after that and cops may have sensed it. I don't know. I was not old enough to have too many first-hand memories."
Paranormal,foplcoc,t1_fopkkbp,1587964590.0,Yes. My father was very close to his friend. He had few friends but they were all very close. This friend's pregnant wife and mother were at home alone at the time. Probably why he called my father for help.
Paranormal,fopjdow,t3_g8la3n,1587963041.0,"My father was a journalist. In 1980-81, I was around 2-3 years old and he would be around 30. He was a hard-working and honest man with a lot of good friends. At 2 am, we received a call on our big black landline phone. It was his friend who had got in an accident on a highway. He said he was calling from a 24-hour STD booth near the site. The friend also asked him to bring a big white bedsheet for him.

At the time, there were no mobile phones. So, my father set out alone in a jeep and took a water bottle with the bedsheet. My parents were wondering what the bedsheet was for.

My father reached the site. There were no streetlights and he couldn't find his friend or his scooter. He couldn't find the STD booth too. So, he travelled for 5 more kms and found a police station. He contacted the cops there and told them the story. The cops took big torches and went with him in search of his friend.

Finally, they found the scooter slid down on one side of the highway with the middle part of his body cleanly slit down horizontally. He had been dead for more than five hours!

My father had received the call after his friend's death! It was then it hit my father that in our region, the white bedsheet is used to cover the dead body. We call it 'kafan'. Perhaps, the friend was hinting that he was dead and the white bedsheet will be required to cover his body.

My father couldn't sleep for weeks and hated to talk about the incident."
Paranormal,fophpqv,t1_fofhqxp,1587961787.0,"I saw that in movies. I have heard of people who can take care of black magic but if your grandma is already a witch, it might be difficult to handle her. You might have to overturn the whole house, clean it, throw away anything that seems odd, place religious symbols everywhere. In Hinduism, we believe in doing havan and lighting diyas to dispel darkness and chanting God's name. You can do anything that fits with your religious views. Wash everything - walls, floor, ceiling. Advise everyone in the family to visualize a shield of pure white light protecting you from evil for 10 minutes after waking up and before going to sleep. I hope your life becomes better. I will pray for you and your family."
Paranormal,fofhgrq,t3_g7628i,1587735978.0,"In movies, they show church can help you fight demons. But I am not Christian. No harm in asking someone for help. One more thing, if you can inherit witch ability, perhaps you can try visualising a white light ball enveloping you to shield you from such dark forces."

Paranormal,foe8hti,t1_focwwtl,1587698187.0,"If you cannot stop them, the only way to go is to investigate them and try to find out what you can do now. If you are feeling tired, you need to find a way to have some good rest. Check if you can go to sleep in your dream as the other person - and what it leads to. Perhaps, taking a day off in your dream or calling sick for  a day in your dream allows you to have some rest. Living long on short naps don't seen healthy to me. Other way is trying to do meditation and find ways to have a better control over your little superpower."
Paranormal,foe86b6,t1_fobwzz9,1587697995.0,"Perhaps, she is trying to protect you or contact you."

Paranormal,fobqaaa,t3_g67h5j,1587662496.0,"Interesting! That was a pretty good idea. Sending yourself a friend request. If the person whose life you live doesn't feel bad, may be you can accept the request and interact with him/her. Who knows keeping in touch with all these people help you see patterns with time. Do you feel rested after having these dreams or not?"

SpiritualAwakening,fnlzmwx,t3_g2gmdv,1587062517.0,I wouldn't believe it. But I remember snippets of three past lives - one as a gorilla - and people don't believe me either. So who am I to judge you? But if it is true...I wish you knew where is this Earth?

aurareadings,fndlidm,t1_fnd7k3i,1586872676.0,"Yeah..that's something unusual. At one point of time, I used to sit for meditation and see a circle of dark purple aura around me and feel it as solid - as if I am in a giant zorbing ball. It pulsated too. But that was when I had my eyes closed. It was not like what you are experiencing. I can't visualize it now though."
Paranormal,fnczmr8,t3_g0r50i,1586852949.0,Not always. Never happened to me until I saw my friend's mom who appeared in my dream just after she died and gave me a message for her family. This was the only time I saw a dead person and knew for sure that this was not my flight of fantasy.

I have been depressed since 12. Soon, I will be 42. At times, I become dysfunctional. At other times, I do a good job at home and at work. I only focus on trying to keep myself steady and tune others out.

I know they will never understand."

abusiverelationships,fmsavxe,t3_fwzfks,1586351381.0,"As a victim of abuse myself, I have learned one thing. The cycle never stops until we harden up and learn to control our impulse of being understanding and kind to our abusers (or people like them). Just as abusers can't learn how to be kind and loving and caring, we abuse victims find it hard to learn how to protect us from being duped emotionally and financially. It's your time to learn, girl. My hugs to you. I hope you heal well."
