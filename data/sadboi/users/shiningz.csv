curlyhair,fqplil7,t3_gk8y0s,1589549165.0,"After years of thinking that I should accept that my hair is just a wild frizz, last night I decided to give this a shot. I didn't really do it perfectly as I didn't have a lot of curly friendly products available, but here is the ""routine"":

Hours before showering I smothered my hair with coconut oil. I PUT IT EVERYWHERE.

Then I washed my hair with Marc Anthony's Strictly Curls shampoo, and applied my normal Elvive L'Oreal hair mask (didn't have anything else) and instead of rinsing it off with water like I always did, I squished to condish and I could see the curls forming! It was fun. When I was done, I squished some more to remove the excess water.

Half dried it with a microfiber towel (kinda just put it there on my head) and let it air dry for an hour or two as I wasn't in a rush. I put some Garnier's coconot leave in conditioner in my hair using the same fun method and then did the pineapple (and loved it) and wrapped it in the microfiber towel and went to bed.

Then I woke up to this and I'm so excited! I know I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for lurking on this sub, so THANK YOU!"

I've improved a lot and It's amazing. It obviously doesn't cure bpd but I feel like it lifted me up from a really dark place. It's like my head's above the water now."

Very well said, basically what I was thinking about the recent posts.

It's important to remember that we all experience BPD differently and we're all in our own unique situations and saying things like we're condemned to suffer forever is neither helpful nor true.

Thank you for your post."
BPD,fpy6n2u,t3_gg4gkm,1588997161.0,"This is my (and I think a lot of people's) safe place, the ONLY place where we're not judged and invalidated. I think anyone should be able to express themselves freely.

I don't think we're sentenced to stay miserable babies like you put it and I'm sorry you feel that way but I personally have and know a lot of people who have managed to improve a lot, by obviously long term therapy but also acceptance, self-awareness and learning more about the disorder, any aspect of it."
BPD,fpwqi1r,t3_gfwp3i,1588968114.0,"I'm not sure, but whenever I see others write about feeling like they're bothering someone if they text first or hate the way they look or feel like nobody loves them and they're alone I can't really relate. My main struggle has always been turning people (that I subconsciously flirt with) down or being overwhelmed with too many texts and DMs from different people and honestly I think I'm attractive and even during my worst episodes and moods, it appears that I don't have that self-esteem thing that appears to have to be a bpd thing.

I'm guessing I might have narcissistic traits, but I definitely have a lot of empathy and don't manipulate people on purpose or emotionally torture them to feel better. I've been reading a lot about the differences between NPD and BPD and they do overlap sometimes, even though they are different things and the issues stem from other things.

I get your point about the self awareness thing, apparently NPDs are not supposed to be able to self reflect and analyse things or even come close to accepting that they might be wrong. Maybe we have some traits and not the actual thing too?"

My only stable and non abusive relationship was with someone who took care of me in every aspect (although probably crossing healthy levels as he was codependent) and as time went by, I noticed that unconsciously, even the way I speak to him is like a kid (freaking baby talk!) and he called me the tiny one or hazelnut or other affectionate nick names for little kids and I loved all the attention and how I didn't have to worry about life and every little thing.

This is why I loathed starting therapy too, I knew the minutes I start to tell my story I'll be crying my eyes out. My therapist noticed how my voice and lips shake and how I'm trying to keep it together and told me to just let go and it FELT SO GOOD to be allowed to express myself.
