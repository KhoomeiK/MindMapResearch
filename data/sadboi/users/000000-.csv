Like I’ve had lots of Lion’s who didn’t even utilize passive mana regen lmao. They will just stand with full mana and wait for god knows what to cast their stun.  
  
Really basic advice to supports:  
1. Buy regen and always trade with enemies, don’t save up mana and don’t wait until you’re full hp.  
2. Don’t hit enemy creeps as that pushes the lane and don’t aggro them when you attack enemies. Issue an attack order far from the enemy creepwave so that the creeps don’t start attacking you.  
3. Learn to pool, it’s very easy and most players on Herald 5 don’t counter that. It may sound like an advanced move but it’s really simple and helps a lot."

Yes, they got -600 because people discovered a huge flaw. However WePlay was loved by almost everyone here and that 1) won’t totally change because of one issue, 2) the post won’t be seen by most people.  
  
So if someone simply says “fuck WePlay” as a reply to a post on how a team changes lots of players on their tournament, then the comment would get downvoted as it doesn’t make sense. Yeah, they don’t have the best rules but I don’t think they can change them during the tournament and I don’t think they established these rules just to let team YOLO abuse them and win as a result. They simply came up with suboptimal rules, which is understandable as many teams would need substitutes during those times (look at OG) and even before the pandemic many online tournaments didn’t really care about substitutes (e.g. Sqreen’s team on Parimatch League and many others).  
  
Is it really WePlay’s fault that they YOLO want to get Cr1t as a substitute? Nobody would care if they changed around several tier 3 players but when it’s Cr1t, somehow it’s WePlay’s fault that they didn’t come up with good rules. No tournament had rules restricting an especially skilled player to stand in for a team."

He could be lying but I’m not sure if it could even be called an issue, especially as both ESL and WePlay have invited B8 which most definitely don’t deserve the slot. People can disagree with invites but it’s not an “issue” especially not the same kind as the first three listed above."

DotA2,fpcj5av,t3_gcmg5a,1588502488.0,"*TL;DR at the bottom*
  
I have a solution. I don’t know if it’s universal but 100% works for me:  
  
**Restart Dota after each match.** Like 80% of time the same happened to me IF I didn’t restart. Hasn’t ever happened once I figured it out.   
  
Some more useful info: I have a garbage laptop and play on lowest possible setting. Even got banned because I kept getting abandons because I couldn’t load fast enough into the games. This was caused by updates but some newer patches improved my performance a bit.  
  
At some point I could play but I had to ask for a pause at the start (like 30-40 seconds) and still had a significant chance of failing to load.  
  
**What helped me:** I’ve always ended all of the non-essential processes, even *explorer.exe*. It was not enough though, so the solution is:  
  
Create a shortcut of steam.exe,  RightClick the shortcut, click Properties,   
click on the  ‘Target’ field and add   
  
> -no-browser +open steam://open/minigameslist  
  
You should add this exact text AFTER quotation marks, so that the ‘Target’ section would look like this: ...Steam\steam.exe” -no-browser +open...  
  
This shuts down all of the unnecessary steam processes, like Store, which allowed me to join matches in the first 10-15 seconds of the game which is huge! I’ve never had problems loading into the game ever since I did this.  
  
TL;DR: This exact problem was fixed at least for **me** by restarting Dota after every match.  
  
If you have a low-end PC — run a mini version of Steam (read my full comment if it’s relevant to you)."
DotA2,fp979xt,t1_fp91nxm,1588417055.0,"It’s a pretty interesting concept but I think it’s too specific as the hero doesn’t have proper spells for the laning stage nor can he do anything outside friendly/enemy tower range except place his own tower.  
  
Your concept reminded me of mine which I came up with like 2-3 years ago and I don’t remember it so well. It revolves around the powers of the Ancients (the structures, not neutrals) — towers, creeps etc.   
  
One of his abilities would be to spawn a creepwave and/or to buff creeps or teammates with attackspeed, damage or something. One of his abilities would allow him to teleport just like with Town Portal Scroll (kinda lika NP but chanelled, different cd, manacost, destinations (tp/tp/BoTs/BotS 2 or something like that depending on balance)). Also he’d have a passive or long cd active (like drow’s Precision Aura used to work) which gives gold for every lasthit allied creeps do. Obviously it would be a small fraction of the gold — everything can be balanced. And an ability that revolves around glyph.  
  
So I’m just gonna come up with some simple numbers so you’d get an idea of what does the hero do:  
  
On the laning stage he helps his carry with Glyph, which makes the hero immune to any damage (Or like 50/60/70/80% damage protection) for like 3 seconds or 2/3/4/5 seconds. Maybe gives attack speed or damage too. CD and manacost don’t matter at this point.  
  
To make it more interesting it’s used in a small AoE, like 200-300 (think Maledict) so you may even miss it. However the small AoE can be used to buff multiple heroes/creeps (which you can spawn). Also it would probably give creeps a bigger buff, like 4/6/7/8 seconds of invulnerability or higher damage buffs. 
  
This ability is great for pushes (if you use it on creeps) but at the same time it’s *very* good in teamfights (so it’ll probably have a big CD).  
  
TP ability allows the hero to rotate during laning stage to save teammates with Glyph and in mid/late game it helps with pushing and splitpushing which is what the hero mainly does.  
  
The passive gives 4/7/10/13% (?) of gold from any lasthit allied lane creeps make. It’s a suitable ability for a support as you aren’t stealing any farm, you get gold that would otherwise be simply wasted. A global or long-range buff to creeps can be put into this ability as an active components, just like Drow’s Precision Aura a year ago.  
  
This ability helps you passively get farm to get supporting or aura items for your team so that your pushing capabilities improve over time.  
  
Ult spawns a creepwave. Now, idk how to balance it but here are a few variables:  
The creepwave either does or doesn’t include a catapult.  
Lvl 6 creepwave is normal, lvl 12 is super creeps and lvl 18 is mega creeps.  
Could be done so that even lvl 6 is super creeps and then on lvl 12 a catapult is added.  
They are either uncontrollable like lane creeps and are spawned only on lanes OR they focus the same target as you (party controllable)  
They give full or half the bounty to enemies.  
Also the cooldown affects the balance A LOT. It could be a 30 sec CD ability or 160 sec CD ability or anything in between, depending on balance.  
Also the ult could passively give all of the creeps in 1600~ range some dps/hp/magic resist buff.  
  
So the hero gets some gold from his passive, uses it to get pushing/support items and pushes with the creepwave from his Ult which he Glyphs.  
  
Sorry for a wall of text lol"

sex,fn43npr,t1_fn3u040,1586633401.0,"Okay may I ask how these things absolutely aren’t/can’t be dealbreakers to you but at the same time you refuse to talk about them?  
  
I’m not saying that everyone should talk about it. However when two people are in love they talk *a lot* and they talk about each other pretty often too. So any topic from the past may come up.   
  
So I don’t see how exes won’t get mentioned when you talk about someone’s past. Or do you mean one-time hookups? It’s not really interesting but it may still come up.   
  
So why is it something you don’t want to talk about? I mean it’s you, your SO will accept it no matter what. As you said, your value isn’t tied to the amount of men you slept with (which I agree with). But it still tells you something about a person so why hide it?  
  
I personally won’t break up with someone I love because of the number (no matter if 1 or 50). However if they hide it then I won’t understand the reason behind it. They can have secrets but why exactly should the amount of partners be a secret? Especially if it’s obviously clear that they won’t be judged for the number. So could you explain your point?"
sex,fn3w850,t1_fn3m8qp,1586629132.0,"Lmao. Why not? It could be said with an intent to hurt someone’s feelings but it doesn’t have to. Of course you shouldn’t compare your partner’s and your exes’ dicks just out of blue. However if it *somehow* comes up, why should she hide it?  
  
Is she satisfied with it? If yes, then what’s the problem with the fact that her exes simply happened to have bigger penises? Someone’s gotta have a bigger penis than you and that’s nothing to stress about. It’s just a simple fact which and it would be stupid to feel hurt because of it.  
  
Now if she isn’t satisfied then it could be a problem. However it doesn’t have anything to do with the whole topic of exes. It’s just that the guy can’t satisfy his SO."
sex,fn3l8bp,t1_fn3ga8a,1586622983.0,"So it’s better to live a lie? Or to postpone the question? Because it *may* come up sometime in the future by a person that “can’t handle it”. If it can become a dealbreaker once it’s known, then I’d say was pretty important all along and one or both partners want to discuss it.  
  
So either live a lie, lie to a partner, or be heartbroken? Or maybe just accept each other for who they are, share things with each other and live happily?"

Psychology won’t help you here so you’ve gotta come up with something on your own because what you do depends completely on your situation.  
  
You can either:  
1) Lie and present the idea as bad. Something like “turns out most beginner businessmen fall for this and lose lots of money!”. However it should be convincing and related to some teal facts.  
  
2) Tell them that you want to use this idea and don’t want to be competitors for X reason. If they’re close enough they’ll drop it.  
 
3) Live with consequences of sharing a good idea to someone you aren’t that close with"
