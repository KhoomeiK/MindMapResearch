changemyview,f60bdlf,t3_dpdqe1,1572612448.0,100% agree ! I grew up on ps3 minecraft with my cousins . But recently while playing with them again I realized that it's nearly impossible to have a good world . Some people wanted to grief or build or explore or mine even though we all agreed to get all the trophies . In the end I was the only one to get all the trophies since most of them left because they were bored . It sucks because minecraft is a great game when everyone has similar play styles.
