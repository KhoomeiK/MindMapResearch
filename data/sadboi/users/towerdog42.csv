I learned that even though they tout you being able to have a life outside of the classroom, you don't. You have to be available 24/7 for your ""teammates"" to contact you and ask you a stupid question like, ""how is that paragraph that you are responsible for on the paper due in 3 weeks coming along?"" And heaven forbid it's the summer and you oh I dont know want to take a holiday weekend to go camping and fishing. Well, then you should have done all of the work for the next week before you left. 

I also learned that citing your sources in APA format differs from person to person.  I had several papers get docked because I didnt do the correct APA formatting of my sources. One time my ""professor"" (pretty sure it was some smelly dude living in his mom's basement - I'm sorry the command center) sent me a revised version of my citations so I could reference that on my next paper, I essentially copied and pasted the format on the next submission and he told me I still did it wrong. 

I also learned how to properly educate myself by way of correctly wording a boolean search through google. I sure as hell didnt learn anything about operations management or integrated supply chains from my instructors. It's a shame I missed this by 4 or 5 years. Oh well."

As always, be well."
mentalhealth,f7a7edn,t1_f7a4xm1,1573522305.0,"Well, first off, there is something that you and your therapist have in common. You are both human, and prone to being wrong on occasion.  I'm an engineer. Being wrong is like 75% of my job. But let's flip the script a bit shall we? What happens when you get a wrong answer on a test? Do you forget what you have learned, or do you look to your teachers and the course material for the right answer? If you think your therapist is wrong, do you tell her, or do you roll your eyes and move on to the next subject? My therapist went right into how I was unhappy because at the time I was just an operator and she thought that I was to smart for mechanical assembly. She didnt know who she was dealing with. I told her that her original assessment was wrong. Actually I think I quoted Steve Buscemi from Armageddon. But I digress. When I told her how much I loved my job, she realized that my problems and unhappiness were not stemming from work, they were coming from my home life. Then we were able to get into the meat and potatoes of the whole ordeal. Initial assessments arent always right. Sometimes us as the patients/clients whatever need to take the reins and say ""this is what I think the problem is."" If you want to be successful in life and you think that in order to do that you have to do well in school? Who am I or anyone else for that matter to judge that belief? Back it up with facts. What do you want to be? What will it take to become that person? What will it take to shape that future of success? 

Suicidal thoughts to put it bluntly, blow donkey dick. They really mess with everything, they can take a great day and turn it into an absolute shit pile. But that is just that day. Let me repeat that so it sinks in. It is only for that day. It is only for that moment. If you dont act on it (and I really pray that you never do) you have beaten it for that moment. And you are stronger for having done so. If it takes a day to recover then tomorrow is just another day, another chance for you to be better, another shot at getting stronger. As long as you keep fighting. And when you feel like you can't fight anymore, that's when you call for help. CALL FOR HELP. I dont care if it's the prevention line, your therapist, the pastor at the church down the street that you've never met. CALL FOR HELP. 

Humans apart from being wrong sometimes, are pack animals. We do not do well on our own. And being lonely,  you can probably sense that. I dont have the answers Amigo. The best I can offer is life experiences.  I have always felt better when I have reached out to others. 

I stand by my original statement though. You can do this. The power to overcome is within us all. Some people can bring that power out on there own, others need a little nudge, and others still need someone to reach down into the muck and pull with all of their strength to get them out. That being said, maybe a support group as an addition to therapy might help? It might be beneficial to have someone who has been there and gotten through it with the help of others to talk to. Ask your therapist if she knows of any support groups that you could attend. That combined with your sessions with her might really get the ball rolling in the right direction.

Something to think about. 

Hang in there amigo. You got this."
mentalhealth,f7a47gm,t3_dv0th8,1573519930.0,"Amigo, I hope you dont mind but I did a little digging (yeah i dug through your profile and post history). You've got nothing to worry about. You know that old saying (and if this old guy is saying it's old, you know its old) you've got your whole life ahead of you? Well you do. Take it from someone who is probably in the midst of a mid life crisis, you'll be fine.  I know right now it looks bleak. I spent most of my youth friendzoned and I know I've missed out on the greatest relationships mostly because I was a mess. If I knew 15 years ago what I know now, my life would be immensely different. 

One of my favorite quotes is, ""love is not love, which alters as it alteration finds."" Love is a cruel mistress (or mister, I don't judge). She'll drive a wedge between family, friends, nations, but then she'll turn around and bring us all together in our darkest moments. 

If you really want someone to listen, you have to listen to yourself first. You took a HUGE step by putting your stuff out there for a bunch of strangers to read. Now the next step, is to take a good look at your stuff, and listen to what it is saying. If you think asking this community for advice is scary, the worst is going to be asking yourself what is best for you. I'm saying that to prepare you for some scary shit. I know, I'm in the middle of it too. My relationship (10 years) is on the rocks, I have to confront my father, and to top it off, I still have to work 50 hours a week to make ends meet. I am scared shitless (pardon the language) of what the outcomes are going to be. 

But that is where help comes in. If you are honest with yourself, and can be open with yourself, you will find that opening up to a therapist is a helluva lot easier.  Remember a therapist isn't there to give you the answers. He or she is there to help guide you down the path that will keep you level or even keel. Looking for help from significant others is OK for a little bit, but you end up in a codependent relationship and that just isn't healthy. A therapist is an unbiased third party. They aren't there to take your side in an argument, they are there to find a resolution to that argument. If you are arguing with yourself on certain matters, they are going to help you resolve that argument. Sometimes,  you win, sometimes you lose. But to give you my favorite quote of all times, from the great Mick Jagger,  ""you can't always get what you want,  but if you try sometimes, you'll find, you get what you need."" 

I hope this helps. It's scary in our minds, I know. But don't give up. Being courageous isn't the absence of fear, it is being afraid and doing what needs to be done. You can do this chief. Take your time. Bite it off in small chunks if you have to. Let your therapist know what you are doing. Tell them, ""hey I want to work on _____"" ""and I can only do a little at a time, because it is hard AF."" They'll understand.  If you feel rushed, let them know. You're at the helm of your ship, you have the map, they have the navigational tools. Just be sure to listen when they give you some directions.

Be well Amigo."

My father who is a huge Stephen King fan always had a hard time with the movies, because of the amount of inner dialogue that happens with the main character.

Get a nice haircut, get a fun shirt, do the dishes, scrub the toilet, and then build off of those seemingly meaningless tasks. Before you know it, your house will be clean, and you will have a renewed sense of accomplishment and another positive thing to focus on. 

I struggle with this immensely, and have turned to journaling my to do list. That way when I get something done, I can read about it later and see if I've progressed at all. And if I don't get it done,  I can add it to the list for the next day.

A lot of things can be connected to our mental health. For me it's my environment, for you, it seems like you really pride yourself on your achievements,  and hell, why not? When your earnings are up, you're up, when your earnings are down, well, you get the idea. 

I know money is important. I was once a broke college kid who had to do laundry in a dorm bathroom sink because I couldn't afford the laundromat; but have you tried focusing your attentions to your studies? Maybe a paradigm shift is in order.  Try priding yourself more on how well you are doing in school first, and your earnings second. You might see a shift in your thinking from I have money and my grades are good to I am crushing my classes and I make a pretty good living for a student. That way when your salary shifts, you can still say you are crushing your classes, despite eating ramen for the next too weeks.
