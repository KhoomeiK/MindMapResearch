Teachers,fp3inxf,t3_gay2it,1588279970.0,"When we closed back in March (and thought it would only be a couple weeks), the idea was thrown out. It makes sense to me—-I work in a school with ages 3-7, and they are tiny germ factories. I wouldn’t be happy that my carpeted room would be covered in spilled milk and crumbs, but what can you do? I don’t want to be the asshole that says no when they just have our safety in mind.

(Also just to add on, we don’t get lunch breaks. The only break we do get nap time but the kids are in the room.)"

I started following a person named Lorenzo (on instagram and tik tok) and they are a PhD student that is huge on making goals. So I started making a list of morning goals and afternoon goals that I needed to get done that day. It’s been super helpful because I don’t have to stick to a strict schedule (except meetings) as long as I get my goals done for the day.
Teachers,fobnrjm,t3_g6i7zv,1587661723.0,We don’t graduate in Georgia Pre-K because too many graduations make the real one when their seniors less special and important. That’s what I was told anyway.

My county has sent a letter to the governor petitioning for the closures to stay in place. Our health department is not prepared for an onslaught of testing. Many of our restaurants are not opening and only continuing with curbside service.

I know this isn’t an easy decision but this should be data based. People are going to get sick and possibly die."

Something that has helped me(besides meds) is taking a walk. I go before and sometimes after (if the day is bad) contract hours and crank up the soundtrack to a broadway musical. It helps some."

teaching,fn26yua,t1_fn1qe0r,1586579583.0,"The stopping the greeting and waving was because of COVID and we had a stomach bug going around school too.

The other part isn’t too much. It’s never too young to talk to kids about touching. For example, if one of them is poking someone and the kid tells them to stop, they need to stop. If they don’t want to be touched they have every right to tell them no. Plus, it also teaches the other kid that no means no."
teaching,fn1dwbg,t3_fx2t3p,1586559988.0,"I did something similar with my Pre-K babies. Around the end of February I stopped and we just waved.
