worldnews,fni10z4,t1_fnhy6ts,1586972166.0,"It‚Äôs not like the trump administration/federal government is doing anything anyway, theyve been pretty open about the fact they want no part in leading, they solely want to make as much cash as possible. They literally said screw u guys, fuck the constitution, fuck ur grandparents and fuck you, I‚Äôll get mine(several billion) and you just might get yours(2000 TOPS) but don‚Äôt count on it! FFS they are STEALiNG PPEs from states that need it! WT absolute FUCK this shit is batshit crazy, who in there right mind would give those fuckers another cent? I know learned helplessness is a thing but cmon, trump and the gop dgaf anymore, he does have absolute power, and Shciff ily but talk is cheap and you and your party are the incompetent ones if you think this is okay. DO SOMETHING! SOMEONE! 

     The united STATES of America should UNITE and get rid of the entire federal government and start from scratch, ditch the entire system, everything, and do it properly. 


    Sorry for all the capitals but no ones listening I enjoyed watching this shit show but it‚Äôs just sad and depressing now I feel like I‚Äôm watching a loved one continue to go back to their abusive SO and getting heartbroken only to go right back to them"

That being said tweeting is a useless talent at best and all those spelling and syntax errors are part of twitter, so yes they are recorded, but in the context of twitter, they‚Äôre pretty damn good.
