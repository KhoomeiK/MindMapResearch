DrugNerds,fp5b0wf,t1_fp58saj,1588322653.0,"Firstly, why is it out of the question? There's DNM's.

Secondly, I'll address your question directly since you're insisting. Even if you were to successfully block all the serotonin transporters on the neurons MDMA acts on, you're probably going to feel sedative side effects from mirtazapines strong potency as a H1 agonist. Maybe higher doses reduce the sedative effect but it would likely be more trouble than its worth playing around with the doses. Why not find a better serotonin antagonist?
