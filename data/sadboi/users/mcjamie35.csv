breakingmom,fehs2sl,t3_ep18ow,1579122755.0,"It gets better.  My son is 22 now, but his entire childhood was rough. He saw the school counselor regularly since his dad and I divorced when he was young. It wasn't until 8th grade that he was finally diagnosed ADD/ODD. I felt terrible that we didn't look further into it when he was a kid. We just thought he was an ass. We joke about it now, but looking back, we didn't do anything  because his father didn't want to look like a failure. We did get him services and high school was a struggle but he's going to college, working part time and lives on his own. He knows what he struggles with and has learned how to live with it. He's grown into a wonderful young man but I remember hating him when he was little and then feeling terrible about it. That sucks.

Just hang in there, if you need to take her somewhere without your husband, do it. I regret that I didn't stand up to my ex about this. 

If nothing else, try counseling for yourself... they may even have some resources that can help."

But my husband didn't do much around the house and we had a big fight about this. He pointed out to me that when he offered to help do things, I'd just get huffy and say I'd do it myself or I'd let him do it and get pissy if it wasn't done the way I wanted it. 

He started pointing it out more and more when it happens and I still have moments where I want to reload the dishwasher after he did it but he tells me I can't have it both ways, i can't bitch about not getting help and then bitch when I get it.

So, I slowly have pulled my head out and realized I was the issue.  

To OP, NTA... did your husband not have to do any chores as a kid? These are just basic life skills."

Having depression & anxiety= insecurity in my relationships, so I think I was trying to figure out how to work through some of that, after a bit of chatting she looks at me and says ""wow, you're really a raging bitch"". I just kind of sat there for a few minutes, told her that I think we're done and left. I called my EAP and told them about it. They stopped referring people to her.

depression,f5ze9vd,t1_f5zbzfy,1572574621.0,"Of course it does. He's not who you thought he was, that doesn't make it any easier but at least you've recognized that. He broke your heart and it's perfectly fine to grieve but in the long run, you are probably better off. I know it's easy for me to say that, you're in the moment, living it, feeling it and I'm not. The sooner you realize that you've given him the power to make you feel like this, the sooner you'll find yourself moving past. 

I had/have trust issues.  I used to constantly think my BF was texting other women or looking to cheat (he works in a female dominated field, so it would be pretty easy if he truly wanted to). It caused a lot of problems for us until one day, I just thought f* it. If that's the kind of a-hole he wants to be, I'm better off without him. Not to say I don't have moments of sheer panic thinking he's out doing something and then have it consume me, they are just getting fewer and farther between. 

I hate this saying... take it one day at a time, but for me that's how I live my life. My depression/anxiety doesn't let me relax enough to think or plan too far ahead so I wake up in the morning and my goal is to get thru the day and at the end I look back and go, ok..this is what happened today.
