&#x200B;

The difficulty I run into is if I am not distracted my mind will make me paranoid, and hypo-manic. The way I deal with that is by finding something that is distracting and engaging. For me that is video games. I am eating pretty healthy and I do have a regular sleep schedule, so that is good. My hypo-mania is so severe that if I even think about working out I get a big rush of energy with elements of fear. I don't see why wanting to workout would cause those emotions, but it does. Otherwise I would workout consistently as a lifestyle. I can't even take a damn shower without getting hypo-manic. The reason it is such a big deal is because when I get hypo-manic it leads to me becoming delusional and psychotic, and I don't want to go to the mental hospital again.

Please don't take this the wrong way, but if you can't express your issues to your therapist through a note I heavily doubt you can be honest with a psychiatrist.

&#x200B;

Embarrassment that you need help? It is a sign of strength to get help if you need it. I think that is respectable. The unknown can be very scary, but life and suicide both have that issue. At the end of the day we don't know what happens when we die.

&#x200B;

\> I’m scared to be in a treatment facility and have my parents/therapist/friends look down on me for it.

I highly doubt your therapist would look down on you for getting the help you need. I would even say your therapist would be glad you did. In my view your parents, and friends MIGHT look down on you either way. If you die they could say you are selfish, and weak (Not what I am saying) And if you get help they could say you are weak.  In my view they sound cruel. Even if someone is temporarily weak that doesn't mean they are going to stay that way. I was pretty much crazy after my psychotic break. I have made massive progress towards being healthy. It can take time, but if you feel broken that doesn't mean you have to stay broken.

&#x200B;

\>   I’m scared I’ll get behind in college.

I imagine that could be stressful, but even if you graduate you most likely won't be happy until you get the help you need. Basically you need your mental health to live, and graduating college won't solve your mental struggles.
