Unos dirán que es el alma o el espíritu, nuevamente hablamos de dos conceptos diferentes, como sea no voy a entrar mucho en detalles del tipo parapsicológicos o de estados de conciencia.

Yo estudié ingeniería mecatrónica así que se lo que puede hacer un cambio de frecuencias, vibraciones y de ondas electromagnéticas. Lo que simplemente hice fue tomar un casco que tenia y adaptarlo con osciladores de frecuencia para lograr un campo electromagnético alrededor de mi cabeza. 

Honestamente dudó hasta que punto *funcionó* como debía, pero lo que puedo afirmar es que aumentando la frecuencia o bajándola es posible entrar en un estado similar al viaje astral.   
¿porqué menciono la viabilidad del experimento?, porque después de haber hecho tal cosa ciertamente esa noche tuve un viaje astral tal y como lo relatan aquellos que lo hacen por meditación, ya sabes con tu cuerpo físico siendo visto por ti, viajando rápido de un lugar a otro, hipersensibilidad de los sentidos, una viveza en los colores que ves y esas cosas. Pero en mi caso además de eso por lo menos durante los siguientes meses no pude dormir bien a pesar de que solo lo realicé una vez, desarrollé un sueño mal adaptativo además de alucinaciones y un desorden mental grande. Tarde en volver a un estado ""normal"", pero es una verdad a medias y hasta cierto punto debate de risa y seriedad, yo te puedo decir eso es más real de lo que se cree. Desarmé aquel aparato pero aún tengo los diagramas de conexión, no recomiendo hacer cosas así sin previo estudio.
