Then I read some post on one of these forums that said to treat that kind of thing like it's the natural progression of plot. They figured out how to fight against the goblins, trying preposterous schemes and just not taking the combat seriously in general; but when a real challenge comes, they take off the kid gloves and deliver a no-nonsense arse whuppin'.

A tester is an additional layer of verification because someone who writes a piece of software has an intimate knowledge with it's workings, and sometimes you need the perspective of someone who will approach it as a user (with limited or no understanding of how it works). This is also because all humans have a bias; either in their favor, or in their detriment (when someone truly hates themself)

You could even abandon an entire level of the fortress and wall it off so no one tries to path in it, if you think it's too inefficient and causing fps drop.

Another way of thinking about it I find helpful is, get it working, then improve it iteratively. Get a hole in the ground for stockpiles and dwarves, then make it pretty. Build all of the necessary furniture, then later expand. Build a basic stockpile, then later split into more efficient ones.

The player should have about a 33% chance to gain an action point on any given round.

If you tune the numbers higher, you get better granularity, like if they had 20 points + 1/level, then you'd have magic arrow cost 3, lightning bolt costs 11, fireball costs 14, confusion costs 17, and time stop costs 20. That way, the spells have a built in mechanism by which they get easier the more powerful you are. Player should get a 50% chance of gaining an action point back, and if they do, a second 50% chance to see if they gain a secondaction point back.

If you have a hundred action points then all actions have points that equal their percent of a players total action points. Magic arrow might cost 6, lightning bolt 23, fireball 29, confusion 51, and time stop 89.

To answer your question, any .png spritesheet (from any source) can be used as a font. You need to create a `.font` json file that includes the width of tiles (in pixels), height of tiles (in pixels), path to the font.png, and solid color glyphindex. 

To figure out where to put them, run `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()` and put the files wherever it prints out.

nihilism,foostww,t1_fonyf3x,1587945723.0,"> Ignoring it by not letting the suffering occupy your mind resulting in further mental anguish

Ignoring it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as not letting the suffering occupy your mind resulting in further mental anguish. 

Its possible to ignore it, but then every time someone reminds you of it, you'll feel that passion slightly. It won't ever go away If you only ignore it.

I think that it's possible to let suffering occupy your mind without creating mental anguish. Consider a firefighter who must consider the suffering of others, because it is a life-or-death task they must accomplish quickly. You cannot accomplish this if you're ignoring suffering.

It is possible to come to accept (some) things which previously caused mental anguish. Death and grievance is an example; we go through many parts of the process, but we either arrive eventually at understanding, or trap ourselves in grief by choosing not to accept negatives"
