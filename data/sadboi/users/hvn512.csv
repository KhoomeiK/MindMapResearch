I think the OP was presented with an ultimatum which many married people are - *this* or divorce. I think what his wife did was probably shitty (I say probably because I have no real knowledge of the actual situation and I know from experience if his wife cheated on him, OP is writing from a place of pain and betrayal which may not allow him to be objective) but not grounds for having her parental rights revoked.

It’s so interesting to me how random women are “white-knighting” for this guy who abused his girlfriend. It reminds me of these people who write fan letters to Chris Watts and Charles Manson, you know? I just wonder the motivation. Yes, many of us wrongly suspected Shane Carey of having something to do with Heidi’s disappearance/murder, but just because he turned out to be innocent of that doesn’t negate the things he did or magically turn him into a good guy. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
