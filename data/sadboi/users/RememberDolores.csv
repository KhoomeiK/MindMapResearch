My inner child in a way died, the desperation and traumatic fears, but I still mourn who I was sometimes. The lack of awareness of the one mind and the sense of self I had. Idk. I'm learning.

""Forty-Six & 2""

Join in my, join in my child,
And listen, I've been digging through my old numb shadow...

My shadow's
Shedding skin
I've been picking
Scabs again.
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue.

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own confused and insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in.
I wanna feel the changes coming down.
I wanna know what I've been hiding in
My shadow.
My shadow.

Change is coming through my shadow.
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again.

Join in my
Join in my child
My shadow moves
Closer to meaning

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic, insecure delusions.

I wanna feel the change consume me,
Feel the outside turning in.
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured in
My shadow
My shadow

Change is coming.
Now is my time.
Listen to my muscle memory.
Contemplate what I've been clinging to.
Forty-six & 2 ahead of me.

I choose to live and to grow,
Take and give and to move,
Learn and love and to cry,
Kill and die and to be paranoid and to lie,
Hate and fear and to do
What it takes to move through.

I choose to live and to lie,
Kill and give and to die,
Learn and love and to do
What it takes to step through.

See my shadow changing,
Stretching up and over me.
Soften this old armor.
Hoping I can clear the way
By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side.
Step into the shadow.
Forty-six & 2 are just ahead of me."

space,ficayae,t1_ficag6v,1582342052.0,"This theory would have been a better reference than just defining what a black hole is with an air of certainty physicists don't even have


""In the version as originally proposed by Pathria and Good, and studied more recently by, among others, Nikodem Popławski, [4] the observable universe is the interior of a black hole existing as one of possibly many inside a larger parent universe, or multiverse.
According to general relativity, the gravitational collapse of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge, or wormhole. Schwarzschild wormholes and Schwarzschild black holes are different mathematical solutions of general relativity and the Einstein–Cartan theory. Yet for observers, the exteriors of both solutions with the same mass are indistinguishable. The Einstein–Cartan theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors generates a repulsive spin-spin interaction which is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity. Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which grows as a new universe.[5] Accordingly, the Big Bang was a nonsingular Big Bounce at which the universe had a finite, minimum scale factor.[6] Or, the Big Bang was a supermassive white hole that was the result of a supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy in our parent universe.

She could be mistaken and I havent gotten my long form birth certificate yet. It seems to be a hassle and more money than I have rn. I noticed chiron in there, represents healing right? 

Also the cluster of the conjunctions just seems so unusual visually and I've always been intense. I have PTSD from multiple assaults and so chiron makes me think maybe I'm in a karmic life. The waning crescent on my birth day also makes me feel like I'm an older reincarnation or older soul. Something to that effect. I matured very fast because I grew up in poverty and never met my dad, barely ever saw my mom, started staying home alone without sitters at 8 years old. Was violently assaulted at 11. Had years of trauma cycling and bonding and retraumatization until i finally recognized the patterns repeating and how I was meant to learn from them before they could stop. My saturn return has been recent and I know the major Saturn/jupiter conjunction is this december 21st I believe?

I'm not very familiar with all of this either. I've just been so drawn to it since my coma and more specifically my manic episode two years ago when I suddenly felt connected to my higher self even if briefly before my ego resurfaced in a paranoid and even aggressive way as if to fight for it's own existence.

In my psychosis I picked up signals and heard what sounded like distant radio talk shows and humming that sounded like people laughing in the distance. I wondered about the auditory hallucinations and mostly the sleep paralysis and vivid dreams and idea that every song and show and conversation was a divine message. And that either everything means something or nothing does. And when manic it's the first, when depressed the second. Etc.

Lyrics that ended up being my main takeaway from the whole psychotic episode 

Disillusioned: APC

Dopamine, on dopamine, on dopamine, on dopamine

We have been overrun by our animal desire
Addicts of the immediate keep us obedient and unaware
Feeding this mutation, this Pavlovian despair

We've become
Disillusioned
So we run
Towards anything glimmering

Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around, find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island

Unique voice among the many in this choir
Tuning into each other, lift all higher

Hey, how long? Oh

Dopamine, on dopamine, on dopamine, on dopamine

Willingly been re-wired by clever agents within
Looping our reflections, our obsessions draw us in
Fix and fixation, no sentience beyond

We've become disillusioned
So we dive like crows towards anything glittering

Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around, find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island

Unique voice among the many in this choir
Tuning into each other, lift all higher

That being said I become a better person after each time. Always learn a lesson and have memories of delusions or hallucinations or dreams that feel real and influence my stable mind when I've reconciled and assimilated whatever I experienced. 

It can be both but treatment is necessary
 Just a treatment that doesnt entirely deny or dismiss his reality. Because for him it IS 100 percent real. Perception is reality as far as consciousness is concerned. I always got pissed when told nothing I thought or felt was real. It's just not shared but it was real enough for me.

P.s. I stared at the sun for my January mania in 2018 during/after the eclipses and didnt get permanent damage (several times for up to 15 seconds each time) and I remember feeling like I was eating the sun and it was a cool warmth. *shrug* the weirdest thing for me is that psychosis is made up of similar ideas and beliefs and experiences across the board. But I still take my lamictal lol. I dont want to call my ex again and yell at him for drowning me doe being a witch in a past life ....

Showerthoughts,fftof1c,t1_ffs78cl,1580225592.0,"Star Trek tries to explain futuristic physical science. Star Wars discusses the ""force"" which is metaphysical. 

It is not a hard and fast distinction. But a subtle one that was shared by a professor.

Idk why it is so mind boggling to anyone...

Star Wars is all light saber fight scenes and glorified yoga and duels scenes by volcanoes and lifting x wings out of swamps.  And Star Trek is a futuristic society that deals with exploration for civilizations progress and an education of societal ethics and morality

Star Trek follows western  ideas of science and civ, Star Wars eastern enlightenment and archetypes of heroes and sages and villians... the Hero's Journey. 


But of course both have elements of fantasy. They're fiction about space travel"
Showerthoughts,ffrc75i,t1_ffr7v2g,1580155032.0,That's because it is science fantasy whereas things like star trek are science fiction. Slight distinction

bipolar,ffik645,t1_ffiguqw,1579975816.0,"It's ok. They should be sensitive to these spiritual/new age type/philosophical ways of thinking as long as they serve us and we reconcile them in healthy, metaphorical ways and don't get carried away. For instance energy work is a part of yoga and meditation.  Totally healthy. Thinking you're an earth witch who can tap into earth's consciousness by leaning against a tree and feeling the roots electromagnetic network as if it was telepathically charging you with ineffable information and healing may earn a dose increase or involuntary admission lol. They're working off check lists, they don't know better since the DSM is their bible. Psychiatry is an nascent science still and they're still relying on blind trial and error. It's dangerous. And they're so tight on time in each appt because they're squeezing so many ppl in on top of three month wait lists. All of which is exacerbated by the significant shortage of qualified psychiatrists per patient population. 

Sooooooo.... I think a marriage of eastern philosophical and metaphysical understanding with our very materialistic, physical biological psychiatry will be the key. Often times the meds are a cast that isnt meant to stay forever and can actually prevent physical improvement. If the cast is always on you'll never get to work those muscles or exercise those bones and cartilage. It can stunt healing more than help. Or worse, the labeling and belief this is chronic and manageable only with insane side effect inducing medications is only going to lock us into square pegs when we are much more fluid than that. 

I'm 30 and learning as much as I can and keeping myself in check. But still, I wont deny after all this, my stable, educated and skeptical brain still embraces the idea that the Saturn return and big white spot storm have influence over us, just as the moon does. And I have SCIENTIFIC studies for the latter. So idk. You're growing and parenting a new ego post self realization and it's time for the work. The rebuilding schemes and a health sense of self and futurity. I felt the same. But lost at first. Now I'm beginning to see it as an opportunity long overdue.

We just have to respect we will forever live with one foot in the water, keeping ourselves from diving in headfirst but also remembering the water (emotional experience) nurtures us. If we always kept both feet on the ground, we risk depression and feeling disconnected from ourselves... part of the macrocosm that is earth. One big humming interconnected web of energy and consciousness and matter. We were never separate. 

We were never ""an island""

Tbh I'd probably have a muted laugh as an automatic response to some of what she said and as far as the thread I can say I found a few objectively funny without being so much of a poke at the psychotic woman......especially the ones about the retail aspect because I work in retail and took note of the cs responses. I just think tact with the content is helpful to making the comedy less damaging and more a relief of tension 


For example 

Her customer service persona is INDESTRUCTIBLE, mad respect.

""I DON'T GIVE A FUCK, BECAUSE HE'S GONNA BURN IN HELL.""

""Okay!""

""AND YOU'RE GONNA BE DOWN THERE WITH HIM, SCREAMING IN HOLY FUCKING TERROR, FIRE AND FUCKING BRIMSTONE, DO YOU FUCKING GET IT?""

changemyview,ff46dc1,t1_ff45zqm,1579556527.0,"Yeah that I would agree isn't ok.  I thought extra breaks OP referred to would include a single break before and after lunch.as a manager I'd always allow a ten to whomever for whatever. A call, a snack, a step into sunlight, a sit down, etc.

All I'd ask when it was customer service was to go when reasonably lower volume moments came around and always to ask me first so 1. I'd know this where they went and when and 2. So I could confirm it was a convenient time for the business

Edit: I reread OP post and could see how they meant outside of the 10 commonly allowed and I def think the employer can always discriminate that. Maybe allowing it on special occasion or super dead times or during peak stress in the employee but def should never be expected to allow it regularly."
changemyview,ff41p5r,t1_ff418ta,1579553620.0,"Yeah assuming the standard 10 is allowed every 4 to 5 hrs before and after lunch in the type of work it's reasonable. And if not, there IS the lunch where they can have a smoke off the clock. 

Taking more than one 10 in those 4 to 5 hrs though  sounds like time clock abuse. As a smoker I think that's unnecessary abuse of breaks that would def be an understandable  concern for any employer. Longer shifts or shifts in fields where they'd be working in airports or on planes or in medical offices or teaching....in basically  any field where they can't leave for extended periods of time tho? Then I'd say having a nicotine patch or gum is a good idea. I'm going to be a poll worker for the elections and I have to stay in the room for all 14 hrs so I'm bringing lots of food and gonna sport a patch. Seems fair"

changemyview,ff3zq7k,t1_ff3wdoq,1579552396.0,And I specifically said if breaks are allowed at all for both.  then smokers should not be denied for what they do on their 10
changemyview,ff3zjgw,t1_ff3xqkx,1579552279.0,Amen. It's not wellbeing they give any fucks about. It's preserving their pawns in a business of warfare and weaponry so they have less costs for medical and more money for tanks and bombs. The military budget is obscene and the govt sure as fuck doesn't find it a priority to develop Medicare for all on its soil so its kinda ridiculous imo to get suddenly stingy on people who'll come back as disabled vets and then suddenly be discarded and medically neglected anyways in an underfunded VA
changemyview,ff3v48k,t1_ff3tna7,1579549515.0,"Most logical answer here. If the job allows a 10 before and/or after lunch depending on business, then if they smoke they smoke and if they don't they don't.  Their choice and right. For health and fitness... I'm a runner and I smoke. I'm dumb I know but at the same time it does zilch to my physical performance when compared to my non smoking friends who I still outrun in speed and endurance.

The world would be so much better for it. I hope to see us progress in that direction as a whole. I know it takes one person at a time to speak up and I'm battling the shameful feelings every time I share but I also feel the gravity of it lifting a little each time too... esp when supportive people such as yourself reach out with compassion in response.

I think if I was in front of her and realized she was sick while saying what she is, I'd tell her ""you're right. I think I will accept him properly then. How might I do that?"" At some point I'd try to discreetly get someone nearby to call 911 or I'd find a way to do it. It wouldnt be ideal by any means but I think that's how i would react in the moment as the bystander. As the psychotic, i think i would just feel such pressured speech and adrenalin that I'd keep talking in any capacity just because that is the nature of the urgency of psychotic thinking, esp when it's of a religious ""messiah"" or ""savior is coming"" narrative. If she thinks shes saving people, act like she is saving you. If I thought I was trying to save people and then it was being well received I'd be pacified but still continue talking until another stimulus or psychotic thought jumped into the ring with me. *shrug*

I can say that being told I was sick and needed help when manic made me

Whatcouldgowrong,fez41kw,t1_fez3bkk,1579453625.0,"But the damage you could do if you act on the assumption she is just stupid and scared when she is psychotic (her outburst is textbook btw) far outweighs the consequences of assuming a ""stupid and scared"" person is a psychotic person who needs immediate medical attention.

The first one can get someone seriously hurt if you act without tact. Most likely the psychotic individual in fact. 

 The second would only get a still-very-distressed-person assistance...."

Whatcouldgowrong,fez19vm,t1_feyc9jd,1579452979.0,"What? 

Whose comments are you referring to? If someone says they feel bad it's probably because they're considering what she must be feeling which is obviously quite bad. But that also comes with the recognition she needs immediate medical attention. 

Would you feel bad for someone who collapses into a grand mal seizure in a walmart and gets immediate medical attention? 

These are not entirely dissimilar emergencies.

By definition empathy is feeling what the other person is feeling.

Sympathy is feeling sorry for them in a manner of pity which involves no actual emotional labor or connection.

4. If the person’s behavior is frightening you:

Give the person space. Move gently to quieter, more open surroundings. Don’t crowd or rush the person.

Try to speak and act calmly. Ask what might help.

Try to stay calm and communicate simply and clearly.

If there are warning signs of a relapse, reassure them that you are seeking help for them."
Whatcouldgowrong,feytuse,t1_fexuq74,1579450437.0,"I can promise you if you were ever unlucky enough to be the ill like she is, you'd want someone to not only ""tolerate"" you but help you. You wouldn't just want it. Your life would quite literally depend on some one else's intervention. 


She has an uncontrollable biological illness that is taking a toxic toll on her body, mind and, consequently, affects those around her.

However you have a choice where she doesn't.  You can consciously choose how to respond and you're choosing to remain ignorant to the nature of her illness and you justify the lack of empathy because she seems frightening and your children may be frightened should they see her. 

in order to address her illness and outburst your suggestion is to simply make her disappear. Well I have a question for you then.

What about if your child got a football related traumatic brain injury and psychosis followed and he behaved this way because of swelling in the brain (legitimate consequence and a TMI is relatively common. 

Would you suggest to the strangers who see him in a store as he panicks that they kick in his teeth and lock him up and throw away the key? 

Or if you have a daughter and she is raped and the traumatic stress triggers a psychotic break and she displays irate psychotic symptoms like this....

Should someone see her distress and verbally abuse her despite seeing full well she isn't making lucid decisions or thinking coherently and tell her to go to hell or leave before she gets her teeth kicked in? Would you like seeing a son or daughter aggressively handcuffed in public like this and dragged out like a rabid dog all while video is taken, laughs are had and internet strangers scrutinize them and even search for other videos  of them behaving this way to further propagate that material? So that's all they'll ever been seen as?

And you? If it happens to you? What's worse. Your children seeing you behave this way? Or seeing you behave this way and being responded to by being recorded as someone tells you off, kicks your teeth in, cuffs and drags you away, and then locks you up and throws away the key?

These are people. Not rabid animals. To say she shouldn't be around civilization when you're describing it as a society that would discard the ill as if they were unwanted pests tells me that the only lack of civility here lies with your reaction. 

Please reconsider your opinion of mentally ill people and keep in mind that you and your children are absolutely NOT immune to experiencing extreme mental illness, psychosis addiction and there very well may come a day that one of you will depend on the kindness of those more empathetic than you are being right now."
