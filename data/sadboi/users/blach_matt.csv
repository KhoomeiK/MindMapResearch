OmegaWatches,evemffg,t3_cjkzuc,1564471384.0,"Yes I agree, all those sites, C&C, Hodinkee, Bob‚Äôs Watches.... they all have a nice selection but that quality of watch can be found from a trusted private seller for less. It requires a little more work, but it can be done. I used craigslist when I bought my Seamaster 2531.8. But if you have the cash to spare, C&C is a very safe way to go.

Edit: As for the watch both are very very nice. I love the texture of the white dial. The date window between 4 and 5 is awesome. To me the GMT has a little more personality. But just my opinion. Omega has a wonderful way of adding just the right amount of flare to a timepiece."

I took it to the Omega boutique and they sent it away for a few weeks. But it works like a charm now!

I haven‚Äôt been doing it long, but if you find the right person, it helps. I picked running some years ago. It doesn‚Äôt require a whole lot. And it can be really nice and relaxing. Use your friends you do have. Try and interact with them as much as possible. And maybe they can introduce you to new people. It‚Äôs a little easier to socialize when your around people you are already comfortable with. But take things one day at a time. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up.

I ended up joking the Navy and working on airplanes. It was awesome. But I wanted to achieve that original goal so bad. So I left the Navy and switched to the Army. It was tough I had to take the ASVAB again so I could be eligible for Medic. I went to basic again as an E-5. Had to go the the reserves because I only wanted to be a medic and they weren‚Äôt accepting E-5 medics. Once I started doing things in my unit I realized I wasn‚Äôt up to the task. I was a team leader doing technical intelligence training during AT and I just sucked at leading. I also have a very hard time staying consistent in the gym.
