mentalillness,fqto9u0,t1_fqtkn5h,1589642859.0,He really needs to talk to a professional xx
OCD,fqqwc47,t1_fqqvv8z,1589573134.0,But then you won’t be able to see the life drain from it’s eyes..
OCD,fqqg722,t1_fqqbsux,1589564965.0,YES.
OCD,fqndm20,t1_fqndkxp,1589492973.0,No. Just before that.

OCD,fqmz65j,t1_fqmwqnt,1589485972.0,If you need/want to talk. I’m here xx
mentalillness,fqm4spm,t1_fqm2k1i,1589471506.0,"Oh really? Wow that’s tough. That could 100% be a factor, I grew up in an on/off religious way. We were either really strict or really lenient. Me and my siblings felt scared a lot of the time for the consequences of our actions too. I really think it would be best for him to see someone xx"
mentalillness,fqlxz1x,t1_fqlv7z6,1589468104.0,That could be it? But yeah something could of happened at school as well.. It could be something as simple as being really told of for doing something “naughty” as a child.. There are so many things that could be making him feel this way but OCD definitely does that to people as well. I think when you’re in a relationship it’s always important to have each others backs? Which I’m sure you both already do.. He just needs a little bit more reassuring. I know it can be draining but definitely push him (subtlety) to see someone xx
mentalillness,fqlun4a,t3_gjkig2,1589466384.0,"Did anything happen to him as a child? It maybe stemming from something else.. The fact that he’s so worried about being a bad person, shows that he really isn’t, a mental health professional will never judge him xx"

OCD,fq10yuj,t1_fpxjof4,1589040298.0,"Luckily for me, I’m not talking to said “person” atm which means I get a break from the prodding, smothering etc. But still their presents triggers me massively!!"

mentalillness,fpezlc5,t1_fpeyaht,1588558389.0,"Vent away! Seriously, that’s what we’re here for right? You won’t find anyone who understands you as much as the people in this group. Unfortunately it’s a feeling we all know too well. As long as we keep supporting one another. We can get through anything xx"
mentalillness,fpeq0my,t1_fpepvhk,1588552494.0,"Idk what you’re going through but I hope you get through it, we’re here if you need us."

mentalillness,fpe2lks,t1_fpe2jqu,1588539108.0,Are you okay?

OCD,fow1kz4,t1_fow1gni,1588111328.0,"The solution would be for me to move out but given recent circumstances, I can’t do that yet."
OCD,fow0run,t1_fow0lrt,1588110913.0,"Yeah, that’s the point of my post? That fact that they spat at me.."
OCD,fovzmzp,t1_fovz01g,1588110337.0,I think I’m more upset about that the fact the bodily fluids possibly touched me. We don’t get along so arguments aren’t unusual for us. We’ve gone months without talking before.. It’s more the fact that this person intentionally spat at me.
OCD,formn78,t1_fomz1fv,1588014803.0,I could not like this comment enough!!! I feel the EXACT same.
OCD,fol2kvw,t1_fol2jk6,1587853641.0,Oh thank God. I thought I was going crazy.

OCD,fo0ye5t,t1_fo0tkmd,1587422128.0,"Thank you so much! Means a lot. 
I’m not 100% I honesty think I ha e a bit of everything. When I went to the doctors a couple years ago it was really based around germs. But I sort of got over it by replacing it? It turned into numbers and rituals? When I went to therapy last year, it was more because of anxiety but we try to work on my OCD as well. At this moment in time, it’s more the germs again? Sorry. Does that make sense.."
OCD,fo0o1yv,t1_fo05w4u,1587416597.0,"Hi, thank you for replying..

Idk, I’ve tried to explain my anxiety before but I feel like because they haven’t been through it. They won’t fully understand it. I think I saw someone for it when I was a child and I had therapy last year for a couple months but nothing worked haha xx"
Hair,fnz8tex,t1_fnz63p1,1587388930.0,I’ve tried tea tree oil shampoo.. I have a naturally greasy scalp. I put aloe vera in it today. It feels a bit better.
