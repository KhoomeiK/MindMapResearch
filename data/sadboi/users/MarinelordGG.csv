addiction,fo5zxsy,t3_g5mtug,1587541379.0,"Hey I react to your thread because I picked up smoking weed a few months ago when I was with my ex ( easy access since she was a heavy smoker) and after a few months of being high I am thinking about quitting too. It is bringing me a lot of mental pain and numbness at the same time and I can’t think clearly. Would you say It would get better quickly after I completely quit? I am quite dependant on it to get some sleep to be able to work the following day so it’s not easy. But my profession is « intellectual » and I feel like weed is destroying my brain. 
Thanks for your story and congratulations for quitting. I feel inspired to do the same ! Thanks mate.

Edit: just to be clear, I smoked a lot in my teenage years and have already quit until like 6 months ago. But back then I didn’t feel as shitty."

addiction,fllbs6q,t3_fpdnrc,1585257325.0,"Really bad. I’ve been dealing with severe depression and insomnia for the last few months and my new day to day life is : I wake up at 7am, I drink 1 or 2 cups of coffee and smoke cigarettes while watching youtube to wake up , start coding ( i work full time but now from home obviously) until 6 Pm then I will just smoke joints and get as high as I can while I play street fighter with a friend online or watch youtube/ netflix. Then I go to bed, put Netflix and a joint and just smoke until I fall asleep. Obviously after a few months in I developed a resistance to the effects so I cannot sleep anymore and I basically don’t even eat everyday.I have food and money to buy some, I just don’t have the appetite nor the courage to cook.

So yeah, 15 cigarettes a day, 2 to 3 joints every evening ( if week-end or day off, can and will probably be more) and eating crap, drinking Monster and coke.. I am probably killing myself fast lol"

cats,fhln77m,t1_fhlectv,1581702525.0,"I do know he doesn't, just don't know how. I can pick him up ( if i am fast enough lol ), he doesn't fight it most of the times but he doesn't really like it so I usually just give him a kiss and put it down gently so he can leave if he pleases. When he rubs or come to me I always reach a hand gently and rub him slowly head to tail and he turns around and leaves then comes back to hit his head against my hand / arm and I re do it, then he meows and runs away lol. So I do reach out everytime I get a chance but never force and he always leaves."
cats,fhldhcr,t1_fhlb7zk,1581699282.0,"Yea he is, where I live shelters are obligated to provide vaccines and neuter every cat they get ( that's why here we pay a fee when we adopt an animal ) so he is on point at this level too. I will keep trying to buy new toys then lol.."
cats,fhlalwa,t1_fhl8niw,1581697957.0,"Thanks for your answer, it is good to see a little hope here and there.. I actually like to sit down on the floor with a handful of toys and try really hard to show him love and attention. I randomly get out of my room and go hug him or just patt him if I don't want to disturb him. I am trying to be very patient but so far nothing works and it's becoming more and more overwhelming each day...  


Concerning the traits, I figured he is a talker the first day I got him. But actually he sounds more like depressed / anxious and needy. He is from a pretty standard breed ( the grey striped kind you see everywhere on the streets ). But I still don't get why he runs when I give him attention.."
cats,fhla04n,t1_fhl9fe5,1581697683.0,"No offense intended but... did you read through the post ? I try to play with him at least a full 30 mins when I get back from work and only stop when he is not interested and I have to give up to not mentally breakdown.. If it was so easy i wouldn't have posted here haha, I did buy the laser pointer first day he arrived and he gets bored after 5 min. I put random treats in my appartment, make him run to the pointer then point the treat, he ""catches"" the pointer and gets the treat and that can work 10 min but after that he just sits and watch the laser.."
cats,fhl7fzm,t1_fhl6qb7,1581696482.0,"I thought about adopting a second cat, but if it doesn't work, I am stuck with 2 tornados instead of one.. I have seen very mixed opinions about this.  


Yea I figured but when I come to him to play ( like today, I work remote sometimes), he just lays down watching the toy and never moves. So I just get tired of waving some random toy for nothing. He just stares at me like "" wtf are you swinging this shoelace"" , when I come to him and just sit near, he comes to rub once on my elbow with the tip of his tail and runs back to where he was..."
cats,fhl7579,t1_fhl66ec,1581696346.0,"I thought about that of course, but how can I help it ? I can't just stop working lol. I am planning to get an appartment near my work to limit my time commuting and be home sooner but I am stuck until August of this year before I can break my rent and go elsewhere. If he feels lonely and needs my attention, why doesn't he respond to my stimuli  then ? How can I build more interaction ? I literally read EVERY article about cats online and asked 2325235 questions to the vet. I spen,d hundreds in toys / stuff / furniture for him. I am trying really hard."

This is my progression so far : 92 days : 

\-B world boss

\-TOA  100 completed, didn't go further than 33 in auto in TOAH tho

\- GB10 1:33 best but around 1:40 in average with (L)Sig 6\*, lushen 6\*, bella 6\* vero 6\* shannon 5\*

\- DB10 2:24 but around 2:24  in average with (L)Verde 6\*, Sig 6\*, Loren or Megan 5\* ( same results but safer with loren i feel )

\- necro b7 for now

In my box I have lapis, anavel, sig, verde, bella, vero, megan, galleon, abigail, raoq, colleen, specta, hwa, baretta, bael, shannon, bernard, fuco, triana, mav, fran, loren, kro ( half done on double awake for now, working on it), lushen, xiao lin, sabrina x2, aegir,  chilling, khmun, luer, covenant, maruna, clara, zenobia, morris.

I find it hard to set my next goal now that I do gb10 db10 toa and working towards necro. I don't know what to 6\* next or what pve content i should target. I currently am farming as much as possible arena for stats buildings and devilmon, farm a lot of food and grind runes to try and better some of my monsters. I am trying to participate as much as I can in guild offense but i don't really have the mons, i'm just shooting for the 4\*rainbowmon lol.

I don't really know what potential do I have to go to the next step. Can someone give me a tip to keep building goals in PVE ? I'm waiting for Talia or Shaina to unlock twins potential in pve content, kinda stuck without at the moment. Thanks a lot in advance lads !"
