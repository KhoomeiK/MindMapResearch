AskReddit,fr05ox5,t3_gltezc,1589784525.0,"I think a lot of people have already answered this well, but I also want to add that there's the terrible reality of not having enough resources. One inner-city school I was at, the social worker just straight up quit, stretched too thin. And they couldn't replace her, I don't remember why but it was an issue of resources, and she'd quit in the beginning of the schoolyear. With no social worker, kids who were really struggling weren't getting help, so sadly they would sometimes lash out.

 Teachers are also stretched so thin, often at this school lots were clueless brand new teachers, the turnover rate was so high. Trying to do IEPs for several kids in one class, classroom management with large class sizes, prepare for standardized testing, plan meetings with parents who can't be bothered to show up, don't even have time to pee and you're eating your lunch while answering emails and adjusting lesson plans, if you get sick and need a substitute the kids don't react well to the change in routine and suddenly you're set back in lessons while also having to address the dozen behavior issues that came up, all while being a teacher fresh out of college or who has never taught in this kind of school situation. Or God forbid, is a longterm substitute who isn't even required to know the subject they're teaching because they're just a placeholder for the fact that the school had to lay off lots of teachers but can't afford to hire anyone back. I would love it if teachers could do all of this and still not only notice bullying (which, though sometimes obvious, can be subtle, especially when texting etc gets involved) but be able to address it effectively. If bullying was a situation that just needed one reprimand and be resolved, no problem. But it's not, and it gets complicated and often ties into home life that you can't do jack shit about, and honestly I think sometimes teachers want so badly to look out for students but what hope do they have when these kids need so much more support than a teacher can give them. A write up for something small is like ""controlling what you can when everything else is out of control"". It marginally helps maintain order, and it's something doable, instead of something that feels almost impossible. And sometimes it does come from a place of the teacher being overwhelmed and being more strict than they would've liked in retrospect. Teachers are human. Some teachers are even just trying to survive the schoolyear until they can resign in June, they're operating out of reaction every day and it's not helpful but they're just not up to the job and the school hired them because it was desperate. 

I really, really, feel for students who are bullied. Every teacher I've met wishes they could do more. I don't think anyone's out here like, ""hey, you know what would be fun, let's purposely let bullying get out of control!"", I think a lot of teachers are doing what they can (which is often behind the scenes, as others said) but sometimes, kids will fall between the cracks.

Everyone is excited to meet people they can relate to, some folks are hypersexual as a side effect of their situation, and a lot of teen admits are queer but are still put in same-sex rooms. Adolescent wards are honestly pretty fun--a lot of people have seen some serious shit, but they cope with humor, and the hospital is sometimes the only place you're able to escape the horrors of everyday life so you can really just joke around, and a lot of people are a little, young for their age? It can get silly. I follow a few people on Facebook from my time there (and it's so nice seeing how happy a lot of them are now-- one girl in particular, she'd been a rough case but now she's married with an adorable baby girl and she's so thankful to be alive). I still don't recommend, though, unless you really need to be kept safe, because I do have some serious trauma from things that went down (someone died for a few minutes, I had an abusive psychiatrist, some places just treat you like total shit, they think you're being a piece of shit or acting out on purpose anytime you have a flashback or symptom). 

Adult wards are much scarier. Teenagers are more likely to be able to recover in a few years, whereas some adults are pretty far gone, you're a lot more likely to see severe lifelong issues, people with criminal histories, people recovering from hard drug use. It's not scary in the sense of feeling threatened, I felt safe at these places (with one exception, but that was a psych ER so a bit different), it's scary because you're there hoping to God you recover because you can't face the thought of coming back here over and over like the older people who are there. But you have no way of knowing. It can really shock you to your senses, though, give you a reason to recover if your issue is not having enough reasons."

unpopularopinion,fqbpojx,t1_fqaxpmi,1589241513.0,"Socially, you're absolutely right, I wish to be treated like anyone else, not being judged on innate characteristics. 

Legislation (and any rules placed by companies or universities, whatever), however, has to be specific, or else it isn't effective. Like, there's laws about having a wheelchair accessible bathroom. It's a specific issue that's rectified by law; banning discrimination against people with disabilities isn't enough in that situation, there needs to be something in place to ensure their right to a bathroom.

 I can't speak for all transgender people, but I know one of the main problem I face is having access to gender neutral bathrooms. A law that required at least one gender neutral bathroom, the same way they require accessible stalls, would be a great way to give us the right to use the bathroom without fear of harrassment. That might not seem like a big deal for other people without the lived experience, but it is. It's really not great having to choose between holding your piss all day or dealing with people who get weirdly angry at you for using the bathroom (I'm androgynous, so both bathrooms cause problems). 

Trans rights aren't about special treatment (to me), it's about ensuring our safety, which I think everyone has a right to, and also equal opportunity (in some places, employers can discriminate against transgender employees and never be held accountable. I have not experienced this, but have heard accounts of it happening, and from what I understand there's not a whole lot in the law that addresses this, though I could be wrong, I'm not a lawyer. Personally, I never disclose my gender identity until after being hired, which is an awkward thing to have to do, but after being hired there's at least a chance HR could help with discrimination, which they can't do prior.) 

So, just treat us with respect like you would anyone else, and recognize that some rights we lack need to be rectified through specific legislation, and then you're all good :)"

But fat shaming has become a systemic problem, with fat people being discriminated against in healthcare (like being told to lose weight instead of considering a serious medical condition that fits the symptoms), and in employment and all that, so in that sense it's worse.

He's not being fake, and even though that's probably because he doesn't give enough shits about other people to prioritize making people comfortable, it's still something people can admire.

I can't believe they were like that because you said extra staff, a lot of the things people say are politically incorrect are kind of a reach to me. 

But yeah like something I experienced along these lines was, I went to a transgender support group and that took a lot of vulnerability on my part, I have a lot of social anxiety and I didn't know anyone. I opened up about something to them, in short monologue style, and when I was done talking the first thing they said was ""ouch, we don't use the word 'guys' here because it's hurtful"" or something and I was expected to apologize and it was just like...I understand, but also, did you hear anything I opened up to you about or did you only wish to cherry pick the single word that you found offensive? How are we supposed to connect to each other if we have to be hypervigilant about using the right words, or else we go completely unheard if we use the wrong one?"
unpopularopinion,fqaqg4d,t3_ghaico,1589223503.0,"Agreed. It kind of goes two ways: sometimes people will have insightful, well thought-out viewpoints but use the ""wrong"" words, so everyone demonizes them and doesn't listen, and sometimes people will have hurtful viewpoints but use the ""right"" words and somehow that's more acceptable. The critical evaluation of opinions isn't there, people listen to the language people use and go off of that.

Image and reputation are just so important in our society that we forget the importance of actually living the values we preach. Without the values, you can put on a mask of political correctness, and everyone will praise you whether you've done the hard work of empathizing and understanding who you pretend to advocate for or not.

And like a lot of people here, I also feel alienated from the queer community because of people only seeing language instead of intentions. And all the black and white thinking. But if we question it, we get cancelled, or called out, or whatever. It's very...high school. It just makes me really sad, honestly. Online is the worst, it's not nearly as bad in person, but it makes me sad that people who aren't fortunate enough to have queer family in person are only exposed to the totally backwards online version.

Also like, the PC movement really waters down what we are actually fighting for. I think part of it is that the most privileged voices rise to the top, and to them, saying ""hey guys"" or ""transgendered"" does feel transphobic because that is the extent of their experience. People forget, I think, that so many of us just want a sense of unity and respect. The words are always going to be changing, but I can tell when someone respects and values me, and that will always matter more to me than the words they use."

-redirect your attention to your physical environment (ex. Count how many blue things you can see) or your breathing
-get out of your head and into your body: jump up and down, move around, whatever
-tell the thoughts to fuck off (yes, a therapist told me this)
-be curious about why you're having the thought: what is the feeling associated with it? Shame, fear? What are the urges? Where does it come from? What underlying assumptions about yourself are in this thought? Is there something making you vulnerable to this thought right now (maybe you're tired, triggered by a memory, whatever)?

There are some LGBTQ+ friendly support groups listed here! Also, if you need a personal therapist, PsychologyToday has a filter for LGBTQ+ friendly therapists. I know that isn't always the same as trans friendly, but it seems slightly more likely they will be.

Also I want you to know you're not alone, I'm also trans (nonbinary) and my dysphoria certainly factors into my ED, as well. And the isolation that can sometimes come with being transgender. From what I understand, there's not a whole lot of research about trans identities and eating disorders, but the research I have seen consistently shows we are more likely to have EDs or ED behaviors than cisgender folks. And just in my experience, a lot of the trans folks I know have/had an ED or ED behaviors. 

So it's possible you might find some support by finding a transgender support group (wouldn't be a medical resource, but people might be able to give ideas on lessening dysphoria without ED behaviors).

ADHD,fp4o949,t3_gb7wpm,1588303425.0,"Yeah. I think my ADD is where a lot of my insecurity comes from. Mostly personality stuff, though. I feel self conscious about being weird or annoying or self centered because I get really enthusiastic around other people and I love telling crazy stories and I have a hard time controlling how talkative I can get. And I'm just very bouncy and I can come off as childish I guess. 

I'm still working on self acceptance in therapy. It's really hard, to be honest. I've used a lot of unhealthy behaviors in the past to try to be more perfect or run away from my insecurities and I'm still unlearning those. My therapist said I need to work on being mindful of my emotions without attaching to them and judging them so much. And I guess like, accept that 1) there's no one right way to be human 2) trying to fit a mold isn't gonna work 3) if I can accept myself and be myself, that's ultimately going to be the path to happiness instead of trying to be something I'm not. I'm always going to have ADHD. But that absolutely does not mean I can't be happy and love my weirdness and exuberance. And I can achieve that without other people deciding I'm good enough for happiness and self-love."

I'm not going to lie, one of my biggest regrets about highschool is that I didn't ditch more and do stupid shit with my friends. I feel guilty advising people to do that, and don't do drugs or anything too bad, but being a teenager should be a time where people can fuck up and still have their lives ahead of them. People learn way more from fucking up than from taking tests. And life experience is more valuable than grades. 
 
But there's that feeling that if you don't perform well 100% of the time, you're a failure or a disappointment and it's bullshit, honestly. And the whole ""straight to 4 year university"" thing is bullshit, too. Probably the most successful person I know dropped out of highschool junior year. I wish you luck in school. Don't believe anyone who says highschool is the best years of your life, most of us would never dare to go back. It gets better when you can make your own choices."

unpopularopinion,fp2ywt8,t1_fp1v4hn,1588270220.0,"I guess that makes sense, then. I was obese at one point and even though there wasn't anything I could do about it (it was a medication side effect), it made it hard to do some of the things I love, like gymnastics. So if I could have pursued weight loss, I probably would have (now I am off the med and a ""healthy"" BMI). I think my problem with people seeing weight loss as self improvement is when they think weight loss will make them love their body,
 or make them more attractive. The only thing that will make someone love their body imo is learning to love their body as it is. And people can be attractive at any weight. It's the illusion of ""if I go on this restrictive diet I hate, and do workouts with the sole purpose of burning calories, my life will improve"" that I think people suffer from, which is just bad logic. And in that case I would discourage them from doing it. I don't know how weight loss works at that high of a BMI, though. I guess I would just want people I care about to lose weight in a healthy way (including mental attitude) if I were to consider encouraging them.

Edit: also, in my experience, the majority of people I've met pursuing weight loss are not doing it for health, which is sad to me and another reason I'm hesitant to encourage anyone"

unpopularopinion,fp1g5w4,t3_gaiqec,1588234407.0,"I have mixed feelings about this. Personally, I don't think encouraging people to lose weight is a good idea. I'd be glad to tell a friend ""yeah, go you!"" if they told me they're committing to treating their body nicely, or working out in a way they enjoy, or including healthier foods in their diet. 

But ""losing weight"", for a lot of people, isn't any of those things. Have you heard how people talk about their diets? ""Ugh, I wish I could have that cake, but I'm on a diet"". ""I hate my thighs, can't wait for this cleanse to kick in"", those kinds of things. This isn't self-improvement. It's self-flagellation for being something society perceives to be wrong: fat. 

Losing weight just, isn't a great goal. And the majority of the ways people pursue it don't work, and they gain the weight back. I'd love to encourage people to seek self-improvement. I just don't think moving from fat (a fine thing) to less fat (also a fine thing) is improvement. The idea that it is is rooted in the assumption that being fat is inherently a bad thing, and it isn't. Being fat does not indicate health. I was healthier at my fattest than at my thinnest. So I agree that people have a right to improve themselves. I just think the premise of weight loss as improvement is false."

The problem comes with viewing that as a bad thing. I'm guilty of it, too, feeling so scared of gaining weight.

EatingDisorders,forkzp3,t3_g8xug0,1588013997.0,"I'm so glad you're getting the help you need and working on this! You deserve a life that is fun and doesn't feel like a chore. I know what it's like for life to revolve entirely around bingeing and it's so draining.

Since you said that when you do notice feelings, your feelings are negative and extreme, my guess is you're kinda like me and if feelings are on an intensity scale of 1-10, you don't even notice they're there until an 8, 9, even 10. But they are there wayyyy before that and the way to start noticing them earlier is mindfulness. Mindfulness is something you need to practice, not just something you use when you're about to hit crisis. Could you set aside some time every morning, midday, and night to check in with yourself? Just sitting quietly, no distractions, and really ask yourself: what am I feeling? What am I thinking? What are my body's sensations?

I've also found the app RiseUp very helpful this because when you write down what you ate (its not like mfp or anything, doesn't log calories, it's up to you how detailed you log) it gives you a list of emotions and ED behaviors to check off and a space to journal. I find it helps me be aware of what I am feeling before and after I eat and noticing the urges I have. And the emotion list is nice because it's easier to know what you're feeling if you look at a list.

Edit: it's also nice because sometimes when I write down the urges, they're no longer stuck in my head and they have less power. I think sometimes the feelings just need to get out, and my brain doesn't seem to care much if they get out on paper or in action, as long as they're out.

Anyway, I think in general what you're needing is some mindfulness practice. It's a practice, by the way, it's really hard to get good at. It sounds like you have a lot of awareness about your past, but mindfulness will bring you awareness about your present. Try googling ""mindfulness dbt"" or ""mindfulness cbt"" to find specifics about it."
fuckeatingdisorders,fopg3t4,t1_fop6ygb,1587960594.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words and taking the time to respond to this! It was especially helpful to hear that if you do binge, it's understandable and doesn't erase your progress. I think I forget a lot that my progress doesn't depend on being binge free 100% of the time, that I can try again and keep going. I ended up not exactly bingeing today, but I did end up overeating because it took a while to get the energy to eat and by then I was really hungry. So I really like your mindset that we're only so human :) and now I'm in some comfy baggy clothes and I think I will make some tea. Thank you again, so much, you're really kind :)"
fuckeatingdisorders,fopf7fg,t1_fopbccn,1587959951.0,"Glad I could help! And yeah I mean honestly, getting nutrition from Ensures and vitamins is a good place to start, it's important to be nourished and it doesn't mean that's going to be your diet forever. Especially if you're used to being malnourished, you'll also notice it make it a lot easier mentally to work on this kind of stuff. I didn't even realize how much my really limited food intake was affecting my mind until I started getting better nutrition. It's kind of a cool little cycle where getting the nutrition makes it easier mentally to do hard things like trying new foods, and then that helps your nutrition and it builds from there"
fuckeatingdisorders,fop6wrg,t1_fooyqcs,1587954427.0,"You're right, and I hope OP finds both your input and my experience helpful. I share my experience because I don't think the fine line between the normal overeating phase and relapse into binge eating is talked about enough. There's a difference between eating food for reasons other than sustenance and eating as an unhealthy way to cope, similar to leaning on friends when needed vs treating them like a therapist, or having a drink after a long day vs drinking to numb your feelings. I think it's great that OP is trying to find out which side they fall on, and people giving the rote response of ""it's normal"" is why it took me so long to figure out I had relapsed. I'm offering my perspective so OP has the chance to figure it out. Thanks for making sure people know more about IE, it's important that everyone is informed as possible when they choose to try it."
fuckeatingdisorders,fooxozi,t3_g7z0u4,1587948669.0,"This was where I was at 10 days ago! I highly recommend creating a plan for how you're going to avoid binging--deciding not to binge isn't enough. I've made that same decision a million times in the past, only for it not to work because I didn't have enough strategies. Do you have some kind of support to help you into recovery, like a therapist or dietician?"
fuckeatingdisorders,foox26e,t3_g7k5bs,1587948280.0,"Maybe r/SPD? (Sensory Processing Disorder). Not being able to eat certain foods because of texture sounds like a sensory processing issue (or maybe ARFID, like the other comment said, look into that too). I'm not bothered by texture, mostly smell, but sensory issues can really mess with your eating. Someone posted a pdf on there a while ago that had information about how people treat the issue, it sounds like it's mostly making sure you're getting the nutrition you need, identifying specific textures/smells/tastes/colors/etc that are difficult, and working very very slowly toward eating the food. I'm talking like, getting comfortable looking at it, then getting comfortable smelling it, then touching it to your lips, then your tongue, then eventually taking a single bite kind of slowly, taking the time you need.

Also, can you drink shakes? Something like ensure or soylent could be really good. Soylent can completely replace meals, and they make one with a neutral flavor profile, so I basically lived off of it at one point while I worked on my food issues (like you, I was only eating a very small number of foods, and I had a hard time getting enough nutrition)."
ADHD,fookvcg,t3_g8ab5b,1587940991.0,"I relate to feeling weird and disliked and annoying and Too Much. Here's some things, though. 1) Being enthusiastic, even if it's 300% enthusiastic, is not inherently a bad thing. 2) You are an enthusiastic, exuberant person, whether people like it or not, and trying to stuff yourself down to be more likeable is painful and I don't recommend it 3) That being said, there's another option: channeling the enthusiasm. Personally, my brain feels full a lot and I need to do something with it, and then the excitement turns into me ranting about the thing and then people get overwhelmed. But now I do a lot of writing, and I come up with songs, and art, and I write down all of my ambitious ideas about the world, and these can turn into super cool things where other people are like, ""whoa, how did you even think of that? I wish I had a mind like yours!"" So, like, you can still be 100% yourself and not overwhelm people! And even impress them! There's a reason ADHDers are known for being creative and bold and way more likely to create their own business. We've got a lot of cool stuff in our heads, we just need to figure out what to do with it 4) I highly recommend making some friends that enjoy the enthusiasm and the weirdness! My friends love my weird doodles and fun facts and info dumping. They even love that sometimes I just really need to sprint or skip instead of walk. We even bounce our crazy ideas off of each other. 

Just because some people think you're too much doesn't mean everyone will. And just because some people think you're too much doesn't mean you *are* too much. Keeping that in mind will help when people find it difficult to keep up--it's normal to feel hurt when they shut you down, but remembering that these qualities you have aren't bad, they're just stuck in a wrong situation, helps not to think of it as a personal flaw or something to be ashamed of. You don't need to be anyone but you. 

(Obviously, in the situation you talked about, your partner setting a boundary and you respecting it was actually a really good thing, I'm just saying that your partner setting a boundary doesn't mean who you are as person is too much, you are amazing and unique and I hope you find a way to channel it into something cool! You could always make a youtube channel or a podcast to talk about your hyperfixations, that would be super cool.)
