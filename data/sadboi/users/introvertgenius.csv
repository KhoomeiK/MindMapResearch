I am running a party of Olberic (74), Cyrus (74), Ophilia (74), and Therion (68). I don't have any of the secret jobs yet.

Can anyone give me any tips of what I should do first before attempting Winnehild again? Should I go and do all the other secret jobs first?

Thank you in advance."

Torchlight,fp5c38r,t3_gbejkq,1588323787.0,"You are correct in your thinking, the mine is where the game takes place and what you will be exploring. You should be coming across story missions that you got from town that you will encounter as you keep getting deeper into the mine. It has been a little while since I played, so I don't remember the levels that you will encounter story parts.   


As you go deeper into the mine the mobs will get more difficult. Not knowing what level you are on it is difficult to determine how much difficulty the game should be throwing at you. It is a pretty natural progression game, so if you are clearing out the levels, your level will stay around the level of the mobs that you are encountering.   


Depending on the class that you chose it can be fairly easy, but as you get deeper into the mine you should start to encounter some rare mobs that are more difficult. Also the equipment you get can make things much easier for you if you are getting lucky with the gear that you get."

schizophrenia,fny303o,t3_g4k87i,1587352163.0,"I have been questioning my diagnosis for 10 years. I will have good periods where I will question, 'hey, maybe I am normal'. That will go on for a little bit, but, then something will happen and I will have an episode or periods of episodes. I think a lot of it though is the perception of what is normal. For me, I am alone most of the time. I don't interact with anyone besides my family, so I start to think that things are normal. Then I will try to do something normal like go to the grocery store, and I will be triggered and have an episode.   


When I go in for my evaluations I always think they are going well. The questions seem normal, and how I respond to things seem normal, and it all just seems normal, but when my eval comes back, it says the complete opposite of how I feel it went.   


I think a lot of it is how we perceive us. Since we are use to how we act we don't see what we are doing as abnormal, but when being evaluated and talking about our days to doctors, they see the things that we don't see. I always hope that I will be given the clear to work or something, but, all the doctors for me say the same things. I have to force myself to trust my doctors sometimes. My mother really helps me with that.   


Sure, things may seem normal while I am sitting in my room playing video games, or programming, but the truth is, there are things that aren't normal. The voices especially. I ignore them most of the time when I can, or drown them out with music or video game sounds, so I don't always hear them, but when I take off my headphones, they are there.   


It all makes complete sense what you are saying, and I think in these cases it is best to trust the doctors, and know that are meds are the reasons why we have periods of normalcy."

schizophrenia,flq5ged,t3_fqdo5g,1585379875.0,"Living on your own is difficult. I am not sure where I fall in the amount that I receive, but I get about $1,200 a month after insurance is taken out. Where I live now, apartments/condos go for about $900 a month, but they are difficult to get unless you have someone that is going to sign with you, since the renter will see that you aren't working, and that you are only receiving the amount that you are receiving. $900, plus utilities, plus food, left me with very little left over. I never looked into income based housing or discounted housing for disabled people though.   


I have had to move back in with family, who I pay each month and pay for the food. It is a little more comfortable, but the idea of me living on my own again have pretty much gone out the window since I remember how difficult it was for me to live on my own in the first place.   


You are able to earn an amount of money while you are on SS, but I think that is dependent on how much you are receiving. For me, I could earn up to $811 a month without impacting my benefits, but the problem is, I can't work a job. Every job I have tried to get over the years I have been told that I wasn't a good fit due to my mental issues pretty much. Which is understandable. I wouldn't be reliable at times. Right now I am living in a reality that I am having about an episode a day, so I wouldn't be able to work while I am sorting that out in my head.   


It is very doable if you find the right place and the right circumstances, and are careful with your money. My situation and experience isn't the only way things can happen. There are a lot of services out there. There is housing for disabled people. There are a lot of resources out there, and I think NAMI has a bunch of the resources on their website.   


Good luck with everything."

I think at the end of the day it was really just how it was marketed, and when MySpace started to incorporate things like games with the platform it started to even attract more people that wanted to play those games like Mobsters or other games like that. Xanga was a good platform, it just failed with word of mouth, and really seems to lose all types of traction when things like WordPress came around. It is a shame though. It was a good platform."

schizophrenia,fj8vrda,t3_fc6myu,1583123575.0,"There is no one medication out there that will do the same thing for everyone, that is why there are so many medications out there. The chemicals and electrical impulses in our heads are all different. There isn't a medication and dosage that is going to do the same for everyone that takes it. That is why it takes a lot of trial and error finding the medications that work with each individual for the time. That can change too over time as your body builds up a tolerance to the medication or as the chemicals in your head change, which is why they need to change medications on occasion.

I got tired of being labeled the 'weird' guy because I sometimes don't really think before I speak. I got tired of being the reason that people would stop going to certain places. I don't think I'm a bad person. I just like to talk about weird things. Not like conspiracy theory type things, but things that are actually happening in the world. Okay, maybe a few conspiracy theory things, because I do believe in aliens.   


I would never go out when I was delusional or anything like that, because I know that can lead to things and conversations that I know aren't coherent. I am fairly aware when I am headed toward that. So is my family. They have urged me not to go out some nights in the past.   


I just stay at my computer. Post my weird stuff to Twitter. Sometimes just trying to be silly and funny. I know my place though. This place is best for me and best for everyone else. It gets lonely, but I'm getting use to it. I have a lot of video games to play and a few people that I chat with online. This is where the 'normal' world wants me.

introvert,fj6593l,t3_fbq6ue,1583057360.0,"I would say that if she keeps trying to engage in conversation with you, especially about personal topics, it would be considered harassment, especially if you have asked her not to do it. Especially if it is making you feel uncomfortable.   


I would say in this situation you would want to beyond your supervisor and speak to HR about this. That would be the proper thing to do, and would prevent your supervisor from retaliating against you. Explain to them that you have no problem discussing work related things with this woman, but you do not want to share or talk about your personal life with people at work, which is very acceptable. I've had jobs where my co-workers would constantly try to find out things about me in my personal life, and they make fun of me because I didn't want to share anything from my personal life with my co-workers. I didn't add them on social media, or anything like that.

Twitch,fj64yid,t3_fbr1ql,1583056943.0,"Music, besides the game music, can be a deciding factor for me. If it is music I don't normally listen to or don't enjoy it will most likely push me away from the stream. If it is also overpowering or too loud, it will also push me away.   


Something like a just chatting or chilling stream some music is nice, but again, depending on the music, it can be a turn off.   


I think background music can be good, if the music from the game isn't good or if there isn't any. But if you are listening to something like rap or country it may be a turn off to some people. But I am saying that from a bit of biased opinion. There are people that may prefer that.   


When I use to stream and would play music I would stick to non-vocal music from Pretzel ( [https://www.pretzel.rocks/](https://www.pretzel.rocks/)) or play some medieval sounding music for when I played World Of Warcraft. I made sure it was about the same level as the game sounds if not a little lower. I didn't want it to be a focal point, but I just liked to have some music playing sometimes.   


Good luck with finding your balance."

schizophrenia,fimep8p,t3_f8ku57,1582527315.0,"I missed my best friend's wedding. Her and I have a history of dating, so I know her family very well, as a bit of a back story.   


It was a destination wedding down at a resort in Mexico. I don't recall which one.   


This posed many problems for me. Financially it would have been a little bit much for me, but I could have managed. The flying and being alone though would have been my major issues. What if I had an episode while I was down there? I would have had no one with me that would have been able to help me at all. What if I had an episode on the plane? I don't like flying to begin with, so the excess stress from that could have triggered me. I don't take any sedatives.   


She is, or was, my best friend. She knows I'm schizoaffective. She knows I have issues. She has seen them. She saw them the last two years that we were dating. She understood my concerns. She has never expressed any anger or resentment to me about it, which I don't think a friend would. I think a friend would understand.   


I think that is the important thing. A friend will understand your concerns. How to deal with the guilt. Well, for me, the fact that she hasn't seemed bitter about it or anything has helped me. I thought that she would be upset about it. Even though part of me still believes she chose the destination wedding to make sure I wasn't there. That is just my own paranoia though.   


I think guilt and anxiety is just part of schizophrenia. I don't think that it can be avoided, but you have to realize that you are making these decisions for you and your mental health. No one is going to know you better than you. Family and friends will understand and be supportive. I made it up to her by getting her and her husband a nice gift.   


You have to come first in all your decisions. Pushing yourself beyond your limits is what is going to trigger an episode, and the last place I think any of us want to have an episode is around a crowd of people that might not even notice to help us."

I had different groups of friends and would go into NYC a lot since I lived so close, which is where a lot of these friends were. I didn't keep in touch with them, and as I said, the ones I have tried to find have turned up empty.   


You are probably very right. There is no right answer. If they tell me something didn't happen, then how would my mind react to that really? Would it cause more problems? Right now it is just wondering, if I confirm that some of these memories are delusions, then where does that leave me?

As I said, for all I know in some situations I was sitting alone in my car driving around, or sitting on benches in NYC talking to no one. I just don't know, and for the most part, I can't figure them out.   


I guess there is no real harm in keeping them as memories since some of them did bring me a lot joy and happiness.   


I have been having difficulty with giving up on solitary life. I have developed agoraphobia and really have trouble going out for any period of time over an hour or so, and I can only go to places I know. There are times I have to go to some place new, and in those cases I will bring a family member until I get comfortable with it.   


I know that dwelling on the past isn't helping me at all. I try very hard to live in the present, but there isn't much about my present to live in. I work on computer programming, play video games, and chat with people online mostly.

reddeadmysteries,fho39it,t1_fhnm4mx,1581740043.0,"I had the same thoughts about Gavin's Friend/Nigel. I thought that maybe he is suffering from schizophrenia, but I watched a video and if you hogtie Nigel he is carrying a letter that talks about both Nigel and Gavin. The letter is to Nigel, and the letter mentions Gavin. That is the only thing that removed those thoughts that Gavin doesn't exist.   


My opinion on this has led toward Gavin actually leaving the area and going back to England. Nigel seems to be a little obsessive, indicated by the fact that has been searching for Gavin for over 7 years. I am sure it started innocently him just searching for his friend, but it does seem that he has drifted into obsessive compulsion. The amount of distance he has wandered looking for him over the years.

That was 10 years ago, and I am doing better now that I am receiving treatment for my mental health. It is all like a bad dream for me, and even at the time, it felt like a dream state."

schizophrenia,fhh0lgp,t1_fhgxqlm,1581588059.0,"I honestly feel that everyone is out to get me, even the few people I talk to online. I feel they talk about me when I am not around or in private chats. I know some of them have private chats going on in Discord. Not that there is a problem with that, but I feel they talk about me. I don't know why they keep me around, to be honest. I am weird with everything I say most of the time. They ask me questions sometimes randomly, that don't make sense. Sometimes they know something I did when I didn't say that I did it. They say it is because I said I was going to do it a few days ago, which... is true, but how do they remember I said those things. 

I am getting in my head with thinking about it, which I do a lot. I try to curb my thoughts when I start to think things like that. Been thinking about it a bunch tonight. Not sure why. I am sure there is a reason. There is always a logical reason, as my former therapist said. There is always a reason. Even she knew things about me that I know I didn't talk to her about... At least, I don't think I did."
schizophrenia,fhgn02f,t3_f33rdr,1581571827.0,"I do share these feelings. Every time someone new sends me a message online or interacts with me or something, I feel they know something about me, that they shouldn't.   


It happened a few weeks ago. There was a person I was talking to online, and I started to feel that they were just knowing things about me that they shouldn't know, that I didn't tell them. They started to ask questions about a couple of my friends, and I never mentioned these people by name. They started to ask me some weird questions, and I felt they were really just trying to set me up for something. It just felt wrong. I started to dread seeing a message from this person. I started to freak out when I would see them online. I pretty much just sent them a message, saying I'm sorry, and blocked them on all social media.   


Looking back at it, it was very much my mind playing tricks on me, as it does when someone new shows up. I always think they are trying to get something from me. Money. Information. Or what ever little I still have left in my life. I feel they are spying on me and feeding information to someone else. I only chat with like 4 people online, and it took me a long time to trust them.   


I wish I had more helpful advice to give you. If this helps, it is just your mind playing with you. The disease. I know it is difficult to see that in the moment though. It is good to talk to your therapist about it. For me, it seems to really get triggered if things move quickly and not on my terms. That is what happened with that one situation for me. They would message me like 5 times a day, sending memes and stuff like that. I felt crowded."
schizophrenia,fhgkrg7,t3_f2x7bm,1581569884.0,"I was too afraid to tell anyone when I was 15. I was scared they would send me away or something. I started to self medicated to hide it. It took 20 years, many failed and broken relationships, and a lot of self medicating to finally confess all of it. It is unfortunate it took me a suicide attempt and time in jail to convince me to confess it all.   


Please talk to someone. Talk to a doctor. Talk to your parents. The treatment is much better now. There is nothing to hide or be ashamed of. There is still life with schizophrenia if that is what it is. It is different than other lives, but it can still be a wonderful and fulfilling life with the right treatment. It is my biggest regret that I didn't talk to someone when I was younger about it."

I use to be a person that use to be in a position that I was able to give people money as tips/gifts or whatever you want to call it. I won't say I got into the tens of thousands of dollars of giving, but, it was a substantial amount of money for me. I had something happen in my life also that I could have really used that money back, but I never would have thought to turn to them to ask for the money back.   


He was gifting you money. It isn't your responsibility or problem that he got into financial difficulties due to whatever is going on in his life. It is just like any gift in my opinion. Whether it is findom, sugar daddy, or any other type of situation like that. He put himself into that position, and that is on him, that isn't on you.   


I can't put the blame on you for this. You didn't seek him out to prey on him to take this money from him or put him into this position. He put himself into this position. He was probably doing very well financially, and something went wrong. Either his business really did fail, or his family found out about all of this and they are putting pressure on him to get the money back because it was money that he shouldn't have been spending.

I don't understand the universe much. It intrigued me when I was in school, but my brain blew up when I started to learn facts and unknowns.   


I don't know if something is out there that are the same as the dinosaurs that we had roaming our planet, but, maybe something similar, unless you believe in the ancient aliens possibility and that aliens could have brought dinosaurs to our planet from another planet.   


Things like this are what get me excited. Talking about this stuff. It is all speculation with me though, as I don't have the education or knowledge to really make an educated determination if something like this is possible, but, I believe it is.

I don't have child porn or anything illegal on the drive. It is just very sensitive data in some cases.

If something like that was to ever be leaked, I would be in a lot of legal trouble. 

Yes, I am being paranoid. That is in my nature. I know data recovery companies have a code of ethics to uphold and that states that they can't leak the data they recover. 

I am just a little torn on it, because there are some memory photos and videos from many years ago, from a period in my life that brought me joy. I don't know if revisiting those memories are even good for me. I know they are on that drive. There are also of course some pretty personal pictures and memories on there.

As someone said, someone with psychopathic tendencies would have felt nothing, but even then, it is just a game. A story. Look at the number of people that we kill in video games and don't feel much about it. They are just 0s and 1s on a screen.
