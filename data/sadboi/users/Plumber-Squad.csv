depression,etyabbs,t3_c2fuf3,1563315398.0,"My parents inflict depression unto me. I canâ€™t do anything like call the cops because itâ€™s not that bad, but we have a trust relationship that keeps being formed and broken again and itâ€™s real sad.  My mom sometimes tries to hug me and Iâ€™ll say no, Iâ€™m in a really bad spot with her right then.  I am forced to and at the moment I hate her.  I want her to die. And weeks after forcing hugs,  and going out for ice cream, something horrible happens between us and I feel so devastated.   I want to avoid her but canâ€™t.  The cycle is forced to go in a loop because of her.  Iâ€™m never stable.  I want to have a good time with life but canâ€™t.  I need to wait until I can go to college or move out."
