intermittentfasting,fa062bf,t1_f9v1yrs,1575749512.0,"Just curious, did you have any issues prior to starting IF?  I am almost to the point of eating breakfast.  I was doing 16:8 and basically skipping breakfast and not eating after dinner.  I may begin to eat breakfast again ( keto, of course) and see if that resolves the issue.  Maybe starting IF and keto together was too much of a shock to my system.
I just keep thinking though that one day  my system will adjust."
keto,f9vqmq6,t1_f9vpw5m,1575677134.0,"Thank you, I will give that a shot."
keto,f9vpmo9,t1_f9vn8t9,1575676392.0,"So it seems like almost anything...salads, steak, eggs, avocados...it doesn't really seem to matter what I eat...just that I am eating!"
intermittentfasting,f9vnaes,t1_f9vm7ke,1575674682.0,"Thank you for the advice.  I certainly have been trying to get more fiber, I think this will help!"
intermittentfasting,f9v3txr,t1_f9v0b87,1575662648.0,It certainly is a challenge to narrow down these GI issues....and what if it is multiple things!
keto,f9v3pnl,t1_f9v0dvs,1575662589.0,"Ok, understand that.  I am going to keep track with a food journal and see if I can't figure out what food it may be..."
intermittentfasting,f9v3h94,t1_f9v1yrs,1575662476.0,I think I am going to try that and see what happens!
intermittentfasting,f9uzxqf,t1_f9uvr2k,1575660692.0,Thanks.  I was thinking about adding some chia seeds prior to breaking the fast to see if indeed that would help.
keto,f9uzlqb,t1_f9uzd2p,1575660528.0,Thanks.  I may try adding some fiber like chia seed prior to breaking the fast.  I have read that will sometimes help prevent issues when breaking the fast.
intermittentfasting,f9uzfmy,t1_f9uwdnl,1575660445.0,"So, initially I was with about 400 mg of magnesium glycinate, since I had read that was the least likely to cause GI issues.  I have been off that for a week now.  Thanks for your reply!"
keto,f7wtf4j,t3_dxuoo8,1574037613.0,I have found I can satisfy my cravings by just getting the broth and adding the condiments to the broth...no noodles!
keto,f6ds02m,t3_dqufow,1572796615.0,Great job!  You help inspire me!
hempflowers,ezb4lz7,t3_d0n942,1567812985.0,Looks yummy!  Enjoy!
weed,ez7ra3z,t3_c3qrxc,1567727356.0,Mine is on the way.....
weather,ez0y55c,t3_czt6x4,1567643535.0,I have never even heard of a CAT 5
MMJ,eywphy5,t1_eywlvhg,1567534899.0,I think this is a pretty common experience.  I certainly have benefited from CBD.  I am not totally on board with THC...I am still pretty new to that and I am looking for a medication that does not get me stoned!
MMJ,eywg87e,t3_cz6j0f,1567528773.0,"I was approved for the same diagnosis....very easy process and nothing to even think twice about.

As an aside, I am not sure I have ever heard anyone say that they were not approved!

Good luck and I hope you find relief!"
PaMedicalMarijuana,eyl0yrs,t3_cxg8tk,1567173508.0,So my experience was pretty easy.  I did not have to make an appointment for my first visit and at my first visit I could have declined the pharmacist consult.  I am sure this varied from dispensary to dispensary.
PaMedicalMarijuana,eyj29v7,t3_cx5ze0,1567111303.0,"So, just my 2 cents.
If you have not had a PCP for awhile, it would be good to make an appointment with your new PCP.  If that PCP is a certifying physician that is even better...it shows that provider is open to MMJ.
Bring up your anxiety to your new PCP.  Anxiety can be a complex disorder and having a good diagnosis will definitely benefit you.  Discuss with your provider your idea of trying MMJ and see what they think.
Insurance will not pay for the certificate or the medicine unfortunately.
I hope you find help with your anxiety."
CBD,ey31tf0,t3_cmefmt,1566753312.0, Nice!  How do you like it?
PaMedicalMarijuana,ex3rkl9,t1_ex155fh,1565990185.0,Nice!
PaMedicalMarijuana,ex0k659,t1_ex0j36b,1565915084.0,Thanks!
PaMedicalMarijuana,ewz04nz,t1_ewywmqz,1565889361.0,They certainly can help you.  All you really need to do is go and tell the doctor exactly what you just stated.  They will create a medical record for you.  Hope you find the help you are looking for!
PaMedicalMarijuana,ewoomjn,t1_ewoo4tw,1565623124.0,I went to King of Prussia.  It was a very easy process.  Good luck!  Let me know if I can answer any questions.
PaMedicalMarijuana,ewonh1c,t1_ewon50a,1565622339.0,I used them for the diagnosis of anxiety and did not have medical records.  The process was very easy.
PaMedicalMarijuana,ewom7dm,t3_cpd9vi,1565621473.0,Not sure where you are located but Veriheal can definitely help you out!
medicalmarijuana,ewipe3i,t3_coj9v2,1565454094.0,I also had him and I agree...super nice and he will put you at ease...Veriheal was a great experience all around.
PaMedicalMarijuana,ewg2ttf,t1_ewfpgb6,1565372658.0,I will add that one to my list of things to try...thanks for the tip!!
PaMedicalMarijuana,eweb7ce,t1_eweaj9q,1565319104.0,My first hit I did take a bit more than I wanted to...they had recommended only a one second hit followed by a couple more seconds of fresh air.
PaMedicalMarijuana,ew9fxw6,t1_ew9fgyj,1565224683.0,Thank you so much!!  A lot of good information!
PaMedicalMarijuana,ew9a50m,t3_cnd92e,1565222045.0,I am in the same boat.  Waiting for my card to come.  Anxiety is my condition.  Total newbie!
PaMedicalMarijuana,evz8m01,t3_clxncc,1564951597.0,So how did you like it?
PaMedicalMarijuana,evfa2zc,t1_eveghjj,1564491974.0,Yes on North Sixth Street...the old Camp Curtain Fire Station.
PaMedicalMarijuana,evdhd74,t1_evbjnmb,1564438272.0,Great idea to keep it in a separate area from your DL!
PaMedicalMarijuana,evdha17,t3_cjh74q,1564438213.0,"Just be honest with the CC doctor.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of providers that still do not suscribe to MMJ."
CBD,eubw99t,t3_cfqhua,1563658611.0,I have had great success with Lazarus Naturals high potency!
Anxiety,eu4kvrz,t3_ced3nz,1563456833.0,Congrats!!!
PaMedicalMarijuana,etj1r9a,t3_cbxmck,1562864485.0,Great news!!
CBD,etghnti,t3_cbkrf6,1562791198.0,We have a ways to go!
Anxiety,etf34o7,t3_cbbbqw,1562758416.0,"Sorry you were treated like this.... although, this does not surprise me.  Irregardless of what the purpose of that hotline is, a little empathy and compassion is not a hard thing to give!"
PaMedicalMarijuana,etank8s,t1_et9eydx,1562624449.0,Cool!
CBD,etak071,t3_captf0,1562622031.0,I just got the gelato#33 today from Tweedle Farms....never vaped before...going to give it a try!!
wicked_edge,et64545,t3_ca6axk,1562503246.0,If the price is right!
CBD,et2exbf,t3_c9rvjs,1562415786.0,"I think this is the issue that a lot of people have right now.  I think the only way to be 100% sure you will pass a test is to not take any CBD product.  It certainly seems to still be the wild west when it comes to CBD and there really is very little regulation or real certification.

Maybe stick with some of the older vendors in this arena and hope that when they sell you something that says 0% THC, it is indeed that!"
cbdinfo,esyiird,t1_esyhn8m,1562343986.0,Exactly!
CBD,esxarck,t3_c9dms7,1562327873.0,"It seems like they are a wide variety of answers to this question.  
If you are using such a low % of THC it sucks that it can show up in a piss test when clearly it is not having a psychoactive effect!"
Marijuana,esx9tbx,t3_c9e9jp,1562327504.0,"Yes, there is a risk.  You will probably burn the joint down. ðŸ˜‚"
wicked_edge,esx98zp,t3_c9eb8v,1562327267.0,I seem to be able to go about 8 hours before I start to notice it growing back... everyone is different though!
PaMedicalMarijuana,estxofn,t1_estxakl,1562274844.0,I think it would pay to try a couple.  They all have different strains and different products.  It seems like they are quick to seek out because the demand is so great. Hopefully you will find something that works!!
PaMedicalMarijuana,estw6zk,t1_estmvmv,1562274274.0,"Rise was good....I certainly have heard of the one in Hanover but have not heard any real reviews.
Rise did give a discount on the first purchase and has an awards program with text messages regarding sales and strains!"
socialanxiety,estozar,t3_c94o87,1562270974.0,It is shame....this just adds to the stigma that people feel that have this disorder.  I feel like any mental health disorder always has this stigma associated with it ðŸ˜’
CBDhempBuds,estor2w,t3_c96pqw,1562270833.0,Exactly what I was looking for!
adhd_anxiety,estob97,t3_c96wp2,1562270601.0,I do!!
PaMedicalMarijuana,estgo5e,t3_c95958,1562267021.0,"Yep...Rise is here in York.  Some purists seem to not like any of them because some people say they all represent ""big marijuana"".
I agree with you, though, I would much rather support a place that is ethical in all their practices!"
PaMedicalMarijuana,estftcw,t1_estbmto,1562266605.0,I think they are opening a new dispensary soon in Harrisburg too if I am not mistaken...that will be super convenient! ðŸ™‚
PaMedicalMarijuana,estbucg,t1_estbmto,1562264980.0,Cool!  Sure thing!
PaMedicalMarijuana,estaabb,t1_est9ioe,1562264376.0,"I definitely have heard of issues with their website ðŸ˜’.
But it sounds like the timeframe would be about right for you to get yours by tomorrow!  I am also not too far out from Harrisburg either so the mail would only take a day to get here also."
socialanxiety,est6gac,t3_c8xlel,1562262864.0,Definitely can relate!
wicked_edge,est6b99,t3_c93ey2,1562262808.0,Classic shave for sure!
PaMedicalMarijuana,est5ybj,t1_est5boi,1562262668.0,So that was close to two months ago.  It seems like it is pretty quick if the doc gets you in the system.  Hers did it while she was at the visit!  Hope you get yours soon!
CBD,est5qbx,t1_est50sh,1562262581.0,Well it's cool that you got into the CBD biz...lots of people find it to really benefit them and without all the hassle of a MMJ program!
PaMedicalMarijuana,est5asq,t3_c95958,1562262415.0,This was just recently too....within the past two months and the doc said this was about an average time...one week.
PaMedicalMarijuana,est552c,t1_est4zbr,1562262356.0,So it was a Friday that she went to the doc and she had the card by Wednesday.
PaMedicalMarijuana,est47c3,t3_c95958,1562261962.0,My wife got her's within a week of having the doc certify her.  It was surprisingly fast for the state!
CBD,est3x9s,t1_est12eb,1562261847.0,Yep...about an hour.  The daily grind of the commute was too much for my anxiety!  One of the reasons I have been drawn to CBD!
CBD,essysoj,t1_esswc92,1562259693.0,I used to drive down there everyday for work!  I know exactly where you are located!
CBD,esssj0r,t3_c93mxj,1562257053.0,"York, PA here....may have to give you a visit!"
