StonerPhilosophy,fpwagdy,t1_fpw7urz,1588960026.0,"You might be doing to much at once, or you have really potent stuff. If you ever feel like giving it a chance again just try doing a really small amount. And make sure you're by yourself and don't have to talk to anyone for awhile. It might be the thought of having to ""act normal"" around other people. That's one of my triggers for anxiety with it. Dont overthink it. Start listening to some music right afterwards or playing a game. But if its not worth it to you i understand. Not everyone enjoys it the way others do."
StonerPhilosophy,fpw6kms,t1_fpw1z35,1588958136.0,"I noticed how (many) years ago when i first started smoking i'd get the classic paranoia and anxiety that it can give you sometimes, but as time went by and i kept smoking it faded and i got more comfortable and less worried about things, i just got used to it and the anxiety faded. Whenever i took a break for a long time and started again i'd feel the anxiety again, i think it just has to do with potency and your tolerance and enviroment. If you teach yourself (just like regular sober anxiety) whats actually worth the stress and what isnt, and practice staying calm and relaxing in the moments when you can get the anxiety, that you can slowly train it out of yourself."
