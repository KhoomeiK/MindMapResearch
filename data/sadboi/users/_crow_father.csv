A great man once said ""Someone's opinion of you doesn't have to become your reality.""

I know you're not lazy. You just don't know what you want in life so you're at a stuck point and that's okay. Lifes not about how many days you spend on this earth. It's about what you fit into those days that'll lead you to live a truely remarkable life.

Every gear and cog in a machine has a role to play and guess what. You may not like it but you are an essential part of this machine. It's okay to not be okay. Can't play the field for the entire game. So it's alright if you need to sit down. 

I was not a school learner. I'm a hands on learner. Maybe you are too? 

Just send me a message if you even just need to vent or anything really.

AskReddit,fjmmp6f,t3_fe13as,1583475365.0,Not a teacher but tutored some young teens in self defence twice a week for I think it was 8 months?. My reason for being late one night to the lesson was I had slipped and hurt my ankle. Then had to call for the lesson to end a little early. (usually went for two hours but I stopped it at 45 minutes). Turned out I had cracked my ankle. Good times. Good times.

YourGhostStories,ffbgtg5,t3_epm11n,1579764655.0,"Hello. I've worked in old folks homes here and there for part time night watchman. I was there just in case a person in the dementia ward had left their room and needed help.

Your story is one I've heard before but not as a kid. There was this one resident (not in the dementia ward) who was having a cup of tea (this was like 2am or something. She mentioned that something stopped her from falling over and off her bed. Apparently it was her recently departed husband or so she said. Apparently he liked to wear his brown coat everywhere. After taking her back to her room she almost fell over and just levitated for a second and stood back up and sat down on her bed. She looked so happy and said thank you. I left to go back to working but I could swear on my life that I saw a man in a brown coat appear for less than half a second to catch her. 

So it might be someone looking after you?"
