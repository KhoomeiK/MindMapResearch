The State is to oppose a High  Court challenge by John Waters and Gemma O’Doherty aimed at striking  down laws introduced by the State arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mr Waters and Ms O’Doherty claim the laws are flawed and unconstitutional. 

In  judicial review proceedings against the Minister for Health, Ireland  and the Attorney General they seek to have certain recently enacted  legislation declared null and void by a judge of the High Court.

The  legislation at issue includes the 2020 Health Preservation and  Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, the  2020 Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act Covid-19 Act and the  1947 Health Act (Affected Areas) Order.

Their proceedings are also aimed at striking down temporary restriction regulations brought in under the 1947 Health Act. 

Last  week, the High Court directed the application for permission to bring  the challenge should be heard on notice to the State respondents and the  matter was returned for mention before Ms Justice Deirdre Murphy on  Tuesday morning.

Prior to the hearing, more than 100 supporters of the plaintiffs gathered in the Four [Courts](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_topic=Courts)  complex. Some went into courtroom number one of the Four Courts while  others congregated in the Round Hall outside the courtroom. 

A  small number of gardaí monitored the situation and cleared supporters  from the courtroom before the judge came onto the bench just after 11am  arising from social distancing guidelines introduced by the Chief  Justice and the Presidents of the Courts arising out of the Covid-19  pandemic.

Gerard  Meehan BL, for the State, told the judge it will oppose the application  for leave to bring the challenge and asked for a two week adjournment  to allow his side prepare a sworn statement in response to the “quite  substantial” challenge. 

While  the State has been working on its response, things were taking longer  to get done in the current climate, particularly when dealing with  persons in the Department of Health, counsel said.

Given  that part of the challenge concerns how the laws in question were  enacted, the Dáil, the Seanad and the Ceann Comhairle would have to be  added to the proceedings as notice parties, counsel added.

Mr  Waters and Ms O’Doherty, represented themselves. While not not  objecting to the addition of the notice parties, they expressed strong  concerns about the adjournment application and said the leave  application needed to be heard as soon as possible.

Mr Waters said the State parties were attempting to “filibuster”, “procrastinate” and delay a “very important” matter. 

Outlining the nature of the action. Ms O’Doherty said what was happening regarding the lockdown was “outrageous”.

She  said people are being held under mass house arrest or fear being  interrogated by gardaí if they leave their homes. People should be  allowed go about their business and normal life must be allowed resume,  she said.

The  vast majority of people are unaffected by Covid-19 which, she said, was  “no threat to life”. The Irish people should be allowed to go outside  and “build up a herd immunity”, she said.

Ms O’Doherty said expert medical evidence supporting her claims will be presented to the court as part of the case.

Ms  Justice Murphy told Ms O’Doherty the court was not at this stage  considering what were substantial arguments in the action but was making  directions with a view to getting the application heard.

The  judge said she accepted the leave application raised issues that needed  to be heard and the leave hearing should be heard in two weeks time.  The judge adjourned the matter for a week when it will again be  mentioned for the purpose of an update on progress.

Earlier,  both applicants raised issues with the judge as to whether the  proceedings were being held in public. An application to let some or all  of the applicants supporters into the courtroom was dismissed by the  Judge.

The  judge said the case was being heard in public and was being reported on  by bona fide members of the media. She said not everyone could fit into  a courtroom and wondered, if a larger than capacity group wished to  attend a hearing, should the court have to move to the National  Convention Centre.

The  applicants expressed their dissatisfaction over the judge’s decision.  The judge said a digital audio recording of Tuesday’s proceedings should  be made available to the applicants."
