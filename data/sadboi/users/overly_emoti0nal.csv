lesbianfashionadvice,fiz1vj0,t3_famfpu,1582852172.0,I have a big problem with dysmorphia and clothing is a huge part of it. if certain parts of my body (like my waist) are accentuated too much or not enough I freak out. I think that's part of the reason why my gender expression has always been more feminine. I'm still exploring a lot in terms of dressing less traditionally feminine but every step has been more freeing :))
