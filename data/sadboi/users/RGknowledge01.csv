AskMan,exoitt0,t3_ctq5ys,1566477259.0,Hey sorry to hear that. I understand what it is like to feel like this. To let your mind wonder it does sometimes feel shit to start day dreaming about it all. I just started with a rubber band round my wrist it does help just pull it and let go it does stop me from constantly thinking about it. It works for me but might not for others

depression,eusnsj4,t1_eusn792,1564011059.0,When I was 12 I was raped everyday for 2 months by my use to be step brother. I was hurt so badly. I’ve told a few people about this. It’s been killing me day by day. I can’t leave my house some days because he’s moved from living with my dad to my home town. I can’t see his face without breaking down where I stop breathing. I try and try to muster up the confidence to leave the house but I can’t. I saw him while driving once and I threw up because of it. I had to get my mum to come get me and my car because I was so bad and she thought I had food poisoning. If I tell people I will have to admit to myself that I was raped. I always believed it was my fault somehow. I get scared to go out in public sometimes

depression,euk9203,t3_cgjvw9,1563885070.0,Honestly started feeling like this 4 years ago when I was 15 hated life. I have now decided if I have a really bad month i will get a piercing don’t know why but I did. I had a bad month last month so got my nose pierced strangely it has made me happy that I took the risk and people are complimenting it and it has made me happier so I guess I’m saying find a risk that if it works out will make you happy and stay strong always here for anyone if they need it
UnsentLetters,etev3yv,t3_cb3iy7,1562748255.0,I find it helpful to use the depression subreddit. It really does help to understand how many people it affects and they will always be there to help with advice. I have asked countless times and it does make at least me feel better and stopped me doing something that would hurt me. But I’m glad she got through to you and you’re safe. Everyone has bad days. You just need to remember no matter how gloomy it is there will be better days

depression,es8waee,t1_es8w1ne,1561718158.0,Yeah well when it’s gets so bad people with mental illness don’t use all of their brain power so they don’t see the full picture. It’s hard for people let alone anyone suffering mental illness. Why are you on this subreddit. Do you feel so shit about your life you have to attack anyone who’s in a bad situation to make yourself feel good. You actually don’t deserve happiness if you treat people like this. I really Pity you. You’re just a sad sack of shit
depression,es8vcn0,t1_es8u078,1561716804.0,You disgust me. Why are you on this thread. When people are at the point where they want to die. They don’t think about how it could effect others. That’s why they are here. Maybe to get something off their chest. Maybe to ask for our support to talk them down. Maybe just to vent but this subreddit is for people that will be supportive of each other as we all need something like this in life. We all go through dark places and we need to help one another

AskReddit,eqv07y3,t3_bzjwf7,1560338722.0,Me and my friend live in a small town in the uk so naturally once we got a car we would go to different places to explore. We went to this wooded area and it was summer time in the day so we went walking and notice someone was behind us and thought yeah they are just walking the same way we are. We kept mixing up the walks to go as confusing way as we could when we notice he kept following and then we started walking fast and he matched our speed and then we started running after a corner and he ran after us. We got round one corner and hid in the bushes and he ran and stopped and looked around and I was so scared but he kept running. It was so scary after a minute we got up and ran back to the car and left as soon as we could
