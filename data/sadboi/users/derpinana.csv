nba,fr1a63x,t1_fr18qeo,1589816114.0,"Yeah he was a great GM he put together Pippen, rodman and phil and he never got credit for that. It's amazing how emotional sports can get and it is raw emotions like for MJ it is personal and for Jerry not getting recognition it was also personal for him. 

Sports are like soap operas in itself and it's a place where everyone specially grown men cry"
nba,fr17hha,t1_fr0w28i,1589814701.0,"The documentary was extremely honest actually. The director said they tackled everything that everyone didnt- the gambling conspiracy, the drugs in chicago bulls before jordan era, the bullying inside the team, Pippen’s low salary, the backstabbing in management, Dennis’ partying, Jordan’s competitiveness, the trash talking, the isaiah issue, etc. And Michael not even once told them, “ don’t use that footage”."
nba,fr170wj,t1_fr0pyik,1589814458.0,"Love Phil Jackson so much after this, even him calling Dennis a Heyoka and bringing him in the team was amazing. Michael was aggressive and egoistic but don’t forget his intention and drive and why he did it. He was a son who wanted his dad’s approval and love. He didn’t do it solely for the money or fame ( although that’s a sweet part of the business ofc). He loved and respected the game so much that even though Pippen was also an amazing player it seemed he didn’t have that drive that Michael had."

I’ve been practicing yoga and meditating for 7 years and it absolutely resonated with me. Michael was not worried about the next game or the next year he was there to play and win and that single pointed focus is what being present is and becoming the best version of himself. It was total mind, body and soul connection and Phil brought that out from the team."
nba,fr15j5o,t1_fr0xf3p,1589813655.0,I think that’s why this documentary has been delayed as long as it had been because Jerry Krauss died 2017 so it would’ve been hard to create a documentary with an old sick and dying man as the team’s villain

nba,fr150nh,t1_fr0zfk5,1589813375.0,"It’s amazing. The director said he wanted to go through everything and not leave out anything- the gambling, jordan’s dad’s murder, the Isaiah issue, the competitiveness, the tyranny and the emotional side, dennis’ vacations, the drugs before Jordan came in to bulls, scottie’s injuries and breakdowns, Jerry krauss’ being bullied and bullying, the tell all book scandal, the baseball fail etc. 

And according to the director, no one even asked them to take out any part of the interview, not MJ at least. It may seem like it’s a hype up for Michael but it definitely tackled the criticisms and flaws and at the end he still came out as the GOAT, because despite everything he is the greatest of all time."

So if someone is not as interested in me then I think, hey they have the right to be with someone they want to be with and I wouldn’t want anyone to force themselves on me and vice versa. 

If someone is not interested or attracted to you just imagine yourself not attracted to that person who was also aattracted to you. You can’t force chemistry or yourself to like someone and even if you do it just feels so force and like a chore instead of the real thing."

China is claiming the south sea because it will benefit them but the Philippines was a former US colony and the PH president is now accepting aid from US again because China built a military base in one of their islands. China is taking advantage of the fact the US  shiP had to return to the US due to the corona virus and now China is bullying the smaller countries again. 

I think trump is an ass for the most part but if you have a country like China constantly terrorizing smaller countries and claiming borders and seas then it’s a clear threat not only to the smaller countries but to world freedom because of the disrespect to the rule of law. Can these reporters even imagine the amount of issues he has on his mind with all of these going on at the same time. He is clearly telling China US military is better than  Chinese military because of the shit China has been doing in the South Sea. I think this was triggered by the reporter looking asian and China’s propaganda that the virus started in the US"

Educate yourself that until recently China was too poor to invest on it's military that's why it can't terrorize other countries even if it wanted to. But that said it has never failed to terrorize it's own people. Educate yourself with the kidnappings, torture and brainwashing that happens inside china should you dare to speak against the CCP. Educate yourself of how without remorse they killed students protesting in tianamen, educate yourself of the oppresive cyber security in mainland that doesnt allow anyone to speak ill of the CCP if that happens you get a visit from the police or if you are lucky your credit score gets loweres which affects your potential to get a good job, school, home or opportunity to travel, educate yourself of how the jail anyone openly practicing religion, a catholic priest died in jail in China because of this, the most peaceful man, the dalai lama was driven out of tibet and archological artifacts destroyed because practicing religion is not allowed in China ( thus their inhumane laws), educate yourself of how they manipulate poorer countries with promises of ""helping"" wherein their goal is to control these countries. Tell me what help have they actually done for the philipines
Except claim their islands as military base that's why their president is again accepting millions in aid from Trump because illegally, China is claiming those islands. 

Educate yourself of how doctors and reporters have been threatened by the CCP when they reported the virus way back in november and even with the knowledge of the virus they allowed millions of chinese to travel globally on chinese new year jan 25. Educate yourself of how they also promised to help africa economically but again nothing has panned out instead they are extremely racist to africans in China even refusing them entry in malls or decline their requests to go home despite the quarantine. 

Educate yourself of how millions of muslims are locked up and brainwashed just because they are muslims and reportedly prisoners are the first in line for organ harvesting. It is a billion dollar business organ harvesting and in other countries it could take months to get a transplant but it takes weeks in China. 

Dude i could say sooooo much more but i am not getting paid to educate you. You damn well educate yourself. There is a reason why most nations are calling out China. And yes the US is not perfect and not a saint but the US is miles better."

China though is acting in offense even though it physically has no right over the south east asia sea. Literally it is in the coastline of the Philippines and vietnam and China is nowhere near it but of course it has to claim it because they are scared military wise just like they had to drive out the dalai lama to claim Tibet.
