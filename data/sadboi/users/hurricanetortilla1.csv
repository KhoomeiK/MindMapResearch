Feel amazing and in love initially then I realize that they aren‚Äôt the person I think they are. Spiral and break it off with them. I wish I could meet someone and care when I‚Äôm stable."
bipolar,fd6i52p,t3_ek141m,1578191391.0,So basically I was hypomanic a couple days ago and I messaged this guy from my program and now I have a date with him on Tuesday and he goes to my school and I don‚Äôt want to go anymore üò•

bipolar,fcnrltr,t3_ehmjxp,1577817104.0,"Started the year off with a hypomanic episode where I dated 2 guys in 2 weeks (I had never dated prior to that) that led into a depressive episode that got my hospitalized. I was taking latuda but I wasn‚Äôt taking it with the necessary calories so it wasn‚Äôt working and I had major stress from 2 deferred exams in my first year of university. Then I was really fucking depressed in the summer so I went to this therapy program which helped. Then I got prescribed Prozac which made me hypomanic. After that I started 2nd year in the fall and I went into a mixed episode in October which got me hospitalized again. Got discharged and was depressed till December. Got severely depressed in the end of December and was hospitalized again, had to defer an exam and got shit grades in my other courses (D+ and C+). Somewhat stable now, hopefully less of a rollercoaster in 2020."

I got a D+ and C+ in my courses so that happened due to my depressive episode and med side effects. Still feel like shit about that. I‚Äôm confused as to whether I‚Äôm hypomanic now since I‚Äôve been dancing, more talkative, the usual hypomania symptoms for me. I just really hope I can find stability one day and get into grad school."

bipolar,f772cp9,t3_dultw3,1573442052.0,I can tell you that it gets better. I‚Äôve reached a somewhat stable point in my mood after 3 years and several hospitalizations. For me I found the therapy really helped as well as finding the right balance of meds. My old meds made me so lethargic and tired I would sleep for 12 hours a night. I have now been taken off of them after a year of passing out as soon as I took them. Now I feel like I have my life back and can stay up and sleep 7-8 hours. Sending supportive vibes your way

BipolarReddit,f4jmxjq,t3_dkoc22,1571622461.0,"I usually plan out my days and week, making sure I take time for breaks and self care. Sleeping enough and putting an alarm to get up to study helps for me. Avoiding caffeine because for me it causes a bit of a high then a crash which is not helpful. Taking things one hour at a time and one topic at a time also helps. Making sure I eat meals, shower and spend time with loved ones is a must. Trying to avoid burn out is important."

BipolarReddit,f3zelav,t3_dhxj3p,1571267829.0,"Couple things I‚Äôve learned help since being diagnosed this year.
-therapy- CBT and DBT are good therapy options. Try and find a therapist who you can build trust with. 
-support system- having people to talk to about bipolar or just in general 
-medications- I always call meds the basis of stability 
-avoiding alcohol and caffeine- I don‚Äôt drink alcohol or caffeine since caffeine made my hypomanic episodes worse 
-peer support or support from other people living with mental illnesses 
-a good sleeping schedule 
-a routine 
-eating meals on time 
-exercise 
-self care activities like spending time outside or pampering yourself 

best of luck!"

bipolar,f3saldh,t3_dhu859,1571099708.0,"I‚Äôm in my second year studying psychology and I was hospitalized 1st year as well as 2nd year. Shit is hard. I have failed tests while hypomanic. I have cried in front of professors when depressed. Things can get really isolating. But a few things have stopped me from dropping out:
-planning out my week at the beginning of the week
-seeing profs and TAs for help
-my accommodations 
-sticking to a schedule
-avoiding things that can affect my mood like alcohol and caffeine
-joining 1 or 2 clubs that involve hanging out with people 
-spaces with peer support 

I know people who struggle with their mental health and they are still in school, maybe it takes them an extra year but they still do it. 
Sending good vibes :)"

bipolar,f3bd8l2,t1_f3a7x83,1570807562.0,I think I‚Äôm slipping into a depressive episode and I feel so much anger towards people and utterly feel like they have let me down. I too sometimes feel like the reason why I‚Äôm so alone right now and have pushed away all potential friends is because when I‚Äôm hypomanic I do shit I regret and when I‚Äôm depressed people don‚Äôt want to be around me (I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl). This makes university really fucking hard. I don‚Äôt have a stable group of friends that I study with. I‚Äôm trying my best to not isolate myself but I can‚Äôt even imagine being in a romantic relationship when I can barely keep a friendship.
