mentalillness,fr390is,t3_gm9yo3,1589852391.0,"I think people glorify mental illness (not just in the media and on TV, but in real life too) because it makes them feel important, unique, edgy, etc. It’s been bothering me for a while how so many people say they have depression when they’re just sad or having a bad day - real, clinical depression is so much more than that and I hate how much it has gotten misrepresented as of late. The depression thing is just one of many. True mental illness IS awful. It’s not cute. It’s not fun. It’s not quirky."

If you’re not disturbing others/causing harm or infringing upon any other basic human rights or those of the environment, then what the hell is so wrong with sleeping in your car?

BPD,fq0drxr,t3_gg4gkm,1589030458.0,"Most of the positive posts I’ve seen are attempts to make a shitty disorder feel less shitty. I think it’s great. The cycle of negativity that borderlines go through is already so dark negative, I think it’s nice to try and be positive once and while. Yeah, BPD sucks... it totally does. But it doesn’t mean we’re complete and total hopeless monsters or something. Being positive and encouraging can be really helpful- not just for me, but I’m sure for others too. Soothing almost. The more we look at it as a curse, the more it’s going to feel like one. Again, BPD totally freaking sucks, but it’s not a bad thing that others are trying to be positive."

BPD,fpt1tta,t3_gf94dg,1588883392.0,"Well said, OP. I have felt similarly as of late. It’s sad the mental illness seems to be ‘trending’ in that people are going so far as to say they have something when in fact they don’t or have received no actual diagnosis. It’s very invalidating and insensitive toward those of us that actually have the mental illness."

When I got diagnosed, my whole support system treated me like a case study. It was so frustrating. My family acted like they wanted to analyze and then fix me. I know that was just them trying to understand, but for WEEKS it felt like they were blaming everything I did on my BPD. It was nauseating and really hard to deal with. 

In short, I hear you and I can relate."
therapy,fowvfqk,t3_ga0zt4,1588128000.0,People are shitty and that’s the truth. I’m sorry for what has happened to you. You’re not bad for having the thought patterns/habits that you do. That is how your brain has conditioned itself to think in attempt to protect you. My greatest tip? Be patient with yourself and maybe look into trying to figure out some of this with a therapist. :)

AskWomen,fow7yb9,t3_g9kj6z,1588114681.0,"Me and my husband went to a very small, private school and met in the first grade. We have always been close and know each other very well. Senior year of high school is when we actually started to date. Funny thing is both of us left the small, private school we had both attended for 11+ years and went to completely separate public high schools. How we started speaking again is a very long story, but I’m so glad it happened. I had always loved him and he admitted to having loved me for all the time we’ve known each other. His mom frequently brings up how he had a MASSIVE crush on me in elementary school - why we didn’t start dating sooner in high school or in middle school? I don’t know, but I think it’s better we didn’t because we may not be together today. We both had the opportunity to grow and learn from other relationships and were both able to appreciate commitment and love with each other on a much higher level thanks to our pasts. 

We attended separate colleges for our first semester of freshman year, but stayed together. It was hard. I transferred to his school that spring. Sophomore year we got married in the courthouse. 

Fast forward to today, we’re happily married, still very much in love, and I’m nine months pregnant with our first baby! We have been through a lot together and it’s never been easy having gotten married so young. I knew he was “The One” pretty quickly, and for me to have known/felt that is a big deal because I had always been skeptical of love. My respect for men is not very high, but my hubby is different and he always has been. He is gentle, kind, patient, mature, and understands pain (I have a lot of trauma and mental health issues). We share a sense of humor and are still inseparable (even though some days we really do get on each other’s nerves). Our love has definitely evolved over time and it is not the same, but some of the best things in life get better with age. 

As to backlash, we simply endured it, but it wasn’t a lot considering it’s pretty clear to everyone that we are a good match. I think there have been moments throughout our relationship that have definitely been clouded with naivety, but the rose colored glasses always come off at some point and you have to either accept love for what it is or don’t. My husband and I are still learning. That’s what marriage is - you’re forever “getting to know” your partner. The key, I think, is to stick by each other and work together in learning what love really is. And it’s going to be unique to every couple and their set of circumstances. 

Hope some of this made sense, lol! Thanks to anyone who read the whole thing. 😘"
CPTSD,fovpc6e,t3_g9k2gr,1588105206.0,"I totally can relate to this post. I have such an incredibly hard time with professionals because of how I have been treated in the past. I’ve been invalidated, cut short, jerked around with referrals and diagnoses, and my previous therapist (she was quite old) would fall asleep in our sessions! 

Often times I’ll get in front of a doc/therapist and my brain will literally block off any sort of emotion or remembrance of my struggles. It’s the most frustrating thing! A huge barrier is me thinking my problems/struggles aren’t significant enough, I’m just wasting the other persons time, and that I can fix everything on my own. 

I’m learning from all this that self advocacy is key. Professionals are so busy and have so many patients that sometimes it’s hard for them to look at patients as individuals. It’s honestly infuriating when I have to DEMAND to be heard, but that feels better in the end than continuing to try and deal with my mental health issues on my own."

unpopularopinion,fopanzg,t3_g8hdc7,1587956850.0,"I hate watching children get messed up by unhealthy adults. Children are beautiful and pure and I wish we all could stay so naive forever. However, I believe every human child is bound to get traumatized whether that be by one’s own parents, peers, authoritative figures, and so on. Trauma and hardship and all that fun stuff is part of growing up and becoming an adult. 

That being said, I agree with you 100%. No one should bring a child into this world selfishly or with such deeply rooted issues that it will harm the mental (and possibly physical) stability and safety of their child. The world could be a lot better place if it’s inhabitants were healthier, loved each other more, and behaved more selflessly. 

The change starts somewhere and I’m going let it start with me and I hope that whoever reads this also chooses to let it start with you. :)"

I can’t even imagine if my doc said things like that to me! I probably would never go to them again. I’m really sorry this happened to you.
