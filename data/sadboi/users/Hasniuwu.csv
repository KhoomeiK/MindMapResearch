AskReddit,f1k8fgf,t1_f1k6c5b,1569532976.0,"Look, I don't want to lash out, but I might. 

As far as hobbies go, I got gym. 

And ofcourse my doctors believe my mental illness, but I'm not around my doctors all the time. I'm around my parents and my friends who understand jack shit. And I'm trying to educate my parents and I've removed all toxic friends from my life. I'm pretty sure I'm on the right path. 

Also, I'm not trying to JUSTIFY crimes like school shootings, I'm trying to show that there are causes and reasons for crimes like that which can be easily reduced or rectified. 

An interviewer asked Marilyn Manson what he would say to the perpetrators of the Columbine Massacre if they were infront of him. He answered ""I wouldn't say anything. I would just listen to them, which no one else did."""

AskReddit,f1k32hd,t1_f1k1eeh,1569531154.0,"I take meds AND therapy. And my parents don't even believe in mental illnesses, I took myself to a hospital. However, external factors affect my illness, factors I can't control. I'm trying my best. Also, I've lashed out. I used to hit my infant brother. I literally didn't even realize what I was doing until I had done it. And I hate myself for it. 


I'm sure eveyone suffers frustrations and problems in life. My problems aren't unique, neither does my illness make me special. But you can't deny that my illness affects my thinking. Where you might see reasonable solutions to your problems, I don't. That's just how it is. I can't control it. I'm boxed in. 

And ranting about teenage angst on the internet is way better than acting on it in real life, no?"

AskReddit,f1jz0qt,t1_f1jtxvo,1569529710.0,"You're talking about normal people. Unchecked mental illnesses are a huge cause of crimes like these. Alot of people who are mentally sick don't go around shooting up schools. But my illness (and a bunch of other illnesses) makes it very, extremely hard for me to think clearly and to not feel hatred for other people. I can become very selfish and can't see anything except for my own suffering. The only way to cope with that is to take it out on something. And I'm tired of taking it out on myself. My illness makes it very difficult to feel remorse for others when I myself am in pain. 


 If you have lung cancer and leave it untreated, and keep smoking cigarettes, you're gonna die mate. You can't expect not to. Similarly, if you're mentally sick, and it's untreated, and it keeps getting aggravated, you're gonna lash out. Now, here (especially in my case) you'll not be the one lashing out. It'll be your illness. The best way to describe BPD would be to watch someone else fuck up your life.

This is the problem. She could be perfect and I would still worry. 

Yeah, I did pick them out individually. And I ghosted all of them. And would prolly hold a grudge against them for a long time."
AskReddit,f1jf0f8,t1_f1jc9f0,1569522404.0,"*Friends* : 

I have only 1 real friend. I can't seem to form positive connections with people. Maybe, I just have a boring personality? That's prolly not the case because I can attract people, but the bond is just not there. That upsets me. What's guy without any friends?  Plus, I had a few friends but I isolated myself from them because they made fun of me having a breakdown. They also don't believe I'm mentally sick even though I've received an actual diagnosis from a doctor. They love to tell me it's all in my head. I also get taunted sometimes because of my self harm. Now that I've ghosted all of them they prolly labeled me a pussy. 



*Success* : 

I'm actually great at my studies, I've always been a straight A student. Unfortunately, that's caused people to hold a certain standard over my head. I'm very ambitious myself. And the thought that I might fuck up scares me shitless.



*Parents* : 

I don't have the greatest relationship with my parents. It's mainly due to my mental issues (BPD). They try their best to accommodate me but ofcourse, both sides lash out at wach other sometime. I love them very much tho. And Im afraid if I'll be able to take care of them when they get old. 



*Girlfriend* : 

I had a girlfriend. I couldn't live with the thought that she might cheat on me. Or that she might get bored, find someone better or just fall out of love and leave me. No matter how much I was reassured of her love, I couldn't get these thoughts out of my head. Plus, she decided to break up with me (twice) for religious reasons. But still kept talking to other guys. But still always said she loved me. That was very disturbing. So I broke up with her, offered no explanation and ghosted her. What would happens when I get married? Would I always be this anxious and paranoid? 



*Mental Illness* : 

I suffer from BPD. I won't go on a rant about my symptoms. Just that people don't believe me. They think I've made myself believe I'm sick, so that's why I face these symptoms. I believe 100% that I'm a difficult person. But I'm suffering and no one is even batting an eye, that shit is maddening. And when I lash out that's when everyone is worried or upset or angry. And then people ask how are murderers made? Then they ask why do people shoot up schools?  It's cause maybe if you refused to validate their problems. 

That's all for now. I'll add on to this list, if something comes to mind.

EDIT:

This is a weird one. 

*Women* : 

I had a fight with a few female class fellows when I was like 10 years old. And since then I've hated women. I know how wrong that is. But whatever I do I can't seem to let go of my ever increasing hate for women. I find them very annoying, dramatic, and emotional. I also hate that women get favoured in my society. I'm actually afraid of women. I'd give anything to be asexual so I wouldn't have to do anything with women."
