I have to tell you that, despite the horrible things that happened in your life, there is still the possibility to live a life you'll be proud to have lived in the long run. It would be a good thing to stay away from those who have abused you if possible. And with time and efforts you'll have moments of happiness too. For your best friend, my deepest condolences. Don't try to kill yourself for it would only throw away all the hope and possible future hapiness you might have in the future. Everyone dies one day, so you'll end up meeting her again anyway. Please try and take care of yourself and renounce to try and commit suicide. There are sufferings in life but there are great moments to enjoy too, even for people with mental ilnesses. I wish you the best."

schizophrenia,eyp6gow,t3_cy167j,1567291417.0,"Regarding mental health, no issue that you might be fighting against is dumb and you shouldn't be ashamed to express these issues. You were afraid of being judged but you still shared all this. So, good job for doing so. But regarding what you were saying, though it is against ethics for some cultures to go against your parents wishes, nothing obligates you to them. You are free to accept their wishes for yourself or to reject them. Children are not born to be slaves but to be a whole person themselves. You grow to be your own self, separate from the others. And with your free will, you'll make your own choices and thus be free from this ""slavery"" you're speaking of. I hope my word resonate well with you and I wish you the best."
