schizophrenia,etk6ei7,t1_etk3x2q,1562890083.0,"I’ve just moved to Florida from Georgia and we had there something similar to California. You could sign a paper to be released after the 72 hour hold. In Florida the patient had no recourse. It blows my mind. 

Yeah just for delusions. Wasn’t a danger to myself or others and it was just my second appointment with them. I think they just wanted to stop dealing with me as a patient and knew after they did this I probably wouldn’t return to their office again."

schizophrenia,esr3zwq,t1_esqvxlp,1562216017.0,That’s what I’m wondering if my meds just mute symptoms vs erasing them. My symptoms seem to be just under the surface and come up so frequently. I’m only been diagnosed since March 18 so maybe it’s just not right med combo.
schizophrenia,esr3t59,t1_esqiiqf,1562215901.0,Thank you! I’ll see about dosage or maybe changing the meds.
schizophrenia,esr3ra3,t1_esqi5sh,1562215870.0,That’s what I’m wondering too. I guess sometimes the meds just mute the symptoms but don’t get rid of them. I hope that’s not the case for either of us.

schizophrenia,es50oui,t1_es4xz25,1561598832.0,"Umm kind of I guess. It’s like I’m hearing someone else’s thoughts. It’s not really like depression. When it first started the voice was very friendly. Had like a running banter about my day and what I was doing. I started to like to voice. Then one day it turned dark and would encourage me to commit suicide. It would cuss at me, call me names, belittle my character, etc. I was scared of it but didn’t have anywhere to run because it was always there. Medicine has helped ALOT but I still hear him I just try and ignore it as much as I can."

schizophrenia,es4zm6f,t1_es346h4,1561598066.0,Absolutely! I find myself doubting my symptoms that my family say I’m showing and then I start to doubt them and their ability to reason. I find myself often times thinking the whole thing is a scam by my doctors and therapist to make money and to have a job - if there wasn’t any ‘crazy’ people then they would be out of a job so they must have just made up something to keep treating me. Then I go off meds and start to feel wonderful until I don’t and then usually have to go back into the hospital to get stabilized.
schizophrenia,es4z925,t3_c5twqa,1561597802.0,"If you aren’t sleeping, and you’re like me, psychosis will come and all hell will break. I’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping too and the ONLY thing I’ve found that helps me is taking a hot bath. The other day I actually slept the whole night in the bathtub - embarrassing I know. 

If you do feel like you need care I would recommend a hospital setting. They can help you get some peace and treat anything that might be causing your sleep deprivation- like anxiety or something.  Good luck."
schizophrenia,es4xl6d,t1_es4a3c6,1561596560.0,"I second this! My voice started off as fun and jovial until it wasn’t. By that time I was used to my voice and agreed and/or did things it asked me too. Then it got dark on a dime and it was no longer fun but agonizing. 

Talk to your Pdoc about this and hopefully you can get some medication going for this and the anxiety."
schizophrenia,es4wwtu,t3_c5yifa,1561596044.0,Is he unstable or people just tell you that? I think that makes a huge difference. If he’s stable and you want to visit that certainly won’t do any harm. Sometimes people stigmatize SZ.

As far as the stay it greatly depends on what floor you will be on. I’ve always been on the acute wards and it’s scary (some violent people going through some serious stuff). Once you get the lay of how things work it gets easier. Therapy sessions, speaking with your psychiatrist, when to eat, when to sleep, etc.

He’s also a tried and true Republican and feels that people who rely on the government for money are free loaders and should be working (I’m currently applying for disibility). I think all of these things, and others that I’m unaware of, shape his opinion about mental illness. 

It wasn’t until I was hospitalized for auditory hallucinations that I think it sunk in to him. I had him there on purpose with the intake nurse to tell him what was going on.
