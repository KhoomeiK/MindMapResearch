I also hope door dash/skip shuts down cause I feel that’s the only reason we are open. I’ve also been helping my mother out with groceries since she’s out of work and she has CAD I can’t pick up groceries for her as I feel I am still going to transmit it if I am asymptomatic. 

I will keep my distance serving people and stay home when I’m not working.

nba,fft4m1q,t3_ev3hy6,1580206837.0,"I became a celtics/basketball fan at first in 2002/2003 when i watched Paul Pierce play and the colours of the team. If you're a celts fan youre not a Lakers fan..I was so excited to watch the finals through 2008-10 because of the rivalry and I hated Kobe at the time not only cause he was a Laker but because he was so fucking great, he was a PROBLEM. I truly believe all the Kobe Haters hated him cause he was so great at beating your team there was no other reason to hate him, i was one. 

As i watched him throughout the years i slowly began to idolize him because of his fierce competitiveness he had, his DNA was built differently he was always clutch.  It became so hard to keep hating on his greatness, you wanted to be him. Then you continue to watch him off the court talking about family and life and sharing stories, just such a great person.   


Now you read all these stories about peoples lives he touched outside of the sport after his passing. Its so hard to swallow this one man,, i woke up again and couldn't believe it. He changed the game and i don't think we'll see a player like him in a long time. RIP"
