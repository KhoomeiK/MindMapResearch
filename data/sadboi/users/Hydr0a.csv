WatchRedditDie,fqfew44,t3_gim64j,1589323662.0,"Recently I have discovered this subreddit.  I didn’t really care at first until I started going through posts and seeing just people shitting on white people. 

 I thought to myself, “if r/fragilewhiteredditor is real, is r/fragileblackredditor real?”.  Sure thing that subreddit was, but it only directs back to the original community.

Now upon reading the subreddit, you can see multiple auto moderator posts asking the same question, “why are wh*te people the way they are?”.  I decided to answer the question simply by saying the following. “We where raised by our families who passed down their culture for generations.”.  Nearly two minutes later I received this: https://imgur.com/a/fAgHWW6

TL;DR:  white people are the only fragile race on reddit."

I'm sure this extends to more things besides reddit but It's getting extremely obnoxious and I've noticed this here as a white person. It can be a post a white person made, a post featuring a white person, doesn't seem to matter. Somehow some commenter always finds a way to bring up their race whether it's saying tasteless joke, claiming ""pandering"" because a white person is on the front page of r/gifs or something, or just casually grouping white people together with some good old racism.

I've been seeing it a lot lately and it's just tiring and disheartening. I also see posts here that jumble white people together in pretty passively racist ways. This is just a rant and yeah a lot of people don't do any of the things I just mentioned but it still hurts to see."

This works best on silk moths so your in luck

Make an incision just enough to open up the outer layer that holds the actual chrysalis.  Do this on the upper area to assure you don’t cut the chrysalis inside.

When the moth is about to hatch the color should be very dark.

I suggest watching a video on how to do it."
