AskDID,fmv62by,t3_fxg53r,1586407038.0,"Everyone dissociates from time to time. Walking into a room and forgetting why you’re there is pretty common. You should be concerned if you’re forgetting major parts of your life, or if people keep reminding you of big things, like fights, major parties, out of character decisions, medical issues, natural disasters, or travel experiences you don’t remember.

For me amnesia takes the form of not remembering college. Like, I know where I attended college and worked. I know I studied graphic design, I know who my roommate and boyfriend were, but I don’t remember my classes or a single thing about how to design. I know I use photoshop to make things, but I don’t know what the tools do, or even what makes a good design. There’s a whole semester I only remember because I journaled about it and friends filled me in later. 

However I usually become aware of my amnesia when one of my roommates reminds me of something. For example. I had a roommate who was obsessed with a song for a long time. I even performed this song with him. Almost a year later my other roommate mentioned the song and I swore up and down for 30 minutes I had never heard it or heard of the movie it came from."

DID,flq3wzg,t3_fqayj3,1585378133.0,"I get this so much, but for me it was one assignment that really drove the point home. In one of my art classes I had to make a “personality box”. The instructor gave each person in the class a shadow box and asked us to fill it with things that represented our personality. There was one box however that was slightly smaller than the rest of the class, with four additional 4x6 sized boxes. I requested this set of boxes and put a little doll in each little box to represent each of what I now understand to be my alters, although at the time I thought was just voices in my head. Then in the main box I created a shattered collage of handwritten song lyrics for the background and of course all the handwriting was different. I was so proud of myself for finally creating a representation of my broken personality as I understood it, but trying to explain my personality box in a way that didn’t make me look like a crazy person was an embarrassing mess.  I couldn’t bring myself to throw the thing away, so I hid it and pretended it didn’t happen. It was another 3 years before I got diagnosed. Now when I have days where I feel like I’m faking it all I can look back at that piece and remember that this has been a long journey."

Adventists have traditionally believed in religious liberty, and keeping politics and religion separate. Until the last 20 or 30 years Adventists would not enlist in the military and would ask for a non-combatant role when drafted, however in North America as Christianity as a whole has moved to the right politically, Adventist’s have followed to the point where it is no longer taboo to enlist, bear arms and talk openly and positively about patriotism and fighting in war in church.

I helped with Sabbath School, led praise team, played piano, and did everything pathfinders. I also did all the Adventist schooling things through college and was home schooled when attending Adventist school was not an option. Study of prophecy was part of daily family worship and any time anything bad happened in the world (Iraq war, 2008 crash, hurricane Katrina) my parents would go on about how the end was soon. 

I started to see my way out of the church after the 2015 general conference, but the nightmares of the end times remain. I am now in therapy for PTSD from this and some other experiences. One thing that I have learned is that sometimes you have to calm your body down in order to calm your mind down. I practice yoga, and mindfulness meditation, try to eat a healthy plant based, whole grain diet and go on walks regularly. 

Try to maintain as much as your schedule as you can. If you notice something triggers your anxiety make note of why and how it makes you feel so you can avoid or work through it. Whatever is best for you. Turn off the news and focus on what is right here, in front of you, right now. Life is still beautiful. Do you know anyone who knows anyone who is sick yet?

Later in the year when I was dealing with some anniversary triggers I started cutting much more frequently, and as I promised I shared and we reviewed the plan again and she encouraged me to give all my tools to her or a trusted friend until I was feeling better.

AskDID,fhwoq6m,t3_f54kr1,1581923284.0,"Treatment for DID is three phased. Phase one focuses on safety, stabilization, acceptance of the diagnosis and cooperation of parts/alters to improve day to day functioning. Phase two is about trauma processing. Phase three is acceptance of and mourning of the past, increased communication and cooperation of parts/alters and becoming the person you want to be. These things aren’t always linear. 

Current guidelines say this process takes about 3 years, it’s not uncommon for it to take much longer. Talk therapy is the main treatment, this can include many different techniques and modalities. EMDR is sometimes used for trauma processing. Medication can be used to manage symptoms such as poor sleep, or treat comorbid disorders such as anxiety or depression.

What’s most important is finding a therapist you trust and can build a good connection with. They’ll know how to pace treatment to help you get better while maintaining day-to-day functioning. Hang in there. Things tend to get worse before getting better, especially when accepting multiplicity and the trauma that caused it, but things do eventually get better. I’ve been in treatment for about a year now, and I am already doing so much better than I ever thought I could.

Seriously though, everyone is different. Your DID won’t look like anyone else’s and you don’t need strangers on the internet to validate it. Your existence as multiple and the fact that you experience switching is all the validation you need, even if it doesn’t feel like that. 

Of course, if you are concerned about your switching, or you find it is impairing your ability to live a healthy, meaningful life, then please work with a therapist.

It might not be the whole truth, or the truth as you remember it, but it is the truth as I remember it. I’m doing my best to be honest, even if it’s difficult and confusing. And please don’t use my memory issues against me. I’m doing my best. If it’s too stressful for you then just get out of my life. I would much rather you be honest about that then yell at me for not remembering."
AskDID,fe0dtt2,t1_fe0adjq,1578811205.0,"I did listen to that episode with Colin Ross. It was very informative and compassionate, something I would consider sharing with people in my life who want to know more. 

I’m not aware of any of the drama. We’re fairly new to the community, but that does sound rather stressful, and unfortunate. I’m glad to hear that’s in the past, and I can understand why you aren’t into that show.

I definitely get the feeling that DID YouTubers, are rather controversial around here. I personally am not into the YouTube scene. That’s mostly because I don’t have the patience to sit through a video, but I’ll read almost anything. Any blog recommendations?"
exAdventist,fe0d6rt,t1_fdzmywb,1578810507.0,"Don’t get me wrong, I also only had the choice of some Adventist colleges/universities, for the same reason, but I didn’t choose that one. I just don’t feel comfortable sharing where I did go for privacy reasons."
exAdventist,fdyycpj,t3_endg3o,1578784790.0,It sounds like you have more together than you think you do. You’re way ahead of where I was at 22. I also had to drop out of school for mental health reasons. It’s the worst. I hope you’re able to go back and finish with welding. Have some faith in yourself. You got this!
exAdventist,fdyt8b3,t1_fdyoqja,1578783376.0,"Wow, that’s a lot to go through, and the way they changed their minds on University is really messed up. I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with all these things. It’s really tough to grow up when your parents won’t let you, especially since you live in a town with no opportunities. You mentioned community college, is it an option? And would it help you get better jobs where you live? It might be worth sticking Adventism out a little bit longer to get on a better financial footing.

I get what you’re saying about your church having connections in Denver. It seems like all Adventist’s know each other. What are you afraid they will do to you? If you are working outside the Adventist system, not relying on your family’s money, and living with your friends what can your parents’ connections do to you? They can rant and guilt trip but you’ll be free.

Whatever you choose, start by working to be financially independent. Get your own phone plan, your own car insurance, and your own savings and bank account they can’t touch. I know you’re already looking for better jobs. Keep up the good work. Save as much as you can, so if shit does hit the fan you can move without too many complications. Taking those first steps to independence are the hardest, but they’re worth it, and every step step will make you happier and stronger."
exAdventist,fdymvoj,t3_endg3o,1578781482.0,"It sounds like your best choice might be to leave town. Is going to college, even an Adventist college if that’s what it takes, an option? If it isn’t, do you have any friends who left town who might be able to give you a place to live for a few weeks while you looked for a job? 

Or if you have to stay in your current town is there any way you can adjust your work schedule to be during church? Your parents would hate it, but it would get the point across that you really aren’t Adventist and have no interest in going to church without a yelling match every Saturday. If you’re worried about being kicked out is moving out with your brother an option? It sounds like you two might be close, and both want out. There are always options, I hope you find one that works for you. Good luck."
AskDID,fdyhfyy,t1_fdxltuh,1578779830.0,Awesome! Thanks for considering this. While I know these are skills everyone has to develop I think it’s more difficult for those of us with psychiatric issues. Idk. I’m excited to hear your take on things!
exAdventist,fdx7hij,t1_fdhogki,1578766041.0,"Yeah, I’ve seen this. It’s basically true if you live in any small Adventist college town like Keene. I didn’t go there for that reason."
AskDID,fdx72lj,t1_fdur2w2,1578765959.0,"That’s awesome! I’ll check it out. Of course, talk about whatever you want to talk about. I feel like I’ve heard/read a lot about the theory of structural dissociation, and I’m pretty well versed in grounding techniques for getting through the worst PTSD symptoms. What I would love to hear more about is how to develop emotional intelligence, like how to learn how to have healthy boundaries and expectations, or how to be honest with people about what’s going on without sharing too much and scaring them off, or what it’s like to want and do things for yourself after a lifetime of living to make other people happy, or maybe something about living with shame and stigma. Cause like, there’s lots of clinical research and that’s all well and good, but doesn’t help much with the day to day living of learning how to be a normal, healthy person."
AskDID,fdx44ge,t1_fdr64y9,1578765119.0,"I started binging it today, and got to the episode where they interviewed the Colin Ross about the four definitions of dissociation. I appreciate the emphasis on facts and theories to back up and explain the narrative parts. Thanks for sharing!"

actuallesbians,fdmkaaa,t3_em2586,1578553060.0,Yep happened to me. Fortunately we’re still best friends.
AskDID,fdmk1u2,t1_fdmatrc,1578552791.0,"Wow, I actually was not offended by this. Thanks for sharing!"
AskDID,fdmjrkf,t3_em4chw,1578552474.0,"Trust your gut on this one. 

While over sharing personal details can be a response to life trauma, most people with DID don’t come out to strangers or new friends. In the 7 years I have known I am multiple, I have only come out to 5 people, including my therapist. The other person I know with DID has only come out to close friends and family, about 10 people. And while everyone’s system is different, and most systems can’t switch on demand, it is odd that someone would go through several obvious switches in front of someone they hardly know. DID develops as a defense mechanism, and is usually covert.

With that said, if this is a friendship you want to peruse, just be a good friend and treat them like you would treat anyone else. Hang out, get food, do things you like to do together. Clearly your new friend has been through a lot. Be supportive and respectful and listen to whatever they want to share. Take it seriously even if it sounds crazy. The best thing you can do for a person with DID is respect their boundaries. The second best is to believe them. Remember that they have memory issues, and something that you might think is a lie, is the truth as they remember it. You might also hear the same story several times from different perspectives, or have to keep reminding them of something you find important. Be patient and understanding. 

Of course, as you would with any friend, make sure you’re still taking care of yourself and not getting too sucked into their world, Don’t worry about them hurting you any more than you would worry about any other new friend without DID hurting you. There are a lot of bad, inaccurate media portrayals which causes a stigma for anyone with the diagnosis, and makes it difficult for many of us to be out. All of us have been hurt, stereotyped and disbelieved. Part of what this disorder does is to take all the anger that we feel at the world and turn it inwards on ourselves. Most of us, including our mean, violent parts, are much, much more likely to hurt ourselves than anyone else."

DIDmemes,fdm044h,t3_em2ix2,1578536637.0,"I feel this on so many levels. Nightmares are the worst, but your art is beautiful! If this is something you’re currently dealing with, hang in there."
DID,fdlwvbq,t3_em1s82,1578534426.0,Yay!!! That’s amazing! I’m so happy for you!
exAdventist,fdgt01h,t3_el39bl,1578407554.0,"You are not alone. I (24 F) have been diagnosed with chronic PTSD in part related to these things. I am currently in therapy. PTSD and religious trauma are not something to be taken lightly, especially when it’s interfering with your sleep. These past few days have been miserable with all the news out of Iran and Australia. And I hate that even though I rationally know there is no end coming and I will not suffer persecution, I still can’t stop listening to the news, and mentally going over all the things I will need to do when I run to the hills. It doesn’t help that the real news announcer’s voice sounds like the voice overs in every apocalyptic movie ever because the news is so bad. And of course, there are always the nightmares. Mine always end with having to testify against my family in court and send them to their deaths now that I’m out of the church. 

What I’ve found helps is to focus on other things. Spend time in person with people who are understanding. Do simple repetitive tasks to care for yourself and ground yourself in the present like cooking or cleaning or making a craft. Keep a journal and write about your fears. Volunteer for a cause you believe in. Enjoy time in nature, or if it’s too cold outside enjoy some light hearted fiction. I struggle with this one. Triggers are everywhere because Adventism has its opinions about everything. Keep reminding yourself that you are safe and free and building the life you want.

And please, if you feel like you need it, and are in a place where you can afford or access it, go to therapy. PTSD is a real health issue, and treating it can make your life much better. Hang in there."
exAdventist,fdg4u2h,t1_fdfgdek,1578380062.0,Haha that’s great! Good for you for doing what you wanted regardless of what your mom thought. That moment at graduation must have been so much fun! It never ceases to amaze me how much Adventist parents care about appearance it’s almost as if what’s on your head is more important than what’s in your head when it comes to getting into heaven.

lincoln,fdf2iyp,t1_fdf2e8m,1578351833.0,"My bad, it’s 48th and pioneers on the other side of the gas station. Just go down half a block. Also, Penelope’s is only open in the morning/early afternoon."
SelfHarmScars,fddnef2,t1_fdb0ulj,1578318612.0,I’m so sorry to hear. That must be so difficult. Hang in there. I hope you’re able to get the treatment you need.
