C) My dick works absolutely fine. I keep it in the drawer next my bed and it takes 2 AA batteries to work.

I was angry at the point of drawing so I scribbled lines to draw, also i’m not a good artist so drawing things out exactly as I see them is difficult. I don’t draw faces purely and simply because they’re hard, no other reasons, and the body shape is definitely human.

This is a big step in my mental health recovery and I don’t appreciate you jumping in and trying to say it’s because I was abducted, that invalidates my feelings and thoughts as well as my mental health issues.

As a child I was taken by aliens and they were little and green with eyes like cats, they had 18 fingers on each hand. One of their fingers was their special probing finger, it tasted like strawberries. They’re ship was shaped like the titanic although i’m fairly sure this was a delusion as my mind could not comprehend their 5 dimensional reality. They taught me their language, then they told me the secret to harmonious living was for man to lay with man and woman to lay with woman. One of them looked human, he wore a bow tie and braces, told me to get in this little blue box, which was bigger on the inside. He told me to run a lot, which was strange because I was strapped to a table at the time. He called himself The Surgeon. I commented that he looked human and he told me that I looked Tunc Dominus, whatever that means.

I don’t know how long I was gone but they returned me to my bed without any time passing so they must have cracked time travel. Space was beautiful man, zero g is like totally out of this world.

I mean tiny goals, like get out of bed, get dressed, eat something today.
