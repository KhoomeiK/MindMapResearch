the problem with content writing and freelancing is beginners get paid too low for the amount of effort, but for 3-4k, it shouldn't be too burdensome.

thank you for sharing

i don't have advice, but can I offer you a hug? 

i can empathize. my mother has far milder psychological / personality issues, and it is nigh impossible to get her to see any of it. a calm and rational discussion, initiated by me, ends up with her hurt, upset and offended.

my most recent realization is that i want her to know and feel that i love her, and that i'm on her side. this is because after a few months of confrontations, it isn't obvious to her that I'm not hating on her when i'm pointing out her fallacies etc. so right now i'm gathering the strength to give her the affection that i know she is starting to miss.

that is stage 1. and frankly, i am clueless on what stage 2 is gonna be, but if i succeed in stage 1, at least that would be worthwhile in itself. 

what i do know, and have always known, that even the calmest and most rational discussion, is never going to help me get through to her. it doesn't work with most people when you're pointing out their mistakes and blind spots, and with her it's even more difficult because her mode of cognitive processing is overwhelmingly emotional, rather than analytical.

so if not a calm and rational discussion, then what? i have no idea. i do know that it would have to be an emotional route; it's just that i have no idea of what it would look like.

i know i have spoken more about my situation than yours, but my hope is that you might be able to find some parallels here.

in either case, do know once again that i empathize with where you find yourself, and it is painful to imagine your dilemma.

i am here to listen and discuss--today, a week from now, and hopefully even months from now, whenever you want someone to listen.

all the best, and hugs."

sorry to hear about your mom's behaviour. 

regarding your mom, it appears to me that there is nothing you can do directly in dealing with her. the only route would be for her to accept treatment/therapy, but of course, she would have to be the one taking the initiative there. 

outside of that, the only option seems to be for you to keep reaching out to your siblings and show them that they can still trust you.

the first question is excellent. i don't have any facts or opinions to offer here, but I do have an entirely theoretical and logical argument to propose. for this reason, let's not discuss Trump here, and instead consider some hypothetical person called Alex. if Alex is a dishonest and a conman, then he might just be interested in replacing some claimed facts (biased or not) with his own self-serving lies. what would make it even more devious is if Alex is aware that many people distrust the msm, so he can gain their trust by appealing to their distrust.

regarding the second question, it appears that DNC's games are now widely recognized, and no major voice really disputes what happened. Some of the notable people who have clearly stated that DNC rigged the nomination are Elizabeth Warren, Donna Brazile and Noam Chomsky. And there's of course the leaked emails as well. I read somewhere that DNC's mishandling of the primaries was also addressed in court, and DNC admitted to it, but I could easily be wrong here.

india,fa0dhbm,t3_e7jcui,1575753284.0,"hey

identifying that you have a mental health issue is already a big step, so congratulations on reaching here. 

I don't have anxiety, but i've closely known many people who do, and i've dealt with other mental illnesses myself. 

you'll need to start thinking of your anxiety/depression as any other illnesses that needs proper attention, treatment, management and changes in lifestyle.

have you considered meeting a mental health professional? 

have you visited subreddits for anxiety etc.?

have you read up about anxiety as a mental illness, and how it is treated? 

have you had your thyroid levels and vitamin levels tested? 

from what i've gathered, anxiety continues to get worse after adolescence if left untreated. 

here are some of the main lifestyle changes you should strongly consider: 

- exercise is super important, and probably the most important thing you can do to help anxiety/depression
- avoid prolonged exposure to stress, at work and in your personal life. stress is known to be highly corrosive to brain health.
- try to get good sleep
- avoid smoking, drinking, and even caffeine
- get at least 10-15 minutes of sunlight everyday
- eat healthy, and drink enough water
- consider doing mindfulness meditation. in my personal experience, many folks with anxiety find meditation to be counterproductive. if you've tried it, and find it counterproductive too, then i'd be glad to discuss this in further detail. meditation can be a life changer if you can get comfortable with it.
- avoid having a long commute to work, and try to be closer to nature, and avoid urban environments to the extent possible
- try yoga
- having a good social support system of family or friends, who are non-judgemental towards mental illness, is super important. even better if they are well-informed about the challenges you are facing, and what they can do to help you.

these are just some of the general pointers towards changes that are known to help

but these are no substitute for proper professional advice. a good diagnosis, followed by cognitive behavioral therapy, and possible medication, can work wonders! 

finally (and least importantly) you could try the ayurvedic herb ashvagandha. it may not help with anxiety directly, but it might just help a bit in being resilient to stress. its efficacy isn't conclusively established experimentally, but is generally regarded as safe. but still do your own research here, because herbal doesn't mean it is free of side-effects/interactions/etc.

mental illnesses are often highly complex ailments, and hence do not get solved with a single magic pill. hence you'll need to attack with a multitude of good things.

all the best!"
askscience,f9zuv9t,t1_f9vqgc0,1575745630.0,"good catch, about what OP's question could have additionally meant. most folks here are missing it, as did I, until I read your comment. 

we know that the redshifts are due to expansion because the farther away an object is, the more redshifted we find it to be. further, the relationship between the distance to an object, and the speed it is receding at (as determined from the amount of redshift), is linear.

expansion is the simplest explanation here because if each unit volume in the universe is expanding at roughly the same rate, then something that is 2000 length units away from you would recede twice as fast from you than something that is 1000 length units from you, because there's twice as much space contributing to the total expansion between you and the object. 

this is where the old example of an inflating balloon helps. take a balloon, and use a sharpie to mark many dots on its surface. now as you start filling up the balloon, then you'd find that each unit area of the balloon's surface is expanding at a roughly similar rate. however, you'll also find that the speed of separation between any pair of dots turns out to be proportional to (i.e. a linear multiple of) the distance between them. 

does that make sense? 

🎈

PS: upon closely reading OP's question again, it seems that they weren't asking about the reason for redshifting after all. oh well, in either case, yours was a good question too."

bernieblindness,f9jyoxe,t1_f9jxzhu,1575388912.0,"yeah, I get that the numbers under the ""Difference"" column are (polling average - coverage share) / polling average * 100

whereas mine was polling average / coverage share * 100, as reflected by the numbers I posted in the headline. (eg 800% vs 655% for Bloomberg) 

I thought the direct ratio was a little easier to interpret."
tulsi,f96whnl,t1_f95thqc,1575153685.0,fair enough.
tulsi,f95a1lq,t1_f94f3l5,1575122987.0,"> Yang offers creativity but little else

policy-wise, yes. 

on the other hand the common thing between Tulsi, Yang, and Bernie (and Ron Paul, Mike Gravel) is their authenticity, actually caring for the well-being of the populace, and not kowtowing to the existing powers. Ana Kasparian was mentioning on TYT that apparently all the current Democratic candidates have paid Obama a visit, to ""seek advice"", but basically to kiss the ring. All, except Tulsi and Yang. these guys are walking on their own paths."

@CullenYossarian:

> #DNC Rejects @BostonGlobe Poll

> Poll has @TulsiGabbard at 6% MANCHESTER, N.H. — Without explanation or reasoning, the @DNC has refused to recognize the latest @Suffolk_U University Poll from the Boston Globe, which has Representative Tulsi Gabbard at 6%. #Tulsi2020

> @TulsiGabbard needs one more poll at 4% in order to qualify for the December debate, & this poll would have assured her of a place at the debate. The @DNC has recognized the Suffolk University pollster as a qualifying polling firm when they carried out a poll for @USATODAY

> But, without explanation, the @DNC refuses to recognize the exact same pollster for #NewHampshire. The @BostonGlobe is one of New Hampshire’s largest circulation newspapers and for the #DNC to ignore the Boston Globe as a media outlet ignores the people of New Hampshire.

> @TulsiGabbard’s campaign responded to the @DNC’s refusal to recognize the Poll: “This is another example of the DNC being arbitrary & inconsistent. #NewHampshire is the first in the nation presidential primary, but the #DNC has not shown its voters the respect they deserve.”"

india,f901at3,t3_e2utp0,1574967113.0,"how did you find out about the conductor who dropped him? 

would it be possible to locate the conductor and bus driver? the bus driver may have a better memory of where he stopped, since his attention was on the road. could even be worth actually traveling on that route with the same driver, as it may help rejig his memory. 

anyway, the likeliest location might be a village close to the highway between these two cities, and you could visit those places, ask around, place posters, and announce a prize. 

i'm aware that this is a very time and effort intensive approach, but it also takes you directly to the places where he most likely may be."

DecidingToBeBetter,f8tus2h,t3_e22obr,1574811732.0,"this may not fit in perfectly with your question, as it is less of a goal than a simple habit.

a super-duper simple thing to try is to drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up in the morning. BAM, that's it! 

you could make it even more convenient (for the morning) by keeping water at your bedside before sleeping. 

your body is somewhat dehydrated after sleep, so the water will you do you good anyway. 

but the beauty of this is that in the first minute of waking up, you feel like you've accomplished something. and because the effort needed is minimal, you actually look forward to checking off one item rather than dreading the effort to get started.

i struggle with ADHD and depression and my life can be depressingly disorganized and unstructured. when i came across this idea, i was able to stick with it for weeks, and each day began with a tiny but appreciable domino effect, which I was very thankful for. 

i don't know how appealing/useful this idea would be for someone who is neurotypical or somewhat organized (not assuming that you are neurotypical/organized), but when I was following this, i was in such a desperate situation to get something, anything, constructive and structured done, that even this tiny win was a big boost to my confidence, and it led me to then try out bigger things.

i think it is smart of you to seek out a keystone habit, and i wish you the best in finding yours! ✌"
