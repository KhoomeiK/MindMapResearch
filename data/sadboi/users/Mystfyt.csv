depression,ey7seqi,t3_cvy87x,1566898316.0,"I feel this so much even I don't want to think of it this way. When I am sad I am sad when I'm happy, for that moment, I am happy, it might not last long but that tiny moment I try to think of it as happiness instead of distraction. I'm still trying though.
