ExNoContact,fqmker9,t3_gjn8vf,1589478900.0,"I'm sure he did care and his feelings for you were genuine for a time. I know it hurts, but some people deal with sad situations by trying to seek out new relationships, New scenes and bury their unreconciled, undealt emotional insecurities in order to move on. It's their coping mechanism. It's not a reflection of you, but it is where they are at, emotionally and mentally. Its a decision that he made, and he has to face  the consequences of his decision. A part of you is in him, and he has to  acknowledge that one day, but it doesn't mean you have to be together. (As we meet many people in our lives that have had an impact on us).
I was in a similar situation, and it's been six months now since I left my ex (infidelity reasons). But I have only just started to make peace with his mistake and his new gf, and started to accept things happened, I got hurt, but it's not like the times we had together were always bad, I'm thankful for the lessons this experience has brought me.
It will take time for you to heal, and explicitly putting him out of your mind and investing your energies into 'doing you', getting a hobby or spending more time with family or other mates is part of your healing process. Then one day you will look back, without resentment or anger and genuinely wish him well. It's probably true that he has his own hangups and insecurities, as we all do, but it is not your responsibility to figure him out. You don't have to analyse him or justify his behaviour. You are both adults and responsible over your own mental and emotional responsiveness. And owning this part of yourself, will improve your character to be a better partner in your next relationship.(Not that you were a bad partner, but we are always learning and improving in circumstances life throws at us, generally).
Don't worry about him for now, go out there and just focus on getting all the hugs and love you deserve from your family and friend support."
Christians,fpo8i1p,t3_gdyjqy,1588780209.0,"Wow, this sub Reddit escalated  😂 Many good points raised here. There was a recent post about the original word 'repent' (sorry I don't have a link to it). It seems to mean to have a change of mind, a turned heart to the Lord. And as someone has pointed out, repent out of love, it makes sense, its easier to change your mind to Jesus if you love Him. But how can you change your heart of you don't love him🤔 maybe that's when a person needs to be helped in learning how to love Jesus 😊. I.e. cue the proper shepherd to take care of the sheep in the light of God's word.

We are under the Covenant of grace, so the moment a person confesses and believes in their heart that Jesus is Lord, then he is saved. Eternal salvation! Of course, you may still sin because it is impossible to be perfect with our flesh still with us. But whenever the heart is turned to the Lord the veil is taken away! We can still come forward to the throne of grace, confess our sins and He is righteous to forgive!

Of course, the Lord is coming back and there will be the judgement of God on those who did not believe in Jesus. But isn't there also a judgement from the seat of Christ(as the lamb of God) upon His own children, i.e. the wide virgins vs. the foolish virgins in Matt 25. I am guessing the 10 virgins are believers, but only 5 were wise, in that they had enough oil in their lamps and were rewarded at the bridegroom's return(Jesus). The foolish believers did not have enough oil in their lamps, I think the oil is the development of their Christian faith. They will not be cast into the lake of fire (because they have been born-again, raised up in the ressurection of Christ, spirit is born of God and hence cannot be cast into the lake of fire, but are immature in their faith) but they have to endure the tribulation to mature in their faith. (The number of years you've been a Christian doesn't guarantee that your faith has developed to be mature, as I'm sure we all know a few believers who still need a bit of growth....but maybe I don't have the right to make that assessment 🤔)....Y'all probably have different takes on this...

There were some tense discussions here, but I pray the Lord has mercy on us posters, and be the peace in our hearts, to enlighten us more and more regarding His word (He never stops enlightening us), and strengthen us to keep peace with others. Let's not take things personally and just pray for each other, we can't change people.

But good reminder OP, let's be on the watchful, not fearful about world situations but looking forward to our Lord's return."

Christians,fpiepg6,t3_gc66ts,1588639379.0,"Great post! I especially appreciate how you differentiated the dispensation of grace vs dispensation of the law. It's hard to get rid of this concept that we are repenting because we broke a law or something. 
Does that mean in the following verse, that the reference to sinners is not directed to sins emphatically, but that the act of turning our hearts would result in our receiving forgiveness?

Luk 3:3 And he came into all the region surrounding the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,


I may need to read over it again prayerfully because it is quite technical. 😅 But I also liked how you explained the original Greek meaning behind the word repent, is just to have a change in mind, and in attitude I guess, to be more towards the Lord. Telling sinners to simply repent from sins is not enough to have a full turn, I guess we don't realise that when we preach the gospel, we are entreating people to have a turned heart to God, presenting God in a way that touches their hearts and refutes their religious concepts. Wow, good job..."
Christians,fpic40t,t3_gcyj9a,1588637864.0,"Sexual activities outside of marriage is a sin, and unfortunately has become a common practice even amongst members in many churches. 
But we have a solution to all the feelings and accusations of guilt - the blood of Christ.
If you genuinely repent of your past sins and confess to the Lord, He is righteous to forgive. And if you believe in what the blood stands for and represents, in its eternal efficacy, then you can tell Satan to go away and to stop condemning you, because the blood covers you, and your sin. Satan cannot attack the blood or dispute its power, even he has to honour it. But he can easily attack God's children, and put lies and his own thoughts into our heads.
1John 1:7, 9  ...But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.....

If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness...."

There are also several Bible or Christian classic literature reading groups that gather together regularly to read e.g. Andrew Murray, particular Bible books, Charles Spurgeon, watchman nee. I also try to contact some 'sheep', young ones and new ones in the Lord quite regularly to read chapters of the Bible together, to help them grow spiritually. We have a spirit that loves to take care of others and to share the spiritual truths, so you could contact some other members for fellowship and encouragement 😊
Everything's online now."
Christians,fpgfo3m,t3_gdah48,1588601754.0,"Hey buddy, 
Hang in there. I understand the anxiety of finding a lifelong companion, it is a worldwide phenomenon especially in many churches. The desire to find someone to match you, while they need not be perfect but at least caring and loving the Lord, is verrrryyy common in Christianity today.
The Lord knows who to match you up with, because He created you, He knows what He is doing, give Him your trust and He won't mismanage it. You're 21, so don't feel like you need to rush I to anything, there are alot of people out there who don't settle until later.
You may be sensitive but the Lord can be your strength, in times of rejection and struggle. Remember the Lord Jesus also faced rejection, physical and verbal abuse, etc... So out all the people you'll ever meet or have heard of, no one can really sympathise with your feeling as much as the Lord.
Don't be sacred, because you have a spirit of courage and sober mindedness. If you're dwelling in your fear, then you're trusting and standing in that emotion, instead of taking God's perception of the situation/person. If you allow your emotions to overwhelm you, or Color the whole situation/person a certain way then it will just be your own take of the situation. You cant really say how that other person felt, or what other deeper emotions were taking place in them, so just respect their decision. Also sometimes the Lord closes doors, for a reason.
When people reject you, don't take it personally, because it is a reflection of who they are and where they are at mentally, spiritually, emotionally.
You need someone who is ready to be with you, and mature enough to handle the ups and downs of a relationship. Relationships are hard, so we want to make sure that when it happens, it happens in God's way, God's timing and God's will. But keep praying about your marriage, because God really cares about this detail in your life, and He does love you and care about you."
Christians,fpgdplx,t3_gcwmx3,1588600570.0,"Hang in there buddy! The Lord is always with you. Now with covid19 , alot of Christians are in isolation, unable to meet together in the Lords name. Soon in a  sense , we are all seperated physically from each other. 
Now in a time like this, when we are on our own, it is a good opportunity to spend time in His presence, meditate on His word and pray for His will to be accomplished. Maybe you won't be seperated and be by yourself forever, so seek to understand what the  Lord wants to  gain in you in this season of your life.
Every detail of your living matters to the Lord, even practical human matters like family, friends, hobbies...as you meditate on His word, He will enlighten you on the way you spoke to a particular person (for example), or He will convict you about some habit that He wants you to let go of.
I feel like 80% of our Christian life is a hidden life, deep in the Lord, private from others viewing.
Of course, Im not saying that you shouldn't have fellowship with other Christians, because we are members of the Body of Christ, it's a matter of spiritual connectedness with others, should be a normal desire to have.
Also know that many Christian missionaries and famous classic Christian writers experienced depression and anxiety..e.g. Charles Spurgeon... It was their portion from the Lord, but out of their sorrow flowed a rich ministry,and many became believers
I guess just be aware, that the Lord is always, ALWAYS, working ...and the seasons and environments He puts us in, have a purpose.
Ultimately, we know that all things work out for our good, but we need to be responsible to do our part, by learning to continually turn to Him and seek Him,in all circumstances, or persons or whatever the sovereign arrangements are....then our Christian life will advance.
Practically, I think you could seek out Christian groups, that have online fellowship that you can actively participate in.
I hope that helps....stay the course, run the race, it's tough, but the Lord is always ready to supply superabundantly...i.e. when you ask Him for strength, He will give more than you ask, and there will even be a surplus..."

Teenage years are usually the years where you feel especially insecure or awkward. So don't feel too bad for some things you're not good at, in this season of your life.
Other social activities may also help you to practice your conversation skills a bit more, such as sports club, gaming club etc... Basically a gathering where you are just around people.
You could also volunteer in some charity, oftentimes junior volunteer roles will involve simple admin tasks where you are required to talk to people, so that might be good practice.

I am still working on my social awkwardness and shyness,and I am in my mid 20s. But I've definitely improved.  All the things I've mentioned above, I wish someone had told me when I was your age.
So don't over analyse your special 'quirks' too much, a majority of people out there are shy and socially awkward into old age, and sometimes having this commonality of shyness actually can bring people together, and make  them more comfortable being around people, ironically. You are actually pretty cool, and do have something to offer...Good luck!"

If your mind is foggy, you may need to figure out if it's a health problem and consider some lifestyle changes like diet and exercise.

I sort of understand what you mean about not feeling good enough,but if you keep judging yourself as slow, and shine a spotlight on your weaknesses i.e., you're awkward or too quiet, then it'll be hard for you to take a different perspective to change your situation. It'll be easier to stay in that negative mindset. 

The subtle art of not giving a f*** by Mark Manson is a great read, for helping to change your perspective on life, there is also a chapter in there about Failure is the way forward. He gives a story about Picasso, who embraced all his failures and pain points as it helped him perfect his art so well to the point that he could charge his art scribbles on a dirty napkin for $20,000 to someone who wanted it. I guess he treasured even his scribbles as a symbol of his accumulated failures and hard work. 

You can get free of your frustrations with yourself and your current situation by trying new things that will take you out of your comfort zone, and challenge you. You will fail, but you will learn, and you will grow and I'm sure you will not regret your attempts. Instead you will learn to respect yourself a bit more, and your develop overall as a better person.
