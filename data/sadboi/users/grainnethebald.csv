I think most drivers who dont bike don't understand that it is a lot more physically inconvenient for us to stop suddenly, and that quickly starting back up again in the middle of an intersection is hard, especially if you weren't expecting to come to a full stop. It's a human powered vehicle and we have far less protection than you.
