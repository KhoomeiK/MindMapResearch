But then he‚Äôll hangout and even vouch for people like Tana and Jeffree * ... ever since Shane and jeffree came public with their friendship and business partnership - jeffree has done some really shitty things. Like calling Jackie Aina a gorilla, and bullying James who is basically still a kid, and just basically showing that he hasn‚Äôt changed!(not to mention the stuff Tana has done). And I know it‚Äôs not Shane‚Äôs job to parent them or apologize for them but I‚Äôm a big believer in who you hang around is a huge indicator to who you really are. Jeffree has done bad things and I‚Äôm surprised Shane doesn‚Äôt distant himself if he really is that kind caring person he claims to be... it makes me think that Shane has a side to himself that no one really knows about...

A lot of times when dealing with anxiety we get these thoughts in our mind that a negative and then once we start thinking about it, it‚Äôs like we can‚Äôt stop & our thoughts will race until we eventually get an anxiety or panic attack. CBT therapist will help you change the way you think so that you don‚Äôt get those negative anxiety inducing thoughts, and also teach you how to stop your mind from racing. They do it with talk therapy and sometimes exposure therapy. Their are even books you can buy that will teach you how to do CBT therapy on yourself."

               -  If you had a brain tumor you would have constant headaches and your vision would be affected

No matter how much you hate them, whatever they did to you, at the end of the day they are still the mother/father of the child and shouldn‚Äôt be in the middle of everything."

AskReddit,f6g2jo3,t3_dr0zrb,1572821069.0,"In 1st grade my science teacher was teaching us basic hygiene rituals (like brushing your teeth 2-3 times a day, washing your hands after the restroom or when you come inside from the playground) I remember she told us that if we ever see someone come out to the restroom with out washing their hands to let her know because it was disgusting and could spread germs. 
So one day this girl in my class who was every teacher‚Äôs favorite (eye-roll) went to use the toilet and then came out with out washing her hands. So of course, just like the teacher told us to do, I went up to her and told her that the girl didn‚Äôt wash her hands. She said she would talk to her and I went back to my desk. Minutes later the girls comes back in the classroom crying and the teacher calls me out to the hallway to talk. I go out to the hallway and the teacher started getting after me for being nosy and a tattletale! I was so confused and reminded her that she instructed us to tell her if we ever saw anyone go to the restroom with out washing her hands. 
She then bends down to my eye level, got in my face and told me ‚Äúleave [girls name] alone and mind your business.‚Äù The teacher also told me that if I ever tattletaled again I would get paddled by the principal."
