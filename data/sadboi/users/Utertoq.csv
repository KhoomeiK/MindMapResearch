And maybe you live inside a cave, because all we see is a large part of the players, including pro players which are most of the time frustrated because the game is unbalanced.

An evidence is some video CWA released lately, which he explains that some artists inside supercell also do playtesting.

Xbow is so annoying that it reached the point that if u just give up the match on the begin, it's easier to win another 2 games afterwards than spending 6 minutes in this game and rising the cortisol level in your brain.

In my opinion xbow is an abomination to this game, it has a broken mechanics which seems like shouldn't be part of this game.

Of course xbow players have a lot of skill, they have trouble agaist some beatdown stuff, but the thing is that when you don't have a specific deck to counter xbow, you just lose if the xbow user follows the ""xbow script"". I don't want to sound offensive against xbow players, i have some friends that plays this deck, but i still think its a broken mechanic.

For sure it needs a rework in my opinion."
