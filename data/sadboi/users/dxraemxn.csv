I've even got a picture of a dead one in a piece of salmon. Unless you're buying sushi that isn't frozen for the FDA's  required amount of time to kill nematodes and tapeworms, there is nothing wrong with eating a piece of sushi. Every piece of salmon you have eaten, cooked or raw, has a 1/10 chance of having Anisakiasis worms in it. All of the parasites found in wild fish are killed by freezing below zero for 9 hours. 

As for heavy metals, I'm going to assume you're talking about mercury, in which case... what's your point? Whether from a grocery store, a skanky gas station or the most high class restaurant, it won't change the amount in what you eat. 

My Publix does freeze their fish, not sure about yours but I have personally talked to the staff and confirmed with them that the fish has been frozen before I eat it. I'm not going to eat something that isn't handled properly, have a little faith."

I hope it's one of those and not the motherboard itself, quite worried as Dell keeps telling me ""it's a software issue we will just reset the PC and send it back to you"" and I'm like... no... it's not... if it's crashing before it boots, no way it's software.

The system doesn't display any obvious RAM issues - it doesn't show less than is installed, it doesn't have graphical artifacts, nothing runs out of RAM, and the crashes before boot don't show artifacting across the screen - would I use memtest for this? I can do that, I have a USB and the malfunctioning port afaik is not the ones I would use for a USB

The only part of my PC that seems to exhibit any signs/issues of being wrong is the HDD, but it's 5400 RPM and I don't know how slow would be considered 'broken' or 'failing'. HDD is so slow it's like a turtle speed, sometimes it takes 15+ minutes to boot into Windows, it takes ages to open anything, it takes even the most light-weight games over 30 minutes to fully load meshes, textures, animations, and even the Dell SupportAssist took about 5 minutes just to open up. If I had to say how this occurred maybe it just got jostled during shipping. But I don't know that this indicates HDD problems, I'm not an expert on 5400 RPM. Everyone told me 5400 RPM is slow as molasses so I don't know"
