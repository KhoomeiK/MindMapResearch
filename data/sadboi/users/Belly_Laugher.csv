I don't doubt that he could very well be alive, either way, it's his planning that interests me the most.  I'd love to hear any speculation as to what would have been involved in preparation, execution, and end game.  Just spit balling here...

How much prep?  He would have needed an alternative ID if he ever wanted to make his plan go the distance.  Did he have an alternative vehicle waiting for him? Did he buy a bunch of seeds to live off the land and start a garden in the remote wilderness?  Cash?  Maybe just a duro motorcycle for him to make his way down to Mexico?  Or had he just scouted out a remote cave in the nearby wilderness.
