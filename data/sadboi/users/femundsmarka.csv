AmItheButtface,fr612ud,t1_fr32blt,1589918054.0,"hey, yes, let it sink a little bit, but if you want to adress it one more time, I want to advice against doing it in the last second. 

Most people have difficulties to change their behaviour  immediately after being critizised. I mean, you tell he goes off on you and we want to avoid that. 

Then don't do it shortly before. Sit down with him, tell him you want to talk, tell him that it makes you uncomfortable when it's all so injury prone and hasty. That you are slower and need to learn it properly first. Speed comes with experience. Tell him that you cherish his vast knowledge and (maybe?) enjoy to learn, but also want a pleasurable experience together. 

And then you tell him to PLEASE SLOW DOWN dad and please 'let's work together calmly'. Stress that it is very important to you. Try to make it an agreement as a father/daughter-team. 

If you don't think that he is naturally evil towards you, you want him to feel good about that talk, feel he came closer to his daughter and has a chance of further coming so. When he gets the feeling you want to be close to him and you will do sth bonding together,  staying calm comes with a reward and he will remember way easier.

Before you start, look him into the face and assure yourself, that he remembers. 

If he doesn't, then sadly my approach has failed.

You know him better and on most parts you have to rely on your own judgement, because we all can be completely wrong concerning your father.

I wish you good luck."

9 month are enough to fall in love and sometimes as you are still in the rosy tinted phase a break - up is really hard. 
Until now, we cannot know what it is, that keeps him distant, all we know something is. 

It has got nothing to do with your worth, that you are lovable. 

What is it, that is most unpleasant to you?"
BreakUp,fr48s13,t1_fr46l4x,1589879893.0,"We all know, when a partner wants to break up there is not much we can do. One problem is, people who do the break up often are in a turmoiled state, too. They often lack empathy and the change in their life, affects their ability of keeping a clear head and well controlled behaviour. It is pretty chicken to break up via phone and not give a clear cause. Although the thing about the clear cause often is, that they don't know it exactly themeselves at this point. It's more like a flight (also against the rubber band that still keeps you) for many.

So as you say, the bff is not the cause. What is it then, that you want, but he can't give you, is the question. And it seems to be something he is not comfortable to tell you.

And when you ask, he might snap on you, become angrily defensive and prefer to put you down, instead of confessing what he is so reserved to tell.

You are not very young anymore, right? You want a partner who is constantly keeping you updated about his feelings and state of mind, who integrates you. How long have you both been together?

I think the question that you want to answer yourself now is, whatever his reason is, do you think it is so important for you, that you want to risk he might hurt you in a talk? Do you believe in his character this much, that you think it is important for you to know and worth the risk? Or are there some secret reservations on your side, too and you maybe want to prefer to let it go.

Whatever you do. You need to be prepared for this talk. Now you are on the very short end. You have to be thankful if he talks to you at all, he sets the time, you have no control about what he will tell and more important: in what manner. You could easily be overrun.

Take your feelings serious, your family system might truly be like that, but talk about it in private to someone, who really supports you first, to find out in peace what is going on.

He didn't. 

I guess, people can get a grasp of your trouble. 
I personally do feel you hardened up a lot here, understandably, but this was not the right person and though difficult, it would have been time to let loose a bit towards her and made the effort to tell her in words,  how you feel about it and give her some basic respect. 
To be so disrespecting to a kid growing up, will cause trouble.
If really all you did was blocking and deleting comments,  a 12 year old, a 14 year old,...  and so on. And then it escalates, there is not much to wonder about.  Don't close your eyes about how hurting this is.  
Do you really consider flat out blocking as an appropriate way to deal with people close? 
A half sister will take notice of your existence and can't just be told to not have a desire to come closer to her siblings. We don't have that much info, but that could easily also be such a serious ongoing heartache. 
Maybe she was indoctrinated by your father, maybe it's both alltogether.

It is not her fault at all. Not. She is a victim of the situation as well as you. Cheaters underestimate the intergenerational damage they do. 

 Getting no reaction at all is quite cruel and very much a kick starter for obsessive behaviour.

You have to be a little bit aware of that some sort of sexual play isn\`t super uncommon between young children. I personally have only experienced with friends of same age and not in the family, but could at least imagine that some siblings have done similar. 

(It was only played intercourse or of course played ' being a family' and it wasn't real intercourse.)

Whatever you experienced what you experienced. 

I don\`t think, keeping it to yourself is the right choice. 

If she is aware of it and has to keep it to herself because of disbelief, shame, embarrasement  and taboo it makes her the victim again. And this time really. You don't know how disconnecting from other people that can be. This is were it can become really damaging!

Or maybe you know, because you now feel that disconnecting. Because you keep a secret of shame.

&#x200B;

How do we know? Because we can think of it ! That is why.  You can think of numbers that end at one point easily. It is what people learn first. 

Thus you can also think of numbers that don't ever end. 

&#x200B;

A bit other approach. If you see how numbers are build, e.g.:

127, 48 = 1x10² + 2x10\^1 + 7x 10\^0+ 4x 10\^-1 + 8x 10\^-2

= 1x100 + 2x10 + 7x1 + 4x 1/10 + 8x1/100

&#x200B;

It is coefficient x exponents of 10. 

 You pretty obviously see that you can expand numbers in both directions, right? You can think of numbers where you ' add sthh on the left side' like 2x1000 and you can add those 1/1000, 1/10000, ... 'on the right side'. 

&#x200B;

And our understanding is that only if you allow every exponent of 10 and every coefficient from 0 to 9 before it, we will 'meet' every possible number and we have something continous."

Oh, I disagree. There is a way back. It is not easy as a child, but it is better to solve that now, than killing the whole relationship. It is almost impossible to forget your parents.

And you are already quite old, so I think you could find proper words of what you want and what not.

This will make it easier for you, too, to have verbalized it instead of felling nebular hurt and neglect. You are 21 and can find words and demand things.

I suggest to find someone to help you find the words and the strength.

I've been at similar points, had a step sibling, were beaten without mother reacting and I would offer my help, but there are a lot of other people here, too, to give great advice.

Feel free.

&#x200B;

Strangely, I would say, to someone you like, you would never say in a cold way that he or she might die. That is always rude. Even if it is a fact, you have to be very gentle about the the death of a person you are talking to. Only, he was also unfriendly and rude before. Without any doubt. A real unsympath. Then violent in the end. This is something that is not negotiable at all. But I don´t think it is impossible to solve this with a talk on expectations from both sides.

You can make clear how much you disdain his way of talking about other peoples life. Make clear that you differ very much from him and don't appreciate his way. Yes, offer an excuse for the rudeness. He is old and he will not change significantly. And you don't really care about a relationship with him. It will be gone, the moment you move out.

And then demand that he will never ever slap you again and if he is not able to admit that this was wrong, think about escalation. But you don't have to tell him. I assume it is illegal where you live?

&#x200B;

And then talk to your mom. Explain her, that you need more support from her. That this was wrong and  hurting and if it isn\`t admitted damages your relationship.

Well, I think I could get more into detail, but I leave it at that. A rough path that could work.

Whatever you do. I wish you all the best and luck and joy.

Men are expected to be tough and insensitive. Their personalities get objectified and bodies neglected. Women are expected to be pretty at any price and live with the objectification of their bodies and neglection of personality and intellect.

Not twelve.
What I mean is you often don't know what happened before. You don't know the circumstances that led to distant or uncaring behaviour. People sometimes become mild as they age and when they are dependend. It is well possible that she wasn't a nice or good mother. 
And when caregivers like mothers are emotionally neglectant or some other kind of mistreatment, sometimes the heritage becomes a kind of substitute and a compensation. 

Why do I write this? Well I just find you paint the lady, yourself and the others pretty much  black and white. 
I find this a suspiciously light description of family dynamics. 
And you yourself might be a nice person, but after all you were paid for the care and changing the diapers. This all points to the fact that homes for the elderly are often underfinanced and it' s a shame and you maybe tried to compensate for that. 

Still if you are legally obliged to the heritage in your country, take the heritage. Than it's just the way it is.
