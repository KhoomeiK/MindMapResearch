Domestic small businesses would get free shipping out and in, as would consumers. 

International shipping would still have a cost. 

Think of it like this: Amazon is basically the website for the USPS we haven't got around to building.  Amazon leverages USPS and UPS to uphold it's business model, as they don't have their own infrastructure. We pay for USPS to run cheaply through taxes, so Amazon is basically slapping a search engine on an inventory software for a distribution network they do not own.


At the end of the day, any public digital marketplace we create would be competing with Amazon. It's a waste of time and energy. Yet we could use a public digital marketplace in this modern age. Gone are the days of catalogs and infomercials.  We just Google or amazon for everything. As such, amazon has dominated the 'storefront' of the digital market and obliterated all competition. 


It's kind of like if Walmart slapped the signs off of every business in the country and said: ""all business must go through us, and we will charge a toll tax"".  It's even more ridiculous than this, because for this analogy walmarts truck network would be a public utility we already pay for in taxes.  The Internet is basically the roads and rails of the information age. Roads are public. I have no idea why rails aren't. There's 0 reason the Internet shouldn't be. 


Amazon should be public, much like a farmers market is. Then small businesses across the country could use it as a digital storefront,  much like a farmers market. It would all be regulated for consumer and worker safety and operated at cost by the govt and funded by our taxes: freeing up people across the country to start small businesses with the nation readily available as a customer base.


If you've ever played runescape: it would be the grand exchange. Sorry if that's too nerdy haha.. but in  practice that's how it would function.


The benefits and boon to the people and the economy are enormous, and it removes private manipulators with no regard for human welfare like Jeff Bezos.


This is @yourWJB writing, on a different device.


It's a good idea, but the power of the richest man in the world is hard to combat when it comes to political viability. But I am of the opinion: no gods, no masters.
