Their numbers are completely out of control and there is nothing these poor farmers can do to keep them off of their crops. In keeping the numbers down, there is nothing more efficient than simply killing them. They are smart but fortunately, as a hunter, you know where to find them. If they learn to circumvent being hunted, then it's a slow process because they havent figured out not getting shot yet. Its not as much about their intelligence as it is their capability for fast reproduction.

Myself and everyone I know that hunt them eat what we kill and donate the rest to homeless shelters and people in need. The meat is absolutely amazing!"
AnimalsBeingBros,fox7me8,t1_fox6p9u,1588136091.0,My comment was more towards the pig but I completely agree with you about the dogs. If the dog meant business then there would be no question of it. I have two dogs of my own and they play-fight like spartans! Thanks for your input.
AnimalsBeingBros,fox5h23,t3_g9zs6a,1588134547.0,"I could absolutely be wrong but from my experience with wild boar (I hunt them to help farmers with population control), this doesnt seem all too friendly. It's a tuskless one and its making movements that are associated with goring the dog which could be instinctive. People also use dogs to hunt them which I consider inhumane and this dog isnt being the friendliest. Again, not an expert, just offering some first hand insight."

It's completely normal to not want to open up to your friends because who the hell wants to put them through what you went through. I get it. I've deployed three times and they were all pretty shitty too.

Bottom line if you need to seek immediate help. Talk to those that are trained to handle this in the most emergent times. Call your counselors emergency line or the vet crisis line if you need to. Youve opened up to us now you need to open up to the people who are paid to handle this and have the specialized training. Tell them exactly what you said here.

PM me if you need to talk. Ive been there. I know it fucking sucks. You have resources and it sounds like you already know that. Please use them or reach out to me or anyone else to get any additional ones."
