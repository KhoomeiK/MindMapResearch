gamedev,fqp0jnj,t1_fqoza5p,1589530732.0,"It's just that I find it easier to draw out the shape and extrude it than to actually have to learn how to sculpt a shape into something else. I'm also having issues with exporting fbx textures with it, seeing as how it simply won't export the textures anymore when I change even the smallest detail. I literally just started using Blender seriously within the past 24 hours, so I just don't wanna feel like everything I learned was useless. I make some beautiful work in AutoCAD, and I just don't wanna see any of it go to waste.

If it's the only choice I have then I might consider it, but I'm not fond of having to actually sculpt the shape due to not having that much precision with a mouse (I don't have touch pads or a stylus, or any of that fancy stuff, I just have a Surface Pro that I wanna replace with an actual gaming PC someday). I also wouldn't even know where to begin if I did decide to go that route."

If there's any way at all that I can continue to model in ACAD and just use Blender to add textures (and hopefully to reduce tri count if it does that) then I'd prefer to do things that way. The only reason I even care about tri count is because ROBLOX is strict about it, otherwise I'd just enjoy making the models and having them as digital art pieces."

3. If your god is real, and he is all powerful, all knowing, and all good, and if he actually values free will like they say, then why do people in I dunno... let's say North Korea, have no free will?
4. Evolution is a long and gradual process that takes millions and millions of years to see significant change, and while the attempt to strawman the argument is cute, it's an old cliche that can be debunked by saying (quite accurately) that nobody believes that humans are monkeys, but instead that we share a common ancestor.
5. Yes, those things are listed as forbidden in the Bible, as well as pork, ham, and bacon. Also, your religion sounds boring as fuck. While you fellate your god I'll be over here playing Pokemon and listening to Slayer.
6. Yes, there are millions of sects of thousands of religions, so how do you know yours is the correct one? The odds don't seem very in your favor, and considering they all say they're the right one and that nonbelievers suffer eternally in the afterlife, why believe in any of them without scientific proof (which you'll never get considering that religion is built solely on unfalsifiable (or more accurately untestable) claims)?
7. Yeah, if he exists and wants us to worship him all he has to do is reveal himself.
8. The question is actually, if God loves all his creations, and creates everyone in his image, then why would he create something solely to hate it? Also, since everyone is made in God's image, that means he's at least pansexual.

AsABlackMan,fniyyqs,t1_fnies6f,1586988880.0,"First off, America is a massive country the size of an entire continent, so making such a broad statement isn't the best idea. True, in many areas of the US, being LGB (and in some areas T, such as San Francisco or Seattle) is now seen as normal and perfectly valid. But that being said it really depends on where you are in the US. LGBT folk in the South and even in many areas of the Midwest risk being ostracized if they come out because a lot of those areas are extremely conservative.

Also, nobody's trying to separate themselves. The reason Pride is such a big thing is because there are still areas in the world where we are heavily marginalized and making our presence known can help many other LGBT folk realize they're not alone and come out, or even help to bring about massive social change in an area. There's also plenty of groups in the LGBT community who are still fighting for their rights to be respected and treated as human beings with rights (The trans community and all of its subsets being the perfect example)."

ptsd,fmas3m9,t1_fmam2ho,1585905604.0,"Thanks for reaching out. Right now I'm scared of sleeping in case the nightmares resume. They're always the same too. Either someone I love gets killed, or I end up being raped. I try to drown out the thoughts with fighting games, but the second I stop playing they come right back. I would also try alcohol, but that only seems to dull the edge as opposed to actually removing the arrow. I've heard the mantra ""this too shall pass"", but what that mantra doesn't take into account is that it shall also return, and with reinforcements. I know that there is a place I can someday get to which is better, but I just wish I had somewhere where I didn't have to constantly monitor my mental state. 

I only keep going because it would hurt my sister and brother if I didn't. They're the only ones I have. Hell, even fireworks can trigger me, and I've never been more than merely on an army base. I tell people my trauma is a seven layer dip of trauma. That's because my hell didn't end when I was 6. It just became a softer hell, then an abusive and bureaucratic one, then just a hell inside my head. Then add some near death trauma onto that (from a severe allergic reaction at that point), as well as being taken away from people you love 4 times and you've baked yourself quite the cake. I always keep up to date on what new cures or treatments are being developed. I've heard that psilocybin is being looked into as a potential solution, as is LSD, but I'm not the kind of person to just pop a bag of shrooms or a tab of acid and hope it works. I just wish there was a cure for this, because the thought of it killing me is a scary one. 

I know here in Minnesota CBD is perfectly legal, and they're introducing recreational legalization measures. I might try that. I know weed does help me cope and deal with the pressure easier. It's not even the nightmares or flashbacks themselves that really get to me anymore, it's the entire week or two after that destroys me. The aftershocks are the worst part, because I spend an entire week being extra sensitive to triggers and having extreme suicidal thoughts and ideations. I also hate the raging headaches I get afterwards too, but those at least go away after a few hours.

I am scared of the flashbacks, but that's because the next one is always worse than the last one. I've even grabbed a weapon during one of them. I just hate being constantly on guard, and I hate being so distrustful of everyone, but I can't exactly help it. I never had parents that understood my PTSD. They only really started to care when they saw it affecting me for themselves. Hell, I wasn't even taught many coping skills. I'm only just starting to learn that fists aren't the only way to solve problems. 

I just wish I had some help learning to cope with it as a child, and learning to become a better person than I grew into. I can't even properly engage in relationships involving sexual activity because I always feel nauseous afterwards. What makes everything even worse is that I don't have a therapist and am trying to get one."
