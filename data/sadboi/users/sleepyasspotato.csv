murakami,fhoyubo,t3_f49yqm,1581778153.0,After Dark was the novel that got me into reading Murakami. I recommend you read his short stories as well (Birthday Girl is my favorite). They're a nice break in between reading his novels. And they're all a pleasure to read. Anything of Murakami is :)

SuicideWatch,eul0lxw,t3_cgtqzs,1563895479.0,"Opening up to her must have taken guts to do. Contrary to what she said, you are not a coward. I don't believe that people who committed suicide are cowards either. It's just that they lost all hope and therefore succumb to the Way Out of it all. 

I, too, have felt the urge (am still feeling it from time to time actually) to end it all because I don't want to hurt anymore. But I mustered up the courage to open up first to my mother. Her response was more or less the same as yours. It hurt me. But I thought to myself that maybe she's just shocked, maybe she does not know how to react to your circumstance. My mother was like that. It got better though--she never fully understood but she accepted me and what I was going through. I hope it will be the same for you.

That said, hang in there, OP. I still have my worse days but I do my best to keep my head above the water. Hang in there."

depression,euh7hka,t3_cg9su5,1563822189.0,"Same here. I barely sleep at night because of constantly thinking about everything. It's exhausting. I suggest having a journal to write the things you keep thinking about so that there will be a tangible representation of your thoughts and they're not just randomly swirling in your brain. I label mine with ""Things I Constantly Worry About"" and I write even the most petty things. It makes me feel a little bit better knowing that my thoughts are in another place--in my journal, on the nightstand--other than my head."
depression,etu64ga,t3_cd6d58,1563205183.0,"I can relate. And it sucks. On my highs, I get so pumped up to do things, so I make plans and schedule stuff and list everything I want to do. I am actually hopeful and optimistic (made too much). But it will eventually die down after hours (or minutes) then I am left feeling empty again and I'll crawl back in my bed to do nothing. Then I'll feel guilty for doing nothing and shame myself for how much of a loser I am. 

It's like life is playing a perpetual game on me where it gives me hope and takes it back as soon as I get it. I always feel like life is mocking me."
