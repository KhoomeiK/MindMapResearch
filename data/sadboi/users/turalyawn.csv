If Canada turns into a violent hellscape we can always arm everyone but that's not going to happen. Your right to possession of instruments of death does not outweigh another Canadians right to life, period, and I applaud Trudeau for finally getting a good start on his election process and ridding this country of weapons that never should have been legal.

But again, to be clear, read just the first few paragraphs, homicide rates are down in Australia, not flat or rising. And the % of people in Aus that support loosening gun control is 7. 7%. So they're either 93% retarded sheep or it's working for them.

Any link between gun control and an uptick in assault is tenuous at best. And either way, assault is far less damaging to our society than mass shootings are.

Gun violence declined 77% in Australia in the 10 years after the ban, and only 7% of Australians favour loosening gun laws.

This is a good time to both take away dangerous weapons that are legally obtained in the past and increase punishments for those who smuggle and possess illegal firearms. If you're seriously arguing that legal gun owners' rights trump the lives of those affected by dipshits like this loser in Nova Scotia, then there's nothing to talk about. You're wrong, and I'm glad the government is coming to take your weapons.

And even then, many of those are fluent in one of many hybrid dialects that are considered improper or even destructive by the authorities that dictate proper French language usage.
