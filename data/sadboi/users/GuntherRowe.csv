In a short time, the USAF no longer had to do anything because the UFO mythology was self sustaining. It also helps them avoid accountability at Area 51.

It easily could be argued the entire series is a meta fiction. After all, King even makes himself a character and touches on or incorporates characters and parts of his major works. However, the last volume fails for me even as a meta fiction. Battles that are over off book and the it’s-not-the-destination-it’s-the-journey ending is just a cop out. Find a way to say what you want about your work and fiction within the conventions of the genre. After all, that’s what King does for much of the series. King is a great, very successful novelist, but sometimes I think he needs a tough editor. His publisher doesn’t give him one because they don’t need to commercially. They’ll make money no matter what. Finally, I like five of the seven books. There’s lots to love. Write one book and the ending sucks, I can shrug and walk away.

You've got to be taught from ‘South Pacific’

To hate
And fear
You've got to be taught
From year
To year
Its got to
Be drummed in your dear little ear
You've got to
Be carefully
Taught
You've got to be taught
To be
Afraid
Of people
Who's eyes are oddly made
And people who's skin is a different shade
You've got to
Be carefuly
Taught
You've got to be taught
Before it's too late
Before you are six
Or seven
Or eight
To hate all the people
Your relatives hate
You've got to
Be carefully taught
You've got to
Be carefully taught

Emile De Beque -
This is just the kind of ugliness I was running away from
It has followed my all this way

All these years
And now it has found me
I was cheated before
And i'm cheated again
By a mean little world
Full of mean little men
And the one chance for me
Is this life I know best
To be here on an island
And to hell with
The rest
I'll cling
To this island
Like a tree or a stone
I'll cling to this island and be free
And
Alone
