I also got in working on the Nintendo Switch. First, I had to create a Switch account, for each account. Second, I had to create a Microsoft account, for each account. Third allow all privacy settings on both the Switch / Microsoft account. Then I had to go into the switch, and connect the Switch / Microsoft account to the profile on the system itself. If you're having troubles reset the login information in the Minecraft settings menu. After that reconnect using the [https://login.live.com/oauth20\_remoteconnect.srf](https://login.live.com/oauth20_remoteconnect.srf) link. Make sure to login to the right account; that was my first problem. My second problem was I was impatient, and assumed the system wasn't responding rather when you enter the code on that link you HAVE to WAIT a few minutes sometimes and the code that appears on the switch will disappear, and show your connected Microsoft profile. If you don't wait, and are impatient like I am it will result in not connecting properly. If this happens you have to press the menu button on the switch, cancel out of Minecraft completely as it can't be running in the background - go to the profile, and clear the login information - reconnect the account using the remote connect link above. WAIT, be patient once you enter that number at that link. Anytime you're having trouble you may have to redo this process. The kids come up to me every day, or two and ask me to fix it. I'm unsure if it's disconnecting, or if the kids are being IMPATIENT!!!"

As far as minorities my family is full of them. Blacks, whites, asians, gays, trans, bipolar, schizophrenics, military, deaf, mentally challanged, etc. My family is diverse and I speak on experience not because someone told me to think a certain way but because I've observed and come to my own conclusion to treat people based off merit. I don't need to offer respect to anyone it is a choice. If you're a piece of shit I'll treat you like one. If you're genuine I'll eat off the same plate as you. Simple as that. 

So far the trans community has done an excellent job of making a fool of themselves; maybe a minority of the trans community because I do not know many. As far as people calling me names or not calling me what I like I truly dont give a shit. I stopped worrying about that stuff when I realized people will always find a way to hate or like you no matter who you are. It's not my business to care what you think or call me. It's my business to worry about me and those in my circle because that's what matters. If people can't understand that then there is no need for further conversation and I'll cut you off quick and continue on with life like you never existed and we've never crossed paths.

Even with surgery at this point in out history it still isn't fully possible. Let's not even mention the biological differences in this conversation. That arguement that you provided is severely flawed - all based on feeling.

You're right it's not about me because I'm more than capable of taking care of myself and have no problem making stuff happen if things go down. It's about my wife and kids and their saftey not to mention the other kids around and women around me on a day to day basis. My job is to protect.

If I see a dude who identifies as female and trys to gain access to a females bathroom you're going to have issues. Simple as that. There is no room for arguing here. You've been given more comfortable options for going to the bathroom.

The trans community feels as though they are being attack by every stright member of society who opposes their fucked up policies. A community where feelings are facts and facts established by science are not. We (stright community) don't agree with you so we must be transphobic is the theme of the trans game here which is complete bullshit

Fuck out of here with that shit. Respect is a two way street. Respect my wife and kids personal space and I'll respect your wishes to rearrange you appendages and call you by your said ""gender"". I have said this a million times and I'll keep saying it you can have a lockable bathroom, a trans bathroom but you are not welcome into the opposite genders bathrooms. I would not invite someone into my home, to sleep in the same room as my child, to take a shit in the same room my child is showering, etc - no matter how much I know and trust the person. I don't even let anyone watch my kids and my schedule is based off my children constantly having contact with one or the other parent unless it's for school and in sight of many of people.

Not to mention the fact that I have one trans male to female in the family and a half a dozen or so gay people in the family. They are treated with complete respect. Why? Because they know their lines of respect on both sides of the arguement. Respect my wishes and I'll respect yours; that's the goal is it not?"
