You probably will be able to easily kill tier 1s and 2s of each boss, and probably t3 Revanent if your combat level is okay. Some essentials to get are Maddox batphone, radiant power orb, and all of the talismans possible that you can. Revanent armor isn‚Äôt really necessary for fighting tier 4s, most people use superior. Do not get armor of the pack for wolf, mastiff is very good though in combination with shaman (which is upgraded to pooch). Tarantula armor is really good but you should probably farm kills on your island using spider minions. Keep in mind for sword recluse fang is not very good, aotd is better until scorpion foil. You should have different armor for different slayer.

Then look though collections for easy talismans. Adventurer merxhant sells some and wheat, obsidian, emerald, sugar cane, and potato(?) have cheap talisman. Reforge them to godly, zealous, or shiny if they‚Äôre common, and godly or zealous if uncommon+. People might tell you need itchy. They‚Äôre wrong, you need crit change high first. 

Next, get a raiders axe. You can buy one for ~130,000 coins but on auction house you can get it for cheaper or buy an enchanted one for a bit more expensive. Just make sure it has sharpness on it and not smite. Important enchantments are sharpness, critical, scavenger, first strike, and giant killer but most are good (except for knockback and fire aspect) 

You‚Äôre gonna want to finish your ender armor and reforge it all to godly or unpleasant (if you need the crit chance) zealous is ok for if you don‚Äôt have a lot of coins. 

With this you should be able to one shot the top endermen, get a grappling hook in string collection and start hitting endermen. You should get pretty easy coins and you can sell the pearls. 

One more thing. Minion slots are crucial, you get more by crafting minion tiers you haven‚Äôt crafted yet. Ideally you get materials to make all of them to tier 1 (except for flower, revenant, and tarantula) or you might have to buy tier 1 minions from other players. Try to place a variety of minions to start and for the love of Stalin, diamond minions are as good as others. (Get the compactor upgrade too)(cobble collection)
