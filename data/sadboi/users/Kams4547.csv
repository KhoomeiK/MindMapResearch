1, talk to your mom, be thrutful and use empathy.   Constantly talk to her about how it is normal to go out and you should be able too. Tell her when and where you are going, she likes to know.
2, Not recommended but you can be harsh about it with her, be mad with her, show her how annoying she is about not letting you go out
3, not recommended either, you can lie to her, tell her you are going out with a female friend, do it when she is not here, tell her you are staying after school with a club...

What I have been doing to counter this is to prepare something in advance, obliged myself to have to wake up to go hang around with friends and play Pokemon Go, It keeps me distracted and while I am doing something I can feel fine until I just go back home alone in my room, supposed to do homework but then sit down and start thinking again, I don't even know if I really have depression although I am pretty sure I do.
