euphoria,ey9e9bu,t3_ctxt7n,1566941336.0,"Obviously it’s not for children but I think the show is pretty good at portraying the down sides of all those unhealthy coping mechanism. 
It’s not romanticising drug use like other shows, more so it shows how it affects you and the people around you in a warning kind of way. 
Same goes for the portrayal of sex and relationships. It shows the dangers of getting pregnant, catfished and even blackmailed."
euphoria,ey9dgep,t1_exncan8,1566940816.0,"Is that because you dislike the character of Nate? Then I think it’s a fucking great job by the actor that he makes us hate this Charakter so much. And on top of that he still manages to show glimpses of emotion behind his actions and his rage.
You may not like the character but the actors portrayal was incredible!"
euphoria,ey98xmn,t3_cunbfg,1566937879.0,"I‘m not from America but growing up I also always thought such portrayals of growing up as in skins or on euphoria we’re all fake. However I’m 3 years outta school and looking back it was scary accurate. I’ve had several friends die of ODs. Some are on methadone. I myself was in a closed psychiatric ward, tried every drug I could get my hands on. A friend killed herself. A girl threatened to burn down her bfs house. Leaked nudes of 14yo. Wild rumours everywhere.
What I was trying to say you often even don’t see things like that going on if you’re not close to those people or in their circle of friends.
I found out a guy I went to class with was shooting h half the time like a year ago."
euphoria,ey96vjw,t3_cnx5ot,1566936568.0,"I certainly think rue overdosed since it all build up to it with that song. The melody was sprinkled throughout the show whenever she felt tempted to do drugs.  I just love the show for how they did that.
However I think the light she was looking up to was someone reanimating her and she fell into the light. She left the happy memory with her father to go into this dark street and stay alive.

Another rather crazy theory is that rue is in a coma.. I mean she said if she could she would stay there forever. Maybe she is staying in one and jules and lexi fill her in one everything that happened and that’s why she knows all those things. Idk it’s rather stupid I guess."

I'm so happy to read about people getting better and becoming more balanced and healthy. 

Thank you for sharing this!"
CasualConversation,evff8qq,t1_evf15ve,1564494745.0,Thank you for sharing. And congratulations on getting better!
CasualConversation,evf7jvk,t1_evf1z18,1564490499.0,"Thank you for your response! 

I thought like that for a long time, too. A lot of people and therapists say that bpd is not treatable and I just accepted it. That's why I maybe waited a bit too long, too. 

Getting help and starting to get better is a succes in itself I'd say, so congrats on that and the progress you've already made! Keep it up!

And thank you for your kind words! I will save this for when I feel down to remind myself that it's possible even though it will be hard."
CasualConversation,evf6n6r,t1_evf1pbv,1564489877.0,"Thank you for your response. 

> Learning to cope in a way where you no longer think about coping, it's just automatic. 

This is what I'm hoping for. Just your overall description of your life nowadays is so incredibly motivating to me. I always thought of bpd to be untreatable as many seem to say that it is but it's so amazing and reliving to see that with a lot of work it can get better.. Congrats on making it! 

This is exactly what I needed to hear, thank you so so much!! I have already written down all the reasons why I want to get better for when I'll feel down and I'm gonna add this post to that list. Thank you!"

unpopularopinion,evc8lw3,t1_evc7azm,1564409245.0,"I'm not saying they don't care. Maybe they even care too much. 
I really don't want to generalize this but some people want to see you get better so much that they stop listening to you and instead try to fix you. Then they get frustrated when it doesn't work and leave. Caring in this case is just accepting that you can't fix them and instead just be there."
unpopularopinion,evc68jz,t1_evc0xtf,1564407451.0,"I totally agree with you one the last part but I think cutting someone off should be the very last option. 

I myself have mistaken friends for therapists before and I know that this won't end well for either one involved (and that it's just plain wrong) but I do think talking about it could have helped. However if the mentally ill person isn't willing to get professional help and to respect your boundaries cutting them off is the only way to go."
unpopularopinion,evc5fuf,t1_evbul9h,1564406823.0,"Them not knowing how to help isn't the issue. They're not supposed to ""fix"" me I've got to figure that one out on my own/in therapy. 

Them leaving or acting surprised/annoyed when you start showing symptoms is an issue however.

And I can see how people would want to help their friends if they see them suffer but this ain't their job and they can help so much more by just being a friend instead of trying to be a therapist."
unpopularopinion,evc4q80,t3_cj5w7w,1564406246.0,"One of the worst things is warning people about your symptoms and how bad it can get just for them to say ""You're not as bad as you see yourself."" and then leave when it get's bad."

Also I often envy people because I feel like I'm missing out on so many things because of my mental illness. It fucked up my teenage years, now I'm in my twenties and trying to keep my distance to people so I won't get hurt and hiding at home not doing anything valuable due to depression result in me missing out on so many things once again."
Drugs,evakfyr,t1_evafjjh,1564350012.0,"Thinking about what you said I'm realising that it's probably not drug related at all. 

I envy them for apparently being happy. I got into drugs because of mental health issues and wished so many times to be a basic boring person just to not feel this way. That's probably the problem. I just never saw the connection between those things.

I'm literally sitting here baffled by this realisation. Thank you for your response!"
Advice,eva0b6b,t3_ciw3r4,1564335654.0,"Why shouldn't it be appropriate? You knew her, she was a part of your life, you were part of hers. If the parents think of you and invite you I don't see a reason why you shouldn't go.

And I'm so sorry for your loss. It's so sad to see people so young give up hope."

Advice,ev9xhre,t3_civz5q,1564333692.0,"I can't advice you anything that hasn't been said yet but I just wanted to tell you your friends probably would be more than happy to help you.

Talk to their parents. Neither your friends nor their parents (if they're in their right mind) would want to see you suffer in an abusive household. You're not being a burden!"
BPD,ev97d8f,t1_ev6twfi,1564310099.0,"For him it's the smartest thing he could do. It's healthy and in the long run I would've probably took a toll on him. Also this made me get professional help so it's kinda good for me too I guess. Still it hurts and I miss him so fucking much. Like I really want to share all those things with him but I can't.
That's quite accurate, I used a similar phrasing when explaining something like this to my friends. They would always get confused when I kept saying ""my brain wants me to do this or that"" but explaining it like I'm sitting on the passenger seat while someone else has control really helped."
BPD,ev5a9gk,t1_euzsohv,1564230394.0,"This is gonna be quite long, I'm sorry..

I don't want to be negative in any way.. I really hope this works out for you two and that he really is getting help! I think he needs to realise the same things I did to get better...

I always thought as long as people make allowances for me it'll work out. It made things a lot easier for me but in the long run this wouldn't have worked out. Whenever those people that I have set up ""rules""(i.e. if you're busy just tell me you're gonna text me back the next day/week) for would break those I would lose my mind. ""How can they act like this knowing what's it gonna do to me??"" Well sometimes people are selfish even though they love you. Their mind can't resolve around you 24/7 and sometimes they'll just forget stuff or why it's important to you. But for me it would lead to a mental breakdown.

I've had a fight because of something like this with my fp, lost him and had to have a talk with my crying best friend telling me she can't be responsible for my suicidal ass just to realise that this will happen again and again if I don't change my way of thinking and coping. It's not the people around me that have to change, it's me. And yes of course it's great if people are caring, understanding and supportive but we can't just rely on that. People can only be supportive to a certain point. We have to want to get better and seek help and then we can be the amazing person our family and friends deserve.

Like I said I really really do hope he is getting help now and that it doesn't take him losing you to realise this. It seems like it's quite hard to get through to him or talk to him about all of this but maybe you could sit down and carefully talk about all this? How you love him and just really want him to get better so he won't suffer that much? Idk how to talk to people with bpd because I can see myself misunderstanding everything I just said."
BPD,ev56bfd,t1_ev1hdqj,1564228367.0,"Weed and drugs in general may be an escape from our thoughts or in other ways a help to deal with our problems. I cannot give you any advice but if anyone ever asks me if they should start or do more I'll always say no. 

They don't help in the long run. I myself started smoking a lot more over the last couple weeks and even though in my case it helps silence my thoughts a bit, they don't go away.

I don't know if you've got a therapist or if you've got access to one, but I think they are the only ones that can help in the long run. It's gonna be a long way with a lot of work ahead, but drugs are essentially just a way to cope. Without working on the underlying problems, I don't think they'll solve anything."
BPD,ev55a46,t1_ev3kiyt,1564227855.0,"This describes it so well, wow! 

Afterwards I can always see my ridiculous behaviour as what it really was but in that moment it's like my feelings and my thoughts are drowning out every attempt to form a reasonable thought."
BPD,ev54o03,t1_ev0xcte,1564227528.0,"Totally me right now. My fp went nc after a fight and me being fucking overdramatic even though I couldn't help myself in that moment. I could literally feel him losing interest in me more with every second and everything I did made it worse.

And now it's all over and I can't even apologise and tell him I've come to my senses and finally reached out for help. It sucks, but eventually we'll get over it I guess."
BPD,ev547u6,t3_chiutj,1564227284.0,"DAE feel so frustrated with themselves for being like this, that you get annoyed by other people that are also suffering? 

Like getting angry at posts that you think are excusing this behaviour or not working on it because you just want it to change so badly but don't know how?"

BPD,eudvwz3,t3_cfy198,1563728868.0,"I know exactly how you feel. 

For me being self aware also comes with this false feeling of self-control. Like I'd be thinking I've got it all under control, I'm not acting out, everything's working out fine until I'll notice I've made all the same mistakes again without realising and am worse off than before just because I kept thinking I would notice if things started getting worse again.."
BPD,eu0ulsl,t1_eu0eji2,1563355236.0,"Oh I see now that this came across incorrectly. He never said something about killing himself, he said he wouldn't want to be around if I did it. That's why I don't get why he'd get so mad at me for saying something like that."
BPD,eu0bjoq,t1_etyeb4y,1563345087.0,"It’s not like those were threats in any kind. He knew i thought about suicide quite a lot and that it gets worse when i feel abandoned. But I never said I’m gonna kill myself I just told him it’s gonna happen some day if we keep things up like this and he wouldn’t want to be around for that.
I just feel like he didn’t have the balls to tell me he wanted to end things and now I’m the crazy one whose fault it was."
BPD,eu0a8vw,t1_etxwqf3,1563344447.0,"Partly yeah but he had promised to never just leave like this. He promised we would always talk things out.
I just don’t understand how everything went to shit this fast."
