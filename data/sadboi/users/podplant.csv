OCPoetry,fg487j0,t3_ewo6jm,1580498216.0,"For my feedback on this one, I‚Äôd like to just tell you how I interpreted it, and you can do with this what you will. 

This poem to me sounds like an imagining of the death of the universe. ‚ÄúTriangular foundation dismantles‚Äù‚Äîtriangles are the strongest structure, and could even be considered the ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù of all other structures. The poem opens with the strongest shape breaking. The subsequent fragment sentences reinforce the idea of ‚Äúdoom‚Äù or ultimate destruction (things breaking into fragments). The ‚ÄúTrumpets‚Äù sound like a reference to the Biblical Trumpets that will sound at the end of the world. You close out the poem by exploding one of the smallest particles, a quark, and imploding the world, a nice juxtaposition which I feel reinforces the chaotic image you‚Äôre creating. 

I dunno, I feel like the chaos of this poem is a nice word-painting for the scene you‚Äôre trying to depict (doom or destruction). It worked for me. There were parts that didn‚Äôt make sense to me, like your use of ‚Äúexample‚Äù as a verb in line 6, or the entirety of line 7. But I‚Äôm just choosing to interpret those things as part of the general chaos of the scene you‚Äôre creating. If you‚Äôre painting a chaotic scene and your medium is words, it would make sense to make some of the words not make sense.

Now my brain hurts a little bit, lol."
OCPoetry,fg45epn,t1_fg3v7de,1580496524.0,"One thing I noticed was that the last line actually rhymes with the title. In light of that, I thought it actually ended quite nicely."
OCPoetry,fg3pmkb,t1_fg3gqip,1580486949.0,"Yeah, no, I totally got that description. I played with butterflies as a kid and I always thought the tiny scales rubbing off their wings was like dust. I wouldn‚Äôt change that comparison. I actually thought it was really powerful. What I would change in the line ‚ÄúMy scales fall like dust to him‚Äù is your word choice of ‚Äúto him.‚Äù I feel like your prose could be a little more impactful with a different preposition than ‚Äúto‚Äù there. Toward, on, away, etc. Something a little less ambiguous than ‚Äúto.‚Äù Like I said, just a small nit-picky thing that kinda took me out of the poem when I read it."
OCPoetry,fg2race,t3_ewizgb,1580452743.0,"Hey so, first of all, I like the concept a lot, and i think, in its current form, it‚Äôs a really beautiful poem. However, the thing that struck me was the narrator. You‚Äôre writing from the perspective of a butterfly, but the butterfly seems to have the same knowledge of the situation as you do. It knows it has been caught with a net, is aware of what mesh is. You might consider reworking it so that there is a little bit more unreliable-ness to your narrators voice. Have the butterfly relate what it is experiencing to specifically things it has experienced. In this vein, I think when it described itself as reduced to a ‚Äúflightless lump‚Äù worked really well, because in my mind that made me think of it as feeling reduced to a caterpillar. There were some implications of humiliation there. So yeah, maybe focus in more on the butterfly‚Äôs perspective specifically as a butterfly‚Äôs perspective. Not as a human seeing things from a butterfly‚Äôs perspective.

I also have one nit-picky thing. The wording in the line ‚Äúmy scales fall like dust to him.‚Äù Why specifically TO him? That feels a little unclear or stilted. It could mean that the dust fell TOWARDS him, or that to HIM, it was like dust. If you wanted that ambiguity there, great. If not, consider changing your preposition ‚Äúto‚Äù to something more direct.

All in all, though, I enjoyed it. Keep up the good work!"
OCPoetry,fg2p8ws,t3_ewa0yc,1580450644.0,"ok, i really liked this one. after my second read thru, i can‚Äôt get over the first image of chilling in a bath tub, so nonchalant despite a ghost flickering the lights. your word choice there makes it seem like the ghost is less of something paranormal and more indicative of your frustrations with the tendency for people to poorly communicate, especially from beyond the grave."
