FiddlesticksMains,fr1lttq,t1_fr17tkx,1589821964.0,"Agreed! Everyone here seems to think that Fiddlesticks is mindless, but that’s not what a demon is. Demons are clever, intelligent beings; and Fiddlesticks is also, *supposedly*, the first of them.

This said, there are some interesting characteristics. According to the lore, there was a *legend* of “of a great evil that has no form, no thoughts, and no understanding of the world it inhabits, instead building itself into the crude shape of those that fear it.” 

There are a few important details here. This *legend* is the best understanding of Fiddlesticks from those who know about him, not his actual description. Also, Fiddlesticks adapts, changes form. He studies those he plays with and grows from them. That is an absolute sign of intelligence. Just because he *supposedly* has no thoughts does not mean he cannot think. Again, he does consider the best form to terrify his prey, so he thinks to an extent.

For a demon, there are no dire needs. If he has a requirement to eat or feed, it’s easily within his power. All of Fiddlesticks’s necessities are met because he has the power to do so effortlessly. So what does his life become? A game, and it’s a game that he is naturally good at. He doesn’t need to think too much to win. He’s powerful and clever, and that’s all *his* game is about.

So is Fiddlesticks intelligent? Probably. He is one of the first beings of this world, he clearly learns from his prey; or at least learned. After all, he has achieved the embodiment of fear, according to the lore. He just has no need to think further. I think he’s like Shaco in the sense that **what he does is just fun, games and nothing more**."

Also what would pro players do? Each team would have a plan, and then you have a 5:5 vote, 1:1, which would either result in a random selection of two or seeing the same one every game if they voted the same.
