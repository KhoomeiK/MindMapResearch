dayton,fn6iz0c,t3_fzwsnz,1586700504.0,"All stores except for the Walmart on Miller lane, which no one should go to anyways, have pretty much everything. But it’s like every store has a different item or section they are out of more than the next store, so sometimes it helps to hit multiple different stores. However a delivery service or pick up service from meijer and Kroger are great, meijer seems to have it better for their employees than Kroger’s (my girlfriend works for meijer). If you need meat though or fresh produce and the stores don’t have a lot, the Mexican store on burkhardt hasn’t ran out of anything since the start of all this! 

Good luck and stay safe!"

You may have to resort to a meat grinder or blending of some sort if he absolutely refuses. Good luck!"

Have proof these things happened or texts saying it did, whatever. Keep you and your babes safe most of all. Think about the life your child will live with a father that has called him pussy since 1. Do this for your child over anything. You are strong and smart, it will be okay but now is the time to make moves!"

AmItheAsshole,fkne6q8,t3_fjjhl3,1584363349.0,"Yes for the love of god YES YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE. My father is an emotionless man raised in a very abusive household. He was never given the time he needed to rest and process emotions, to take a break, to have that time your daughter so clearly needs. So in turn my 4 brothers and I have suffered in the emotions category. He used to do stuff like that to us. Wake us up screaming, tell us our problems were nothing because we didn’t have to work 50 hours a week, he never thought about how WE were doing mentally. 

And now at 22 I have the worst relationship with my father. We can’t sit at a table together, I don’t go to him when I’m upset, I don’t call him when something has went wrong, when I am on my breaking point and I feel as though I am drowning and might not make it out, calling my father is the scariest thought to me. 

If you want to save this relationship with your daughter, get your head of your ass and apologize.

College is HARD, being away from family and friends and everything you know is HARD, life is fucking HARD. Why you wouldn’t want your little girl to be okay is beyond me."
