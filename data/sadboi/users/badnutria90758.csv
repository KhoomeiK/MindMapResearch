AMA,fkn0n7p,t1_fkmo4w5,1584347990.0,"Nah the UK drinking culture is extremely prevalent now, especially in Paphos. So most kids are like that now as much as they try to hide it. My service is 14 months, piece of cake. So its a waste of time"
AMA,fklvlvz,t1_fklt9a9,1584315573.0,If you're visiting for ruins and history then definitely up towards the mountain range. Very rich history over there. If you're into beaches then Paphos has some for you

AMA,fkkopc0,t1_fkkimpv,1584288711.0,"Well if u break it down for a few reasons.

1. The island has been divided; 37% is occupied illegally by the Turks and so the community views service as a mandatory fight to reclaim the land.

2. Great money laundering/corruption scheme

3. Easy job placement where only if you act like a criminal you'll lose your job."
AMA,fkk7hzk,t1_fkk6kpd,1584276192.0,Well now we eat only 50 soldiers at a time. Heavy bleach and chlorine usage when mopping and a ban on foreign country leave
AMA,fkjyfwk,t1_fkjy123,1584265495.0,"Pretty odd question haha. So ull be asking for the native pronounciation? So ""Sit"" is ""katse"" pronounced as the ""kat"" from ""katerina"" and ""se"" from ""s√®ance"". ""Stay"" is ""mine"" with ""mi"" pronounced as ""me"" and the ""ne"" as from ""neck""."
AMA,fkjvzvv,t1_fkjvove,1584262223.0,"Well unless im on a shift im allowed on my phone indefinitely, save for whenever im on restaurant/toilet duty. No Wi-Fi so we have to rely on battery draining 4G."
