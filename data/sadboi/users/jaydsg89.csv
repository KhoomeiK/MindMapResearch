I have started incorporating this into my routine, like on Sunday ill go out a buy groceries come back and cook up enough to last the next 3 or 4 days and then do another store visit on Wednesday to keep the food as fresh as I can (I have a very small freezer so tend to refrigerate mostly) . I find it can save you some time in the long run and stops you from eating crap when you have got nothing to go to in your kitchen."

Anyway, since then I killed him twice yesterday on slayer task alone and 4kc total. It's all about getting comfortable with it. I think more realistically a few attempts may suffice if your decent at the game or maybe even first time if your really good/lucky.
