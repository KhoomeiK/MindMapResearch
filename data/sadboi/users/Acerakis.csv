The kid had a website where he fucking uploaded videos of he and his friends slapping people, pushing people over and running away, other stupid pranks as well as girls flashing. I was one of the kids you could clearly make out as being pushed in one of the videos so I was taken out of lesson at some point to be asked if I was being bullied and what the school could do for me. Because schoolboy society is toxic as fuck I just said I didn't want anything done as I knew I would be the one to take the brunt of the blame if anyone got in trouble for ratting. 

Obviously its not like they needed to have anyone speak up considering there was fucking video evidence of him, underage nudity, as well as this being the second time teachers were made aware of him making such a site so second time caught he was out.

BDSMAdvice,fhot2sm,t1_fhosu0a,1581772785.0,Okay just keep putting words in my mouth I guess. Thanks for the advice.
BDSMAdvice,fhospwn,t1_fhos4i0,1581772392.0,"Okay, as I tried to highlight I do very much know the difference between a munch and a play event. I am not sure why you are talking about munches so much as that is not really connected to the issue. I am well aware of how munches work and are purely social events, as stated apparently my knowledge in munch etiquette is respected enough that I am often asked to host the local munch when the usual runner is ill or away.

I am not saying I am entitled to play for turning up but it is indeed an event where many people do turn up and ask people they have not talked to before that night for plays. Many plays are prearranged and many are planned on on the spot. Maybe your play events in your area are different but I am certainly the anomaly in my play environment as far as people negotiating plays go. Please stop talking to me as if I am treating it as a meat factory. For all my self accepted flaws, I know this is not one of them. I am respectful of my friends and their other play partners on the rare occasion I have built up the courage to ask about play."
