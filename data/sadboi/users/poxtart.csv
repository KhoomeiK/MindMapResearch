Libraries,fpbx28c,t3_gci1ip,1588480989.0,"Capital Area District Library (mid-Michigan) closed before our governor announced a general quarantine.  The Board of Directors, working with the Library Director and the union representatives, decided every day we are closed will be like a snowday: Everyone gets paid their contracted hours, plus accrual of all benefits, even the non-Union pages.
 
I should add, I am part of the circulation staff.  So we have been sitting at home with little we can do, since we can't enter the building to begin processing the colossal mounds of material.    So we'll be the first to enter as soon as we are allowed into our libraries.  

Last Thursday we had a general meeting about the reopening procedures.  After May 15th the Library Director will make the call for circ and public service staff to reenter.  First we will need a space plan so everyone can work with adequate distancing.  Our branch head and circ head are using the floor plan from the last remodel to design this.  We are calling this Level 0.  During this time we will clean everything, check everything in, and do our normal circ stuff, and PS will begin hands-on collection management.

Level 1 will see us having curbside pick only, using a call system and dummy box where we can put material to be immediately picked up.  Interlibrary loans will still be paused during this time.  Level 1 will likely be in effect until the beginning of September.  As much of our summer reading program stuff that we can do safely will be done - this means online registration and record keeping for reading rewards, and the PS staff will continue their online youtube and facebook video programming they've valiantly been producing since this whole thing began.  Also: All children's toys in the library have been thrown away.

Level 2 might begin in September.  On a limited-use basis, a certain number of patrons wearing masks will be allowed into the library.  Interlibrary loans will resume (through the MELCAT system).  Patrons will have a limited time to be in the library.  We're not sure how computer usage will work: This is a big draw in our area, and is a resource for the community.  We'll have to wait and see.  We will run on reduced hours for Levels 1 and 2.

Level 3 might not begin until January, when full in-house programming begins again.  We will ease most restrictions by then, with a few caveats, toys and kids area furniture will be replaced, and library work areas will resume normal layouts.  We will probably still encourage curbside pick up (January in Michigan is brutal anyways, so people will likely use it a lot more), and limit time.  

Level 4 will be full service resumption.

During all this we are basically resetting fines.  No one is obviously accruing them right now, and we probably won't assess fines except for damaged items for a long while (and even then, we'll go easy).  Our 13 branches during Levels 1 and 2 are also going to be generally understaffed, as the decision was made, justifiably imo, that any employee who feels unsafe working during Level 1 and perhaps Level 2 will still be paid in full.  So circ staff in particular are going to be moved around a lot.

I realize I'm already running long, but I'd like to say that, as a circ person: Our Public Service staff - librarians, assistants, online content providers - are incredible.  And a shout out to our tech support people who have kept each library open as a wifi hotspot for people who need it for filling for government aid.  And of course, to all my circ staff brethren: Much love and great strength, you are unsung heroes and will be balancing a lot on your shoulders very soon.  Solidarity."

latterdaysaints,fnr9u79,t1_fnr7ydf,1587182910.0,"A rally purportedly about lifting the quarantine in Michigan became a mess.  The protestors - calling themselves ""operation gridlock"" - had traffic at a standstill for hours, even out to East Lansing, though they were especially prevalent in downtown (Lansing being the state's capital, protests frequently happen there, and with good reason; but most don't directly design their protests to block traffic).  Making matters worse, the main through-way to the Capital building is Michigan Ave., on which sits our largest hospital - Sparrow Hospital, a Level 1 trauma center.  Lots of people bearing some unfortunate slogans and insignia of groups *I* find unsavory (including the Patriot Front, a group dedicated to spreading fascism and fear, and who I've seen haranguing people at a local park down the street from the LDS church) were marching about.  It was a fiasco - protestors brought their families downtown, and half the people weren't wearing masks, there was some belligerent chanting about kicking out immigrants, and more slogans designed not to further the cause of reopening the state but just...kind of nasty, cruel things about people.  

I was livid about all this.  People are already scared and angry, and I get that, very much so, my spouse has been laid off and things are tight.  But this was handled just *wrong* on so many levels.  Down from my apartment I can see an Orthodox Church which also hands out meals to people - no one could access their parking lot because these yahoos were blocking the streets.  The priest was livid, motioning for them to move, and some people were throwing up middle fingers to him.  I worry about that sort of thing catching on, especially since arsonists already attack the LDS church some years ago, and it still smarts thinking about it.

I don't want to malign everyone with the same brush.  But I watched car after truck after van blowing through red lights past pedestrians while laughing and honking their horns, important streets were denied to people, and the whole thing had an ugly feeling.  I can just about imagine a Pastor from the LDS church or the Congregational church coming out to try to encourage the traffic to move along, and someone getting handsy with them.

So consequently, I've been angry and frustrated.  But I decided that I'd reach out and contact groups who are really helping people out, and I was inspired by the news that the local LDS and national (and international) church is going all in on supporting food banks and charities, and bringing comfort to people who might be alone in their homes.  It makes me feel good to recognize the good people in my community.  East Lansing is a stronger, better place for having you here."

Thank you to the Islamic Center of East Lansing (Michigan).  These fine neighbors provide free meals to folks no matter their walks of life, religion, nation of origin, etc.  I've had the pleasure to get to know a few of their members, and they are an important part of this community.

pics,fnj5csd,t1_fnizmfl,1586992271.0,"I wish I knew.  One issue is the three and a half decades worth of industrial decline in the southern part of the state (where a lot of these folks are from - there is a persistent myth that they hail from the Upper Peninsula, and I've no doubt there are some yahoos up there too, but most of these pseudo-patriot types are from the suburb counties like Macomb and Oakland), which lead to a lot of generational poverty and crushing economic hardships.  Yet that can't be all of it, plenty of African-Americans suffered far earlier than Michigan's decline into rust belt status.  

Howell was a center for the Klu Klux Klan for ages (and even today the area remains a hotbed of far right organizing); the western coast of the Lower Peninsula is very conservative, bordering on religious reactionary (this is Betsy DeVos territory); there is a lot of just...woods all around the state that attracts people who don't want to be seen; and there is no denying that the Upper Peninsula - which is gorgeous and I encourage everyone to visit - is vacant enough that militias feel confident setting up their dumb encampments.  But really the cities and suburbs are where a lot of these assholes originate.

There are countervailing, anti-reactionary groups in Michigan, too - our history is full of striking miners in the UP (especially the Finns, woah!), of course the creation of the UAW, the student activists and the Port Huron Statement group, the Black Panthers, farmer co-ops, and others.

I guess we can be an ornery people, which is a shame considering we live among this beautiful woodland and lakes, and some awesome cities with beautiful architecture (here in Lansing we have a few fantastic examples of Art Deco)."

I suppose the governor might have called them in, but the last thing we need in Michigan is more hot heads out on the street, acting like petulant entitled children but lugging around guns.

While the group was getting sloshed at an inn, one of her party members started passing notes to the DM - ""I attempt to put a knock-out drug in Kerra's ale"" and ""Can rogues detect poison?""  and so on.  The DM had my partner make a few rolls without telling her what they were for.  Then he announces that ""Kerra, you suddenly feel super woozy, and then pass out.""  The party then used her as bait to lure a ""randy"" and evil nobleman into the inn so they could capture him.  Said nobleman, as roleplayed by the DM, raped my partner's character.

1.  I live in Michigan.  If I lived in Paris or Ankara or Sao Paolo or Bangkok, my opinion about ethnic/religious cleansing of Muslims in China would not change because evidence does not work like that.

2.  The ""Judeo, Christian, Islamic traditions"" (conflating these three into a coherent whole itself is hugely problematic from a historical point of view) are not the ""engines of civilization"" - but are part of a complex system of drivers which push and pull at the fungible concept of ""civilization.""  The world is simply too messy for yours to be a coherent statement.

3.  Ethnic cleansing should ""revolt"" you.

4.  What the heck does paragraph 3's end even mean?  You can't take a ""rational position"" on ethnic cleansing?  Or political policy?  If you are willing to dispense with rationality so easily, why bother commenting?

5.  Paragraph four is a complete red herring.  Shame on you.

6.  No one called you ""cynical"" or ""stupid,"" please stop being self-pitying.  I said that if you ignore the mountain evidence for China's ethnic/religious cleansing, you do so out of a conscious effort to find evidence supporting your own prejudices.

7.  Using the phrase ""virtue signal"" undermines your credibility, misreads the lived experience of Muslims across ""the west,"" and is typically how sociopaths square the cognitive dissonance produced when confronted with altruism.  That is not to say you *are* a sociopath; I think you instead read that phrase somewhere and liked it, and now drop it regularly.

Okay.  Here's the deal.

My point - shared by almost everyone here - still stands.  You have to be willfully obtuse to not see the ethnic/religious cleansing happening in China.  You have not countered this with evidence, only bizarre innuendo.  No one disputes that ""western countries"" engage in horrors.  But we are talking specifically about *this* horror, which is occurring in China *as we speak.""  Other horrors are also happening.

No one is ""posturing"" we are discussing a terrible blight on humanity, a government program of monstrous proportions.  If you feel that one can only do so when the nation of origin of said-critic is of unassailable moral correctness, then your reading habits are shamefully thin.  

Your response is feeble, filled with innuendo and cliche.  The triteness of this reply tells us you do not treat with ideas seriously.  Please have the last word if you would like, but if your response represents your thinking I doubt it will have much utility for our discussion.  Thank you.

Edit: A verb tense."
