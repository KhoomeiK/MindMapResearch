ttcafterloss,fjt0rjv,t1_fjrlzsu,1583602266.0,"I'm sorry, I did the same yesterday 11dpo - same, negative so pretty sure I'm out. Haven't done another since as the words (I did a digital) make it worse so I'll just wait as I've been a wreck. Sending lots of strength"
ttcafterloss,fjrna9s,t3_feq349,1583587644.0,"I'm so sorry, I totally understand how you are feeling, I have been the same each period after MMC late last year. As the above comment says could you maybe have a day off everything - I'm planning to do that this weekend so I can cry as much as I need. I really don't understand people who are so insensitive, there's much need for conversation in the work place and generally in society about appropriate comments around pregnancy and children, I think I've always been quite aware/careful around the subject- being gay and knowing the journey will probably not be straight forward for me, but yeah it's a problem. Sending you lots of strength."
ttcafterloss,fjn27rt,t1_fjn0z4q,1583495199.0,"Thank you so much for this, yes even though it's hard to fight the desperation that pushes me to keep going month in month out you're right I definitely think I need a months break. I just started some counselling to help me process so maybe this could give me time to work with this and change clinics which I think I need. Friends - yes this has been a tough one but im getting there and have a couple who are being supportive which helps. Thanks so much for replying it helps to hear this from someone who has experience - hope you are doing ok."
ttcafterloss,fjmkeb9,t3_fe0akd,1583473216.0,"I'm so sorry you've been through this. I'm also thinking of leaving my job with no job to go to because of insensitivity - well done on doing it, you're doing the right thing, I'll never understand some people and you deserve better."
Anxietyhelp,fjds0f2,t3_fcpxz5,1583258114.0,"I'm trying to do this more, it takes such a lot of practice, it's not fully working yet but I will keep going, thank you for sharing..."

ttcafterloss,fijn6w5,t1_fi6otnz,1582455933.0,"Thank you for this and hope you are doing okay today. Yes I totally agree, this experience has made me so much more empathetic and thoughtful...you just don't know what people are experiencing/have experienced. I think going forward sadly I wouldn't tell anyone what is happening for me on this journey as it makes the pain harder and lonelier knowing I've confided in people and their response is disappointing/hurtful. I also realise I need to broaden my network of friends, meet new people, it's kind of really woken me up. Sending strength for today."
ttcafterloss,fi1gi8p,t3_f5wvzb,1582057294.0,"Like the above I think some people just don't know what to say - I'm really sorry people aren't checking in on you, I know it feels terribly lonely, sending lots of ðŸ’ª. In my experience I've simply found my friends are very selfish. I miscarried 3 months ago and since I've had one failed IUI attempt which broke me again. I don't have a partner - doing this on my own and non of my friends have visited me since my miscarriage -one just didn't turn up when they said they'd come visit, one called to say sorry for my loss (I think) and then proceeded to tell me how she gets no time for herself now she has her baby but she just had a weekend off for a retreat while her partner stayed at home ðŸ¤·...it was like she kind of just wanted to offload (the usual). Going through this has changed me..."

Miscarriage,fi08w66,t3_f5i92k,1582030503.0,"I can absolutely relate, having a miscarriage has affected all of my relationships - the lack of support/care I've received has left me feeling so lonely and I don't think the relationships can be fixed now tbh. Sending lots of strength.."

depression,fedhhmk,t3_eokf9j,1579011643.0,"this happens to me a lot, its great you're recognising it and questioning it. I agree with the comments before mine - give it some time, make a plan if you need to but definitely think on it before acting. If you are unwell and its possible maybe take some time off"
depression,fedh5gl,t3_eokgoc,1579011391.0,"Yes i understand, i feel i've become more isolated because of it recently as I can tell the truth that I fee bad and then feel guilty, or I can fake it which is draining and I'm too tired for that..."
depression,fedgyvk,t3_eoklu8,1579011252.0,"I get this, this is common for me too and I think its a coping mechanism and also a tiredness, a tiredness of the repetition"
depression,fed9ivt,t3_eokgg9,1579004710.0,thank you for this!
Miscarriage,fe6t662,t3_enl92x,1578904248.0,"Can absolutely relate, I felt the same and have my second coming up and still feel pretty bad actually. I've tried to keep myself busy. My first period came when my family were visiting just before xmas and so I had them to focus on. I've also thrown myself into elements of work I normally wouldn't - getting very organised with spreadsheets etc. I know it sounds stupid but its how I've stopped my mood and thoughts spiralling. I've also spent quite a bit of time alone in between to listen to how I'm feeling and process. I'm single and got pregnant with donor at a fertility clinic and so it's not as straight forward as just trying again, I have to wait for appointments and have the available money etc so I'm having to learn to be patient and just let go and be super kind to myself (which I find hard). All of it is hard and so sending you lots of strength - try to be kind to yourself."
depression,ews8i59,t3_cpvwhh,1565722331.0,oh I feel this so much!
depression,ews89r4,t3_cpidz8,1565722207.0,"so true, I worry that I've walked away from things because of this - people who love me have assured me that is not what happened but its confusing dealing with depression - what is the depression and what is me making a decision outside of it - if that makes sense. I go round in circles thinking about it sometimes (which I think is the depression and low self esteem that comes with it). Anyway thank you for sharing."
depression,ews7ugw,t3_cptvo7,1565721972.0,"Great to hear this, I'm having a pretty rough day and its a good reminder that things are temporary - its so hard to remember that sometimes - thanks for sharing"
depression,etkyppo,t3_cc4mpq,1562913582.0,congrats - I'm going to do this now!!! thanks for sharing and inspiring others to push through
depression,eou7t7z,t1_eoskazx,1558859218.0,"doesn't sound like a friend, I've been putting up with people like that for a long time and I'm moving on from it now. She doesn't sound conventionally attractive either to be honest, a comment like that would put me right off someone."
depression,eou7mut,t3_bt0kck,1558859025.0,"Yes totally relate. To add to other comments, I don't think it's *always* about age  (although for some people it is), there are people who feel like this all their life or at different stages of their life, it can be more complicated than something you move through with age (although not taking away this can happen). There are lots of factors that can make people feel this way."
