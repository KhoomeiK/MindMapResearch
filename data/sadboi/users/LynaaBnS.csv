DestinyTheGame,fqwiib1,t3_gkxych,1589705662.0,"Because that's not what wow and ffixv and other mmos do? For example, in update 1.0 the best weapon, comes from the raid, the currently hardest activity in the game, the raid drops the weapon X, with update 2.0, you need the weapon X, to beat the new raid, in this raid you get the new best weapon Y, in update 3.0 you need the weapon Y, to beat the newest raid, to get the new best weapon named Z.

*that* is how mmos work, you do the hardest activity in the game and you get rewarded with the best weapon. You need the best gear in the game, to properly farm the next and harder content.

In destiny all of this doesn't matters. Because gear and gear score is a joke. It doesn't matter what you use and even rolls do barely matter. You can do raids EASILY with blue gear."
