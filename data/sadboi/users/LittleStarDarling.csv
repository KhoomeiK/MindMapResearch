On that self care idea, my favourite so far is self-care bingo, which I find really fun and motivating. 

I'll definitely be trying the goals page, I'm usually so bad at setting goals and far worse at keeping them, but I think having them written down inn some place I'll frequently check might be effective."

You're dad's awesome, btw :)"
bipolar,fe73ar1,t1_fe09fzk,1578909416.0,">You’ve inspired me to try journaling.

Wow, thanks. 

I see what you're saying about it being a lot of mental work, I have found that it can be challenging, but do really want to start better understanding myself and being more aware of my state of mind. I think it may take a while to see any progress, so for now I'm just holding tight :)"

BipolarReddit,fdyv3wh,t1_fdyjib8,1578783928.0,"Thanks so much for linking that article, it was such good reading.

Otherwise, like you, I use my journal predominantly for brain dumping, in the hopes that it will gradually begin to clear the clutter in my mind. 

I'm working on making it a habit, without beating myself up about missing a few days. I'm sure I read somewhere that it takes approximately 30 days to make something a habit, so that's the first SMART goal I'm working towards.

As you mentioned, I do find it easy to get overwhelmed especially with all the extra decorations and garnishes for each page, but I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself about appearances.

Thank you for your comment, it was really insightful!"

bipolar,fdycy5w,t1_fdxtz3a,1578778400.0,"Thank you for the detailed reply. After reading your experience, I will be wary of the effect journalling has on me in the future. So far it has been okay, I did get a little worked up about missing writing for a few days, and I have a tendency to blow those things out of proportion currently, but I got past it.

I'm sorry the music didn't work out for you, its pretty crap that gender of all things carries such limitations in that field. (I'm female too).

I'll certainly have to look into those guided journals because they sound fun, and entertaining to read back. Week by week calendars I can handle, but I find that for me, anything larger throws me. I think seeing lots of space and dates and time is a big no no.

Honestly after a little over a week of trying out the bujo system I'm planning on adapting it around my daily journal. I had watched so many YouTube videos for inspiration, but I think the amount that's going on in mine is simply too much to handle. I think I'm going to just keep it to trackers and lists from now on. Whilst having the daily journal for brain dumping. That's the plan anyway.

Thanks for sharing, I am now aware of things to look out for :)"

I've also got a terrible memory, and am quite bad at slotting events into a timeline (from what I've read on this sub, the memory issue seems to be a problem a fair amount of us face). So it would be really great to have a way of keeping and storing memories. 

Thanks for bringing light to this!"
BipolarReddit,fdxmnpw,t1_fdxfn0l,1578770642.0,"Thanks for your reply, it's really encouraging! I've been really wanting to get into journalling for quite a while because I have trouble organising my thoughts and sorting through them so I can focus on what's right in front of me, and I thought it would help. But I wasn't sure if giving myself the pressure of having to write an entry every day would be counteractive. 

However, I've settled on just trying to write something everyday, not necessarily an entry. And otherwise you've convinced me!

I used to feel that way. I never really fit in with the people I surrounded myself with, and that knowledge not only made me feel lonely but also lowered my regard of myself.

Recently however, I seem to have found myself in a group of people that are more like me, and it's easier to be myself around them, easier to feel content with who I am.

Yet I'm still stuck clinging onto both groups, mostly because I'm a people-pleaser, partly because change throws me off balance."

Honestly, I'm confused. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, this isn't what my depression feels like. It has some aspects of depression but I don't think that's it. 

But then, I don't feel normal either. Not that I really remember how that feels. I'm just very confused at the moment. And what I've written is only part of what's going on.

That's why some people prefer to speak to a helpline first; they can help you sort through your thoughts and build up your confidence so that when you are ready, you'll find it easier to explain how you feel. It's also nice to know that even if you aren't quite ready after the first call, you can just hang up and leave it at that. Having a real person, not just a robot, that won't judge you or be completely startled by your confessions also helps you to feel okay.

I'm a lucid dreamer, which has its advantages and its drawbacks. One of drawbacks being that, as far as I know, during a lucid nightmare the only way to wake yourself up (aside from using external sources) is to die, or rather to almost die. For example, I will intentionally throw myself off of a skyscraper in the knowledge that I am bound to wake up before I hit the ground. And I have heard from other people that frequently lucid dream, that they either do something similar or the same.

So that is a little background on where my perspective is originating from."

Grounding helps. Focusing on each of your senses: strong smells, contrasting textures, music that you love or feel a connection to. Anything to bring you back into your body.

Try to figure out what's triggering it. How do you feel before it happens? How do you feel afterwards? I would recommend bringing it up with your care team."
BipolarReddit,fb799in,t3_ebswvl,1576580926.0,"Mostly a discussion, an in depth talk about your symptoms and how they are affecting your life and your ability to function, a little digging into your family history.

It's very unlikely that you will go away with a diagnosis, but you should leave with a temporary treatment plan of sorts. This usually includes: information about sleep hygiene, grounding techniques, how to calm anxiety, numbers to call in crisis.

Any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Best wishes for your appointment, try to be as open and honest as possible, you're making the first step and that's great :)

So, at the time, the first time, I had injured my arm and it has happened at a really crucial time in my life when I really needed to write. I am in full time education, and it was exam season, and it sucked. I felt so upset and destroyed because it felt like I was watching everything I'd worked for crumble before me, so I started hitting my already swollen and tender wrist against hard objects. That marked my beginning.

More recently though, I was going through a bad depression and I started cutting. It started off as an accident; I had all these blades that I had kept and stored away but had never actually used, never thought or planned to use, and I was just playing with them when I accidentally pushed too hard and hurt myself. And then after that one time I just kept doing it over and over again, intentionally and somewhat compulsively.
