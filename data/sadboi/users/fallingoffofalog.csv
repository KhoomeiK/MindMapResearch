In elementary school I developed pneumonia because chicken pox greatly weakened my immune system. I spent 4 days in the hospital, but I wasn't scared because my mom stayed with me the whole time, and she never showed any fear. She told me years later that she thought I wasn't going to make it.

The first issue is drugs. Drugs are a huge problem in WV, much moreso than when I left. As a woman, though, I didn't feel threatened walking through downtown Charleston during the day. It's like any other city -- some parts are worse than others.

The biggest issue (I think) is little employment opportunity followed by low wages. If you're in medicine you'll be ok, otherwise... Meh.

Internet access is iffy outside the city.

Infrastructure is crap.

That said, Charleston has some passionate residents that have niche businesses and that are committed to making the area a better place. Good eats abound. Residents are generally friendly. Cost of living is low, you can get a lovely house in city limits (Kanawha City area) near the water for $200k or less. You're close to nature and great hiking, biking, and rafting. 

If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them as best I can."

What interests me is that the colors are all very saturated, but the characters still stand out as the focal point. In the image with the tiger, this is accomplished by the cooler-colored (and slightly less saturated) mountains in the background. Around the tiger's legs and belly, where the shading might otherwise make the tiger blend into the water, it's differentiated by white outlines. In the other images, the characters stand out because of their shading, though really only the edges are shaded.

They also use no neutrals at all, except for some white thrown in on occasion."

What was your process of diagnosis like? - The first doctor I visited ran blood tests and said my thyroid was fine. I moved across the country soon after, and the following year my new doctor said I had underactive thyroid. I moved again the following year to my current location, and my doctor said I probably have Hashimotos, but he didn't run tests because I had no insurance. Last year he hired a physician's assistant, who did run the blood work and said it was 97% likely I have Hashimotos. She referred me to an endocrinologist, whom I haven't seen yet (My appointment is still a few weeks away).

What did your doctor do to treat it? - They put me on thyroid supplements, first Synthroid, and then Armour when I requested a change. That was before my initial Hashis diagnosis, though. We'll see what the endo says.

Did you do anything on your own to treat it? - I tried CBD oil, which didn't do a lot. I went on an elimination diet and cut out lactose. I've failed so far at being gluten free.

What worked for you? - Nothing. I found out I was lactose intolerant, but removing dairy didn't help my thyroid health at all.

How did your quality of life change throughout the treatment process? - It's honestly so bad now that I can't work. My fatigue and brain fog is terrible and I have absolutely no energy or ability to concentrate. When I try to work  or stay on my feet for long it makes me shaky.

Maybe you should take time off from college, just get a full-time job and give yourself time away from an academic environment. Then in 6 months or a year you can re-evaluate if you want to continue your degree.

Here's the thing about fiber arts: you really don't need a degree for it. Even if you do decide to finish your degree, it can take years before you start to make a living from your art, so you're probably going to need a day job anyway. If you're really struggling with a college environment, it might be better to go about your dream a different way.

So, yeah, in short, I'd say take some time away from classes to reevaluate. Maybe look into getting involved in the local arts community if you're not already. Find out how other artists have made a living from their passion, because one thing art schools are terrible about is telling you how to weave, but then not telling you how to make a living from it.
