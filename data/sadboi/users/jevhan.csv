AskReddit,fixupee,t3_faednm,1582827008.0,"Honestly speaking, I've always been the kind of person to say 'It's fine. It's not that serious'. Mostly because I've always kept ***Forever Naps*** as an option for me. My family outside of my aunt, uncle, and my cousins always tried to be supportive. But it was my girlfriend who actually made a difference. She'd been pushing me to talk to my uncle for months, and so one day, I went to my aunt, and told her how I'd been feeling. She told my uncle (he's a doctor), and so they've been trying with me ever since. It hasn't been easy, and sometimes, I go off my meds, and end up feeling as suicidal as before (I have suicidal tendencies). I OD'd two weeks ago, and I guess my mom who previously said (it's all in my head and I shouldn't dwell on it), has been trying to get me to see a therapist. It's a work in progress, and even with the sad gone, with all of the attempts that I have piled up behind me. The option of forever naps is still prevalent. 

That being said, after I OD'd recently, the majority of my family has kinda ignored it (I have a history of self harm, and it's kinda noticeable considering my arms and thighs are heavily scarred. So even with the ones who have reached out to me, sometimes the knowledge that I'm the black sheep of the family, and that the rest of them would probably prefer if I was gone so that I no longer would be a stain on the family reputation (Imagine being the only atheist in a christian family). It's hard, but because of my younger cousins, my brother, and my uncle and aunt. I'm trying a bit harder."

When you touch the ground, get back in position, lower yourself again. Work up to 10, then try to get one pushup in, with that form. You can also do the same with incline."

The bad days just outnumber them exponentially. We can't deny that we have loved ones either. We just shut them out because we hate ourselves and think that they're lying when they say they care, or convince ourselves that they're better off without us. The problem is figuring out. Is the misery really worth this. I'll be a hypocrite for saying this. But if you have any spare notebooks or notepads.

I only attempt on weekends or during vacations, because I don't want to leave my workload on the others. I'm a burden in life, don't want to be one in death. But the thing is, suicidal thoughts and tendencies rarely follow logical patterns. I have high functioning depression so I can normally deal with bad times, but sometimes it gets too much for maybe an hour. If I have any more time than that, I still have the feelings but I retain thought. My dad's depressed, my mom's schizophrenic. I don't know what would happen to my dad.

AskReddit,ey31iq7,t3_cv6tjh,1566753112.0,"I have a lot of stories. 

My dad walked from Manhattan where he worked to Brooklyn sometimes daily to save money for us to go to school. 

I found out recently that my dad would collect random jewelry that he found on the street and pawned them to be able to pay the rent. 

Using one of those Energizer lamp things around the dinner table with pizza (Thank God for little Caesars) because the light bill and gas bill weren't paid. 

My brother and I having a bunk bed, but he had a mattress and I had an inflatable mattress that got punctured so eventually I just slept on the deflated mattress. 

Moving the majority of your stuff to storage because you're downsizing to a room. Your dad sleeping on the floor, my brother on the bottom bunk, and me on the top. I think eventually my brother had either moved out or we slept together because we hated my dad sleeping on the floor but he always insisted. So we finally got him on the bottom bunk. 

I've lived in two basements, one room, and a one bedroom apartment for the most of my life growing up. 

One year when I was like 9 and my brother was 13, for Christmas we took one of the bills either the electricity or light and paid it as a gift. My dad cried. 

With an unlimited MetroCard you can only use it once at a turnstile. My dad would swipe at one station for me, then walk to the next station and use the card there, where is wait for him. So that we could get where we're going. 

Two or three people in the revolving turnstile, or ducking under the turnstile. 

Being stranded in California because your grandfather kicked your father, mother, brother and you out. Simply because your mother had a mental breakdown and he thought she was lazy. Ended up where some kind lady gave up her seat (We had enough for one ticket), so that we could ride as a family back to new York. 

Birthday parties are non-existent because they're expensive, but one gift a year means more than having a bunch. 

Bonding times being a slice of pizza and Gatorade (less than $10) and going to battery park to sit and chill, and the other bonding times being working with my dad because it's more efficient that way. Plus I loved meeting the people he worked with. 

I have a ton more but these are just some of the highlights of my life before I was 14."

I know the thought that goes into a good suicide and I know why it has to be an accident, negating the suicide aspect to minimize the damage to loved ones. But that means I can't act on my feelings. Not to mention being unable to talk about my feelings when I have strong negative feelings because I know that I feel bad and if I say the things that I want to, I'll hurt the person I'm venting to. There's no easy way to say ""I don't feel like you love me. I don't think I can feel loved. I just feel like people pick me because they've had bad past experiences and settle for me because I have a good personality. So they think that an attractive personality with an attractive face doesn't happen"". So I have to keep it in because it's volatile and I know I'll have to still stifle my feelings for the sake of not hurting them.
