I‚Äôm 22 now and for the last few years I‚Äôd given up on chasing a diagnosis, both because I‚Äôm sick of being told otherwise by mental health professionals and because I found the stigma bpd carries so discouraging that it outweighed the support I received from these forums and no longer felt I benefitted from identifying with it.

WORST for acne (likely to make acne prone individuals experience occasional breakouts):

-Norgestrel & Ethinyl Estradiol (Ogestrel, Cryselle, Low-Orgestrel, Lo / Ovra)

-Norethindrone 1 mg & Ethinyl Estradiol (Junel, Junel FE, Microgestin, Microgestin FE  , Gildess FE, Loestrin, Loestrin FE; Necon 1/35, Ovcon, & Nortrel are slightly better but not by a lot)

-Levonorgestrel 0.15 mg & Ethinyl Estradiol (Jolesse, Portia, Quasense, Levora, Nordette, Seasonale)

-Ehtynodiol diacetate  & Ethinyl Estradiol (Zovia, Kelnor)

Moderate for Acne (potential to make acne worse or better):

-Norethindrone 0.5 mg & Ethinyl Estradiol (Necon 0.5 / 35, Nortrel 0.5 / 35, Brevicon)

-Norethindrone 0.4 mg & Ethinyl Estradiol (Balziva  , Zenchant, Ovcon-35, Femcon Fe Chew)

-Norgestimate & Ethinyl Estradiol (Mononessa, Previfem, Sprintec, Ortho-Cyclen)

-Desogestrel & Ethinyl Estradiol (Apri, Reclipsen, Solia, Desogen, Ortho-Cept)

-Levonorgestrel 0.10 mg &  Ethinyl Estradiol (Aviane, Lessina, Lutera, Sronyx, Alesse)

BEST for acne (protective against acne):

-Drosperinone & Ethinyl Estradiol (Ocella, Yasmin, Yaz, Gianvi)"
