AskReddit,fmjhzw3,t3_fvn15m,1586130698.0,"The Sarku Japanese food that is located in different malls. 

I used to get it with my family a lot when I was younger as every time we’d take a long, shopping trip to the mall we’d stop in the food court. It’s also one of the few food places both of my older brothers express interest in. They’re both very picky eaters, and not in the same way.

My boyfriend does not understand my interest in this place at all (I’ve hardly explained what y’all now know to him). 

But now that my family has moved away from each other & I actually reside in a whole different state than the rest... I have made trips to a mall out of town with no intention of shopping just for the meal on multiple occasions."
schizophrenia,fmje9br,t1_fmjc9xz,1586128561.0,"Thank you so much & of course!

So basically I used a decent, thicker acrylic paint (masters touch) & a fairly priced pouring medium (liquitex) on white canvas for supplies!

Technique for this one goes kinda like using a higher paint to lower mixing medium ratio, mixing the medium with each color you want to use until it’s a smooth as you can get it, and then just layering the colors that you like over one another into a cup with a semi long, narrow spout to pour it onto the canvas!

Hope this helped! If you have anymore questions I’m an open book"

Most often I try to take a neutral stance! It works sometimes, but I’ve noticed that he comes to me a lot with something he wants an opinion on or confirmation of. We were always the closet to each other growing up & at some points all the other had. As you can imagine he has a great trust and respect for my perspectives. 

For example, before his diagnosis, he was the type to ask and trust in my responses first to all girl, fashion, educational advice, etc.
With this, I can see him reaching to me mostly for things he wants insight on or help with.

The neutral approach is my go-to, thanks for the reassurance. I will now try distraction methods since, now that I think of it, I’ve hardly tried to redirect his thinking process in these times :)"
