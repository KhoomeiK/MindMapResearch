I was a little overweight and thought cutting out alcohol would allow me to lose weight.  It didn‚Äôt.  It did make my sleep better.  I moved around better, too.  I also began to set physical goals.  These goals included: running a 5K at my own pace and sticking to a workout routine three days a week.  Last year, my goal was a half marathon.  This year more runs with a goal of completing a marathon in October -my second sober anniversary.  Until a month ago, I was around the same weight so I started tracking what I ate and made adjustments along the way and I have lost a few pounds.  For me, sobriety came first even if it meant I ate a lot of sugary items and soda.  Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself.  Walk.  Find a class.  Exercise will find you."

Alcohol contributes to inflammation.  It dilates your cellular system.  As a result, I had frequent headaches and aches in my joints.  I could not get a solid workout in due to various aches and pains.  Bursitis in my rotator cuff; hip and knee pains.

I started to workout with weights and did some cardio.  I used to joke that I worked out to counteract the effects of drinking.  The last two years of drinking and working out were counterproductive.  I would sweat profusely.  I realized I probably smelled, too.

The first two weeks after quitting were the worst.  Bad headaches and anxiety.  I wanted to punch someone out.  Within a month, the headaches were gone.  My workouts - both weights and cardio improved.  After six months, my recovery time improved.  I realized I no longer had periods of aches and pains.  No longer did I have to do special shoulder or hip treatments.  

When you are not in pain, your overall physical fitness can improve.  In October, I celebrated my year sobriety by completing a half marathon.  Keep moving...."

I still have the same urge to medicate before and during social events.  However, those feelings are very brief.  15 minutes before and 15 minutes into event.  If there are people I know and like, my interactions are better now than ever and  my connections are satisfying.  If it is a business gathering, I usually go to an AA meeting before or after.  I always have an escape plan.  Honestly, I have only had to do that a handful of times over the past 11 months.  Another strategy is to arrive early and leave early.
