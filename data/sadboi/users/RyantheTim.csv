Rounds are so much fun to make! I'm Jewish, my family makes challah about every other week (and freezes for the next week).
Fun fact: round challahs are traditionally made for the Jewish new year (comes out September-october, but it's a lunar calendar so it changes some year to year).
Both round and long are gorgeous and beautiful.
If you want to take it to the next level: put cinnamon and sugar or chocolate chips in one or more strands to make a sweet challah. I've also had with sauted onions in one strand (I think-maybe garlic too) for a savory challah. If you have it-everything but the bagel spice is incredible as well."

If it isn't comfortable for you, let them know. It's okay to talk about how therapy is going with your therapist, what is helpful and what isn't.

It's also totally fine to find a new therapist. But if this one is helpful and the issue is the awkward pauses, let them know. Of course, it may not be intentional on their part. But it could be."

For Biology and biochemistry, the most helpful thing has been making giant flowcharts on my wall about how the topics are related to each other.

The most important thing is to assess yourself as you are learning, how much are you understanding, and asking questions when you don't fully ""get"" something.

Also, how to be a straight a student is a decent book, though somewhat unrealistic."

University and college aren't interchangeable. Universities are research institutions with government funding for that research, most colleges don't do much research at all. This makes universities cheaper, more competitive, and more prestigious. For a 3 year university degree, with the exception of remedial English, dorms etc the price is 30,000 NIS, or less than 10,000 US dollars.
BSc or BA degrees are 3 years. When you apply, you apply directly to your program/major, and between 60 and 100 percent of your courses are required for your major. Double majors aren't uncommon for this reason. Most humanities don't require math courses, except statistics (for research). Only language requirement is English, and many test out of that before applying. Science majors don't take literature or writing classes, unless they need extra credits. No maximum number of courses per semester, so a full time student spends 40 hrs a week in class.
Also, most college students start when they are 23-24, after 2-3 of army service, some time taken of for travel and to apply to college."
