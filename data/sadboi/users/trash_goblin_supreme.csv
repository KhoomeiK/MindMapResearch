His current mom met him at that shelter and after he recovered, she took him home. They have 5 other rescued kitties and 3 rescued pitties so I call their house the island of misfit cats lol

I think if the masses make a change and demand corporations and governments to do so as well it's possible to change globally. I'll admit I can be quite pessimistic sometimes though. The question is rather  or not the change comes soon enough.
