depression,ewdbe78,t3_cd0hjp,1565298058.0,I had three sessions at 500 I never did lsd but I agree it feels like taking a very mild trip. Afterwards you come back very slowly and when I got home I went to sleep. I wanted to give it a fair chance so I did three I didnâ€™t feel any lasting effects and everything that I had read said that it was almost a miracle the way that they felt immediate improvement just didnâ€™t happen for me. Maybe you will have better luck!!!

depression,ev1ik75,t3_cd0hjp,1564159155.0,"About an hour altogether you have to come down before you can leave you have to have someone drive you
It felt like getting in touch with your inner self I read somewhere that itâ€™s like a LSD trip anyway it did not have any lasting effects for me I was really disappointed because I had heard it was nearly a miracle treatment 
Itâ€™s very expensive $500 a shot 
Thatâ€™s just me maybe it will work for you 
Good luck!!!"
