But I've already hurt her enough by ditching the family religion and telling her about how I've barely tasted happiness my entire life. 

I also feel like a useless son when my other siblings are already married, living in their own houses and have kids. Meanwhile I'm just a sorry mess at home trying to survive part-time uni and find a proper job. I'm really bad at expressing myself so I feel bad for my mom sometimes. I want to celebrate mother's day but that means thanking her for giving birth to me and raising me up etc. But I'm honestly tired of life and always wish I wasn't born so celebrating it is kind of hard.

Sorry for my rant. Anyway, I hate any kind of day where we seek forgiveness or celebrate someone's existence. Doesn't mean much to me honestly. How you treat that person the rest of the year is what matters."
