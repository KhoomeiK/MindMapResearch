SuicideWatch,fecs04l,t3_eog9ns,1578982389.0,"My heart breaks for what you've gone through. Your words show how much pain you're in. I felt angry on your behalf that your brother has the nerve to lecture you.

I've had friends who were abused sexually by uncles, parents' friends, acquaintances, or cousins. They went through very similar desires to kill themselves after. 

I just want to say that what happened to you was wrong. I'm sad that you were not protected from such messed up things.

I really hope that you can find peace because this situation seems completely unfair. I'm upset that this happened to you and that no one protected you.

As a daughter of East Asian immigrants, I found that there's cultural favoritism of sons. I felt sad growing up because I heard from my mom that my dad was disappointed that I was born a girl.

However, I am glad now that I was born a woman, and even if you say that your parents didn't mean to have you, I'm glad that you were born. You are worth so much more than how people have treated you.

It seems like you're doubting whether your memories are even real. If you are feeling such strong despair with your brother being home, it doesn't seem like you are remembering incorrectly.

Do you mind if I ask what you think might happen if you tell your parents about what your brother did?"

I had a problem with a prescription drug that went away when I was hospitalized for psychiatric issues. If you're desperate, you can join a rehabilitation center or clinic that specializes in substance abuse.

If you're in the U.S., [https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) has a treatment center locator. It says it's for behavioral health but once you put in your location, there will be a checkbox for ""Substance Use."" Check that and different centers should pop up.

Advice,fdpr3hh,t3_ema1d0,1578637295.0,"I am very much like that. Anger usually comes when we feel wronged. I recommend the book Feeling Good by David Burns. There's a chapter on anger that I found very helpful. 

Try writing what you're thinking of when you feel angry. For example, I got mad when my mom yelled at me and my thought was ""I don't deserve to be treated like this!"" Then, try to come up with a rational response. My response to my original thought was ""I may not deserve it, but I can't control what other people do and I will only get more upset if I keep thinking this way. I can instead control what I do and leave the situation."" 

Therapy can also help if you find a good therapist but it can be pricey.

I don't think it's a bad thing, as long as you're okay with the hug and it doesn't escalate into something romantic, which seems like a bad idea and is probably illegal.

Otherwise, I'm sorry you're not feeling too great. I hope you find more things to make you feel good. Others have suggested volunteering, which has helped me too. I think you might enjoy a more cheerful environment than a hospital or hospice. I volunteer with children, but there are lots of ways to volunteer. Whatever your interests are, you can find somewhere that aligns with your them. For example, if you like nature, you could volunteer at a local garden or arboretum. 

Besides volunteering, having a day to care for yourself can help too. It can help to do something you really enjoy or to make yourself a nice meal and watch a movie you like.

Yeah, suicide hotlines suck and don't help much. I've called CAPS too and haven't gotten an appointment. What helped me was the book Feeling Good by David Burns, but in your position, I think a book might help once you've gotten medical treatment. There are also support groups hosted by DBSA (Depression and bipolar support alliance) in Orange County at different locations. I know what you mean about wanting to sleep forever and forgetting everything. I had a time when I didn't leave my bed except to eat and use the restroom.

If your therapist is hard to get a hold of, it might be time to find someone else. Also, don't rule out medication. Mine helped a lot when I was losing grip of reality. Worst case scenario, if you really are thinking of ending your life, call 911. When I was at the hospital, I was able to get medi-cal (health insurance for the disabled and poor) even though I didn't qualify. The nice thing about American hospitals is that they will help you even if you don't have insurance. 

Sadly, I don't know how hard it is to grow up without family, so I'm sorry you're going through this without a support system. Regardless, your life has worth, even if it doesn't feel that way.

It took me years to get treatment that finally helped me, and I went through about 4 therapists to find one that could help me. I definitely thought about ending it many times. But even when there seems to be no hope, I think there still is, as cheesy as that sounds.
