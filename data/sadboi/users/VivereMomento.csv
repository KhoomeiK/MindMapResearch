So last year I cut him off, and now I’m blamed for destroying our tiny family. I went to brother2 with a plan to move forward, either he got therapy or id never be in his life again, he agreed and we were starting to get better. But that was 3 months ago, he’s not following through with his end of the deal so I don’t want to hear about him. So my mom is pissed at me for keeping to my word.

Honestly, I think real life is supposed to be this difficult as a child, I can’t see any century where this wasn’t the truth until now, and now we have all these adults who can’t cope and society telling us we should have been given a childhood like them so that we could wind up not being able to cope just like them now.

The second brother n I have a tragic history, when he was 6 and I was 4 he found our fathers skin mags and decided I was a girl, and there.... but I’ve dealt with that, I’ve been able to separate the fact that a 6 year old boy has no fracking idea, how it traumatized him too, it’s just really horrible that it was him and me. But he’s always been abusive towards me, physically until I ran away at 15, and then mentally really bad. I thought we were getting past it, and I was just starting to stand up for myself in the last few years especially after I got a very bad diagnosis 3 years ago... But last April it exploded, I nearly succeeded in taking my life, and now I’m being blamed for tearing the family apart because I refuse to be near brother 2 until he starts getting therapy (which he did agree to try, so I was trying also) 
Brother 2 is a rig pig, no consequences but all the “free speech” you can listen to. Brother #1 actually listened to me when I tried to take my life, realized my illness was taking serious consequences and that came with it and has seriously stepped up as a brother and as a friend, I never thought we could be friends but he’s a great friend now even with his flaws. 

Our bio father ran our house like a 50s sexist house, I was inside cooking, cleaning and darning socks, while the “men” were outside hauling trees, fixing engines, and if that 14 year old boy couldn’t keep a snowmobile lifted for long then he got beat.

Previous attempts at getting help in an ER have given me ptsd, nurses who belittle me and comment about me within 5 feet of me just so they know I can i hear. Telling me I don’t need to be in the ER after having anaphylaxis resulting in 2 epi pens to get to hospital. Telling me I’m just looking for drugs because there is no massive wound to prove the pain. 
They even look out my gallbladder full well knowing that was not the source of my pain. 
I’ve woken up during procedures before because they didn’t dose me right to keep me knocked out. 
I have really difficult veins for IVs, it usually takes over 6 pokes to get an IV started on me and never listen when I tell them where the best spots are to get them on me, then look all surprised when they finally try that spot and suddenly the IV works. 

I went in for suicide attempt once and didn’t see a dr even once, the nurse who was wearing god awful amounts of aftershave, said I was in distress and said I needed a b12 shot and to go through a work book on what being in distress is and how to breathe properly. Then they let me walk out of their ER in worse mental shape than when I went in.

So it pays for them to only have healthy normal people as patients that just get the common cold who are in and out of their office in minutes. Where as people like me need longer visits, more research work in between, treatment plans that involve more than just the dr, tests and more.

HealthAnxiety,fpvd8bd,t1_fpv4c55,1588942089.0,"I have a pretty horrific medical history because of drs ignoring things they shouldn’t, refusing to do regular tests because I was fat and that’s why I was hurting (I had actually fractured my spine in that case)
Then it was convincing the drs to do tests. Then convincing the drs to send me for referrals. And then I got my diagnoses from a geneticist and no dr will take me on as a patient.

Where I live healthcare is kinda free, but you have to have a family dr to get anything at all done. Well, after I got my diagnosis I needed a family dr for continuing treatment + more.... turns out drs here can also refuse to take you as a patient for any reason. I’ve been denied family dr care by 102 drs in the last 3 years alone. 102 appointments I showed up for only to be told they wouldn’t take me as a patient “your on pain meds “ “your case is too complicated” “you’re not worth my time” “there is nothing I can do for you. My favourite is the “there is nothing I can do for you you need to see an internist” but you can’t see an internist without a family dr referral. Same goes with mental health, same goes with lady drs, you can’t see them unless you’ve been reffed. Referrals take 6 months or so if you’re lucky. 

I suffer from really terrible medical ptsd, there have been a few times were I have been awake in surgery or minor procedures that I very much wasn’t supposed to be awake for. 

All my drs hear is “she wants more pain meds” what I’m really saying is can we address the issue causing the pain problem so we can reduce my pain meds. Nope. It took me 6 months to get sleeping pills, when I get into a pain cycle I need something to instruct that cycle, like sleep would be great. My dr thought I was asking for no pain meds, after a while of me basically telling her to shut up and listen to me she clued in that I need sleeping pills, 3 nights of sleep and 60% of the pain was gone... who would have thought.

 I’m getting iron infusions right now and the nurses can’t poke me with a needle to get a IV more than once. Then they didn’t prepare ahead getting an ultrasound machine up there to scan my veins to get one. So they had to call someone from Anaesthesiologist to come start my IV. While were waiting I’m in my room and I can hear the nurses complaining about me at th desk. Each one comes in and tries to get my to let them poke around. Nope. Nope. 5th time,  old nurse comes in looks feels my arms, slaps them up a bit, claiming she’s got a vein right here let’s try it, she was passed I said no, so finally I let one try, they failed horribly. Then thank gods The anaesthesiologst shows up, I’m having a panic attack, he kicks the nurses out of the room n starts talking to me. Realizes I have no issue with pain like they made him to believe. Stuck me once and got it, he told me to not feel bad and I should stand my ground because I can’t putting my veins at risk for their big egos.

I suggest getting the tick/flea shot from the vet if you can afford it. Otherwise, get them off one by one, check yourself of course and anyone who touches the dog/is very close to the dog... 
give your dog some extra lovin and move forward. It happens, it really sucks, it’s scary, but you are a good dog owner who obviously pays attention. You’ll just pay attention even more for the rest of your life and that’s not a terrible thing. This happened to me n my dog, she got fleas from our apartment building, and because of that one incident I was very attentive and a few years later when we were camping I was able to detect ticks within hours, and then checked myself and got one off me before it even really attached.

So I fucking lost it by any means necessary. I’ve lost over 160 pounds to date despite even more health issues from my genetic condition. Even after becoming disabled and going from running 6km a day to needing a walker to get around. 
I cannot stand stereotypical fat girls who use every excuse and is covered in tattoos, piercings, and freaky coloured hair when she claims she just doesn’t want to date and guys find her intimidating, no biatch they find you stereotypical and boring and your friends hate you for using your disability money on tattoos and hair dye vs paying for therapy, a gym membership, and healthcare so you can get better. It’s very clear to all of us that you don’t want to get better. Your friends think you are childish, and you love being the object of pity.

Yeah, I’m still fucking morbidly obese, and disabled, and suffering violent ptsd, but it ain’t gunna stop me from loosing weight n being healthy for my best self, it’s never stopped me from anything I’ve ever wanted, I don’t give up when things get hard and I refuse to be lumped in with the likes of you and your need to be the centre of attention.

Also, I’m sick of my friends being so positive about my body image that it is toxic. Toxic positivity Leads to people like her, the stereotype who doesn’t want to get better because they feed off of everyone’s positivity. 
I’m a confident person, and I’m adamant in saying I have fat, not am fat.  Fat isn’t who I am, I have an excess of it and I’m getting rid of it, I don’t want to grow attachments to being complimented in ways that aren’t healthy. You don’t tell an Addict that you love the way they look when they are using. So why would you tell a food addict that they look great with all the fat/ the exact way they are. It’s not healthy. I don’t want people to encourage my addiction that I’m working so hard to overcome so don’t tell me I look great the way I am when I am talking about being healthier.

Because “Kenny told me I’m special and that he’ll do the right thing for me, he held my hand while saying it so it must be true”

We need to teach people how to think about the 3 truths. 
The truth of how this affects only yourself
The truth of how this affects the humans you care about/live near
And the truth of how this affects the rest of humanity

Most people can only think about the first two, but only care about the first one. They don’t teach you how to see all 3, and they certainly don’t teach you how to care for any of them really, they only teach you how to care about the company that is paying for the building you are in during the time you are learning how to care. They don’t want us to care and to see more than one truth because then they wouldn’t get away with this shit. Sadly the general popular isn’t intelligent enough to comprehend these things so they do get away with it. They get away with it because they really make the general population feel that they are these things already so they don’t go searching for them, they keep them comfortable in their comas of grand mediocracy and those people are lucky in times of good health because ignorance really is bliss. But they are waking up scared now, no one can be kept comfortable in an earthquake with such uncertainty. So which will we fear more, which will inspire us more, how will we teach people to think of more than one truth without depressing them to suicidal ideation because this shit is dark and scary and real and we have been taught to hide from confrontation of any kind but confrontation and messy feelings are exactly what the next few generations will live in.

autism,fpr0ay8,t1_fpqzo2i,1588837909.0,"Where I live you need a family dr to get anything done health related, but drs also have the right to fire patients..  because my disease causes chronic pain in extreme levels I have been denied care by 102 drs in the last year alone. 102 appointments that I had to show up for just to be told they refused to take me as a patient. 
Then I had a crack-pot dr who was all like “f the system I know better than them about everything” but if he actually did then he intentionally did harmful treatments to me sending me years forward in the progression of my disease. 
Now I’m stuck with a dr whos staff hates me, and she is kinda a stubborn capitalistic kiss ass. I joke and call myself a full time patient as my job because I can’t work and I typically have appointments every day of the week. 

I’d give anything to have a dr that cared let alone one that listened. Now we are only aloud to bring up one single thing per visit, so I’ll need one to two visits weekly to get anything done. I hate my life thanks to them."

dogs,fppulza,t3_gemwos,1588809469.0,"I fucking hate when my mom doesn’t respect my wishes for my dog. 
Her dog is over weight for a malamute, and he has my parents completely trained. He goes out the front door and in the side door for a treat, every hour. 

I have a miniature schnauzer, and I did 6 months of good research before I decided on a schnauzer for many many reasons. But knowing from the beginning that schnauzers at age 6 ish have a very high chance of getting pancreatic issues and dying from over weight has made me very very diligent on her training and food handling. 

When I got her I was running 6km a day, we were training for a long (3 month long) hike in mountain trails. It was amazing. Then my life went to shite and I became disabled with a very progressive condition. My dog is the best inspiration I need, all my physiotherapy exercises have been altered slightly so I can do them while giving her a work out too. I refused to train her with treats, she doesn’t get table scraps, occasionally I will pick a movie snack that I can “share” with her, for special occasions n such. I refuse to endanger her life in the long run just to make her happy now. But it’s so difficult to get my mom to listen n respect how I trained my dog. It only got through to her after she fed my dog something I told her not to due to stomach issues, and well, she had a leaky ass on my moms bed that night from it. I told her it would happen, she didn’t listen, I enjoyed my moms suffering but I was furious she made my pupper suffer in it too.

Recently I’ve been fainting a ton and have been going to the hospital for infusion treatments and am not able to do anything. I don’t really give a frack about myself, but my pupper, I’ll fight for her forever. My bro n neighbours have been incredible helping come take her for long walks and to the park. I feel like shit that I can’t give my girl the things she needs myself, but I’m so grateful that I have these people in my life who have stepped up to help me take care of the only thing I care about. 

Stand strong and hold your ground. Attend your next vet appointment with them to get the vet to tell your mom the same things because of course your mama listen to a vet and not her daughter but it’s not about pride it’s about making sure the animal has the best care in prime Conditions to thrive and live its best life in. Best of luck you are a good dog owner for fighting for your pups best life"

She had the baby, the marriage didn’t work, I eventually moved to her city. People know that they can call me if there are in a bad situation and I’ll drop everything to get them, well one night she called me and said she was in a bad situation and needed help. So I got in my truck n drove over to her place (it was like 11pm Already) and I get there and she walks out of the house laughing and smiling.

I asked her what was going on and she said she just wanted to hang out with a girlfriend... she came over and spent the night, and during the time she wanted to talk about Halloween. I was excited, her babies first Halloween and I was the godmother so I was thinking like group costume, nope, she wanted to ditch the baby and go full slutty for Halloween. After I dropped her off the next day I never spoke to her again. I know I shoulda done it sooner."
AskReddit,fpjbdbc,t3_gdile3,1588662473.0,"I was the maid of honour, and the bride wanted to make her own wedding cake, but had never made a 3 tier cake before, let alone a white cake with black damask piping on it. I knew it would fail horribly so before she came to me crying I had already set up a cake order as my wedding present to her. 
A few days before the wedding she called me bawling so I said I got it. 

At the wedding, which I drove 8 hours to be there, paid for a hotel for 3 nights before the wedding so I could help finish everything and do my MOH duties, she insisted I buy a new dress to be moh, so I did. Then the day of the wedding it was my shoes, so she picked out ones for me to buy and wear, okay what ever .... she then surprised me with saying she caved and let her other brides maids wear floor length black dresses (which was supposed to be only my thing, the length was my thing only or so I thought).

During the reception  I was standing with her and one of her nephews and the nephew starts ranting on about how bad the cake looks and how his mom could have done such a better job and saying things like “I hope you didn’t pay for that” and when I went to correct that ungrateful bastard that the cake looked beautiful, tasted great, and was probably expensive so don’t complain about something you didn’t pay for. She ended up yelling at me instead of standing up for the cake that I got her out of my non existent budget for HER wedding out of the kindness of my heart. 
Talk about awkward. Their marriage didn’t last 6 months, they only got married because she was pregnant and their marriage didn’t even last till after the baby was born lol. 

Another awkward thing was the day before the wedding her n I were driving around doing jobs when we started talking about the wedding night surprise.  I knew the groom got a themed hotel room for them to spend the night and I thought she would love it, I even knew the theme was Roman.  
So were chatting about all the excitement and she knows the hotel they are going to has theme rooms, so she states very matter of fact like that “he better not have gotten us a Roman theme room, like that’s just ridiculously tacky and I might have to walk away if he is that tacky”

Man did I have to bite my tongue, I did my best to say she was lucky he would go out of his way to do something nice and romantic for just the two of them on their wedding night and how I wished I had a guy who was so thoughtful” 
What I really wanted to say was listen here you ungrateful ct he’s put a lot of thought and care into planning this for you and you are going to complain about the freaking decor of the room?!

I couldn’t get her to pay up for the damages of the broken window, let alone the 3 feet of drywall all the way around her room that needed to be replaced, and the entire basement carpet that was brand new needed replacing also from the flooding.

Then she tried to steal one of my baking dishes, and started throwing things at me when I wouldn’t let her. I drew the line on my baking stuff, I freaking love to bake. This girl was such a Karen. So Christian she believed in waiting till marriage for sex, but every dirty thing over the pants was okay, and man she loved to do that kinda stuff and then cry to me about how she couldn’t find a man that would take her seriously.

 When I moved into a place after high school I moved in with my boyfriend and had a room mate lined up to move in closer to when uni was going to start. My boyfriend was great the year that I was at our hs, and he was in a different city going to uni, and it was fantastic when we moved in together at the start of summer before my first year of uni. But as time grew closer for school to start and more of his friends from the year before were coming back to the city for school it suddenly became clear that we weren’t allowed to touch or kiss outside the house. Then it was we weren’t supposed to hang out outside the house. Then our roomie moved in and she was in the music department with me, I thought it was great having a friend in the music department with me, we could practice together, I could talk to her about my boyfriend. 
Then he started hanging out with her too. 

Then right after midterms I wound up pregnant, at 17, with my boyfriend who was only my boyfriend in the house. I had to go in for surgery, and I didn’t tell anyone I was preg, I lost the baby of course. When I went to tell him about it all he didn’t even stop playing video games to talk to me he simply said “good, I’m glad” and kept playing. We didn’t talk much after that and things were basically over. 

Then I came to find out he was sleeping with our roommate, my friend in the music department with me. I don’t know if you know this about music departments but there isn’t a ton of people in the department. Well, everyone in the department took sides, they chose the girl who was my roomie and was sleeping with my boyfriend aka our other roomie. I was able to kick her out right away, with him it was a bit more complicated and he ended up staying another 6 months. 

6 months of hell. The two of them convinced everyone else in the music department of all these horrible things, and I was being bullied so constantly that one of our professors took me aside and said “look, I can’t do anything to stop them really. So I can only tell you that you would be better off to take a break from here and come back once they have graduated” and I tried to make it work, I finished that semester but after it just got SO bad with the bullying, and my antidepressants weren’t working, I had just had surgery so I was still recovering, and I was starting to experience the longer term affects of cptsd. I quit school for a while because I couldn’t do it anymore, I tried to take my life several times during the last few months that the ex was still living with me. I cannot fathom why he didn’t move out right away too, the house was my families so there was no “taking over the lease” stuff,  I honestly think he was just such a sick bastard that he enjoyed putting me in such a horrible spot. Having that power over me."
PMDD,fpj5wih,t1_fpj5bs1,1588657524.0,"Having her in my support group is really complicated, she is a really great support sometimes, especially in emergencies not relating to mental health. She also is the only reason I’m not homeless, I’m disabled with a very progressive disease and disability where I live isn’t enough to cover rent let alone any of the therapies I need for my health, she covers the rest and some more giving me a really comfortable life. She’s not stupid but sometimes she can say really stupid things.  She’s not emotionally intelligent like I am. 
There is an equal amount if not slightly more good about her and our relationship than there is bad. The bad just hits me in the face sometimes when she doesn’t get how choice of words can make or break someone.

My mom has (not nearly this bad) but similar issue, so once she commented on two girls holding hands in the mall and I stopped her right there and loudly explained how awesome it was that people are so free here to be happy and that those two found a way to be happy and how much I know my mom believes that we should be happy in life.

Where as by the time I met these people in high school I had just run away from home to get a better education and escape the death and drugs of my home town. I was 15 and I was tired of burying friends already.

Those words, emotional whiplash... it makes me feel disgusting inside because knowing my existence makes people uncomfortable is so difficult. I either make them uncomfortable morally because I stood up to the guy who raped me and the police deemed the case not worthy to pursue. Or I make them uncomfortable because of mortality being recently diagnosed with a untreatable, highly progressive, highly painful disease with an extreme list of complications. 

I hate myself so much because all I do is make people uncomfortable, and the only thing I want in life is to be comfortable. Screw happy, screw healthy, wealthy or what ever. I’d give up everything just to feel comfortable without pain for a month or a week even.

I’ve had a very hard time controlling my MCAS on my own and my pmdd makes it almost impossible to control. Oh those days I’m so swollen from everything that I avoid eating at all instead I got for a super high protein drink with minimal sugars. 

Controlling my diet is like playing mine sweeper though.
-I’ve had a full gastric bypass. 
- my bypass triggered a rare nausea side effect which makes cooking and eating in the same night nearly impossible.
-I have diagnosed POTS
-diagnosed and treating high blood pressure
-diagnosed and receiving iron infusions 
- deathly allergic to garlic, sage, red onions, and kiwi. 
- Environmental allergies to everything else that grows outside.
- and abdominal migraines 

I honestly don’t know what the frack to do, I’ve always struggled with binge eating and now it’s constant picking at food, I had lost 160 pounds, well I’ve gained 60 pounds back because of all of the issues + severe depression. Like if no dr going to care enough to treat me then why should I care because I will die without their intervention help so I’m just gunna enjoy what I can and that is food.

On a side note my dog learned how to detect my MCAS anaphylactic attacks and has alerted me 8 times which has saved my life by giving me enough time to get my epi pens. She’s such a great pupper. She’s curled up at my legs sleeping now.

Second side note,  if you don’t have one I EXTREMELY suggest getting a bed that moves head and feet, especially if you suffer from post Nasil drip due to the allergy symptoms. I went from having 20 sinus infections a year down to 2 infections a year instantly just because they could drain properly. This bed makes so many things better.

For me I always turn inward with my anger, with my pmdd I always end up self harming in one way or another always pretty serious though. I finally stopped cutting myself though after I found out about my Ehlers Danlos. 
With my ED and my long list of diseases stemming from that issue it’s unlikely I’ll live another 5 years which means relief to me but I know I can’t say that to most people. I’m hoping the hysterectomy will change something, anything at this point would help. 

I just can’t believe my lady drs office canceled my last check list apt and now refuses to call me back for some reason. I was SO close to having that last okay for surgery being booked and then BAM it’s canceled an hour before the apt was supposed to take place. I’ve been waiting 10 years to even have them consider saying yes to this. I’m more than pissed. 

I believe in those who are transitioning and every difficulty around that but I do not agree with the fact that I medically need a hysterectomy but have to fight relentlessly to get one but my student who is transitioning was able to get one by the time he was 18. It just fracking makes me mad that I have to suffer agonizing hardships without consideration and he got all the consideration and treatment without medically needing it done ASAP.

The first year after finding out everyone was extremely supportive, people come around lots, ask if you need help, want to spend time with you. 

Then...

Then they realize you aren’t dying fast enough, that it isn’t like tv and you don’t die within a weekly episode and that the time you have to wait in between is the most difficult. So they leave you.

I am also a survivor of rape and childhood abuse, so before all this started sometimes people couldn’t handle being my friend simply because they couldn’t and didn’t want to fathom what it took for me to get to the great place I was in. How I fought for myself to live on my own at 15 and escape the abuse all so I could get a better education, and I got a great one while having a great attitude. Then I was living a great life when I was raped by someone I knew. Then I started to overcome that when I was diagnosed. 

Now, people end up feeling really uncomfortable once they get to know me because I either remind them for their morality  or their mortality. 
I’m not mad at them, I wish they could empathize better but when I think about it we only really understand if we go through it then I’m glad that they’ve never gone through it. It gives me hope that people can live without trauma guiding them, that’s something I guess. I’m really passionate about living, the possibilities and the endless opportunities around us. I work really hard not to let my mental health consume my life, ever since I was really little I had a feeling I wasn’t meant to grow old like everyone else but that I was meant to truly live more than others, it guided me through some of the most unspeakable horrors and although I’m sad from the amount of pain I’m in and abuse I suffer at the hands of corporate medicine not understanding or caring about quality of life vs longevity, I have a great life and I have so many moments of happiness and love. 


Like right now my dog is curled up beside my stomach with her head on my stomach snoring away, and all I can think is how lucky I am to be right here right now with a creature that knows love.

Life is gunna happen, and I’m not gunna tell you not to be anxious because I’m always anxious.  My only unsolicited advice is that in spite of your anxiety you should push yourself to step out of you comfort zone to live. I truly believe life begins at the end of our comfort zone.  That idea alone has pushed me to do and be incredible things that I never thought possible considering where I came from. 
I feel a shit ton of anxiety all the time, but I do it anyways because then I will know if the anxiety was warranted or not.

My brother died when I was young also, and one thing I like to think is that when I see him again someday I want to be able to tell him that I lived a little extra for him every day, and mean it when I say it. He wouldn’t have wanted me to miss out on life, so it’s honestly the best thing I could do for myself was to push hard through my anxiety by saying I’ll tell him about it someday and we will laugh or not laugh, but I’ll get to say I did it."

My room is technically a “den” so it has 2 doors, one of the doors I have blocked by my make up desk but it’s open so there is space under it for the dog to get out, so when I close the main door she still can get out of my room to go get a drink n stuff. She is GREAT at pretending she’s stuck so I will come fix things and then she’ll sneak through her door so she can take my spot on the bed. 

Oh to be a dog!"

lampwork,fp71d61,t1_fp6wisf,1588362271.0,"Most of the borosilicate glass workers I know work in shops together so they can share expenses and kilns therefor their major expenses starting are torch, tools, and product. Because I do much smaller scale glass work I have my own home studio, my entire set up (ventilation, torch, tanks,  and kiln) cost around 800$ Canadian, this’s was built up over time upgrading from small shitty second hand things. Not including glass or extra tools. My kiln was the biggest expense being 450$. However a big glass working torch for large boro work usually starts around 400+ but you could probably find one second hand that would do. 
Another expense often over looked is the continued need to fill the oxygen n propane tanks. For my tiny set up it’s around 60 a month in total. I imagine it is a lot more for big torches. 

One major thing I forgot to add was ventilation, don’t work without it."
lampwork,fp5e8jt,t3_gberdm,1588326090.0,"Welcome!! Glass working is SO addicting and wonderful. I suggest starting by looking up the safety stuff and getting to know the materials you will be working with. 
I use both soft glass (coe104) and borosilicate (coe33) but I make pendants and smaller things. Most likely you will only use borosilicate glass with what you want to do, it’s fantastic stuff. 
Obviously besides watching YouTube stuff this is a great sub to get you going. Glass workers are some of the most friendly artists I’ve ever met and I do a large amount of mediums for art. 

Obviously, you’ll want to get a torch, but with that you will need regulators, oxygen and propane (or other gas) tanks, a good fire extinguisher, and a kiln. 

Tools for glass working can come from pretty much anywhere. I use tools for glass that I have for doing manicures, I use tools from my leather working days, jewelry pliers and so on. Just so many fun options. 

I hope this is enough to get you started down the rabbit hole, oh and Instagram is fracking awesome for glass working inspiration like omg. Good luck and don’t blow up!"

No one needs a haircut, that’s totally insane. And no one needs a decorative manicure, BUT there are manicure/pedicure treatments that are for health related things. I never used to think twice about my feet, just cut my nails and they’d be fine, recently I became disabled and walking has become very difficult and I realized that if I don’t give myself a pedicure to keep calluses down/ nails trimmed / general good foot health then it makes walking extremely painful. I am super lucky that I can reach my feet, many people cannot do so. I don’t think nail parlours should open back up but I do think that podiatrists should idk maybe hire a nail tech to help with this painful upkeep to keep people healthy/ in minimal pain. 

Getting gel nails because you’re bored? You are a douche canoe. Getting things taken care of for physical pain reasons? If you have too I guess."

If you say something enough times even you begin to believe it yourself. It’s gut wrenching and incredibly difficult to let that reality set in that the general population is just being hit with the same type of misinformation in such large doses that they believe it to be truth and the only truth out there."
Anxiety,foy3tsc,t1_foy2hts,1588164647.0,"I agree it’s not the worst to have an emergency stash, honestly I having been saving them up for the last year because I was supposed to go on my last bucket list trip before my disease progresses further and I can no longer fly. I was supposed to leave May 16th for two months in England/Scotland by myself, so I was saving them up for that since I wouldn’t have real access to medical care there... 

idk I just feel so anxious since doing the math an hour ago like now that I did the math I have no plausible deniability and I’ll get caught and have the prescription taken away permanently but I wanted reassurance that this might been the severe anxiety talking and not reasonable logistics. 
I’m super relieved to know I’m not the only one who does this but I’m also super sorry that you have to go through this horrid uncertainty also... I honestly get why some people can seem like they’re addicted because the uncertainty alone can make me say crazy things and I have to be super careful when talking to a medical professional.. 

I use a pain advocacy group sometimes to help “coach” me into what language I should use when talking to drs to get my point across without coming across as unhinged... I really hate the system for putting me in this position in the first place. For causing me to have night terrors and panic attacks over simple procedures and appointments. 

Some people say talking to me is like emotional whiplash because the things I consider normal are SO not normal to anyone else and they can’t believe I’m taking about the abuse I have to go through like it’s just another Monday. I call myself a full time patient because of all the appointments I normally attend so that I don’t let my illness get the best of me, if drs had their way I wouldn’t see anyone and I’d go die in a corner like they want, but I want to live and to do that I have to be my own advocate, my own support, my own everything. I left home when I was 15 so I could go to a city to get a better education, I never thought that my legal education would only be used to advocate for myself so I wouldn’t slip through the cracks. There is so much wasted potential in me because the system refuses to understand or treat genetic/autoimmune diseases properly. I’m sure you agree.. thank you kind stranger ❤️"
raisedbynarcissists,foxwsu0,t3_g9wfcd,1588158943.0,"Holy fuck yes.
My brother sexually abused me when we were young, but I’ve managed to forgive him because he was only 6 years old and found dads skin mags, I was younger than him and around, removing the immediate emotion of relation from the factor and honestly how can you be mad at a curious 6 year old. I know it messed him up just as much as me, in my opinion we are both trauma survivors and have to deal with it. However, any time I try talk to my mom or she wants me to talk about why I am the way I am she gets super upset at me because she can’t cope with the fact it happened and technically her golden boy was the abuser in that moment, no matter what I say she can’t separate the fact that I had trauma from who caused the trauma. 
There is a difference between getting over who caused the trauma and being able to get over the trauma itself. She just gets so upset so fast and tries to invalidate my emotions at such a huge level. I think maybe it’s also to do with the fact if she admits there was trauma to begin with then she has to accept some of the responsibility that her 6 year old did that to her 4 year old. Gods forbid she be responsible for being negligent enough to cause such severe childhood trauma in her kids."
CPTSD,foxvrvh,t3_ga2oo8,1588157968.0,"I’m disabled and have a very progressive genetic disease and yeah, quarantine is exactly like my every day life for the last 4 years. At first I was honestly really excited/majorly relieved because FINALLY people would have a taste of how hard it is and maybe they would be a bit more understanding why I get depressed when they forget to invite me out with them. Because forcing yourself to go out and do the stuff is really difficult and a huge task to do when you struggle with your mental and physical health constantly. However as it’s gone on people haven’t been more understanding because they have been wallowing in their own bad mental health and I’ve been trying my best to step up and remind them to be kind to themselves and how difficult it is to not be able to have your coping mechanisms for your mental health (ex hanging out with friends, going out every night) 
So from a pro at this and maintaining a balance for your health, you just gotta be kind on yourself but be firm. You NEED to have a few checklists in your life to keep your mental and physical health at optimum. I’m not saying to keep you happy and the perfect citizen, I’m saying you keep these lists so that even if your mental health is bad one day you are still doing the optimal things to create success for your future self and/or to at minimum keep yourself from spiralling into an unexpected deep issue that could damage your current job/friends/relationships/physical health 

You can ignore the rest of my comment if you already have a checklist, but this is what I go through in my mind every time something goes askew so that even if I’m not okay in the moment I am making sure my future self has a better chance at being okay faster. Best of luck now and in future, I hope that you can see what you need to change and be able to make the changes for your future selfs best chances.
Here’s my personal checklist. Usually it’s in the top 3 that is the issue and I can correct it.
- have I been sleeping. (Most important thing in all types of health.)
- have I been eating enough
- have I been socializing enough
- am I taking my medication properly.
- when was the last time you showered/ personal hygiene 
- have I left the house to socialize lately (I know this doesn’t apply right now but still important to consider and drill into your mind so when something is off, you automatically go through the list to try correct it quickly without spiral)
- has there been unusual amount of stress at home, work, family, friends.
- have I been reaching out to proper supports (health care team, therapist included)"

narcissisticparents,fortrdd,t3_g90fn8,1588018366.0,"I have felt a lot less guilty about standing up to my Nmom since joining this. I’m disabled and don’t work but my disability doesn’t cover my expenses so my mom is taking care of me financially, I didn’t think I had any right to say anything because how dare I shit on her when she does something so amazing for me. But I deserve to be treated with normal levels of respect, I deserve basic rights as a human and even though I live because of her money I don’t actually live with her and therefor she has no right to dictate what furnishings and art my apartment should have, who I talk to or what I’m saying to them. 
I don’t fear for my well being anymore, I feel strong enough to know that I will be okay because I am okay, my world isn’t what she says the world is. She is grossly misinformed about what the world is and tries to spread it on me. She also tries so hard to invalidate my feelings as victim of childhood sexual trauma because my brother was the abuser, she doesn’t realize that I’m not blaming him (he was 6 years old, what happened was a product of our environment and not of him as a being.) just because I’m not blaming him doesn’t mean it didn’t frack me up badly, doesn’t mean I don’t have to work through the trauma it caused. But it’s like because he is also her child she has to invalidate my trauma so that it isn’t his fault. Her emotional understanding is that of a teenager and it’s exhausting having to try to tell her that just because you don’t hate or blame someone for causing trauma doesn’t mean there isn’t trauma you have to work through.

AskReddit,fnvcq4o,t3_g3xrji,1587288354.0,"My high school choir teacher hands down. 
I was a 15 year old that ran away from home so I could go to a big city school and get an education that would get me into university. I took choir because I loved music, but it became very evident that my choir teacher would make my life hell after I chose to peruse music full time. 

I was/am a talented natural soprano, but I am very fat and in high school I was very goth/metal. As in cameo pants, band hoodies always, tons of piercings, black or coloured hair, a fight first person because until I ran away I was literally fighting for my life against sexual, physical and mental abuse daily. My choir class was all upscale rich girls who’s families had money for lessons and all of the skinny girls were also in the teachers musical theatre classes.


Due to my looks I never once got a solo, even though I was the most advanced singer and the most powerful in the choir. It was a standing bet that I’d pay any singer who could sing louder than me while doing it properly. The teacher also knew it was my dream to sing the solo of a very specific choir piece, and I begged him for 2 years to run that piece. In grade 12 he did and insisted I wasn’t ready for a solo. Due to the incompetence of the singer he gave the solo too we lost our completion that year. To make things worse when we started learning said piece he moved me from my soprano section down to altos, the most boring and unchallenging section. 


In our grade 12 year it was tradition that when the choir sing at the grad ceremony a grade 12 student conduct the performance , I was promised the opportunity to conduct, but not only that I was writing out a choir piece for 4 part harmony and 6 piece band accompaniment. After informing my teacher I was going on vacation for a week, and going on said vacation I came back to find out I had been replaced as conductor AND he then refused to listen to the piece I wrote. He did all this in front of the class and all the girls laughed at me.

I could go on and on about how he singled me out, belittled me and tried to crush my voice because he didn’t like that I was fat. His choir was all about the image and nothing about the sound. 
Happy note, I went on to sing opera in university music as I doubled on instrumental (trombone) and voice studies. A great FU to him."
