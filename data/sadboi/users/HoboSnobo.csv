Correction. Yes my therapist knows, my psychiatrist only knows bare bones because I don‚Äôt talk to him much, and am currently being treated for bipolar.

So it plays a VERY big part in our life, and helps keep the bad man voices and intrusive thoughts at bay.

Rereading the messages Dave sent, he had a great time until he realized he couldn‚Äôt hear or feel me. Then he started freaking the fuck out (which is not the usual for him.

Apparently Dave isn‚Äôt a strong willed as we both thought. And it would have been disastrous. If I hadn‚Äôt have woken up in the body this morning (by accident, mind you) I don‚Äôt know what he would have done.

I‚Äôm not sure on her age yet.
She‚Äôs a guardian angel to me. And I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve loved my whole life without knowing if her existence till a month or so ago."
DID,fmoa7jw,t1_fmoa571,1586251316.0,AHHHH. Okay. That makes more sense. I was confused as to why I would move this to an ‚Äúasking‚Äù thread. Hahahaha
DID,fmoa2bj,t1_fmo9trw,1586251157.0,"Sure, I can move it there, but just so I know for the future, which guideline does this not follow?"
DID,fmnr6v9,t1_fmnqwc2,1586233027.0,"Thanks! I will definitely keep you in mind! I‚Äôll pm you, just so I don‚Äôt forget who you are. Hahahahah"
DID,fmnqn02,t1_fmnqejc,1586232603.0,"I feel like that‚Äôs my life. I love to write. Poetry, plays, word vomit, even some role play. But it always seems to be half finished. Or it finishes itself from someone else, and then I get upset because I didn‚Äôt think of it, or it‚Äôs not exactly how I wanted it to be. *sigh* So I kinda stopped doing it. But this was really bothering me, and I felt like it needed to come out. So poetry it was."
CPTSD,fmnqequ,t1_fmnq34j,1586232427.0,"It definitely did. I mean, there are parts of what I‚Äôm going through that don‚Äôt 100% match up with this, but it‚Äôs pretty damn close."
DID,fmnqaho,t1_fmnptkn,1586232338.0,"To be completely honest, I only wrote half of this. Hahaha. I know what I wanted to say, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out the second half. But I looked down and I realized it was already finished before I could figure it out. Haha."
