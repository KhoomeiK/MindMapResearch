PTSDHumor,fnwt5z4,t3_foz0kq,1587324947.0,"Cigarette Daydreams — I played it on repeat from sophomore to senior year of high school because I really felt like the girl who always had to run from everything because there was literally emotional and physical threats ever corner i turned. I wanted someone to care enough about me to want to help who also knew what to say. All the adults would ignore my cries for help and all the people my age who cared didn’t know how to be there because we were kids and kids shouldn’t be exposed to those things. The fact that sexual misconduct was a central part of my life made me different and hated by many because there was something wrong with me and people could see. Part of me resents everyone for being so judge mental in high school, and the other part of my feels so guilty for being so overbearing and off putting to those who tried to help. I totally turned people away and now a bunch of people will go their whole lives thinking I’m batshit insane when really I was just a child who didn’t have access to any means of mental rehabilitation despite being painfully self aware of how much she needed it. 

I’m 20 now and I can say with conviction that I’ve never been what people would consider “okay.” I would love to know what it’s like to be a happy person that isn’t suffering every day. I hope I can get there. I’m trying. I promise. 

My life is still absolute fucking torture but it IS better these days.  I’m stuck living with my abusers during quarantine (which means that 99% of the socialization that my I get has to be from them so I’m so fucking lonely dude) instead of away at college where I am free to be who I am.  Every day is torture. But the difference is I’ve tasted freedom now. I’ve tasted joy. I’ve fallen in platonic AND romantic love many times over and I’ve grown from what all this loving has taught me. 

Idk what I’m trying to say here. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t contemplate ending my life within the last hour. But I am fighting. I am fighting for my younger self who had nobody to protect her and stand up to those horrible predators who did everything they could to make a sweet little girl no longer innocent. And it worked. I’m not innocent, and I haven’t been for a very long time. But I’m still here. And god, I hope that one day I can listen to Cigarette Daydreams and not focus on the pain in the lyrics. 

I hope one day I can listen to the core message, which is that you will never find the answer to the question “why did this happen to me?” no matter how hard you look, but you can decide to stay in this world and heal. And if I don’t get killed or kill myself (the likelihood is slowly lowering over time), maybe I can help save other and spread this message one day. 

Idk man you caught me in a rl emotional mood. These times are strange. I’m glad that I forced myself to turn this comment into a positive one."

PCOS,flpozkr,t1_fk785ek,1585364905.0,"There’s something called non diabetic hypoglycemia. It’s rare, but it exists and many professionals I’ve spoken to don’t know about it and genuinely don’t believe me when I tell them what I have. 

According to the doctor who I met with a few months back, it will only show up on a blood test if you have the type of hypo that comes with diabetes. I don’t know a lot about it but I do know that it exists. In order to test for it, you’d have to meet with an endo and get a different type of test done. I am yet to meet with an endo myself but I plan to as soon as the virus is less of a problem. 

:)

If you have any questions feel free to ask! I urge you to also look into non diabetic hypoglycemia yourself as it’s worth it for the sake of reassurance!"

PCOSloseit,fkg4akf,t3_fbhx3a,1584149585.0,"I’m at a healthy weight but if I lose 10 more lbs of body fat I would say that would make me look really in shape.... and that is definitely a stomach shape I have too, except for the back fat thing (unless I just don’t notice it? I’m not entirely sure what you mean by the back fat thing anyway). Uhhh what I can say is that I dress for my body shape. I’m an inverted triangle (my upper body is broader than my lower body) which honestly SUCKS because even at the weight I am, if I don’t adhere to a very strict rules, I look manly and big. However, with doing a lot of research, I’ve not only figured out the ins and outs of my body type, but I’ve also figured out how to dress to flatter. Sounds like you’re not an inverted triangle since you described a proportional lower body, but I would suggest looking at dress tips for the inverted triangle as well as your body type because it might give you a better idea of how to play up certain features to draw attention away from things you find less favorable. 

I’ve gotten good at this to a point that sometimes people don’t even realize that my proportions are so uneven. 

In the mean time, I’m out here being kind to myself even though my shape and my weight is a cause of so much pain and frustration. I’m mainly typing this to remind myself, but hopefully it helps someone else, but: whether you have a feature that you feel is unsavory by societal standards or not, you  are just as deserving of respect. You shouldn’t be left out of some specific club just because you look a certain way. You are entitled to respect. Don’t ever let someone speak to you differently because they think the way you look is cause to knock you down a peg.

Also!!! As you lose weight, it gets less noticeable!! I’m about 7 lbs lighter than I was a year ago and the rib cage stomach fat has shrunk quite a bit. It sucks cuz our body type is just the type that will store it there so no matter how healthy we get, it might always be there, but hey, that’s ok!"

I plan on speaking to my therapist about my whole situation with my parents the next time because it honestly just keeps developing and changing into different versions of terrible as time goes on. Hopefully I’ll be able to forgive without having the manipulative voice of my parents in my head telling me I’m being unfair by not treating them like they’re normal parents who have done nothing wrong.

I used fasting in the sense that I woke up and then didn’t eat breakfast. I went straight to the doctor to get my blood work done. But that’s when it’s the worst so it was very hard getting to the doctor!

It’s really hard to stand my ground here because I’m quite prone to chalking things up as me being crazy, but freshman year of college I was brushing my teeth in the morning when all of the sudden a wave of whatever health problem I have flooded over me and I was freaking out and screaming “I’ve gotta lie down” and last thing I remember is me lying down in the dirty shower and this girl was telling me I can’t lie down in there but I wanted to do anything to get closer to the ground, and then it goes black (not sure if I fainted) and then all of the sudden I was fine and got up. I have severe anxiety, and that’s not what happens when I get anxiety. That is a PROBLEM. I am not crazy! And the fact that that girl never looked at me the same after that is pretty damn good proof 😂

And yeah man my parents are the worst! Thank you for recommending the forum. I don’t think they necessarily had a cluster b disorder, but they have been very neglectful and have put me in many unsafe situations in my life, aside from the health problems. Honestly feels real good to have someone else validate it. Figured I’d mention that I don’t intend to perpetuate the cycle and the more my lil bro matures, the more faith I have that he won’t either! Currently in therapy trying to work through all of the bs, and hopefully I’ll eventually be financially independent so I don’t have to answer to them anymore! 

I will look up idiopathic postprandial syndrome and as soon as possible, get tested, along with hyperinsulinemia and the other recommendation that had been made thus far! Thank you for your help!

Also—what percentage of doctors are good? I know they’re out there and I’m not trying to be snarky by saying that.  The doctor I had throughout my adolescence never once mentioned PCOS. She just kept pressuring me to take acne meds and told me “it looks so horrible” when I was clearly in a place where I wanted to accept myself for who I was. 
The next doc diagnosed me with PCOS, but she was the one who mentioned that she didn’t want to go through the effort of measuring my blood sugar and she had no advice for how to cope with PCOS. Then the most recent one. Like... how do I find an actual good doctor?"

My gut is telling me to get tested for hyperinsulinemia just in case because idk if it’s PCOS causing this or not. 
I limit my carbs and make sure that most of what I’m eating comes from proteins and fats most of the time, and I’m working on minimizing sugar intake. It’s very difficult for me because I eat food from a dining plan at school and it’s very limited. This stuff helps but honestly, when it’s really bad in the morning, the only thing that helps is eating sugar and carbs. I’ll eat a meal and feel horrid 20 minutes later and then have to eat a bag of chips, and it won’t even be 11am. 
Seeing the gyn is the next step. I’m trying to do this stuff all step by step cuz it’s new to me and honestly really scary given the anxiety I have now, but I’m determined."

Very paranoid and afraid of physical touch sorta deal. This summer was the first time I held hands with someone without having a breakdown after it happened. I know for a lot of people holding hands isn’t a big deal, but it’s a huuuuge step for me. 

I also had my heart broken at 17. I do believe I loved this person. And yeah, I mean I definitely love the guy from this summer way more, but I don’t really want to ever see my first heartbreak as minuscule. Maybe when compared to a true loving relationship it is for sure, but I think that these experiences are super important and I feel like although it exists in varying degrees, the very existence of love is special. But I do admit that even though my love for these 2 people has been strong, I don’t really understand the love that comes along with a healthy relationship and a lasting stable bond. That will probably change he way I view these last 2 lives for sure. Time will tell!

I have faith that one day I’ll love someone leaps and bounds more than I love this boy. In this moment, the thought of that makes me feel icky but if my past experiences have taught me anything, that changes.  I appreciate the sentiment about this changing.

There was never a movement where he felt unsafe of disrespected. Yeah he was a dick to me at moments, but that doesn’t mean that he wasn’t a remarkable individual. He just has a lot of growing up to do. I was hoping to be alongside him as he grew up to become a man, but that’s not an option. I just want him to be alright.

I learned so much from loving him. And idk after seeing that picture today, all of the bad things he did just keep running through my head. I think I’m getting better at seeing him for who he is, and honestly, he didn’t deserve me.

He was a deeply flawed person with some red flags. And I’m so glad I didn’t ignore the red flags. I stuck up for myself and I stuck to my guns. I was never inauthentic to my beliefs and desires. 

Dude, my first kiss is gonna be with some really wonderful dude. And I know that cuz homie is gonna have to jump through HELLA hoops before he gets to that stage. I can’t wait to grow and expand. Maybe this wake up call is good, somehow. Not a fan of the image of another girl kissing his check being burned into my brain, but maybe this is all good. 

I was on the right path before he came around, and I still am. ❤️😊"
MentalHealthSupport,f775y7u,t1_f774k5p,1573444906.0,"Thank you so much. All you’ve said is right. It’s always hurt to feel love from others since it’s been so sparse. I used to run away from it or numb the pain that came when someone tried to give me love (platonic or romantic), or even just flirt with me. But when he came into my life, I was forced to let it in. That’s why this one hits deep. The first time, I couldn’t bring myself to do it, but there I was, my first date with this boy this summer, and I had my head in his lap as he stroked my hair and all I was thinking was “How am I not terrified?” 

I think remembering the good hurts quite a bit right now. It stopped hurting for the last few weeks, but seeing that picture tonight fucked everything up. I was close to moving forward but then that picture.... ugh it ruined my vibe man!!! I was having such a good night! 

Since he’s come around though, I still feel difficulty letting the love in, but I’m better at forcing myself to accept it now. I rarely result to numbing the pain, whereas before I met him, it was constant and I saw no end to that toxic behavior. 

Since he broke my heart, it’s started to hurt again to accept love, but this time around, I force myself to feel it anyway. I don’t let myself self-sabotage as a means of trying to make myself unappealing and broken. These days I just do what is best for me. And I’ll always remember. Maybe he’ll forget what was between us, or maybe he won’t. I need to be okay with either one. I need to be okay with myself."
MentalHealthSupport,f775e18,t1_f774bpd,1573444446.0,"Thank you so much for this. Ugh there’s something about being called hun that is so comforting lol!!! You’re right. 

We had a whole dialogue about what went down between us, and hopefully he has gotten professional help like I suggested or at least figured out a way through work through his avoidant attachment style. 

I told him that I would never chase him, and I stuck to my guns. It’s easy for me to hate myself for how it all went down, but I was so calm, composed, and mature the whole time. I was graceful and kind to him, but also I pulled the plug as soon as a toxic pattern began. 

He was in my life for a month. Long enough to love him but not long enough for life to catch up with the feelings we had for each other. Feels like so many things will always be unsaid. 

I told him that he’s in danger of doing this to other girls and hurting them the way he did to me. I really hope that woke him up. Seemed like he felt horrible about what he did and while he owned up to what he did, he never once said “I’m sorry.” He’s very self aware and knows what he did and what he has to fix, but I don’t know if he’s done anything about it. 

I’m so jealous of that girl in the photo. I find myself going back and forth between “my face is prettier,” “is she skinnier than me?” And all the likes. But then I think about her. Like, REALLY think about her. And I just want her to be happy. I hope that he treats her well. I hope they’re both happy. Genuinely. This is what love is about. 

And in regards to me, maybe I should focus on that more. Every second of every day I focus on the next step I can take towards recovering from the abuse that I’ve endured and the mental illness that has come as a result. This boy was a step along the way. A step that I’m reluctant to leave behind but I have to. 

And you’re right. It’s been a bit over 3 months since it ended, and it’s already gotten much better. I can’t wait to heal from this and be able to fully move forward. 

Still miss him though. Heaps and heaps and heaps like my gosh I’ll love that boy for as long as I live. But it will be a different love one day. He’ll never know how much he means to me!! I suppose he doesn’t deserve to though. 

Tomorrow I’ll put on a nice outfit and maybe do makeup if I want to :) I also have therapy tomorrow (PRAISE BE). Thank you for your encouragement. Your words have been so comforting."

Well I’m glad to have helped you feel some comfort. You really don’t deserve it feel ashamed of this. Please be kind to yourself. ❤️"

I’m very early on in my journey with OCD and am definitely not the one to ask for help but I just wanna say that it was extremely comforting to go onto this subreddit and read your words. We aren’t alone, and it’s not just all in our head. Someone else gets it too. It makes me feel like my OCD is valid. I hope this helps you feel the same way."

I don’t think those self harm alternatives will work for me. In my mind, I classify any sort of pain inflicting as self harm and I think it would only Trigger me further, but thank you anyway! 

I like your other suggestions a lot though!

I’ll definitely communicate to her how I’m feeling in an understanding way. :)"

It’s funny because I realized recently that the music I listen to can really imp g my mood.

And yes, hopefully I can meet up with her eventually! I wish I had her mom’s number. Her mom and I always got along well and she always appreciated me  putting in the extra effort to look out for her daughter while I was in high school. It’s sad that all I had to do to become adored by a mother is to try to include her daughter in social events from time to time, help her daughter stay on track when she was confused, and treat her like everyone else. Anyway, I was thinking it would be good to get her mom’s info so she could maybe remind her daughter and help her get there and back!"

Most of the people I kept in touch with from high school were the special ed kids, and I also have s few friends with autism as well! The special Ed kids were often the only people who weren’t rude, immature, or judgement, so I’m glad that I chose my friends wisely!

ptsd,ep0u6if,t1_ep0p8ym,1558980506.0,"Yes!! They’re called “thought stopping methods.” It’s really hard work at first, but over time, I’ve been told that if you do them enough, the intrusive thoughts will lesson. So while t is true that in the moment, you can’t control your intrusive thoughts, you can lessen them over time. However, I’ve definitely not received any drastic results yet. However it has helped me stop being bombarded by thoughts a little bit in the short term!"
ptsd,eozob9n,t1_eoyuthr,1558963904.0,"That’s s really creative idea in regards to the palettes. Unfortunately, with OCD, not giving into your compulsions causes anxiety, and also giving into your compulsions causes anxiety. If I did something else like making searches, it might just be more triggering. I’m better off doing something called thought stopping methods, which are tricks that help you stop receiving your intrusive thoughts. But that was a good suggestion! 

And I’ve tried to speak on the rainn hotline before, but they took so long to answer and I wasn’t able to stay on the line for that long. Is their hotline focused on helping you cope, or is it simply for referring you to outside resources for help? 

Thank you for taking the time to comment!"
