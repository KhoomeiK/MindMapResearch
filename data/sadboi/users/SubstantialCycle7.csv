CPTSD,fqowixu,t3_gk39y5,1589527024.0,"My parents financially supported me for the most part. At the very least I always had food, even if I did have to scrounge in the kitchen sometimes because they had forgotten to go shopping for weeks -_-. They got me presents at birthdays and these days they will spend money on me in a heartbeat. Problem is with my parents atleast. Money is a trap. If they give me money they can now claim they are good people and that gives them some kinda right to act how they want to me. It gives them power over me and I have learnt to turn their offers of money down these days.

Also have many friends who are in similar situations. I mean one of my best friends father kicked her out the house but now buys her to expensive presents (and then expects things in return).

I think emotional neglect is hard to quantify. Especially in a society where capitalism is king. But people financially supporting you does not mean that they did not abuse you. Emotional neglect greatly affects self worth, and how you grow up as an adult and no amount of money can replace that."

ChronicIllness,fqlf7pw,t3_gj41sp,1589456383.0,"Fear of losing my job and ending up dependant on someone else. I know that has already happened for alot of people on here and it's less than ideal. I am good at my job and enjoy it and the idea of me losing it and my own autonomy freaks me out alot. I also grew up in an abusive family and I don't want to go back there again. I need to be able to stand on my own two feet (somehow). 

Also being a good partner to someone when you are chronically ill can be hard. I need to remember I deserve reassurance and kindness but also not to smother my partners needs or put mine above theirs because I am having a bad day. It's really hard sometimes to not get angry they are not picking up your slack when you can't do something, but I need to remember that me being ill is hard on them too and both of us need to work together to make this work. A relationship cannot be entirely one sided.

autism,fqhyf6d,t3_gj1kto,1589386754.0,"Everyone's autism is different. Young children can want physical attention etc. And still be autistic! Autism is about a lack of social understanding and an inability to instinctually pick it up from those around you.

I loved hugs as I like being tightly compressed it is just a physical sensation I really like. I don't like them from strangers and other people exhaust me quickly but yeh I like physical affection from specific people.

I hated the food thing, the portioning. My mum used to hide stashes of snacks around the house because she didn't trust us not to eat them all. I wasn't allowed any food between meals and was always criticised for eating too much etc. Used to get yelled at for eating fruit because it was expensive. Made me so angry my sister and I had eating disorders and my parents didn't know and my sister hadn't eaten in days, I was trying to get her to eat and my mum comes in and tells us off for eating anything.

Formula is impossible to remember, graphs make my eyes blur and urgh. I spent a year doing addition and subtraction every day and still little to no improvement. Many people say it's because I haven't tried hard enough etc. And it makes me angry because what am I meant to do???

Anyway. I wish you the best of luck! I found studying the theory helped my brain with exams, and writing in the margins, and counting using my fingers.

autism,fpelbv4,t3_gd00ea,1588549763.0,"I agree with this. I don't feel we should be comparing others experiences in this way and need to make sure we are not just projecting on other people.

For some people autism makes their lives incredibly difficult. Especially with some of the typical co-morbid issues. Just because you experience adultism differently does not make anyone less valid.

It's a strange conflict between a PR campaign and individual people's experiences. For many years autism has been portrayed as totally dehabilitating and that isn't true for everyone. And yes some people appear better socially than others but struggle in different ways. Everyone is struggling to be heard and relate to each other and I think it is easy for us to exclude people we don't feel we relate to.

I have found autism very hard to live with at times. I cannot understand how I would be without it but that does not mean life has been easy. I did not discover it until later and was harsly bullied and abused atleast partially because of it. I also have positives because well yeh there are some things I like about myself and my autism. But that isn't true for everyone and it is perfectly valid to feel you want to be without it. To just be goddamn ""normal"".

Python,fo0st6x,t3_g4yrfu,1587419102.0,"I came from full PHP I now do Python and Node full time :) honestly the main thing I found is letting go of huge multi inheritance trees which so many PHP projects seem to end up with (ones I ended up working on anyway). Keep things flat and simple. Use classes where appropriate but remember in python each file is a module so no need to overcomplicate it. 

Also learn Django and Flask, they are the two main frameworks. Django is kinda like Laravel but way more established and stable and Flask is like express if you have ever worked in node. I don't know a PHP equivalent though there must be one xD it's been a while. 

Anyway yeh language features wise it's None not null, and no $ required for variables. Oh and True and False are capitalised. Ohhhh and learn list comprehension its awesome fun! It's very similar to Javascript syntax in alot of ways.

Work wise, you can find work in both easily enough thou maybe not right in the middle of this epidemic. If you are happy enough picking up new languages I wouldn't accept a junior job or anything if you are more senior just because the language is different. Programming be programming and all and it's not like going to strictly typed or anything. 

Another point. Meta programming in python is sick. If you are doing meta programming in Python you are likely down some kind of hole you don't need to be down ;). It has a place but be careful with it ahahah.

Python docs are great, start with Python 3, Python 2 is no longer being supported. Most documentation I have found for Python has been helpful and concise.

Not that great at pros and cons for languages. It has multi threading support and isn't IO blocking unlike node. It is super fast and fun to write. Also is great at data science type tasks and has some great libraries for that kinda stuff (pandas etc). 

Cons? Setting up the servers are a bit of a faff, but I've never managed to work out guicorn. Maybe because I have never tried xD I deploy via heroku so I don't need to worry. Also environments can be a pain. Use venv for local development it saves a tonne of hassle. That or dockerise the app.

Substituted yeast for starter and adjusted the flour and milk accordingly. For this recipe I went 240g of starter, 180ml milk and 380g flour, however I've seen some people say that 100g of starter is okay for a 7g of instant yeast replacement. Just see how it goes!

I did the first raise for 4 hours, the second for 3/4 and the final one I left the buns out overnight to rise (8hrs). I was worried they would over proof but it seemed okay! My yeast likes it very warm to raise though, it won't do anything in the fridge xD. 

Oh finally I had no apricot jam so used just caster sugar and water, I didn't have fruit peal so used a bag of mixed dried fruit, I didn't have an orange so used a clementine and no apple because I also have no apples! And as said above.I forgot the cinnamon. Still tasted great!"

Other people may disagree but I often find separating them this early ends up causing the plants to go into shock and slow down growing. Be really careful not to damage the root systems too much when you do seperate them.

If you are not sure about trying to separate them then I would thin them down to the two best looking ones, props go for the straightest and biggest ones for now and then once a few proper leaves have fully grown choose the strongest looking one and pull out the other plant and get rid, or try and pot it and see how it goes."

ptsd,fhwu1bn,t3_f3x562,1581930205.0,I can't handle dramas etc. Things based too much on real life. Soap operas are the absolute worst but there are many shows I cannot watch. Thankfully these days my partner watches most shows before me and tells me how triggering it is. Some days I can cope with it others I can't and some shows I avoid all together. I normally watch Netflix etc because then I have easy control over what's going on. But even then I can't watch some of the super hero movies because of triggers etc. It's stuff lots of people don't think about that for me are just way too much.
ptsd,fhwtry3,t3_f4vhug,1581929830.0,"Yup. I was abused growing up, multiple accounts of sexual assault in mid-late teens, finally.left home and got date raped within the first month. Moved to live with my partner got severe health issues, asthma and migraines that impact my life alot just about managing to hold down my job and stay afloat but really it feels alot like drowning lol."
ptsd,fhwtile,t3_f52uc3,1581929459.0,"Bathroom and hide for a bit, but really I go on here, I used to have another support forum 7cups but that has changed beyond recognition. I am a sexual assault survival so I sometimes use RAINN as they have an 1-1 online chat service that I use sometimes (it's American but I used it from the UK) and also if having a really bad time I call hotline services in the UK Samaritans is the main one. You don't need to say any more or less than you want to but just knowing someone is there as listens makes a huge difference. I do also go to my partner sometimes however I have to be careful how much I bring back into the relationship as it can be hard for him to cope with :)."
ptsd,fhwt42l,t3_f4vlcg,1581928902.0,"Yeh 100% I still get triggered by lots of things, though it is getting better over time. But anything tight around my neck still triggers me, even a scarf or just something simple like a t-shirt collar. I got triggered once by my 7 year old cousin giving me a hug with her arms around my neck... That was awkward."
Sims3,fgfy7yw,t3_ev47cf,1580750200.0,Lol I just looked at my families xD week 38 day 5 ahahaha on to gen 4 now :P
Dyslexia,fg6kwnn,t3_ex73ca,1580570678.0,"I can't hold alot of imagery in my head, but I struggle especially with words. I cannot imagine how a word is spelt I have to try and write it or say it to even have an idea what it would be like. I dunno if it's a specific dyslexia thing but it certainly has not helped me."
ftm,ffd5q3y,t1_ffc2hno,1579813937.0,Thank you. Many people write off these things as a cultural thing or something as though it is acceptable but seeing so many people say it is not has helped me feel more comfortable with my reaction. I am not going to report to HR but I am planning on explaining and reporting to HR if it becomes more of an issue.
ftm,ffd5hsb,t1_ffd30el,1579813809.0,Thank you. It was like a slap in the face for me since I was feeling comfortable for once.
ftm,ffd5drv,t1_ffcsjwh,1579813748.0,"I agree, I just struggle to fit into masculine clothing as they assume small hips which I do not have. I normally wear button up shirts which do help. I am just so tired of being misgendered. I do get angry at the fact that I need to make gender a thing before people are willing to think about what they are saying."
ftm,ffcrfeq,t1_ffcljha,1579805714.0,"Thank you for this. It's honestly what I needed to see. I know I do not pass but I try and every time someone says this stuff it crushes me.  Like you do everything you can but people assume and make comments and honestly it hurts. I am so sorry people have reacted this way to you. When your gender is wrong any of this stuff just feels horrible, even if other people don't notice it."
migraine,ffbnpfc,t3_eso1py,1579774563.0,Honestly for triptans I would have to be in pretty severe pain to use them. I take 400mg of ibprofen the moment I feel one coming on and often that helps reduce if not solve the migraine. I have had some pretty bad side effects from triptans including getting overuse headaches that then became more migraines. It was grim lol. Other than that I would have to be a 8+ for a couple of hours to use them and I don't have any in the house so I would have to speak to a doctor to get some. Which well I have done in emergencies but would prefer not to.
autism,ffbiakm,t3_eso9ka,1579766583.0,"For me it was my therapist saying to me that she hoped one day I could talk about what happened to me without laughing and smiling. That I would feel comfortable showing my emotions with her expressing them. I have PTSD for context.

Anyway I went away and got quite upset because I realised that I would have no idea what showing or expressing my emotion would look like. I have always laughed and smiled while talking about terrible things. I honestly don't feel I have control over what my face does and have often felt betrayed and frustrated that my face doesn't show what I am feeling and people misunderstand me. So I started Googling and lo and behold I worked out that this is something many people with autism experience. 

I then started researching more, and realised that many of people's experiences and lists of traits rang true to to me. Being bullied from a young age, feeling left out, being unable to connect with peers, very frequent 'temper tantrums' as a kid. The list goes on. 

Anyway I found both therapy and YouTube videos very useful allowing me to research and then discuss my findings and how I felt that had related to me. After a year of discussion I went to have an official diagnosis and now I am officially diagnosed.

It doesn't have to be something big, but if you feel what you are reading from other people is speaking to you then it is worth looking into, and getting a full diagnosis if you think that would help you :)."
Dyslexia,ff9kn75,t3_ery036,1579715008.0,I am good at reading but terrible at spelling and math and I am great at coding. No idea why ahaha. It just makes sense to me xD.
autism,ff8ionk,t3_es7037,1579680271.0,I don't twitch but I wiggle :P alot. Ahahaha. It's like jfnskfnlsndj and my body has to express it somehow. Sometimes I also make squeaking noises.... :P needless to say my partner has had to get used to it aha
ADHD_Programmers,ff8igg0,t3_es7957,1579679971.0,I messaged every digital agency or place that did any kind of web work and asked if they were willing to offer an internship. You are unlikely to get paid well but it will get you experience and that was enough for me to get my foot in the door. I always learn on the job and if I am struggling understanding something I often take time from my work day to look into it. Now I am training juniors I expect them to do the same. Also worth saying hyperfocus can be super useful here. I bring my headphones to work and just zone into my code :3 much more fun that way or else I do nothing and bounce around the office driving everyone else nuts. Though thankfully as a manager now I can get away with it by just checking in with people lol
autism,ff8hrrw,t3_es7o9l,1579679067.0,"In my experience it's kinda a whole chain of things. We are likely to struggle growing up with parents and teachers. Often not following the rules or following them wrong. We are often told we are not doing things right or feel that we are left out. Often people point out as you are growing up that you are different or weird. You feel out of place and uncomfortable. Aware you are doing things wrong but not being entirely certain of what or how. This causes people to become isolated and to not trust their own judgement.

Then you get people who take advantage of this. They are often looking for vunerable people. People who will not tell others or are isolated. People who do not trust their own instinct. Because these people are easy to manipulate. They take advantage because they can, become your friend and you are so excited to have someone who seems to trust you that you talk with them and start to trust them. Then everything gets worse but everyone told you that you were wrong growing up so maybe the fact that this feels wrong is just you being weird. And then the cycle continues. Also you are terrified of ending up alone. By this stage if you were not isolated before you are now.

Finally you get some of the symptom of autism itself. A lack of express or inappropriate expression can mean that you say something while someone else reads something else. You are try your best to say no, but you were smiling and for some crazy reason laughing at the same time. Or you show no expression at all and people they decide they can read what they want. Abusers often want to ignore the fact that what they are doing is wrong and the fact that many of us struggle with communication gives them the perfect platform to ignore the words and claim body language instead.

There are others things I am sure that make it but this is just my experience along with the experience of a few friends."
autism,ff4o7c5,t3_erljh1,1579568404.0,"So I am autistic, but also my partner also autistic and we both communicate differently. Which can be ... Fun. We talk most stuff out however I love hugs (with him only) but he will never initiate them. Me being friendly can come across as distracting and annoying to him and while he is good at picking up on when I am sad etc I am terrible at it and end up asking him repeatedly to check that he is okay. I talk all my problems out and he would likely rather either ignore them or text message them. Anyway summary is, NT or not we all communicate very differently, and well being autistic can add a whole extra dimension to that.

I would look at how you communicate and look at how they communicate then go from there. At the level when you really know each other it is less about diagnosis and more about 2 people working this stuff out. So okay they may never ask you if you are feeling okay or seem interested. But how about just telling them when you are not okay and suggest ways they could maybe help. Like had a bad day and I wanna chat or can we do X to distract ourselves. For example my partner hates hugs that surprise him so I always ask for permission for a hug before I initiate one. He says yes a surprising amount of the time and now we both like them! 

Also talk with them about your frustrations. What makes you feel rejected or frustrated and then talk about things both of you could do to make it easier. You cannot expect them to change suddenly just as you won't change suddenly either just try and find ways to get around this so you both get what you need. You may find there are things they feel they are missing and frustrate them as well but you don't know. Any relationship is built on communication so I would suggest that!

Anyway sorry I have no resources, I honestly haven't found many online that are not for children but well hope my advice helped!"
ftm,feko6k9,t3_epnmox,1579204133.0,How painful is it? And honestly how functional is it? I would love the surgery if I felt it would act how I feel it should bit I am worried the dysmorphia would always make me feel unreal or wrong even if I did have it. Sorry if this question is too personal btw.
autism,fej8af7,t3_epfj02,1579161177.0,"Animals are often very popular with autistic people. Do be ware though noises they make and things they do can take a while to get used to. Like meowing, running up and down stairs at night etc. But honestly the benefits of having a pet far outweigh any negatives! Do agree that make sure you teach them to respect the cat from the start as otherwise a lack of understanding of what is appropriate can scare the cat and end up with the child being scratched. Pets are a very good way to teach any child responsibility for things that are not themselves autistic or not :3. 

I loved my childhood cat when I was growing up though I don't have many memories of him as I was quite young when he died. Having a dog as a teenager may have saved my life in all honesty. When I was really struggling with school, education and bullying it could feel like the dog was the only one who really was there for me and was not judgemental. I used to curl up with him alot and talk to him for hours. If I had nightmares I would go downstairs and say hi to the dog. He was warm and soft and familiar. As an adult I now have cats and I adore them though it took me 6 months to get used to them and I did find that very hard but now I am so happy I have them and I baby them rather alot ahahah. Also let's are good for meltdowns. My partner has rather severe meltdowns and my cats help with that alot even now he is an adult :).

Anyway. Let me stop talking about my pets. But if your child is excited that's a pretty good indication it will go well xD!"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fej7rc9,t1_fej6f6n,1579160478.0,Yeh. Honestly this stuff isn't even slightly funny... Just makes me sad really. Being autistic isn't a joke.
autism,fej7ju1,t3_epfyyb,1579160215.0,"Hey :) Autism can go undiagnosed for many years, especially in women but also in men. I was not diagnosed until I was 24 and I am pretty certain my dad at the very least is autistic even though he can't seem to recognise it in himself! 

Autism does always show signs in early life. Things like intense and elaborate fantasy worlds, obsessions with specific things (dinosaurs are common but mine was reading from a young age. Also trains, stamps, anything really). Not really playing with toys more organising them - a lack of imaginative play. Also being fussy with food, struggling with routine changes and very regular tantrums as a child (meltdowns). Also being bullied at schools, taking things literally, being too trusting and not having any understanding of danger. Not understanding why you were in trouble and treating adults as a child like equals. I mean these are just some things but it is often looking back at their childhoods that people realise this culmination of symptoms they have had all of their lives. My diagnosis was based on my development from pregnancy through to now.

Some people show more or less traits than others and every case of autism is different. I would look up YouTube videos as they are a very good resource for this kind of information :). 

Tldr: yes Autism can most certainly be missed in childhood and there are many adults in today's society that have gone undiagnosed for all of their lives and may never be."
autism,feh0j1c,t3_ep2t5m,1579106593.0,"I hate this. Everyone thinks I am happy all the time because I either smile or laugh or I don't even know! My face betrays me... I never even realised it but it's lead to so much bullying and people saying they were ""surprised"" they upset me because I seemed fine. I basically seem to smile until I have a meltdown and by then there isn't any saving the situation. It's infuriating.

Anyway. I am sorry you have this too :( I would love to work on it but my face doesn't really do what I tell it to...

Edit: I am sorry someone said that to you. It's really hurtful! Especially hard when you can't express properly that it did hurt."
CPTSD,fed8dhf,t3_eojrul,1579003506.0,Yeh... My parents lectured me so much about being kind to others and not being selfish and looking after each other but when it came down to it they were repeatedly either unwilling or unable to support or help me if I needed it. It's hard knowing that in many ways they were never really parents.
ftm,fed89oz,t3_eojti5,1579003382.0,I don't often have to leave work as mine is often worse in the morning when I have to get dressed but I defs sometimes cannot go into work because it's so bad and I can't make myself leave the house. Sorry you have this too :( dysphoria is not fun.
autism,fe9jk1d,t1_fe9bybz,1578938230.0,":D you sound like an amazing parent :). I will say that I know you want to help your child as much as possible when they are upset but also they are expressing they are upset and that is healthy! Saying that there is likely things you can do to help, things like charts to help pick current emotions or what triggered it may help? I often struggle to speak when I am really upset so yes or no questions can be good as I can nod or shake my head lol. Both my partner and I are greatly comforted by having someone in the same room without talking or someone who checks in regularly when we are struggling so we don't feel alone. Also comfort items or distractions can also be good. I guess find what things he likes and when he is struggling encourage him to use those things to redirect himself! But if hand flapping is working then leave it be :)."
autism,fe94ygs,t3_eo4x1t,1578934283.0,"Hand flapping is the best feeling in the world! Well maybe not quite but it often feels like I might burst with happy or sad or something. It's like there is too much and I have to express it or I might explode :O. Honestly jumping is likely good and helpful! My partner does silly things like that with me when I am super over excited :3 I do agree if over stimulated it's best to just let the hand flapping do its job though it may be good to also try and find some other stimming methods as they may help as well :) fidget items, something to stretch, I also use chews. Not that hand flapping is bad or anything just I sometimes find it's not enough on its own for me :). 

Anyway he sounds great and is likely quite happy with it.  I never know what to do about issues with social stigma but I can assure you it is not a negative thing at all to him :)."
ftm,fe7fksz,t1_fe71bm4,1578913963.0,Oh thanks for that info! I have the appointment and see how it goes but if I really cannot cope thanks for the suggestion and I will ask for it. Sounds much better to be able to do it at home. I am really worried I would put it off for years if I let myself... Esp if this appointment does not go well.
ftm,fe7f99d,t1_fe6xjok,1578913828.0,Ahaha not sure if it's the best either but it sounds like a good idea! Give me something to look forward to afterwards lol.
ftm,fe7f4uh,t1_fe7dxah,1578913779.0,I don't have to but it is strongly suggested to get the test regularly from 25 in the UK. I believe screening in general and well if you do have cancer finding it early is important so I will make myself do it for heath reasons. But no it is not legally enforced.
vegetablegardening,fd8bcql,t1_fd6xwuv,1578216306.0,I think the furthest it has got down to is -2/3 overnight and that was only a couple of days it's been largely around 10 which is crazy warm for December. It's been a weird year weather wise...
vegetablegardening,fd1gyxc,t3_ejuq7a,1578131255.0,So a bit of context it's about 3-4 years old and I grew it from seed. I can't remember what variety it is but every other year so far it has died back just fine in the winter and sprung up again at the beginning of spring. This year it's grown ALOT it is much bigger than the other 2 I have grown and seems to be thriving however should I be concerned that it hasn't died back yet? It has been mild this year but there have been a few frost's?
