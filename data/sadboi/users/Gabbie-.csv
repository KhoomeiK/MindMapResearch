Molested,fil62ec,t3_f8fufg,1582494428.0,"omg girl please don’t cry! What happened is *never* your fault and you shouldn’t have to feel guilty about speaking up, regardless of what type of relationship you have with your molester — molestation is molestation. It really sucks that your mom keeps on insisting that you talk, but i’m sure she wouldn’t be like that if she knew what had happened. Since you were so young, maybe he hadn’t understood it properly? And maybe the fact that you accepted it had motivated him to carry on? Either way, that’s no excuse for what he did and it was disgusting. If your mom insists again, and you don’t want to say what happened, just say that maybe you’re not on good terms and don’t want to talk? It really sucks that the fact that you’re bound by blood means that you need to talk. Though i bet everything would be better if you didn’t have the extra tension. Have you ever considered something like therapy? It could really help you come to terms with what happened. You don’t even need to go into too much detail. With my therapist, she didn’t make me go into too much detail with one of my incidents, because she understood that it can bring back bad memories, but what she did ask is who the molester was. And why did she ask who the molester was? To make sure that he wouldn’t do anything to anyone else. Please just make sure that your brother isn’t doing like that to any other vulnerable people because being a ‘victim/survivor’ isn’t a good thing because nobody should go through that. Anyways, absolute best of luck with recovery <33"

I would label it as molestation/sexual assault, even though it sounds like you’re reducing your problems to the point where it feels like it’s not intense enough to be molestation/sexual assault — or it goes the other way, and you think it’s way more than that, you choose.

Molested,fhbjegz,t1_fhb2v7g,1581443492.0,"Damn that really sucks — your whole situation. It also sucks that domestic violence is so normalised, and i wish third-world countries were able to have more control over the laws, handling law breakers and all that. I also hope that your dad is okay in his own head, even if he did so some trashy stuff. 

The lack of therapist thing is kinda trashy too. I’m studying to become a psychiatrist, and there’s been talk about a new program which may be happening, which send psychiatrists to LEDCs with more conservative societies to kinda help out because mental health is a really big issue and something that’s just as important and physical illnesses. 

I also hope your sister does become better, because who knows, if there isn’t enough doctors to facilitate the needs people in need, she might not be getting the diagnosis and treatment that she could be getting — if she does have some sort of mental disorder. 

I really do hope your situation changes, whether it be that you move, or maybe the area around you gets better. Either way, once again, wishing the best for you <3"

I really hope your sister does come to understand the way she manipulated you because it really is wrong and you probably wouldn’t want her to do that to anyone else. Though she probably does understand, now that she‘s older than all. Maybe the reason behind her actions was how your father acted towards your mother, and the type of psychological trauma it could’ve caused her? It probably left you with troubles too and i really hope your mom and your family are okay. It’s totally not your fault; none of this. Don’t feel guilty about being the negative one in the group, being into porn and that stuff; you used it as a coping mechanism for something that was virtually out of your control. I really recommend that you open up to your therapist about your background because maybe there could be some exercises to help cope with your problems? Either way, i wish you the best of luck on the road of recovery,, it’s gonna be long and hard but we’re totally here for you <3"
Molested,fharcwm,t3_f0wy8y,1581424386.0,"My gosh i’m so sorry about what has happened! I think your brother may have had dodgy experiences, because at the young age it started, he must’ve had something to mould his mind to adapt to that mindset; maybe he had his own sexual abuse experiences? But that’s still no excuse to act how he did when he was older. By the time you were 20 and he was 21ish, he should at least be capable of having some human decency. 

I know it may be hard to talk about, but i really recommend therapy. It can make you feel more comfortable about the subject and could genuinely help you with any ptsd-type symptoms that you could be left with. 

Either way, i wish you the best of luck on the road of recovery, stay safe <3"

Molested,ffmxow0,t3_eu9arb,1580059977.0,"Just because you were high/drunk, it’s not your fault. It’s the molester‘s fault for making any sort of advances towards you without consent. I’m another women and and i think that being high isn’t consent, being drunk isn’t consent and wearing provocative clothing isn’t consent. We live in a society and it makes my blood boil. Us girls should be able to get high without being attacked by men with animal-like cravings. 

My body is covered in self harm scars too and ngl it embarrasses me. I used to blame myself for everything that happened as a child because i developed really early and frequently went out in clothes like tanktops, which would be normal for someone at that age, but not for me because of how my body looked. I blamed myself, calling myself a hoe/slut when really, i should be able to go out in what i want without worrying. I’ve only recently realised that it’s not my fault. 

Sorry about the whole ted-talk-type-thing, but just know that it’s not your fault and hope you regain your confidence in the future <3"
Molested,ffhqq21,t3_etoww7,1579948868.0,"That really sucks. Men get molested/sexually harassed/raped too yet people seem to dismiss it because once again, it’s not so common to hear of it happening to a male, so people almost brush it off as a minority, but it’s just as important. There’s this stupid stigma in our society nowadays which expects men to be tougher, which then leads on for them to find it more difficult to open up. The suicide rate for males is higher than women (at least in the UK) and i lost a male friend to suicide because he couldn’t open up about his molestation as a child. 

Once again though, i’m really sorry that happened; there’s many people here who understand what it’s like to go through that sort of thing, know how difficult it is, yet they have the audacity to downvote. I’m sorry you felt like that, and even if i didn’t read the story myself, thank you for sharing it here and you’re super strong for opening up about it <3"
Molested,ffhpois,t3_etocn9,1579947259.0,"None of this is your fault. I developed extremely early too and get sexually harassed extremely often but i don’t really do much about it. I think it would be best to open up to your parents or something, and would hope to feel some sort of burden lifted off your shoulders — i’m really sorry that happened to you, it really sucks. I think this falls more under the ‘harassment/sexual harassment’ category but it seems to have affected you in similar ways as molestation would’ve done. I would also recommend therapy, but that’s only if you’re ready to open up. Your mental health could be laced with ptsd too, and the doctor can’t really make an accurate diagnosis if you don’t speak, so as i said, only if you’re comfortable.
