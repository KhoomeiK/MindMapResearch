walmart,epsvdq6,t1_epst9d9,1559468769.0,Thanks if they'd ever open the position in the rec
walmart,epsrghn,t1_epsrd3y,1559462092.0,I got bullied out of my weekends off because of seniority scheduling.. they just didn't give me a schedule until I changed to an open availability
walmart,epsrfch,t1_epsrd3y,1559462037.0,As far as I know it does but my managers work with me and yes if you're unavailable your unavailable but they don't have to give you hours if they don't need you certain days
walmart,epsrb5l,t3_bvv1fj,1559461854.0,"You can go online and apply it, select the day(s) the amount of hours you need covered and submit it, usually if it's within 24 hours it will be approved right away if it doesn't go through I would talk to management as soon as you get back or even just call and let them know"
walmart,epsr8kr,t3_bvv2d9,1559461741.0,It's different for every store.. if there's a more versed manager around that knows how you work I would talk to them about it instead.. they can edit the schedule the newer managers just don't like to because they're told to avoid it otherwise if you turn in your availability for 9pm they have to let you leave after it's entered
