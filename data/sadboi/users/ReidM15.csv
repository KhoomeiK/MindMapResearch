Those other things were your environment, not you. Now the things you have, the things you're building, they're all things that are you. Things you want. Things you are creating because you know they make you happy. 

Some days are really tough, some nights are even worse, but always take these things as they come an go. They're not a definition of you or your life. How you overcome them and build on them are things that you're doing and able to do. And that's always a great thing. No emotion is permanent. They're not supposed to be.
