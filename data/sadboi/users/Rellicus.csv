Christianmarriage,fcpatod,t3_eiaus3,1577856507.0,"Happy new year at least!

My 2019 was about the same. Found out wife was cheating December 2018. She initially told me she wanted to fix things but then she just stopped trying and I found out she was with the boyfriend again. 

Long story short, I made some posts about it on here also... we ended up getting a divorce in July since she wanted out. 

My faith was down to an all time low... I know how you're feeling right now because I was just in your shoes. I loved my wife and I didn't want a divorce, but that's what happened despite everything. 

But something, nothing short of a miracle, happened. My thought process turned from how bad things were to how good it is that I've come out of a bad marriage relatively unscathed. I started working on me, eating better, working out, spending more time with friends. I started going to church more...

Point is, nothing significant really changed after the divorce, only how I framed it in my mind. What was the end of my happiness became the beginning of my opportunities for a better future. You'll get through this, and look back at it a better, stronger person. 

It's going to suck for a while. Just keep going, it honestly takes time for your mind to deal with it. Wiah you the best, and hope your 2020 is amazing!"

Now, I'm dating a lot and feeling out what I'm really looking for. I will not settle this time for someone who is just good enough, because that's selling myself short, and it will end the same way (got cheated on in both marriages). 

So... to answer your question: You can't be too picky! I mean, you need to be very picky especially if you want a relationship to honor God! Don't settle for someone you have doubts about. All of the normal traits for a relationship must be there which include: physical attraction, shared hobbies and interests, emotional availability, etc. You have additional requirements for a relationship that honors God, which will require additional sifting... connecting the same way with worship, your individual ministry calling, theology, etc. 

Don't settle! You can compromise on a few things but if you aren't attracted to them and the theology isn't similar enough, it's a deal breaker. Don't rush into anything because you are lonely or you feel like time is ticking, God knows I've got regrets in those areas and it will get your heart all messed up.
