SquaredCircle,fphkw1e,t3_gbv24i,1588623072.0,"Just in case - heres what op posted:

I work in biz dev in sports media. Nothing here should be taken as stock advice and I can't confirm any of it, especially since some of it is secondhand. This post is an overview of the chatter I'm hearing from friends and work acquaintances as media plans are being finalized for the fall.

I posted after George Barrios and Michelle Wilson were forced to resign from WWE that the decision was said to be part of selling the company. That's still the general feeling, but Disney has emerged as the most likely buyer.

The idea that's emerging is that Disney sees WWE as ""idiot proof,"" in the sense that any company with the resources to run it can basically have a guaranteed profit-driver in their portfolio. Warner Media did make overtures about buying the company as recently as February, but they got cold feet about whether or not they'd have the right personnel to operate WWE. As a side note, Warner is thrilled with AEW and they have a lot upper-level advocates who never saw the point in buying WWE when they feel as if they can create their own WWE over the next ten years with AEW. People in WWE obviously disagree with that, but this diminished what Warner was willing to pay, and that was that.

The idea of Disney buying WWE has been hanging in the air for awhile, even before Fox bought Smackdown's license. The McMahon family holds much of the decision-making power for WWE, which is why Michele Wilson and George Barrios were asked to resign. They'd likely be terminated in the event of a sale, so there was no point in having them in decision-making positions in the company if the talks were to get serious. The collapse of the XFL and WWE's live business both due to coronavirus, as well as now having Barrios and Wilson out of the way, motivated both the McMahons and Disney to get the deal done before the end of 2020.

If you're confused as to why WWE to offloading talent even though they have cash in the bank, it's because they don't want that money to be touched because it's a major asset in their asking price for Disney. Also, when you shrink your roster, you shrink your expenses, which also supports the asking price. I heard WWE didn't want talent going to AEW, which is why so few people have been released in the last two years, but now that they're cashing out, they don't care who goes to AEW.

The asking price is somewhere in the range of $20B. My speculation is that Vince would stay on as a consultant in WWE. Kevin Dunn would continue to produce WWE shows until a successor is named and then he'll step into an EP role at Disney. Triple H will work international expansion for Disney and continue to consult on WWE. Stephanie is getting out of the wrestling business. All four would make a killing on their WWE stock in the sale, and will receive Disney stock as well.

They're apparently close to finalizing the deal. Like, really close. It's hard to get a read on it from the WWE side since information and decision-making is so centralized. It's actually ruffled feathers because a lot of people feel like they're being boxed out from the entire discussion. But as recently as this week the word I got is that there's folks who already consider it a done deal and are putting feelers out for new jobs because they assume their role will be eliminated when the sale is finalized. This is especially the case from people on the WWE Network side who are all going to be out of jobs when the Network is folded into Disney Plus, which is one of the major aspects of the deal for Disney.

Fox feels left out in the rain by the whole thing. I'd heard that during their discussions to pick up the Smackdown license, they'd made overtures about buying WWE outright. I don't know if Fox figured they could operate WWE, or if they just wanted to flip it to Disney later. Either way, both Disney and Fox cozied up to the McMahon family by playing nice with the XFL (Disney through ESPN and Fox through Fox Broadcasting Company). When the XFL failed and Disney/WWE got more serious than ever about their talks, Fox sort of feels like they just spent $2B on a show they're going to lose as soon as the license expires (presumably Disney would move Smackdown to ESPN) and another chunk of change on a show that didn't even last a full season.

I also heard Netflix considered buying WWE. The idea is that Netflix's model is turning more to relying on reducing churn, because it's way less expensive to keep a customer than it is to produce something new that wins a customer or wins a churned customer back. Netflix would have cut the live event business, only running shows for Raw, Smackdown, and ""PPVs."" This was at a period last year when Netflix was toying with weekly episode rollouts. Those talks barely got started though because Netflix's investors had no interest in footing the bill to buy WWE.

So basically during this whole period of discussion, Disney has been like that reliable choice WWE keeps coming back to consistently, and after all this time it looks like they're ready to commit. My speculation is that if coronavirus hadn't happened, the sale would still have occurred but not until after XFL's second or third season. This isn't the only property Disney will gobble up in the next 12 months, but it's the biggest. I come across rumors like this all the time and most end up being only slightly true at best, but it's the amalgamation of all these conversations at once from multiple people in multiple companies that make me feel pretty confident this is happening."
