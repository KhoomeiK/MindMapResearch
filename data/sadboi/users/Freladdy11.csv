I do take Cleanse in some games, but it is very situational. I mostly use it when the enemy bot lane is heavily CC based (Thresh - Jhin, Morgana - Caitlin) or when the enemy team has a lot of ""deadly CC"" when teamfighting (Jax's E, Leona's R, Thresh's Q)

If your team start flaming for an off meta pick, weird runes, or weird summoners spells, just mute them, you will experience a greater time and you will have better chances to win :)"

I am aGold IV Support player that often play with locked camera, i find it more comfortable, i don't use unlocked camera that much because i find it difficult and overall awkward to use.

I already know that unlocked camera is better, but I'm struggling to adapt to it.

do you have any advice on how to get used to unlocked camera?

and, if I dont learn that much, do you think i can still climb with locked camera?

Thanks :)"
