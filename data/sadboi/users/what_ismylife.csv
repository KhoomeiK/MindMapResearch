medicalschool,f5bx8gk,t1_f5an6zt,1572127146.0,"Are you in medicine? People aren’t coming in the room just for shits and giggles, everything in the hospital starts early in the morning and the whole point of pre rounding is to check on people and make sure there isn’t a problem. If I come into a room before rounds and a patient is sound asleep I go see other patients and come back later, but if I don’t check in and examine them before rounds then I’m not doing my job. We can’t figure out everything that’s going on just by looking at the computer and I’ve caught someone having an NSTEMI before during pre rounds"
Residency,eqxj1qj,t1_eqww9t9,1560370024.0,I'm on an SNRI (Effexor) and I've found that it's actually increased my sex drive. I think it's mostly because my depression/anxiety was killing any sex drive I had left and the benefit of alleviating the depression (and therefore restoring libido) outweighed any negative effects on libido the drug might have.

blackmirror,eq6xfds,t3_bwzn6r,1559837042.0,"Andrew Scott's character's story was so tragic to me. The fact that it could happen to anyone makes it both relatable and scary - so many people, myself included (shamefully) are guilty of looking at their phones from time to time while driving. Do it at the wrong time and this could happen to us. Also, it's sort of ambiguous whether or not his fiancée would have survived if he hadn't been looking at his phone - it could have been 100% the drunk driver's fault, and that ambiguity adds another layer to his story."

I can see that causing some complicated issues in relationships."

weddingplanning,epwagj0,t3_bwagqt,1559570720.0,"Totally agree with your note about FS's reaction during the ""first look,"" or during the entire wedding as well! I bragged the entire day that I am ""not a cryer"" (which is usually true) and ended up crying 4 times total throughout the day. My husband is not a cryer either but stayed true to his word (he was just joyfully happy). And funnily enough, he literally jumped up in the air and looked shocked when he saw me at first during the first look, but the true reason for that is because the photographer had me come up behind him and then had him turn around, and he didn't realize how close I was going to be! Haha. But when posterity looks at the photos they won't know the real reason ;)"
