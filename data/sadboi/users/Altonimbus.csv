LoveLive,fq5l3h7,t3_ggx283,1589109488.0,That's great improvement! I've only started trying digital too and would like to ask what software did you use? Hoping to see more of your artwork <3

pokemon,foionp3,t1_foi7fpm,1587792224.0,Nah I think the spikes are there because cyndaquil is a hedgehog. The spikes were obv changed to the flames which was a great design. But I wouldn't mind a rock type cyndaquil.

mentalhealth,fmhf8ry,t1_fmhdrsw,1586077689.0,"Oh God I think I'm in this phase, you put into words what I'm struggling with right now. I'm 18, and most of my friends since high school tell me that I'm too mature and understanding for my age. I see a lot of people confiding in me when they need it, then leave my side when they're better. I don't mind it though, I understand how people don't last very long. But...recently I've been having signs of depression for months now and had anxiety for years too. I'm just not diagnosed uet so I don't mind it much."
LoveLive,fma29cs,t3_ftvnd5,1585882036.0,"These are really good edits. Both look flawless, especially the NicoMaki edit. Looking forward to the next ones!"

LoveLive,fm0ohzr,t1_fm0l1nl,1585662900.0,"They seemed to be teased a lot since the very start of the pvs, much like umieli that didn't see the light of day. But I can understand why you don't see it as a romantic relationship, all of them are just friends tbh. It's just nice to ship them."

elsword,fldnafg,t1_fl8lbqs,1585067938.0,Thanks! I'll download the game soon! I'll be trying out laby when I play. I mained Sakra Devanam (Ara) before so it's nice to change things up.
elsword,fldn4gu,t1_fl9cnmv,1585067846.0,"Cool. I'll try out the new character then! Laby seems promising. And yeah, the lockdown in our country gives me too much time on my hands."
stevenuniverse,fld53in,t1_fld12cw,1585056763.0,"I agree with this. I think what the episodes show is that Greg isn't the perfect father. It's in that episode where we see that Greg was already flawed from the start, despite being regarded by Steven as the best dad. Greg still did great for a half gem child, but because of his own upbringing, he imposed a carefree life onto steven without reprimanding or giving him discipline."

GYEE,fi6jyzl,t1_fi6js8o,1582198334.0,In what point of the game do you reroll? Seems p long to get many pact stones at the start of the game
GYEE,fi6jr19,t1_fi6jmrm,1582198072.0,"Damn the rates in this game are atrocious then, and pact stones are not relatively easy to get. I think I'll just reroll til I get him. Thanks a lot! Hope you summon a gold character of your liking soon!"

socialanxiety,f6u56qd,t3_dt1p6d,1573158253.0,"I totally understand how you feel. I was always anxious on putting my face on my profile ever since my anxiety got worse, so I put fictional or animated characters in place of my profile picture. I'd put pictures of my pets or video game characters instead. But I also get anxious how people would judge me solely on putting nerdy stuff on my profile so I actually tried to just put a pitch black profile picture for a week. It really sucks how much energy I pour into it just thinking about it. I've quit using facebook for months now and it helped me a bit."
