Your first question really depends on your skills and fighting style, etc. And i’m not the best person for that, i’m sorry 
The spirit elements attack like this: Fire beats wind, wind beats water, water beats fire (beat = advantage). The others get kinda confusing... Light beats time and dark, dark beats light and time, Star beats dark and light, time beats star. You can also go to equip > the i (info) button under matk > and scroll down, you’ll get the chart. 
For getting good, it’s by raising your gearscore. this is something I even struggle to this day. Gearscore is raised by the COST of each weapon, armor piece, helm piece, monster you have. It’s right under the attack and defense details on a square of a gear piece. But even if you have a high cost, it also matters what CLASS you are. The color of your class matches your element (unless you’re a rook, berserker, or treasure hunter) so stick to those. 
I hope all this helps you!"

You did the best you could, and i’m so proud of you for keeping yourself up during it because it’s so scary. I advise you to get him into an inpatient, residential, or even partial hospitalization with a co-occurring (drugs + mental health) program. It’s done me really well and many others as well. He’ll hate the idea at first but will thank you later, i promise that. The doctors will agree if that was what sent him there in the first place- especially if he’s on suicide watch. I wish the best for you and your healing - You’re so strong."

Also, you might have something similar to what my mother has, which is just a general reaction to carbs of the sort. And you may have a sugar intolerance too, which is similar to me. Glucose you might be slightly intolerant to.
The carbs thing, i suggest you go on diet like Whole 30 which basically removes every allergen type food. Then, you slowly add in foods to see which you react to and just cut those out of the diet. It worked for my mother and father very well"
