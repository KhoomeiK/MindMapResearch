When i reached 17 years, i was finaly able to control my adhd, turns out i have the hyperfocus type of adhd. Soon after i learned that, i got a internship at one company, subsidiary of volkswagen. 

Later that they offered me a project, my own project that i will have to manage. Halfway throughout the completition, i was asked to present that project at a conference where every manager, even the ceo was present. At this point, i am 17 and making a lot more money than my teachers, that said i am worthless.

If you would accept an advice from me, it would be to never truly give up, never stop chasing your dreams. If you feel that you are worthless, than you only need to ask yourself how can you change that. And once you focus on how to actually change that rather than spending your brainpower on thinking that you are worthless, you will soon find out that your are not. That happend to me. Now its your turn friend."

I just zoned out and was focused on something else. Then teacher asked me something and i didn't even had a clue what subject are we onðŸ˜‚. Usualy i got labeled as stupid and troubled kid. This was hard as fuck because i didn't even understood why are they laughing at me. My mother took my to a psychologists and she helped me greatly with my self esteem.

As years went by i learned to control it and started using it also on things that i didn't cared for and the things i was ""studying in the zone"" became relevant. That's when things changed drastically.
The stupid boy is now at high school, is on a list of best students, licensed to teach my classmates some languages and also going to study software engineering at uni(one of the hardest subjects)

Also i am one of 2 people in our class that were hired for our mandatory praxis by a company that is paying me(otherwise its not paid)

In my opinion it is a great advantage, only thing is that if i am cooking something and start working on something else in the mean time, it will burn for sureðŸ˜‚"

productivity,ewat1ft,t3_cnhnt2,1565251195.0,"You should consider those factors:

1. Mood- you can achieve more in an hour when you feel good than in 3 hours when you do no. For example i had to finish some calculations for electro engineering project. I was working my ass of late at night when i was tired and in 2 hours, made no progress. When I woke up the next day, took me 1/2 hour to do it.

2. Learning habits- you should be aware that there are some habits, that can tremendously increase your producitivity- like regular breaks from learning so your brain can process the info you tried to push it it. Try to learn everything without breaks and it will became a mess

3. Learning ""algorithms"" - this one is little harder to explain, but human brain remembers feelings and associations mutch better that straight facts.
For example, let's say that you can't remember one specific date for history subject. Try playing a story in your head that you are a tour guide and you are telling a story to tourist including this year or that thanks to those numbers, you have won a lottery. Remember the more absurd, the better.

If your friend is aware and using those tricks and knowledge, it is no surprise that he is doing so good. You should just ask him, to induce conversation, start with telling him one of these and ask him if he is using itðŸ˜‰"

I want to share a little story with you, and yes that story will be about how this combination helped to overcome anxiety and helped to reach the I don't give a fact mindset.

 In one book called The game by Neil Strauss I read about the guy who was extremely shy and had no self confidence. He always waited and though what others might think of his actions, before he did something. Some of you might know this feeling, it has also affected me, you want to ask a girl out but you have no confidence to do so. 

This guy couldn't stand it no more and did for many people an unthinkable thing:
He has putted on a really smelly hockey dress, with a goalie's helmet. For the decoration he glued a pink vibrator to the helmet and started waking throughout the crowds of people. 

It was painful as hell for him, but he lasted doing so for several hours. The longer he was doing so, the easier it felt. After this experience, he said that it helped him to get rid of anxiety and from this point forward, he never mutch cared about what people think about him. Or by other words, it has greatly improved his life and today he is a pick up artist (yes i mean girls)."

Not having money might and nearly always will make you feel like you are a loser, a no one.

So now you have 2 options: 

Blue pill: Continue to complain about not having money and feeling bad because life is not destined for you and achieve nothing in the end

Red pill: Start working on solutions, and don't tell me that you can't improve yourself if you don't have much money. Many rich people started with nothing, literally nothing. Start running or working out on street workout, that will make you feel beter and before you know it you will find a way to solve or at least improve your financial situation,

YOU JUST NEED TO START MATE
