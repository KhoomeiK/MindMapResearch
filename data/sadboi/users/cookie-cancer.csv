It completely fucked up his head, and he beat the shit out of my uncle, who had and still has a small percentage of his heart working naturally. Meanwhile I was hiding in a bedroom, scared that I was next. I didn't know what was happening, but I knew it was really bad. Everyone's okay, my uncle is fine, my dad's cool. I know people have been through a lot worse, it's just the fact that I was so young that made it more scary for me."

No one EARNS happiness. Everyone deserves to be happy. Obviously, you can't always be happy, and you can't always do the things that make you happy. However, you shouldn't be working 12 hour shifts and crying yourself to sleep at night in hopes that you'll get rich and be happy in a few years. You should work towards goals while trying to maintain the balance of work and ""play."""

Another one: I had drama class with a relatively outgoing, bubbly girl. We weren't really friends, but we were acquainted. One day, she was super pale, and just started describing to me in detail how badly she wanted to die. I felt really bad for her, and I tried to offer words of encouragement, but I was a freshman, what did I know? I decided against reporting her because I didn't know if it would make the situation worse or not. The next year, it comes out that she had committed suicide. I'll never live down that guilt, but I know I probably couldn't have made a difference in the end. Okay, now for the funny answer; in middle school, we had an early release day, and our chorus teacher just DIDN'T SHOW UP to class. Some students went to the principal, and he called her, obviously. She was CLEANING HER CLOSET and didn't realize that the schedule was different for the day."

The one thing that kept me going that whole time was music. I picked up violin when I was 11, and 4 instruments later, writing music was my passion. Whenever I'm feeling really emotional, sometimes i just sit down at the piano or pick up a guitar and write. For me, it gets those emotions out, into something tangible, and something I can be proud of. That doesn't mean that it's easy. Playing music is hard when I'm depressed, but most of the time it helps. Of course, there are times that it doesn't, because things can't work 100% all the time. But I definitely think that music helped me live through my problems until I could get treatment, and is still helping me through the cracks in my medications until we can get everything stabilized. I appreciate that you're researching this topic because it's gone unnoticed for a long time."

Korean Ballads

I am a huge ballad fan, it's all I'm listening to at the moments, so here are some suggestions

[Jin's Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJXmOugipmg)\- It's an oldie but I really love the song and the music video makes me cry every time I watch it

[K Will's Please Don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdUiCJnRptk)\- This one is also an oldie and I'm not sure if it's quite considered a ballad but I really love the music video 

[Iu's ending scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5ok0ljrzA)\- I really like the music video, and the song is absolutely gorgeous. In my eyes, IU is the ballad queen for me. 

[Park Won's Stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hZa60t8wSE&list=PLvcIGqC_LPPKhxEe6symaItkDN9Jwt69w&index=8&t=0s)\-  I'm not a big fan of the music video, but I fell in love with the song when I heard it

[Ji Jin Seok's Goodnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1X8gBari6Q&list=PLvcIGqC_LPPKhxEe6symaItkDN9Jwt69w&index=17&t=0s)\- I'm pretty sure this is the only song he's done but I love it a lot

[1415's When It Snows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzJ36wIgw24&list=PLvcIGqC_LPPKhxEe6symaItkDN9Jwt69w&index=20&t=0s)\- The first half of the song is my favorite part. It's just really gorgeous overall though.

[BTS's spring day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEeFrLSkMm8)\- something about this song gets me every time i listen and watch the video.

Korean pop songs

[BTS's blood sweat and tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmE9f-TEutc) is my dad oh my lord

[IU's palette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9IxdwEFk1c)\- This is honestly my favorite pop song in history it is so good

[IU's BbiBbi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM0xDI5R50E)\- is the biggest bop that exists

[Monsta X Alligator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C3hIJg4rHo)\- I really like this song but I was at the concert where Wonho hurt his knee and it was during this song and it made me sad. Overall bop though 

[Sunmi's Lalalay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrggmyDhWBo)\- I honestly can't get enough of this song it's so good 

[RM's Seoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8wI5ZosdRA)\- is really wonderful, it's my favorite song by him 

[TXT's crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3iSnJ663II)\- this song is so good and the music video is so pretty but i love it

[IU's Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiVmQZwJhsA)\- This song is very cute and fun

Live Kpop That I Love

[IU""s by the stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj71jzO5U8k)\- I believe this is one of the best live performances I have ever seen ever 

[IU's Hidden Road](https://youtu.be/2CaCBOcHx5w)\- I'm pretty sure this is a live cover but I love her voice with this song.

[IU's Knees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1JUfCyeT5E)\- I love this song's meaning and her live performance is amazing.

[Hopipola 1000x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw_uO-4hsKM&list=PLvcIGqC_LPPJ9D7d__oxuJ0OL9ybshfgz&index=2&t=0s)\- Okay, this performance is number 1 on my list of good live performances. Everything about it is absolutely perfect, and everyone is extremely talented.

[Gaho's Stay Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GHvBqysNHg)\- This man has the best voice and the widest vocal range of anyone I have ever heard. 

[BTS Dionysus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-moUJ3Lw_TQ)\- This song is crazy hype and the performance of it is so cool 

Non Kpop

I don't listen to much non kpop so it'll probably be the same artist

[Dodie somewhere only we know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V29PGEixPWs)\-This is definitely a cover but I love her version of it

[Dodie Human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T60XUVrnYt4)\- I really like the music video for this, and the lyrics go well with it

[Dodie Sick of losing soulmates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qGFAkyfjDU)\- this  is one of my favorite music videos and songs in general, it's so pretty

[Dodie She](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEdZFhCEjWI)\- This song is just really pretty and helped me discover my sexuality honestly.
