SuicideWatch,f5ou458,t1_f5ob3kp,1572332329.0,"I can relate to a lot of what you are saying.

I have known for more than 20 years that when I die, it won‚Äôt be a natural death. I never accomplish\finish anything, so why would life itself be any different?

I have tried and failed to kill myself. I hade taken pills, and I have come a mere safety away from shooting myself with my .40

Oftentimes, I get fed up with my pains and start to feel like it is time. I‚Äôll start getting things in order (I have a husband and kids so I try to get rid of junk that only I care about, make sure insurance is paid etc etc) and the simple act of making a decision and getting ready creates a big relief, like a light at the end of the tunnel.

I don‚Äôt take my death lightly and I have decided that I don‚Äôt want to do it during one of my bipolar crisis moments, but instead want to get my head balanced so I can be sure I am of sound mind when I do it (if that even makes sense)

I don‚Äôt want people to just see me have a freak-out moment and kill myself seemingly spontaneously. I want people to understand that I have given it a lot of thought and ultimately chose this after plenty of time considering things.

Do you get a sense of relief knowing the date you have chosen? Like does it remove the sense of dilemma for now, knowing the time is coming but isn‚Äôt here yet?

Sometimes I instantly feel relieved having decided that I will do it soon (after this or that). Because then for that amount of time, I don‚Äôt have the constant ‚Äúshould I do it? Now maybe?‚Äù occupying my mind.

So far, it has worked out that deciding I will give myself the time to sleep on it longer than the current emotional moment has helped me ride it out and choose to hold on a little longer. Not desperately, but feeling in control of my own fate. 

I am also chicken, but the more I think seriously about it, the braver I get.

In a moment of clarity I asked my husband to change the combo on the safe because a gun is too quick and easy to make a rash decision. If I am truly committed, I will go through the steps to do it a different way.

That, and the fact that I don‚Äôt want to leave a gigantic mess for the ones I love to clean up.

Anyways, I have put years and years of thought into this. Truth be told, the only reason doubt has overridden my desire to end my suffering and worthlessness is the fact that I have a 4 and a 6 year old son. Losing me at this age would change their personalities and life direction drastically.

My father left when I was 3 and I know what that did to me. And I still get to see him a couple times a year. I don‚Äôt want to screw my boys up the way I got screwed up.

But I digress... I am just saying that having a plan actually makes me feel better, then my mood ends up stabilizing and I can look at my decision pragmatically rather than emotionally. I think it benefits me and could benefit others as well.

Best to you, whatever you decide is right to you."
SuicideWatch,f5oa248,t1_f5o2spz,1572313255.0,I agree with this. Have surgery with general anesthesia. I think that‚Äôs pretty much what it will be like after we die.
SuicideWatch,f5o9ab4,t1_f5o34sv,1572312781.0,"I get this

I have been suicidal off and on for more than 20 years.

Once I tried to overdose and took a box of sleeping pills, drank as much alcohol as I could stomach without barfing, and whatever else I could think of (valerian root, melatonin etc)

The experience was way strange and I was very aware of it. All in all, I ended up flopping out of the bed and doing a death crawl so I could vomit. Looking back I wonder why I didn‚Äôt just puke right on the floor there. Huh.

Point of that being that when I thought I was too far off the edge, I felt like I wanted to stop dying.

Many years later, I had a dream that I was so heavy and couldn‚Äôt lift my arms or anything. In my dream I was in the bathtub, drowning, and I was feeling all kinds of regretful sorrowful feelings and was relieved when I woke up. I felt like, at least for the time being, I stopped doubting that I still wanted to live.

Crappy dream, but I am glad I had it."
SuicideWatch,f5o8ba9,t3_do76d0,1572312176.0,"TL;DR
I am pretty sure death feels like nothing, the way general anesthesia feels.

But if there is an afterlife, it will probably be absolutely nothing like this existence and the crap that we hate about this world won‚Äôt exist to us anymore.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I have had quite a few surgeries under general anesthesia, and I imagine that once our brain stops firing, it will be just like that.

For those who haven‚Äôt had general anesthesia, it is absolutely nothing, NOTHING. Then you wake up. Maybe 30 minutes later, maybe 9 hours later. 

It literally seems like 10 seconds then you wake up somewhere else, cold, shuddering and in immense pain. I felt like someone disemboweled me in my case (4 times). Every time I wake up from surgery, I think to myself that if I didn‚Äôt wake up, I wouldn‚Äôt be sad; even experience it to care.

Either that, or there is some sort of afterlife, but I am pretty sure if there is any form of consciousness after death it will be so otherworldly that we won‚Äôt care, and probably will have no memory of this life.

Without a body we can‚Äôt feel physical pain. Is emotional pain from our brain or from our ‚Äúsoul‚Äù (whatever one may call it)?

I bet emotional pain won‚Äôt exist either. No memory. No bodily pain. No tiredness, anger, obligations, happiness or love. I think the big question is whether any form of awareness persists.

But caring, in and of itself, is what causes joy. And the greater your capacity for joy, one has an equally immense capacity for pain.

Khalil Gibran said
‚ÄúYour joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain...‚Äù

‚Äú... Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.‚Äù

I, for one, often question if the joy is enough to make the pain worth it.

Obligations and suffering are just too much for some people. I don‚Äôt think there is anything to be ashamed of if you would rather not have the obligations and suffering.

I have 2 poems that represent opposing views and I alternate from week to week which one feels most true to me.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

*Invictus
BY WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY*

Out of the night that covers me, 
      Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
I thank whatever gods may be 
      For my unconquerable soul. 

In the fell clutch of circumstance 
      I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
Under the bludgeonings of chance 
      My head is bloody, but unbowed. 

Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
      Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years 
      Finds and shall find me unafraid. 

It matters not how strait the gate, 
      How charged with punishments the scroll, 
I am the master of my fate, 
      I am the captain of my soul. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Society frowns upon those who decide to be the master of their own fate, but it is only because those who remain will suffer the sadness or tragedy.

The other poem is called My Captain By Dorothea Day

It is a juxtaposition of the sentiment of Invictus, written from the viewpoint of Christian hope. I will leave it off of here because people are touchy about religion, but it is an interesting rewrite that completely changes the meaning of Invictus for me.

I only bring it up because there is some philosophy waxing (which is natural when pondering life and death)

Theologically, I can‚Äôt say for sure which makes more sense and I will never judge anyone for believing something I am not even sure about.

Afterlife brings me hope, but sometimes I just realize that hope stinks and sets me up for pain and disappointment. But if there is an afterlife I have no reason to believe it will be anything even close to what this crap feels like, and if there isn‚Äôt, I won‚Äôt be aware in order to be disappointed.

Shrug. All I know is I don‚Äôt have fear, either way. So that means I don‚Äôt have much to worry about regarding the subject of afterlife.

Suffering seems to be born of this physical world. So given that and all I have already said, I doubt the chances of eternal suffering in the afterlife as well."

I believe people ought to have autonomy over their life, including the end of it if they see fit.

I agree that there are many young people who don‚Äôt know their own potential. I support any resources and programs that try and reach out to people and give them help seeing their life with a different perspective.

They might be underrepresented here. But the discussion has become a general conversation about reasons that may not be directly related to pain. Or in other words, situations where removing all pain or loneliness might still not deter them from not appreciating this life or valuing their own.

I think the general consensus here is that we should not insist on the belief that everybody *should* force themselves to live against their true will while they search for meaning or joy, simply because some other people are bothered by the idea that they might end their own life.

I am only saying that we are here to respect the discussion without telling people what they should or should not do, what they should or should not feel, and especially not label people based on their actions or thoughts because we can never really see through their lens.

Offering encouragement is one thing, but telling them they will certainly be an utter disappointment if they do choose to end their life is kind of crossing a line here.

Maybe they just feel like they will never find meaning, purpose, or impact the world in any positive meaningful way. Maybe life is boring and they feel things look brighter on the other side. Maybe it isn‚Äôt pain. Maybe it is a lack of feeling.

Or maybe they are dependent on someone they love and feel like it would be better for that person if they were gone. Maybe a disabled person who doesn‚Äôt feel like there is any reason to live if they can‚Äôt even wipe their own butt. Maybe a wife who is ill and is ready to relinquish life so her family can cash out a fat insurance policy.

I think there are altruistic reasons some people may want to die.

Wanting the pain to stop suggests that they are suffering something that they feel they will never be able to get out of, but would be happy living if those pains were gone. Like someone with a chronic illness. Or a woman emotionally trapped in an abusive marriage who can‚Äôt find the resources to help her get out. Wanting the pain to stop and wanting to die is an indicator of pain + hopelessness.

Then there are those whose spiritual beliefs might make them want to move on to the next stop.

And psychotic people have countless reasons, I am sure.

Sometimes things feel so hopeless that I am surprised I have chosen not to act for this long. There is only one person I know who truly understands what this feels like. 

You can tell the difference between people who have really been there and people who smile and comfort you by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had hard times too‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been really sad before‚Äù. You can just tell. It is irritating.

AskDocs,f18iozf,t1_f17vb6q,1569258430.0,"Thanks, this reinforces my suspicion. Maybe I should take calcium supplements so the insurance company will pay for me to see endocrinologist.

I am kidding. But not really. But sort of.

To update: had the lithotripsy. Everything after that had me freaking out about my kidneys; it was 100x worse than my prior lithotripsy. But after several weeks it seems normal.

Microalbumin is crazy high on my own urine test strips at home, but serum labs show protein is normal. Going to do urine protein tests on my next follow up. After lithotripsy they couldn‚Äôt visualize protein because urine was too dark. egfr after lithotripsy was 62. I imagine that has improved, but haven‚Äôt had a follow up test yet.

Barium swallow showed normal function in upper GI, and endoscopy came up with slight signs of ulceration. Barium swallow shows active inflammation in ascending colon where I had my bowel resected, so crohn‚Äôs flare is likely. But it is not at the location of LLQ pain. Intermittent pain persists.

Colonoscopy showed no fistula, but some lesions I think. (I don‚Äôt trust my memory). Biopsies, awaiting results.

Still awaiting neuro appointment, and I can‚Äôt stand being this way anymore. My life is a (worse) wreck because of my cognitive problems.

I am going to ask for endocrinologist referral I think. Better do it before the end of the year I suppose.

Best of luck on your surgery :)"

We offered fleet washing a couple times but for the time it takes, it just doesn‚Äôt pay enough. We make the best PW money doing surface cleaning for college campuses and medical centers.

We were doing St Joseph Medical Center‚Äôs driveways for a long time. But their facilities manager retired, and you know the rest of the story.

We started residential carpets when we realized how easy commercial floor care is, and since we have the equipment, we are finding pretty good money in the higher end homes.

NoStupidQuestions,ewcmzug,t1_ewc8h18,1565287356.0,"This was well put. I also want to add that, from my perspective, **Christians are one of the religious groups that are DEEPLY hated by other religious groups, and more notably, non-religious people.**

I have never heard people outwardly shouting ‚ÄúF@@@ Buddhism‚Äù or ‚ÄúF@@@ atheism‚Äù the way they do with Christianity and Islam (the most prominent examples)

It is clear to me that any group that feels unaccepted by another group will hate that unaccepting group (ie LGBTQ+ by Christians) and it seems Atheists can‚Äôt stand any evangelical religion, or any religion that claims to be the only truth (which by nature, most do; but Christians especially)

It also seems to me that people hate any group that murders or cuts off body parts as a common punishment for less than grave crimes (which are grave in their opinion because of their views of what is unacceptable to God) and that hatred pretty much makes sense to me. But to them, they are devout and often so devout that they do things that hurt themselves deeply, such as shunning a child.

So I am admitting that I judge and despise certain groups because of certain actions that are terrible according to my world views. This is true of most of humanity.

There is a lot more to say on this but the main point is pretty much that groups that don‚Äôt mind their own business are the ones who are hated and acted against the most, which sure feels like persecution. If a person hesitates to be open about their beliefs due to fear of unjust treatment, that sounds like persecution.

I think same reason some people hide the fact that they are not cisgender or heterosexual.

And sadly, some groups that cannot hide the reason they are persecuted, such as racial groups.

NoStupidQuestions,ewcdbea,t1_ewa8b59,1565282753.0,"Haha I never said it would be easy.

**In all fairness, most of those guys‚Äô bras were way too small in the underbust,** which you can tell because their armpits were bulging out over the band. This is an unnecessary hell that unfortunately many women don‚Äôt ever get fixed with a proper fitting. It is pretty awkward in a dressing room with your shirt off in front of a sales person.

The strap problems are legit, and they didn‚Äôt even mention that after a bra has been worn for x amount of time (varies by quality of manufacturer) the strap adjusters start slipping which means you are perpetually fussing with the straps or having the cups droop because the straps are too loose.

If a woman is blessed with larger breasts, an underwire is necessary, and those bitches will stab your armpits until they bleed if you don‚Äôt have a brand new $80+ bra.

Undersweat sucks, just imagine swamp balls; it is similar.

Having the wrong cup size is uncomfortable AND ugly. And get this: if you are a 36B (36 is inches around chest) and you lose a size around your ribcage without your boobs changing, you become a 34C because the cup size is relative to chest size. 

It is expensive to always have a proper fit if you have a body that fluctuates a lot, so poorly fitting bras are pretty normal.

I could go on but I didn‚Äôt mean for this to sound like a rant. It was supposed to be educational. I guess it hit home lol."
