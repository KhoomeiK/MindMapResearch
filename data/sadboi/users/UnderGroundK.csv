The day this happened I went through the exact same routine. After wiping the table and doing the dishes, I grabbed something from the fridge to make a sandwich and placed them on the table. But before making the sandwich, I remembered that I haven't fed my pet canary yet and I went to do that. It took 2 mins max and then I went back into the kitchen and stopped a few feet away from the table because my brain realized that something was off. There was a freaking measuring cup right on the middle of my table. I was home alone and I had already wiped the table clean like 20 mins earlier. To this day, I haven't been able to explain how that measuring cup got there. The only far fetched explanation that I could come up with was that for some reason my brain decided to completely ignore the cup's existence the whole morning, even when I was wiping the table. The cup was also clean and nobody would've had a reason to use it in the morning. The rest of my family are just drinking their coffee and leave for work."

Even when there's a situation that I have never been through. Life teached me to never judge someone for their actions before hearing them out as well. Because things are not always as they seem. And I just can't understand why so many people would prefer to jump to a wrong conclusion instead of giving you a chance to explain yourself. 

I still have a long way to go when it comes to realizing my self worth. I think this has been the hardest thing to work on so far. Who would've thought that loving yourself can be so difficult..

That hurt too much and I decided to keep everything to myself from then on. It's still incredibly hard to explain to someone why I'm reacting the way that I do whenever something triggers me. For example, I am really scared of loud noises and whenever I hear something loud or someone screaming, I freeze and start shaking.

AskReddit,fjao51r,t1_fjalne5,1583177331.0,"Thank you! ❤️ Yes, 3 of them (black, tabby and calico) are really fluffy, especially the tabby and the other two have the normal type of fur. Their mother is really fluffy as well."
AskReddit,fjaa9g9,t1_fja95po,1583169529.0,Thanks! They are my fluffy kids 😂. I think I know who the father is now that you've explained. There used to be an orange and white male around in the neighbourhood around the time they were born.
AskReddit,fja8x6o,t1_fja5y5h,1583168776.0,"Yes, the tuxedo one is black and white and the calico is white/orange/black. The tabby is grey. Here are some pictures of them.

The only one that's missing is the white one with a few black dots because I gave him away when he was still a kitten. And the first picture is of the mother."

AskWomen,fiyao0s,t1_fiy7lxv,1582835785.0,"It would be, indeed! Oh and another weird thing about these type of dreams. I rarely dream about people that I have never seen before. It's usually someone that I recognize from real life. But the weird part is that I have no feelings for them what so ever irl. But in the dream, oh boy! The feeling is so intense that it's making me question myself about it when I wake up, lol."
AskWomen,fiy78xz,t3_fabvut,1582833901.0,The weird thing is that the feeling of being in love/feeling attracted to someone in a dream is totally different from what I feel in real life. It's hard to explain because I've never experienced such a feeling in normal day to day life. It's so intense and peaceful at the same time. And I always hate it when it's over because I know that in a day or two it'll be gone.. I wish I could experience that feeling in real life as well.
MercyMains,fiqew8i,t3_f9a4nv,1582642765.0,"I'm usually asking the other healer if they want to play their main. I'll also switch if they ask me nicely. I won't do it if they are being rude about it. I've had some matches where I'd run into a group and they'd be like ""just give my friend Mercy (or whatever hero I was playing)"". And I refused because they were so rude about it. And after that, they made sure to tell me how much I suck throughout the whole match and how we were only losing because of me..."

Absolutely no one stopped for a minute to even remotely try to comfort me or tell me that ""it's gonna be okay"". Everybody just gets mad if I'm not happy and smiling all the damn time. So I have to put on this ""mask"" every single day so people around me would stop feeling so damn offended all the time. I'm not absurd, I know it's hard to understand what we're going through, but you don't have to be an asshole about it. Sometimes, we just need someone to listen..."

Subnautica_Below_Zero,fi1s7vw,t1_fi1lakm,1582063739.0,I think I did both quests? I have sent the kharaa sample and I have found Jeffrey's PDA. Is there anything else?

And what exactly activates the shield? Me sending the enzyme up?"
Subnautica_Below_Zero,fi1fohk,t1_fi19tmb,1582056824.0,"Hmm, so the only thing I seem to be missing is the 2nd ""special resource"" in glacial basin? I didn't know there's something else besides the kharaa sample there. Any clue for what I should be looking for? Plants? Rocks? Creatures? I remember being able to also send the enzyme42 from the first game to the Vesper in the earlier version of BZ, when the Emperor was still in the game. 

And from the optional list, I have no idea what to look for to construct a gift? I haven't came across anything like that in my exploration. The only area I think I haven't fully explored is the Crystal Cave, because it's a bit disorienting, everything looks the same. I only know where the body part for Al-an is and the red crystal area."

thelongdark,fhxkt05,t1_fhvoqvd,1581956621.0,"Thanks for the tips! I just managed to get to the Pleasant Vally. I somehow missed the way upwoards in the cave system yesterday, the one that leads to the Pleasant Valley's exit. But I found it today after finishing the Mystery Lake area. I took my stuff back from the Dam and now I'm exploring the Valley!"
thelongdark,fhv8sk0,t1_fhv7mk5,1581894556.0,"Yeah, I finally figured it out, I don't know what happened when I entered the cave system, the game put me in a weird position, with my character facing the same entrance that I went through instead of the actual cave system. And I took that exit, thinking it was another area but it was actually the same way I came in. So I'm good now, thanks for the directions and the help!"
thelongdark,fhv7ptm,t1_fhv61s9,1581894248.0,Thanks for the help! I got a bit confused because I thought that I won't be able to go back to the mystery lake area ever again.
thelongdark,fhv739n,t1_fhv5bax,1581894000.0,"So I just got turned around somehow? Omg, I'm so stupid, lol. But the transition was weird though. When I went into the cave system for the first time (after the loading screen), the game put me with my back at the cave system and all I had in front was a long path that had a dead deer in the middle and an exit. I didn't expect my character to face the same way that I came in through, that was weird and got me really confused. Thanks for the help!"
thelongdark,fhv5fp7,t1_fhv4dr9,1581893463.0,"Oh, so it is possible to go back? That's great news. I really wanted my weapons and gear back. I have nothing on me besides a can opener. I'm in the Winding River area in a cave system."
thelongdark,fhuuc0x,t1_fhuq5un,1581890283.0,"I guess I didn't word that right, the frozen lake was the lake at the bottom of the path that I took after I left the dam. The one where the wolves are. After crossing the lake, I came across this tunnel. I went through it and it looked just like a normal tunnel that took me to a new area called the Winding River. I looked left and right and all I could see was a frozen river surrounded by high walls. And then I went back through the same tunnel but at the other end, instead of the exit that I went through the first time, there was a right turn that lead me through that cave system. Is it supposed to change like that? At first I thought that maybe I got back through another tunnel by mistake. But I knew it was the right one because it had a deer's body in it.

Edit: I just looked through my daily logs and here is the path that I went: Lower Dam (where I found the tunnel), Winding River (where the tunnel brought me), Cave System (when I went back through the tunnel, it somehow changed to the cave system), Winding River again because it's the only exit of the cave that I could find and back into the Cave system.. I am totally lost."

I've also had some issues finding an alien alloy that showed up on my radar but I couldn't find an entrance for it anywhere. It was to the right of the meat vortex where you have to kick a bird to open up the vines to get a goo and some resources. This was on the landing site as well. But when I got close to the wall it showed me that I was 34m away right behind that wall. But that wall had no entrance, no crawl space or a cracked wall that you could break."
