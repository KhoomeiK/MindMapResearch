Sorry if I don't answer to the dms. I wish I could just delete this post all together to erase all existence of myself but I feel like I'll look at this again when I'm down."

SuicideWatch,ezxve2p,t1_ezxus1k,1568250639.0,"It just seems like all the choices that I made led to my downfall. I had an ok life and everything was fine until I made a few bad choices and now I wish that I chose to study what I had an interest in. I always wanted to kill myself for no specific reason, just was tired of living but ever since I started working at my current company, I just regret everything that led to this. Everything I do, I wish I could undo or reset. I might make the same mistakes but at least I will still have a reset button to redo everything I do"
SuicideWatch,ezx9od2,t3_d2wpmh,1568235216.0,"I also feel that stress migraines are a mood and it's very disruptive to everyday activities. It just makes the day a whole lot worse when you wake up with a migraine and everything just hurts your head. Like for me, when I have migraines, if I see light I get sick, if I get in a vehicle I get sick. That's when I really wish I could just die and not deal with this shit"
SuicideWatch,ezx98a1,t1_ezx7ere,1568234921.0,I only became like this because I trusted people and was betrayed. I would rather stay away from people as far as possible and that is why I need a reset button. To maybe change how I think of people and not be afraid of betrayal
SuicideWatch,ezx8zdh,t1_ezx6kqf,1568234760.0,"I'm pretty sure if I got close to any guns, I'll probably shoot myself first since I've been trying to figure out a way to get a gun license just to kill myself. Also, I don't know if that would be the right decision for a person who just needs a method of suicide. Actually, it might be the easiest way to go and not be suspicious"

SuicideWatch,ezj3idu,t3_d18yg5,1567937970.0,"We have our ups and downs but don't dwell so much on the negative since it will pass... (I hope) and do an activity to take your mind off it. It might be able to help and it will distract you from that thought. Or speak to friends or even strangers about nonsense and it will take a load off your chest. There are days when I want to end it all and I tend to just call up a friend to talk about the future, what would be a good idea to just stop interacting with people. Talking about anything with others will make your day at least a tiny bit better. 

No idea is crazy. It's just how our minds are. All ideas even good ones can be called crazy but they are all just ideas. Just remember, if nothing works, let your feelings out without caring about anyone around you

Hope this helps you feel a bit better"

SuicideWatch,ezdr2cf,t1_ezdpsww,1567853926.0,"I just want to separate myself from everything and leave all my fake friends, I don't want to see them again but they will bother me until I give in to them. I just don't want to make more friends that will betray me. I feel like I just don't want to tell people what I'm going through since it's all useless. No one can help me anymore. There's nothing they can do, but the heavy feeling in my chest has lessened so thanks for talking to me this whole time. I might be able to sleep now since my heart isn't thumping anymore but it seems that my mind is just gone to the deep end and I don't know if I still will feel like isolating myself from the world"
SuicideWatch,ezdouz8,t1_ezdo0y0,1567853085.0,"I have days where I just breakdown and I can't stop crying. This normally happens when I try to seriously talk to anyone about these problems and I can't deal with this now. I just don't want to live like this anymore. Even now, I'm just typing this while crying and I don't even know why. So when I try to talk about this, I can't talk cuz I'm so busy with crying and I get anxious and can't sleep. I have insomnia and normally I get about 3 hrs of sleep before a 12 hr shift and I don't know how I can live like this any longer. My physical and mental health is deteriorating and I can't do anything since I need to work. There's nothing to do and all I do is work. Even my hobbies are dead, everything inside me is dead.

I'm the type of person who doesn't like risks and I will end my life once I find a way to definitely not come back but I just don't know anymore. There's no one I can talk to about this and therapy is making it worse. I just don't know what to do anymore. I lost my interest in hobbies, I can't trust my ""friends"", I probably will lose my job since they are so incompetent in helping me, and I will be a ball of sadness just wanting to do something that would make me somewhat useful becoming dirt.

I just wanted to help a bit since you're still young and maybe someday it would get better for you. Sometimes it might be hard to face one more day but think of any future events that you might enjoy and live until then. I don't know what you're going through but this might help...

Btw I feel how you feel, been thinking like this for more than 10 yrs and my therapist is worried about me being for the next appointment but to tell you the truth, I don't have a good method yet so I can really do anything. My friends are telling me that I'm whiney and trying to get attention but seriously, if someone just came up to me and killed me either by guns, knives, or cars, I would just not fight it and die right there so people worry whether I will do it or if I'm just saying it

So idk"

In our minds that is the best possible way to deal with it but if you think of just living one more day maybe something will be ok. Don't think of a positive way but of a way to see an outcome. Of course, you can just talk to someone more experienced than a kid but sometimes it's good to see in a different light. I personally would tell you that living is hell and if the world is giving you a hard time, maybe it would be better if it just ends (either the world or ourselves) but I'm pretty sure that someone would think I have a problem"
