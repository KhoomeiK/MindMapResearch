Most first world countries handled it barely skipping a beat, making us overconfident that we would be able to handle something similar without extreme measures like we have to now.

Politically, I completely agree, that’s what happened. But epidemiologists were certainly under no such illusion. We got lucky with SARS, and we knew the big one was still coming. They should’ve been listened to, like we would generals.

> The problem is that even in China where they are full Big Brother, they couldn't detect the disease before it was too late. When it comes to vaccine research, every company with the research capacity for mRNA vaccines has already dedicated a crapload of money to it. Companies like Moderna already had something on the books even before the outbreak, and they are already in phase 3 trials. Our pace on vaccine research can't really be any faster. There's no guarantee that a vaccine for SARS would work on COVID-19, and even if it did, it would take several months to push it through trials after an outbreak and a few more to put it into production.

I’m hesitant to say that China achieved maximal efficiency here. There are always new frontiers and ideas to try in health care, so a pervasive possible new disease alert network might be a thing. I’m no epidemiologist, but god knows no one has gone to a group of them and ever even asked “if you had $100 billion a year to achieve this, what would you do?” nonetheless gone the next step to ask for the $20 billion worth of best approaches. It’s never been given that kind of priority. But we’ve already spent 150x that on bailouts and we’re not done, so it might be warranted. With vaccine development - I’m not sure procedures could be faster, but rapid vaccine development and deployment should be a major subject of research (and funding therefor). With the SARS vaccine, the researchers certainly believed it would provide at least partial immunity, and they might have been unable to do clinical trials, but they might have been able to get a couple of rounds in and stockpile some doses to ring fence early outbreak areas in the early phases of a future pandemic. Certainly the research should’ve been finished/a priority.

You are right about the GPS guided AI for agriculture. That should be a national security priority. The food supply is the most important thing. Always. That said, there’ll still be plenty of non-automated stuff (fruit picking, rendering/meat packing, etc.). It’s still a vulnerability to be concerned about. And I can imagine a situation where the only way to get people to do essential work is to threaten them with no government aid, threatening starvation, or threatening them, which, threatening peasants to get back to work or we’ll starve/shoot you is aaaahhhhhh.

>Are you sure? We already have real-time studies of the Sun and plenty of scopes pointed at it. We already have a decent guess on probabilities of CMEs at any given time. If we could see a CME 18 hours before it hit the Earth, would that be enough time to harden our electrical grid?

I’m not sure, but I know a friend who was into that for a second at the beginning of grad school, and there isn’t much funding for it, so there may be a long way to come in that area. I’m not sure it would be enough time. People are still concerned about it, so clearly it isn’t simple to batten down the hatches. I need to do more reading on the Carrington Event.

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fpefbp4,t1_fpe82co,1588546446.0,"You’re making some interesting/good points. This, though:

> We ran out of ventilators because a severe respiratory pandemic was not considered a major risk (which will change). 

Iost me. A major respiratory pandemic, like flu or SARS has been a prediction since 1918, and was generally expected to have an of order 0.5% per annum risk. The dramatic shortages we have seen of PPE, ventilators, and other goods shows that we were not adequately stockpiled for such events. Standby production would be better than stockpiling for sure, but one or the other, or both needs to be enhanced. I don’t know about other essential supply stockpiles, but it’s easy enough to believe there are serious shortcomings given what we are seeing in the US now.

> The only thing we can do is to rollout repairs and replacements as quickly as possible, which the market would meet with increased manufacturing capacity from the temporarily higher prices.

You’re also losing me a bit here. You’re right that a Carrington Event can’t be built around in the grid infrastructure. Wires gotta be long. However, the Better heliophysics and space weather monitoring could alert us, or even allow us to predict serious storms. Systems which physically isolate transformers or otherwise put the grid into safe mode could also work. Your faith in the market to produce emergency goods (like replacement transformers) for such an event is a bit extreme. Ramping up production to reestablish a global power grid could take years at current production levels. Some equipment was even brought in to current substations by train tracks that no longer exist. For such infrastructure, identical replacements may be difficult to impossible to move into place. All of this is to say that outages could cripple global industry for months in a CE case, and such events tend to happen every 150-250 years, so they are not unlikely in a given lifetime.

> Hell, even that would be an easier problem to solve than covid-19. We don't even know what vaccine to make yet, and even when we do, no one will have enough precursor or manufacturing capacity to meet global demand. We are currently set up for the biggest bidding war the world has ever seen.

This is certainly an instance where emergency preparedness should have been a government priority. While expensive, the economic costs of COVID are already massive, and likely far outstrip the costs of mitigation through increased pandemic planning, better funded and more extensive global health initiatives to detect, isolate, and contain new pathogens using known epidemiological strategies, procedures and standby capacity for rapid vaccine research and production across multiple lines of inquiry in an emerging pandemic, and extensive vaccine research on threatening diseases. 

COVID, for instance was closely related to SARS (Geneva SARS-CoV-2. Researchers who lead a 2002? Effort to develop a vaccine said l, despite being close, the research was defunded after the SARS pandemic was successfully contained. The researchers suspect that vaccine would have provided at least partial COVID resistance, and the research might have shortened the path to a more ideal vaccine. This despite the fact virologists expected more SARS related viruses, and MERS and COVID have both emerged since. Avoiding a ~$30 million expenditure has cost us dearly, but this isn’t an unfortunate accident. Given the risk of a likely pandemic related to SARS, not continuing the project was a terrible cost/benefit. But limited budgets force demand limited scope, not necessarily in line with the threat. 

All of which is a long way back around to saying that despite the low risk, preparedness for pandemics (etc) like this demands a higher priority, and sober risk assessments have always indicated this given their human and economic costs. The money just wasn’t spent because of myopic perspectives which balked at spending precautionary sums (through taxes or directly by private businesses) to prepare for what would be an unusual but plausible, even likely, event in the lifetime of a person or firm. 

On the food supply thing, my point was less about just in time there and more about the dangers of these predictable black swan disasters to both industrial production and, more critically, food. With a bad enough pandemic (even just COVID, but it kills middle age people and children like the 1918 flu) getting enough labor to harvest enough food to feed the world could be a major problem, as workers chose to stay home and protect their families while subsisting off government emergency funds. The US is in a better position than most, but an agriculture crippled by shortages of various kinds due to widespread power outages lasting months or a severe pandemic which makes workers unwilling to come to work for anything less that exorbitant wages (imagine paying minimum wage strawberry pickers $30/hr and still having labor supply problems) could leave much food un-grown or un-harvested if enough people were scared enough, and in the best case could cause stupendous increases in food prices. Either way, it’s not beyond the pale to imagine widespread hunger."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fpe4big,t1_fpdid6o,1588540073.0,"I’m not describing insurance, I’m describing the lack of insurance coverage for these kinds of global events, and the general lack of resiliency, which puts the industrial economy in a precarious position and which requires government intervention in crises. My concern is as much about how strategies like just in time supply chains make shocks harder to endure. Also, the generally precarious nature of globalized industrial economies, in which actors are so often reliant on complex systems of far flung trade and operate on so ruthlessly on achieving the lowest possible price, at the expense of, as has often been noted, long term concerns and stakeholders, and more to this point, at the expense of any real consideration of resiliency to major global disasters. This is frightening given how dependent we are on these systems for even our bare survival. 

Imagine if this pandemic had a 10% mortality rate and primarily killed children or working age people. Finding workers to be involved in food processing, harvesting, etc could be very very hard. Few families would be willing to risk their children barring the use of extreme economic or physical coercion. In short, the very food supply could be at risk in such a scenario, threatening hunger even in the wealthier parts of the world. Perhaps especially there, given the urbanization. I could see a similar risk with a Carrington Event utterly crippling industry. The long argument being, these are serious threats, and our economic system is particularly vulnerable to/shortsighted about/generally uninterested in preparedness for them.

Also, we really should all be asking why we weren’t very prepared for this as a society. 9/11 sparked trillions of spending on wars and ‘national defense’ but left us open to a flu/respiratory pandemic which doctors have been calling the alarm about and predicting has like a 0.5-1% chance of happening in any given year since 1918.

The CDC bungled the deployment of testing because they pursued one route, rather than having the resources to pursue multiple routes with contingencies. When problems emerged, there weren’t three CDC produced tests flooding labs, giving them two more to try, there was delay and bureaucratic paralysis and we lost 5 weeks to track and slow the spread in February. But the CDC gets $7 billion, while military, CIA, etc gets 100x that. 

There’s a structural problem that this was never a priority because prole lives don’t matter. And because it was far cheaper for the wealthiest to weather the storm, but low, sell high, and not pay the taxes and insurance premiums and rainy day funds to prepare for such a disaster, and instead call it an act of god, take huge stimulus and bailouts, and let future generations and taxpayers pay it off, while they continue dodging taxes as much as possible to avoid paying.

I agree it’s probably the wrong idea based on what OP said, but it’s possible from OPs post that they could be in that category of people for whom the approach could work. It wasn’t being suggested in bad faith or to call OP an asshole. If anything, I read it as being like - if you read this and think, yeah, fuck no - it’s not about you. If you read this and think maybe, maybe it’s worth considering, or maybe not."

Look up a video a mathematician did on this - google “3 brown 1 blue coronavirus”. He explains in detail how if 20% of the people decide it’s not a threat and excercise their freedom, it robs the rest of us of the freedom to sacrifice temporarily (instead of for 15 months straight) to keep our loved ones safe. Seriously, watch the video, it’s interesting."

booksuggestions,fpahn70,t1_fp9r8j6,1588448364.0,"I mean it’s pretty authoritarian, and it’s not necessarily portrayed as bad. You could very much walk away from the novel with the idea that everyone would be better off in this planned society thing that’s so dehumanizing and that the paradox of meaning presented by the novel is only because we are so far away from that/sociologically primitive.

Like, I could imagine someone making the comparison that a hunter gather would look at a recent tweet I saw where a musician said something like “of course I love it, how many people get to work with their best friend every day” and say our society made no sense. They get to work with loved ones every day. We’re in anonymous boxes to make employers money, who cares if we have material goods. The hunter gatherers might see that the same way as we look at the idea of not having a mother or father as so completely foreign that the concept that it *could* ultimately be a worthwhile sacrifice is inconceivable (to those of us who had good parent relationships at least)."
