Of course its not always possible (depending on my mood) and I don't always say what I want, but its a practice and I'm getting better, especially with my husband.

If its better for me to wait, then I wait. If I open early then regret it and panic and don't know what to say, then I leave it on Read for as long as I want (which normally only ends up being around 5 mins). If I open immediately and respond immediately, I do worry that its ""clingy"", but then again, the other person will probably just assume that I'm already on my phone (or, more likely won't think anything of it at all, and may actually be happy for a quick response). And, worst case scenario (although its impossible to prove) is that this person really does get a clingy ""why is she responding so fast?"" vibe. But if you think about it, thats weird to assume that a quick immediate response is ""creepy"" or whatever. Its equally problematic on both ends, in my opinion, to wonder the reasons behind someone's texting habits."

I need to keep positive as often as I can so I like to think of my BPD as untamed super powers that I did not wish for, but since I have been ""gifted"" with them, I must control them.
