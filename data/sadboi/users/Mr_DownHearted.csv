depression,erdvnhu,t3_c1j5uu,1560760141.0,"Encountering these types of things are never easy. They may settle you in a Behavioral hospital or just keep a good eye on you. I've been in a behavioral hospital 4 times already and I'm still severally depressed and suicidal. I'm 17 and I'm too young to die I know that now. And so are you. But take what they offer. If not for ur sake, then for your loved ones who genuinely love you and enjoy spending time with you. You wont regret getting help. I've learned so much. And can teach so much about mental illness that I'm capable of helping others. I'm no therapist and I'm not qualified to be one but a little can help. You can do it my brody. Stay strong."
depression,erdv6w3,t3_c1i6n9,1560759362.0,"Dude first of all your father's shit cum bag. It's okay to be gay. Just like it's okay to be black or a Jewish person. Life is full of differences and I'd be pale and boring if it wasn't. And I get it dude. Being SAD (Suicidal And Depressed) is not a pretty place. I've been in that position for a long time now. To the point where I'm dead inside. Where love isnt even enough. And the hard part is. It may never go away. It's me, my brain and chemicals that I'm like this way. And I fucking hate myself so fucking much. Because I hurt so many people because I decided to try to take the easy way out. I've been in a behavioral hospital 4 times and I'm 17. I'm to scared to wear shirts because my arms are fucked up. And its getting hot living in Arizona. And I cant say that ur life or mine is gunna get better or not. Because I dont know. But I know that I'm too young to die. And so are you. It's hard waking up feeling like shit. Every day. People who truly care about me. And love me. That's why I stick around for. And I can tell you, u sure as hell are not alone my dude. So many people are going threw the exact same thing. I know so many people who are in your position. And there are people who genuinely love you and want to spend quality time with you. It's hard to appreciate in life when u feel like theres nothing there. Find a purpose in life. Be better then your father. Stick around so u can hang with your loved ones. Go through a beautiful forest filled with tall grass, flowers, trees and butterflies. The feeling of the sun settling on your skin will make u feel more alive. But you have to be alive for what it's worth. If not for ur sake, then for theres."
depression,erdu21t,t3_c1ji6c,1560757506.0,"I can relate to almost every comment about these topics. And I'm just awestruck of how many people are going threw the same thing. I cant say that its gunna get better or your life will have a happy ending because I don't know. I'm so dead inside love isnt even enough. But what I can tell u is your not alone dude. I see it as a certain kind of group. A special group. And that group is us. Helping each other. Because were not even living anymore. Were surviving of what evers out there. I've been surviving myself. For a long long time. And the sad thing is. It's me, my brain my emotions that's killing me. Nothing else. I'm 17 and I'm too young to die I know that now but i can live life in pain and mourn as long as I'm not alone. This special group is here for u my brody"
