intj,fpn9fbg,t1_fpmec52,1588754867.0,That's not a logical metaphor. You can't compare people to TV screens.
relationship_advice,fpftri4,t1_fpfsf03,1588583187.0,Oh are you a psychologist? It's very insightful of you. You must be an expert in reverse psychology too. You were the one who swore at me in your vert first comment. But forgive me that must have been some sort of psychological tactic of yours. Any way boo this was fun for five minutes whilst I was bored but really you have become far too attached to me and it's time I broke up with you. Don't cry too hard now xx
relationship_advice,fpfs4ms,t1_fpfrzjb,1588581508.0,"Yes darling. By the way, I did delete my post history. You reminded me there are some seriously obsessive and creepy people on reddit."
relationship_advice,fpfrl46,t1_fpfreke,1588580948.0,aww my feelings.
relationship_advice,fpfr0s6,t1_fpfqoe6,1588580372.0,I'll decide what's best for my life. Off you go now.
relationship_advice,fpfqyhh,t1_fpfqu4t,1588580307.0,"Thankyou, I have been following that tactic. I'm trying to be as sympathetic as possible whilst maintaining standards."
relationship_advice,fpfq6q2,t1_fpfq1uq,1588579528.0,Thankyou I appreciate your perspective üòä
relationship_advice,fpfq43l,t1_fpfpycd,1588579454.0,"Perspective is everything. I'm not claiming anything definitively, just a basis of understanding. I'm not sure why you have taken defense to this. My intention for this post was not to discuss personality types. I hope I have clarified myself enough to rectify how I offended you and we can leave it at that."
relationship_advice,fpfpo3i,t1_fpfpcem,1588579005.0,I should have worded the sentence more accurately. I do apologise for my lack of sensitivity in that regard. However as introverts INTJs have less need to seek out social rewards and INTJs are known to be significantly less willing to discuss trivial things or their internal dialogue.
relationship_advice,fpfp0wq,t1_fpfoqb2,1588578361.0,I didn't use the word inept did I. My intention was not to be rude or offensive unlike yours. Manage your insecurities.
relationship_advice,fpfoxf3,t1_fpfovhe,1588578265.0,Thankyou I appreciate your advise.
intj,fpfgmba,t3_gd5b43,1588570651.0,Validate her feelings whilst mainting and expressing your honest perspective. This shows that you care to explore her needs and uplift her however you respect her enough to be true to what you think is best. Don't expect her to take your word as gospel and act on it however. She will appreciate that you shared all perceivable options.
ENFP,foxdu6o,t1_fou57wn,1588141001.0,Thank you for your response ‚ù§Ô∏è I talked it out with him last night. The weird thing is that is does feel right. He also has aspergus so it adds another layer in the mix.
ENFP,fotl2jw,t1_fos4z3o,1588057275.0,Hi thanks so much for your in depth response it's so helpful. I would like to reach out and express how I feel about his bluntness however I have already done this a few times and then something new happens and I have to address that. I've only been seeing him for three months and we aren't a couple. I don't like the amount of pressure already built from us butting heads in the past and don't feel it's justified to ask so much of him to consider his behaviour so carefully when I'm such a new and relatively insignificant figure in his life and vice versa. I can certainly appreciate bluntness is a form of respect and compassion as I tend to be like this myself naturally and have trained myself to be softer in nature however he seems to be doing it from a place of selfishness not so much honesty. However it was clear to me he wasn't trying to be rude as he also said goodnight. He is 24 and I am 24 so there is certainly immaturity at play.
ENFP,fotkobq,t1_fot1288,1588056913.0,Thankyou. I have confronted him a few times about this kind of behaviour. He also has aspergus so it's a concoction that deserves time to be understood however its hard to draw the line from where he is being just rude or because of his dispositions.
ENFP,fnbvgp7,t1_fn7hwat,1586823121.0,You're welcome. I educated myself as soon as I was aware of the diagnosis but was motivated to dive into it because I am fascinated by psychology however I knew it would be extremely beneficial to know as much as i could. My mother has BPD also as it is genetic and she doesn't embrace her diagnosis at all. For her it  unfortunately took her attempting to completely destroy our family and her relationships for her to see that we will always be by her side. She went as far to become domestically abusive and cheating on my father and we all stood by her. The thing with BPD is that the people whom have it will do everything they can to destroy a good thing wether it's conscious or not because they believe the destruction of it to be inevitable so they would rather be the one causing it so they can control it but once they realise that they are loved unconditionally above all of their best efforts they feel safe and start behaving more healthily. This dynamic is of course incredibly unhealthy but is what happens alot of the time. Some great resources are on YouTube. If you look up Dr. Ramani on Medcircle she talks about BPD. Jordan Peterson although a controversial figure also has a good video on BPD you just have to search his name plus BPD. I hope this helps!
intj,fn6dfnr,t1_fn6cnrw,1586696181.0,Thankyou for your advise. I will give him time hopefully it's all for the best!
BPD,fn6btvt,t1_fkdwvqp,1586694785.0,"I needed to read that. Life changing, thankyou."
ENFP,fn6bav3,t3_fymoug,1586694294.0,I'm an ENFP with BPD. I am hyper aware of the negative impact my BPD has on my friends and family. I have to constantly remind myself to feel the emotion but not become the emotion on a whole. My relationships with my loved ones significantly improved once I educated myself deeply on BPD and have also made sure to keep my loved ones aware of the symptoms that they are directly affected by. I would recommend that you try to have an honest conversation with your SO. Reiterate that you love them and support them however feel that it would be beneficial to your relationship and your own mental health if they were able to maintain more awareness of the impact they are having on you when they are having an episode. If your SO is not well educated on their BPD encourage them to learn about it. It's incredibly enlightening and a relief to know that alot of the pain and fear we experience is a sympton and not often rooted in reality. Your SO will likely feel incredibly hurt and have their abandonment fears triggered by a conversation but hopefully appreciate the effort you have made to be open and honest because it indicates that you are looking to mend and heal your relationship and stay with them in a positive future. People with BPD can be incredibly selfish however they do love fiercely and can be very selfless because of it also so your SO should be more than willing to do the best they can to help you.
relationship_advice,fn62p67,t1_fn62mvh,1586685073.0,Yes it's very fortunate! Have you got people with you?
relationship_advice,fn62l0k,t1_fn62g0n,1586684949.0,I'm sorry to hear that it's not a fun time. Yeah I'm OK for an hour or so but then need my people. I live with my best friend so it's a big help haha!
relationship_advice,fn62ibj,t1_fn62fe1,1586684866.0,"Thankyou, yeah I am finding comfort similarly. I shall do my best! Thanks so much again ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
relationship_advice,fn62a8t,t1_fn6263o,1586684618.0,Thankyou. It's very difficult for me as I'm an ENFP with major abandonment issues haha but I'm trying. Thanks so much take care of yourself also.
relationship_advice,fn6270d,t1_fn6227y,1586684519.0,Thank you for your insight I really appreciate it. Yeah I have had a similar dynamic where I assume that his behaviours are indicative of his dislike of me due to my own insecurities despite him confirming that he does not dislike me haha. I'm trying my best to remain calm and not feel abandoned or stressed and give him time.
relationship_advice,fn620gh,t1_fn61wre,1586684318.0,Thankyou I really appreciate your advise that makes sense. The last message I sent was just to say I hope you're OK and take your time to talk when you're ready. So I'll give him time as needed.
relationship_advice,fn61heo,t1_fn612sl,1586683737.0,"OK potentially. He is usually pretty good at responding via text which is something that I understand not everyone with asd or who is an intj is good at so the fact that he is actively ignoring me is definitely indicative of something. If you dont mind me asking - Did you find that your partner didn't know how to proceed out of emotional confusion or social confusion?
Thanks so much for your advise too"
