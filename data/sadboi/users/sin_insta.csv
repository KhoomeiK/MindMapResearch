But the boundary was vague and Pakistan wanted Kashmir for themselves.This has been the grounds for many conflicts including some wars. You'll find that Himalayas is a line of defence in itself. So...both wants a part of that. Kashmiri people as specified by op had special privileges which has been revoked, kind of? Personally, this region is a ground of unwanted emotional political agendas. Indian army is being attacked left and right by the kashmiris as well as some dudes that sneaked in. (Trying not to imply anything) . But we've been taught that Pakistani terrorists are brainwashing kashmiris. Like I said, it's a matter of pride. No one wants to lose. I expect this comment to be downvoted to hell. But go ahead. 
I would love kashmiri culture to be part of ours. Fingers crossed for the outcome."
