Alcohol is without a doubt the hardest, worst drug I've ever experienced. The grip of physical dependence and total addiction was tramautic and ruined my life for years.

Physically it was horrifying too. By the time I quit I had a swollen liver, malnutrition, life threatening withdrawals, and a hole in my stomach lining that led to me throwing up a lot of blood. I had terrible anxiety and threw up at least a dozen times a day.
