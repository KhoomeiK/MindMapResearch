depression,fpp5mtm,t3_gcqww5,1588796382.0,Me too. I’ve just turned 25 in February and I feel like I’m getting older but my life still sucks. It’s been like this my entire life and it’s progressively getting worse. I feel like I’m standing still while the world around me is moving. I have a borderline personality disorder which makes matters and relationships with people much worse. I find myself isolated with no social life whatsoever.
