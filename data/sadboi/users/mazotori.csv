Aside from your own moral bias another user pointed out; 

- you state that imaginary friends are not capable of disagrement. This is not so much true. A better phrasing would be they are not independent. Even though they are not independent that doesn't mean they don't have their own opinions decided by the person with said imaginary friend.
- in the section on age, you state that tulpas are often ""not in the world too long"" and thus recent. Although they are typically younger than the host, they stick around, so they can be any age, and are not nessisarily recent.
- You write the answers the question with the bias that all tulpas are good and to be protected. Tulpas are beings and are shaped the world just like hosts are and are not inherently good or bad. For example when talking about how to treat a Tulpa you use language such as ""abuse"" to describe certain behavior, yet sections later when a question related to the same behavior from a Tulpa towards a host comes up it is referred to as ""unhealthy"". There is the bias that a Tulpa doing ""bad"" things is uncommon while there are many warnings against a host doing ""bad"" things.
- Some Tulpa like fronting all the time and would not view it as ""stressful"" and see it more as a learned experience
- self harm is not ""ridiculously improbable"" and the likelihood that a Tulpa and host would share this struggle is high. 
- when it comes to harm, you fail to acknowledge the possibility of verbal / mental abuse and instead focus on physical abuse
- some systems do split activities between system members, what makes this not slavery is consent and negotiation. Some Tulpas have interests and would like to front when that interest comes up.

ENM (ethical non monogamy, including polyamory) covers all sorts of relationship structures and identities but that is its own community. As a whole ENM does not share history, identity, struggles etc with the queer community, and thus it is not considered part of the alphabet.

Bisexuality is defined as ""more than one"". It does not inherently exclude trans individuals. There is tension around this identity over this misconception and many chose not to use it for that reason. There is also a generational difference in this perception, as well as some transphobia (the logic of this being; trans* people are not men or women and bisexuality is attraction to men and women so it excludes trans* and non binary people).

On the flip side the pansexual identity is assumed to be inclusive unless stated otherwise. Pansexual doesn't mean that the individual doesn't have preferences or is open to all identities, although that is often the case. 

If you are attracted to men or women but not trans people, you could say you are bisexual and not open to trans folks. Being explicit here is better than assuming that in the term."
