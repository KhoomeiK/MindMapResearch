As we learn more about a subject some of us become better at teaching and some don't.  Those who don't know the subject are the best identifying the material that presents the information is the best ""learnable"" manner.  Everything's easy to understand when you know it.  Beginners have that fresh set of eyes on an old problem.  They provide that critical need of unbiased criticism that can only make our training better.  I'd say that the advice of a beginner typically weighs more to me than someone with more experience.  They often know what's going to make the most sense to me, especially on a new topic."

I would argue that even with the requisite experience in all functional domains for each certification, the test structure is still an issue.  You could be an expert in the field and still fail because you've never taken a Microsoft or CompTIA Exam before.  Say you've been a Security Technician for 15 years and study for the CISSP for two weeks, then you answer every question from a technical standpoint instead of a managerial standpoint.  There is absolutely no way that someone could be trained and certified on all of these in 30 weeks. CISSP alone is a beast."

I've had Soldiers get out after two years for shin splints.  Ain't done shit, ain't killed shit, and ain't seen shit.  My father did 28 years in the military, could barely walk.  Had a back surgery right before he retired where they took his insides out and set them on his chest so they could operate on the inside of his spine.  He got 60%, he was Airborne.  Fought till just last year to get 100%, has small strokes almost daily, and waits in the VA incessantly.  

With all that being said, you answered the call.  The system is designed to take care of Veterans.  You're a veteran and you're absolutely entitled to whatever the Army and the VA say you're entitled to.  I'm sure the feeling is typical and normal.  I'm sure that people who have served 20 years and didn't deploy feel that way.  Hell I've deployed five times and feel that way sometimes, when I look at the guys missing legs or think about the guys in wheelchairs, or the one's that didn't come home.

Bottom line is it doesn't matter.  You earned it, and what other people think doesn't matter.  Enjoy the rest of your life.  The Army has already forgotten about you.

I don't have the time to train you up on all the tools, troubleshooting and competencies that someone typically learns at a HelpDesk.  The cyber security field is full of former automation support technicians and network technicians that moved into a more focused security field.

If you've got the money, and the intelligence, I'd really suggest trying to get that CISSP.  Right, wrong or otherwise this seems to be the gold standard for most companies.  If you pass, even without the required experience you receive  Associate of ISC2 status, and can work towards your experience requirement. Bottom line is the degree, or even certifications isn't going to get you much without some sort of background/experience in some of the IT domains.

I also agree with writing your own resume.  While professional resume writers may get the format right, no one knows yourself better than you.  No one can sell yourself, your talents, and what you bring to the table better than you.  Getting a job is all about telling them why they'd be stupid not to hire you.

The general spending picture changes substantially once one looks beyond Social Security and Medicare. [\[11\]](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/program-spending-outside-social-security-and-medicare-historically-low-as-a#_ftn11)At 11.1 percent of GDP, program spending outside Social Security and Medicare is already below its 40-year average of 11.9 percent and is projected to fall to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2029. (See Table 1 and Figure 1.)

This decline reflects a substantial drop in annually appropriated, or “discretionary,” programs. These programs encompass almost all of national defense and a wide variety of other federal activities, including most federal support for transportation, education, natural resources, veterans’ health care, law enforcement, general government, and international programs. Expenditures for these programs are expected to fall from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2019 to 5.0 percent in 2029. In 2019, spending on these programs will be near the lowest level on record as a percent of GDP, with data going back to 1962, and will continue dropping each year thereafter.

I’ve been in about twenty years and it’s always made sense to me to put my fucking hands in my pockets when it’s cold outside. Be a real fucking leader and worry about efficiency, effectiveness and team cohesion.  Get the fuck out of here with that dumb shit."

I don't know what your workplace environment is like but I've never worked anywhere that I've got anything other than strange looks.  I know that as a manager I'd never do anything but encourage my employees to seek a healthier and more productive lifestyle.

They talked about a trust star or something that has helped me a lot with relationships.  Had something to do with the amount of trust you can give people.  Basically, you don't have to trust people all the way.  Trust everyone differently.  We had a saying in the Marine Corps.  I'll trust you with my life but not my money or my wife.  Yeah...that."

Things that we used to think are important, we know aren't.  We've got focus, that others will never have.  The hardest thing for me to do is keep my mouth shut around civilians, on a daily basis.  This includes my wife and children as awful as that sounds sometimes.  How can you not just follow directions.  How can you not just wait and listen to the rest of the instructions before trying to do something?  Why does it take ten of you to figure out how to get the computer to work.  Just know you're not alone, the frustration, the struggle is real."
