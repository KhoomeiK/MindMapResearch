WritingPrompts,fmqhz4h,t1_fmqhxe2,1586299973.0,"A voice from the other side of the house interrupted his train of thought.

“Pizza’s here!”, yelled Ed, his brother and roommate.

Ed had been living on his own for a few years, and Dave had recently joined after moving out from their Dad’s place. Both of them were successful and made good money, but Ed had always gone to more parties, had more girlfriends, and made more people laugh than Dave ever did.

“So how’s the novel?”, Ed asked as he bit into the first slice of gooey pizza.

“It’s going great, it’s almost done. I’m gonna send it to a bunch of publishers soon.”

“Oh yeah? That’s great. What did Chris think?”

“Chris can go fuck himself.”

Ed laughed mid-bite then put his slice down, stringy cheese still connected from his mouth down to his plate.

“So he didn’t like it? Why not, what’d he say?”

“He said it was cliched.”

Ed laughed again.

“Well it is, dude. The parts you showed me, I felt like I was reading *Wheel of Time* fan-fiction or something. Except people’s names were changed.”

That annoyed Dave. Ed didn’t know what he was talking about.

“How would you know? You don’t write, you barely even read.”

“I just know.”

“Alright, why don’t you try writing a book then. That isn’t cliche. If you know so much about it.”

“Yah sure, maybe I’ll give it a whirl.”, he said, still chuckling.

“I’d love to see it when you do.”, Dave said with biting sarcasm.

Over the next few weeks Dave stayed in touch with Chris, but he grew increasingly frustrated as Chris’ criticism didn’t relent. His frustration evolved into hostility and he stopped sending drafts to Chris. But eventually, he just felt defeated. Maybe Chris was right. No, Chris probably *was* right.

Dave took a break from writing. He became more productive at work and fantasized less. He even asked Maddie the receptionist out for Coffee and she said yes. They met at the corner cafe right after work.

“So what do you like to do for fun?”, Dave asked to fill in an awkward pause. Unlike his brother, he was never good at talking to girls.

She looked up from her latte. She looked like she was spacing out.

“Oh, well, I like to do yoga, and I’ve started to get into baking again recently.”

“That’s really cool.”, Dave said, doing his best to feign interest in those topics.

He was running out of things to say.

“What about you?”, Maddie said to keep the conversation going.

“I really like to go on hikes, go fishing, outdoors kind of stuff.”

“Oh cool. I love to go hikes.”, Maddie said as her eyes wandered back down to her latte. Dave could tell she was feigning interest too.

He paused, then added, “I’m also writing a novel.”

Maddie’s gaze moved away from her latte again, and this time found Dave’s eyes. She was smiling, interested.

“Oh wow, really? What’s it about? I didn’t know you were a writer.”

He suddenly found it easier to speak.

“It’s fantasy, like Lord of the Rings. But it’s not like Lord of the Rings, I spent a lot of time crafting my own world. It takes place in a place called Tamrea, and the magic system is based on -” 

He cut himself off, he was getting carried away.

“Sorry, I used to be really into it and spent a lot of time on it. I can talk about it forever. I haven’t worked on it in a while though.”

“Why not? That sounds amazing!”, Maddie said, still smiling. 

Dave paused again, thinking. Maddie was looking at him, engaged in their conversation for the first time since they’d sat down.

“I don’t know actually. I guess I just got busy with other stuff.”

“You should keep working on it!”

“Yah, I guess will, I was planning on working on it more tonight actually.”

When Dave got home that evening he opened the fridge, grabbed a beer, cracked it open with a loud reverberating pop, and sat down at the kitchen table with his laptop. He was going to write again. And he was excited about it.

Ed walked in the kitchen.

“Pizza’ll be here in fifteen.”, he said as he opened the fridge and popped open his own beer. Then with a small leap he sat down on the kitchen counter.

“Cool. Hawaiin right?”, Dave asked.

“Yup.”

“Good.”

Ed took a swig of the beer, and let out a very purposeful “aaah”.

“So by the way.”, Ed paused for a second. “Chris loves my novel.”

Dave was in a good mood, so he played along. Ed was obviously joking. He had to be.

“Oh yah? That’s amazing, congratulations. When’s it getting published?”

“I’m not kidding man. He loves it and he sent it to a big publisher a couple days ago. They love it too. Here look at this.”.

Ed took out his phone, pulled up an email, and showed it to Dave. Dave read it. Ed wasn’t joking. By some miracle, or divine intervention, or all of the above, Ed wasn’t joking. Dave felt his jaw slightly drop.

“Holy shit, what, how.”, Dave said confusedly.

“I guess I just have what it takes. What are you working on by the way?”

Dave looked at his novel which he had just opened on his laptop. He remembered the feeling he got seeing Maddie’s eyes widen when he told her he was working on a novel. He remembered how he felt, just 3 minutes ago, sitting down at the kitchen table with a newly found motivation to continue writing. He remembered all that and tried to hold on to it. Suddenly, those feelings were starting to feel fragile.

He remembered how he felt when he got the criticism from Chris. Angry, frustrated, defeated. He remembered the feeling of giving up. Then he looked at the story he had just opened up on his laptop, for the first time in weeks.

“Well it’s funny. I’m working on my novel too.”"
WritingPrompts,fmqhxe2,t3_fqpjc3,1586299946.0,"Dave was as stereotypically nerdy as it gets. Computer programmer, Lord of the Rings trivia master, and clueless with women. His cashmere sweaters, thick rimmed glasses, and unkempt curly hair fit the part too, although might’ve added a bit of a hipster twist.

He lived in his head, as most nerds do. He would daydream at work about the next episode of Game of Thrones, his recent win at Friday Night Magic, or sometimes fantasize about asking the receptionist Maddie out for coffee. But above all else, he would dream about writing the next great fantasy series.

He knew his novel would be grand, romantic, and captivating. It would be hilarious and deathly serious at the same time. It would be the next *The Name of the Wind* and he would be the next Patrick Rothfuss. He’d plan what to say in his future interviews and book talks. He’d even plan what he’d do with the money from the book sales and royalties from the TV and movie adoptions. It was all he did and just about all he thought about.

The story had a typical cast of characters: a wise wizard, a cocky rogue, and a beautiful elven ranger. There was certainly adventure too, including a journey to a dragon’s lair and a midnight operation to kidnap a foreign nation’s prince. Dave was proud of what he had made. The only problem was his editor, Chris, wasn’t.

“Dave, I like the characters. I like the story. I like the setting. Shit, I probably like everything in this book. But that’s the problem. I don’t *love* anything. I don’t love anything because I’ve read about this story, characters, and kingdom at least one-hundred times before. Your story is cliche Dave”, said Chris.

Dave found Chris on Craigslist through an ad that offered fantasy novel editorial services for $25 an hour. They had been working together for a few months. Chris was a nerd like Dave, but with less of the hipster fashion sense. All Chris did was read, read, and read. He knew the fantasy genre like a dwarf knows an axe.

“OK, fine, let’s change some things, what can we change?”, Dave countered.

“I really think the best thing to do is scrap everything and start over. You’re a new author, this is nice, but it won’t get published. This was your first book. Take everything we’ve talked about over the past few months, and apply it to something new.”

“I don’t really want to write something new. I want to keep working on this.”

“So keep working on it, let it be your passion project, but if you want to get published, this isn’t the way to do it.”

They argued for another 20 minutes until they ended their Skype call. Dave was more frustrated than disappointed because he knew Chris was wrong. He had to be wrong. So many hours spent on it, so much time, so much brainstorming, plotting, world building."

BrainFog,fgyp452,t3_f0s4ko,1581185428.0,"Yes i get this too although I wouldn't describe them as racing thoughts. it's more like...I'm observing a half-dream that I can't control - both thoughts and just imagery that pop into consciousness. In contrast, 'racing thoughts' at least have a qualitative feel that I am the one manifesting them, that I am generating them with conscious action, even if it sometimes feels like I can't control it. I guess it's a type of hypnagogic imagery, although even that doesn't seem to describe it exactly.

Lately it's been happening almost every night immediately when I close my eyes to sleep.

Ocassionally, it feels like the same thing, these dream like thoughts, spill over to my fully waking life in the middle of the day. But it's not very common and very subtle.

Sometimes they keep me from sleeping because they startle me or bring up some anxiety. Honestly, it often seems like my problem with anxiety is downstream of this stuff. Caused by it rather than primary anxiety. But it's probably a two way street.

I used to get up from bed and eat a big bowl of oatmeal when it was really bad and just keeping me from fully relaxing. I am fully convinced it very much helped although I don't know the mechanism.

Another good technique is to just resign to it, tell yourself you will just simply ""watch"" the dreams/racing thoughts start coming up and fully stop trying the to control them at all as your drift off.

Oh and I also get the half dreaming half awake thing. I feel like my sleeps from around 5 am to 7am have been like that every morning lately. Also have mild IBS"

Supplements,f0jt4mc,t3_d3oh6o,1568662420.0,"Interested in this. I noticed a possible correlation between muscle twitches and Vit D as well. I had been doing 5k IU for quite a while and had gotten my levels up to 48 ng / ml. I did however, at the same time, have very annoying muscle twitches. I'm pretty sure I was taking magnesium citrate at the same time, but don't fully remember. I wasn't taking K though. 

Who knows if it was the D, but I stopped supplementing and slowly the twitches stopped. But now, my levels are suboptimal again at 28 ng / ml, and I've been having issues with my mood and sleeping, so I have started D again to hopefully help with this. This time I may add in some K2 though. And maybe some magnesium in the morning and at night. 

I do think it's a calcium problem at the core for me though. I've always had something going on with my calcium metabolism, not sure what. I remember taking a normal dose of a calcium supplement for just 2 days once and it immediately caused heart palpitations and twitches. These immediately ceased when I stopped supplementing calcium."
SIBO,ezwd8bj,t1_ezvctcd,1568213947.0,"Thanks for chiming in. I haven't added intermittent fasting into the mix yet, although I used to do it a lot. Lately though I have just been feeling too shitty (brain fog, complete inability to concentrate, anxiety), and honestly I'm certain, for whatever reason, food was helping me to self medicate, as long as the food was something like rice or easy to digest protein, at least. It really helped quite a bit. So I was eating a lot for that reason. I am going to try 16:8 fasting again though, starting today, as I've been feeling quite a bit better (not nearly perfect though), and giving my gut time to relax, and hopefully for a little autophagy to take place sounds like it couldn't hurt.

I haven't tried many probiotics except the regular Culturelle one which I have been taking every morning for a month and a half or so. I seem to tolerate it fine. Other supplements I've been taking which seem to help are some high quality fish oil (600 or so mg of total omega 3's, might start taking more), 2000 IU Vitamin D, and 1 G Vitamin C. And magnesium with tart cherry juice at night.

I don't get anything like full body pain, no.

And about the chocolate - what symptoms did you experience with it exactly?
