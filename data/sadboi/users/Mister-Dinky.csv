There is a reason as to why we have these rules, and we can only enforce these rules as long as we stick to them.

I am always willing to discuss things and be lenient if the situation calls for it, but you don't have to be so unnecessarily rude, just because I reminded you of our subreddit rules. Calling me a joke or a Karen (while it technically would be a Kevin since I am a dude) will not help your case in restoring it.

Since it was me who forgot to turn of the polls, it would be unfair to punish you for posting a poll and others for replying to it.

I also do not like it that you claim that those people live in a fragile world. The fact that they try to help themselves by consulting these forums for advice is one of the first steps they have to take, which follows admitting that you need help. That takes a strong person.
