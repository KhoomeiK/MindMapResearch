I've watched it a few times now just to see if it ""grows"" on me.... And it does not. I'm just getting more and more disgusted.   


I guess someone will call me a pussy, but..... Personally I dont think I am, one of my passions are horror movies and the more disturbing and sick they are, the better. I'm not easily disgusted or scared by something. I have a high tolerance for controversial stuff. This porn video by Till is fucking awful and nasty. The end."

I've looked up to him for such a long time, however after the Platz Ein video I kinda saw just a perverted 50 year old man fucking young girls because he can. But after reading your entry I see it slightly otherwise.   


I also believe this is the effect Till have on some of his fans, like me. I got provoked, angry, felt kinda bad about the whole situation and started to rethink my love for Lindemann and their music, and Till Lindemann himself. I'm a huge fan of Rammstein, and they provoke too, but not in the same area as Lindemann. I've never felt bad about loving Rammstein, but I've felt bad about loving Lindemann. I'm a woman myself and I guess that's part of why I feel the way I do, the constant  ""sexualization"" of women and showing them naked at all times.... But then again, I felt like Knebel almost praised women in some sort of way (my interpretation of the lyrics and music video). I love Knebel, it's my favorite song by Lindemann, it's pure perfection.

However when it comes to depression, you can only deal with your depression through your own head. It's not like your brain is detached (might feel like that sometiems). Some people just want to help out and people who haven't suffered from depression obviously can't relate or understand 100% what's going on BUT they symphatize with you and try their best to motivate you. I mean if someone tries to take you out for a walk or tries to make you laugh or send you cute pictures of cat and dogs, they are just trying their best to make you feel better...  


And then again, there will always be those ignorant idiots who really doesn't care or won't understand just because they don't want to. I'm talking about those who try. Being close to someone, in family with someone or friends with someone who suffers are also though and not everyone who suffers are able to tell how they feel or explain, and then accuse people for not understanding.
