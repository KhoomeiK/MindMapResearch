The submissive rat might squeak in protest but she will let the dominant rat know if it's too much. The bitey girl might be a bit too forward in telling the other shes boss, but if it's just a bit of hierarchy sorting, it should mellow out.

If it persists and the dominant girl is acting aggressive to her and maybe even you I would think theres a hormonal problem if they are young adults. Some dominant rats are just like this though, bossy and persistent."

Do they only bite when you put your hands in the cage? Or will they bite while being handled/in a free roam area?

RATS,fpresqg,t3_gf2je3,1588852162.0,"If you teach them that hands bring treats, they'll see them positively. Get them to come to you for a treat, only when they approach your hand will they be rewarded. They'll soon learn that hanging around you is a good experience and you could probably work up to having them eat a treat while sat in your hand. Honestly teaching them tricks is the most fun way for both you and you rat to bond with each other :) 

If they're extra skittish its important to have extra patience and try not to raise a hand over them/their head, one little frustrated move or anything that spooks them when they're not in their safe space will send you backwards in progress.

Danger signs are extremities turning blue from lack of oxygen. Lots of saliva is good as shes working the blockage down, it can look very distressing but they can usually handle it fine.

There are maneuvers you can do to try and help but honestly I would refrain from interfering as we can do damage to their delicate throat, they are greedy buggers and well adapted to removing blockages. Have a vet on call if she doesnt look like she can remove it or looks as though shes having trouble breathing.

Often Baytril (enrofloxacin) does best with a secondary medication like Doxycycline as well, since Baytril doesnt always do the job on it's own depending on what the infection is caused by.

I'm no expert, just a long time rat owner and have experienced many an infection unfortunately. Perhaps if you mention any of the above to your vet they will be able to determine if anything else can be administered :)

If he is still eating/drinking by himself then encourage him with both regularly.
