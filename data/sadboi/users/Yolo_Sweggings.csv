NarcissisticAbuse,fqykz5p,t1_fqx0pt2,1589750291.0,"Can relate with running4z, the same happend to me. The only regret I have is not breaking it up any sooner than I did. I’m still suffering from the trauma and I broke up with the dude about 3/4 years ago and the relationship lasted 11 months. It is totally understandable that these things may not seem like red flag for you OP (didn’t seem like it to me either at the time), but THEY ARE. It will be hard to end things with your partner right now, and you’ll probably feel guilty the in the beginning or maybe even a couple of months. You will get over this!!! You’re strong enough to “rebuild” from this BS your partner does to you rn. Please make sure, that once you are ready to talk, to see a professional too. They will help you learn to differentiate between normal and abusive behaviours. And also how a person SHOULD be treated when engaging in normal behaviour. I really hope you’ll find the strength to make this decision and put your foot down."

While reading your text one of my memories came back (I developed amnesia bc of my youth). What you describe is the opposite of what my Nmom did. I had to ride the horse (her horse btw which she made the kids take care off the entire week) and I had my period. Using sanitary towels and horseback riding are a horror combination. I was never allowed to use tampons, Nmom forbade me. So as I finally had the courage to ask her for one, so I could ride the horse without causing a bloodbath and chafed skin, she gave me the biggest tampon she had. It was the largest size one can buy (and I know because I have been standing in front of the isle of the supermarket so many times, so extremely hesitant if I would one of the package but never did). I was 16 as this happened and had a boyfriend. As she handed me the tampon she told me to just think about my boyfriend so I would get wet and then push the tampon as hard as possible inside me until I couldn’t push any further. She also said it was normal that my inside may be dry and that I just had to keep pushing bc that would do the job. So I went to the toilet and did what she said. Within a minute I was back out again and she was flabbergasted that I pulled it off. Like open-eyed wonder-stricken. She even asked check questions. It did hurt to put it in, it was very unpleasant to say the least. Walking after was a bit funny. But I didn’t tell her that as she asked me if it hurt. I shrugged my shoulders, told her something like “nah” and walked away to get ready for horseback riding."
raisedbynarcissists,fpus4ej,t1_fpugs3b,1588921851.0,"Same here. Because of the stuff my Nmom did the way I use and used diaries changed. Instead of writing personal stuff down I started to use it as a collection of memories with hardly anything written into it. So I would for example put a ticket from a movietheatre in there and write the names of the people that saw that movie with me next to it. Nothing was safe in my home, not even the hiding places you are all talking about. My Nmom would find them eventually in her search for money or anything valuable in my room she could get money for. Even until this day I don’t dare to write anything personal down because I am afraid still afraid too - just like you are saying. And I too live by myself for several years now - 8 years in fact, since she put me on the street at my 18th birthday without any warning. In her reality being 18 years ment that I was an adult and therefore she wasn’t obligated by law to care for me anymore (which wasn’t true bc it’s age 25 but hey she didn’t care at all). Until this day, I still can’t wrap my head around this way if thinking. I don’t think I ever will."

ptsd,fk4oj4h,t3_fggcfi,1583864509.0,"I can relate too. I don’t like it at all. However, changing my mindset did help cope better when this happends. Just a while ago I would get really triggered by it and feel unsafe. I told my newest therapist about it and she told me that there is no need to feel unsafe because these man “just” look at you. They don’t act on it. That did not take my fear away though. So my therapist started talking about how I am lifting weights (also coping) and that the majority of men won’t even be able to overpower me, since I have gotten so strong. That really hit me. As soon as a guy looks at me in the manner you described, I think back about she said and I don’t feel scared anymore. A group of guys or a muscular guy is a different story, but at least I am OK with the average looking once (I still don’t like it at all though). Maybe lifting weights and thinking about it this way may help you too. It is a BIG relief for me and I wish you the same!"

ptsd,fhwt2yr,t1_fhulzob,1581928859.0,Ah man that really sucks. I hope you will find the right therapist that can help you and you will feel comfortable to share your story with. Stay strong!
ptsd,fhul33k,t1_fhtsa6s,1581887527.0,Maybe it is worth trying EMDR (with following a light and not the clicks/sounds) with your therapist. I have used it for one of my triggers and since then my response to it is minimal. That was two weeks ago and I am still not having a more than minimal respond to the trigger.
BPD,exfltpb,t1_exf6j68,1566243369.0,"Like what skills? I am really curious about your advice as I havent learned any skill or had psycho-education on this topic, but I did get the diagnosis about four years ago and I am struggeling with this issue too"

I will need some time to find something that will help me deal with my moodswings in many different situations (work, school, home, with friends and so on), so that may be a challenge but I’ll find it :D"
Borderline,evw9vzz,t1_eve2jld,1564858788.0,Thanks! I will try to give this a shot in the near future :)

Borderline,evdmuz2,t3_b0o484,1564442153.0,"Me too and it pretty much sucks bc people dont see or notice what I am going through and therefore assume I am doing fine etc, while I might be trying to pull myself together to not have a breakdown, burst into tears or sth like that. Like, I have no issues with expressing happy feelings but as soon as it starts to go towards the “meh” and negative onces, I point inwards. Apparently my facial expression and body language dont give anything away about this mood change. My brother sometimes notices my mood change and my boyfriend starts to learn it too, but those are the only two people who do. If I start to open up a little bit towards other people, they always tell me I am exaggerating my feelings or being a pessimist or that is all bs, that I am just seeking attention ;( I have even been called a liar! Even most of my therapists tell me I seem to be fine and of no need for therapy bc I dont show any emotions when talking about the bad stuff bc I internalize everything. so, there’s that :("
