I lost my dad a few years ago, I spent a lot of the time he was sick being mad at him. By the time I got to see him he was put on so much medication that he could barely comprehend that I was there, I spent his final days alive with him holding his hand and taking care of him however I could but I have to live now knowing that I never got to reconcile, apologize, truly show him how much I love him. Things like that. 

I hope that your dad recovers, I wish this will happen. I hope my response doesn‚Äôt hurt you I just hope you can see past your feelings toward him in this moment as hard as it is.

painting,fqzffmd,t1_fqzf0cb,1589766242.0,"In school it makes sense because they show you all sorts of tricks to learn. I can see it being beneficial for learning to paint but I think a real artist should be going through the struggles of proportions and portrait drawing, not just tracing through the hard parts and onto painting. (I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre not a real artist - hope you see what I mean cause you were learning at that time). It is just different when people way beyond the learning in school point are still doing it. 

To me it‚Äôs like selling someone a bird house that you built from scratch and painted, but you actually bought a pre built bird house from the art store and just painted it - skipping a large part of the process and one of the harder parts."

I dabble in procreate because I wanted to learn it for fun, and it‚Äôs really easy to spot all these artists on IG with thousands of followers who just very clearly trace and blur and paint over pictures in photoshop/procreate. But you‚Äôre right, how could all these amazing portrait artists pop out onto Instagram over night.. where were they hiding this talent? I hope you know what I mean. 

But I totally agree with you, people want the fastest and quickest likes and feedback. It‚Äôs just a shame because a lot of them are profiting off of it. I‚Äôve spent the last 8 years of my life trying to be a better portrait artist and now people can just trace and be better than I am.

PurplePillDebate,fqrzsdc,t1_fqryir6,1589595411.0,"I feel like some of you need to get out into reality cause this whole Chad thing is ridiculous. 

I‚Äôm a woman who has been in a few relationships, as well as I‚Äôve had friends who were the ‚ÄòChad‚Äô you all talk about. 

As for the friends of mine who were ‚ÄòChads‚Äô, they had no issues getting sex and had women practically throwing themselves at them the entire time I knew them. They still chose to watch porn and masturbate despite getting sex from women of their choice. 

As for men in relationships, many of them will choose to watch porn no matter how much sex they have and no matter how much that porn actually in turn makes them suck in bed as well as ruins their sex life. You‚Äôre biased based on your own personal beliefs, but in reality they‚Äôre wrong. Porn addiction is a real thing and it‚Äôs different. You can read tons of women on r/deadbedrooms desperate for their husbands to fuck them and many of the times he won‚Äôt, and can only get hard while watching porn and jerking himself off. Plenty of those men go soft in front of a real pussy but can get themselves off watching porn."
HealthyFood,fqqvnp4,t1_fqquudp,1589572780.0,"You can also be a sous chef at Denny‚Äôs, so I‚Äôm not really impressed. 

I‚Äôm not even trying to act like I know a lot about food, but considering my best friend growing up was Vietnamese and I‚Äôve eaten these rolls in different cities in various Vietnamese restaurant, it means absolutely nothing that some person who likely doesn‚Äôt prepare Vietnamese food is trying to say what would make it ‚Äòlook‚Äô better. There‚Äôs nothing chopped or diced in the rolls, they‚Äôre usually made with things sliced thinly so it doesn‚Äôt all come falling out. 

I‚Äôm aware there are right and wrong ways to prepare things, but you being a chef and thinking something would be better than the common way of doing it doesn‚Äôt mean people preparing their own food from their own culture is wrong. You clearly googled the wrong thing and just won‚Äôt admit it because you‚Äôre too far up your own ass, because I also googled it and didn‚Äôt see a single thing about pur√©e shrimp or diced shrimp, they‚Äôre all presented in exactly the same way except the ones that don‚Äôt include shrimp at all. 

Making food professionally makes you an expert on all foods of all cultures? I doubt it. I also personally know 2 chefs who work in Michelin star restaurants and I doubt they‚Äôd have the level of pretentiousness that you carry in your comments. What next, are you gonna go to an Indian restaurant and tell them they‚Äôre preparing their butter chicken wrong cause you don‚Äôt like the way they cut the chicken breast? Lmao"

Not a single one I saw had chopped or diced shrimp. We are not talking about mushroom wellingtons right now, nobody gives a fuck about mushroom wellingtons.

What helps me stay on track is saying fuck it to certain things. I‚Äôll make sure to stay within my 1200 (my actual limit is 1400) I used to get really down on myself if I got to 1225 or something just barely over, lately I tell myself that as long as I‚Äôm under 1400 but aim closer to 1200 it‚Äôs a win. I also make sure I stick to my fasting. Those are the two things I do aside from working out. I‚Äôd get too overwhelmed if I was focusing on macros, and sodium intake, etc. If half my calories go to ice cream, or sweets, I just let myself have it. I‚Äôm losing weight and maybe my method isn‚Äôt the best, but this is what‚Äôs made it easier for me to not binge and give up. It‚Äôs hard to make sure you are doing everything right all the time and I think this makes it more likely that you‚Äôll ‚Äòslip up‚Äô. 

Also it‚Äôs hard not to, but don‚Äôt beat yourself up. Just keep trying again, that‚Äôs the most important part as cliche as it probably sounds. I can tell you are frustrated but don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. Losing weight is not easy, and as long as you keep trying and don‚Äôt give up then you‚Äôre doing great. It doesn‚Äôt matter who lost what faster than you. At this time last year I was 10 pounds away from my goal weight (125) after losing nearly 35 pounds (I started around 165-168). I gained back 25 of those over a stressful time period and also just fucking up my diet again, and the last couple times I weighed myself it fluctuated closer to my original weight (I weighed around 158 once and it broke my heart). My point is, it‚Äôs normal to fluctuate and ‚Äòmess up‚Äô and not everyone is doing as great as it may seem like they are. Just keep trying, that‚Äôs what counts the most."
