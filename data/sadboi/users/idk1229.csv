SuicideWatch,fnnw0hb,t1_fnls7le,1587103471.0,Yup. I'm alowly realising that is how life is and will be.
Coronavirus,flq3ks4,t1_flpzbs4,1585377755.0,"Move? When people migrate to the U.S, others tell them ""fix your country, stop coming here"". When people say they dislike the U.S you say move? NO! Using the same logic as the ones who don't want people to migrate here. I say we stay and fix the country. The country can be a lot better."
BlackPeopleTwitter,filch6z,t1_fik10ah,1582498465.0,"For a chance to live in a better, more fair country. I am up for it. None of us asked to be born, so why make it difficult for some and not for others? Honestly, I used to be a trump supporter, that was the selfish side in me. I am slowly realizing how bad this country is. And how the future generation's should have it easier and a better place to live. That is not being selfish. That is looking out for the future and your fellow humans."

AskMen,fbe5t4i,t1_fbdyfho,1576778838.0,"Something else that helps is not judging others and knowing that people will judge you. Keep your head up and don't give a f what they think. Knowing that every1 is different and has different perspective helps too. I'm getting better, but just like many things, it takes time. So much better than b4, It's a big relief, I still have to get better at not caring though."
SuicideWatch,exxf9at,t3_cuh4ch,1566635002.0,"Why do you have a kid just to kill yourself? Give your kid the life you never had. I know exactly how you feel. For months I tried finding the meanig of life and I won't lie to you. I never did find it. Most people find there meaning in children. I don't have none so now what?? I decided to just live this fuckn life and wait for the end of the world to come or until I die. You however have a meaning right in front of you. Your kid. Take time to think about it. Time tends to suppress your wounds and makes you think clearer. Do you want to leave your bf and kid behind? Clearly they care for you. Our biggest fight is ourselves. you're not alone! We all have our fights. I have suicidal days too. If others can do it, so can you. Ive been there just like many of us had. We have suicidal thoughts. I've noticed these thoughts are like a virus that get stronger the more you feed it. One thing that has helped me is time and relaxation. If it was up to me I'd make everyone's pain go away, but it's not. There's only so much the outside world can do, the biggest fight is for you. You can beat it little by little, as I am doing. You'll sometimes fall back, but the fall backs will be less harsh because you became stronger. Remember, you're not alone in these fights. Many of us are fighting too. If others can, so can you."
