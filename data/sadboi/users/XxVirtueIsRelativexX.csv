GenderCritical,ey1iv3z,t3_cv2uv4,1566700833.0,"There was a study done, ""The frequency of personality disorders in patients with gender identity disorder"" and it was 70% for FTMs and 89.7% in MTFs with the majority of them being Cluster B personality disorders (Narcissistic, Antisocial, Histrionic, Borderline - the low/no empathy personality disorders).   Tactics from the Narcissist's handbook: gaslighting, projection and deflection, word-salad, controlling everything, minimizing others' worth, public and private shaming, third party reinforcements, perpetuating the role of victim, deliberately misrepresenting others' thoughts and feelings to the point of absurdity, covert and overt threats, name-calling, pushing and ignoring boundaries, etc.  (All things commonly witnessed in the TRA community).

GenderCritical,ey1fsck,t1_ey1aesc,1566698494.0,"I would imagine they would still have to check whichever biological sex they are, because they are still either male or female, in addition to their gender identity or identifying as transgender."
itsafetish,ey1cxny,t3_cv08gk,1566696301.0,"As a female, the only person I ever discussed pads and tampons with was my mother when I was a teenager.  The pad, tampon, and adult diaper companies are raking in the profits and advertising from these fetishists."
GenderCritical,ey18h6g,t1_ey17cg8,1566692675.0,"Tactics from the Narcissist's handbook - gaslighting, projection and deflection, word-salad, controlling everything, minimizing others' worth, public and private shaming, third party reinforcements, perpetuating the role of victim, deliberately misrepresenting your thoughts and feelings to the point of absurdity, covert and overt threats, name-calling, pushing and ignoring boundaries, etc."
GenderCritical,ey1622c,t1_ey14kbj,1566690791.0,"They don't even see that their tactics are destroying their cause.  Harassing people, demanding respect while disrespecting everyone else, threats of violence, rape, insisting that transwomen are real women, that some women have penises, screaming constantly about how oppressed they are while terrorizing everyone who doesn't agree 100% with their delusions... the trans movement is going to implode and they really have no one to blame but themselves, mainly the rabid TRAs (Trans Rights Activists)... there are reasonable trans voices out there, Miranda Yardley, Jenn Smith, and Fionne Orlander -- maybe a few others -- but they are being attacked, too."
LGBDropTheT,ey0ydpx,t1_ey0xp5g,1566685696.0,"That's what I do at this point, use the person's name and avoid using pronouns altogether... using they/theirs if I absolutely have to use a pronoun when I'm around people who are sensitive about pronouns.  And I avoid situations and people that make me uncomfortable, especially if it feels like I'm subjecting myself to narcissistic abuse or walking on eggshells."
GenderCritical,ey0moxk,t1_ey05itz,1566680801.0,"Males and other TRA's hijacking an event where women are speaking about violence and abuse and screaming ""transwomen are women"" over and over - cussing, yelling, disrupting loudly and constantly making it about their own narcissistic agendas.  They can't go 10 seconds without interrupting.  They have no concept of respect, letting other people speak, having a conversation, possess no listening skills, and just demanding everyone agree with them.  Throwing tantrums until they get their way.  It's childish, immature, and completely narcissistic."
LGBDropTheT,exztb6v,t3_cuu2hv,1566670471.0,"I've had a few trans friends and out of respect I tried really hard to use their preferred pronouns and treat them as the ""gender"" they perceived themselves to be.  It requires a lot of mental gymnastics.  It doesn't feel right, I'm constantly questioning myself and it just feels like I'm being forced to be dishonest and lie so I don't hurt someone's feelings.  Personally, I don't care if people want to consider themselves trans, dress however they want to, live their lives in any way they want to as long as they aren't hurting anyone else, and I don't support violence towards anyone.  The biological reality is that no matter how much make-up, hormones, clothes, and surgery one has they are still either male or female - that can't be changed.  Saying that you spent thousands and thousands of dollars ""transitioning"" and therefore you are legitimate doesn't make sense to me.  All of it has become incredibly divisive within the LGB(TQ+++) community and even within just the trans community.  People want to be accepted for who they truly are but they need to spend tens of thousands of dollars altering themselves first?  What makes the most sense to me is for trans identifying people to accept the fact that they are either a Trans Identified Male or a Trans Identified Female and whatever they want to do with their presentation or gender is fine but no amount of transitioning, hormones, surgeries or money will change a person's sex from male to a female or vice versa.  I don't think there is a magical threshold where you finally aren't trans anymore... I don't think that denying reality is helpful for anyone."
truelesbians,exzokaf,t3_cut39l,1566668995.0,"I'm sorry that you're struggling so much.  I agree with some of the other commenters, therapy would be a good place to start.  I think happiness comes from living your truth, being authentic, not living in fear of what other people think of you, finding friends that value you - sometimes we have to create our own families.  Dating and relationships aren't easy, it doesn't matter if you're straight or gay... and your happiness shouldn't be dependent on a relationship or another person because anything can happen, people leave, people die, people let you down...  and some of the stress might come from big picture thinking, needing to have every detail of your life worked out.  Try to focus on one day at a time, an hour at a time, a minute at a time if you need to.  Try not to get overwhelmed with everything all at once.  I hope you get some support, help, and relief."
raisedbynarcissists,extye9n,t1_extj7a0,1566576748.0,"If you've been raised by narcissists you might have some form of PTSD and possibly anxiety and depression.  It's okay.  You can go to Google, or any search engine and type in ""therapists in my area"" there is a good therapist search that should show up from Psychology Today.  You can also go on YouTube and type in ""narcissistic abuse"", ""ptsd"", and other keywords... some of my favorite YouTube channels are: Melanie Tonia Evans, SoulGPS, Alan Robarge, Irene Lyon... if you search their names on YT they are easy to find, there are many other great channels as well.  Also, you can do searches for guided meditations, guided meditation for anxiety, guided meditation for healing your inner child, guided meditation for self confidence, guided meditation for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (anything at all, really)...  I hope some of those things are helpful,"
raisedbynarcissists,exs4i4d,t3_cu80n1,1566532068.0,"I'm so sorry that you're going through all of that... I know when things are bad it feels like it will never get better, but it will.  Try to find a counselor that specializes in narcissistic abuse, join support groups for narcissistic abuse on FB and other social media platforms, try to make some friends that are supportive and understanding.  Sending hugs and good vibes.  You aren't alone."
GenderCritical,exruwr8,t3_cu28sm,1566524743.0,"No.  I had my first trans friend about 15 years ago.  I was 24 or so at the time, so was he.  He had just gotten out of the navy and started hormones and was living with an older man he called ""daddy"" who took care of him.  He wanted me to help him shop for clothes, do his make-up, spend time with him.  He had an ""adult baby"" fetish and his room was decorated like a little girl's room.  I didn't know about the adult baby thing at first but he opened up to me about it and it freaked me out.  He eventually started asking me to change his diaper, give him baths, wanted to call me ""mommy"" and every time we were out in public he wanted to hold my hand -- it was just crossing my boundaries in every way imaginable.  I  refused to participate in any of that and encouraged him to at least act like an adult if he was going to transition.  I don't remember what the final straw was but I couldn't take it anymore and ended the friendship completely.  I've had a few other trans friends and acquaintances since then and they've all had some majorly disturbing issues."

LGBDropTheT,exrc6n1,t1_expblbh,1566514341.0,Yes.  I agree completely.
ptsd,exn11dg,t3_ctpph7,1566443763.0,"Be sure to make time to breathe and relax, connect with yourself and others, and don't be too hard on yourself.  That sounds amazing and I wish you all the best!  Sending good vibes."
LGBDropTheT,exmzrrw,t3_ctqxc3,1566443000.0,"As a lesbian, I've pretty much always been comfortable with my gay male friends.  There is no sexual attraction on either side and we both understand the struggles of being homosexual."
GenderCritical,exmvt6y,t3_ctllyk,1566440606.0,"No matter what you say or how you say it it will be construed as transphobia and will result in insults, slurs, and attacks."
truelesbians,exmrubq,t3_ctl2zr,1566438074.0,"I came out to my mom when I was 15 and she said ""you aren't gay.  you're too feminine, you're pretty, you could have any guy you want.""  And I said, ""okay, well then can I be bisexual?"" and she said, ""no that's even worse.""  I said, ""okay, well then I'm just a lesbian.""  Not feeling like I was ""butch"" enough -- not just then but many more times... it took a long time to accept and feel comfortable with myself and my sexuality without needing labels or boxes.  I'm a female and I'm a lesbian, no other boxes needed."
truelesbians,exl6g2k,t1_exl5q9j,1566406901.0,"I offer kindness and respect to everyone who isn't rude, nasty, or disrespectful.  And no matter what, I always try to remain respectful and logical when making my points."

truelesbians,exl4ig7,t3_cth9r1,1566405771.0,"Trans people have the right to exist and live their lives, free from harm.  I think every human deserves human rights.  I am not on board with the phrase ""transwomen are real women"" -- they are biological males and always will be.  I'm not on board with males in women's sports.  I'm not on board with self ID and males in women's prisons, rape shelters, locker rooms, insisting they are lesbians, and things like that.  It's a set up for complete female erasure, of all women's spaces and boundaries.  It's not coming from a place of hate for me, at all.  It's about definitions, language, boundaries, and women's rights."
truelesbians,exl344r,t1_exl2n59,1566404927.0,I'm not giving up the goal of finding a \*female\* partner.  They definitely aren't winning that battle.  I imagine there are other women on there thinking the same thing I am.
truelesbians,exl2liv,t1_exkvva3,1566404612.0,"I've seen that, too.  ""If you're a ""terf"" or you exclude transwomen then don't message me either...""  Fine by me, at least I know up front they are up to their eyeballs in TRA silliness.  Wish there was a RadFem or GC dating site for lesbians.  Or at least one that was solidly female only."
truelesbians,exkf76h,t3_ct9k43,1566387396.0,"I've been having this problem with the dating sites I'm on.  I don't think any of them are passable at all, many are absolutely frightening.  It's frustrating being on the sites and seeing tons of males identifying as lesbians, I just don't even want to bother anymore."
truelesbians,exkes88,t1_exjtbbt,1566386960.0,"It's not even a vagina, it's a penis mutilated into a crotch pocket."
itsafetish,exk7ic0,t3_ct8knf,1566377089.0,"They all spend too much time watching anime porn.  I don't think they want to be women, they want to be anime cat girls.  Nobody is turned on by this nonsense besides themselves... and maybe pervy old men and fetishists."
GenderCritical,exk2f8k,t3_ctc4u0,1566369659.0,"All of the people that have called me a ""swerf""  were men, mostly TIMs."
