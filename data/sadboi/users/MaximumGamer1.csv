Coronavirus,fqrdavx,t1_fqqu7yk,1589582117.0,"It's not even remotely comparable to those pandemics. Consider the fact that, in each of those pandemics, about 100,000 people died in the US in a span of two years in each one. The Avian flu pandemic of 1918 killed an estimated 675,000 people in the US in a span of two years. More than six times the amount of deaths.

Of course, people didn't know as much about viruses back then, but you see a lot of the same trends in that pandemic as you do with COVID-19. People not listening to health care professionals, masses of people gathering in public places despite warnings, and hell, this is all despite the fact that the pandemic hadn't been turned into a political tool. All the military brass were refusing to listen to doctors because, well, WWI was going on, and they couldn't just stop the war, as much as that sucks. That on top of the mayor of New York not taking it seriously and holding a war bonds parade that caused the pandemic to explode. Of course, on the flip side, you also have the fact that people had better access to health care, even if the healthcare wasn't as good, because the exploitive healthcare and health insurance industries that exist today did not exist back then, and you could actually go and receive healthcare for a reasonable price. That drove their deaths down, whereas the fact that there are so many people who don't have healthcare in the US today, and the fact that that number continues to climb as people get laid off and lose their employee benefits, is going to drive our deaths up, because people are going to not seek treatment out of fear of bankruptcy if they get sick. Hell, I myself am in that position.

Now, let's do some math here. The Avian/Spanish flu killed 675,000 people in 24 months. That's 15,625 deaths/mo on average. COVID really started to flare up about five months ago, and since then, 85,000 Americans have died. That's 17,000 deaths/mo, which is more than the Avian flu, and if it continues at this rate for two years, (which it won't; it will get even worse if we open the country up, so consider this a low estimate) you'd be looking at 408,000 deaths.

Now, consider the following the upper estimate. I've seen sources claim that scientists are predicting that, if we had continued or do continue to go about our lives as we did before the pandemic, we could see half the country get infected at some point before the pandemic is over. It's widely accepted that COVID has a mortality rate of 1%. Now, that may not sound like much, but that is 10 times worse than the flu. The US has a population of roughly 330 million people. If half of those people got infected, and 1% of those people died, we'd be looking at roughly 1,650,000 deaths, which is more than twice as deadly than the Avian flu.

Now, don't consider these scientific estimates per se. I'm just using the numbers that we have so far to do a little bit of math, and I'm no epidemiologist so I'm oversimplifying things a lot, and obviously a vaccine could potentially be made before it gets this bad. But damn, that's scary, and if I were a foreign leader, I wouldn't want my borders with the US open right now with states like Wisconsin defying stay-at-home orders, crazy people thinking that wearing masks for their protection is somehow a violation of their rights, and a President cheering them on."

Hell, when the vaccine comes out for it, they'll probably refuse to get it. And these are the people in power. Shit is going to get really bad here, really fast. Probably the worst pandemic in the history of this country. Including smallpox, including the Avian flu of 1918."

politics,fpt5tb6,t1_fps1zkj,1588885364.0,"The huge mistake you're making is assuming that independent voters are centrists when they're just not. That's oversimplifying a very diverse voter base. People are independent voters for many reasons, but the most common reason is that they're disillusioned with the party they'd otherwise be in. Those aren't swing voters. Those are non-voters who don't feel the same kind of party loyalty that you do, who are often Gen X or millennial voters, who have to be motivated to come out to vote or they won't vote at all or vote third party. In fact, the truth may even be the opposite of what you just said. You could get someone who is so far to the left that they motivate the Independent base to show up, but turn off the Democrats. That seems to be what we have with Bernie Sanders, for example. At the country level, anyway.

My interpretation is that Colorado is the most left-leaning state in the whole country other than Vermont itself. Think about it. We were the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use. In both the 2016 and 2020 primaries, the state chose Bernie Sanders. We currently have a gay governor who may not be entirely a progressive in the sense that he's not an exact match of the Sanders platform, but he's pretty close. The closest of any gov. in the country.

I personally loathe the idea of nominating someone just because they held office before. That's how you get an entire Senate floor of aging career politicians who engage in blatant corporate corruption to enrich themselves once they realize that they could do anything and not suffer consequences on election day because they have a D or an R in front of their name. Considering Hickenlooper is already so loyal to the oil and gas industry that he was literally willing to drink a cup of fracking fluid to show his subservience, yes, that's a thing he actually did, we already know Hick has a tendency for this kind of corruption. In this instance, he has name recognition because he is notoriously unpopular in Colorado, which is name recognition you don't want. He ended his time as governor with a very low net favorability rating. That's not someone you want to run in the future.

At the end of the day, you could nominate a chimpanzee playing the tambourine and it will get the Dem base as long as it has a D in front of its name and isn't hated by the party constituency. No Dem is going to vote for Gardner under any circumstances. But why risk keeping the base at home on election day and lose the Independent vote when you could run literally anybody against Gardner and they'll win since Gardner is hated in his own party? There's no reason to take that risk when you could nominate someone like Romanoff who motivates independents, keeps the left from voting third party, trounces Gardner with ease, and will push all those fantastic things on the progressive agenda in office to boot. Your other choice is Hickenlooper, who definitely strikes me as the kind of Steve Mnuchin/Dianne Feinstein Dem who will vote with Trump 50% of the time, and will especially give him everything he wants regarding the oil and gas industry, which is a dangerous platform to have considering the 2030 UN deadline to remove fossil fuels from our economy entirely, and deeply problematic when running in the state with possibly the densest population of environmentalists in the country.

Certainly, this is what the Colorado caucus results are showing. In a crowded primary ticket, including Hickenlooper with all his name recognition/infamy, Romanoff consistently manages to get not just a plurality, but a majority, of votes. If the media were treating the Colorado senate race with any kind of accuracy, they'd be treating it like its an inevitability that he's going to win the primary and wouldn't waste time with matchups using the losing primary candidate against the Republican, but since Romanoff is a progressive, the so-called left-wing media is going to do a blackout of his campaign and push his centrist opponent against all odds. It's the same thing they tried to do to Sanders, AOC, the entire rest of the Squad, and all the rest of the progressives who have ever run for federal office. It works most of the time, but this is one of those instances where it's not working.

At the end of the day, Hickenlooper's reputation precedes him, making him possibly the only Dem candidate who could lose to Gardner. You have the option of voting for someone who would be fantastic not just for Colorado, but the US as a whole, against a deeply unpopular Republican who he'd utterly crush instead. If the center's sole objective in this race is to unseat Gardner at any cost, the choice should be obvious."

Nice try, but Coloradoans are having none of it. Romanoff continues to lead the race with a majority in precinct caucuses in a large field of candidates despite you doing this for months.

Coloradoans hate Hickenlooper. He drank the goddamn fracking fluid and let the industry basically do whatever the hell it wanted while he was governor, including operate in residential areas and protected lands, and we haven't forgotten. And this is the guy the centrist media is stanning? Do you WANT Gardner to keep his seat? Hickenlooper is the most likely Democrat in the race to lose to Gardner, you have another candidate who will absolutely destroy Gardner by actually representing Coloradoans and their desire for progressive policy reform, and I'm told by everyone in the center that their top, and often only, priority is toppling the Republicans from power, but the centrist wing of the party seems to absolutely love picking the weakest candidate. But of course the exact same thing is happening at the Presidential level, so why am I surprised? It's almost like you care more about keeping the left out of power than you do about unseating Republicans or something. Nobody is quite as good at losing as the Democratic Party.

And of course the worst news of all regarding this is that neither of the two major candidates for President of the US in 2020 has a plan to tackle this.

Seriously though, the Flood are obviously horrifying enough in the Halo games themselves, but if you've ever read the novelizations of them and the Forerunner trilogy... Let's just say that getting infected by the Flood is a fate worse than death, and of course, they're so virulent that it's a fate that you can't avoid, even if you're a hyper-advanced, planet-creating, damn near all-powerful civilization like the Forerunners, who had to resort to superweapons that wipe out all life in the galaxy so the Flood would starve and life could be re-seeded later, resulting in their own extinction. Even they couldn't stop the Flood by conventional means. So what chance would WE have if they landed on Earth? You think COVID is bad? The Flood would have the human race extinct in a matter of hours. And we'd all either be trapped in our own bodies experiencing indescribable pain as our bodies are mutated to have more tentacles and protruding sharp bits, and all the while we're forced to kill our loved ones by the thing that just invaded our chest cavity and hijacked our nervous system like Jenkins, ultimately destined to either grow new infection forms in our bodies and explode in the face of the nearest sentient, or slowly tortured to death as a Gravemind sucks out all of our most treasured memories while we futilely resist giving it the information it needs to find more people to om nom nom, where the only real hope of stopping it is for a super soldier to fight their way through waves of Flood so they can cave your skull in before the Flood gets the info, like Keyes. None of it sounds particularly pleasant.

And hell, I haven't even gotten into the Logic Plague yet. Imagine, if you will, a literal mountain of infected people all cobbled together that is nearly omnipotent from all the intelligence it's assimilated into its being. That is the Flood Gravemind, the hivemind of their species. It is so witty from all the brain matter is has from all those people its body is made out of that it can verbally redpill anything sentient to do whatever it wants. A Skyrim character with a Speech skill of 100000, if you will. This can range from shaking a being's faith in its religion that just five seconds ago it wholeheartedly believed in, like the Arbiter, to killing oneself like the first humans who discovered the Primordial, or even to defecting to the Flood. And it can even do this to hyper-intelligent AI created by the Forerunners. In other words, not having an organic form to infect does NOT make you safe, and the Flood don't even need to infect you to make you work for them at that point. They just do it because you taste so good.

The scariest part about it though is that a life form like the Flood would be a very successful species. It's essentially what every parasite wants to be. Therefore, it's not only possible, but likely that a life form like that could develop somewhere in the universe and find a way to spread beyond its planet the moment it's discovered by a space-faring civilization. It might not have as many science-fantasy abilities as the Flood from Halo do, but a parasite that utilizes its host's body and intelligence to exponentially increase its ability to infect even more people would perform very well in real life, and it would be a fate worse than death. Jenkins was driven to become suicidal in minutes due to the sheer agony of being a Combat Form, and understandably so, but once you're infected, your release is only going to come in one of two ways: Getting killed while trying to infect someone, or becoming a Carrier Form and having a dozen or so more infection forms grow and wriggle around in your body before you finally let them out by exploding. It's the last thing our little planet Earth would want to be discovered by."

halospv3,fp1t8sd,t3_g371pi,1588247116.0,"Honestly, I've not found the enemies to be THAT hard. It certainly isn't nearly as hard as some of the other Halo games on Legendary, or at least when I play on Heroic. You really just have to use the sandbox to your advantage. You can pump all the bullets you want into an Honor Guard elite, but it's not going to go down unless you noob combo him. Always remember that a solution to every enemy with tons of shields is to just use the noob combo. Often when you shoot a sword elite with the plasma pistol's charged shot, it will even stop charging at you to scream at you for a bit, which is free headshot mode.

Honestly, where I take issue is with the two new levels. Making wide open sections pitch black is a god awful idea. I get it. You're trying to be atmospheric. It's fucking stupid. At least have there be enough light to see by in areas where the range of the flashlight is disgustingly short. Trying to find the rocket launcher flood that killed you for the umpteenth time in the pitch black of the valley is stupid, stupid, stupid. Oh, and don't think I didn't notice how you spammed them everywhere. Kind of hard not to. The original game used rocket flood sparingly, and for good reason. Throwing them everywhere and making it so you can't see them but they can see you is incredibly bad level design. None Left Behind just felt like it was trying to annoy the player most of the time. You did this a lot on The Maw as well, which I hated almost as much since the flashlight wouldn't light up the walls and floor of the level for whatever reason, making it damn near impossible to see. Realistic lighting is all well and good in survival horror games, but Halo is not a survival horror game. It's a first-person shooter, and should be treated as such. That means always enough lighting to at least be able to see by, even if it's maybe not realistic.

Oh, and also. Overall, stop it with the infection forms. Can we just stop that? Why does every other flood have to spawn infection forms on death? It gets incredibly annoying and slows the game down way too much to have to spend several minutes meleeing infection forms every time you finish a firefight. This is extremely bad on Keyes.

- Can't sleep because my sleep schedule is royally fucked, and every time I manage to fix it, it's fucked again within a few weeks.

- Nobody will hire me despite me being overqualified for most jobs I apply for these days. It's so bad that I've never been able to move out of my parents' house due to lack of money, despite wanting to so badly since we differ so much ideologically at this point that I can't stand living here anymore.

- I live in an existence of indescribable loneliness. I get to hang out with a friend in person once a month, if that. I've never really had a significant other and have only known rejection. It's been this way for me for over 12 years, and at this point, my social skills have deteriorated to the point where there is very little hope for me. I'm just far too awkward to make new friends, and nobody I ever like is going to give a chance to the below-average looking guy who can't keep it together. I can't put into words how painful it is to be physically and mentally incapable of satisfying my basic need for friendly human contact.

- Chronic depression that never goes away. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy or excited about anything. Nothing is fulfilling anymore, and I mostly just continue my hobbies as a distraction from everything, not necessarily because I actually get any real gratification from it anymore.

- Struggling to find a reason to exist. It's already as if I don't exist to the world, and despite desperately trying to change it for years, it's always one step forward and two steps back.

- My only couple-month long respite from this living hell was a friend I made a few years ago who was pushed away from me by her abusive boyfriend cause he was jealous that he didn't have her all to himself at all times. After everything I had been through up to that point, finally making a real friend and being able to hang out with someone who listened and cared and got to enjoy hobbies with and share secrets... It was like having a taste of normal life. Things were looking up then. But then things ended as badly as possible, I will never see my friend again, and even now, several years and a restraining order on the abusive boyfriend later, not a day goes by that I don't miss the shit out of her and hate his rotten guts for everything he did to the both of us. In other words, I can't move on.

- The candidate that was my only hope to actually being able to get any of these mental health issues addressed any time this decade has dropped out, and along with him any hope for actually solving the climate crisis. So yeah, I get to try to deal with all of this shit knowing that, no matter who we elect, the planet is doomed to die in the next 15-20 years. So even if I am somehow able to discover a solution to all of this shit, the hell is it going to matter when society collapses due to the hundreds of trillions in damage from rising sea levels alone and we start eating each other? Nothing matters anymore. Nothing. Hopes and dreams matter exceedingly little when you know the consequences of current events are a death spiral for the entire human race, and you feel like the last sane person on Earth.

- Oh, and to top it all off, our last decade or two as a species will now be spent in pandemic and recession. My only solace is that now I don't have to feel so bad about being so socially isolated, because now everyone has to do it. For once, my life is normal, but for all the wrong reasons.

I want to just fade out of existence or wake up and find out I've been in a coma for the past 12 years, living in a horrifically cruel nightmare."

In short, the reason why Biden is winning is because he has name recognition, and the voting block that only consumes cable TV, which is always favorable coverage for the establishment and a blackout of the left, views it as a civic duty to vote, while it seems to be significantly harder to motivate Sanders' young base to vote. In the end, it doesn't matter how much money Bernie spends or how hard he campaigns as long as the older generations who actually vote continue to have an unfavorable view of him.

That's what the scientists are telling us. If that doesn't scare you shitless, it should. We've known this since the 2015 UN Climate Summit. Maybe if we had elected Bernie last time, we'd be well on our way already and not having to do a rush job.

Nobody said that this was going to be easy, but the alternative is the death of the human race in my lifetime. Yes, 2030 is only ten years from now. That fact should open your eyes to the urgency of the climate crisis, and why we cannot afford to nominate Joe Biden. The deadline to start revolutionizing our entire energy system is January 20, 2021 and no later. If another President is elected this year who does not take this seriously like Trump or Biden, then we won't get any more chances."
PoliticalDiscussion,fkruxfc,t1_fkruksi,1584476535.0,I have read his climate plan. He says his plan is to cut fossil fuels in half by 2030 when scientists are saying they need to be gone COMPLETELY by that date. Actually read the links you send me before you spew it next time.

PoliticalDiscussion,fkq9gyk,t1_fkpvazd,1584436389.0,"> Climate change is still seen by most people as more of a vague future-extant threat than as a we-are-all-going-to-die-right-now thing. Should it be?

Yes. The UN Climate Summit told us that the date that we need to be completely off of fossil fuels before the world hits the point of no return is 2030. That's ten years from now. If you're under the age of 70, that's statistically in your lifetime.

> I mean one of the other big threads on this very subreddit is about how climate change is sort of a bougie-ass rich people problem to worry about, because the working class doesn't functionally have any way to meaningfully effect it.

Both of those things aren't true. Climate change is everyone's issue, and if anyone benefits from us not doing anything about it, at least in the short term, it's bougie fossil fuel execs. And the working class does have power to do something meaningful. It's not much, but it's something. We can vote. And not for Joe Biden. Hell, voting for Bernie Sanders would do a hell of a lot more to help all of us who can barely make ends meet other than just saving the planet. But seeing as climate change is the thing that has a 100% chance to kill us if we do nothing about it, that's what I personally have been making the biggest deal out of. Hell, I'm uninsured and it's still my #1 issue, because I don't want to live to see the human race die. The people who will have to suffer the worst effects of it are going to be the working people. The bougies will all be hiding in their bunkers, counting their now-worthless blood money and compete to see who got the highest score before the Earth went Game Over."
PoliticalDiscussion,fkq65m2,t1_fkq5s3j,1584432166.0,"Yeah, and Joe Biden sends you thanks so he can kill the planet to satisfy his ego. Did you not read a thing I said? Now, if he wants to change his climate policy, he can have at it. But I doubt he will, because he's in debt to the fossil fuel industry. But if he does, you let me know.

But if he inevitably doesn't, and you want to know who is going to be responsible for electing Trump in November, look in the mirror. You had your shot to elect someone who could have beaten him and saved the human race. Two of them. And you blew it. All because ""Oh, a 'Bernie Bro' was mean to me online,"" or ""No, I don't care about the 26,000 Americans who die each year because of a lack of health insurance,"" or ""No, I don't care about saving the planet because I may or may not be alive to deal with the consequences of my inaction. The SCOTUS seat was more important than humanity's future.""

I have no faith in the human race anymore. How is it this hard to get people to see past petty shit and look at the big picture? God, maybe it's a good thing we're all going to die before we can spread to the stars. The universe doesn't need our infection. Just think about what we'd do if we remained the way we are now and we did. We'd be just like the aliens in Independence Day, destroying planets and consuming the resources like locusts, all because humans are too self absorbed to see the consequences of their actions. Look at us. We're so hopeless that we're ruining our own planet, and meanwhile, the only thing that seems to matter to half the people in the richest, most powerful country in the history of the world is seats in the Supreme Court and whether or not the guy in charge has a D in front of his name on TV, and the other half are the exact same, but they want people with R's in front of their names.

Actually, I should give us a bit more credit. Only 22% of the population are Democrats, and an equal amount of people are Republicans. Maybe you should have remembered that when you elected someone who will get 0% of the independent vote. Buy hey, at least the illusion that Trump is a populist has been burst for all the factory workers in the Rust Belt, right? Or at least, that's what you better be hoping. Your only hope is that they sit out, just like me, because there is no way they're voting for Biden.

I live in Colorado. It's going to vote blue, okay? My vote doesn't matter. Your camp spent the whole primary proving that. Your camp spent this whole primary displaying openly how little it cares about the working people, the younger generations, or democracy. You've spent this whole entire time burning bridges and spitting in our faces when all we wanted was a future. And now you come here after all that demanding my vote and holding me responsible for the fact that you didn't realize until it was too late that Joe Biden wasn't electable? Give me a break. You know what we call this outside of politics? An abusive relationship. And that's why I'll never be a registered Democrat again. As much as that matters, seeing as we've got 10-20 years before every coastal city and low lying area in the world is underwater, every arid area in the world is uninhabitable, severe weather events become worse than ever before, the droughts begin to kill our global food economy, and human civilization collapses. Nobody is going to care who was President in 2020 when they're dead or sitting around a campfire. Or if they do, they'll be cursing your name for not nominating the only candidate who would have solved the climate crisis. They'll curse the entire Boomer generation for allowing this to come even remotely close to happening when you/they've known what they needed to do for fifty years. But mostly, they'll just be thinking about trying to survive another day in the hellscape you created for us.

That hellscape is going to be a reality for me and my kids, if I choose to have them, no matter who wins the general election if Joe Biden wins the nomination. Vote blue no matter who? The planet is DEAD NO MATTER WHO!!! So you can go to the polls in November and feel real good about yourself for voting against the big, bad Trump, knowing what you've done, that we have no future anyway because of who you nominated. Meanwhile, I'll be evaluating whether or not there's a point in going on living on a planet that's doomed to die in my lifetime. Nothing could make a voter more apathetic than knowing that, no matter what they do, there's nothing they can do to stop the coming fire, all because people cared about short term profits and petty, tribal politics more than they did about the future of the human race. Suddenly there's no point in voting, or doing much of anything, really. At least, if I'm still alive when the time comes, and some kid asks me what happened in 2020 to cause the world to become like this, I can say I did everything with what feeble power I had to prevent this from happening. But my feeble power wasn't good enough, because there were too many people like you in the world who didn't care about that kid from the future."
PoliticalDiscussion,fkpilhq,t3_fjdjy1,1584411011.0,"The simple fact is that if we do not elect someone willing to commit to the Green New Deal NOW, it will already be too late in 2024. The deadline to be completely off of fossil fuels is 2030, and the deadline to start while still being able to maintain our current standard of living is January 20, 2021. We would have to elect someone impossibly radical on the issue of climate change who would force us to change our entire way of life for six years, or when that obviously doesn't happen, overthrow the system entirely in order to save the planet. Otherwise, it wouldn't matter. The global climate will already have become be a ticking time bomb that we can't disarm from the moment we nominated Joe Biden."

We've already hit that point with climate change, and STILL Democratic voters are nominating the guy who doesn't believe in climate science. The problem is that we just can't seem to get Americans to think further than four years ahead, and by 2026, it will already be six years too late to do anything."
PoliticalDiscussion,fkpdyop,t3_fj7w7p,1584407841.0,"It's only going to happen is Bernie is the nominee. Joe Biden has alienated virtually everyone outside the Boomer generation. As someone who is 25, I'm certainly not going to vote for a candidate with an inadequate climate change policy like Biden's. I am forced to vote Green and hope a miracle happens for the sake of my own future in that situation.

Bottom line is this. The UN Climate Summit told us that if we did not remove fossil fuels from the world economy by 2030, the consequences for the planet would be irreversible and catastrophic, and likely result in hundreds of trillions of dollars in damage, which would collapse the world economy and end human civilization as we know it. The deadline to start the process of revolutionizing our energy system is January 20, 2021, and no later.

Joe Biden's climate plan is to cut emissions in HALF by 2030. In other words, he's literally on the middle ground between believing in science and not believing in science. But the middle ground between sanity and sheer insanity is still insanity, and climate change is an all or nothing issue.

So no, I will not vote for Joe Biden in the general election, and I don't think anyone remotely educated in my generation will either. You can shame us, tell us we're allowing fascism to rise, and all of that bullshit, but you need to get it through your thick skull that none of that is going to matter if human civilization is put on a path to destruction no matter which candidate we nominate. My grandchildren, if I even have kids after this, aren't going to care who won the 2020 Presidential Election when the planet is a hellscape and people are living in tribes to survive.

So, if you voted for Joe Biden and he goes on to lose, it's not going to be our fault that you nominated someone who cares about his fossil fuel industry donors more than he cares about what happens to the human race any further than 10 years down the line. You made everyone under the age of 50 who believes in science an apathetic voter because you created a situation where the planet dies no matter who we vote for in the general election, effectively dooming us all. You nominated the bastard when you could have nominated someone who actually believes in science and would have destroyed Trump without question. That is ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT, and if you go and blame young progressives when you inevitably lose again to Trump, that is exactly what we are going to tell you. You saw this coming. 2016 should have been a lesson for you. And yet you decided to repeat all the same mistakes."
