I didn't know exactly what I was afraid but it was really unsettling. I was afraid to open the bible, I don't know why.

The other comments on this post recommended I seek out other Christians but I've been feeling so lowly, afraid to show my face in a church. You are right that since I've been returning to faith that satan has been going after me. I think you are also right that I need to find support in a Christian community. I've been reading my bible and praying, and that has helped a lot. I think I need people who are of faith to guide me properly though.

I read the passages that you recommended and they have brought me some peace. I mean this honestly, your comment today is really what I needed to hear. I have decided in final to go to church on this coming sunday. Thank you again."

I was using a Samson Meteor Mic (condenser, USB) before and it wasn't really that great. Picked up a lot of background hissing. From what I've read about dynamic mics, they're good for home studios where you don't have any acoustic treatment or if you have background noise like a computer humming. And just the quality overall is much better than the USB mic I was using. It's like night and day listening to myself singing into each of the mics. I just record in my bedroom the upgrade was well worth it.

schizoaffective,fc2dche,t3_efnihi,1577353562.0,"Hey, I just read your post. I think it's really good that you're engaging in school and that it doesn't stress you too much. Book smarts are good to have. I think it's still worth being proud of that you tried out a job, even if it didn't work out in the end. Disability income might be the bridge you need to get closer to where you'd like to be.

I wish I could offer you something to make the depression better, but I struggle with that too and nothing has permanently made it go away. The only thing I've learned, and I'm not saying this is how it works for everybody, is that depression tends to come in waves. If you can weather the storm there is usually something somewhat brighter on the other end. Do you have any hobbies? If you do I recommend sticking with them, even if it feels like you're just going through the motions. If anything, it will at least keep your skills topped up for days that you might be feeling a little better.

I relate to the self-hatred and anger of being in this fight. It is draining and feels endless.

All that said, giving positive vibes is easy, I know the real work is in your hands. I might not understand exactly what you're going through, but I do know that it is very hard to live a life you want while having this illness. I don't like to lie to people and say that I know everything will be fine, that's just not something to be known. In the same reasoning, however, I don't think that it's impossible to go after things you wish to have in your life. Perhaps it's worth pushing on and continuing your fight, if only to see how far you can go. A persons limits are only found when they are tested. You have book smarts, a good grounding for being cautious as you see what you are capable of. I'm not saying to throw yourself unknowingly at life, just that you may find you have more potential to have a better life than you feel you have.

If it means anything, I care that you are struggling with this. I do hope you find your path to feeling more whole and less in a shadow."

I really like that fluttery thing you do on some of your higher notes, how do you do that? I won't steal your style I promise, I just want to try that because it sounds sweet. 

Do you make the music 100% by yourself or do you have a band?

You have a lot of passion in your music. It feels like you go full out on every song I've listened to, it's really emotional in a way that makes me feel connected to your music. I'm trying to work on some new music right now but I've been kind of stuck on finding my muse. Your music is opening new brain pathways or something because I feel inspired by it. After I listened to your songs earlier I started trying to come up with melodies and I was coming up with some cool ones after being stuck in a rut for a while. I wish I had been recording them, I was just in the moment though so I didn't want to ruin it getting my computer/DAW setup to record.

It's so cool to have music from somebody who goes through similar things that I do. I hope you keep at it man!"

I bought a computer just over a year ago and I use it only for music (\~600$). It's taken me until now to pay it off but it was so worth it. If you're computer savvy I'm sure you could build one for a lot cheaper than that though. Bought a cheaper mic (comparatively, 100$ is not cheap while living on income assistance!). I'm actually hoping I can afford to buy a music program for my computer pretty soon too. You can get some decent music software for free if you can't afford a DAW right away.

There are a few subreddits where you can collaborate your music with other people (/r\_bedroombands, r/\_musicinthemaking). I just collaborated with somebody the other day and they made a really cool instrumental that they added my vocals onto. I'm not overly interested in producing instrumental music, so I'm grateful that I can work with somebody to make a full song. For the most part, I just download loops that other people make and sing over top of them ([looperman.com](https://looperman.com))."
singing,fa6roz5,t3_e7sbfs,1575827846.0,"I bought a condenser mic for around 100$ (Samson meteor mic). It does the job but it definitely picks up a lot of background fuzz. It takes a little more work to make it sound clear. The actual sound of singing does sound pretty nice though. It does get overloaded fast if I go too loud, distortion can be a problem if I don't get the distance from the mic just right. For the price I'm pretty happy with it though. If you're more in the hobby/practice realm I think that you'll do just fine with that budget.

Here's an example of something I recorded with it. You'll probably hear the background fuzz in the vocal parts, as I did nothing to remove it other than a little EQ. [https://soundcloud.com/user-414706677/brokenman](https://soundcloud.com/user-414706677/brokenman)"

When I get a strange belief or thought that I cannot verify, I make a conscious choice not to make any major life decisions or changes based on what I am thinking about. It doesn't always work as sometimes the paranoia of other people is so strong that I can't help but do something stupid/drastic. But on the average day where I'm getting 20 strange thoughts an hour, it keeps me level.

I will try to think through what the consequences would be if I acted on a strange idea that could potentially be false. I should add that if I wasn't on consistent medication then I probably wouldn't be able to think rationally enough to do this. And some days I still make bad decisions. It's just a useful tool in my coping toolbox.

I think one of the turning points in my illness was when I decided that I was going to just live a normal boring life, even though I thought there was some crazy mystical existential shit going on.

""I think I'm an enlightened genius who knows the inner workings of the universe. I should look up mystical shit all the time, read about spiritual entities, try to tap into my third eye.

I've purchased a camping trailer to convert into a tiny house and live out in the woods by myself. (These are all real decisions I made).""

""I 'MIGHT' be a mystical powerful alien being, sure, who knows. So far I haven't been able to create matter with my mind or grow money on my finger tips though.

Instead of reading about how we are all one unified being, I will maybe try to do a load of laundry instead and have a shower if I feel up to it.""

I feel like everyone is free to have their own beliefs as well, if you've got things that work for you than that's great! I have my own beliefs that are actually kind of strange sometimes, but they help me get through when nothing else does. I'm not a practicing christian, but sometimes holding a bible close helps when I get delusions about demons or spirits.

Not quite the same thing for my business but similar. It would be more like customers call me up, I go to their location and grab all their junk they don't want, load it in the truck and then take it to the dump or recycler or sell it. I estimate I'll need around 15,000$ for the truck, trailer, and startup costs (biz licence, insurance, etc). 

It will definitely be more expensive if I start hiring employees and expanding, but every truck on the road that has steady work is going to bring in ~120,000$ a year (minus expenses) from my research/estimates. ~30,000 each for the 2 employees to run the truck. I don't remember the running costs but I think after everything the actual profit would be around 25,000$ for the year. All estimates of course. As long as the work keeps building there will be profit. I watched an interview with a junk business entrepreneur last week actually. He's on his 8th year now, his company is in 6 cities, 54 employees. Profit for the year was 4 million, took home 18% of that himself (720,000$). I know it's not going to be black and white and work exactly like that, but it gives me hope and shows me it can be done."
schizoaffective,f75h1dl,t1_f75cuwp,1573415011.0,"Thank you, I won't lie I'm more often feeling depressed than I am ambitious. But I always get up after I've fallen. I think it's a skill, not something I was born with. I used to be very timid, never had any ambition beyond getting stoned or drunk. Never thought I'd work beyond a minimum wage job. The illness was a blessing and a curse in that sense. I had a very traumatic psychosis experience where I thought I was going to die, and it wasn't just death that scared me the most, it was realizing I hadn't done anything with my life. If you looked at me five years ago you would see a very different person. Even 2 years. I am always working on myself, even with the millions of setbacks I am always facing. My point is, you can build parts of yourself you never thought you would have!

Man I hear you with the spending problem. When I get my disability check it's gone in the first week and I'm broke the rest of the month. It's something I just haven't addressed yet. I don't think it's permanent though, I think both of us could overcome it if we really set our mind to it.

Radiology is a great goal to have, and the money isn't bad either! I hope I didn't make it seem like I was trying to steer you away from that, just wanted to offer an idea! If you ever feel like chatting about goals and stuff like that, send me a pm, I love talking about that kind of stuff."
schizoaffective,f75a9tc,t3_dueib8,1573413242.0,"Yes, definitely. I've been on disability for about 8 years I think. I've worked myself up to the point where I felt I could go back to work quite a few times. Then something has always happened to trigger my psychosis and sent me backward. I haven't given up hope though and my goal is always going to be independence.

At the moment I'm trying to get up the nerve to apply for a job just doing cart retrieval at Walmart. It's not a glamorous job, but I've accepted that I will have to start from the bottom. I think in longer-term goals now (2, 5, 10 years down the road). The current plan is to get a part-time job and save all the extra money I earn. If I don't spend any more than I already get from disability, I estimate that within 1.5-2 years I can save enough money for a full-size truck and trailer. Once I have acquired that, I will be starting a junk removal business with my cousin who has the same diagnosis. I hope to hire employees within 2 years of starting, expand to other cities within 3. 10 years in, the goal is to be off the trucks myself and just running the company. Buy a house, have the lifestyle I want at that point. It might sound like a pipe dream and of course, it won't happen exactly like that. But having something to move towards creates momentum. I started planning this business 2 years ago, it's a slow process but I am always working towards it. It might sound hard to think you won't have what you want for 10 whole years. But that time will pass either way, so why not work towards something? And it can be kind of freeing and seem more manageable with a larger time frame. What if you thought ""I have   
a whole 10, 15, 20 years to reach my goal. Could I build the life I want with 15 years to work on it?""

Relapse and psychosis are always a fear I have, but at this point, I feel the risk is worth it. I know that I am not happy in my current lifestyle, especially being reliant on the government for money. I won't lie, I am scared as hell. I want to sit in my room and smoke weed all day so that I don't have to face the world. But I know that I will regret it if I keep going in that direction. I fall down constantly and I've given up on my goals several times. If you looked at my post history you would see that I often question my abilities and feel like giving up. I guess I have some fire left in me though because I always end up fighting my way forward again.

Perhaps having longer-term goals would set you on a more clear trajectory. Have you ever considered starting a small business? It sounds daunting, but it's probably not as crazy as you think. You don't have to have high ambition for it as I do, just something to support a good lifestyle would be enough. Work a shitty job for a few years, save all your money for startup capital. Service industries are good for having a low barrier to entry. The competition is higher because of that, but you can always do things to make yourself stand out, and honestly just being kind and reliable is the easiest way to do that. Contingency plans can always be created for what happens if you have a breakdown. Save every dollar you can, in case you need to support yourself while you take a break and recover. 

Just an idea I thought I would share for you to consider. You might be able to do more than you think. Good luck!"

I don't see it as a list society came up with for me to follow, I see it as actual pragmatic things to strive for.

&#x200B;

I agree that I need to look at myself compared to yesterday rather than compared to other people, and I know I'm better in some ways so that's good. It's also hard looking back at the good things about myself I've lost over time. I am pretty hard on myself sometimes and I know it drags me down sometimes. I just feel like I could be more than I am.

Do you think it would be a good idea to tell them I have a mental illness? I don't know how else I would explain the huge gap in my work history. They mention accommodations for people with disabilities so I would hope they don't discriminate.

Thank you so much for your reply. It came at just the right time with the job being posted on the walmart website. This might be the right opportunity at the right time for me. I hope I can get an interview and handle it well. Earning some of my own money, even if it's just part-time, would really change how I feel about myself. I'm trying not to let myself get too excited in case I don't get the job. But it's an opportunity I hadn't thought of and I'm going to see if it will work."

MusicInTheMaking,f32a8qp,t3_df7qd9,1570599315.0,"Hey man I don't think my voice would suit this but I wanted to say your own voice sounds pretty good! Goes well with the vibes you have going on. With a little practice, you'd be hitting notes better and would sound amazing. You come up with good melodies that match your voice. The autotune goes well with your voice too. 

If you just don't like singing than I get it. But if you're worried about how you sound, it will just take some time to hone in your singing skills. You're already nice to listen to so don't be afraid of your own voice!"

I had a blog for a while where I was documenting my struggles but I didn't really get much interest from people. It was hard to talk about things I experience in an interesting way. I think partly because I face the same general problems continuously. I don't think people are too interested in me complaining about the same things over and over again. It ended up turning mostly into poetry near the end.

I'd be open to talking through DM's, although I can't promise I'd have many interesting things to say lol"

WeAreTheMusicMakers,etlf714,t1_etle2zk,1562934550.0,"Thank you for the advice, I really appreciate it! I'm probably going to look for a producer to collab with to help make the instrumentals better, I'm focusing on singing only at the moment. I will take your advice about adding some harmonies!

The main thing I was looking for with posting this was just to see if people think my voice suits the trap sounding type of music. I usually make folk or rock music because my voice fits it a lot easier, but the music I'd really like to make is closer to the vibes of xxxtentacion. I just wasn't sure if my voice sounds like what I'd like to go for. This track was mostly just a sketch to see what I sound like, definitely not a full piece, or even something I was sure I wanted to make a complete track."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,etla5i5,t1_etl9lph,1562929126.0,"This is really cool, I love the soundscape you have going on. I think the beat is really good, could be slightly louder but only a little bit, mostly the kick. I think the voice sounds really good with the music, though maybe cutting it out and bringing it back in would make it more of a tease, just a thought. The bassy sounding synth reminds of the ""Stranger Things"" music, which I love. This is the type of song I could listen to on repeat on a long car ride."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,etl9jbv,t1_etl84di,1562928355.0,"Absolutely love the visual on this one. I listened to blue moon and it was super trippy. I like the spacey sounds you have going on, and when the wind part came in it gave me chills. Saving this one to come back to again"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,etl9957,t1_etl8hwf,1562927983.0,"Nice vibes. I feel like you sing lower than where your sweet spot for singing is. It doesn't sound bad but I feel like you could get more energy by expanding into higher notes a little more. You'll find with more practice that you'll get a little more power in your voice. I can feel the emotional backing is there for sure, maybe some more confidence in your voice would bring that out more? Keep on going man you got this!"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,etl92jq,t1_etl8h1y,1562927743.0,"Good flow man, got in the groove really well. Your accent sounds good with your style too. Enjoyed this one."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,etl8gih,t3_cc9088,1562926919.0,"I'm experimenting with where I want to go style-wise with my singing. I mixed trap sounding instrumentals with myself singing. I'm just wondering what people think of my voice matched to this kind of music, does it sound like it fits? I'm probably going to keep trying this style either way but I'm curious what other people think of it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should probably add that I'm just a singer not a producer, so the instrumentals are from looperman
