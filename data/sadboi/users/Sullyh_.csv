If you want to do  like vuzix smartglasses, only option i found was buying the just the glasses (which are kinda weird looking) of predator smartglasses. I tried to find any information on whether it has reflective or diffractive waveguide, but I could not find it. If you do not know what waveguide is do some research on it. I asked many companies if I somehow can buy or get the glasses, but they rejected. Even though you can get a  display projector from TI for $99, when you do not have any of these glasses, you can't make it, unfortunately. So, what I am doing the second option, which is using transparent OLED. You have to get anti-reflective and kind of dark tinted glasses, so your oled is hid behind it. If you say it is ok if i have a long weird looking stick and I can look through it, then you can just get a pair of mirrors and put them in crossing way, or you can get that from amazon for $25."
