I did this by accident when I got into a long term relationship and decided, yeah me and my partner have the strongest connection, I don't need to bother with any superficial interactions. It was only after this relationship ended that i realised I had to start making an effort with other people. Yeah, most conversations are superficial asf and painful with extroverts but I've realised you need to go through that small talk to cut through the layer of crap and get to know the person at the end of it.

I wish you luck, but make sure you're emotionally strong for this - it's made me feel very uncomfortable in my own skin and like I'm a strange person lol, though I didn't make a conscious choice to do this, so perhaps it will be different for you."
infj,fbtv59y,t3_eeixl7,1577097558.0,"I have to admit, I'm much more able to open up and act ""extroverted"" when drunk due to my inibitions going. 

I'm sorry you're going through this, I would say however that most people feel that alcohol makes them more confident and able to come out of their shell, so it probably has more to do with your genetics (whether addiction is hereditary I'm not 100% sure) than being an infj.

Edit: but it probably doesn't help that you are both infj and struggling with addiction as infjs are quite complex."

infj,faelbi0,t3_e8ti3v,1576003044.0,"Same here, I feel like a bit of an outcast being an infj in my day to day life, life just feels harder with the way we over process things. People at work see me as kind of a weird and stressed out person lmao. 

That's why I like the infj reddit group, reminds me there's a few of us and we're actually really similar to one another, kinda comforting feeling some sense of belonging."

unpopularopinion,fa9kzf6,t1_fa9kkm7,1575878233.0,"Yeah, I understand this viewpoint but just can't relate.

A good relationship shouldn't stop someone in the relationship doing what they really want. 

Relationships are a source of belonging for many people (should never be the ultimate source of course) and I'd go as far to argue that many people like feeling that they are apart of a union and when their partner is (reasonably) protective over them."
