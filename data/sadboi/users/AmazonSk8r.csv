I read the Tao te ching like it’s poetry. As I read it, I think about what it might be trying to say and how it might relate to my life. It can be hard, but it’s not hard because it’s complicated. It’s hard because it goes against a lot of things that I’ve been taught.

Our society is rooted in Puritan ethics, and we practically worship things like “discipline.” But following it for its own sake is a trap, and it will not lead to fulfillment.

1. We all do shitty things sometimes. Frequency and severity of shittiness may differ, but most people have anecdotes in their lives of people being shittier than they are.

2. Our capacity for empathy, the best anti-shittiness indicator I can think of, probably follows a bell shaped distribution like any other human attribute. No matter how good humans are overall, one side is going to appear shittier than the other.

3. Most people are doing their best with the knowledge and resources they have to get by in their day to day lives, but...

4... We have a social order in place that ultimately rewards shittiness. You just don’t become a billionaire by being a good person. Shitty people are gaining the power to influence people who are much simpler, leading to, well, a ton of shit.

5. There seems to be a pattern toward non shittiness in the long run. I think the shittiness of today compares favorably to the shit of 200 years ago, and will likely be disgusting by standards 200 years in the future (provided that we manage to keep the environment alive that long.)
