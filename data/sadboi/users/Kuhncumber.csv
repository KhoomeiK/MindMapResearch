To keep a (now funny) story short, I was making a 12/13 hour drive all by myself when I was only 19 years old, to visit my girlfriend during spring break. As I‚Äôm from New Jersey, I never had to pump my own gas before this, so stopping out of state was my first time ever. Unfortunately I stopped in front of a diesel station instead of gasoline, and despite something feeling off, proceeded to fill my car with a full tank of diesel. Luckily right before I got back on the highway I noticed that my car was acting off and barely accelerating, so I swung back into the parking lot and when I turned the car off, it wouldn‚Äôt start back up. I had to get it towed, get an impromptu hotel room since the garage was closed (I got there right at closing time), and had to pray that the incoming snow storm wouldn‚Äôt keep them closed for the next day or two. Thankfully the area I was in only got a slight coating of snow, and they were able to open and clear out my tank, fixing my car and allowing me to continue my trip. Very stressful and upsetting in the moment, but a funny story to share now.
