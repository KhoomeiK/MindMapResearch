God cannot be ""proved"" or ""disproved"" because God is so completely unlike anything else in our lived experience. The fact that you are seeking God and that this causes you pain can be seen as evidence God exists. Many theologians have made this point, that the fact so many of us have a God-shaped hole means there must be Something to fill it. The one that pops in my head right now is Paul Tillich, but I know he's not the only one to make this point. I have totally been in your place before, in so much pain you question God's existence, and, eventually, it became a time to redefine God for myself.
