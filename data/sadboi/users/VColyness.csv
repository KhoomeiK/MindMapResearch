I get you see it as one that exists to ""annoy"" people since a lot of posts here in recent days have related to you in particular, but when people do and say the bullshit they do, they deserve to get called out on it.

Everytime i see a video of someone lazily lipsyncing a song or audio clip, those videos have maybe like 40 likes from that person's followers while videos like the ones I described above are the generally the ones that have hundreds of thousands of likes.

Also, a little nitpick, there's no reason for you to add the last sentence on this sub. Of course you said what you said, this sub is for unpopular opinions, literally every post here says that without actually saying it"
unpopularopinion,fp531um,t3_gbcrzi,1588314703.0,"This is one of the reasons why subs for things like games, movies, shows, etc. Should require each post to have a flair for what the post is about. If someone wants to post a clip of a trickshot, there should be a flair category for Clips. If someone wants to post fanart, there should be a flair category for art. That way, if people only want to see a certain type of post, they can sort by that flair so they only see that kind. An example of a sub that does this is r/FortNiteBR (haha yes, I mentioned fortnite, downvote me). They require each post to have a post flair for a specific category, and the post is removed if it does not. It's strange how there are so many subreddits that do not do something like this."
