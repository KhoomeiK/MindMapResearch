For example, I live in Africa and feel like one of the most important ways to help people is simply to give a bit of money towards that, so it's a simple small donation and doesn't require any time on my part.

For those things that really take time, I think the best thing to do is to decide what skillset you have and help others develop that.  Again, sorry to share my stuff, but it's what I know.  I have taught your guides for years in my career, and I've taught programming in those times in my life where I had time to do that.  In those teaching settings you really can have an impact on the lives of others, way beyond what you're teaching.  You know what your situation is and how you can use that to help others.  There might be many ways.

I think an important way to look at it is to think of helping others not so much as just helping others.  Genuinely helping people is a great way to build your own self esteem, to learn and to build a group of people around you who support you back.  Lots of opportunities in my life these days come very directly from those I helped or trained many years back.

Simple things can go a long way.  Just reaching out to people here on Reddit who are hurting or need help can be very uplifting.

At the end of the day, you'll have to test and schedule to make all the things you do work for your life.  But at the end of the day, error on the side of helping others more... It will be a way more fulfilling life."

mentalhealth,fq8xzax,t3_ghhxb4,1589178922.0,"Hi.  Yes, I had similar feelings for many years, and in some situations, I still do.  In my case I can't blame my parents at all, they were super supportive.

I'll give you my suggestions, though I'm far, far from an expert.  My only reason to feel confident in some of what I have to say is because I did lots of reading about these things, and made sure that my own kids didn't end up with these issues, trying to overcome them myself, and generally taking an interest in helping others.

I think one of the biggest first steps is to convince yourself that generally 99% of what people are thinking is about themselves.  They might judge you, but actually they're far more concerned, just like you are, about themselves and what others think about them.  One way that I've done this is with some little script I write for myself that I read daily, because this isn't a quick fix. You'll need time for this to sink in.

Another thing that helps us starting a gratitude ritual.  This isn't going to change anything fast, but if you can start a daily gratitude journal where you mention just a few things that your grateful for, and a few things that you accomplished, no matter how simple.  Don't overthink it, and totally small simple things count.  You can be grateful for a nice shower, working internet (I live in Africa, so it's special to us), feeling healthy all day, etc.  Accomplishments to can be super simple - brushed your teeth, made your bed, completed something, etc

Then another thing is to work hard on confidence.  There are great books, if you're ok to read, and there are lots of things on YouTube and even here on Reddit.  A big thing is small wins.  Rack up lots of small wins, list them and read them over.

There is a well known book ""feel the fear, and do it anyway"" which I actually think the biggest message of the book is actually the title.  The more you do things you feel just slightly scared to do, the more confident you feel in that thing.  Building small amounts of confidence regularly adds up to a body of confidence over time.

The last bit of advice I'll give is self compassion.  You're ok.  Make a regular routine of telling yourself that.

I really hope something in this is helpful to you!  There isn't an easy quick fix.  Be patient with yourself."
introvert,fq8tvkj,t3_ghgckp,1589175384.0,"I think that it's one of the most frustrating things when you're an introvert.  In my younger years those were the conversations and taunts that I dreaded the most.

It's the most frustrating because it has the total opposite effect, making you embarrassed which just makes you feel so the more introverted.

The best advice I can give (NO EXPERT here at all), is not too join the judgement.  Be kind to yourself, accept yourself.  You'll find your people in situations in life, and around those you'll be open and interesting.  For the rest, keep to yourself, and be kind to yourself."

There's actually some really useful info on helping people on Reddit, easy to find it you look.

mentalhealth,fq6e1cl,t3_gh4hsk,1589129710.0,"I'm NO expert, but I'll share some thoughts.

Firstly, you don't bring anyone to the Reddit chat.  They come here on their own.  If you reached out to them, no matter what you say and do, you're not ""responsible for their suicide"".

Sometimes a claim that you're going to commit suicide might be just a way to get attention.  And, in that case, perhaps the little attention you give them is helpful.

Sometimes it might be a last act of desperation, and simple chatting through some online text messages isn't going to be an easy fix for the deep set of things that brings someone to that point.

My personal approach, both in real life and on messaging apps is never too even try to help, but rather to simply say, hey, I'm another human, and I'm here to listen if you feel like chatting.  I've had long lasting friendships online start through that simple act, but on the other hand, I'm sure that some of the people I reached out to like that might have gone on to following through on their side threats.

Lots of people are hurting, and being someone who's concerned and reaching out is going to help some.  And for those it doesn't help, it's certainly not your fault for trying."

There are excellent resources to developing your courage.  One good technique is to start pushing your comfort zone.  Don't do this all at once, you'll just get overwhelmed.  But pick one thing someone might react negatively to, but the one that's going to bother you the least.  Say maybe  you feel most comfortable with your mom - ok, well exercise and look weird to her,  and do this on a regular basis  until that's no big deal anymore.

You can go about this whole thing looking at this as a chance to develop courage, because the better you can handle fear, stress and anxiety and not  let those  control you, the further you get in this whole thing of  'deciding to do better'.  Courage doesn't come just because  you have grown up.  It comes from growing it like a plant.
