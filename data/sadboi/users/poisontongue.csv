All lives matter or some fake bullshit that mischaracterizes the issue."
CPTSD,fq2hg2q,t3_gg9jlj,1589056170.0,"I read this this morning and have been trying to get to the bottom of it...

I feel like my need to show it is the equivalent of a dog rolling over and showing their belly. It's an equivalent of being so flawed and incapable of fitting in with ""normalcy""... like, maybe people will understand why, and understanding is good, because who has ever understood me before? Maybe it will convince them to be gentler and not attack me like most people do. They'll back off, like they do with a possum.

And maybe it's the illusion of a deeper connection. Yearning for a real understanding, a real connection, an expression of innermost secrets, of pain that scarcely makes sense and is still inadequately expressed. Something that will never be lessened.

To make someone understand and actually take notice, because no one ever bothered, and there is no way to connect on any sort of ""normal"" basis. Things aren't going to change for me... but people always demand that you prove yourself and act in a socially-acceptable way, which is unfair and unhelpful.

Plus, showing weakness is almost like dodging the full brunt of reality, responsibility, anger, blame, and all the harshness that normally comes with it. It almost becomes performance art. They won't yell at me and treat me like shit if they realize that I too am flawed or even inferior. Avoiding confrontation, again.

Of course, who *really* cares? When does anything change? When does normalcy become possible? When is there any sort of lasting soul connection?

Life itself seems like pain. No matter what shape, even if this present looks better on paper than any of the alternatives, and lacking hope that there is a better alternative left... :("
CPTSD,fq2fljn,t3_ggj84i,1589055666.0,"Same... dare criticize the system and bad things happen. At best, people just tell you to try again. At worst... jeeze. People get really vociferous about psychology and medication, almost to the point of cultism. They don't want to hear about its shortcomings.

It's not even mere mistreatment, it's that they hold all the power in this equation when it should be the other way around. They tell you it's the other way around sometimes, at least the ones that make a pretense of trust and all that. But it's not. When you become a part of that system, you're essentially trapped within it permanently (if you're lucky enough to heal and look mostly ""normal,"" then you might escape eventually). How can they ever be wrong? They're the ""experts."" Even though they don't live your life and aren't inside your head.

I just feel like a guinea pig with nothing to show for it - except further distrust and hopelessness, too. The whole ""reduce the stigma"" notion sounds rather hollow when the system itself creates so many victims.

I'm really sorry for anyone who goes through this crap, the injustice is beyond aggravating."

Well, the crisis is showing what a failure capitalism is then. It left us completely unprepared and now they demand human sacrifice to prop it up. The worst part is anyone could have seen this from a mile away if they wanted to. Just the irony, though, of the GOP pretending that it's about saving lives long-term when they've done nothing but cause economic hardship and pillage the country for their own bank accounts... then couching it in a ""freedom"" astroturf movement again."
