BPD,fpurlpo,t3_gegnp0,1588921363.0,"Does anyone else always feel completely alone? Mostly because those in your life could never truly understand the struggle you go through on a daily basis? My bf calls me a freak when something triggers me. My parents don‚Äôt believe in mental illness. Two of my siblings are narcissists who always have to be the best, so they thrive off of my shortcomings. It seems as though my friends are too caught up in their own lives to care about me, even though I‚Äôm always there for them. It makes me want to SCREAM. 

Does anyone else think being over sensitive ruins their social life to an extent? I‚Äôll spend hours re-playing scenarios or things people have told me in my mind, trying to determine whether they were being hostile or if I‚Äôm overreacting. For this reason, as I‚Äôve gotten older, I avoid socializing way more than I used to. Grading myself on every social interaction I have is EXHAUSTING. 

Speaking of socializing, does anyone else‚Äôs paranoia cause self-sabotaging behavior? I was so paranoid an old friend was plotting against me and talking badly about me to other girls in our friend group that I stopped being friends with ALL OF THEM. In hindsight, were they gossips and occasionally mean? Yes. But, were they trying to push me out of the group? No. 

I have similar scenarios at work where I convince myself someone is talking about/doesn‚Äôt like me despite having no solid evidence. From then on I assume they are turning everyone against me, one by one.

Last, but not least‚Äî 
Does anyone else wonder when the confusion will end? The incessant confusion about my identity is overwhelming. How am I supposed to have high self-esteem when I don‚Äôt know who I am or if I am even real? Am I always going to feel this way?"
