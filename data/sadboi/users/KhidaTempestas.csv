To make a LONG LONG story short, I moved 1,000 miles away to get away from an unhealthy situation. Have been bouncing around ever since. Moved in with a friend so they could get their ex out. After a month of me paying my bills early, cleaning around the house, and being what I thought was a good roommate, they decided I need to leave. I don‚Äôt make a ton of money, I don‚Äôt currently have a car (I was saving up for one), and desperately trying to find a place to go. I was 4 days post op when they told me I need to leave, and I had also broken my front tooth that day. I ended up relapsing and drinking for the first time in 3 and a half years.

Today they told me I basically have 3 weeks to get out. I‚Äôve spent $175 on Lyfts in the last week to get to and from work (they also used to drive me and I helped with gas, until I could get a car of my own).

I know I‚Äôll be fine, somehow I will be. But I can‚Äôt help but feel stressed, anxious, terrified."

Wishlist,fg2wup8,t3_ewj3wg,1580459398.0,"Happy Birthday! You gotta tell me if you got anything weird or unique, I love clever gifts. If nothing like that, weirdest gift ever?

My best was actually my most recent birthday. I was living with my (now ex) boyfriend (we‚Äôre still friends) and I guess at some point early in our relationship I had mentioned my love for Pok√©mon Blue, because it was the first Pok√©mon game I ever had as a kid. And I must have said a lot about it (I have memory problems) because how this went down made me cry for hours and I still cry thinking about it. Buckle in, it‚Äôs story time.

I moved 2,000 miles from home, on my own. Packed my whole life into two suitcases, a carryon, and a backpack. Went through some nasty shit, and this guy genuinely saved my life. I was in a dark place when we met. He comes off as very cold and mean, but he‚Äôs the sweetest man I‚Äôve ever had the blessing to love. He comforted me, listened to me, and we just fell for each other. He even helped me get back on track and get therapy and medical care I really needed.

I guess when I had talked about Pok√©mon Blue, I mentioned what I could remember from my original team. I remembered my first starter ever, Squirtle, who is still my favorite starter to date. I talked about how I worked hard and got everyone to level 100 to take on the Elite Four, and how much I celebrated when I beat them. I was so young, 7 or 8.

For my birthday, I had told him I wanted a Switch and Pok√©mon Let‚Äôs Go Pikachu. Which he went and got me both, and I was so overwhelmed by that. Keep in mind, I genuinely expected nothing because he doesn‚Äôt do birthdays or holidays‚Äîlike I said, he seems cold and mean for the most part.

But the icing on the cake? A GameBoy advance, the same kind I had as a kid (I must have mentioned that too???) and a copy of Pok√©mon Blue. It was extra magical because I had to work on my birthday, and because of the weather it was dead nearly all day, aside from some regulars (who got me sushi!).

He even said I better have a rerun of my original play through. Still working on it! I‚Äôm a lot busier as an adult than as a kid! But my beloved Shellshockr is killing it!

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to express how much I loved him for this. The fact he listened and remembered that much from one silly conversation talking about our love for video games (he‚Äôs a huge gamer, I was always my happiest on the couch with him watching him play whatever game he was playing) and got me such a beautiful gift.

I‚Äôm really sentimental about it. At the time my family and I weren‚Äôt speaking, and I‚Äôm 2,000 miles away from everything and everyone I know. He was really all I had. It just meant so much. I want to do something special like that for him someday."
