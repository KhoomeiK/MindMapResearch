\#1 be ok on your own. Your friends or lack of friends don't define you. 1 or 2 good (real) friends is far better than a bunch. Its not a numbers game its a quality thing. 

\#2 Find people that are into the same things you are and befriend them.  I find it hard to believe theres nobody else in your area to be friends with. What's your hobby? Cars, sports, comic books... Find activities with like-minded people. 

\#3 Get the F off social media. Unless thats where you're connecting with people to MIRL. Use it as a tool and thats it.

Wiring, aside from ditching the terminal block (Oh s\*\*t) I see at least one goof. One of the Y steppers is flipped on the polarity. I can see that screwing up the Y but I don't think it would affect Z and X. Those are wired correctly. 

 Configuring, I followed that page also and that's exactly the same settings. The only difference is I'm running 0.9 and not 0.8. I think I read the config was basically the same."

cursedcomments,f33qps2,t3_dfkdyz,1570643373.0,Fuck If I knew my dead body was going to get strapped to a chair and blown up Id sign up for that. Even better one of those rocket sled things that slams into a wall at like 600 mph. Hell yeah!!!! One last ride.
AskRedditAfterDark,f33q7t5,t3_dfjx1k,1570643113.0,Please don't downvote me for this but an absolute no is a religious girl. I'm an Athiest and no matter what she looks like or how nice she is I know from experience it's not going to work out. I have nothing against any religion I just know its not for me. Aside from that looks-wise Im pretty open to most.

loseit,f3117hm,t1_f30zc4u,1570566174.0,"No not that I had BDD at all thats not what I meant. I'm not sure how to describe it but basically she thinks I'm actually doing quite well with the situation. It's just that I personally see things far worse.  For example just a few things she outlined for me.

 I'm a great father and love my kids completely and I'm looking out for their best interests in the coming divorce. I'm self-employed not making allot but covering my responsibilities and it leaves time for me to be a full-time student with a 4.0 GBA. I'm working on getting the weight off in a healthy way.  I'm actively seeking therapy to be even better and rid myself of my personal issues. etc. etc...

But again if you ask me directly Ive failed at all these things and find it very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Every day it's a battle to say I'm worth it, I'm worth fixing (she hates that word) and that in the end, I'll be stronger.  Like BDD these are people that are actually attractive and have an irrational perception of themselves. I apparently am displaying an irrational perception of my own personality/traits and no matter what I've been told (so far) I find it hard to believe/accept. I hope this makes more sense."
