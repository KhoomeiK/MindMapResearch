Conquest: Taking of land from another ESTABLISHED nation. 


If you want something to compare it to, compare to the colonisation of Australia or Africa. And we also use words like ""took and stole"" there. Regardless, we absolutely use ""took and stole"" when discussing conquered territories.

BPDrecovery,fqsotg3,t1_fqrn1cn,1589613691.0,"Okay. One thing that people with BPD CONSTANTLY get wrong about BPD, is they claim they are highly empathetic individuals. This is not true.

True empathy involves ACTUALLY thinking about the thoughts and feelings of another person, and how THEY feel. In a lot of cases, we do not do this. This is why we have so many struggles with interpersonal relationships. What we DO, is we make assumptions based on OUR own thoughts and feelings. Sure this means we ""totally know how people feel"" a lot of the time. And often we are correct, because most people just need the obvious pointed out to them. But we are 100% not 'empaths'. A lack of empathy causing interpersonal struggles is literally one of the defining features of BPD.

You do not have psychic powers. You are just making assumptions about people you just met, or about situations. If you really do think you have BPD, you probably are prone to making an unhealthy amount of assumptions. Just because sometimes you are right does not mean you have a gift, it is just common sense that you'd be right sometimes. 

Finally this kind of ""I am special because of my assumed mental health disorder"" thinking is quite dangerous. And frankly as someone with BPD I'm a little offended. Please for your own sake stop trying to conflate a genuine mental health concern with 'fun' make-believe thinking."

People getting mad over the idea of punishment are just as silly at the people getting mad at the idea of rehabilitation. I suppose there are a lot of people here that believe it is only 1 or the other somehow? This just isn't true. That's not what a rehabilitation system is. These people are still locked up, and they aren't living a normal life. They ARE getting punished. 

Rehabilitation just means you attempt to... for lack of a better work... 'fix' them during this punishment period. You don't reward them with less punishment, you make them understand WHY they are being punished and continue punishment. And most (not all) function better after this. As opposed to America which (often) doesn't try to fix at all. They JUST punish in most (not all) prisons and then release these still broken people at the end of it. With that system the amount of time spent inside makes no difference, other than to try to put a fear of going back into them. And fear is not a good way of controlling an already unstable person.

Seriously you're doing this much, spending every possible moment with her and giving in to her wishes, and then claiming YOU'RE upsetting her because she can't deal with her own emotions? This is seriously messed up. Also if you genuinely believe this is ""all your fault"" then I'd recommend you also talk to a therapist cause that's some really maladaptive thinking. Either you have some underlying issues or this person is toxic and has really messed your thinking up.

It's not your job to make someone happy. That is not how a relationship works. You need to have your own happiness and share in that. Being this desperate to make someone else happy is opening yourself up to emotional abuse. The desperation to please only makes it sound like you're already experiencing that. If that abuse is coming from her (which in part it DEFINITELY is, at least in the form of neglecting your emotions) or internally it's hard to tell from this post. But either way you need to stop it.

As others have said this is a mead. ""Miod Pitny"" Mead Drink ""Półtorak"" The grade of the mead. Will get to this in a sec. ""Jadwiga"" Brand name.


A półtorak mead specifies a mead that is made with the lowest dilution of water (1 part mead : 0.5 part water) and I believe also must be aged for 3 years. This makes it more expensive. Mead isn't really like whiskey. Being aged for longer doesn't really imply it's better. What it does mean is that this mead will be sweet. REALLY sweet. Not something you'd drink like a standard alcohol. Ever had dessert wine? Cause it's basically the mead version of dessert wine. So think very small glasses of this paired with cake after a meal, rather than a drink to get drunk off.


APIS is the producer name, and 1932 their founding date. 

This mead is described as:

""Mead with a distinctive, piquant taste. Produced with the addition of raspberry and dog-rose fruits.""
Piquant meaning a sharp/almost bitter style of taste. Oh and as you can see on the label it's 16% so like a medium strong wine.


Here's a link to this mead on their English site:

http://apis.pl/en/honey/poltorak-jadwiga/

Notice the many different styles of bottles shown on the site. This is pretty common. The bottle changed just depending on when it was bottled but also depending on the target market for the drink. With a bottle as ridiculously over designed as this style I would assume this bottle would rarely be sold inside Poland proper. This kind of bottle in particular is more likely aimed at being sold to foreigners, so think speciality import stores outside of Poland, or the high-end world alcohol shops found in the duty free section of a airport. 
(I could definitely be wrong about this, but this is typical of other products like this I've seen. Being aimed at foreigners says nothing of the quality inside, it's just that in these environments there is more of a need for the bottle to 'stand out' as it were)


On average this mead seems to cost about 24€ - 30€ depending on the bottle, which is fairly pricey for mead. 


All in all I'm very jealous!  This seems like a wonderful gift!"

If you check the links in the sidebar/community info, ""A Concise Polish Grammer"" has a good write up on it, although you may need to look up the meaning of some IPA symbols. There are a total of 6 *slightly* varying pronunciations. A good baseline would be to go with in general would be ""ow̃""/""ew̃"". 

This isn't nearly as difficult as it sounds though. Basically you just make a voiced nasal sound with your mouth & tongue in the position that they'll be with for the next consonant. (E.g. ąb will sound kinda like ""omb"") Knowing the right pronunciation is really just a matter of practice on how to pronounce the other consonants correctly.

So like my thinking is always a bit like this but manageable. But if I ever find my thinking is becoming extreme black/white or extreme in other ways, I just have to accept ""okay, my thinking is compromised right now"". 

Then, with the help of someone I trust  (but never EVER having 1 'go to' person, that's just playing fire with attachment issues and risking toxic 'favourite person' thinking in me), I will talk through:

(1)  What has caused that thinking or what the trigger was

(2) How my behaviour and thinking has been while I am feeling compromised

(3) How long it is lasting, in the sense of ""well of this happened in the past I'd usually be this way for 2 weeks but have calmed down faster by doing xwz, or had it become worse from xyz""

(4) Is trying to understand my thinking at this time causing me to feel something that is affecting my ability to think for myself:  distress, anxiety, fear, etc etc. The answer is always yes tbh, which is WHY the black/white thinking takes hold like it does in me. Cause there are too many emotions to think straight for my own and my ""disordered personality"" thinking takes over as a defence mechanism.

This really calms me down usually. By going through things like this I get a good sense of ""this is normal for me and that is OK"", ""I am trying to stop bad thinking, and *trying* means I am deserving of self respect even if progress is poor"", & finally again ""my thinking is compromised"" meaning I am more able to accept that I shouldn't follow through with the more impulsive crazy actions.

Sometimes after particularly heavy emotional events I will immediately self isolate until I am ready to talk like this with someone. Couple weeks usually. Until then my mind is a fire of irrational thinking and jumping to extremes, but I am usually good at not letting it take over my behaviour and just try my hardest to distract myself and sleep."

The Emperor has *always* been a warlord tyrant. An exceedingly powerful one at that. But brute force is his preferred method of action. The Unification Wars, The Great Crusade, his preference for obligerating things rather than let Alien's/other Human civilisations have them, none of it screams 'genius' mastermind IMO. 

So we have this power hungry warlord with a complete disregard for the lives of others and absolutely no ability to have empathy, BEFORE he basically became a god. He was always like that. He might have been strong beforehand but he went and made himself far more powerful than ever with whatever went down at Molech. And probably can now see the whole 4D-hyperchess going on. But he's a brute, he always was, and that effects HOW he plays the game. 

I think there's no need for the more extreme aspects of the Imperium during 30k. All the warmongering, disgusting disregard for life (servitors and the sheer death his crusades bring), use of slaves & child soldiers, and just being generally awful. None of it 'must' happen. The Emperor just doesn't know how else to be. Eldrad might be a massive dick but at least he cares about his own people, and he is playing chess too. No the Emperor is just looking at Fate, and is just acting like he always has in the *hope* that it works out, all while acting like this self-righteous superman who ""totally has a plan and understands what he is doing"".

BPDrecovery,fgwdoxr,t1_fgw3j4g,1581159963.0,"Yeah everything you've said feelings wise is incredibly normal! 

As for the homework, not prying too much at all I don't think. To give an example of one I found very difficult was near the end, I wanna say homework 9 or 10:

""Make note and think about how you react to a recent experience of being let down, misunderstood, or ignored by someone close to you"". 

It's a feeling I'm sure you might know well. That feeling is probably one of the biggest and most common triggers for me personally that bring about my BPD symptoms. So it's very natural that focusing on an event like that is going to bring back a lot of those feelings and feel quite stressful!

I had nothing in the last week that had really brought up those feelings, which meant nothing was quite as 'fresh' for me so I probably did have an easier time there. Some people in the group had gone through that during the week meaning it was still a sensitive thing to think about and to put on paper. But on the flipside, since I didn't have any recent examples whenever I sat down to do it my mind kept gravitating to the more.. extreme reactions that I'd had in the past.

But it really was nothing to worry about. I felt more than ready by that point to tackle that particular homework despite it being hard. And the knowledge that I could talk about anything it brought up in particular during a future 1 on 1 was quite comforting. And finally when the next week came, going through the homework in the group really helped me feel that I'm not alone, and in time practising this stuff on my own has really helped me get over judging/feeling ashamed of my own reactions, which unexpectedly makes controlling them to begin with way easier. 

The homework was really well paced IMO. There's never a 'right' answer. Even ""it was too hard to put anything on paper"" is an OK answer! It's attempting the homework and making note of how it makes you feel which is the more important part!"

(2) Do NOT try to diagnose other people. You are not a psychiatrist and CLEARLY do not have a clear understanding of what BPD is.

BPDrecovery,fgtoaro,t1_fgtkjhj,1581107270.0,Ah my bad. When I mentioned posting about it before I meant the main BPD sub. Didn't notice which I was on.
BPDrecovery,fgtkjhj,t3_f0fib1,1581105766.0,"Hi, I did the MBT-i part of the course (initial 12 weeks of learning and practice) as well as the pre main group 1 on 1 sessions that usually accompany it. After the 12 weeks were up, me and the practicioner I was working with agreed that my understanding of the concepts and my desire to practice it in my day to day life meant that the year long course maybe wasn't going to be a good fit for me personally. The opportunity to have done the initial MBT-i course was what REALLY benefited me. Honestly, that initial 12 weeks were the best thing I've done in my life as far as therapy goes, and I have been through the ringer and tried almost everything. 

I would actually avoid looking into it too much prior. The structure of the initial period is quite well done and introduces things quite slowly in a way that I think really helps get around the anxiety.

If it is the combined 1 on 1 & group based MBT like I did, here are some things to expect:

A lot of anxiety, especially initially. But don't worry  at all, it's all about finding that 'sweet spot' where you're anxious enough to really be in touch with your feelings, and not too anxious to shut down.

Not everyone will be at the same level as you, and that's OK. Just be as non judgemental as you can. Sometimes it was feeling like someone wasn't understanding it or listening at all, or sometimes it was feeling that someone was WAY ahead of me in getting it. It's all natural. Sometimes I'd think that someone didn't fit in the group (will explain further next) but you have to trust the judgement of the practicioners. By the end, I'd notice I had way more in common with everyone in that room than I first thought.

Sometimes I felt that some people there were trying to use the group in the same way you would use an AA meeting. Just a place for them to vent as opposed to a place to learn. This isn't really the point of the group, and usually stems from a lack of mentalization at the time. But you just have to be patient of those people, the practicioners will be on it and will try to keep things on track.

Not everyone in my group was BPD. But everyone struggled with mentalization. Sometimes it was understanding how a lack of mentalization affected other disorders was what made the concept more clear in myself.

Homework every week (i think anyway it has been a while). And sometimes it was HARD. Bringing yourself to complete it can be difficult. But it was always worthwhile to do, as the whole point is to be able to talk the next week not about the just contents of the homework (it can be personal and you're not forced to share), but how doing the homework made you feel.

Be open to everything. And try to be as honest as you can in the group.

The first few weeks especially, a very common feeling in our group was: "".... what?"". The concepts can be confusing and not intuitive. Don't stress about that, it's very natural and to learn those concepts is the whole point of MBT.

That's everything really. Good luck! Would be very interested in seeing a post in the future about how you feel the course is going for you. I believe it is THE best treatment for helping people with BPD, and yet whenever I've posted about it here in the past I've had very little feedback. Makes sense though, especially with it being so new."

Paula has her issues just as much as Rebacca does, and we see that especially regarding her relationship with Rebacca. 

As far as the abortion thing goes though it does kinda make sense IMO. I'm having similar problems in my own life atm so I can relate. One friend in particular that has always been VERY self involved has heard I went through something quite traumatic recently. Now they're trying to push me to talk to them and keep telling me that I can, but I don't *'feel'* like I can. Because irrelevant of how much change they might be making, I don't know that for sure. The entire relationship up to this point has been built on them being kind of selfish and me always helping with/listening to their problems even when I'd try to bring up my own. I've fed into that in a way I know I shouldn't have by trying to always be the 'supportive' parent type in the past with them. And now even when they DO ask for me to open up, I feel like they're just being self serving. Like they just want me to open up just so they can feel like a 'good friend' for listening.

And open, honest conversation with therapists about these things is what will help, and then they can also understand ""what is wrong with you"" by working with you to understand YOU, and not to see you as a stereotype of a diagnosis. 'Borderline personality disorder' does not explain WHY those things happen. That's not how personality disorders work.

Think of it more of a term that's convenient for knowing what symptoms to expect in a patient who isn't self aware or a patient who has VERY long term reccuring difficulties and struggles to deal with these issues directly in therapy. Only talking with your therapist and other professionals to figure out where in your past that these feelings and behaviours come from will truly help you understand what's causing this stuff. And if you're willing to do that now, it'll be much easier than doing so after your early 20s.

Also I'm sorry if I come off as heartless I don't mean to. Internet writing is hard. You are 100% in the right place to discuss what you're dealing with as everyone here gets it. This is a safe space for you to share these feelings, official diagnosis or not. I just wouldn't want to see your search for a diagnosis get in the way of getting help for the things you're aware of.

And I'm so sorry to hear that you're having to deal with this stuff so young. But you're self aware, and you're actively seeking answers, and both those things are amazing, truly.

But tl;dr: The DSM-5 list you're looking at are common *symptoms* that help a professional consider if BPD may be the cause for recurring episodes showing those symptoms, so they can start looking at certain kinds of therapy. Fitting the DSM-5 criteria is NOT the same as having BPD, as anyone could fit those symptoms during times of crisis and especially during adolescence.

Please listen to your therapist, I understand the want for a label, but it does nothing for you. Attempts at self diagnosis of any mental health disorder will get you focusing on the symptoms when all you should be focusing on is improving your quality of life through therapy and learnable skills. If you're being honest with them about what you're going through, then the help you'll be getting will be the same regardless of if they put a (really detrimental) label on you."
BPD,fgo10b9,t1_fgnyq11,1580957307.0,"I think on a lot of levels we can relate to them. A lot of the underlying problems they deal with are the same. But the most common problem we have as BPD individuals is a lack of cognitive empathy in interpersonal relationships. Or rather, we project our own thinking on people rather than TRULY understanding how they think.  That's why intimate relationships are so difficult for us.

So no matter how much we might *know* they aren't capable of caring, we see the similarities in how we act/think (and there are many, both personality disorders after all), then can't help assuming our own extreme emotional empathy is also present in them. Because like with most people we interact with, we assume their thinking is the same as ours either because of the similarities we see or just from misreading things. And this can lead to very easy manipulation of our thinking when they pick up on this.

The only true way for us to interact with them (or any other kind of personality disorder) is to be acutely aware at all times to NOT make any assumptions about how they think and to always question how they present their thinking. And in the case of NDP/ASPD especially, always be aware that they are most likely very purposefully not being genuine to us or themselves."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fgnyoq6,t3_ezkp51,1580955816.0,"The way you've described feeling initially (looking through a mask, not your hands) sounds a lot like a dissociative episode. If this is new to you, I'd recommend keeping your Doctor informed.

Visual hallucinations aren't exactly common with dissociation, but can be caused even in someone with no other mental disorders simply from over tiredness especially caused by illness.

This to consider are:

Did you not get a lot of sleep? You mentioned being tired the night before.

Have you been sleeping poorly in general lately?

Any new medications? Or any cold specific medications?

Irrelevant of whatever it is, you really might wanna consider informing a Doctor."
BPD,fgnt3ky,t3_ezj5hw,1580952314.0,"I've had it both ways. This is how it is for me personally:

The crying hysterical times came from a place of interpersonal distress. Impossible levels of awful feelings and intrusive thoughts. Mind constantly racing, absolutely manic. The feelings I was having were real and valid, but they were born from attempts of emotional manipulation & attention seeking. Everything from my God awful behaviour, huge amounts of self pity, and the horrid shame and intrusive compulsions to tell people afterwards, especially those I tried to get close to for a while.

The 1 time it wasn't like that, that was more recent. My latest, 2018. I didn't want attention. I didn't want pity. I was just.. so, so tired. Living felt pointless. No extreme emotions before or after. I knew those extreme emotions are in me, I still do, but I was and am so numb to everything by now that I can't feel anything. I don't want to. I'm tired of feeling. I just wanted things to stop. 

So for me personally, the first stems from mania, whereas the latter stems from depression. You're certainly not alone. Would be interested in hearing if you could relate to the latter.

Edit: By the way, please stick a TW: Suicide flair on this, as opposed to DAE. It's quite an an unassuming title ya know? I certainly wasn't expecting to think about this tonight when I clicked. I am glad you brought this up though, it's something I need to shy away from less if I'm ever going to get past it."

I don't know if this is something good or bad, but I'll answer absolutely truthfully for myself: I don't hate anyone here. I can't. There are so many people here that I have absolutely no idea who anyone is. I take every post on a case by case basis because of this. I don't bother trying to keep track of people at all.

Maybe they didn't respond, but maybe even if they had nothing to say they still felt like they could relate. Maybe they really needed that, and without even knowing it, you helped make that person's day a little bit better by being brave enough to write what you did.

It's great of you to reach out to a community when you have newly been diagnosed. If I could give any advise it's this:

Do not make this disorder ""who you are"". Don't wear it like a label. Use this diagnosis as a basis for what to tackle in therapy, and as a basis for maybe finding people you can relate to like you already have done, but that's all. If you had diabetes, you wouldn't feel the need to tell everyone you meet ""Hi, I'm diabetes"". 

Stay in therapy as much as possible. 

Try your best to work with therapists to get a better understanding of what BPD is, what causes it, and what it means.

Don't normalise having attachment issues. A lot of people online fail at this one. You'll read the term ""favourite person"" a lot around here and will pick up quite quickly on what it means. Please keep in mind that this style of relationship is not healthy and will only make it harder to work on getting better. Not impossible, but much harder. This doesn't mean avoid love! But... sometimes love can be overwhelming, and you've gotta be able to keep your head and not make some else the centre of your entire world. The only centre of your world should be you.

Avoid enabling the behaviour you want to change. That's the ""It's not my fault I acted that way, I have BPD"" mentality. The more you avoid this the more progress you can make.

Those last 2 might've been a bit in depth, but I'd really recommend talking to a therapist about those ideas sometime when all this feels a bit less new and confusing.

And finally: Progress in therapy might be slow. It might be frustrating. But as long as you're going at your own pace then you're doing the best possible thing for yourself. You'll probably have setbacks and feel like you are absolutely back at square one every time. But as long as you keep trying, you are never really back at square one. Getting back to where you were will be faster and easier. And you'll get better and better at it. Eventually, you'll get so good at it, you won't even feel like you have BPD anymore. But at that point, keep practicing mindfulness, and try to remember everything you've learned over the years. You'll have less relapses, and a more fulfilling life that way."

Incredibly strong feelings of grief, even a lifetime after the loss, is completely normal in any person no matter what. And feelings of grief triggering a 'breakdown' in thinking/behaviour is definitely NOT something unique to BPD and is again a really common human response, even years after the case. To disregard or invalidate those feelings in yourself would be by far the more unhealthy way to deal with them, and to do so in another person, especially so soon, implies a severe failure of empathy or sympathy.

I'm so, so sorry for your loss by the way."
BPD,fge91kc,t1_fge2mtn,1580694133.0,"This is true, although you've absolutely hit the nail on the head with your conclusion IMO. Except rather than a subtype, what I see touted online as 'quiet BPD' is the exact struggles that most all BPD people deal with internally regardless of how they might be presenting on the outside.

There's been attempts to classify BPD in different subtypes but it really doesn't change much for the individual. The end goal of therapy and coping methods taught are all the same regardless of presentation. It's much more for the sake of the therapist to be able to more accurately identify the disorder in people who may not fit the classic expression of BPD as opposed to accidentally labelling them with a different personality disorder where the methods used in therapy may vary slightly. (I think, but I won't pretend I know exactly how other personality disorders are treated)

The entire rest of this post is purely speculation and my opinion: 

We MAY in future see a split with BPD diagnosis, as it is definitely the broadest personality disorder category in terms of how varied the behaviours and thinking of pwBPD are, but I'm doubtful. Nowadays with better understanding of the specific ways a person's thinking, emotional regulation, and attachment styles can be disordered I imagine the focus of therapy is shifting towards looking at all personality disorders on a case by case basis, and the need of the categories becoming less important.

Also I like your use of the term made up haha, as keep in mind all personality disorder classifications have been made up! Unlike things like depression where we have a good understanding of the biology and it's effect on the brain, which is the 'proof' behind those classifications, personality disorders are much less understood. But even then, before depression was properly understood to the level it is today, it's classification was too entirely 'made up' in that way!"

And *REALLY* good point in mentioning how claiming the internal struggles are a different disorder implies that's not what we deal with. That could in fact be very invalidating to the feelings of a person diagnosed with BPD, especially where public perception is concerned. 

I feel like it's in part not wanting to be associated with the more 'extreme' behaviours, and in part a lack of understanding that those 9 criteria as used for the sake of helping initial patient diagnosis as opposed to being an explanation of what BPD is! This is exactly one of the reasons why most doctors will tell you to please not look up BPD online by yourself when they first bring it up."

It's got the same use as ""favourite person"" in that way. 

I just wanted to explain why you probably won't hear it in a clinical setting. And also these articles seen online along the lines of ""Do you have quiet BPD?"" seem to be a big draw in people trying to self diagnose themselves as the ""symptoms"" listed in these articles are usually just ways that ALL people feel sometimes.

TL;DR: Yeah I think people often mistake being emotionally reactive with what I've always thought as true empathy. Both are valid and have uses but we should try to avoid confusing the two as I think it detracts from our desire (generalizing but I assume most people desire this) to really get better at understanding our loved ones and avoid our common interpersonal problems.

Weed really did feel like it mellowed me out, well depending on the strain anyway, but all that's really done long term is make it near impossible to put any work into becoming emotional stable without the drug. It's only recently again I cut it out cold turkey and recovery is really slow. I feel a lot of regret over spending the last 2 years self medicating instead of putting in any real effort to improving my mental health. I only got high because it was easier than learning to really deal with my daily emotional turmoil.

I also do not mean to sound judgy, I am speaking only of my own experience here. But I would heavily recommended anyone who's a daily smoker with BPD to force yourself to take a month off, and use that time you would have spent high on looking for other ways you can help yourself without drugs. I guarantee you'll feel an improvement."
BPD,fffinfq,t1_ffer3ne,1579884782.0,"Yes, yes, and yes! Great input and not being able to let go once those perceived emotions kick in is something I think a lot of us struggle with!

And also it's great that you're talking about how ALL types of people handle emotions, without specifically only thinking about it in terms of pwBPD. Opening the conversation up in that way is really beneficial to discussing BPD IMO, and will let us get a better understanding of the specific ways we might struggle and help prevent us from judging out own emotions unfairly."
BPD,fffhyhp,t1_fffbs7d,1579884358.0,"Thank you, that's kind of you to say. I was a little worried about posting that initially as a lot of people have a bias in thinking poor empathy is the same as being a bad person, which is thinking that I am very much prone to myself! My own insights aren't gospel by any means, but unless we can talk about these issues in a non-judgemental way (and for me personally it's not judging myself which is the hardest part) I don't feel like we can start on the path of truly improving our own interpersonal skills.

I'm actually quite out of practise myself. It was being given the opportunity to do an indroductary Mentalization-Based Therapy course that got me started in trying to think about these things in a different way, and I feel lucky in that my brain REALLY fixated on learning the theory behind the treatment. It's very new though so there isn't a lot of information available currently. There is literally only 1 peer reviewed book on the subject so far. 

And thanks for bringing up Marsha Linehan too actually, it's a good reminder that I need to revisit that. I've tried reading her literature before but I wasn't in the best place to be able to try to really understand any of it."
technicallythetruth,fffe3to,t1_ffezdqh,1579881951.0,"Yeah not at all. Fact is that what the majority of animals bred for meat are fed is absolutely disgusting and something no human would consider ""food"". Bulk single grains which do very little good for the animal/meat other than pure calories, usually mixed with waste products from other animals being processed  (definitely not vegan) and a disgusting amount of antibiotics.

OP you should take an unannounced trip to a factory farm sometime. You'll be horrified."
BPD,ffe9pvh,t1_ffe5b74,1579840597.0,"It means ""favourite person"" but it is not a real term, just one heavily used on the Internet. By ""FP"" most people are referring to someone with whom they have an insecure/ambivalent attachment style, rather than a stable one. Our predisposition to having this style of interpersonal relationship with our loved ones probably one of the most difficult parts of having BPD."
BPD,ffe98h2,t1_ffe8wd7,1579840193.0,"Nah, I don't think there is any reason to conflate both those issues. 

Splitting is to do with black and white thinking, while a lack of empathy comes with our inability to correctly empathise with ourselves I think."
BPD,ffe6cz1,t1_ffdxj9h,1579837887.0,"Completely normal. There's this belief that goes around that us with BPD are super empaths.. and I understand why that's a nice thing to think, but it's also completely not true. A lot of people confuse being able to listen and react emotionally with being an empathetic person. 

Don't get me wrong, that's often all a lot of people need which makes us amazing listeners and advise givers in that regard. But let me give an example. Something I see a lot with pwBPD is often times we react emotionally when the person we are listening to isn't actually emotional about their experience themselves, which should be telling that we are not really empathising. What we are GREAT at, is correctly *assuming* how someone feels when listening to them. Our emotional responses are based off OUR experiences and how we can relate (examples: ""I would feel terrible if that happened to me"", ""I would be so scared in the same situation"", ""I'd struggle with that so I understand what you are going through""), which again while this is often great and what a lot of people need, this is not really empathy. This is also why listening to people's problems/stories is often so emotionally draining for us, as when we try to get into the mindset of another person and think about how they must feel, WE are still reacting, not thinking about how the other person is reacting. We're amazing emotional sounding boards for people in that way.

After all we have a disorder characterised by poor interpersonal relationships, which time and time again is due to a failure in understanding the thinking of our partner/friend/family member. We are especially bad at thinking about the results of our own actions which is very basic as far as empathy is concerned. How people can try to relate poor interpersonal skills and amazing empathy is something that confuses me everytime I see it."
Futurology,ffe3ml6,t1_ffe02qk,1579835828.0,"The people claiming that anything other than a small amount cops are unjust murderers are wrong yes. But you're talking like ""oh it's uncommon so that's not how it is"". Even if a police officer murdering someone then getting away free was an exceptionally rare, one or two time occurrence (which is it not, it is much more common), the fact that there are is ""another side of the coin"" means absolutely nothing.

The fact that it can happen at all means the entire system is broken."
BPD,ffdt4hx,t1_ffda08t,1579828263.0,"And thank you too. For sharing your question/thoughts to begin with. Even if it didn't feel like much I think there's a bravery in that. I did look back thinking my post was a little 'me' centric, but it's been so long since I've heard anyone at all talk about that feeling and I think it struck quite a chord with me. It was nice for me to be able to write that down to share with someone who I can be confident in them understanding. 

I hope the best for you. I don't know if it's a feeling we'll ever quite get rid of. But despite what I sometimes tell myself I don't see any rational ways that it should stop us from having a fulfilling life (and perhaps a future family of our own) that I'm sure we both deserve :)"

Trumpspearean_Tweets,ffbr4ip,t3_esjmqh,1579779427.0,"I know scholars often debate this claim, but it is my more scholared opinion that these people are imbiciles. Truly he must have been a man of his time who knew the greatest words. We know from sources dated to that time, that he started with pretty much nothing. After all from the man himself we have:

""Mine own fath'r gaveth me scarce a pennyworth borrow of a millioned pounds.""

So humble were his beginnings. Which I think truly goes to show just how much of a struggle it must have been for him to claim his later success. A true rags to riches story much have been a constant uphill battle. And we can naturally assume only the best words would be befitting such a warrior."
BPD,ff8zux3,t3_esaqzi,1579701214.0,"I get it, I think that way all the time. I DETEST praise, but I take what feels like a sick satisfaction in feeling put down. Like ""HAH f*** you everyone who has ever praised me I knew I was right all along!"".

But honestly, one of the most helpful things I ever had pointed out regarding this by a therapist, is that this is not some weird complex BPD emotion. Or us actually being the worst. Literally all this is, is low self esteem. We just feel it (like everything) more intensely than most people. And we often don't really have the sense of self to be able to know that feeling isn't *actually* us.

And I know it may not sound like it, but that's a really good thing! The exact same self help books/guides/methods that are aimed at low self esteem for the rest of the population work just as well for us! And unlike things targeting BPD specifically there are THOUSANDS of resources available to help tackle this! 

So maybe looking into ways of tackling this specific problem may help? There is no overnight fix but you can start the journey whenever you feel able. And its not something you can 'fail' at, every setback is just us tackling it at our own pace and that's fine. 

But if that's not your thing that's cool. At the very least though, please try keep your head held as high as you can, metaphorically of course. Please try to tell yourself you do deserve praise. Even if it's just a tiny amount, for one minute a day. Because every time you do it makes the next attempt a little bit easier."
