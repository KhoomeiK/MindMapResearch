I'm not sure I could ever prove an attribution of action towards masculine.

My own thoughts are that we have both these energies inside us in varying compositions person to person, at different stages in life as well. We act upon them in our own ways.

To say woman is the submissive, I think is wrong. It may be that the feminine energy is when one takes on more of a surrendered role. Even the surrendered will experience and act upon a boundary at some point. This may be masculine.

These are binary terms, I'm not saying it's worth thinking about, but I'm not sure it matters much, as you have both energies inside of you by design.

To assume anyone would get mass wealth without conditioning under a certain degree of what's established, I think is naive. You would essentially have to completely overthrow and seize, or your own entity would have to become powerful beyond their ability to manage. So long as all of this is spread through law and politics, you likely won't get too far out of pocket. In which case, deals get made, and yes, you ""sell your soul"" which is really just saying you join a certain group and align yourself with their ideology, as it's the primary ideology that's allowed to permeate the culture.

Alexithymia,fi8pgk1,t1_fi8gfp0,1582245378.0,"Were you diagnosed? If so, at what age?

Was there a period in life where your Alexithymia was more pronounced than others?

Do you think things like music and creativity helped you to emotionally attune more?

Do you find your morality to be more principally/dutifully constructed?

What is your visual processing like?

Do you ever find yourself daydreaming or imagining events?

Is there anything particular of note about your dreams? Could you describe any patterns you notice?

I read another AMA by a guy with Alexithymia, and it seemed he also searched out music with meaning and ""soul"" about it. Pieces that would move him. It seems like a search for the emotions as opposed to an indulgence in say the mathematical aspects. Do you enjoy classical? What are your thoughts on Tool? Thoughts on Nirvana? Surfer music (as a sound, though the genre gets redundant quickly in my opinion). Thoughts on Jazz? What type of humor do you lean towards?

I find cinema and music can often be ""more life"". A dramatized representation of it that incorporates emotion into the events or the sound in ways that life generally tends not to.

What are your thoughts on surreal and abstract art? Are there any particularly abstract concepts you are interested in? Things that are purely open to interpretation?

I think the body of reading exists the soul of human experience. To understand a shared experience would likely help conjure empathy. Subjective things with enough recognizable pattern and expression to accept as truth to human experience.

It makes sense now that you strive towards making things with a soul as opposed to, as I considered before, indulging in more of a game. I find in life, all things have their antithesis. With ourselves as a frame of reference, I find we gravitate (in some negative or positive manner) towards or around opposites, perhaps for expansion, awareness, balance, or whatever it may be.

The AMA I had read, the guy also seemed to just consume content in abundance. He was 25 but seems extremely cultured, as if he was in his 50s, I was completely amazed. For me, it can be a bit different. There are periods where I am highly objective, and periods where I am highly subjective. I personally believe our objectivity is more based on our frame of reference as humans, and that everything is truly subjective. As I have an interest in the subjective or abstract, and as I am very curious about, and surrender myself to the perspectives of others at times, I can often be very confused, as I see life as a paradox. I can watch the same piece of content at different periods of my life and have a wildly different experience, as if I have just seen something brand new.

It makes a lot of sense that Zelda sticks with you as well. I think Zelda had a big impact on many people in general. The challenging puzzles, the engaging characters and drama, the beautiful visual and audio soundscape. It really had such a great balance to offer.

Just for a frame of reference, I have been very engaged with behavior for over a decade now. Not so much textbook but mostly my own experiences and observations, and I'm simply in wonder of different aspects of people.

So I take it you are likely a very objective person. What's your goal in trying to figure out others? Is it to understand things like trust? Is it a bench-marker to better understand how to organize yourself within group dynamics? 

What's your work ethic like? When you are able to make something more efficient, or you witness a new process or machine that is more efficient, is there any type of sensation you experience? Fulfillment or contentment perhaps? Anything else?

What instruments can you play? What type of music do you prefer? Is music more math to you? What's your experience with music that would be classified as ""very emotional"", is it sort of a registration, or do you get a sense of it? What are your thoughts on psychedelic music, noise music/noise punk, and soul music? Have you ever tried psychedelic drugs? Would you be willing to link me to music you've made that is solely your own creation?

I think if you keep reading, you will get to deeper understandings even if it is more intellectually driven. You might do well creating stories that have riddles or ""who done it"" themes to them, gamifying them if that makes sense.

Have you ever seen any films by Stanley Kubrick? Have you seen Blade Runner? What are your favorite films or TV shows?

I think a lot of times people feel something negative and are just looking for a bad guy to project it onto.

I think whatever system can offer the most liberty in its own way while still maintaining a healthy infrastructure is what's going to get play. To me, the idea is that we move closer towards freedom of action (with obvious respect to not infringing on the rights of others). If one authoritarian body becomes too constricting for the masses, there will come cries for a regime change. Not advocating one way or another, but that just seems to be the way it goes.

I'm inclined to believe in a movement when people are putting in more work than bitching at government and shaming other people's perspectives. Do some actual work for the development (outside anything political) you want to see in the world like Bill Gates did, help your community and those in need, like Bill Gates did, and maybe people will take your cause more seriously.

Or you could just stay useless and call anyone who disagrees with you a fascist, and cry about how ""money men bad""."

Not sure how what I said correlates with your response. Are you trying to corner me in something?

Here it is again, increase your competency=increase your value. If you'd like more detail, increase your competency in sectors that the public has demand. 

If you want to make money, you fulfill demand. If you want to follow your passion, there might not be demand thus there might not be money, so no, aimless work will not make you rich."

You guys live in a fucking economic fairytale."

SandersForPresident,fhv95gq,t1_fhu8d8n,1581894717.0,"So, just out of curiosity, do you only want Chinese and Saudi Arabia billionaires? It'll be a lot easier for them to influence our politics, economy, and laws. Imperialism isn't western exclusive. Lmk what regime and cultural ideology you want playing world police."

If it was a stand-alone pro-China sub, great, no issues. When it exists to spread misinformation, spin facts dishonestly with motive, and undermine at any expense, in any way, I take issue. Internal argument among Americans is one thing, but this is the LITERAL REASON WHY WE BANNED SO MANY ONLINE RUSSIAN MANIPULATORS."

Mental health is a myth, it assumes the right way to be, it's fallacious social construct by design. What exists is a disconnect between individual and environment. Direction is only -one- direction. It's not for nothing, it allows for social action, but it's not absolute, and neither is any of the shit psychology says about how someone is supposed to be or what a disorder is. All you can do is observe behavior between patient and environment and comment on the reaction between the two. People can then choose what they want to do. Find a new environment, change their immediate environment, or condition themselves in a new way to conform to, or experience the environment in a different way that they would currently prefer

Stress management is something else completely."
