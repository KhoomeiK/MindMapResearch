holdmyredbull,flrsd5l,t1_flrr8s7,1585426831.0,"Very difficult. Often requiring several trips in and out. 

If a route 100’ had about 10 bolts, plus an anchor to get back down (standard in a lot of areas, height dependent). That might weigh 10-15 pounds (I’m estimating, and don’t have a scale with me to verify). Add on top of that your personal gear, your ropes, your drill, batteries, water, and snacks... now carry hardware for multiple routes on top of that. We’re taking a 70-100 lb load. 

I will say: most routes ‘these days’ are rap-bolted. Which is to say the hardware is installed on rappel. So you hike/climb to your access point and either haul your gear up or bring it on the hike, then rappel down to install. 

This saves on effort as you are use gravity to go down rather than fighting gravity the whole way up. It also gives you more time and intention to pick an ideal location for gear, test the rock (we tap it with a hammer, and listen to it), make sure it’s in line with the route and ‘out of the way’ or in a convenient place to clip from. 

The days of ground-up bolting aren’t gone, but its rare and often done by those in the cutting edge and fringe of climbing where access/time/resources are limited or legislation dictates ‘no power tools’."

holdmyredbull,flrqhyr,t1_flrp8y0,1585425699.0,"Sabotage has happened, however is by no means common. It used to happen ‘back in the day’ in places and was made infamous between some very prominent climbers of the early years. 

It continues to happen now, but not for the reasons you might think. ‘Sabotage’ as it happens  right now is mostly due to overinflated egos and folks taking the position: “when I climbed it back when dinosaurs roamed, we only had 2 bolts for the whole route” and will chop and ‘retro-bolting’ that alters the ‘original route’ often in the quest for increased safety. 

I have an opinion on this, but generally try and stay out of it as it often becomes a pissing match between ‘safety’ and ‘legacy’, and ultimately sours the community. 

Often you can’t know who put bolts in, and it is up to the individual to choose to climb something or not. You have to be accountable for your own choices, is my personal philosophy."
holdmyredbull,flrpyv6,t1_flrorzy,1585425377.0,"I never said they never fail, if someone above claimed that, they are likely overstating. 

That being said, the correct hardware on the correct environment may last longer than we live, but gear is at best as good/strong as the rock you put it in. 

To answer your other question, older hardware 70s-90s era was steel rather than stainless and often “too small” by contemporary standards. A lot of folks use 3/8”-1/2” diameter bolts these days whereas some older gear is often 1/4” And have rusted beyond the point of even “marginal security”. 

Also, as folks fall on bolts they flex and can expand the holes they’re in over years. Add on top of that potential for water, freeze/thaw cycles, and galvanic corrosion (metal-on-metal electrolysis (my science is off, but look it up)) these things have a working life.

Great question! Let me know if I can answer anything else."
holdmyredbull,flqu628,t1_flqqnfg,1585406273.0,"There are 2 types, they use both. They do not combine epoxy and expansion bolts. 

Drill a hole:
Option one: a “glue in” which uses epoxy. 
Option two: an expansion bolt which takes a wrench (ideally with a torque wrench  so it’s tightened to spec.). 

There is no option three where you use epoxy and an expansion bolt—to do so increases the likelihood of failure. It has been tested.

Edit: can’t find source... I used to work as a professional climbing guide and volunteered in local rebolting efforts: its hard work."

Then ask me: “when was the last time you felt happy?” I can’t answer that. 

Ask me when was the last time I felt angry, and I can tell you, and recall it and be just as angry/sad/disappointed/scared. 

My hope for you is that joy is in there somewhere, even if it’s masked behind many other feelings/memories.

Hitting the ledge sent me into a somersault motion where I was tumbling backwards 2.5 rotations over the 40 foot drop where I struck the very steep hillside with my left ear and shoulder first (I had dirt impacted into my ear), where I proceeded to tumble/roll another 20-30 feet or so before the rope went tight. 

I needed stitches in my shin from a gash I picked up from a sharp rock in my tumble after hitting the ground, and a boot for 6 weeks while my talar process reattached itself.

One of those times where you go “huh, that was lucky/miraculous/crazy/stupid/adventurous/potentially-lethal/silly/dumb/miscalculated/amazing/wild”.
