While in line to get my first ever college ID this girl just chats me up like she’s know me forever. I instantly felt very comfortable!

BPD,forj9pe,t1_forgv3a,1588013172.0,I totally agree. I would be appalled if anyone used my high school years against me. I was a totally different person and totally immature and mean. People grow and change and deserve forgiveness. Everyone deserves to be looked at with a fresh pair of eyes.
BPD,forj25o,t1_fopxou3,1588013072.0,People forget that absolutely everything is a spectrum. Not all people with BPD are satan in the same way that not everyone with autism is fucking rain man. The entire world is grey. Everyone and everything is grey.

BPD,forikd5,t1_fopg6xh,1588012836.0,Id like to echo this sentiment. The internet is full of hot china town garbage. There are real genuine people out there who listen to the voice of reason and follow the rules of compassion. I hope all of you receive the support you need.
BPD,fori92b,t1_for659b,1588012685.0,"There is something about online support. Its like the minute its online, real life logic flys out the window. Online you’re supposed to just drop anyone for anything and never work on a problem. Everything is a breakup or divorce. Online everyone encourages you to be as selfish as possible and a total loner. You’re never allowed to help anyone with anything because “they have to help themselves” as if bring supportive is toxic now. I feel like we are losing our humanity over the internet."
BPD,forhswy,t1_foqjyc6,1588012467.0,"Yeah i agree. I’d also like to add, there is so much armchair diagnosis being constantly thrown around on the Internet too. 

“My girlfriend yelled at me and crossed a boundary”

Response: “that sounds like BPD you better get her in therapy or leave her right now!”

“My boyfriend yelled at me and crossed a boundary”

Response: “he’s obviously a sociopath and an abuser! Better get him in to therapy or leave and just save yourself “

No one can diagnose anyone with a wall of text. You have to personally know someone to even be able to make a judgment and even then it needs to be objective. Thats why you go to the therapist in the first place."
BPD,forgye2,t1_fopyajh,1588012055.0,Its ironic to me because saying “people with BPD will never change” is literally black and white thinking which is the exact thing they’re criticized for. How is someone going to perpetuate the behavior they dislike? Somehow the diagnosis makes it ok/not ok? So strange to me.
BPD,forgq39,t1_fopa1a0,1588011943.0,I feel that compassion has been lost on many people these days. It’s so easy to nit pick anyone for just about anything. We live in a time where forgiveness is looked down upon and you can be “canceled” for something you did even if you learned from mistakes. I feel like most are missing the point when it comes to what it is to be human.

They bring me great joy however, and thats what makes them amazing in my eyes."
BPD,foppqv8,t1_fopjacn,1587968239.0,Its definitely not for everyone. Its an extremely hard job and the mental health field has the highest burn out. You have to be solid and absolutely devoted to helping people. It also requires a level of objectivity beyond the general population. Unfortunately it can lack that same objectivity that it so desperately requires
BPD,foppiph,t1_fopjg7p,1587968047.0,I think I know which one you are referring to and I felt the exact same way. People were sooooooo dismissive and rude I felt it was a total crap shoot. They were completely discredited and treated as a child... they are AN ADULT HUMAN! Its amazing that so many people can ban together and bring someone down solely based on a diagnosis. No one would have said anything if it was based on depression ect.
BPD,fop6afo,t1_foorg52,1587954025.0,"Yeah I read a lot of posts on the (redacted for moderation purposes) certain someone sub and its just awful.

The sub has this general feel: “i was married to satan and she made everything my fault even though I was literally the reincarnation of jesus!” 

Everyone replies with “satan will never change just be satan forever and jesus doesn’t deserve that”

That view is so obviously not accurate. There were two people in a relationship. They are both flawed as people are. They both played a part. (This obviously doesn’t apply to domestic abuse issues) but they just echo these sentiments without considering that there is a spectrum of issues. Not all persons with BPD are going to be abusive and not everything someone does is abuse."
BPD,fop5foi,t1_fool3i1,1587953482.0,"Yes I totally agree that one person cannot be the predictor of another’s behavior just because they have the same diagnosis. I have one friend who has BPD and she is doing her best to work on it and she’s absolutely wonderful. I love her and totally understand her..for that I am very forgiving because she grants me the same forgiveness. My other friend who has BPD completely cut me out of her life for something minor (in my eyes) but I do not hold that against her. I miss her but I know that she’s fighting her own battles. It would be very unfair of my to take what happened in that relationship and apply it to my other relationship just because they share a common diagnosis. Everything that exists should be taken as a person by person basis and diagnosis aside. We all choose what we are willing to put up with in a relationship, the diagnosis shouldn’t be put up, but rather the person as a whole."
BPD,fop2fm1,t1_fooiz1w,1587951595.0,I’m glad I could provide that. Its absolutely fucked that you can’t feel that way all the time. Playing into the stigma will just hinder everyone’s progress
BPD,fop2cdm,t1_fooi076,1587951539.0,Yeah I absolutely agree with you. I really think mental illness in general is a spectrum. Not every sociopath is going to murder and not everyone with BPD is the devil. There are levels and it’s completely unfair to lump everyone together
BPD,fop11jw,t1_foodjra,1587950727.0,"I agree its not always abuse. I think they mean trauma. Divorce would be traumatic enough especially when you’re too young to understand what’s happening. Me personally, i feel any level of traumatic experience as a child will eventually manifest is some way through adulthood. Some of us just manifest it in a way that doesn’t come with a lot of trouble. I think all mental illness comes on a spectrum"

I’ve been uninsured for some time (im luckily insured now) you have to wait so long just to get an appointment, find the right therapist, medical costs ect. Its ridiculous that its not just as easy as a regular doctor. How come there aren’t simple clinics for things like this.

BPD,fooz5vz,t1_foogmcn,1587949570.0,I imagine its harder for men because they are encouraged to hide their feelings and be “strong”.  Its a double edged sword of fucked because 1) stigma on the disorder 2) stigma on the gender
BPD,fooz0ik,t1_foogodp,1587949479.0,That seems so silly to me. How the actual fuck is ADHD (a literal brain structure disorder) forgiven when something like a mood disorder (a totally malleable state) seen as unfixable. Its so weird to me..everything can be fixed in one way or another. Maybe not 100% but at least to a fully functioning state.
BPD,fooyhqk,t1_foo5876,1587949157.0,"Well, we all have a responsibility to work on relationships as a team. If he is aware and has done any research on the issue, he should be willing to play his part. If he’s not, maybe he just isn’t right for you. He should be willing to set boundaries and also be introspective on his own behavior.

All that being said, no relationships exist without emotional turbulence. Its just what happens when you’re with a person."
BPD,fooxrss,t1_foos97a,1587948717.0,Don’t ever let these people’s opinions hold you down. You are more than that. Everyone can change. I grew up thinking I’d never be able to be good at math. With the little bit of help I’ve had for my ADHD (non medicated even)  I’ve gotten A’s in all my college level math. Everyone has a maleable brain and it can be rewired!
BPD,fooxhjk,t1_fookx1a,1587948539.0,"And to say its impossible is just false. I worked with a man that lost all of his schizophrenic symptoms through meds and therapy. That’s something I heard could never happen but there he was, a fully functioning member of society, working the same position as me. 

My anxiety is 99% gone and I never even attended therapy for it. Just a couple years of SSRIs was enough to help me that much! Never lose hope because anything can be overcome, maybe not 100% but enough to no longer fit into diagnostic criteria !"
BPD,foox42h,t1_foo0m1q,1587948313.0,Thank you for thinking that! I’m just trying to be understanding because we all have strifes and shouldn’t be judged for what specific type it is.
BPD,foow77x,t1_fooikpj,1587947764.0,"I’ve also heard that many therapists and psychiatrists have been taught to only take on one BPD patient at a time because It can be “taxing”. Even the mental health professionals stigmatize it. Another bad part is medical professionals themselves are stigmatized. A single episode of mental illness for a provider can be career ending and that’s why suicide rates are so high among higher tier medical professionals. Its quite sad and we have a very long way to go still. Attitudes are changing though, in all my psychology classes in the last few years, the teachers took a very strong stance on judging people based on what you think “normal” is. Quoting my abnormal psych teacher “the DSM5 was written by middle age white men in Minnesota. What is abnormal for them may not be for a native person in the backwoods of Alaska. Disorders need not be disorders if they’re not causing problems”"

BPD,fonx9vx,t1_fonvuob,1587928284.0,"I accidentally got diagnosed as an adult. My family did not believe in mental illness when I was growing up so I thought I was just lazy and dumb. I then worked for a lady who tutored kids with adhd, autism and dyslexia. She told me she strongly suspected that I have adhd so I went through the process from there. Its not always easy but finding the right provider (someone who specializes in ADHD) is essential. Sometimes is not always ADHD though because the symptoms overlap with a number of other disorders (autism, bpd, ect)"
BPD,fonvjdb,t3_g8j0g1,1587927300.0,"There is never any harm in getting a second opinion on anything. If you’re feeling insecure or hopeless check with another therapist. Doctors, therapists ect.

scoliosis,fom2gcg,t3_g87wk0,1587876488.0,"Any and all workouts. Im not a medical professional but I have severe scoliosis that was never surgically corrected. I’ve been working out doing various types of weightlifting and yoga + pole fitness for about give years. The difference is incredible. My body definitely evened out and the pain sort of just disappeared over time. Now that we are in quarantine I haven’t worked out in a month and my pain came back full force. I can even visibly see my shoulder coming forward more. I can only tell you from anecdotal personal experience, but exercise is the only thing keeping me mobile and healthy. 

My recommendation would be, do side planks and exercises on the weak side twice as much as the strong side. When I do yoga I stretch towards the curve twice as much as away. Its helped a ton! I hope this helps"

I was absolutely wrong , there is only a small number of augmented women in my city! It absolutely put my self esteem through the roof. People constantly complimented my body and tell me that I’m perfect as is. In five years I’ve probably gotten 5 negative comments. After constantly seeing so many different body types daily, I’ve learned to appreciate what I have because its what makes us unique that is beautiful.

MedicalGore,fnc1hvp,t1_fnc0hh3,1586826648.0,Im so sorry you have to deal with that bullshit. It seems like different doctors have very different opinions on what to do. My cousin had lower scoliosis and only 30 degrees of curvature and they gave her surgery right away without ever even trying the brace because the doctor believed it doesn’t work. That was 13 years ago and she still has pain and to this day we all wonder if either of us got what we needed because neither of us got second opinions. We were young and had no control.

He said he’d break up with me over that, but somehow he rationalized that this is ok. I don’t get it.

BPDSOFFA,fn0uhc6,t3_fyll1g,1586548976.0,Ok so you’ve been dating for less than a year and half the time has sucked? May I ask what exactly is keeping you in this relationship at all?
Botchedsurgeries,fmwu0u4,t1_fmwsxzd,1586453020.0,There are more risks than just that. Its estimated that 1/3 of breast implant patients develop autoimmune disorders. Women with implants are also three times more likely to commit suicide. Even mastectomy patients with implants are three times more likely to commit suicide than non implanted mastectomy patients
Botchedsurgeries,fmwtmni,t1_fmwc4jg,1586452821.0,Obviously not. Its called an elective surgery for a reason.
smallbooblove,fmwrabg,t1_fmvsuoh,1586451634.0,"I mean yeah im sure they do manufacturing in china just like most things that are available in America. I find it weird that this specifically is getting so much attention. 

Has anyone ever eaten anything from nestle, Hershey, mars, kraft, Cadbury, or kit kat? Has anyone shopped at H&M, forever 21, victorias secret, GAP, Nike urban outfitters, adidas, walmart, Aeropostale?  How about bought apple products, Disney or toys r us products? 

Every single one of those brands has been involved in child labor. Some doubled down and use prison labor as well. 99.99% of Americans have been supporting child labor and im sure most people are unaware."
BPDSOFFA,fmv6ng0,t3_fnkthy,1586407490.0,I could see that. The general vibe if that sub seems to be “people with BPD will never change and are always bad people. You will never have a good relationship with them” and that is simply untrue and way to absolute to apply to reality. I have a few friends with BPD and they’re wonderful people. They’re aware of their problems and do their best to correct their problems. Its seems to me that no one there thinks they did anything wrong at all (that’s impossible for a human being). They never want to take responsibility and only point fingers (most of the time). That does sort of fit the narcissist profile. Is it all of them? No but I’m sure there is more than a handful
unpopularopinion,fmuif9q,t1_fmu2zu8,1586392028.0,You forgot to mention the part about them being on anime girls
unpopularopinion,fmuicgv,t1_fmu62kn,1586391985.0,Only on an anime girl
PewdiepieSubmissions,fmuh44o,t1_fmqvpmz,1586391296.0,I am 100% vegan I do not consume any animal products or use anything tested on animals ect..im just not against honey. I think bee keepers are more important than ever and the harm aspect just isn’t there. Im a moral vegan so the harm is all i really care about.
smallbooblove,fmtrejz,t1_fmtpy69,1586377698.0,I’m personally more concerned about weather or not companies use prison/child labor/ animal products. If one wishes to avoid dolls kill you could shop directly from the brands they feature.
smallbooblove,fmtqm99,t1_fmtoykw,1586377306.0,None taken! I totally understand people’s desire to shop ethically!
smallbooblove,fmtmuzv,t1_fmtjfrs,1586375452.0,The only thing I’ve heard is that they’re anti sex worker. As a dancer myself I do not care. Plenty of dancers wear victorias secret and they do not represent or associate with our community and also use prison labor. Im not sure what other accusations dolls kill has faced and I will continue to buy their stuff unless something really horrible comes to light.
smallbooblove,fmtie6a,t3_fux8ey,1586373250.0,They’re a lovely shape and probably twice what I have! I’d say they’re medium size for sure!
