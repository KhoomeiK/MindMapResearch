SuicideWatch,fplzw9d,t1_fplzc0p,1588722723.0,"What does your therapist think? I've often felt frustrated with some of my own trauma and the lack of progress. It can feel like I haven't made much. But I can usually find something small even if it's just a change in coping. Like, not self harming anymore (for example). 

I don't know if you've told your therapist much about the success of your abusers upsetting you, but I definitely recommend staying away from your abusers' social media - I.e. don't go looking at their success and their life as much as you want to."
SuicideWatch,fplz90l,t1_fplymg0,1588722361.0,I know it sounds clich√© but it's the only thing I can think of to say (I hate when people say it to me but it's true) is that time does help. It sounds like it's going to be a very long and painful road. Progress can be slow. But with time and therapy you are building yourself back up and getting good help that will stand to you. Well done for getting that help.
depression,fplyukq,t3_ge8ova,1588722135.0,"Yeah totally. I have to say I can do this too but I try not to. I've known people who have been to psych wards, and they felt that I wasn't ""really"" depressed because I have a job and a partner. But I really really am. And then sometimes I catch myself judging other people who have lots of friends and go out a lot, because my snap judgement is ""but they have everything going for them"". But people feel how they feel. Some are just functioning better or differently."
SuicideWatch,fplxlf0,t3_ge5qxh,1588721426.0,"You are not worthless. Can you imagines saying those things to someone else? I hope not. I wouldn't. Decent people don't say that to someone. That comment is a reflection on them, not you. Those are terrible things and nobody should ever ever say them. *Hug*. Go and talk to a friend or family. People who like and care for you."
SuicideWatch,fplwru9,t3_ge6cdu,1588720966.0,"I'm not sure of the context and details here, but I think we can all relate to someone being abusive or nasty and yet also being more happy and successful than you are at that moment. *Hug*. It's a really shitty feeling.

The only advice I can give - focus on yourself and your own happiness and success. You could waste a lot of time letting this make you into a bitter person waiting on them to get their comeuppance or waiting for closure. It might not come. Think about how you can take care of yourself and accept what has happened. Go to counseling so you can get some perspective on this and try to fill your life with good things. Do not let them win by sitting and ruminating about this forever."
SuicideWatch,fplw6xu,t3_ge25rl,1588720647.0,"I have mixed feelings on your point, the mixed bit being the part where you say ""stop being cruel to people"" by calling them toxic (maybe I'm misunderstanding that bit, clarify if that is the case). I don't think there's anything cruel about calling out someone's behaviour and avoiding someone if they are ""toxic"". 

That said, I'm a little hazy on what counts as toxic. I think it can be thrown around by people writing others off as you say."

I just want to zoom them since ramadan starts Friday and thought reading a story would be a nice easy way of starting zoom conferences. I want to ask them questions along the way, like how they are helping out at home (helping being a big theme of the book and ramadan from what I gather). I'm not even sure if all of them will be fasting. I hear it varies. I just want to provide something meaningful to them."

The story is all about helping others. If I were to ask children at the end of the story ""how could you help others at home during this time?"" Would that be appropriate? I'm unsure if helping others is the central purpose of ramadan or if it's just incidental in this story"
islam,fo6k2vt,t1_fo6jokx,1587560760.0,"Thank you :) 

In the story the main character is a girl, and she's opening a calendar door every day for Ramadan. In the story, the message on the last day is to help others. Is a calendar with doors (like an advent calendar leading up to Christmas) common? I've never seen it before myself."

I don't know how they called you out at the bar job but I would think that they should have build you up instead of criticising you, especially so early in. A bar job is very very sociable.
