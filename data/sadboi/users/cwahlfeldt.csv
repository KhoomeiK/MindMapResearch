ADHD,fq1f284,t1_fpvr8f1,1589045080.0,"Sorry for the late response.

There‚Äôs a part of me that does regret it but at the same time I love him to death! Idk it‚Äôs hard to explain and I‚Äôm still figuring out how to be a parent but I don‚Äôt think I could live without him now. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs hard to have you‚Äôre partner not wanting kids and you do. Maybe give it more time. If you really love this person though you will need to respect there choices as well."
ADHD,fpvmfit,t1_fpur5sh,1588947695.0,"Totally. The responsibility is crushing me. I don‚Äôt really have time for myself and my dreams anymore. I feel like I‚Äôve lost sight of myself while trying to please my family and now I‚Äôm so depressed. I don‚Äôt have any close friends anymore. I miss being 20, getting fucked up with my friends, and dreaming about all the things I would grow to be. Worst of all is that idk if I want to be married to my wife anymore and I feel horrible for even thinking it.

This really sounds like a midlife crisis, but maybe it has to do with my adhd raddled brain.

I do hope you get what you want though and don‚Äôt let me discourage you on whatever path you want to take."

AvPD,fmm0vsl,t3_fw2yal,1586196722.0,"I feel the same way. Its something I haven't always felt but has been really bad this last year. I was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and took medication. The meds worked for a little while but they started making me feel crazy and super anxious. When i first started taking them, they worked and made me feel confidant and intelligent but that went away after a few months. Ultimately I had to quit taking stimulants because they were messing with me but I really want to feel the way i did when i originally took them again... IDK maybe check into ADHD?"

I‚Äôm in therapy but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help me much. Hit me up if you ever wanna chat about it or need a friend cause I definitely need one as well. Cheers!

Keep trying to tell yourself that you are worthy because its 100% true, and don't let your mind or anyone else tell you otherwise. Ive been going through some mental health issues combined with the medication I take, and I can sympathize with you for sure.

In my case, I never want to be a burden to my friends and family by pouring out my problems to them. But I'm coming to find out, that's why you have friends and family and you will never be a burden to the people that truly love and care for you.

p.s. --  When I'm feeling shitty I listen to 2pac... I know that sounds kinda weird but he can be very relatable when it comes to mental health. Here's a playlist with some of my fav songs by him [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0uy5ic5q9fwVFILu5mZKdA?si=ozMdnmONQ2e8xoddXZOsIQ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0uy5ic5q9fwVFILu5mZKdA?si=ozMdnmONQ2e8xoddXZOsIQ).

Fuckthealtright,ev631mw,t1_ev5ycru,1564241914.0,"I think when talking about government positions we shouldn‚Äôt just like a persons passion,  admiration for their job and the process. We should also look at when a ‚Äùhealthy‚Äù human being can still make appropriate  decisions without bias.  Also we should be able to view this person without bias either because they are supposed to represent us, the populace, right? Answer that question and really think if politicians, lawyers, capitalists, and lobbyists really give a fuck about their constituents in any meaningful way that doesn‚Äôt benefit themselves...

I‚Äôm ranting...

But I‚Äôm also not saying muller is/isn‚Äôt biased towards a party, but he‚Äôs old and had too many court cases for his ass to not be biased towards something right? The process obviously doesnt work anymore and any older person that believes in democracy, the constitution, respect, ethics and morality is fucking fooling themselves when they think the world is gonna be an ok place for their children, using the current ‚Äúsystem‚Äù we have in place. 

Why do we expect people doing their jobs to do the job you want them to do? That‚Äôs about as American as apple pie. muller is too stressed and too fucking old to be making decisions that will affect millions of people.... and that goes for literally all politicians and people that don‚Äôt give a shit about the world right now because hey nihilism is great but a lot of people are just in denial.


... Edit

Hate us cause they aint us! Look im not trying to be an ageist asshole here but, can we agree that new politicians and literal government employees could be a good thing?

The carb on the 69s didn‚Äôt have a float so you gotta give it tons of gas before you cold kick it. I Also really want a magneto on it but those things are soooo pricey!

Humans can go fuck themselves when it comes to this issue because it‚Äôs our fault and responsibility to protect and make sure dogs don‚Äôt live and grow up in the streets... buuut we can‚Äôt even do that when our own people are going through similar struggles, but at least they having backing of a ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù unlike most animals.
