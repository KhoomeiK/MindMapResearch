I could look at my parents and watch how they moved and listen to the tone and volume of their voices and it felt like watching the sky for tornadoes.  

Our safe places were the bathroom and the closet.  I barely remember this, but I would grab my little sister and I would put her in a hamper, cover her with clothes, and I would go to the back of the closet and sit on top of the shoes with my back against the wall and hide behind the hanging clothes.  My sister has some memories of this too.   Or I would put her on my lap and cover her ears.  

By the way, no one ever came to check on us or tell us it was okay, we just came out when things quieted down.

Anyway, whenever I get re-traumatized in any way, I clear out my closet, put blankets and pillows in and get in and shut the door.   I feel sooooo safe there.  One of my friends told me she does this too.  Sometimes I used to think I was crazy to do this.  I explained it to my husband and he completely understands.  This year I have had 9 months of really good trauma therapy and I feel soooo much better.

My momma runs this family,you could say ""she wears the pants,""She holds the reins quite happily,and delights in this sinister dance.

I am her broken china doll,with cracks and glue drips on my face.Two years ago a pretty bad fall,removed me from my state of grace.

She's got three more, in better shape,to display in the cabinet front.

There's a boy with a golden cape,with a crown of jewels and a scepter blunt.Her critical eye we cannot escape,and harsh treatment, dare we break the rules.

She's got another girl, in pretty good repair,Lucky for that doll, her damage is hidden.So, for this one, she takes good care,for to show imperfection is strictly forbidden.

There's another boy, he looks just fine,He has no jewels, but needs none.His damage is on the inside, unlike mine."

CPTSD,ffsjxjs,t3_euyfh4,1580183539.0,"I am so sorry you are going through this.  I finally had to come to terms with the fact that my mother was never a mother to me at all.   I realized that I never really had a mother, and I never felt safe in my home from the time I was 2 yrs to the time I moved out at 18 yrs.   The woman I call Alice, not mother, took sadistic pleasure in abusing me.   The reality of never having had a mother has been a very bitter pill, but once I took it, and went through many stages  of grief, things started to get better.   You are not alone, I wish you healing on this journey."

narcissisticparents,ffn115f,t3_eu1gkm,1580060891.0,"Wow, it sounds like gaslighting, trying to convince you that you are gay.  Weird.   My nmom used to imply things like this when I was younger because I dressed like a tomboy.  She would always say, ""Do you have something to tell me?"" in a weird way, and I knew what she meant.  I support LGBTQ people, and I have no problem with them.  When I was in college, I got asked out by men and women and I was only sexually interested in the men.  I wonder what she thinks now because I am in a very happy marriage with a man for the last 23 years.  I guess I'm not gay.  Or maybe she thinks I am in the closet?!  lol   I am also NC with her for many other reasons."

NarcissisticAbuse,ffiiori,t3_etjpbs,1579974800.0,"Thank you, this is helpful.  I sometimes feel toxic guilt and shame over going NC.  The N's in my life are my mother, stepfather, and two brothers.  It's really hard sometimes, but I know it's better for me to stay NC.  This is a good reminder of why I went NC."
