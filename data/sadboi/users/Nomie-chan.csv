Just because I wanna curl into a ball and die when I wash my hands doesn't mean I'll react the same when my hands encounter something like a suuuuper soft blanket. Both are strong touch related stimuli, but one is positive and another is negative.

Even things that are similar can carry different reactions. Loud sounds tend to be overwhelming for a lot of us, but certain TYPES of loud sounds are reacted to differently depending on the person. I love the roar of a plane engine, or the loud hum of a bus. I enjoy being at rock concerts, but if someone drives past me on the road with their bass all the way up and no other actual music is audible? GTFO that hurts my bones!

I feel that there's a tendency for everyone (animals included) to gravitate toward their positive sensory stimuli and veer away from the negative sensory stimuli. It's just a matter of nature, whether you're autistic or not."

Me and one other group member did fine. The third one...derailed entirely. 

She was a social worker and single mom some 10+ years older than the rest of the class who decided that her section of the project was better spent talking about movie piracy and why it should be decriminalized. Complete with irrelevant slides showing Captain Jack Sparrow and personal tie-ins to her weekly pirated movie nights with her kids. She had not run ANY of this by me and the other group member so we were both stuck up there with her as she monologued, looking to us for nods of approval while we subsequently died inside. I've never seen an entire room cringe THAT hard through a presentation before. 

The worst part was that she was the second speaker in the group, and my section of the project (which was 100% on topic) was last. So I had to basically do damage control. How FUN."

RiceCookerRecipes,fn22879,t3_fyvahr,1586575921.0,"Hey there! The answer to your problem could be a few things. I own a Tiger JNP-1800 and I encounter some similar issues every so often. Mine is more simplistic as it just has one switch that goes between ""cooking"" and ""keep warm"". There is no option to keep the heating element off. For me, once it ""pops"" I usually unplug it as the ""keep warm"" setting tends to burn the rice. Is it possible yours does the same, or is programmed to stay on ""keep warm"" after the rice is cooked? If so find a way to turn it off, if possible. 

Additionally, parboiled rice shouldn't typically be used in rice cooker recipes as it's already partially cooked and takes less time. Most Japanese rice cookers are designed with white rice in mind, as that's the staple default type found in Japanese households. As such, the rice your using may need less time than the rice cooker thinks, leading it to getting burnt.

If all else fails and you still get a layer of ""crispy rice"" stuck to the bottom, don't worry! This is common, and there are actually Japanese recipes on how to use this to make a snack or meal. Hopefully my advice helps!"
