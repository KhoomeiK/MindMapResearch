This year I took up an AP class and have finished with a cumulative of over 3.75 which was what was required for the honors college at a state university (because it had great prices even though its individual colleges are hella good and I‚Äôm going into the Virtual Communication and Design program which has a big success rate and the open house had professors bragging about the book covers graduates are getting. Good news was I was accepted! 3k/30k+ get in to the honors college which is great because it gives me an edge on signing up for classes. I was on the edge of the whole thing for a while but I finished this last quarter with a 4.5 (extra 0.5 due to AP class) which has determined I won‚Äôt get booted.

Oh and then two weeks late my great grandmother died. I would break down sobbing at school so bad they had to send me home. This was a month of school I missed from that. In March of junior year the man who literally drove everything I aspired to dropped dead while jogging. I love photography and it is because of him and he is dead. My grandmother is dead, the woman who raised me when my parents were at work was gone all the sudden, she died the literal day we put my great grandmother in hospice care and I dealt with guilt throughout the whole time after her death because I asked to go see my grandmother because my grandmother just put her own mother in hospice care. My parents said it was fine and I took that. She died from a heart attack and since that day I was convinced that I couldn‚Äôt saved her if I was there. I was traumatized by the sheer description of her being sprawled out on the floor by my great uncle. I was so attached to this woman that I have STILL had to stay out of class because I couldn‚Äôt speak I was sobbing so hard even during senior year. My dad wasn‚Äôt very expressive and couldn‚Äôt understand so he got frustrated at how I couldn‚Äôt focus at school due to her death so I held it in and made it worse. But do go on."

Also if you‚Äôve had a 2.0 then that‚Äôs not really my problem. You‚Äôre just going to have to try community college. But stop acting like seniors are ruining your chances to get into college because they do the rather common leap year that thousands of kids already do. Like what do you want? Them to force themselves to go to college when they‚Äôve been stressed the hell out? When people in their families have died? The only reason I MYSELF am not taking a leap year is because if I‚Äôm not busy I will be in a mentally critical condition. Maybe stop thinking of yourself having trouble getting into college because you have a 2.0 and now more competition. You already had slim chances but maybe if you‚Äôre lucky you can get a 2.5.

I wear pads meant for sleeping to get through school days usually because they absorb so much, and I hate using the school bathrooms."
AskReddit,fpkeigv,t1_fpkdzsv,1588693226.0,"Oh yeah I asked about small fees and sometimes my boss just let me delete them anyways, though I still wonder about the fees of $300. The ones of less than a dollar or a few dollars made more sense"
AskReddit,fpkc5wz,t1_fpkbqmi,1588691993.0,I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs awful.
AskReddit,fpkc0u2,t1_fpkajh4,1588691918.0,"Oh that wasn‚Äôt my job! I sat at a computer behind the main desk out of view and deleted the accounts with no outstanding fees or books that were still out or missing. The ones with fees or that had books checked out would be dealt with by my boss. Long process though, since some of the books came from a library across the US or something, it could be a missing book from that library and would take a while to resolve. But no I don‚Äôt think they tried to reclaim books yet. I mean again there were people in there that passed in the 70s or something that had huge fees that they would probably deal with first but again, it wasn‚Äôt my job so I just deleted the accounts and left the rest like I was told. Solid job though, my boss was wonderful and warned me about the fact it was kind of morbid."
AskReddit,fpkbmj1,t1_fpkb8de,1588691706.0,Yeah I think so. I only went through and deleted the accounts though. My boss would handle the rest.
AskReddit,fpkbj3b,t1_fpk9pkd,1588691655.0,I left it and told my boss. This was literally my first job less than a year ago. She would take over from there.
AskReddit,fpkakki,t1_fpk5kwb,1588691143.0,"What kind of crazy person won‚Äôt change sanitary supplies when it‚Äôs all free?! Through middle school and even though it‚Äôs over, in less than two weeks, high school girls would openly ask if somebody had a pad or tampon they could use because they needed it. It‚Äôs not that hard!"
AskReddit,fpk9ck0,t1_fpk79h9,1588690484.0,"Not Human Resources but my first job was for a circulation desk in the library my mother works at, since she works there she was able to get me the job. One of the pieces of work I had to do was delete deceased clients from the system. I had to look up all these names and check if they had any outstanding fees or books that needed returned, and if they didn‚Äôt then I would delete them from the system. The system hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in a while, because there were accounts that hadn‚Äôt been active since the 70s, but there were also accounts that were used just a week ago, all of which had the owner pass away. I tried to just do the work and not think about the morbidity but it was odd."
todayilearned,fpk74bu,t1_fpjhven,1588689273.0,"I would be okay with mosquitos, but as stated in my post I have a large allergic reaction. The bits swell up the the size of half a dollar, and no not a half dollar, I mean half a paper dollar. They get so hot It hurts my fingers to touch them and I have to take Benadryl and everything constantly to manage the itching symptoms, the heat, and to help the swelling go down. If I do nothing like most people it could stay swollen and that‚Äôs just not good. Trust me, I would rather have biting midges than me stuck with a bandage around a bite to stop me from scratching it as my mother debates taking me to the hospital because of how long I‚Äôve had the bite without any symptoms getting better. I am also for some reason desirable to mosquitos so I get bitten a whole lot. If I wear bug spray I somehow still end up with bites and have even looked into getting a mosquito net to sit in when outside because of it. If it weren‚Äôt bad enough sometimes I get bites right next to each other meaning it swells even larger. Bites are not easily manageable for me and have sometimes made my vacations unbearably worse because I‚Äôm stuck with giant bumps all over me and realize there‚Äôs no way in hell im doing more outside activities when I have enough bites already."

Unless you‚Äôre in a big city, Americans generally smile, wave, and greet people during their day, even if the people are strangers. Just thought I would mention it because I see so many stories about people being confused, weirded, or freaked out by it!"
AskAnAmerican,fpja81z,t3_gdltbe,1588661389.0,Got a Passport card long ago because I visit my aunt in Canada with my mom and dad. No need for a paper passport book when I never fly on a plane and only go to Canada.
