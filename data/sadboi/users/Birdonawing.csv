I water mine by sticking them in an barrel of water getting them good and soaked and then letting them drain. You could do this in a sink or any container. I don't feed them much i just put some general fertiliser in the barrel. Its a beautiful plant . Good luck"

I completed my last degree in my late 50's and will probably do more study so don't think it's over when you  walk off that stage.

It's a journey ( Cliche I know!) I never really knew what I wanted I just used what was available I wasn't lucky enough, smart enough or rich enough to be to picky all I was,was determined and willing to have a go and it worked out OK with a few bumps along the way."

I wasn't really thinking about a job in McDonald's or such but maybe I am being a bit naive. I was thinking about something that would give people a challenge ,an experience in what they might like to do. Maybe a system of paid work experience.

The point I was trying to make (poorly!) was that people would have a idea of what life might be like without having a trade or a degree and it might encourage them to push on when the going gets tough."
NoStupidQuestions,fi1zwkh,t3_f605kd,1582068330.0,"Some good points made so far, thanks. 

I think the most important one is that doing this would impede people getting a higher education, it would certainly impede them starting.  

But would it reduce drop out rates ( because students are mor mature)which are very high all around the world and therefore increase the number of people achieving a degree ?

College/university fees, lack of child care, shortage of accommodation and a number of other things are also a barrier to education. Mostly effecting the middle and working class's.

If you combined supports in these areas and being a more mature student I think you could get a great result for society overall."
