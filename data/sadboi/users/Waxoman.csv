Cuz what no one at fucking twitch or just ANYWHERE understands is free speech exists for a reason

Even if people are saying crazy or horrible shit you have to allow them to say it. It’s just there’s gonna be a ton of people opposing them which will show itself in negative consequences for them.

But the best way to actually stop people from thinking “bad” thoughts is through dialogue.

And I feel Sliker has been a really good example of this with all the incel shit. Me personally, I feel these thots deserve to be treated with no respect because they don’t treat themselves with any respect. However, I do feel not all women fall into this category, and it’s wrong to then treat people who’ve done nothing wrong worse than you.

And I feel Sliker came to this realization himself.

However, I do find the fact he needs to reign himself in when taking about these twitch thots and just the platform in general reprehensible. He should be allowed to say what he thinks, what is true, and not be blackballed just because it doesn’t go with the current SJW narrative."
