TrueChristian,eyj9sez,t1_eyj6ai6,1567114904.0,"Amen! I agree with you. There were other gift offerings to God that required sacrifices that did not have anything to do with sin and atonement.

It makes me sad when I see us all fighting over who has the truth. The bible warns us about divisions and spiritual warfare. It shows more and more when we show unloving attitudes to each other and exchange harsh words.

I noticed your flair says ""Nazarene"". Do they teach what you have spoken about to the other brother/sister or did God just reveal it to you through personal research?

The sacrifices continuing that you speak about I learned from a Messianic Jewish Professor who pointed out that the bible does support sacrifices in the new kingdom.

I hope you have a good day!"

I guess culturally I like people who live a certain way. It's more of a Barack Obama vs Flavor Flave sort of thing. It's not a black vs white thing. I am not interested in anyone who might be getting in trouble with the law. I live in NYC where some people aren't doing the right things. There is a lot of drugs and shooting in my neighborhood, so I do screen out possible trouble makers (and this includes whites. There are white men out here hanging on the corner selling dope too, but they usually don't try to pick up women (at least not me).

I also wasn't joking. The men who have approached me in my neighborhood have straight up looked me up and down and asked me when was the last time I had sex. Asked me if I want to go spend time at my place etc after only asking me for my number at a grocery store. One man from Ghana asked me about my credit score and kept trying to establish a relationship right away.

This isn't about minority vs non minority. This is about not wanting to date people that don't fit what I am looking for. If he's respectful and tries to establish a normal relationship before asking to come home with me or about my credit or sex life, then I have no problem with him regardless of race.

The point of my post was just to get another understanding of the scriptures I mentioned to see how the Jewish community understands these from a Jewish perspective.

The commenter above wrote something that appears like there are two different sets of rules for men and women. Since God is not partial, this seemed odd. I was seeking more clarity on what they commented specifically to me.

I'm sorry if you are annoyed by my question. I was just trying to see if what I am being told using the bible is correct (since you know people can use scripture any way they want to make a law that God himself was not making).

TrueChristian,exzelv4,t3_cuqm6v,1566664884.0,"<""She thinks that a person dying on a cross isn‘t a „nice“ and positive symbol."">

(Sorry. I still don't know how to accurately capture quotes on reddit)


Yes, dying on a cross isn't ""nice"", but that is the whole point. What Jesus suffered for mankind wasn't nice at all. It was unjust and brutal and yet it served a purpose.

For some people, when they see this symbol it reminds them of the ugly and brutal death that should have been theirs as sinners. It reminds them what this man (God incarnate) Jesus of Nazareth did for our sake. For some, this symbol is the reason they remember to pray everyday, to read their bibles everyday, and to be grateful for the lives they can live now. They have peace with God and need not fear as they put faith in knowing God has redeemed them. For some, this negative symbol has become a positive symbol of hope.

We don't worship it or feel it has magic powers or anything of the sort. It just serves as a reminder sort of how God's rainbow was a sign or symbol of peace from destruction from flood waters. Like the ""mark"" on Cain served as a sign or symbol of protection.

I hope your girlfriend can be persuaded to see the other side of the story why this symbol might be important for many christians (though there are some who also share her view too and that is fine. It is a conscience matter).

I hope you have a good day!"

TrueChristian,ewot689,t3_cpc1v9,1565626098.0,"I understand your sentiments. Living a life of faith sometimes leaves us lonely. I have family that also do not receive the word of God and to make matters worse, they refuse to even hear it.

I have made friends within the church so that has been a blessing. At times though, even with church friends I find myself alone (people tend to be distant and preoccupied in general).

Keep praying for your friends and family. Also, whenever you feel lonely you can always come here. We are a large spiritual family (despite differences in doctrine). I am always available to talk (most days) and I check reddit at least once a day.

I pray that God gives you his blessing and helps you with your loneliness. I pray he brings friends into your life. I pray he softens the hearts of your current friends and your family.

Remember, the word of God is foolishness to the world. Those who cannot or do not believe will always think we are crazy. One day Jesus will make all very clear to them, but until then we continue to pray for them and do good to them.
