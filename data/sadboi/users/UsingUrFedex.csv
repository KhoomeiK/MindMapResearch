hiphopheads,eowbiso,t1_eowaj3i,1558907619.0,"Imagine being 40 and being this ignorant, imagine being 40 and talking down on a man who can't defend himself due to his unfortunate death. Imagine going your whole life acting this way and then expecting people to actually agree with your ignorant comments. The only reason anyone here is responding right now is due to you trying to legit talk down on a dead man who's done more for his community than you have ever or will ever do your entire life. I would say I hope you grow up but if you're 40 still saying this sort of stuff I'm pretty sure I won't hold my breath. You're a coward for insulting a dead man who can't defend himself and everyone here knows that."

hiphopheads,eow0g5x,t1_eovtty6,1558903380.0,The thing is you're a 40 year old tweaker who's always taken the safe route his entire life and where has that got you? Here bashing a man who has a huge legacy behind him and was half your age doing more than you will ever do in your lifetime. Hes remembered all over the world who are you? When you die no one will care and its because you did nothing your entire life but bashed others taking risks dumb or not to get where they needed to be. Your post history says a lot lmao no one's paying you any mind either on reddit or the real world which is why you need to give these sorts of comments. Rip nipsey
