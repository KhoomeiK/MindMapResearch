he used weilin's work as a reference and tribute; that is why it isnt exactly the same"

Maplestory,esizmre,t1_esiyfr9,1562023242.0,"yeah man when i joined back i joined reboot haha
  
hopefully you already know that you cant trade and all that
  
it's a bit more difficult than regular worlds but my friends and i think that struggling makes things more fun lol because you have to earn everything yourself
     
also better drops and yeah"
Maplestory,esiz3s5,t3_c7w9io,1562022967.0,"don't ever buy any time limited clothing in the cash shop 
  
you can get perm nx clothing from purchasing and opening premium style surprise boxes
  
there's an event coming up called the maplehood watch event that's giving out some free perm equips too sometime this month so you can wait a bit for that too"
Maplestory,esiyaq4,t1_esinnvx,1562022541.0,"heyy i just redownloaded maple as well, but a week ago
  
id say to definitely burn mercedes because of her link skill
  
if you want to play pathfinder you can do it after w/ merc's link skill 
  
that's what i did lol and there's no rush in playing as pathfinder unless you want the rewards for the step-up event but you can do the event with certain other classes anyway"

Maplestory,esf14f2,t1_esefziz,1561914582.0,"there are some here and there tbh definitely not as much as the previous years a lot of people still like afk in chairs or mess around with mounts though
  
not sure what world youre in but bera and reboot are very active
   
i recently came back too and it seems like whenever people are being social it's usually just within their guilds or with their friends, but surprisingly there *are* people that you may come across that are willing to befriend you, party with you or ask for help (that's what happened to me)
  
you can always join maplestory's official discord and find people to hang out with as well"
Maplestory,esexx46,t1_esdmgfe,1561912320.0,"actually fuck uhh i forgot about that
  
tbh id say so because certain missions reward you with cubes, xp coupons, scrolls, etc etc and a title but there's a good portion of people that would rather be safe than sorry with the entire thing going on so they dont bother but i mean it's really up to you
  
if you still want to participate but you dont want to risk being banned you can do the event on other certain classes anyway im pretty sure because i was able to on my hayato and hero
  
some of the rewards are also tradable within your account too i think such as the pearl maple set"
Maplestory,esdjmi3,t1_esd3hmc,1561859418.0,"id wait
   
no need to rush"
Maplestory,esbqq5g,t1_es1u5rt,1561807067.0,"maybe hayato?? like the other person said i also found him to be really fun to play and his mobbing is really great 
also you and your gf both start at momijigaoka so lol"
Maplestory,esbq456,t1_es9i5e2,1561806189.0,"yes, if you delete a burning character you will be able to start a new one and get all the boxes again"
