So there’s roughly 130,800,000 households in the US. And 1/20 of those have at least 1 gun owner which means that roughly 6,540,000 people are spurred on to purchase a gun. 

327,000,000/2.5 = 130,800,000

130,800,000 x 1/20 = 6,540,000 

so it’s been 3 months since we’ve all really known about this then that’s an average of 2,180,000 guns a month.

Please point out any assumptions I made incorrectly.

Also fun to think about is that there are several gun owners who didn’t need to purchase another firearm! So several of the 6,540,000 could be new gun owners"

Here’s an older thread but essentially it’s through enchanting initially you go through the lvl 65 dungeons and enchant your level 65 gear.

What caused my PTSD wasn’t something you’d think could just happen especially with a lot of people around now I think about every possible horrible thing that could happen in order to be prepared and have a strategy, unlike before where I was caught off guard and at the mercy of others. Now I refuse to be caught off guard."
