mentalhealth,fmif93t,t3_fvem2a,1586108397.0,It really is awful how little people know or care about mental health issues. I wish people knew how real this is and how it impacts so many people in so many different ways.
mentalhealth,fm6q5yz,t3_ftf9nm,1585800189.0,"hey, i know that feeling, it’s so tough when you feel that people don’t even try to understand you. as the other comment mentioned, it could be because they just can’t. and that shows how much more complex and deep your brain is, and that’s such a wonderful thing. i know it’s easier said than done, but there is someone who does understand you and that’s you! you know your feelings are valid and you can take care of yourself! but it’s normal to want other people to understand you too, feel free to shoot me a message, i promise i’ll try :)"

The first time I did it, it took me a long time to do so as I had to delete each chat individually but I was not at peace until I was done."

TheGoodPlace,fikcmvf,t3_f89pxi,1582477785.0,"The themes explored in the show really had a big impact on me. The show helped me get past some of the bad things that had happened in my life and instead appreciate the good that came with it. And it’s true that the fact that things will end one day gives us a reason to cherish everything we are and can do until then. As you stated, just because something ended bitterly doesn’t mean it didn’t consist of wonderful moments. It is painful but beautiful. I think that’s also because this show teaches us and reminds us that things can get better and do get better, and I believe the sense of hope and peace that ‘The Good Place’ provides is so much more than just a regular message to viewers, it genuinely helps us, it has helped me."
