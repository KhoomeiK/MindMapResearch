I do it in GiMP, creating maps for my eyes only to guide players. A stark, black and white grid map with red Xs for traps or hazards, skulls for enemies, and treasure chests for treasure. Each one is numbered. In one document, I've saved the lists of numbered traps, enemies and treasure for the dwarvish mine. In  the other, the elvish temple.

worldbuilding,fbx8228,t3_eexulx,1577173549.0,"I've got a couple of settings with differing systems, but I'll tell you about one of the more interesting ones.

What are the steps of casting a spell?

1, speak a word of conjuring. This calls the magical force to the wielder. 2, speak a word of shaping, which tells the force how to behave. 3, speak a word of power, which provides the charge to the spell and ""sets it off."" Thinking the words can work, but only for the most disciplined magi.

Can anyone learn to use magic, or only a limited few?

Somewhere in the middle. Most folk can learn a little magic. Few have the constitution to make it a lifestyle. 

How does one learn magic? In school? By a mentor?

Because it involves learning a language and learning how to safely channel arcane energy, it can be self taught if one is cautious, but generally a mage will have a single mentor, though magi with apprentices can have up to 5 or 6 at a time. They travel together and learn on the job.

Can other races learn to use magic too?

Any race with life force and a capacity to speak the right language can use it.

How does emotions affect magic?

Makes it more difficult to focus your body to channel the energy properly, risking a misfire--see below.

What are the drawbacks? How is the user affected?

Spellcasting always fatigues the user proportionate to the task performed and the tome of their mental/spiritual muscles. An arch mage will be much less winded by moving a boulder than a novice, but it will still tax them some amount. 

Is it possible to lose the ability to cast magic?

Only if you lose your tongue or die. Or if your life force is sealed, but that's...another whole slog.

What happens if a spell goes wrong? 

The magic takes the path of least resistance to ground state, releasing as much of its gathered energy as possible, as fast as possible. This usually takes the form of the spell's ""spark"" exploding wherever it currently is. Misfires because the body is poorly disciplined are a little less disastrous, merely being off-target or its effects being slightly off the intended measure or degree. 

How long does it takes to master the basics of magic? 

You can learn a spell in five minutes. To reliably cast it well will take a day or two. To reliably cast many spells takes months. To dedicate them to memory and learn deeper secrets takes years.

How does magic initially manifest?

A spark of smoldering arcane energy in, above or in front of the body."

""New...frre..frriend,"" I slurred, nodding. They both smelled delicious, but I'd resisted long enough that it was getting easier. Sitting up, I looked Tad in the eye and extended a hand. ""Pleee...zdmeetchoo."" Speech was difficult, nearly impossible, since my tongue and jaw didn't fully respond to my conscious efforts. Unless I was eating.

""The...the p-pleasure's...all mine,"" Tad murmured as he stepped forward and tentatively shook my hand. I yanked it and him toward me, letting go as he fell wildly backward, screaming. I laughed, falling back into bed.

""That's mean, Nick,"" Cory admonished me, though he couldn't quite keep a smile off his face. ""He didn't mean it, Tad, he just...Tad, why didn't you say you had to go?""

The newcomer sat in a puddle, staring wild eyed at me and his cheeks burning red. I gave him my very best playful pout and shook my head. ""Don't eat fr..frrendss.""
