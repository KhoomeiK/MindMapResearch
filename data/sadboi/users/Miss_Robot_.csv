Or worse they give generic advice assuming you've never tried all sorts of things or it just makes you feel awful about being disabled.

CPTSD, ADHD, severe chronic depression with intense episodes (occasionally psychotic), BPD, anxiety (social phobia to the point of fear, OCD, EDNOS), sleep problems (sleep apnea, lifelong insomnia and nightmares), and ASD.

I don't view my ASD negatively or even as a disorder per say, but it does pose challenges and it going unrecognized up until four years ago has led to a lot of grief and complications. I strongly suspect there are other undiagnosed conditions, this is what is documented.

All these things make it incredibly difficult for me to just take care of myself let alone dream of working or going to school. I have tried both and burned out. And that's the main issue. I have skills, but nothing I do is stable or sustainable for me to manage on account of what I listed. I'm lucky I don't live on the street.

I hadn't heard those perceptions before, but thank you for listing them. It is a bit of a surprise to me. I was aware of the strength attribute being bit lower than other clans just based on my time playing the game (PC, VTMB).

I realize the nature of being a vampire means of literally and figuratively feeding on others to survive and thrive. There are clans and cultures within them that encourage this. I also know there are vamps who hold onto their humanity, and while they must also take, do so in a conscious and least harmful way.

I understand it much depends on the player/person. And you pose an excellent point. Oh I completely understand that, it can just be unpleasant to experience in the WOD and VTMB community, especially being a Toreador. I do remember reading about that, and certainly more than once.

I very much appreciate your reply, it was pleasant to read. 🙂 Perhaps in time I will gain enough understanding and perspective to be able to detach and cast aside the unpleasantness. It may also be that some who have such strong feelings, it is merely a reflection of their passion for the WOD and VTMB. Hm. Any who, I bid you a fair day, afternoon and evening."

LateStageCapitalism,fbdehks,t3_eciwup,1576759535.0,"I wish more people knew SNAP is supplemental. It is guaranteed you will need to have additional income to put towards food (be it yours or someone else's) and visit at least one food shelf each month. For instance my supplement is 190, currently my mom helps me.

Before then I went to food shelves. But when I first moved into my place I was living the nothing for three or four solid months (my friends had to buy my groceries because my benefits had to switch counties). They were able to stock me with enough but I did go hungry at different points in each month (I slept a lot).

I also wish there was greater awareness of the program itself and its eligibility standards (as well as what it is like to spend 40 hours looking for work if you don't have a job). That there is a diversity of recipients who are working or looking, families, single parents, the elderly, children and the disabled.

That the circumstances greatly vary and are nuanced. That a household can technically make enough money to not need support but still struggle. It's amazing how much of a rigorous course people are put through to be deemed worthy of supports of any kind. As if it is a waste.

By aiding the country and individual communities it is an investment. People talk about and have this darwinist attitude, demand we contribute everything to society and yet when individuals or groups need society to give more than labor it is considered weakness, unwillignness to help oneself, a sign of poor character, indecency and parasitism.

The fact that our culture and society in the U.S. (I can only speak for here) considers those who are poor as a wasteful investment is sad. Yet things like war and corporate bailouts isn't. And while some of these folks complain and say good riddance to social aid, they are not willing to do what is required to truly address disparity.

It's easier to scapegoat and blame those effected than admit society and civilization is flawed and a major contributing factor. Not to mention the complexity of poverty, it's barriers and impacts on development, housing, mental health and cognitive functioning, nutrition, transportation, education, societal mobility and opportunities in general).

The classist lenses causes unfair off base observations, disdain, criticism and judgment of the poor that if the shoe is on the foot of the wealthy, may be glazed over, not formed at all, praised, defended or viewed in a far less harsh favorable light even."

I definitely agree with what you are stating and want to clarify by personal responsibility I certainly do not mean it as in ""just do it,"" or if it is an affliction of the mind it is a matter of mind. My personal meaning of if is doing what is in your power to do, not blaming a person for what they can't. I do find it stimulating and interesting what you've written and still have yet to take time to digest it. Thank you for commenting!"
mentalillness,f5ucgtx,t1_f5sn9fh,1572471318.0,"I want to clarify I am not looking for advice, but discussion (it's why I used the discussion flair). I want to hear about other people's lives -- if they've been through or felt the same."
mentalillness,f5slrdg,t1_f5slku1,1572435944.0,"I hope to hear some of your experiences or addition thoughts. I've tried that honestly, and it is why I an in the bleak place I found myself in for a majority of my life. I get out ever so often, as well as necessities but otherwise spend 95% of my time housebound. I genuinely can't do that anymore, conform. It causes me so much pain and has only ever caused me harm (so much 💔💙). I do understand that this is probably how you've managed to survive, I get that ❤ Thank you for commenting, truly."
BoJackHorseman,f5scndo,t1_f5oukpl,1572422913.0,"Depends on the sphere, a sculpture, painter, author -- probably not. Musician? Maybe (I think yes actually)? An actor or other kind of celebrity, yes. And there is a fair amount of evidence to back this up. I appreciate how class and legal consequence was brought up 💜 It boils my blood (the issue, not the show)."
teentitans,f5rvx3l,t3_dok0ej,1572404273.0,The family picture frame is a nice touch -- you all look great! 😀😊
gatekeeping,f5rn6yd,t1_f5rh0ca,1572398290.0,Oooo I have strange techno powers *spooky voice* 😁☺ In all seriousness I am glad to hear that! It definitely wasn't me I swear (maybe the universe heard me).
gatekeeping,f5r5yio,t1_f5qxyl1,1572388714.0,"I wish I could give you gold. I'd like to try Reddit premium, so I am saving your comment -- if I do I am totally giving you an award ❤"
wholesomememes,f5kclvf,t3_do4u51,1572260078.0,"Wholesome unless your father is/was abusive, absentee or inconsistent in regard to his relationship with you. My mom on the other hand, I can imagine where I would be without her, it keeps me up at night and I make sure to thank her all the time. She has always been an advocate, and though we definitely have had our rough times, we've been through a lot together. She has only ever tried to do her best, I am glad she is my mother <3 I want to be clear, this is not a slight against the photo, creator or OP."
LateStageCapitalism,f5k5669,t3_do6gni,1572255131.0,"I surely understand the sentiment, though what I would prefer is reforms and efforts that truly help first responders be it more supplies, staff, better access to mental health services -- whatever is needed. I cannot speak for what Google or other tech firms are doing, I am just expressing my thought. In a nutshell I want and hope always, the words are not simply empty."
antinatalism,f5k0m2i,t3_do3jyy,1572250435.0,The comments of the video are grade A. I might just post them (usernames blurred) to r/childfree or my Insta story XD
depression,f5i9497,t3_dnr47a,1572212174.0,"They aren't. They lack the emotional intelligence to provide comfort and understanding to you, and that is not only a shame and does harm, none of this is your fault. Not every reason or causality will be obvious, this does not somehow mean it does not exist. Your pain is real and valid. Think of the universe, we cannot possibly follow or know every pattern and ripple.

Is there any way I and others in the subreddit can be supportive right now?"
depression,f5i4bez,t3_dny0md,1572210779.0,"I want to validate how you feel. I do not want to comment one way or another on suicide on account of how personal it is -- I also refuse to moralize it. I can empathize and relate, I understand how much pain you must be in. The most I can say is thank you for sharing <3 I don't have all the answers, life is hard and we all cope the best we can. I love you stranger <3"
CPTSD,f5hxvuo,t3_dnwlt6,1572208927.0,"I genuinely want to ask what support you are needing and or asking for. The only reason is for clarity so I am not offering anything that is unwanted. Dependent upon this, I might have a few thoughts."
depression,f5hian4,t3_dnwk3g,1572204627.0,"I will read your post, just bear in mind it is a lot to process, not that it is somehow unworthy of my time and attention -- it is more than worthy. Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing with us all 💜"
LateStageCapitalism,f5hbt2u,t3_dnxwqz,1572203008.0,"A couple choice comments on the post, one of which was ""cute, now get a job,"" and ""then move somewhere where costs of living are cheaper,"" in that same thread. I was so tempted to write, ""that costs money.""
