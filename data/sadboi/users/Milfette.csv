You must identify with 5 of the 9 traits

Fear of abandonment. People with¬†BPD¬†are often terrified of being abandoned or left alone. ...

Unstable relationships. ...

Unclear or shifting self-image. ...

Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors. ...

Self-harm. ...

Extreme emotional swings. ...

Chronic feelings of emptiness. ...

Explosive anger.
