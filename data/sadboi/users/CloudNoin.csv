Advice,fp8jnv8,t3_gbssxv,1588394064.0,"It doesn't sound like you're in a safe situation in a way. The fact that your partner is against you using birth control is completely wrong, especially if he is not putting effort in taking care of the kids he's essentially the reason for them being there.  I don't think you husband is being a good father, let alone, husband as it seems as if he is leaving you with the workload of raising the kids. 

You sound burnt out, especially because essentially you didn't want these kids. Maybe invest in getting the birth control Nexplanon? It's an implant in your arm that last years that I currently have, that way there's no pills your husband can throw out. 

Something needs to change, for your mental health and for your kids and that is your husband changing for the better, he needs to learn how to raise kids the right way and the both of you need to talk about how you want to raise them. You appear to be doing all the work and that's not fair.

I wish you the best and hope your situation changes."

If you have someone you trust, you can ask them to create the password so you don't unlock the app itself and so you can lock other apps and set yourself a specific time to use your phone, eg 1-5, 1-9, just limiting yourself. Im using this system currently and it has been helping a great deal. The app itself s called AppLock. I also use YourHour to see the progress i'm making and such. I've found how dependent i've become on my phone and starting to see how useless instagram and snapchat can be, reddit to an extent too. Goodluck!"

So now, when you have this one person to give you validation and support, you cling to them for it. Really,  its about providing that validation for yourself, affirming to yourself that you're a great person,  basically just gaining confidence in yourself and your abilities.
