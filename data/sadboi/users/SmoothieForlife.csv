Also he was convicted of 3 felonies.. Also he had male infertility.  And my mother lived with us for about a year. I was her only caretaker for 8 years.  One of our children had mental health issues and one was a juvenile delinquent. I saw evidence of the affair on internet and hired a private detective to  confirm. I confronted him and he denied he was seeing another woman. I filed for divorce and the court said both of us had to live in our house. My husband' s woman was married and lived 3 miles away. He saw her during the year we were divorcing and living in the same house. After divorce he moved her into a house we had owned.  He hurt her. There was  domestic violence and he had to move and go to court. He moved to another state and it took 2 and 1/2 years to sell our family home. I had to mow and vacuum and keep the house nice to sell. He violated his restraining order with the woman and got in extra legal trouble for that. His next woman accused him of trying to kill her. They parted ways. Now he has a wife. I doubt he has told her his history. My disabled son lives with me and my other son won't  spend time with me even on holidays.  I date some, but I'm old now and not good looking. There are more women than men at my age. Men my age prefer younger women.  I'm losing hope of finding a man in my life.

Once you have divorced and spent some time evaluating and working on your emotions, I think the women who get better find a great man  or a passion  and that helps them move forward.

There are certain words used in your profile that attract more responses. It is good if your pictures would attract a woman you might want and cause others to keep swiping. For example if you were in a band and you had a picture of you performing, then some women would be drawn to that and others would not want a guy in a band. A little red color in your picture is good. It is good to have pictures that might prompt a question like how did that bird land on your finger?

There is no  emotional connection.  The brain is stimulated from what is seen. Feel good chemicals in the brain are produced similar to drug addiction.

You are young and have time to find someone great Dr .Henry Cloud has a good you tube on why am I not getting dates? Two points he makes is that you have a routine of where you go and what you do so you always see the same people and seldom encounter someone new. So try some new activities and break up the routine.  The other point is some people always look for a type to date and may not be aware of it.  They limit their choice to say "" the cheerleader bouncy outgoing type' for example.  There may be a shy nerd type in the room but they never consider that person for a date.

Cheating on me?  And when you discover the worst, it wounds you in a deep way. It is a kind of PTSD. You don't trust yourself to see things straight.  You doubt your attractiveness and  abilities. It can be pervasive and affect thoughts about your future.  This is false thinking. at some point your spouse decided they did not have to honor the vows they  made to do everything possible to keep you two tight and close. They made a decision to be married to you and sneak around with someone else.  They could have done lots of things, but they chose to lie and cheat you. All of that was outside your control. Chances are you are not perfect and there is room for being a better person. You need to be in control again. Give yourself a time each day to feel grief.  Write a journal. Get a counselor. Join a Divorce group or 12 step group, work on your spiritual side.  That is good self care. But you also need to find single friends who like to be active and do things you love.
