If you don't eat anything for 6 hours and then eat a full meal and then don't eat for another 6 hours (for example), it really puts a strain on the digestive tract. Try to eat small things throughout the day and if you can get some actual meals in there. Taking anything like laxatives will also make it worse in the long run. I try to have prunes, soy yogurt or cashew milk with flaxseed, applesauce, pears. This helps keep your digestive tract working and moving things along."

I never disagreed with you, though. People should have the right to refuse to date anyone. I wouldn't want to date an active drug addict, but I also wouldn't refuse to date someone simply because they had dealt with addiction in the past. 

I do agree that it's okay to not want to date someone because their trans. Boundaries are good, it's just important to know why you have them. I probably wouldn't want to date someone in the depths of a mental breakdown, but I wouldn't refuse to date someone because they are or were mentally ill (depending on how well it was being managed).

I'm really not as good as I should be with how long I've been playing, but I'm certainly not terrible. I can play fairly high level stuff, I suppose.

Sometimes I can accept my missed notes, sometimes I can't. The first thing I always do if I'm struggling is to try and slow down the tempo a couple times and see if I can get it right then. If I can't, I try to practice something else. If that doesn't work, well, sometimes it's best to step away for a while. 

Even amazing musicians miss notes, both in practice and performance. Most tend not to hear it as long as the musician doesn't give it away (usually by falling off tempo due to frustration). I remembered I once played for a wedding ceremony and had one song where I had definitely missed quite a few notes. I was rather embarrassed until I found out no one heard any of my mistakes and apparently quite a few  in the crowd were making positive comments. A few missed notes in a song usually go unnoticed by the listener, but are glaring and obvious to the player."

So telling yourself that a thought is wrong or stupid is rarely helpful. Instead I try to work through why following through on a thought wouldn't actually get me anything I need and try to brainstorm ways that I could meet that need. If a person is making me feel unsafe but hasn't actually done anything to warrant that, then it's on me to devise a way to feel safe.

Vent,fk6jbfb,t3_fgg6u7,1583903877.0,"One of the most freeing and condemning things I ever realized was how little many, many people think about others in a meaningfully empathetic way. Now, this doesn't necessarily translate into selfishness. 

I spent a lot of time lamenting the fact that I had to be the ""planner"" for much of my relationships (at this point my mental health pretty much prevents me from being that now, and subsequently I have few friends and go out rarely). Even now, I do a lot for the few close to me, because I think of them and their happiness and well-being frequently. As hard as it is for me to describe myself in a positive light, I guess I'd consider myself thoughtful. I buy small gifts for loved ones frequently because I'm out and about and see something that makes me think of them. I make food for them. Hell, for my brother/roommate, I do things constantly that maybe aren't truly in my best interest in the name of supporting a loved one. I paid all the upfront fees (~1000 USD) for our apartment, plus almost all the furnishings. I'm not well off at all (I scavenged thrift stores endlessly for reasonably priced decent furniture), but I am better with money than him and I didn't want him to feel low on savings because I know how stressful that is. Plus I do almost all the maintenance at home (99% of the cleaning, making sure all the electronics and heat are off before bed, keeping all the basics stocked like toilet paper, shampoo & conditioner, dish soap, laundry detergent, hand towels and kitchen towels, etc.). I've tried to talk with him about these things, and while I think he tries to be receptive and change, things go back to status quo pretty quickly. 

Maybe I'm letting myself be taken advantage of (almost certainly to some degree), but I don't think this means he/others don't love, care, and think about me. They do, in different ways. 
I think everyone express affection differently (some call it love languages). 

Sometimes I do get upset and frustrated, but I think the important thing is to remind myself that people almost certainly do care about me. They just express it in ways I'm not very receptive to."

I (F24) have suffered from mental illness for as long as I can remember. For 6 years straight I was in and out of institutions constantly. 

I finally managed to get things to be a little more stable (at least from an outside perpspective) and gain some independance. I moved to a new city, I have an okay job. Everything feels at risk right now, though. My mental health is failing. I'm relapsing in more ways than one. Things at work are tenuous. Things at home are heading that direction, too. 

I genuinely tried to better my mental health, tried to recover. I exhausted every option, for years and years. 
But as you said, it's like people expect you to be cured, and be able to suddenly deal with everything the way a healthy person would. But I'm being crushed. I don't think I'm up to the task.

The longer this disease goes on, the more the illusion of choice disappears. I've tried to ""choose"" so many other behaviors. But I still keep doing this same bullshit. Like you said, it's normal. Exhausting, disturbing, and somehow normal. 

I haven't had a goal in ages, really. After so many failed attemps at recovering, I just do a lot or risk management. I'm not at the worst I've ever been, but things do slowly keep deteriorating.

My main issue really though is fucking candy. I can't eat very much throughout the day, but if I'm home will regurarly grab like 2 or 3 jelly beans here and there, which can really add up. I try not to keep them in the house but my permastoned ass is weak AF for it"

I don't know about you, but I have twice been lucky enough to have doctors I trusted with having my best interest at heart. I have also had several doctors who prescribed things without looking at the big picture. The worst incident of this was the doctor who treated me when I was in a psych ward at 16 (and who ironically first diagnosed me with anorexia nervosa). He prescribed me a medication that eventually lead me to having a grand mal seizure and being hospitalized. I didn't know it at the time, but being underweight skyrocketed the risk of seizures on that medication. 

It sucks being resricted from a med that you know would be valuable to your well being, but that might only be true if you're at a stable, healthy weight.
