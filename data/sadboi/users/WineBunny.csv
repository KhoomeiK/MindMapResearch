Empaths,f1luhvp,t3_d9ob7z,1569569645.0,"From the comments I've read on this thread and the original post, it seems to be a common thing for us to come to realize we're being bombarded with people emotionally dumping on us (the hows, whys, and what their thought processes are at the time). I'm just so much more aware of predictable behaviors that lead to the emotional dumpster fires others keep throwing at me. 

Like, for example, I've come to a point where I know exactly where my friend's thoughts are when she is emotionally dumping on me. It's also pretty eye-opening when you start to see the signs that people are turned off by her when she engages with others in the same manner she engages with me. I tend to sit politely all the way through her rants (not good).

I'm just glad I'm finally seeing a psychiatrist this weekend. My friend needs one too, and has mentioned it in passing, but it's unlikely she will see one as she has made excuses as to why she isn't doing that now.

Anyway, wishing the best for everyone dealing with something similar. Sending positive vibes to you all. ❤️❤️❤️"

jobs,f18emw1,t1_f17qhdn,1569256594.0,I second your comment so hard. The things I've learned what not to do while serving senior citizens at a waitressing job have applied to my survival skills at a law firm with cranky attorneys who are just as demanding.
jobs,f18dnpd,t3_d85ewi,1569256204.0,"I'm currently in this situation now.. what's ironic is that the first real office job I got at a small law firm was through a temp agency, and I learned the most out of it. I would've stayed there if the firm didn't dissolve.
Now I'm in a big corporate office where I'm under-utilized with no career advancement (the corporate culture here keeps you down where you are. Turnover is high as most people leave due to lack of opportunity for upward mobility).
I'm looking for another job again but damn, this job gives me nothing worthwhile to add to my resume. The review I'd want to put down for this job boils down to ""bs tasks on a daily basis""."
CPTSD,f0hj2c2,t1_f0e0l35,1568623151.0,"I have not thought of that before. Ugh, this sounds like my full-time job and current living situation. Hoping the therapist I'm going to see this month will provide as much insight as this."
Empaths,ez9ywaz,t3_d095zy,1567792010.0,"Yes. Recently got an intern at work (I didn't choose her) who looks like she would one-sided hate f**k me.. just looking into her eyes was unsettling. Sucks, man. Really sucks. Stuck with this person for a semester."
depression,eua5y27,t1_eua5rc6,1563602480.0,"I don't know what I was expecting from it, honestly. My friend doesn't know how to have healthy habits and the same goes for me. We just go to bars for drinks and it's a sad thing really. :/ I get what you're saying though, it's just hard to put it into practice."
Empaths,eu7pnph,t3_ce9a6j,1563539507.0,"Facing this dilemma myself these days. Most people around me in this area seem to be stuck in their own head, unwilling to see how neglecting their own emotions causes them to act in shitty ways (passive aggressive, mean, harsh, etc). And when they show you compassion or try to mirror your empathic behavior, it is mostly a farce to make themselves appear as good people.  

I'm 29 and the only other empath I've met in real is a person I played an online game with. We've been close friends since then. He seems to just ""get"" me despite the fact that we only see each other face to face like twice a year, and most of our interactions involve messaging on the PlayStation app. But he is a fellow empath and it doesn't take him a whole lot of effort to just understand emotional waves I send."
depression,etoxtq6,t3_ccmnyu,1563040392.0,All the Yes to this idea. I wanted this so badly last night as I was having a weekly outing with my friend. I came away from it feeling empty and sad that she can't possibly understand what it is like to be depressed and how depressed people generally interact with each other on this subreddit.

depression,erkniyg,t3_c2fuf3,1560967311.0,"Seriously, I cannot even get the privacy to cry myself to pieces in the house after work. This shit."
depression,ept9apn,t3_bvup45,1559485044.0,"Dude, it is so painful when this happens. :/ I'll be laughing with people and suddenly, BAM I'm reminded by my brain that I'm a sad MF. ..then I have to cover my mouth or turn away so that no one realizes I need to cry a little. Ugh."
jobs,eoch1i4,t3_br9q07,1558458115.0,"I'm in the same boat. Working in an office setting as a Secretary and just steadily getting older with no direction in life... I'd be happier working at Planet Fitness or someplace that promotes fitness, self-growth, and lots of activity. But I need the money I'm making at my current job.

Someone on this thread mentioned that working in an office all day is not natural. I feel this so greatly considering I feel more alive and human in my kickboxing classes after work, where I take my pent-up corporate office bullshit aggression out. A close friend of mine also mentioned that we're naturally Hunter gatherers so it makes sense we want to be outdoors and move around throughout the day (here, I'm referring to your desire to move around throughout the day). Really hits it home in the respect that the office job is killing us emotionally, mentally, and physically."
