TrueCrimeGarage,fqsln40,t1_fqsdlcm,1589610840.0,"You totally get what I meant. There are several small towns where I have spent a lot of time and could easily know out-of-the-way places. 

There are only so many Delphi locals, and statistically speaking only half-ish of them are men. There’s no way someone who matches either sketch wouldn’t have been noticed by now by a local or by local law enforcement. Local cops in small town know so many people, often at least by sight if nothing else!"
DelphiMurders,fqslbnu,t1_fqs2y95,1589610568.0,"That’s the thing...we all just have to do everything we can to be safe, because we never know what could happen. “Is the community as risk?” is a stupid question to begin with - the community is *always* at risk. Because there are always evil people or desperate people out there that do terrible things.  I mean, look what parents do their own children in their own homes!"
DelphiMurders,fqsl1la,t1_fqrt659,1589610326.0,"It’s not the part about telling parents to watch their kids online that’s a problem. It’s the part about them telling people literally the day the girls were found murdered that there was “no threat to the community”. They had no way of knowing that then.  They had no idea who had done it. They hadn’t done any forensic investigation into their phones, computers, or other devices. 

But I do think that their immediate assumption that something Abby & Libby had done online is what led to their brutal murders was disrespectful and unfair...and has so far never been proven."
kansas,fqrrptm,t3_gk6r1g,1589590486.0,"I just want to see their faces when the see my history. They’ll be so confused. Am I insane? A serial killer? A mystery writer? Obsessed with COVID19? Why do I need to know how long it takes a body to decompose in water? Why do I care what lividity is? Wait, this chicken crockpot recipe looks good...."
JustNoSO,fqrrhqt,t1_fqpb5vt,1589590349.0,That quote was the last quote a friend of mine put on her FB page right before she died of an asthma attack (which I strongly suspect was actually an opioid overdose but her family didn’t want the truth out). So I can’t ever see it without thinking of her and the fucking irony of it.

It’s so worth it to me."
breakingmom,fqrlq1b,t1_fqpw7ea,1589586903.0,"I feel this so much. I’m on the verge of making a FB post telling everyone, family or friends, that if they truly believe all that shit I want them to remove themselves from my friends list.

I’m a cancer patient. I was already essentially isolating at home since last September when my chemo started, so I have a fucking 6 month head start. Now I’ve not only had to keep isolating, but there is literally no end in sight for me. Will there be a vaccine? If they manage it, how long is it going to take? My immune system is going to be terrible for months and I’m still getting chemo through September. 

My sister is the only one I’ve been able to see because she isolated herself so she could be with me, and now I’m losing her because her work is re-opening Monday. A child care center. There’s no way we can see each other in person now. Not to mention that she is in the weight category and has high blood pressure, putting her at higher risk also. 

Then there are these assholes who have to whine like little babies because wearing a mask is infringing on their rights! And post shit about how Trump has done a great job managing this situation and that government shouldn’t have the right to interfere in people’s lives.

Well, cancer shouldn’t have the right to interfere in mine. But it did and guess what? I can’t whine about it. I can’t blame Trump or the constitution. I had to keep working from home like I’ve done for months, making less than a lot of my friends whose incomes suddenly doubled due to unemployment and $600 extra a week. Why didn’t those of us still working get an extra $600/wk too? Nobody sent me $600/wk to help pay for the tens of thousands of medical bills I owe. My oncology treatments alone have cost in the hundreds of thousands, so I’m just grateful my share is only in the tens of thousands.

I haven’t seen anyone in my family besides my kids and my sister for months now. Now I won’t even see her. 

But I’m not on FB bitching about Trump and freedom and how it’s so “hard” to wear a mask. Because I’m one of the expendables...they’re all willing to sacrifice me to save that economy. 

It’s depressing as fuck."

Sorry it’s sloppy, but I think I did the math right.  Couldn’t find the hunger stats. But the rest of the deaths, the current number is on the right. Almost every single cause of death has increased its numbers by about 32.5% since the first set of stats was posted, except COVID19, which has increased 85% in the same time frame. 

I’m not a math genius by any means and maybe screwed this all up, but it appears the death rates of all the other reasons are essentially increasing at the same rate, whereas the COVID rate exploded."
DelphiMurders,fqrgbc3,t1_fqrg0gg,1589583785.0,"I know, but my point is that from Day 1, they wanted to blame Abby & Libby. They first accused them of being runaways, even before they were found. Then they were found, and rather than consider that HOLY FUCK there was a murderer on the loose, they decided Abby & Libby must have met someone online and agreed to meet him out at the bridge, therefore bringing their own deaths upon themselves due to their irresponsibility, therefore there was no threat to the community."

DelphiMurders,fqrfpbb,t3_gkfld8,1589583439.0,"Because in the beginning they were convinced Abby & Libby had brought this upon themselves. First they assumed they were runaways. Then when they were found murdered, they assumed Abby &/or Libby had arranged a meetup with someone online that went wrong.

They simply did not want to believe it was actually a random murder. 

At least that’s sure how it came across to me."
