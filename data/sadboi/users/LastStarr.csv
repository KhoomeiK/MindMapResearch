I always have disagreed with this, life can never be worst ... things can be thought to have been 'the worst' in retrospect once all events are considered ...

but living in the present, life can always, always get worse. Today is not necessarily the 'worst' yet, it's positive and optimistic (and good thought) to think life get's better - it may, but it can also get worse, and its just a reality.

TLDR- i disagree with that sentiment that one has gotten through the worst.

Kind post though."
