depression,evt3iag,t3_ckyuve,1564762043.0,"Yeah, it's been like that for god knows how long.. Like, I could have an amazing day or be totally fine during the day, but when night comes, I start to feel depressed and worthless, and usually it's without any reason. Sometimes it happens when I'm playing with friends during nights, I'm fine, and suddenly I start to feel super overwhelmed and depressed by everything, even if nothing special happened. Then I just struggle and struggle, not knowing what to do. It's awful and I don't know how to make it stop."

I'd like to stop going there for good, but, shit, Idk how to bring that up."
depression,evqd4g0,t3_ckmvf8,1564690897.0,"Yup. I went to a psychologist for like, 2 months, she wanted me to get better help to help me recover, saw a psychiatrist for 4 months, and got told my situation is not that bad.
The doctor I saw before going to the psychiatrist told me I have moderate depression and an anxiety disorder.
Not waiting to go back there after school starts. Doesn't help me one bit"
