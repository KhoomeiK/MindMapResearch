I’m sorry about your formative years being such a hell for you. I couldn’t imagine that kind of pressure to be perfect at literally everything.

I honestly wish I had those passions to pursue, I’m just getting back to the gym myself and it seems so small a task I feel like I’m behind everyone else...
