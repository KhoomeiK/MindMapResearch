You're very brave for reaching out for support, it really does make a world of a difference having people to talk to that actually understand what you're going through as this illness can be very isolating and come with a lot of hidden anxiety and depression. I remember when I first got sick I was in university and had basically no support as I was away from all my family and friends. Just driving to school or going for groceries was hard because I never new if the urge to go to the bathroom would hit. My professors weren't very understanding of my being late to labs sometimes, which added extra stress. Many times I'd have to abandon my items when shopping to run to the bathrooms and start all over.

One had written OP orders for all of 2020, based off a visit in Dec 2019, so they've been checking in with one of the doctors regularly. Due to OP being forced to go back to their parents, Ohio GI doc sent their orders to the other Tennessee GI doctor where the parents live, who accepted the orders and set up an appointment for an infusion. If the second doctor had an issue with not having seen OP since 2018, they should have addressed it then and there prior to setting up the appointment. I think it was quite disrespectful for OP to have found out this information by showing up that day, only to be sent home, essentially wasting OP's time by coming in for nothing. I understand doctors need to see patients regularly but it's not like OP hadn't been seen by anyone, but regardless, someone really should have called them and advised them of the change of plans to prevent their treatment from being bumped back a week, risking potential complications to them. If I was in their situation I would have assumed everything was good to go because they confirmed the Tennessee doctor received and accepted the orders from Ohio doctor and had an appointment date and everything.

I'm a bit confused by your timelines for things though, did you start taking anti-depressants around the same time you started the prednisone? Because if so, this could also be strongly contributing to your decline in mental health recently, along with the prednisone. There's always a risk for increased anxiety/depression/suicidal thoughts when starting on new anti-depressants and if so, you'll need to follow up with your family doctor ASAP to let them know what you're experiencing. Either way, some of the symptoms you're describing and the fact that you're considering taking more medications has me worried for you, and you still have a ways to go in your prednisone treatment yet. I'd strongly encourage you to call your family M.D or specialist about the way you're feeling. There are options for medications you can use as needed or just while you're on the prednisone, to help you with anxiety, sleep troubles, or to address that feeling of not being sure what's real (something called derealization). As far as the marijuana goes, I tend to tread lightly on the topic. Some people swear by it as a helpful tool in managing anxiety. I've also seen chronic users become unable to use marijuana anymore as they found, over time, that it actually worsened their anxiety. Due to it being psychoactive and all, it could theoretically be interacting with the prednisone in a way that could be making your symptoms worse, especially the derealization you mention. I hope you can take solace in the fact that what you're experiencing is just temporary, and you can and will get through this, and you certainly are not crazy by any means.

Nurses and doctors already have died from this. I don't think it's too much to ask for some compassion for the bad situation nurses are in right now. Saying they should just quit isn't an appropriate response because it doesn't change the situation either. And I'm not saying that you as a person, need to do anything special or have a solution to this problem. A lot of what's failing the system is governments lack of emergency preparedness and moving production of medical supplies overseas. That unfortunately cannot be changed right now, but people spreading awareness of this horrible situation may incite some major changes in shifting of funds for emergency preparedness and hospital equipment. Saying ""it's your job, you should be lucky to work, just quit if you don't like it"" let's the people responsible think they can get away with literally putting people's lives on the line! And let me remind you, it's not just nurses and doctors who will suffer because of this. Patients in hospital will be at risk for contracting this virus if staff cannot adequately prevent the spread of infection so we are all affected by this in the end. That could be somebody you love. As far as what can be done now, the CDC already outlines a lot of ways to allow for medical personnel to make supplies last longer through a variety of ways, through special processes in which supplies may be decontaminate and reused, revamping the set up of units, and utilising technology, but still hospitals have been slow to act despite having expert information easily accessible."
pics,fngptvr,t1_fngobey,1586940496.0,"First of all, there is not a single person on earth that would risk their lives and their livelihood to do a job for zero pay, because we have to, you know, pay bills. We also seem to have this strange natural tendency to want to keep ourselves alive. While I don't know where you live, however, most places that are hard hit right now and struggling with PPE were not dealing with massive issues of job competitiveness, before this or now. Some more popular areas were a little more saturated than others, but that's just to be expected. You can find job postings begging nurses and doctors to come to the U.S all the time. Doctors and nurses get a pay that is relative to their education and responsibilities and as an incentive to work because we NEED them. You know, to keep people alive. Secondly, hospital administrations do not always have degrees in nursing or doctor related fields, and if so, their goals and directives often clash non stop with those of frontline workers for a variety of reasons, money usually being one of the top ones. Although I have to throw out there, that I'm sure there are plenty of amazing hospital administrators out there stuck in a shitty situation due to government shifting of resources. Thirdly, did I make any claims or demands that it was anyone's responsibility asides from those actually employed at hospitals and government to do something about this situation? No, I never. What I do think, is that people should care and show some empathy towards the situation and not allow the media's putting nurses on pedestals undermine from what's really going on in the inside. They're only using it as a tactic to deflect from what's really going on. I completely agree that government and hospital administrations emergency preparedness is what is failing us right now. But if you're so jealous of the fact that nurses and doctors still get to make their full wage during the pandemic go and get an entry level job at a hospital in the interim, I'm sure they'd love the extra staff.

Nobody EVER agreed to die when they got their doctor or nursing licenses. Yes sure, she could quit. But that's not going to solve ANYTHING. All that'll accomplish is hospitals becoming more severely understaffed during a global pandemic when the majority of the time hospitals are already operating understaffed under normal circumstances. Plus, in case you didn't realize, hospital staff not having proper equipment is going to result in the virus spreading to more patients, themselves  and other medical staff, resulting in less staff available at work to care for the growing number of sick patients, more and more spreading, and more deaths. I would hate to have someones death on my conscience because the people I work for didn't give me the equipment I'm entitled to, to protect them. I doubt you'd be this cold if somebody you loved died as a result of lack of hospital resources. People need to care about what's happening and see the bigger picture here. Simply throwing up your hands and saying ""We don't have equipment for you, either risk your life or quit, you signed up for this"" is not an acceptable response. Hospital administrations need to be doing everything in their damn power to get that equipment to staff. People like you need to give a damn about what's happening in hospitals. If you know anything about hospital administrators, 9/10 times they think that if they can get away with something, they will do it. Not to throw shade, cause I'm sure there are plenty of amazing hospital administrations out there stuck in a shitty situation due to government pulling back on funds for emergency preparedness and equipment.

Yes, she could quit, but is that really going to change the problem? She's trying to raise awareness for what's going on. Hospital administrations need to be exposed, but the only way they can realize this is by nurses in the frontlines speaking up. Walking away will do nothing. Throwing other people at the problem will do nothing. Most nurses love their patients and co-workers too much to walk away from it all and so are stuck in this awful predicament of wanting to help but being scared of infecting themselves and others whilst simultaneously realizing walking away will also make the situation much worse as well.

BipolarSOs,fn59gz0,t3_fzd6os,1586659166.0,"Well, most of what you say I agree with. Namely I, like you, would say that I also don't find this sub helpful, but I guess I'm partly to blame because I have a positive story to share that I could post about, but I don't. One point of contention though; while bipolar disorder doesn't directly cause cheating per say, it does affect impulsivity and self control, which has been known to lead to infidelity and sexual promiscuouty which are behavioural changes one would enquire about when assessing someone in a manic episode. Does that mean that every bipolar person cheats? No. If a bipolar person does cheat, does that mean they're manic? No. Should BPSO's accept and tolerate cheating because it COULD be related to a manic episode? Heck no. I often think when I read these posts that some of the domestic issues the poster is writing about are actually a personality/morality issue on their partners behalf, and not manifestations of their bipolar disorder. One sign of this is usually when the bipolar spouse refuses to take accountability for their actions and consistently repeats the same behavior over and over, but blames it on their mental illness. They guilt their partner into tolerating their behaviour. Another reality that we all have to recognize when we read these posts is that the BP spouse posting has a history too. This history usually isn't talked about, as it focuses on the history of the bipolar individual. That history might include coming from an abusive home, or having been in an abusive relationship, or just never having a positive role model demonstrate what a loving, respecting relationship looks like. They may have their own mental health struggles too. This causes a lot of people to internalize negative thoughts and beliefs about themselves and the type of treatment they can expect in a relationship. It can be hard to leave a relationship when you may believe deep down, you're deserving of that behavior, you think it's the best treatment you'll ever get, or the partner breaks down your self esteem so badly that you just can't ever imagine moving on. They cling to the idea that this is just bipolar symptoms and one day they'll change. I try to remind myself of this when I read frustrating posts where I just wanna scream ""This is not bipolar behavior! They're using and abusing you and you deserve so much better!"" Every situation is nuanced and complex, though. Unfortunately, it paints people with bipolar disorder in a bad light, which they are undeserving of. There are a lot of loving, loyal, and compassionate bipolar people out there. I know, because I have an amazing partner who has bipolar disorder. I'm also sure there's been some really loving, loyal and compassionate partners who have cheated or pushed their partner away when manic or depressed, and feel very sorry for what they've done, and I imagine reading the posts here really don't help in moving on from their past."
UlcerativeColitis,fn3fru0,t3_fz6xv3,1586619838.0,"Based off what I read, they usually prescribe 40mg on average cause they've found it to be as effective as 60mg but with less side effects. I've read of people going as high as 100mg before though, but for other conditions. They do take weight based dosing into the equation for prednisone as well, depending on the situation."
BipolarSOs,fn1ih90,t3_fykqrq,1586562710.0,"In my personal opinion, some of the issues people post about on here are actually issues with their partners personality and not manifestations of their mental illness, but that's just my .02 cents. There are lots of us in wonderful relationships but it just doesn't get posted about in comparison to the amount of horror stories. I've been with my partner for a year and a half and he's the most kind, loyal, and loving person I've ever met. He is without a doubt the best partner I've ever had. That being said, it hasn't been easy or perfect, but he puts in a lot of effort to help himself which I think is key to a successful relationship. If he wasn't willing to see a psychiatrist and take meds it would be an absolute deal breaker for me. He did go through a very bad depressive episode in the fall last year where he was suicidal and off work for 2 months but he finally found the right combination of psych meds and he's been totally thriving, I'm very proud of him. He used to rely on cannabis to help cope with his anxiety and depression but he's been free from all drugs since last September. His mood is stable and he says he feels happy for the first time in his life. He exercises 4 times a week. He holds down a good paying, full time job. He treats me with respect and I've never once questioned his love and loyalty to me. Please do not fret that you are a bad person because you have this illness. While it may be an important part of who you are, it does not define who you are as a person."

braces,fmgxwfh,t1_fmgie38,1586060836.0,"I agree that your teeth do affect your well-being 100%, however the price you pay in the end seems very reasonable to me given the fact that you'll likely be receiving treatment by your dentist or orthodontist over the course of several years. They need to pay for the building, the staff, their time, the technology, the training, etc, which doesn't come cheap. That and, most offices have made orthodontic work accessible for those with low income. I only pay $150 a month for my orthodontic treatment and I think that's a reasonable amount for someone to be able to afford even in a lower income tax bracket for something that for most is a cosmetic luxury and not medically necessary."

braces,fmf65h9,t3_fuvrsk,1586020717.0,"Your ex friend is only bugging you about your teeth because you've already demonstrated that they bother you to her. That's how bullies work, they prey on your insecurities. The fact that your boyfriend disagrees and says he loves your teeth makes me think that whatever is wrong with your teeth is likely minor. There's nothing wrong with teeth that aren't perfectly straight, and many places in the world criticize the US for their obsession with perfectly straight white teeth. One day when you're an adult and you have your own money, you can look into getting braces if you still feel the same way about it. I didn't get mine until I was 25 cause I couldn't afford it either. Many places will allow you to make low monthly payments so you don't have to pay for it all upfront. Until then, I can confidently say that people care way more about your happiness and oral health, not the straightness of your teeth. I've dated plenty of people with crooked teeth but I still liked them because I liked what was inside, and when they smiled with confidence it amplified that even more so. If you take good care of what you got with regular brushin and flossin I can guarantee that when you smile, people see the beauty of who you are inside shine through, they're not pulling out an imaginary ruler and measuring each little mm deviation that your teeth may be out of line."

UlcerativeColitis,fm8ihto,t1_fm7r539,1585849997.0,"I hope you don't mind my replying to this, but I am an RN as well and was diagnosed with UC in my 2nd year of nursing school. I haven't had a flair nearly as bad as my first, thankfully, because I barely made it through my clinicals back then. I think your ability to be able to work during a flair will largely depend on how you feel and how severe your symptoms are. For example, if you're having to rush to the bathroom constantly it wouldn't really be a safe situation for your clients if you had to leave them if they were unstable, or in the middle of a transfer/procedure. I managed to go 2 years as a ward nurse with no issue, but decided to move into mental health because the hours were better and I had more control of my schedule and felt like if I ever needed to run out on a client to use the bathroom there would be less potential of leaving them in an unsafe situation. I'm currently going through a flair right now but I've still managed to go to work, except for one day I called in sick cause I hadn't slept right in 3 days from the dreaded prednisone insomnia. I don't know where you live but I'd definitely consider a unionized hospital for employment because you're likely to be more protected using your sick days vs non unionized, but that's just my speculation, I've never been employed at a non union hospital."

BoJackHorseman,fm3ha7a,t1_fm3fvpa,1585723489.0,"I think that their emotions in this moment are definitely positive and not malicious. I imagine for most people, the initial wave of emotions after having a baby does make you happy in a selfish kind of way. You're living in this fantasy of the bright, shiny future you see for yourself and your new family. So what they're feeling right now is not unusual for new parents. However, most parents then go on to love and care for their kids  for their own sake (loving others makes us feel connected to others and therefore good) and the child's, by doing selfless acts for their growth and happiness, and because they genuinely want what's best for them.  Not once in the show did they ever have Beatrice or Butterscotch act on or express love and affection for his sake, even when he was really young, so it kind of takes away from the family bliss depicted here because it feels like they're only happy over Bojack because of their own selfishness."
BoJackHorseman,fm3dwoc,t1_fm3cayq,1585720276.0,"You make a good argument, but I think the difference here is that they're selfishly enjoying how bojack being born has made them a family and how that makes them feel good, rather than showing love and affection to bojack to make him feel good."

Mainly affects scalp but can affect the face and other body parts as well, particularly side of the nose. It likes oily parts of the body. If that's indeed what you have, you would just use that shampoo to wash your face as well around two times a week, leaving it on to penetrate for a couple minutes. I'd recommend seeing a doc if you are able to for confirmation, but my ex had seborrheic dermatitis and this is what his dermatologist advised him to do."

UlcerativeColitis,fkrvo3c,t3_fk8y8s,1584476958.0,"I find taking hot baths until pain meds kick in great for dealing with the cramps and rectal pain. Hot pads are wonderful too. Make sure you get plenty of rest, with the pain and inflammation your body will require more than usual, I get 10 hours sleep typically during a bad flair. If you're a traveller, you may want to consider carefully the water sanitation and food prep safety of said destination as my colitis has not been very friendly with me in that regard. Exercise when well, as exercise has been shown to reduce inflammation, osteoporosis (if doing resistance training), and colon cancer (which we're at risk for). Whether you feel up to exercise during a flair is up to you, I generally don't do much other than gentle walks or yoga during a flair, but don't feel bad if you can't do anything! Some people find that exercise just makes them more tired and worsens their GI symptoms, so go with what your body tells you. Prednisone causes muscle wasting as a side effect, so ensure you're getting enough protein in your diet to help combat this (ensure makes a high protein drink, and you can ask the dietician to order you protein powder additives when you work your way up to things like soup). For some people prednisone can cause some pretty bad psychiatric side effects, like depression and irritability, so be prepared and warn your partner about that. I was lucky and it actually caused me to have way increased energy and motivation instead, so it's not all bad :)"
