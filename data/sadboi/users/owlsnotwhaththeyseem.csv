kansascity,fkyk7ps,t3_flf7ci,1584650379.0,"I actually moved back to KC after living in Austin, TX for 15 years, so I may have some answers for you.  Austin has changed quite a lot over the past years...it has gotten expensive and is, unfortunately, losing a lot of its charm.   It just happens naturally when a city grows as quickly as Austin goes.  I was renting a 1300 sq. foot house in a northern suburb and was paying $2000/month.   It gets more expensive as you get closer to the city.   Now, I still think Austin is a good city!  I was just drowning in rents and crazy AC bills.   I love the spirit of KC.  The city has so much pride and I am definitely happy I moved back.    I would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have!"

kansascity,fkvekea,t1_fkvdtq6,1584567625.0,"Honestly, at that age the most important thing is that get used to the idea that numbers represent something.  I always recommend counting everything, looking a the numbers on all types of packaging and talking in simple terms about what those mean (number of items in a box, etc. ).  We want kids to think of numbers are fun and that they have the ability to tell stories.   As a super early exposure to addition and subtraction, I have used to Lego's to show that if you have a larger piece and you top it with smaller pieces, the smaller pieces can create the same shape and size as the larger piece.   I would also talk up the idea of fractions at a super early level.   If your child enjoys math, counting by 5s on an analog clock is also great.    Money is also fun for kids and can be used to count.  However, coins can be confusing as it seems like there is no reason that five pennies should equal a nickel.  My main recommendation is to just talk about numbers in a conversational way to show a child how important they are to daily life."

I would never ask him for that money back...that is absolutely ridiculous.   I could have always told him no, but I didn't.   You owe your parents nothing...not any money, nor to continue dancing.   You are your own person and should only dance if it brings you joy.  Your parents are being ridiculous."
