She's also a stay-at-home mom and her kids go to school during the day - of course she has time to work out and get a great body!

I was an awkward, ugly duckling until I was about 20, and then all of a sudden I finally blossomed and lost the baby weight. It was a glorious eight years of FINALLY having high self-esteem before I got pregnant! My post-baby body isn't quite the same, but I've come to terms with it and I'm finally happy with the curves my kid left me. But I work full-time and barely have enough time to fit in a workout when I'm also trying to cook meals, do hobbies, and spend quality time with my kid and husband. There's no way I'd have ANY time with another kid. Maybe it's vain but looking good makes me happy and having more kids isn't conducive to that!"

If it makes you feel any better, I also get racing thoughts sometimes and can't sleep because of it. They're uncontrollable and random and just won't stop until they eventually do, but then I wake up exhausted. Pretty sure it's just a side effect of anxiety or a panic attack, but it's something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Sometimes Xanax helps but sometimes it doesn't."

Years ago I had an online friend and was also terrified of phone calls. I was honest about it with him and I think our first phone call lasted maybe 20 seconds before I freaked out, didn't know what to say, and hung up. But he was understanding about it and we kept chatting online and occasionally on the phone, even though some of those conversations were super short because I panicked. Eventually I was able to get over that fear and I'm really thankful of that because I don't know if I would have ever gotten through that anxiety about talking on the phone otherwise.

What helps me is getting positive feedback from my boss, so that's great that youre going back to a good boss! Being able to talk openly about his goals for you and your progress might help you get more comfortable once you're there.

Also, I have a lot of to-do lists which helps me, by giving me a tangible list of my accomplishments over time. And taking lots of notes during meetings always seems to make people think I work harder than I actually do, which makes me feel more secure in my position.

Parenting,fjgyq0w,t3_fdenf5,1583338147.0,"Definitely look up the state inspection reports first.

I looked for cleanliness, brightness, teacher retention, safety features (ie, buzzers on doors, locked gates, no way for a kid to get out of the building by themselves). Also, find out their protocol on sick students and if they charge for weeks you're on vacation.

I also thought it was important they have some kind of ""curriculum."" I'm paying absurd amounts for daycare so I wanted my kid to be learning things and to make sure the teachers are tracking developmental milestones. Even as an infant, his teachers would do sensory activities and tons of tummy time. 

I specifically picked a daycare that doesn't utilize bouncers or sit-in walkers, since I felt they inhibited my infant from learning to use his body (plus, imo it's easier for a teacher to plop a kid in those and ignore them since they're contained).

Interaction of teachers with students was also important to me. The kids at my chosen daycare LOVE their teachers. But one daycare I toured, the toddler teacher was negative and yelling at the kids and that was the only interaction I saw from her the entire time. If they're willing to act like that in front of prospective parents, what are they doing alone? Another daycare had several women with those long claw manicures - no way the cleanliness was up to par, and how the heck are they changing diapers?

Take a tour, and then take a second tour when you think you've decided. Show up unexpectedly - they should still allow you to take a tour, and that way you see the daycare in its true day-to-day state since they weren't prepared for your arrival."

I hope your leadership can get some standards set soon, that always makes work easier. Definitely try and ask for that if you can, because it would probably take some of that worry off your shoulders.

I don't know exactly what you do for work, but does your company use any kind of project management software? It's really helped me when I have all my projects on a schedule with each step laid out. It's a lot less well overwhelming when I know I can work on a few tasks a day and still meet my final deadline in time.

You've only been in that position for about 8 months. If it helps you feel any better, I felt the same way when I started my first management position. It probably took me a good year before I really got into the groove of things.

Anxiety,fjeidbu,t3_fczk6n,1583272232.0,"I think one of the biggest problems with having anxiety is that our brains are always looking for more to worry about. It's like we're miswired to never be content.

From what you've written, it sounds like it's a good job for you and makes you happy. And you never know where this job will take you or if it will lead to another opportunity. Maybe it's just a job to get you comfortable and you conquer another position down the line. Either way, work doesn't always have to be hard to be worthwhile! The fact that you've found a position you like is awesome!

Maybe try to remind yourself of the good aspects whenever your brain tries to think negatively. Whenever I have a negative thought, I try and drown it by thinking about a bunch of positives."

I would suggest writing down everything you can, and tracking what might cause the anxiety if it happens to you a lot.

Anxiety is so stupid and makes no sense. 

Honestly mine probably didn't get better until college, just because you're stuck seeing the same people every day in high school so those thoughts fester so much easier. (Plus high school kids just suck in general lol). After high school those worries went away, because I saw different people all the time and every day wasn't the same schedule. 

But, if you want to get rid of that feeling, I would suggest just trying to add something different to your wardrobe once a week or so. When your brain starts realizing that other people aren't noticing or caring, it will make trying different things easier."

Baby powder in shoes helps reduce odor. Lotion can also help make you smell good throughout the day, plus it will keep your skin moisturized!"

Anxiety,f2ddb1n,t3_dcu5cd,1570151236.0,"I feel like both sometimes. If I'm at a safe space like my house then I can usually control it and within an hour or so it'll pass. Even at work I'm usually okay because I can disappear to a quiet bathroom or my office to calm myself.

If I'm not, then the anxiety is in control. I went out to a brewery tonight for an event I go to every year, but could only stay for twenty minutes because my anxiety was causing sensory overload and it was unbearable. :/"
Anxiety,f2dcxel,t3_dcue24,1570150957.0,"I only shake with anxiety, thankfully less than I used now that I've learned how to deal with the panic after all these years. Usually it starts with palpitations and restlessness, then the inevitable sense of dread and shaking. Most of the time just my legs but my hands shake when I try and use them, but I've had attacks so bad that my teeth chatter. Those are the kind I can't do much about and I have to ride through it until my body is so exhausted I fall asleep."
Anxiety,f2dcdil,t3_dd02ns,1570150565.0,"I'm so sorry you feel this way. I hope you're able to get some relief soon, that sounds really rough. But it's good that you got checked out and ruled out other health issues. It does sound like anxiety. Have you tried anxiety medication? That would likely help with those symptoms so that you can feel normal again."
Anxiety,f25nzbq,t3_dc2wwn,1569979357.0,"Imposter syndrome is the worst. I wish there was a way to get rid of it. I've heard that many people actually feel that way though.

Anxiety,f25ltwc,t3_dbza0f,1569977801.0,"I keep a Xanax in my purse just in case. I've never had to use it but it definitely helps comfort me in case of that happening.

When I feel anxious I do some exercises to try and shake the feeling... Arm circles, squats, lunges etc. Even totally weird stuff like dancing or punching the air like a crazy person, anything to get the adrenaline out.

Obviously I usually do this in the privacy of the bathroom at work, so my coworkers don't think I'm crazy lol.

Also finding a spot to get away to that's not my office helps. Taking a five or ten minute walk outside, to my car or around the building helps me shake the feeling.

But most of all what helps keep the anxiety at bay is staying busy at work. That way my brain doesn't have the time to be anxious."
Anxiety,f25j4vp,t3_dc0umz,1569975857.0,"That happens to me. It's from the adrenaline I think. It's super annoying. Sometimes doing small exercises like jumping jacks or arm circles helps it stop quicker, but sometimes it's just too overwhelming, especially if I get heart palpitations with it."
Anxiety,f1rjj99,t3_damtxu,1569716415.0,"Yeah I love the idea of traveling but it's actually really hard on me because of staying in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Anxiety makes us prefer our safe bubble at home. But, I remind myself that the only way to grow is through uncomfortable situations. It'd be really boring to stay at home every day for our entire lives. 

Anyway that's great that you went to visit your SO's parents and try to let him know how you're feeling so that he can support you. You'll get through this and be back home soon!"
Anxiety,f1nzbad,t3_da3sjq,1569630441.0,"I felt like this when I was younger. Never had friends growing up, was a late bloomer for dating and relationships. I basically did a lot of practicing through online dating (Using OkCupid, I don't know if that's still a thing, this was pre-Tinder). It was mostly failure, but it helped me realize that everyone is pretty weird once you get to know them, not just me. Even though we have anxiety that doesn't mean we're destined to be alone forever, you just haven't found your person yet. But you won't find them if you never put yourself out there. Everyone gets rejected, anxiety just makes it seem so much worse."

Parenting,f1id1o5,t3_d9j7as,1569509005.0,"I ran into this last year with my 9 month old. We would break the routine and do the fun stuff. Sometimes it messed up sleep but the memories were worth it. Your daughter won't remember it, but you will. And she will probably enjoy it in the moment and love looking back at pictures in a few years. Just bring PJs and a night diaper and change her for bed before you head home. 

I actually enjoyed those nights a lot because my guy would tire out and fall asleep easily in the car instead of fighting bedtime! I'm planning to do the same thing this year."
Anxiety,f1d0mvh,t3_d8umig,1569370756.0,"Don't cancel, you got this! If nothing else, going to interviews helps get you better at them! ""Studying"" for interviews always helped me. Have you prepared answers for questions related to the position and other common interview questions? I also like to have a few good questions prepared to ask the interviewer. Maybe that would help? 

Also, if it helps at all, I've been on the interviewing candidates side and stumbling or nerves is never the end of the world. Staying positive and smiling, showing a good attitude matters! And honestly if you blow it, they aren't going to remember it for long. Just do your best! Good luck, I hope you get the job!"
Anxiety,f1a2y8z,t3_d8bhl1,1569284050.0,"I hope you feel better soon, that feeling super sucks. What helps me is usually to do something that puts me in control of my breathing, like have you tried any yoga? It involves focusing on breathing but I've found that it helps with calming after I get into it, and I forget about panicking. There are tons of videos on YouTube, even ones that focus on yoga for anxiety. That or meditation with an app like headspace."
Anxiety,f1a2f3w,t3_d8bqdl,1569283717.0,"This happened to me. It can definitely be an anxiety thing. I was soooo anxious about that exact thing for a few months, but eventually it went away. Seeing an ENT would probably help calm your fears. I see one for my thyroid, and every so often he does an ultrasound to check for any growth. So that's probably the biggest thing that helped to ease my anxiety about it."

Anxiety,ey6s7r6,t3_cvvt35,1566862784.0,"Yeah, I can relate to that. Last time I was really anxious I put an ice pack on my head because I felt hot but then I'd get cold and put a blanket on, and then back to the ice pack and repeat."

There's definitely hope for you to be normal. I never ever thought I'd be a normal person but life has gotten way better after high school. I still get anxiety but I've taken steps to mitigate it and you can too. Don't give up! If you go to college or trade school etc there's so many new people that don't know you and opportunities for new experiences. High school doesn't matter so much once it ends. Things can definitely get better."

Could just be that I've associated the scent with relaxation for bedtime. But if nothing else, diffusing makes your home smell nice!"
Anxiety,exy8isg,t1_exwflc6,1566648725.0,"Yea the drowsiness from those drugs sucks, I take a small dose of 0.25 and still fall asleep sometimes. But I only take it when I need to stop my body from panicking for hours so it's not so bad.

Sometimes exercise or yoga helps me. Getting out of my house and going somewhere calm in nature like a park or the beach usually helps too. If I just stay in my house then the anxiety lasts a lot longer."
Anxiety,exvu660,t3_cuihxg,1566606712.0,"Absolutely - I try not to watch the news or follow politics because of it :( It sucks because it's so stressful seeing so many terrible things happening and not being able to do anything about it.

I'm coping by trying to do as many ""little"" things as I can. I plant trees in my yard, I garden to grow my own food, use less plastic, recycle, I'm saving up for an electric car and solar panels, etc. I'm not single-handedly changing the world but it makes me feel a little better to do what I can."
Anxiety,exvtce6,t3_cul6od,1566606224.0,"I totally get that. My anxiety tends to manifest as physical symptoms like shaking, butterflies in my stomach, stomach pain, nausea, nail biting, feeling out of my head, etc. I'm a really logical person and I can usually talk myself out of worrying but when my body decides to have a panic attack it's a whole other ball game. It gets really annoying because most of the time my mind isn't even worried about something in particular.

Honestly, Xanax has been really helpful since my anxiety is mostly physical. My doctor said that sometimes the body can be triggered easily into that anxiety if it happens too often so taking something like Xanax to stop it can be beneficial."

I contact different vendors (usually by email) to coordinate our media plan. I keep track of projects, assign tasks, route stuff for approval, etc. I think my anxiety is actually really helpful because it makes me double-check a lot of due dates and stay really organized, etc.

Totally would have never seen myself in this position, but I really enjoy it."

When my Kindercare center released their app, they had a form that I signed specifically about permission to share pics if my kid was in them with other parents, if he was in the background etc. I could still get pics of my kid even if I signed it. I chose to allow it because nothing at my center strikes me as nefarious, but I'm surprised a form like this wasn't standard across all centers.

I had to get a marriage license over there and the area is dead except for all the Scientologists in their white shirts, vests and black pants. It always feels like they're watching what you're doing if you're walking around. It's a creepy vibe. Plus they have billboards all over the area advertising their TV channel now and they even ran a local Superbowl ad. It's all really annoying to me, especially since they're tax-exempt, but they're powerful enough to get away with it."

I keep hearing about plans to ""revitalize"" the downtown area but nobody wants to hang out there because of the Scientologists walking around and watching. It's really unsettling and a shame because no doubt that could have been a really cool area if the Scinos weren't lurking in every building."

My 17 month old is exhausting. You couldn't pay me to do this again. I love spending time with him but even the weekends are so tiring with having to entertain him and keep him busy. And bedtime is such a long process to follow his routine for dinner, bath, milk, books... I can't even imagine having to do this stuff for more than one kid. I really miss having hobbies and being able to do my own thing, I'm so tired after he goes to bed that I just veg. 

I'm sure it will get easier when he's older and can do things like have conversations, play games, and go in public while not being a wild animal. And I know I'll miss these days in the future but man it's exhausting to be in the throes of toddlerhood."
