selfharm,fpfidbv,t3_gd5yg5,1588572155.0,I always use soap and water and if you’re up for it use some sort of disinfectant hand sanitizer works. Put some ointment on and bandaids. If it’s bleeding still put some sort of gauze around and on the bandaid and change it every morning and night

My parents (whole family, really) never connected with me. I hope you don’t self harm but I started when I’m as 13 and my mom almost kicked me out the second time she found out I relapsed. You’re goi to make it and the people who you may not think loves you ( friends and such) really do. I’m here anytime to talk to.

writing,fo2ut2f,t3_g55yoh,1587474617.0,"I’m 17, and an avid reader/ writer. The trilogy Scythe has always sat well with me and my friend. We’ve both gotten bored from being in quarantine, and so we’re writing things and being creative together almost every other night. We started planning this story and we were planning on making it a huge thing (try to find a publisher if all goes well). At this point it’s passable as our own story, we based a few characters off of some from the trilogy, but we’ve adapted them to function differently.  This is the only experience I have relating to your question, but from what my friend and I have started writing (it’s been 3 weeks now) I think it’s ok if you’ve taken an idea and made it your own. As though you’ve expanded it and added details and removed some before putting it back together. Judging by our story right now, 70-80% should be original (my personal opinion). I hope this helps"
EatingDisorders,fo2t8me,t3_g5c8s2,1587473502.0,"I’m no expert and I’ve only experienced binging urges my life so I really don’t want to say anything with this much importance. However, I think because it’s occurred with food each time,  your therapist (was it?) sounds like they’re doing what could be best for you at this time. What I wanted to say was that you’re gonna get through this. With patience and the right help, I’m sure you will. Hope you figure it  out!"
EatingDisorders,fo2st1u,t3_g5c8ut,1587473193.0,"Have you brought up these concerns with him (leaving our parts you don’t wish to say to him, of course) it might help him understand what you need from him to help you get better faster.

EatingDisorders,fo2shnf,t3_g59z6x,1587472966.0,"I think getting mad perpetually worsens your relationship and the trust you have regarding the ED’s I really hope your mom and you work this out and yeah, like the other person in the comments said, encourage her to seek help.

EatingDisorders,fo2s3uh,t3_g5ca72,1587472683.0,"I really relate to this. I never finished a meal until grade 5. Everyone was really proud of me, I think we even threw a little celebration. I never ate, I was practically forced to. I’d run around and eating dinner as a child (grade 1-5) took hours. Because I felt so accomplished I guess, I just kept eating. There were points since then where I stopped  eating for days at a time because I thought I could be skinny again.  The past 3 years have been really rough. My depression worsened almost suddenly and my anxiety began to be WORSE than my depression. Eating felt like an escape. Im not over weight, but my body stores fats on my stomach and my neck area so it really became an insecurity of mine in middle school. Since quarantining myself( 4 weeks ago) I’ve gained 2.7kg because I feel like I have to have a hobby or a task at all times and even if I’m watching a movie I’m just so bored but I’m never motivated enough to actually do something other than eat. I keep telling myself “if you don’t eat ____ you’ll be happier” and sometimes I stick to my words. Maybe I’m overreacting to this whole situation and putting labels on things that don’t need them, but binge eating is a problem for me."

It might feel like it’s worse at the beginning of treatment because now you have to tell everything to a person you might be really close with or not at all, but later on it’ll get easier as you feel safe and better with the help you get.
