My grandparents subpump broke last week and we had to go over there in masks to help because my grandfather's house back has been hurting so badly. We could barely talk to him about where important stuff was because we were trying to stay safe. 

Then we found out that at the doctor he went to for his back, there was a worker with Coronavirus. So he's exposed (and at higher risk because he has heart problems, he was in the hospital about a year ago because there was a problem again), as is our grandmother, as is my entire household because we needed to clean up his partially flooded basement.

And then you see people going outside with friends without masks on Snapchat and Instagram. It sucks.

This is basically all I was living for. I don't have anything else to look forward to and all of my time was devoted to this or to school. My blood, sweat, and tears were in the set for those two plays and all of that work was for nothing. 

They added a new competition of a student directed, acted, and produced short film. My brother and his friend wrote one and directed it and I helped along the way. They best two other short films from our school to compete at state. And then if was cancelled.

We hadn't even had a chance to perform the shows. Our only performance was the day after we found out our competitions were cancelled and even then, only one of them performed. It's just been shit. We only get two assured competitions and two nights of public performances through our school, but now we get nothing. I feel so bad for the seniors from my school who won't perform for their last time, for the people who didn't get to perform AT ALL because they first got into a competition show as a senior. 

This was my life and it was all for nothing. I cried and cried because of this, I got hurt so many times because of this, and it was for nothing."
