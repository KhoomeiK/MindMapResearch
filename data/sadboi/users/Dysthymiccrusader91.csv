So one way to think is your brain only has so many colors to work with and so much space on a page when it is creating the image of your day

You experience so much at any moment, it is not possible to really take down every detail, so you pick and choose, usually filling in some basic ideas

So your brain is like a big coloring book, and the black an white is usually based on ideas you grew up with and how we are taught things work.

Now, when you are overwhelmed, or you have lot of bad experiences, your brain uses a stress color, we'll call it cortisol blue, and just covers the page quickly because you feel in danger. Having blue already over your brain makes it harder for the other colors to stand out, and suddenly everything just feels blue, and you feel like there's nothing more to add.

So, medication, diet, and getting enough sleep can help your brain use more colors and panic less, exercise or meditation can give your brain more time to paint the picture you want, talk therapy can help you understand the lines you start with and maybe change them, and all these things contribute to a healthier picture.

Maybe the most important idea is that it's okay if you're feeling blue, because you always wake up with a new page to work with, an that idea alone can change your mood and perspective.

mentalhealth,fixubq5,t3_fag2hb,1582826832.0,The protip is to call your insurance or go on their website and ask for mental health treatment providers in your network. They have to evaluate to treat.
mentalhealth,fiwx92n,t3_fab4pe,1582806547.0,"So I think it's entirely reasonable that either a) nothing additional happened beyond the event you referenced, but the thought of that type of tragedy led to increased re-experiencing symptoms pursuant to your ptsd experience. 

It's also feasible b) that's things could happen and you disassociate as a defense mechanism. Reactions to stress can include loss of time, panic attacks, or even seizures.

In either event, I wouldn't say the intervention you take day to day needs to be any different. You can still recognize that PTSD is basically your body pulling a fire alarm every time someone lights a candle. It leads to physical manifestations that you can learn to control."
mentalhealth,fiwusdr,t3_faapey,1582803929.0,"Indeed, you nee an opportunity to sit down and really explore your thoughts, and identify your triggers. Also recognize, you are talking lots of sugar and carbs, which are very addictive.

The craving and the anxiety are very physical reactions that with exercise like you're used to, o meditation, or even medication you can help control, but you'll need to talk work to better identify what sort of starts the process"
AskReddit,fitmm7m,t3_f9t9rk,1582724362.0,"Bloomberg could literally fix the housing homeless and overall issue of social determinents in the new York City area by building his own damn city, at benefit to him, because money invested in social programs yields bigger dividends in city state an local revenue.

And he isn't. Not has he. He is a dude with resources to address a multitude of problems spend millions in adds to promise to address problems. 

If an election is a question of what would someone do with power, Bloomberg answered already. Jack shit. 

Personally I feel my ideal candidate would be an immortal Jimmy Carter if that gives you context. Dude is still building housing and investing in green energy. Meanwhile the Bronx is full of crumbling apartments and a crippled transportation system and Bloomberg is waving his dick around in the Carolinas."

One, com into school clad in solely rainbow flags and teddy bears and offer to kiss the bully

Or

Just keep on bro high school is full of stupid shit like that. I doubt the bully is secretly working with the government to identify questioning teens."

As a thought exercise, you can imagine how your life would be different if you were born the opposite, to address the why does it matter.

Environmentally, the United States in general has a brutal social dichotomy stretching back to it's founding. In or out, black or white, man or woman, Republican or Democrat, gay or straight, all boils to right or wrong. As the effects of this schema continue I think more and more don't fit neatly into the institutional image modern media would make for them.

When I say media, I don't mean the news. News papers, cartoons, movies, radio, advertising, all information is influenced by trying to sell a certain image that I becoming increasingly disconnected from the realities of the audience. I think there are two reasons, one being increased communication of ideas (reddit) and the other that the top 10 richest people have basically been the same families influencing media for the last hundred years.

Way to long I know. Ask someone who is questioning what life is like for them. Bound to be a subreddit for it."
mentalhealth,fisjf5t,t3_f9kgkr,1582685984.0,"I mean licensing standards are intense in New York state. You'll have to see. You at least want to be connected so you don't run out of meds.

Not that I want you to be in this position, but know, being in a severe manic episode, very impulsive, unable to function, especially if it includes risk taking or suicidal ideation, IS a reason to admit inpatient for psychiatric observation. They have to connect you before they discharge you. 9-1-1 is that number. That's a last resort but know it's an option."

When you say new York City, so you mean Manhattan or another borough? 

The best advice is usually to go on your Insurance website or call the customer number. Ask them who is in network, or it usually has a way to select a service and enter a zip code. That way the list you get is definitely covered providers.

Finally, I'd recommend like looking on YouTube for a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. Usually these are 5-10 minutes and are great ways to counter panic attacks.

You can actually call 718-920-2256 which is Montefiore medical group's relaxation hotline. It's literally an answering machine, totally free. You can hit 1 for English and then press 5. Great with headphones, totally usable on a bus or if you have to hide in a restroom at work for a few minutes."
