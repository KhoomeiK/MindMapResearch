marriageadvice,fp8xufx,t3_gby6oe,1588406820.0,"Here's my take on this. I go through the same exact thing with my husband over the last few years. He is terrible at gift giving in general. Gift giving and acts of service are my love language while his is touch and quality time.
His lack of forethought into my needs during times where gifts are traditional hurt. I've been without gifts for my birthday, Christmas and mother's day basically since we were married. When I was pregnant on mother's day I got a sticker that said baby on board. I don't like those stickers, I think they're tacky.. he knew that too.
It caused us so many fights, so many days of me thinking I'd come home to something special so many times and being disappointed. 
We have always had difficulty with keeping regular sex. Problems from my past make it difficult for me to always initiate and want to follow through. When he told me not long ago that our relationship wouldn't last if I didn't try to amend our problem I felt a few things.
One was surpise that I realized he maybe didn't know how I felt about gifts and I could use that as an analogy.
Two, I could be pissed that he thinks only his needs matter or he's really dense.
Three, both of us need to work on our communication to get our needs heard. 

So you can take what you will from this.
Sex is better but I don't expect a gift on mother's day. I doubt the thought even entered his brain. I've come to accept that I won't get gifts from him. It's a sacrifice I make to keep our relationship going because other than a few small things, our marriage is pretty stellar. He's my rock and a great father to our kids. If serious crap goes down I can count on him to be there to help and keep me grounded when I start to panic.

It's 4 am and I'm not sure this is quite coherent but if anything I hope you know there's some solidarity here.
Hopefully you can figure out what you can accept and what you can't and go forward with firm and precise boundaries with those choices. 
All the best."

AttachmentParenting,fk635h6,t3_fggdgb,1583892748.0,"My 4 year old has a twin bed on the side of our king. I have a bed gate in between both beds with the twin against the wall. Baby sleeps on the king next to the gate, I sleep next to him and then my husband on the outside. If the 4 year old needs cuddles, he gets in-between my husband and I. 4 year old throws punches in his sleep, so I have to separate him from the baby at all times. It mostly works out and if 4 year old is too crazy, either my husband or I move him back to the twin. 
It helps having the 4 year old so close. He has nightmares when alone and will wake up in a panic. If he sees us in the king, he usually will go back to sleep knowing we're close.
This is the gate.

AskReddit,fk2vi0c,t1_fk1mtll,1583810166.0,I'm assuming my supervisor at the coffee shop I with at had a similar experience. He asked if I'd mopped before having me do it. We work with a ton of young adults so I get it but it was still kind of funny.
