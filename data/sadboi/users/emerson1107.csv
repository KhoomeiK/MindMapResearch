schizophrenia,fditxck,t3_elkk75,1578450957.0,"If you are a woman who is attracted to men, I don't think that you would necessarily have a hard time with finding someone to date and getting married. First of all, the dating market and gender norms make this pretty easy. People are also more afraid of a man with schizophrenia being violent than they are of a woman with schizophrenia being violent. There is also less of an expectation that a woman will always have a job, so you're less likely to run into issues with your partner demanding that you hold a job even when you're unwell. I think that if you are a nice person who is dating a nice person, marriage is very feasible. People need to feel appreciated by their partner. I used to have issues with emotional regulation and this interfered with relationships, but I worked on it with dialectical behavioral therapy and it doesn't interfere so much now. I'm pretty sure a good predictor of a relationship lasting is whether two people can feel \~not on edge\~ around each other. So I think that being nice is really helpful for having a lasting relationship, but still, you can be a nice person and have trouble regulating emotions, and this can bring out your mean side. I think that marriage and long-term relationships can be really good for a person with schizophrenia, because if you find someone nice, they can support you, and talking to them can keep you more grounded in reality. 

I have a schizophrenia diagnosis and am not even that good looking (I look like what I am: a nerd with developmental issues), but finding a boyfriend was pretty easy for me. My relationship with him has been pretty chill, and he lives a similar lifestyle with respect to wanting to study all the time and do mentally demanding things like math & computer science, and like me, he is not super romantic like some of my exes. He is nice and nonjudgmental and stable and smart, and he just graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor's degree in computer science and is starting a Master's.... so, if we stick it out, we will not be poor, even if I don't work. However, I prefer to work and will do so whenever possible, and he is supportive of that. But it is nice to know that if something goes wrong with my employment, I won't be screwed, and he won't be either. It's good if you can meet someone at school or somewhere else that you can meet someone responsible, functional, and smart that you have things in common with. I struggled with suicidal thoughts at your age, and eventually I got to a point where I could avoid thinking about suicide and just focus on my life, but now, suicide doesn't even appeal to me when I think about it. I've got things to look forward to, friends to say hi to, math problems to solve, classes to take, hobbies to pursue, places I want to travel to, food I want to eat, etc. I'd like to someday write a book, and eventually have kids... My boyfriend thinks I would be a good parent. I don't want to have a kid until about 11 years from now though. I plan on adopting because I just don't want to go through being pregnant for 9 months and giving birth when there are plenty of children who need homes anyway.

That happened to me when my episode was starting and I think because no one was willing to see the distinction, eventually I was just like ""fine, I believe it."" 

I think you're right that it's not really a ""delusion"" per se, but for me it was the first step in developing my delusions, and I personally try to stop myself long before the delusion part. What's more worrisome is when it turns into thinking you have an ability to read people's minds and stuff... That's basically what my whole delusional worldview was about. I thought I was communicating with hundreds of powerful people subliminally and telepathically by means of various codes, and the cognition involved with that was basically like an explosion of habitually reading into things people say, wear, do, post, etc. It happened gradually and then all at once. I found I would read into things people say because I was lonely and I wanted my conversations to mean more than they did, and that turned into finding a way to believe that conversations that weren't about me actually did involve me, and then turning things that weren't even conversations into conversations involving me.

It's been a bumpy few weeks. I think it's partly because my diet has been bad around the holidays and the gym has been closed a lot. I am feeling a little edgy but not anything I don't think exercise and diet won't help. 

But I took the GRE and did well, and overshot the threshold I needed for admission to the Mathematics MS program at my home institution by a lot. Unofficial score of 161 for verbal and 167 for quantitative, which is good enough for pretty much anywhere, since people don't really care about General GRE scores anyway. I got three solid letter writers for my grad school application who said they'd be happy to recommend me and one that says that I have ""plenty of talent"" for mathematics grad school... I've got two recommenders who are full professors who study pure mathematics, and a philosophy professor. I was pretty relieved to find out that the would do it and say nice things, since asking for letters of rec can be pretty scary when you've had all sorts of mental weirdness going on for the past few years.

I had one try some light conversion therapy on me... at the time I'm like 16 years old and therapy consists of being made to look at shirtless male movie stars. Your current therapist might be able to refer you to someone who might be a better fit. It seems like good therapists usually know of some other good therapists. But I guess if switching isn't an option, it might be good to talk to her about it. I think just being very descriptive like you have here about your thought process and when you see someone mirroring you. I feel like trying to get some distance and describe your thought process, as well as the ways that you doubt the thought process might help. I've confronted a few people about my delusional thinking and the ways I thought they were involved in my delusions, and I think that if you try to be as clinical and descriptive of your thought process as you can, showing that you are not fully committed to believing your thoughts, it will be easier to have a productive conversation about it, particularly because she is a therapist."
schizophrenia,fclnv5p,t3_ehu2j5,1577752200.0,"I've never known people to actually do subtle things like that to ""tell someone something,"" although I have often had the delusion that they were, and then later realized that it was one of the things that went away when delusions went away. Like slick\_villain\_bob (nice username) mentioned, sometimes people are just empathetic and mirror you. I have really tried to get more comfortable with this without reading into it, because being comfortable with mirroring is a part of developing friendships. I used to try to never have anything in common with people and then wondered why I didn't have friends.

But if your therapist triggers these types of thoughts for you, I think she is probably not the right therapist for you. Some people are a lot better at not giving off those subliminal message vibes, and I think it's good to keep those more straightforward people close if you're feeling vulnerable to reading into things. I also think it is not good to be attracted to your therapist, because I think it can lead you to misrepresent your symptoms around them, or even try to be mentally ill in a sexy way, which in my case usually ends up being not that sexy.... haha. The Freudian values of not censoring yourself in therapy become much more difficult to abide by productively.

Thank you for your openness on here though... it helps me to think about this as someone else's problem. I really do think it might be better to get a new therapist, one who seems very straightforward and un-mysterious and that you don't feel interested in whether they were to subtly flirt with you. I think that it's good to have a therapist that models literalistic uncomplicated emotions and thinking. I think my therapist right now is a good fit, because he's nice in a very platonic-seeming way; he is friendly and cares and stuff, but you don't get the feeling that there's anything personal about it, which is actually good for a therapist. He's just a huge nerd who likes to geek out about all the psychology books he's read and help me come up with solutions. I feel like I am able to present my issues in a more constructive way, because it's more about fixing my problems and developing self-compassion than trying to make a connection. Not saying you should always avoid people like your therapist, but I think it's helpful if the main person you are problem-solving mental health issues with helps you to establish that baseline of non-delusional thought.

schizophrenia,fckryb6,t3_ehnyyc,1577731895.0,"Definitely the meds. I used to be on Invega Sustenna, and I felt really stupid on it, like my mind was in a straitjacket. Like you, my mind was blank all the time. I am honestly amazed that you are on like the highest dose of Invega Sustenna, plus another antipsychotic, a relatively high dose of benzos, and an antihistamine! Benzos and antihistamines are terrible for memory individually, and together... I just feel bad for you. 

When I was on Invega Sustenna, I would struggle and struggle to come up with a simple question to ask someone so that hopefully they would start talking and not want to hear anything from me, because I had absolutely nothing to say. It was a constant struggle to come up with a single thought. I totally totally relate to not being able to watch TV due to not being able to follow what was going on. It took me about three months after getting my last injection of Invega Sustenna and then using Cerebrolysin to regenerate brain cells before I felt like I was actually ""watching"" TV again rather than just sitting with my front towards the TV. 

Weirdly enough, it is difficult for me to imagine how it felt to be on Invega Sustenna now that I am not taking it, because it was such an unnatural feeling. It was like being trapped in my own brain... I want to think but I can't think... I want to panic but I can't panic... it felt very claustrophobic. It didn't help that the antihistamines prescribed for extrapyramidal symptoms made me feel like I had no past because they made me forget my life. I forgot that I went to Hawaii two years before. My dad was like ""remember when we went snorkeling in Kauai?"" and I was like ""I don't remember that."" And it was like all of my memories of my past were just a dozen isolated snapshots. The only things that I could remember were the things that I had recalled over and over again, which left enough for me to seem outwardly human, but internally, it felt like most of my brain and life experience was missing, because there was just nothing between the few things that have been imprinted on my mind permanently, like the 1000 most common English words, and a finite number of important memories."

schizophrenia,fciw1br,t3_ehcrmw,1577671170.0,"It sounds like you've been very patient with your dad and put a lot of effort into being supportive of him. I always like seeing posts from people like you, because I can tell that you are doing your best to support your family member and be nonjudgmental and non-stigmatizing. 

Unfortunately, as far as I know, it's basically impossible to directly get someone to change their delusions through argumentation or talking about the delusions, since delusional beliefs usually involve a very complex and compelling internal reward system. Since formation of beliefs heavily involves the dopamine system, ramping up delusions can become like an addiction where the only thing standing between the person and getting their ""fix"" is their own thoughts. Arguing with someone about their delusion is likely to result in the ""backfire effect,"" where if you try to bring up contradictory evidence, they will only dig their heels in harder by looking for more evidence for their side of things. People with psychosis can use reason to unravel their delusions, but that often requires a conscious decision to no longer believe in the delusions. I think I eventually decided that my delusions were not worth it and then proceeded to ""brainwash"" myself into no longer believing them, and I think it worked pretty well. 

I think the best thing that you can do is try to provide a stable environment, or at least one stable relationship for your family member. When giving them food, provide them with healthy food low in sugar and chemically processed ingredients. Try to encourage any remaining interests they may have in things other than their delusions, talk to them about regular stuff even though they may not seem that interested in it, and try to lower your ""expressed emotion"" towards the family member. Expressed emotion of the individual's family has a significant effect on relapse rates. By expressed emotion, I specifically mean excessive criticism, hostility, and emotional over-involvement, e.g. like acting like it's all your fault that they are ill and being overprotective of them or taking things they say overly personally. 

I think another important thing is to incentivize paying attention to real life by encouraging his interests and engagement with things in the real world, through things like friendships, exercise, hobbies, housework, work-work, or volunteering if he is able to do something like that, or maybe even TV, depending on which shows you watch and whether his delusions seem to be triggered by watching TV or specific shows or commercials. Furthermore, it is helpful to deincentivize receding into a delusional mindset by providing a stable environment where he has fewer instances of severe emotional distress due to uncertainty, criticism, and conflict. Something I've heard about addiction, is that when a person gets sober, they need an enriching life to return to, especially one that is incompatible with the addiction, so that sober life seems more appealing than being drunk or high. I think it's similar with delusions; he needs to be engaged with life in an at least somewhat enriching way in order to no longer care for his delusions.

Feelings of boredom and emptiness are common with borderline as well. It's a really terrible label to get slapped on your forehead, but the good news is that dialectical behavioral therapy is extremely helpful for the symptoms.

On one hand, I have had a lot of people say that I'm smart, and then a lot of people seem surprised when I do well academically or get high scores on tests. I am 25, and I'm soon going to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Philosophy and start a Master's in Mathematics. I think that you would have to be very intelligent and introspective to be able to put your concerns so articulately, especially at your age. I don't think I would have been so perceptive. 

Something I wish I would have done at your age is become more involved with theater and debate, so that I could gain more experience in controlling the way I express myself through speech and body language. I've seen theater do wonders for introverted people, but unfortunately when I was your age, I thought that being morose and withdrawn my whole life would be fine, so I didn't push myself to get better at theater. I think that if you do theater and debate during high school, starting early as a freshman, you will be quite self-assured by time you get to college, at least relative to the person you would have been. 

I would also like to encourage you to get some experience with computer programming, since that is one job where an intelligent introvert could play to their strengths, and pretty much any career would be benefited by some knowledge of programming. However, there is a real bias against quiet people in any field, and it sucks. And any job you work in basically will require you to work with people and be self-assured. If you feel that people are treating you as if you're stupid, please be kind to yourself and know that you are capable and intelligent. But also know that the sooner you try to practice ""coming out of your shell,"" the easier it will be to seem intelligent and confident when you're older. Please please please be kind to yourself. There might be some rough times when you try to put yourself out there more, and it can be difficult to see the big picture at your age, but just keep trying to be social and improve your confidence and presentation of yourself. It really makes a difference in people's careers, even unfortunately the ones where more introspective deep thinkers are needed. Try to make some good friends who you can talk to if you go through some difficulty in developing confidence. You are very intelligent, and I hope that you are able to make the most of that intelligence."

I think part of the trick is to not get so upset about perceived failures that you feel the need to escape with delusions, and also to not let successes go to your head and also turn into delusions. I try to focus on successes that are measurable and observable, while also not getting beat up about when I don't do too well in any measurable way. I also try to be wary of thinking that I've gotten good at something without deliberately practicing it for an extraordinary amount of time and with an enormous amount of focus, because effective practice both helps you to get better at something and makes you more aware of what needs to improve. I try to focus on the mere acts of showing up, doing something, meeting ""Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound"" or ""SMART"" goals. I don't necessarily know if I'm doing great at life, but I am doing much better than I have in the past, and I've been self-sabotaging less because of my fears related to stress, failure, and success."

I don't know if you should encourage your friend to take Adderall. I think the number one priority for your friend would be to keep the psychosis symptoms under control. However, if he is already on an antipsychotic, the Adderall would largely get canceled out, and probably not be too dangerous. I found that while I was on an antipsychotic, Adderall actually seemed to help me with my insomnia. But about a year ago, I quit my antipsychotic, so I decided to get off of Adderall too.

The first time was when I was about 16 and I had a huge crush on this girl from church (I am female and we were both raised Mormon), and I started feeling like I was thought-broadcasting about how I was in love with her. I honestly was a bit stalker-y and obsessive, but refused to try to take things in a physical direction. That one was probably the worst one as far as out-of-control crushes go. It seems like every time I have a crush on someone, I am more jaded than the time before about the crush, but the psychosis symptoms are worse. When I was a complete zombie on invega sustenna, I started dating someone I didn't feel like I was that into because I had certain preconceived notions about what types of people I get along with, but it has been one of the happiest and most peaceful relationships I've had. Just remember that the psychosis-crushes are kind of bullshit and you can just admire the person for a minute and then get over it. Maybe try to think about things that would be annoying or unattractive about them if you were in a relationship with them. Like imagine them farting with a bunch of potato chip crumbs on their shirt. Or if you're students, focus on what they look like during finals week.

If you really can't find anyone who's heard from him, probably try talking to the police or someone with the Department of Public Safety about your concern about him being missing. I am sure that they would take it seriously. I think that when someone needs medical assistance or has a mental or physical impairment, there is a lower bar for deciding that they are ""missing."" Definitely try to frame it as you being concerned for your step brother's safety and let them know about your step brother's paranoia about cops, so that hopefully no one will automatically treat him like a criminal.

I was a recitation leader for a statistics class this semester and just got course evaluations... they were pretty bad. One comment I got a lot in the course evaluations was that the way I explained things was difficult to follow, and another one was that I was too quiet and timid (although the comment about me being timid was phrased very nicely). It's kind of frustrating feeling like I've made these great strides in my ability to talk with and interact with people, but apparently it's barely sufficient for people who are really nice and patient and definitely not good enough for those who are less patient. My students largely did not like my recitation, and I think the main problem was my speaking ability (and the fact that I was a recitation leader for one of my least favorite classes I'd taken that's not even a part of my major), which is a pretty sensitive topic for me since I've had so many bad experiences related to people judging my speaking ability.

I was really happy to have the job, regardless of it being one of the classes I most notably disliked, but I hope to God I'd be able to do better as a recitation leader for a class I liked and was good at, and that in this case I would be able to speak confidently and clearly. I don't think I will get fired, but I am still sort of worried about it, and I'm worried that I'll be in trouble. By the way, your writing seems very skillful and well put-together."

I had a terrific memory pretty far into my prodromal symptoms, but after the anticholinergics, I like couldn't remember my childhood friends' names or that I went to Hawaii two years before and stuff like that. I definitely recommend stopping the anticholinergics ASAP to anyone who's taking them. They can be slightly addictive in my experience and they can even make psychosis worse"

schizophrenia,f0wyc0c,t3_d70b57,1569016533.0,"I used to have a lot of delusions that people I knew were stalking me. It was a really difficult delusion to shake. I had the delusion long before my first ""real"" psychotic episode. How to deal with the situation might depend on this person's particular triggers. Whatever you do, don't yell at them. That will screw them up worse and probably result in them elaborating on their delusions about you. I'd imagine that the simplest solution would be to just not go to the cafe anymore. But of course, great places to study are not always easy to come by. I honestly think if you act weird around the person, that will make the delusions worse. If you keep showing up there and stonewall them when they say hi to you, they will probably be more suspicious. A lot of delusions are driven by loneliness and trying to cover up the pain of rejection.  

Sometimes if my friend with schizophrenia accuses me of something, I look them in the eyes and nonjudgmentally ask them if that is what they really think. Sometimes they'll respond ""haha, no it was a joke."" I don't know if it will help you, but I've never had much of a problem with psychotic people. Most psychotic people are not dangerous. The increased risk of violence only comes into play when the individual abuses drugs or alcohol, and that's the same for non-psychotic people. 

For almost 7 years, I thought that this one high school teacher I had was stalking me. Honestly, I was sort of stalking *him*. Nothing illegal; not actually stalking him in person, but internet stalking him, because I thought I could tell he was stalking me from his social media posts. I think that if he had deleted his twitter account and gotten a new one, the delusions would have gone away on their own. But when I got medicated for my first psychotic episode, the stalking delusion went away with all of the super extreme delusions I had. I've been off my meds for a year on October 1st, and the delusions haven't come back (meaning, I don't believe that anyone is stalking me anymore.)"
schizophrenia,eyusrbs,t3_cyfv76,1567471170.0,"I feel this. Sorry to hear it.

I try not to get too hung up on it though because it just makes me miserable. I think the main thing that's important is that you're talking to people every day. It doesn't have to be the same person all the time. Having a significant other does help with getting my daily dose of socializing. I used to compare my social life to my sister's or my more social romantic partners' or people who are posting photos of them with their besties and just wonder why I couldn't make close friends. I do feel like it was partly this loneliness that triggered my delusions because I just wanted to feel like people secretly cared about me even though they weren't interacting with me on a regular basis. 

The truth is, I probably won't ever know why I don't easily develop close friends, but hopefully I won't have to go to my grave sore about it because I'm assuming people think I'm a monster. I just tell myself that my social life is totally normal as long as it is healthy for me and I am not withdrawing from people, because acting like there is something lacking from my social life is a big part of what makes it painful. I try to just focus on socializing every day and not worry about whether my social life represents the ideal archetype of a social life. As it turns out, some neurotypical people have social lives much like mine where they are friends or good acquaintances with people at school but don't really have any super close friends. 

Schizophrenia is really effective people repellent, but I honestly felt like people leaving me alone after my psychotic episode was a blessing in disguise. Not because it's good to be isolated, but because I feel like it was some of the people I was interacting with that exacerbated my psychotic symptoms. I no longer had to take care of anyone or deal with people who didn't respect my time. Needy people just disappeared from my life. But I am super scared to tell people about my schizophrenia diagnosis because usually when I tell people they act all nice and understanding, and then for some reason we don't talk anymore. But maybe it just feels that way and friendships just ebb and flow in that way and it doesn't really have much to do with my diagnosis. 

TL;DR

Don't worry about it. Just focus on socializing in whatever way you can and try to cultivate healthy relationships whether they are close ones or not."

I don't know how it is where you live or with your therapist, but I had no problems with just outright telling my therapist I stopped taking my medication. 

It totally pisses me off when psychiatrists, psych nurses, etc., claim that the side effects of the medication are due to the illness. I had some cognitive impairment from my psychosis and sleep deprivation during psychosis, but it was completely different from the cognitive impairment I had on the medication.

This situation honestly scares me a little bit... keeping a mentally ill family member holed up and isolated from people like a rabid dog. It's not right to sweep people under the rug like that. Isolation is really bad for people with schizophrenia. He needs to be talking to people so that he knows that there are people who see the world differently than he does. Isolation always makes my symptoms worse and it is bad for well-being in general even for people who want to be isolated.

Just talk to him about regular stuff and try to not criticize him too much or get angry at him, because that could be triggering. I found it really helpful to talk to my neighbor because his way of thinking was just so incompatible with my delusions. It helped that the way he had conversations was very casual, but he was still willing to talk with me. When people made a big deal out of having a conversation with me, it sort of fed my delusions."

Honestly, my sex drive hasn't completely returned to normal yet, but it's actually nice because I pretty much only think about sex when I'm having sex, so it's not as distracting. Try to take advantage of anything you can learn from being in a different mental state. I think being on Invega Sustenna made me realize that my life doesn't need to be so complicated.

schizophrenia,ewimbma,t3_co89qd,1565452321.0,"I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and I am doing pretty well. I've been actively trying to improve and work on my counterproductive behaviors, reading all sorts of psychology books and articles. I changed about a million things about my lifestyle: started exercising more, showering more, keeping on top of housework and laundry, eating healthier, started spending time with more stable people, got rid of my smartphone and got a flip phone, deleted my Facebook and Twitter, tried to work on my social skills and have warmer interactions with people without oversharing, and many other things. I think that focusing on the mundane stuff and trying to get my life under control helped a lot. I read that people are more likely to perceive illusory patterns when they lack a sense of control, so I try to maintain control over the mundane things in my life. It also helps me to feel competent and normal to do those things. Also, I don't see trying to be normal as an oppressive standard. I was a lot more stressed out thinking I had to be special.

It was easier to pursue hobbies after I minimized technology's influence over my attention. It was also easier to focus on school. I got a 4.0 last semester, and I retook 3 courses this summer, and another 4.0 seems highly likely (2 A's so far, and I'm waiting for a grade on a final exam which I just needed a C+ on to get an A in the class). I will probably graduate with my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Philosophy in about a year. I've also been successfully working part-time this summer. I've had good personal hygiene, haven't been late to work, I've had very few minor interpersonal conflicts, and I think I've been relatively well-liked and competent at work. I've been off meds for about 10 months... doesn't work for everybody, but with all the lifestyle changes I've made, I've been fine off of meds so far and actually more functional than I was before my psychotic episode. I haven't had symptoms of my illness for about 9 months. I'm less psychotic than I was even as a teenager (I'm 24 now.) I'm living with my boyfriend, and that helps with rent and other bills, and he also helps with the housework, but I think I pull my own weight cleaning up after myself, taking care of all of my laundry, and cooking food sometimes. I don't live independently, but I don't think my boyfriend considers me a burden or thinks of himself as my caretaker.

Best of luck to you and your sister.

socialskills,euyd7pj,t3_chphm8,1564100010.0,"I can totally relate. Try it out; some people will respond well and others won't. I just talked to someone the other day whom I've purposefully ignored out of shame during a rough time. It seemed like he hadn't noticed I'd been avoiding being friendly in the past and we had a great conversation. They might understand that sometimes you're in the mood to talk and sometimes you're not. You can start to be more friendly gradually, like by saying hi to them when you run into them or asking them how they've been doing. Ask them questions about themselves, find things you have in common, share your thoughts and opinions and information they might find interesting. I had to work on being vulnerable while not oversharing. I feel like friendships are much less anxiety-inducing if I try to only very gradually tell them personal things about myself. People like you to be a little vulnerable, but you can get too close too quick. I think it's best to start with sharing a vulnerability that is fairly common or humorous, and wait until you've hung out several times or more to share things about diagnoses, mental hospitals, weird shit done while psychotic, deepest darkest secrets, etc.

edit: Also, try to act happy to see the friends. If you seem happy to see them, they will begin to feel happy to see you too. Don't let embarrassment, worry, or shame make you seem like you don't like them.

schizophrenia,euswnfx,t3_ch80cu,1564015060.0,"If something doesn't stick very long in your mind after you read it, try looking away from the page and trying to recall what you read just after reading a page. Active recall is one of the most effective study strategies out there. Try to quiz yourself and actively remember things as much as you can.

Don't be intimidated by the idea of getting straight A's. Getting straight A's gives me a sense of control that I find extremely therapeutic. Research has even shown that people are more likely to perceive illusory patterns (i.e. experience delusions and hallucinations) when they lack a sense of control. If you go to class and complete and turn in every assignment on time, I guarantee you will get good grades. Going to class is extremely important, and not going to class is strongly correlated with failing grades. I used to get terrible grades, but I realized that I have never gotten lower than an A- in a class where I turned everything in and attended class. Turn every single assignment in on time. If the professor offers to grade late assignments, take the offer with a grain of salt because if you turn things in late, you will get behind and become overwhelmed. Start early so that you don't stress about it. Procrastination -> time crunch crises -> panic attacks -> worsened psychotic symptoms. I got perfect grades last semester taking 5 classes (4.0 in the US) and it looks like I'm headed for another 4.0 this summer. I am much less stressed out than I used to be and my full remission is going strong. I also tried to get done with everything before 5pm so that I had time to relax, exercise, do chores, etc.

Try to give up the identity of being a procrastinator. I used to think that I was a fundamentally disorganized person, among other things, and that it was just the way things were. But it turned out that some of those behaviors I didn't want to change like procrastinating, not managing my time, not showering, etc. were actually major sources of stress for myself.

Be sure to put a lot of thought into your plan to stay organized and on top of schoolwork. Make it simple and streamlined and convenient to implement. Make rules for yourself and remember that building discipline is like building a muscle. I have a lot more to say about it, but I feel like pretty much any good advice for succeeding in school is good advice for succeeding in school as a schizophrenic. Your school probably offers a class on study skills, and if they do, I highly recommend taking it. I took the one at my school, and it helped me a lot even though I took it after being in college for 5 years. I'm studying math and philosophy and used to study biology, so I know some strategies for a variety of subjects, so PM me if you have any specific questions. Discipline, organization, and time management are the three most important things though, even or especially for a schizophrenic. I know a lot of people with schizophrenia struggle with those things, but I think it's a chicken-or-the-egg thing. I personally think improving your organization, discipline, and time management will help a lot with your stress and in turn help with your symptoms.

Edit: I'm also almost done and super excited about it. One more year."

While I often feel the urge to withdraw from socializing, I find that having frequent conversations with other people helps me to stay grounded in reality. While there are people who seem to make my psychosis worse (high expressed emotion people), my psychosis tends to get significantly worse at times when I've been isolated for a while, such as over summer break when I am not in school, or after a breakup. I think living on your own might be a good opportunity to entertain friends and invite the right people into your life.

I don't think it's fair to force every single person with schizophrenia to stay on them forever and risk heart disease, obesity, diabetes, heart attack, and tardive diskinesia. But they did provide me some relief for about a week, before the side effects from being over-medicated got so bad that I just wanted to go back to being terrified, and on them, I got my level of delusional thought to a level lower than it had been maybe in my entire life. I never would have been able to see things from such a sobered vantage point without them. But I sure as hell do not want to be on them forever."
