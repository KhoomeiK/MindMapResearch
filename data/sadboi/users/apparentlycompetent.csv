What helped me was planning for the inevitable anxiety, depression, mood swings, just general mental illness flairs that would interfere with my plans. I made realistic goals for my travel and sight-seeing. If I didn't get to something on my itinerary I didn't beat myself up about it. I did my research on the areas I stayed in. I made sure I had enough meds, knew who to contact if I needed help, etc. I stayed in touch with my therapist and made arrangements to speak with him if needed. That REALLY helped.

More importantly I try and bring mindful awareness to the moments when I could get stuck in a plucking cycle, but can intervene before it gets bad.

As an example, at work my boss can be a bit old school. I work with college students and my boss took a hard line against ""short"" shorts as part of the dress code even in the dead heat of summer. It was ridiculous. I had made a point (without openly arguing because she would have doubled down on her opinion) how it's impossible to find shorts that go just above the knees like what she was thinking - at least for young women (indirectly trying to change her mind). As I explained this I made jokes, put on the charm, and said what I needed to in a way that changed her perception of what short shorts are (underhanded). I even brought in a pair of my own shorts and put them on for her to see.

BPD,fqgdjjy,t3_giqd2a,1589343552.0,"There's no explicit guide to this kind of stuff, but a good rule of thumb is thinking about how you would feel if the tables were turned. I get it, I'm afraid of hurting people closest to me, too. I always have been, even when I couldn't control my mood swings and other BPD symptoms. When I was a teenager I struggled with lashing out at my parents. I said horrible things to my mom in the highs and lows of my ever shifting mood, it was awful. Awful for all my family. If I had been treated that way I would have called it emotional abuse - like emotionally abusive verbal lashings. But I've worked really hard to better myself, make amends, and actively cope and communicate now when issues come up. That's the best thing you can do. My parents say it's why they have so much respect for me and they always appreciate that I work hard in therapy. My advice is, be empathetic with how other people on the receiving end of your actions might feel. Especially if it's behaviors stemming from symptoms - fear of abandonment used to be a big one for me that would cause conflicts. And keep working on yourself. Work to be better for other people. That's all you can do, really. Because you're already self aware and concerned and that's the first step.

Edit: the gamechanger for me was learning to talk about this stuff with my parents and brother, and friends too. It's hard to discuss this illness! Especially, like for me, it's the opposite of who I am as a person, in my soul. But learning to put words to behaviors, and learning the ""why"" of why I acted the way I did was invaluable. Turns out the people who care about you usually want to know this stuff so they can support you. When you have good people around you they want to help you be good."

I didn't go deep into research, just that I sounded interesting and some of the criteria matches. I had a good relationship with my therapist, I had been seeing her for two years. She got out the DSM and we kept a tally of the criteria that fit. And I was diagnosed with BPD. 

People get their diagnoses in a ton of different ways. But it starts with communication first. Could you try talking to her about it plainly?

Edit: and as you know diagnoses are important for labels which is important to get the right treatment. BPD is primarily treated with DBT so you could look into that. There's resources as line. DBT is great for anybody so you can learn to hone skills to help manage. It makes a huge difference."
BPD,fqb5y8f,t3_ghty73,1589231157.0,">I don't like that we work so hard to keep them alive. I don't like that they ask for things. I don't like that they need so much help. I can't stand how much they talk. 

Like another user said, I'm glad you know this thinking is problematic. I'm curious - the things I highlighted, have you ever disliked those things about yourself? Sometimes people project their self-hatred onto other people or even other groups of people. It sounds like you could practice patience and empathy with the elderly. We're all going to get there someday."
BPD,fqb4ks9,t3_ghun4r,1589230474.0,"Psychologists and psychiatrists can diagnose BPD. I recommend looking for someone in your area who either specializes with BPD, personality disorders, or has treated pwBPD before. 

Getting diagnosed with BPD isn't like going to the doctor's and getting diagnosed with strep throat. It usually takes several therapy sessions for doctors to diagnose BPD. BPD is a seriously mental illness. Its symptoms overlap with other disorders so time and consideration needs to be taken to make sure it's the correct diagnosis. 

So start with the search for a psychologist or psychiatrist. PhD psychologists if you can. The more experience the better."
BPD,fqadrdw,t1_fqa7tci,1589217345.0,"I don't know the exact rates of addiction, but one of the downsides of the drug is that it's addictive and often misused. For some people it's the right treatment method - I take Xanax for my insomnia and PRN and it's a godsend. But I knew a lot of other people in treatment programs with me who weren't allowed benzos because of their substance abuse history. It's complicated. As an example, the guidelines say that for people with PTSD should not be prescribed benzos - but they are prescribed them widely across the board and it complicates treatment for pwPTSD.

You might really love this person but those are toxic behaviors. You can work in therapy and skills and other venues to express love in a healthy manner."

BPD,fq8oaec,t3_ghadz8,1589171027.0,"What he said is not a compliment. He either is unaware of how he words things, or he's being passive-aggressive, or honestly maybe manipulative. I've heard about this type of behavior from friends who were in shitty relationships. Their SOs would say stuff like this to make them feel bad while also drawing them closer.

You don't deserve someone who says that type of stuff."
