AskDocs,fjkxbpp,t3_fdw38y,1583435752.0,"Also, a tip that might help your blood pressure anxiety. Since you really do need to be able to safely monitor your blood pressures, it‚Äôs important that you get over this one. The good news is exposure therapy is an extremely effective, non-pharmaceutical treatment that costs almost nothing. And you can even do it in the privacy of your own home, while pregnant!

1. Buy an at home blood pressure cuff and monitor. It can be a cheap one but make sure it has an arm cuff and that the cuff is properly sized to fit your arm. 

2. Starting out, at least three times each day slip the cuff on your arm and loosely Velcro it in place. You don‚Äôt even need to take your blood pressure. Just practice putting it on. If it‚Äôs too much to Velcro it the first time just slip it on and off. Work up to velcroing it so it‚Äôs well fitted and wearing it that way for a minute or two. Again no need to run the monitor until you‚Äôre comfortable with this step. 

3. Once you‚Äôre comfortable with the cuff being velcroed onto your arm try taking your pressures with the cuff loosely velcroed but don‚Äôt look at the reading. Again do this at least 3 times per day, ignoring the readout. Continue this step until you‚Äôre comfortable with the process. 

4. Hopefully by this point some of the anxiety surrounding the cuff will be reduced. Now I encourage you to glance at the reading but not to write it down, google it or tell anyone. Continue to take it at least 3 times a day, but now you should be reading the pressures each time. How‚Äôs your anxiety? 

This process can take one day or several weeks but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs a low cost, painless, drug free way to get over a severe anxiety. You will be sooooo proud of yourself for doing it, too! Give it a shot!!"

AskDocs,fjkuwwi,t3_fdw38y,1583434381.0,"Oh sweetie. Anxiety is the worst, I‚Äôm so sorry it‚Äôs making this experience so scary for you. 

NAD but my first thought is that you and your husband should talk about whether you would like to be parents. Not whether you‚Äôre able to carry your baby safely or manage your anxiety while pregnant/as a mom but is parenthood something you are both on board for? That should be your starting point. If you‚Äôre both excited about the idea of a child but crippled by anxiety, please see an OB or visit Planned Parenthood ASAP as they can help you evaluate the risks to yourself and baby of carrying to term accurately (meaning not the anxiety/fear-driven risk assessment you‚Äôre doing in your head that isn‚Äôt accurate or helpful). 

Either way, you are going to be OK! One thing that has saved my life from crippling anxiety has been mindfulness and meditation. It really helped me reduce anxiety while I was pregnant. Also, FWIW, my overweight friend lost a little weight pretty easily (under doctor‚Äôs supervision) while she was pregnant and has been pretty healthy since (chasing after a toddler keeps you active!). Try not to worry about all those daunting details and focus instead on whether or not you and your husband want a child. If not, there‚Äôs absolutely no shame in terminating. But if you do think you may want to be parents, don‚Äôt let your fears push you to a rush decision. Speak to your healthcare provider first about your anxiety. They deal with this all the time and they‚Äôll know how to support you. 

Big hugs. PM me if you need anything. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

My advice is simple. If your mother doesn‚Äôt provide the type of support you need in your life (you‚Äôre an adult, right?) then stop expecting it and move on. Most of us have less than ideal relationships with our parents and have to just put up with it or decide to separate yourself from the situation.

You‚Äôve been through a traumatic experience, all three of you, and you may need time to heal. Be forgiving of yourself /each other and watch closely for postpartum mood disorders (in mom AND dad) as these are extremely common following difficult births. Watch each other closely and support each other. ‚ù§Ô∏è Congratulations on your little miracle."

Advice,ern2vt0,t3_c2s45v,1561043341.0,"Hi there! Here‚Äôs some practical advice from a teacher. 

First things first, you‚Äôll need to figure our your deficits so you know where to focus your energy. 

1) Can you read? Do you know what level you‚Äôre reading at? There are tests online that can help you with this so you can determine whether you‚Äôre significantly behind grade level. Once you know your reading level, maybe post again for some ideas of books to read‚Äîhistory or science would be great! Kill two birds with one stone!‚Äîfor practice (if needed). 

2) Similarly with writing, how‚Äôs your grammar and spelling? By high school you should have the mechanics down for writing a short essay. If you‚Äôre behind in writing check out[Grammarly](grammarly.com).

3) Math. Do you know the basics: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (by hand) for multi-digit numbers? That‚Äôs an important base. Then fractions, decimals, etc. Try to identify your areas of weakness and look up tutorial videos through [Khan Academy](khanacademy.org). 

You sound very smart in your post, OP. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable for you to catch yourself up before you start classes or at least make some headway. That said, students come into high school with a diverse background of preparedness and teachers know/expect this. 

***Please do share your fears and concerns with your teachers and counselors‚Äîyou can even try to email them this summer if you know who you have. They will guide you through the transition. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I think you‚Äôll do great and love high school! Don‚Äôt be worried‚Äîyou got this, OP!!"
Advice,erkkhrp,t3_c2fwm2,1560965455.0,Best to start out by finding out why. It‚Äôs easier to taller your argument when you know what pseudoscience (from a science teacher! Ugh!) s/he is following. Once you know his/her objection you can easily shut him/her down.

Advice,erct6lt,t3_c1bsd7,1560721293.0,"Oy, this is a tough one. You don‚Äôt really mention it, but how does your grandmother feel about taking care of her sister? I understand that your family is concerned, but are you certain your grandmother wants out? It‚Äôs possible that she really enjoys the company of her sister, or that being able to help brings her a sense of purpose and/or happiness. Just something to consider. 

At any rate I think the first step needs to be a private discussion with your grandmother about what she wants and how you can help her. If she wants an out THEN consider an assisted-living facility, etc. She (your grandmother) knows better than anyone what living arrangements will best serve her sister and herself. 

Good luck!"
Advice,ercsbkl,t3_c1cvs3,1560720622.0,"The sweat sounds like withdrawals. Do you take any other pharmaceuticals or recreational drugs? For example, if you take kratom during the day but don‚Äôt dose at night you may wake up in acute withdrawal. This can also wreck havoc on your emotions. If you are taking an Rx bring this up with your doctor. If it‚Äôs recreational, consider lowering the dose and/or taking an extremely small dose before bed."
Advice,ercrkm0,t3_c1c136,1560720035.0,"Potentially. But rest assured, your phantom phone charging won‚Äôt impact your chances at all."
Advice,ercrg8c,t3_c1d61g,1560719942.0,"Maybe bring them food? If you offer they‚Äôll tell you not to because when you‚Äôre depressed you don‚Äôt think you deserve this type of attention and you don‚Äôt want anyone to go out of their way for you. But if you know their favorite food/restaurant, consider dropping off a meal when you know they‚Äôre really struggling (if they don‚Äôt want to see anyone you can drop it off on the porch and send a text). This is especially helpful for people who lose their appetite with their depression and it‚Äôs sometimes difficult to stay on top of meals when you feel terrible and worthless."
