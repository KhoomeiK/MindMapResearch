If you feel like the boss cares about your general happiness and well being your more likely to stay there as an employee.

You deserve better than this, even if you have issues theres someone out there who will love you and treat you with the respect you deserve and not cheat on you.

3)I don't notice anyone else I work with that seems to be anxious but I'm new there and don't speak the Sam's first language as the rest of the people so I don't know them well enough to know. 

4)when I'm stressed, I get a bit sweaty, the forehead especially, I tend to pace alot or try to find things to do to distract myself and take my mind off the anxiety and stress and often I overwhelm myself and make myself feel worse. I also smoke alot more when I'm stressed. I'm also usually really quiet because I spend too much time thinking and overthinking everything.
