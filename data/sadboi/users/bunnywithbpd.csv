I think maybe a difference is the lack of empathy which is one of the traits listed in the DSM 5 for NPD. Tbh, I would head over to r/npd for this question tbh.

When you learn to love yourself, then genuine love comes more effortlessly. Think about it, how do you expect to have a healthy relationship with someone when you don't have one with yourself? How can you give love to others when you don't let yourself have a source to give from? Self-love is like the source where you can create love and give to others. Giving others love is where you depend on the other returning love to you.

I'm sorry but it also looks like three psychiatrists also seem to ""gave up on you"" in your other post. If these are multiple people having the same result and the only common factor is you, then you're the one failing yourself. The system offers therapy, hospitalization and medication. It does not offer anything more. It seems like you went through all of that and it failed. He spends one hour max with you a week, and you spend 100% of your hours with yourself. You need to take responsibility in taking care of yourself. He cannot do anything more

You just contradicted yourself by saying you are responsible but then made an excuse that you are not because you ""cant think straight"". 

I am just hearing excuses and you putting blame on others when it's really yourself. You seem to want sympathy from others but you don't want to offer sympathy for others like your therapist. 

Seriously, if anything I've been through the same exact shit as you. It only gets better when I fucked up so bad that I realized I was the most toxic in my recovery not others. When I spent all my time victimizing myself, directing my rage at others and self pitying I didnt have time to get better. Just because you go to therapy doesnt mean you're trying to get better.

Also I dont think it was acceptable to have your family yell at him.

They are suffering budget cuts, he seems to be emotionally burnt out and probably afraid of losing his job and you guys chose to yell at him because he said he can't help you? You are responsible for yourself, not others. He isn't even trained to treat people like you. 

I'm sorry but a therapy session is only 1 hour. It is a very small part of your journey. Recovery is a full time job. And recovery is most of your time spent alone, not in therapy working on yourself. Biweekly sessions is completely normal. 

If you truly believe your life is hopeless then it will be. Recovery is having faith life will get better. If you want to recover you have to believe that or else you're going to struggle a lot.

""Your feelings can only tell you how you feel now, it can't tell you why you feel that way & they cannot predict the future no matter how much it tries to convince you it can""
So instead of saying ""he's going to leave me and I'm scared"" simply say ""I feel scared"" 

Don't associate anything with your feelings, if you are anxious, just think of feeling the feeling, don't picture your SO leaving you or a flashback, just *feel* it and realize you are just feeling a feeling that's just a feeling. 

""Life is too short to have doubts"" when you doubt yourself or others, you are too distracted to enjoy your time with them and too distracted to become a better person. You will die someday, as well as your SO. Spend that time being happy with them instead of being consumed in fear.

If you are in doubt, simply rewind and think of things hes done to reassure you, if that doubting voice is still pestering you, imagine if it is just some random troll on reddit DMing mean things. At that point, should you even bother arguing with a troll? Sometimes it's also best to not argue logically with that voice, but to accept that it's there but push it aside as it is not real. 


""There is no point in suffering if there is an opportunity to be at peace"" sometimes we have to suffer, but most of the time, we suffer for no reason. If you are being consumed by your fears, ask yourself, can I be at peace right now? 

True reassurance and love comes from within yourself. (Cheesy but true) I think borderlines chase a type of love we never had as kids and we ended growing up thinking SOs are the cure for that. A lot of the times, i learned when I was obsessively chasing for my SOs reassurance and love, it was because I lacked any in me, and for that, my love for my SO wasnt as genuine as I wanted it to be. When you love/take care of yourself, every aspect of your life becomes much more peaceful. Things I did was learn to spend time with myself, talked to myself more gently and did nice things to myself (cooked meals, played games alone, did face masks) and please realize, if you do want to get better you *need* to do this. And since you need to do it, why not start now? 

Remember tackling this is a muscle building exercise....you get emotionally stronger by practice. First time you feel hurt, it will feel bad, but each and each time you will feel a little more at peace till one day you realize you handle it like a piece of cake without noticing. 

Also one thing I do is open a chat with myself and type all the messages I want to say when I'm having a breakdown. Later when I'm stable I read it over and feel very silly for even thinking that and makes me glad I never sent that to my SO

Have you seen The Last Airbender? There was a villain in the show, Zuko, who tried to capture the Avatar (aang) sent assassins, burned down a village etc. And did a lot of bad things. 

He then realized he was wrong and begged for forgiveness from Aang and his friends and offered to help him end the war. 

The thing is, he could've realized it and let his guilt consume him. But instead he forgave himself and asked for forgiveness of others and ended up being a key character for helping Aang defeat the Firelord. Hes a well loved character from the show and perhaps had the greatest redemption arcs you could see in a cartoon. From the viewers eye, hes very likeable and you can see that he is a good person at heart, despite the things he did. 

So the thing is, when you forgive yourself you allow yourself to become a better person. If you are consumed by guilt and believe you are a bad person, you will be too distracted trying to become better. Which is what you wanted to do in the first place. There is no point in suffering more if there is an opportunity where you can choose to forgive yourself and grow into a better person"

Also I prefer seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists look for what's chemically making you unstable and just slap some pills for you to take, which has been really great for me.

BPD,fadtdr9,t1_fac2ytn,1575985734.0,"It's an experience mostly everyone has on here, just because it's not in the DSM doesnt mean we shouldn't have the symptom...also I was speaking of fear of abandonment which leads most of us being overly attached to one person. Can you stop using that argument to invalidate that we shouldn't have this trait. Lots of people are comorbid with a lot of other illnesses, does that mean they shouldnt have those symptoms or talk about it because it's not part of the bpd criteria? No. Also, technically speaking, we shouldn't have ANY traits of BPD. No one wants to have BPD. 

Like I said, this post is about as stupid as getting upset over bipolar people ""normalizing"" mania. 

Also this subreddit isnt specifically meant for recovery, it's a safe space. So telling people to only support them through recovery methods can actually be less supportive than it seems. Like when depressed people talk about being depressed and the only comments they get is to seek therapy. 

I dont get that last paragraph of yours, it seems to contradict the point of your original post. You basically said its not okay to ""normalize"" FPs. So we shouldnt seek validation as this is a normal part of BPD. If you say people are helped in multiple ways then we SHOULDNT listen to this post because some people are supported through validation. How are people even normalizing it? Do you want us to post a disclaimer in every post ""btw this is toxic and not normal"" otherwise that rule should apply to everything we do here. Also that last sentence applies to you more than me."
BPD,fabtwo7,t3_e7zw34,1575928759.0,"Uh, I think everyone knows its unhealthy. It's a core part of BPD. And it's considered ""normal"" in terms of mostly everyone experiencing that. Everything ""normal"" to BPD is unhealthy and toxic so the posts here are usually venting about every aspect of it. It's a mental illness so anything ""normal"" about it is bad. This is a subreddit for BPD. This is like being annoyed at depressed people for being sad and talking about being sad. Or bipolar people for normalizing mood swings when its literally..part of the illness?? We know it's bad, that's why we vent on this subreddit only. We associate it with this illness, which we know is bad."

BPD,f9v1o85,t1_f9uxp8o,1575661567.0,"He told her ""we have to end this friendship because MY GF IS JEALOUS"" He blamed you for ending it which shouldnt be your fault. He should have common sense not to do that in the first place. 
Also for ways to cope, it's really just self esteem. You cant be jealous without having poor self esteem. You can focus on improving how you feel by doing good self talk, spoiling yourself with some self care stuff like skincare or makeup products and clothes, work on your personal goals, etc. The good thing about jealously is that the solution is simple, hard part is that it isnt easy to actually do."
BPD,f9uwz9l,t3_e6y0w4,1575659197.0,"Okay even for a normal person, that totally justifies jealously. Hes being a fucking dick for blaming you for ending their friendship.
Think if you only talked to someone you were once in love with and then get upset that your current bf doesnt want to have you to them anymore. THATS COMPLETELY REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULDNT TALK TO AN EX/SOMEONE YOU HAD FEELINGS FOR.
He needs to grow up and get actual friends instead of making you feel bad when there is NOTHING wrong with how you feel. 

Girl you're handling this well. Hes being a selfish inconsiderate ass. I would NEVER do this to my boyfriend and he would never do that to me."
BPD,f9qkkw9,t3_e6ec6k,1575562681.0,"I think they can overlap. But I think love means you accept their flaws and it feels like ""coming home to bed"" instead of solely intense fireworks feeling, kind of like daydreaming about a dream house as. Living in your actual home where you feel comfy. Obsession tends to feel more like a fantasy, and love tends to feel peaceful and warm. That's my opinion."

You cant have a slow metabolism because you have to somehow produce energy to maintain your body weight while apparently eating too little to maintain it. Claiming to only eat 600 calories a day for a year and staying at 300 pounds is impossible. That breaks the laws of thermodynamics. 
You can have fast because you can be bad at absorbing energy and just simply dispose too much. Its RARE but it can apply to some people which I dont want to exclude"
EDAnonymous,f9q99qm,t1_f9p0dkl,1575557357.0,My post was about to stop being toxic towards thin people. And you had to go out and make a blanket statement on how skinny people dont have it bad as fatter people. Like..what are you implying? That we shouldn't be nice to them? That literally helps nothing. The point was to stop projecting and indirectly being jealous. Your first two sentences contradicted each other AGAIN. You are literally not getting the point to be more empathetic. I'm done talking about this because I repeated myself several times which isnt going through your head.
EDAnonymous,f9q8fgw,t1_f9paw26,1575556965.0,"You're in an ED sub, where skinny is glorified. Not everyone thinks the way we think. Just because someone else is suffering in a different way doesnt mean they dont deserve help. Thin people struggle with self esteem issues too...jesus christ."

For some people, it's hard to gain weight. Not saying its impossible but their feelings are valid. And honestly let's face it, we aren't that mad because they're lying. We're mostly mad because we're *jealous*."

This is probably a good opportunity to take a ""break"" and prioritize your mental health while he tries to heal on his own when obviously he does not want any other help. This may sound impossible to you right now but since we have BPD we can bounce back and forth with extreme mindsets. Perhaps a month or even a week of no contact will help the situation"

BPD,f88s3f4,t1_f87r1z9,1574360097.0,Key thing is that you need to make a rule to do the thing BEFORE you two begin to get upset. It's more about preventing negativity
fasting,f88roib,t3_dz7ljp,1574359878.0,"Not to be a downer, but this is a sign of a disorder. You're not supposed to feel *that* good fasting. (I wrote an in depth post of this before) but try to see eating like drinking -- do you obsess over water and how much you drink each day? No. Do you feel super great knowing you drank x amount of water? No. Do you go to bed at night thinking about water instead of other things like work, family, friends and other life goals? Is that weird if you did have this obsession with water? Yes. And that should be the same perspective as eating/fasting. It should feel like an accomplishment but not to the point where it makes or breaks your day.    
  
You may not think you're disorder but here are some more signs:  
* you can claim you don't need to weigh yourself every day but you still cave in and do, you cannot stop tracking how much you weigh  
* weight loss and food occupies your thoughts more than actual important things like relationships and family  
  
I suggest fasting for spiritual and mental improvement rather than weight loss. Which means NO WEIGHING. Instead of being occupied by thoughts about food, spend time bonding with others, volunteering, meditating.  
You can also transfer your obsession with food into something positive, create a cookbook, make elaborate fancy dishes and learn to be patient with food. Chew slowly, dont watch TV while eating. Learn to LOVE food the ""right"" way essentially.   

If you're unable to stop weighing yourself I would take this as a sign of a disorder and you need to prioritize your mental health than weight loss."
