Ozark,fq945ij,t1_fq93usf,1589184899.0,I'm not  interested in crying about how people misunderstand bipolar. I get enough of that irl already. Just Ben made the show worthwhile for me.
Ozark,fq93usf,t3_fwka69,1589184604.0,"I have bipolar one and really resonated with Ben. I'm on Lamictal (medication) and have terrified people who love me when unmedicated. I've spent days wondering how I ended up in a psych ward. 

I'm not sure what people mean by it doesn't portray bipolar well. It was really meaningful to see someone on screen like me not be depicted so one-sidedly."

barexam,fpxwyoh,t3_gg36d1,1588991284.0,Congratulations! I took the CA BAR in February but had to move to Nevada afterwards. Found out today I failed CA but looking forward to the NV BAR.
LawSchool,fpql9nh,t1_fpqcrcc,1588825465.0,"Sure, np. My C&F was in CA where there was also no questions regarding mental health. The closest thing to it was something like ""Do you have any emotional/physical disability or impairment that would prevent you from competently practicing law."" Depends how you want to answer that. I said ""No"" because that's the truth since I've been actively treating my BP. I think the key is doing everything you can to be a reliable and functioning future advocate and not letting it get out of hand by time you're ready to get licensed. 

For my psych visit, I got put in a 72 hour hold. I went to a counselor regarding whether to mention it on my app. He said that my hold was a welfare hold, not a police matter. I didn't hurt anyone or myself (thankfully) so I didn't mention it. I have no academic problems or criminal records or other outstanding problems. My app passed. 

Hope that helped."
LawSchool,fpqb5sn,t1_fpfdgk9,1588818926.0,"Thanks for being honest. Glad you had  a way to manage it (and esp in BigLaw). I've heard of people who were able to control their condition w/ alternatives to meds/psych like exercising or just being mindful of not setting it off.

I can't go down that route though. I'm young and don't really understand what's happening to me and how to control it.  I really need outside help to really change."
LawSchool,fpqanle,t1_fpgll33,1588818615.0,"That must be difficult to not be able to plan a consistent schedule when your mood can vary each day. But it's also good you know what keeps you in control (running).  I also agree diet can have an effect on your mood. 

You're right about having other people to trust. My friends don't say the most helpful things but I know they care. I've also been going on online communities (reddit) to just...talk it out and not feel like I'm alone in this. Hoping you are doing  well to in these crazy times."
LawSchool,fpqacbb,t1_fpiydxa,1588818421.0,"I agree with everything you're saying. I personally just struggle with it. I guess law school was an extension of my family background (Asian) where mental health wasn't really a thing we talked about and was taboo. I was afraid to say anything about it (including my psych visit) openly because I was also submitting my moral fitness application that year. 

I never thought about us being anamolies but when I think about it, we really are. I'd feel ready to openly advocate for it when I have the right mix of meds and therapy.  Maybe it's not fear so much as caring for myself first before I can be a good advocate."
LawSchool,fpq9s5j,t1_fpiq3bv,1588818079.0,"Thank you for sharing. It gives me hope to know you learned how to live with it by trial and error. I'm going through that right now and it feels so hard. Getting my routine disrupted is also a big stressor for me (thanks Covid). Thanks for offering to talk, I might DM some time.

I went into law school at 21 and went in and out of psychs trying to figure out what was wrong with me. It was 24 to end up in psych then 25 to get a diagnosis and meds. I regret not finding out sooner. Again, you give me hope that it'll get better as I grow older."
LawSchool,fpq98vt,t1_fpfbkni,1588817758.0,"Glad you find the right mix. I find myself envying my ""normal"" classmates and wonder a lot about what I could have done if I was diagnosed/treated earlier. But getting by in school with this is already an achievement."
LawSchool,fpq93a2,t3_gcz7cp,1588817664.0,Thanks for sharing everyone. I'm open to reaching out if I need someone to talk to (and vice versa).  Just wanted to know if anyone else struggled with this. This is a very heavy burden to bear in an already intense field and didn't like the idea that this condition would bar us from being in it.

I got really isolated in law school. Law school attracts type A folks. Constant networkers. Movers and shakers. My bipolar was becoming severe and I was undiagnosed at the time. I became afraid of people. 

I went on meds. Started therapy. Graduated. But I always just stayed isolated. The ""friends"" I'd made just exhausted me. I don't miss that. But I do miss having people to go to a bar or restaurant with."
bipolar,fo4ms4d,t3_g5e9hi,1587507266.0,"Very happy for you! I get how hard it is to control drinking urges. And I think it's normal to be scared of what you'll be like without it.

I can say I had the easy way out though. I was an alcoholic for a few years until I got put on lamictal. Then all cravings were gone. No struggle with exercising willpower each day."
bipolar,fo4mgnj,t3_g5joyd,1587507094.0,"I don't think it's a bad idea to check in with a doctor and therapist just to check on whether you need meds of therapy. If you're cognizant of what triggers you, that's a good way to mitigate symptoms from going into full mania or hospitalization.

It took me a while to understand stress is a trigger for me so I do my best to manage it now. It took a hospitalization and financial draining too for me to realize the severity and I only wish it didn't get to that point. I'm on 250mg of lamictal too and I definitely need it."

I truly think it's narcissism and wanting to be special."
RightwingLGBT,fngkbc5,t3_g1egjn,1586934977.0,"When I first came out, the people around me said ""queer"" so I identified myself as that. But then it became apparent to me that most people using the word ""queer"" were some real nutjobs.

Now when people ask, I say I'm lesbian. My girlfriend, who is transgender, also hates ""queer"" for the same reason I do.

Part of feeling negative is the fact I tried to take this exam again after being in 2x car accidents and suffering from brain injuries + back problems and not taking therapy. COVID is definitely not helping lmfao. 

I quit my first job prospect b/c my bipolar was actually crippling me. If I fail again, I know it's punishment for not taking my health seriously. Currently, I keep sane through therapy/meds and gradually studying for privacy compliance (CIPP-USA/E). I'd like to open up a consulting firm one day.

quarantine,fn1x9u1,t3_fq436b,1586572336.0,"I have bipolar. A lot of my healthier copying mechanisms were dependent on being able to go outside, like workout/walk off mania or just being able to be around people so I'm not self-harming. Technology is not a substitute for touch and being able to read body language.

Without the outside, I can't access my religious groups or NAMI support groups.  I have a therapist but given the chaos, our meeting time are inconsistent sometimes. Being physically around others, volunteering, being in nature, and being in my community have all helped me to live a normal life.

I'm using what I've learned over the years to keep myself steady, but the lack of physical touch and social isolation is starting to become an uphill battle.  Having contact with another person keeps me together for one more day, but I hope I can keep everything together before spiraling down that same path of alcoholism and abusive behavior I was on for years.

I understand there are bigger things than me at play. I have a lot of faith in our researchers, healthcare workers, and leaders to get us through this. I like to think of each day that I wake up and keep my symptoms in check as a victory and acts my ""contribution"" to society in fighting this.  That might seem small and easy to some people, but it's significant for me."
