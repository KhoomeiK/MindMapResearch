podcasts,fqa8cjm,t3_fbl198,1589214616.0,"This is just happened to me today! My cohost lives in a different state so we always record our episodes in anchor together, and I‚Äôm so disappointed because we both finished recording today feeling like it was our best episode yet! Did anybody have any luck figuring out how to save the audio? I‚Äôm worried if we re-record the episode it won‚Äôt be as good as it is a one side scripted show (my cohost tells me about a new topic each week and I never know what she‚Äôs going to say, so my reactions and responses are authentic and genuine. Very concerned if we re-record it will sound rehearsed on my side and that is not our format). Did anyone hear back from anchor support or figure out how to fix it on their own?"

AskReddit,fck445f,t3_ehg5ac,1577716019.0,"When I was about 17, I had just managed to leave a very abusive boyfriend I lived with. Long story short, he didn‚Äôt take the breakup well and parked him car outside my parents house every night, so I ended up staying with a friend for a few months and one day this friend and I were riding the bus to her house, when I suddenly started feeling very sick and scared. It had actually been a month or two since I‚Äôd seen my ex, as he didn‚Äôt know where I lived and I assumed he was still camping outside my parents house each night or had moved on. Anyway, the bus pulls up to our stop, which is about a 10 minute walk from my friends house. I get cold and clammy and feel very dizzy. I tell my friend we need to hid immediately, so we both got off the bus and hid behind a dumpster bin. About 2 minutes later, my ex boyfriend drives up and past us, on the way to my friends house. Turns out he had figured out I wasn‚Äôt living at home anymore and so he was going over to all of my friends houses, breaking windows, punching cars ect, trying to find me. My friend and I stayed behind the dumpster and waited until we watched him drive back past us. If we hadn‚Äôt hidden he would have found us walking down the street and most likely tried to run us both over. Turns out instead he was greeted by my friends dad and his shotgun. I was never bothered by that ex boyfriend again."

dbtselfhelp,fbczzop,t3_ecgqqg,1576740297.0,"I can also relate. I was in a hospital for 5 months learning DBT, (along with CBT & EMDR therapy for my CPTSD) and in post treatment for over a year before I figured this one out! I remember asking my psychiatrist how I could completely remove my ability to feel / experience anger, and my doctor was very confused why and then spoke to me about why emotions are an important part of life and how removing them is not the goal at all. We had a really long in-depth conversation about each emotion and the positive aspect to each one of them, why we experience them, and why we need them. Afterwards I felt so silly, it seemed so obvious in retrospect but I had never even considered positive aspects to ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotions until then. 
Another huge ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment for me was when my doctor explained that even if you could remove a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotion doesn‚Äôt then mean that would equal you feeling a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù emotion as you might expect.
(Sorry if this isn‚Äôt worded well, I‚Äôm bloody tired)
For instance, if you could get rid of anger, doesn‚Äôt then guarantee it would be replaced with joy, or gratitude. Removing sadness wouldn‚Äôt then cause happiness to take over, ect. 
That thought/realisation has really really helped me.

ptsd,esm2wae,t3_c8c7zj,1562097099.0,"I have the same issue with loud noises/background noises. I have CPTSD. 
You are not being petty at all.  

Sure it‚Äôs not your housemates fault you have PTSD, but I wish your housemate would understand no one wants to be constantly triggered in their own home, the outside world is bad enough, we all deserve our living situations to be beautiful sanctuaries we can rest comfortably and recharge in. 

I‚Äôve been in pretty much the exact same situation, and my advice is to move out/get a new housemate. 
I moved out and have lived with other housemates and am a lot better for it.  Obviously yeah  I still have CPTSD but  I have  far less triggering episodes in my house now as I feel more comfortable with my living situation!

I‚Äôm more likely to be triggered by loud noises when my anxiety levels are way up (duh) and my brain started associating  this particular housemate with triggering behaviour, so my anxiety would be very high up when they were around, which would lead to  more triggering/episodes and on and on. I understand you probably can‚Äôt move out right this minute (I couldn‚Äôt straight away either). I purchased a pair of DeWalt protective earmuffs (I think they‚Äôre called the interceptor) from my local hardware store and hands down they saved my sanity. I first bought noise cancelling headphones but I don‚Äôt always want to be listening to a podcast or music or whatever and not hearing people potentially walking up to me made me too uncomfortable, so I bought the protective ear wear and hands down the best $30ish I‚Äôve spent.

TL;DR I can relate, I have CPTSD and had a similar housemate situation. Move out ASAP, until then, buy a pair of protective ear wear üéß suitable for a job site, wear them at home, live your best life."
