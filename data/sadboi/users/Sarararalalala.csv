beauty,fr0g2h3,t3_glpw1d,1589794364.0,"I recommend watching like, a thousand YouTube videos. 

\-Allana Davison is one of my fave makeup and skincare people because she does videos that aren't looks just for instagram, and she's funny and real.

\-Snitchery is someone I just came across who also puts emphasis on the looking-good-in-person and not just for a camera. 

\-ALEXANDRA'S GIRLY TALK changed my entire life. She has some VERY informative videos about color theory and how to dress yourself well, and basically how to set yourself up to never look bad. She's amazing.

\- if you have questions about hair, consult our hair queen Brad Mondo, of course, at his YouTube channel.

One thing I will say about YouTube channels, however, is that you have to be careful to filter some bullshit sometimes. Since these people are all getting paid to show you products and, basically for them to be pretty AT you, if you fall down YT rabbithole, try not to fall down it watching someone you find yourself comparing yourself to. Bad for your heart <3

I also have one rule that NEVER break:

don't wear clothes or buy clothes that don't fit you (or that wash you out (see Alexandra's Girly Talk from above)). period.   
i have a hard time finding things like pants that fit me, so I always thrift pants that are too big and then have the waist tailored down. Usually the pants cost me \~$10 up front and then like \~$25 for the tailoring, so it's still cheaper than buying new pants AND they end up looking better because they were made to fit me.

And as far as knowing what looks good and what doesn't, trust yourself and also don't judge yourself. EVERYTHING has a learning curve that you just have to get past before you start to recognize what is and isn't working.

Which leads me to some more advice lol: don't be afraid to adjust your approach. If some part of your makeup routine just kinda looks off or you don't feel confident about it, just try something else! Not every product works for every person and not every technique works for every person! There is SO much information out there and probably TRIPLE the amount of products, so there is pretty much statistically no way that some combo of the two won't work for ya and make you feel like a thousand bucks!

Okay and one last note (sorry, I just keep thinking of more things to add), maybe look into Parisian style makeup? The French put tons of emphasis on keeping things quick, clean, and simple. It'd probably be an easier place to start than staring at kim k's caked face and wondering how many pounds of product you need to apply and not to mention hours of your life in the bathroom, to look like her. Remember that your face is just made up of shapes and colors that are unique to you, and WORK with them girl."

When I have moments of desensitization it is because I haven‚Äôt given myself any space (be it physical or emotional) and need to rest. Take your time and once you can relearn to feel your own feelings properly and fully, your empathy will too return.
