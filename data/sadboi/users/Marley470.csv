IWantToLearn,fq8m2j8,t3_ggz443,1589169420.0,Great thread. It‚Äôs not easy. When you do actually say what you actually want to say you‚Äôve put yourself in their life. Never an easy situation. But putting yourself in that view/position makes you vulnerable. Makes you think about your own life and experiences. And trust me. You still won‚Äôt know what to say but you and they will know you understand the pain. Sometimes it‚Äôs not words. I wish you the best.
HumansAreMetal,fpz2lxa,t3_gg00sf,1589012645.0,This is inspiring. Good moment in a bad time. Thank you
memes,fo9zkt4,t3_g6gz3y,1587635786.0,It should be an honor to complete that. Not many people are blessed to be in your position.  I don‚Äôt know you but I am proud of you and hope you understand that you are so important.  I know you will do everyone proud. This is why you do it brother.

bayarea,fhk0n9a,t1_fhjwirk,1581661887.0,They ended up remodeling the mall next to me and it has brought back the visitors and shoppers. I hope that your spot bounces back. I understand your thought process and hate to see all the local stores closing.
bayarea,fhjufpi,t3_f3b9q2,1581655925.0,I like that you filmed the mall and it‚Äôs decline and I‚Äôve experienced it with our local mall. But you didn‚Äôt stop into any stores or support any of the businesses you walked passed. Love those stores you used to go to as a kid also and sad to see them go.

SuicideWatch,ffemuc3,t3_esypi2,1579854968.0,"Hey there, new to Reddit but also been going through the shit storm. Your college career sounds a lot like mine. I started as a business major, then went into graphic design, then went into teaching. I was young, I‚Äôm 39 this year. I promise you I haven‚Äôt figured put my shit yet either. I‚Äôm short, old, out of shape and dealing with being single and along. I‚Äôd share a photo if you need proof. I just want to let you know that at your age you have a whole future before you. Please look at your so called incomplete failures as a journey. Maybe you failed is because you are destined for better. Maybe your interest accumulate into something that you are destined for. I left college a drop out but learned that I related to elementary kids and went into that area.  Maybe what you‚Äôre learning is getting you prepared for what you are destined for. Please never judge your accomplishments to others. Doubt is normal and so is some times self hate but that‚Äôs the easy way to look at life. There are and will be people that look up to and need you. We all feel like we are not special and just part of the mass population.  I‚Äôve felt that way. And as much as people say it‚Äôs a state of mind and a feeling it‚Äôs not easy to shake. I only got away from you state of mind was to start helping people and caring. I‚Äôm in the Bay Area and will always be around if you want to talk or hang out to get away from your state of mind. Life‚Äôs a bitch and it‚Äôs tough but I figure that if we get away from caring that it will never change. In all retrospect, I‚Äôve been where you are now and if you ever doubt that please contact me and we can talk. Bless you and please smile."
SuicideWatch,ffem4f6,t3_esy5hp,1579853963.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for you losing your child. I‚Äôm hurting and sitting here sharing your pain. I can‚Äôt imagine your loss and will never know that pain.  I don‚Äôt know you but want you to know I‚Äôm here if you need anything.  I just a single male in the Bay Area but just dealt with a suicide at my work. Great guy but he might have had demons. He left a daughter and fianc√©. Breaks my heart.  Please know that your pain as much as it‚Äôs your own is shared by me. Again, when I reread your post title I‚Äôm speechless and broken hearted. If you ever feel alone you can contact me. I know we are strangers and leaving my contact may put me at risk but my contact is 408.799.8338. Please call me if you are struggling or just can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôll stay awake to be around. But I am so sorry for your loss."

ThanksManagement,ffd6gze,t1_ffcbtp0,1579814354.0,It‚Äôs tough in the Bay Area. Everything is priced ridiculously and unfortunately I don‚Äôt have the authority to alter prices. The rent prices always depend on the current market rates.  Thank you!
ThanksManagement,ffd6cjc,t1_ffcy3fm,1579814285.0,My company manages the property for an ownership and they haven‚Äôt approved cameras.  But I went with my maintenance supervisor and we bought our own and set them up. I feel the residents need to feel safe and secure. Thank you!
ThanksManagement,ffd5tjt,t3_esrfz7,1579813990.0,Thank you so much. I appreciate it
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff8lbxs,t3_es64cd,1579684090.0,It‚Äôs 1am now and I just came across this post. New to reddit but it‚Äôs not my usual go to app. I‚Äôm a property manager for 396 units in the Bay Area. Today I lost a resident to suicide.  He was just in his 30s and had a child and fianc√©. Great guy that I just spoke to recently. Having a hard time processing this. Thank you for the post

FuckYouKaren,ff2he2b,t3_eqxc6e,1579506219.0,Poor Tori. I hope she took the vacation she deserves.  Entitled idiots like this guy need to be called out.  He should not be a so called journalist and who ever hires this c*** needs to see this post. Anthony Bourdain was a world traveler and amazing person so if he calls you out it means your a prick.

IllegalLifeProTips,fajk6el,t3_e9haqz,1576141920.0,"I just came across this and thought I would give me input for the first time on reddit since it might be helpful.  I am a property manager and might have some insight on this issue.  
First of all sorry for having to deal with a sewage back up...they are disgusting.  The fans are there to dry the walls and flooring but there could still be a moisture issue that can lead to mold and water damage.  They are useful for back up by a feeder line aka clean toilet water but a sewage back up is much different, they need to consider the health hazards.  I would not recommend withholding rent if you decide to still reside in the apartment. The court will judge against you if you go to court since you‚Äôre still residing in the unit it constitutes that it is habitable.  The best and fastest way is to provide the management office with a letter from your doctor stating the health effects it is causing...sewage back ups are gross.  I always recommend getting your own renters insurance for these reasons as they will cover the costs for temporary housing while the complex completes the work.  Please keep me updated on this and if they continue refuse to change your flooring please let me know and I‚Äôll research some other options while at work."
