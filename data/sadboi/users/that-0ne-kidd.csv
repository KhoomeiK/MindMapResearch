I would definitely suggest mentioning something along the lines of “I’m doing So much better now, but I have a scar from a while back that’s still kind of red and would like to know if there is a way I could hide it during your class, do you have any suggestions” always make sure you say you’re doing better now or teachers will typically blow it out of proportion as they are mandatory reporters.

Advice,fpq0tax,t3_gev1at,1588812907.0,"Oh dear. I’ve been in this situation multiple times. Being a young teen girl on social media can be very challenging. Especially if you have any type of conscious and care about others. My advice to you, as a 16F, do not worry about them reporting you. You’re 14, you didn’t lie to him about your age, he has NOTHING on you. You literally cannot get in trouble if this post is 100% accurate. You’re parents are not abusive as you stated, so even if he reported that- everything would work out fine. Block him. Block him brother. Be weary of accounts who message you asking about the situation as it could be a fake account of his. Stay away. Ignore. Block. Move on. It’s simple steps. I know they’re hard because he threatened suicide. But he won’t do anything. He sounds narcissistic and attention seeking. He’ll be fine. So worry about making sure YOU’RE going to be fine. You delete people like that from your memory. They’re terribly toxic and this is a situation where you caring too much can cause a lot of negativity in your life. Keep your head up kiddo. It will all be alright. Last thing though, his “brother” sounds like it’s him on a second account."
leopardgeckos,fpk8ord,t3_gdyqi3,1588690128.0,"If it will be more than 3-4 days until you can get new worms or crickets, I would do it. Depending on his age and size of course. If he is younger but big enough, I would say do it if you can’t get to the store in the next 2 days. Older geckos can go longer between feeds if necessary, hence why their tails get fat- in case they need extra vitamins and stuff between meals. But other than that, pinky mice are about the size of some crickets so if that’s what you need to do to keep him fed, I don’t see anything wrong with it. Just don’t keep him on pinkies for too long and offer him extra calcium if he wants it. Also, when you get more worms I suggest picking up some stuff that will last you in case this happens again. Like freeze dried meal worms, freeze dried crickets or even the “Can o crickets”. The can smells absolutely repulsive but my little one loves them if I dangle them by tongs. Of course though, take my suggestion with a grain of salt as I am NOT an expert. I am simply a gecko owner offering what I would do given your situation. I will tag the foods I suggested below so you can see what I’m talking about. These are the things I use for my gecko as well. :))

I suggest making a list of the things you have at her house- get her to text you and confirm those things are there. And call the non emergency hotline, explain what happened last time you went to get your stuff and see if an officer will go with you to get it as you already have her confirmation that it is your stuff there. Second, block her and her family to cut off communication with such a terribly toxic individual. If you’d like to rebuild friendships with the others who dropped you then you can try messaging them with your side of what happened? I’m not sure how to help with that part as people tend to hear only what they want to and I’m not sure if you should even be around people who are so quick to drop you without so much as asking for your side of things. But your boyfriend- keep him. Hold him close. I’m assuming hes staying by your side through all of this which is an amazing thing of him to do.

leopardgeckos,fontqgf,t1_fonr4uc,1587926284.0,"I would suggest start with small food or even freeze dried. Just leave them in his tank to let him eat if he wants them. Try a variety or different insects such as crickets, mealworms, dubia roaches (however you spell it) as sometimes they like to change their choice of food out of nowhere. It’s a common thing actually, especially as they age. But again, just offer food for when he wants it. Some people would just leave him alone with food until he’s hungry enough to eat it. I personally love the way you’re taking care of him, with other food options. But he will eat if he gets hungry enough. Just watch his weight and make sure it doesn’t drop too much. My gecko went from like 6-9 crickets a week to 3 per week and now he’s eating normal again. I know mine is a little different as he was still eating. But diet changes are pretty common. I wish you the best. That’s about all the advice I can give you as I’m not by any standards an expert"

Or something similar to the linked ones. In my opinion, they look a little silly. But if you can work them into your wardrobe and you like them, go for it. 
You could try putting liquid concealer and then a powder over it to match your skin tone. 
But honestly, as far as my knowledge- that’s about it. 
If it’s a flat (non keloid) scar meaning it’s flush with your skin but just has the coloration, I would definitely try to makeup and then use a waterproof setting spray or use water proof makeup to begin with 😂 
I wish you the absolute best and hope you find a way that works for you"
leopardgeckos,fon8n2j,t3_g88pkc,1587914592.0,"Well, if your tank and temperature are correct then I really wouldn’t stress it. It’s fairly common for them to switch how much they want to eat or what bugs they decide to eat. Just keep offering food normally. My gecko was down the one cricket every other day for a while (3 crickets total per week). And now he eats 6-9 per week. And the tank surfing I have no idea, just try to take him out more I would say."

snakes,fojrd3v,t1_fojr1ja,1587827766.0,Very observant sir. Thank you for your services
snakes,fojr8t9,t3_g7v1eg,1587827691.0,Looks like DeKay's brownsnake to me but I could be wrong 🤷‍♀️
Jigsawpuzzles,foihgw5,t3_g7mwto,1587786754.0,I sort my pieces like that too 😊😊
leopardgeckos,fohmruw,t1_fohlhws,1587768582.0,"Never said it was good or responsible. But honestly, if the tank was big enough- two females who get along isn’t an issue housing them together. I had my two boys together until I could get another tank and they slept side by side 🤷‍♀️ of course I watched them closely but non aggressive pairs aren’t really bad to have together in my opinion. But again, that’s if the tank is big enough and they get along. But again, my opinion. Not everyone agrees but as long as the animals aren’t being harmed then we should all be on the same side/page as people in a reptile subreddit:)"

But for now you could try changing them when they’re sleeping so they’re more calm (I’ve never tried that but I heard it helps). You could give them their pacifier or try heated wipes. Singing songs, talking. Anything to keep their mind busy really. Wishing you the best!!"
leopardgeckos,fofuosw,t1_fofkzni,1587743141.0,That’s adorable 😭😭
leopardgeckos,foefkyr,t3_g718vk,1587702555.0,I have my sister hold him (my baby) when I clean his tank. :)) he could just be scared of whatever you’re doing
bipolar,fodu329,t1_fodsrto,1587690142.0,That’s so true. I hope you find good inspiration tomorrow
