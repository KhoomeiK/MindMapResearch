dating,f05s9fp,t3_d3p9dg,1568418186.0,"While I wouldn't say I am particularly attracted to asian men more than other men, or even as much, I'm definitely attracted to asian them when they're particularly handsome and tall (only because I am almost 6ft tall), I actually think that a genuinely attractive asian man can oftentimes be more attractive than white guys to me. One thing I have noticed (not true for everyone but just something I have picked up on with my asian friends/guys I have dated) that isn't so attractive is that a lot of asian men don't ever think anyone would like them and have a self deprecating attitude. Probably because there's something societal that makes a lot of them feel unattractive. My best friend is with a really sweet, confident, funny asian guy right now and she is a gorgeous and awesome girl, so I do think that y'all have just as much of a chance as anyone! Personally for me, a handsome, tall asian guy with a confident, happy personality? I am sold instantly."

I have never been rejected before, but I read posts on here about so many guys who don't know how to turn girls down and now it makes me a little anxious about dating because I SO don't want to waste my time going out with someone who isn't interested. Just be honest. The BEST way to go about it is when they ask to hang out again, tell them ""I don't want to send the wrong message, I think you are really wonderful, but I don't feel as though we are compatible (or you could say we are better off as friends, etc.)"". It's nerve wracking and doesn't feel all that great, but it is way better to be real about it so neither of you waste your time. If she's a little bit crazy she will make you out to be the bad guy, but whatever, you were nice enough about it. Most girls would probably take that and move on."

Anxiety,ewlzuic,t1_ewlywo8,1565539891.0,"This was an incredibly sweet and awesome comment. Thank you SO, SO MUCH! It is also great advice. As long as I haven't harmed anyone (which is my worst nightmare and I couldn't imagine harming anyone in any of those ways), it is going to be okay. I do have some social anxiety that I have overcome through the years, but it pops up here and there!   
I wasn't necessarily raised religiously but my parents were raised strictly catholic and I think that the way they parented and acted definitely involved constant feelings of guilt on me, even if it wasn't to do with God, I do think that the Catholic guilt placed on them all of their lives was also placed on me. 

I think a lot of my guilt now is coming because I have a daughter and I don't want to be a failure or have anything stopping me from achieving goals for her, and if anything ever came around it would be a huge roadblock. Even though that makes pretty much zero sense, it feels like a very real thing to me.  
I am definitely going to be making a list and following those steps, that will be a HUGE help.   


Thank you so much for your incredibly kind words and advice!"
antidepressants,ewlvjid,t3_cowmy5,1565536971.0,"I was terrified of taking them, I avoided it for ages. I recently finally felt like I needed to go on them, spoke with my doctor about what I am looking for, what side effects I am willing to put up with etc., and I finally started Wellbutrin! I have been on it for 7 days and I already feel a huge improvement.

 I do have to say, a lot of people take antidepressants and assume that should be all that they need to feel better, when in fact, it is really important to go to therapy and work on yourself and do the hard work to get yourself into a better place in life. Antidepressants alone aren't a cure all but they are an incredibly useful tool when it is done right! Thee right ones/the right doctor will be able to help you get off them when you are ready, and back on them when you feel like you need to. It can really drastically improve your life. Best of luck!"

I wanted to share my antidepressant journey just so other people can see the potential things they may experience day to day, and also so that they can compare and contrast with other things that they have read/their own experience! I know for me while researching antidepressants, seeing several different videos, blogs, and posts about Wellbutrin helped me make a well informed decision. I also know that right now, while taking it, it is great to see what other peoples experiences are and how it differs.  I would like to assume that most people going on antidepressants are well aware that they work differently and are an entirely unique experience for each person, some work better for certain people than others, as doctors have to make them aware of that."

I am really sorry about your situation, I honestly can't imagine going through that.  But I am incredibly proud of you for picking up the pieces and creating a wonderful life for yourself and your child!   
My advice coming from my experience:

I was recovering from postpartum depression/anxiety/ptsd and then my daughters father left when she was 5 months old, and it added to the trauma/depression. I was upset and sad but I have been working so hard to get out of the depressive negative feelings, and I did really well for a while! Things generally were more positive!  
Then about one month ago I suddenly felt so much sadness and extreme anxiety. The sadness was different from my previous depression, it sounds a bit like what you were explaining!  I felt consistently sad and I honestly almost didn't notice it because that became an every day thing. Crying and panic attacks were an every day thing.  My friends literally had to sit me down and tell me I need to go get some help because I seemed overwhelmed and depressed and worn out.   
I finally decided to start taking Wellbutrin! My doctor and I decided that because it seems to be my depression coming back/situational from being overwhelmed, that I will trying it for a few months or so, and then go off it if I feel ready, or stay on it if need be. She essentially explained that Wellbutrin is great especially for shorter term. Sometimes you need a little help!"
