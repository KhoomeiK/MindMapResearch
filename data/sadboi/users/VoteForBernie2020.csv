Well spoken, but not moral or trustworthy (again in my humble opinion). 
Yang, after seeing him in the debate, I kinda felt bad for the guy. He has zero ideas about how to make anything better. He does want to give every American $1000 a month. You ask him about any issue and all he can do is circle back to his $1000 a month idea, as if that will fix everything.

newhampshire,fh8lmse,t1_fh7vrls,1581362353.0,"Okie dokie, so solicalism being a stepping stone to communism? Sounds like a scare tactic. I don't think there's any evidence of that. It reminds me of things like ""gay marriage? What's next, we marry monkeys?"" Well, no. Nobody wants that.  In some ways I do think the government is too big. Maybe let the states take the reigns more on some issues. It's just difficult to run an organization that big, without things slipping through the cracks. So, I'm not really after more government control, so much as more government support. And Sanders hasn't implied in any way that any rights will be lost, except, obviously, the right to hold onto your money. Your tax may very well be higher if you are currently living comfortably. Other than THAT key issue that everyone hates, (well not everyone, it won't hurt anyone who's already struggling), rights, freedoms, and civil liberties would be at their best under his direction. You mentioned greed, if the money's in the government, there will be and corruption, and misuse of your tax dollars. Yes. There is all that now. Will more money mean  more dollars wasted by our governments? Well, I can expect you to think so. There is terrible waste there, all I can say is that I personally trust Bernie with that money. His heart really seems to be in the right place. Say what you want about his  ideology, at least he cares about our country and our people and wants to do right by us. I can't think of anyone else I can say that about. Again, if you disagree with what he's doing, obviously you're not going want your money spent on it. That makes sense. 

2. 
I can't pretend to know all the military issues or what's the right and appropriate expenditures, so I'll have to leave it as my basic understanding that we spend more than the rest of the world combined, and almost everything we're involved with has a greed factor, rather than protecting us or our homeland. Here's a link of some of the examples of poorly spent funds, that's not even intentional stuff.  Who knows who's actually to blame for this stuff, but it sucks. And yeah, just in my humble opinion we should pare down the military and work on our international relations instead https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/7/us-military-wasting-money/

3. 
Healthcare. We currently spend 3.5 trillion per year, which comes in slightly lower than the 28-32 for the first decade that's projected. That may seem too little a difference for you to get on board, but remember, most people can't afford to actually USE as much healthcare as they would if it was free or affordable.  So it will a little less and we'll get more out of it. I think maybe because it's consolidating everything. Simplifying it. Yes it will be a huge endeavor, but we'll need less people to do all the same thing, than we do managing the various details of the millions of available plans and helping people sort through their issues and fighting with them about covering what they need etc. Again we're at a place where maybe this will work well, maybe something else would be better, we just have to try something, this is something we haven't tried yet, and the main thing is that we need someone who really will work for the people and not the sponsors who funded them. Does this ideology work perfectly for everyone who's tried it? no, neither has socialism OR our corrupt version of capitalism. Anything could fail, or succeed. It's a matter of how well it's all managed, whether the funding is there to make it work, and what kind of legislature you can get into place to support it, like limiting drug profits, and caps on medical supplies and procedures. Those we can probably agree on, it's just a matter of someone actually getting it done, which could prove difficult. 

Not sure what the threat of arrest is that your referring to in regard of raising taxes.. 

4.
Taxes. I'm okay with 15%, that's not Bernie's plan. Maybe he needs more to make the dream work. All I can say (and this is where it gets controversial) is how much money does anyone really need? Should one person have infinite funds when other people are dying of disease or malnutrition? There's only so much money a person can EARN. After that it's all money making more money, at that point it doesn't hurt to lose a lot of money. You STILL have more than you can spend. Now I'm not sure if this example is an exaggeration, or not. Maybe I don't agree with his plan 100%, I haven't explored it that far, because I'm not really concerned with what's fair to people who are already living a life of privilegeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But this is the impression that I get, and I like to think that, if I had that much money, I wouldn't mind paying it. Not that I expect everyone to feel the same, that's not really in our nature. 
As far as individuals not paying taxes, I admit I have no idea. I can only assume that most of them use lots of loopholes, keep their money in off shore accounts etc. Almost no one becomes a billionaire by playing fair and doing the right thing, and taxes are just an extension of their other money managing ""skills"". 

5. 
Schools. I just think it will really cost very little in the grand scheme of things. Assuming again that the real problem of what schools can charge, can be addressed. I just think it's worth it to have a forward thinking, educated country working on these issues. Again, agree to disagree on what people should be forced to pay for, but remember these things make people HAPPY. It makes you feel taken care of. The world is your oyster. You can't put a price on that. And that's where the equality comes in. I'm not sure what you mean by  the unequal outcomes. Certainly it will be what people make of it, and what their actual abilities are. Affirmative action would be a moot point. It would actually be equal opportunity for all, which is the kind of world I want to live in, so, worth-it-to-me . If NH doesn't want to pay for it, I can see that, but even if a lot of it is just for trade schools, it would still be a good thing to have. I just can't convince people to pay for it.  Here's the breakdown if you're interested https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/tuition-free-college.html

6. 
Small businesses. https://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-small-business-and-entrepreneurship/. I  just skimmed over this article, but I don't think Bernie won't make things harder for small businesses. That goes against his whole principal. He'll help them out in other ways. It's huge conglomerates that he's going after. Anyway glad it was a good conversation. I learned a few things trying to answer your questions. I'm sure neither of our minds were changed much, but hopefully we are both walking away with mutual respect and understanding. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è"
newhampshire,fh8a2ub,t1_fh80jg9,1581355327.0,"It is hard to justify some of the video, but again I don't really know enough about it to suddenly question his moral integrity. He's been fighting for civil rights forever, and I understand that the degree of socialism he's going for (we already have SOME socialists programs of course) is not going to be embraced by everyone. Nor is any government plan ever going to perfect. There is a need for change, we can disagree about what will work and what won't. In a perfect and incorruptible society, probably any of them would be fine. In reality, I don't know how much hope to have for us as species regardless. If Bernie does get elected, there's only going to be so much he can do with congress and fighting him one ever single thing. So you don't really need to worry about anything changing.

IDK, I still don't totally understand what that was about, sounds pretty bad, but it's not like any other countries hands are clean). I'm not sure if this clip was even after that or not. He doesn't refer to anything specific. Anyway, he just wanted to point out that socialism itself does work.

newhampshire,fh7t7ow,t1_fh7rddb,1581344069.0,"No he's not a communist. There is a huge difference between communism and socialism. I can tell already that most of this is going to be taken out of context like the bread line thing, where he's just basically saying starving people in other places would be happy to stand in line for some food, not that that's his vision for America. Or pointing out that some governments who have taken more control do have benefits to show for it. I'm sure he's never wanted communism (full ownership of all things, and total control of your life), he just wants to meet the basic needs of every citizen so the American dream is attainable for everyone, which is becoming more and more difficult and unlikely for most of us.  I'll finish watching this video in case there's more I need to look into, but I think you have him all wrong. Whether you agree or not, we should at least stick to the facts

Yep, finished. I see that it's meant to scare people, but I just saw my candidate, trying to make people understanding the benefits of socialism, like he's always done. You can't take specific failed examples and say that will happen to us (OR that he was condoning people who did wrong), those issues were unrelated to what we'd be doing. The point is always the same and people are still scared. But if you think this government is working now, it's not. If you believe in capitalism, you should expect equal opportunity to follow your dreams. The system is rigged in favour of the rich and is only getting worse. Basic health care and education for everyone, plus a $15 minimum wage, will go a long way to level the playing field. In the video Sweden or Denmark was saying they don't consider themselves socialists at all, they feel like a capitalist country, despite having free healthcare and higher education, which just goes to show that we can be both, and it's not going to this big scary thing that takes away our freedoms or anything else."

If they're considering Buttigieg, I wrote this comment earlier : Buttigieg is funded by billionaires, including some linked with Trump. He's bought and paid for and isn't going to help us. He's also involved with the shady company who conveniently failed to provide results in Iowa, denying Bernie a victory speech and public momentum.
 We're much better off with Bernie. He's the only one that can be trusted. We need a higher minimum wage, and Medicare for all. He's also going to legalize marijuana in all 50 states 

 https://consortiumnews.com/2020/02/04/buttigieg-backer-top-funder-of-group-behind-iowas-disastrous-voting-app/

And here's another convo I had addressing issues someone brought up about him:

 Thank you for your response.

First off, Bernie is NOT a communist. Socialism is maybe halfway between communism and capitalism, if that. Communism is when the government owns and controls ever single facet of your life. With socialism, we're just looking to help people live the lives that they want, and have their basic needs met.

We spend more on our military than the whole rest of the world combined, so I think we have plenty of wiggle room there. Also if we'd get out of everyone else's business and stop screwing up their countries for our own profit, they wouldn't hate us so much. 

Yes we would cover our own expenses for these services through taxes, but it would cost a lot less than the current system. Insurance and big pharma companies have inflated prices to a sickening degree. 
I don't know what your experience with free healthcare has been, but right now in America, an estimated 26,000 people die every year because they can't afford healthcare. And many thousands more are just suffering with their problems. In fact I doubt that number includes suicide. Some mental health care would be good. So, I think any free healthcare is better than nothing. If you're not happy with that and want to get your own, I'm sure that will still be an option. 

Going to school is a big investment of time and effort, so yes, I think people who choose to go to college will take it seriously. Even if some people take classes just for fun cause they're interested in the subject, I think that's fine. It should be an option for anyone to get an education. I think it would benefit our society as a whole if people were more educated. And if someone changes their mind about what they want to do, hey, no problem!  They move in another direction and take some more classes. They won't be locked into their chosen path because they're in debt now and can't afford to have wasted that money, and need to hurry and get their career started so they can pay it back. I don't see why it should cost much more than k-highscool which I think everyone can agree is a good thing to have. And I do think it's important to have a level playing field for people to have equal opportunities. If you believe in capitalism, you should believe in equal opportunities, which just isn't happening right now. 

As far as our state motto goes, we pay more in property tax, tolls, and other fees here and there that make up for some of the the taxes we don't pay. I understand that people don't want to pay more taxes, or any taxes if they can help it, but really if they added up what they spend on things now, most would come out on top. I know it's hard when you're not the one who's sick or needs to make their way in the world. If you worked hard and got to a place you're comfortable with, it's easy to think everyone else can too, but that's not always the case. It's also difficult to stand by and watch people get free school when you worked so hard for it. It's not fair, that sucks. But think where you could have been now if was ""free""(for a reasonable tax, on a $15+ wage). It would be better, right? If it sticks, you're kids can be whatever they want, and it won't take you refinancing your house and spending your life savings on it. I think if people didn't have to stress SO much about SO many things, we'd feel a lot more free. Live free or die NH, in whatever way it means to you

Sorry that's long and not totally relevant to you, but I hope there's a few good points in there"
