If you like shooter CTP games try -Overwatch!
If you like open world survival games ARK- is really fun too and it’s really grindy just like dead by daylight so it never gets old"

Gamergirlsriseup,fp154ri,t1_fp0ze9s,1588224676.0,Obviously I know you know not ALL guys are like that. There’s been some guys to defend but stills it’s like.. why does this have to be so.... weird just because I’m a girl playing a game? The majority of guys that I’ve came across ( that are ultimately just shit at the game) feel so entitled over a girl haha
Gamergirlsriseup,fp14yxa,t1_fp0ze9s,1588224549.0,"I KNOW DUDE. I mean, I know there’s guys that are chill or whatever.
But maybe it’s my anxiety and maybe you can relate,  but when the guys make it such a big deal that “ WHOOoooA  a girl is on here” it’s like pressure. You know? Like a spot light. And they make it such a big weird ordeal and make weird ass comments that idk how to respond to because I’m awkward af just trying to do something to entertain myself but they just usually say things so condescending. It’s awkward haha"
Advice,fl0yd33,t1_fl0ul87,1584718346.0,"I’m currently not in therapy but I keep meaning too. My sister sees a woman who is apparently very excellent. 
I have a skewed image of therapy ONLY because when I was in therapy many times before I didn’t see much use in it helping me at the time. I get they listen to you vent and ...listen but it didn’t seem very productive and I didn’t really feel I was getting to an issue. 
But like I said my sister sees this woman and she’s making my views change about it. 
But yeah you’re very right. Maybe I am using it as an excuse. I am very lazy... I could lay in bed all day maybe  
The discipline is what I very much need but it’s hard giving it to myself and sticking to it and not getting lost in the thoughts. But I’m sure that’s where therapy comes in"

BPD,ffsikhr,t3_eut1sz,1580182566.0,"I hope you the best! 
I’ve spent the better part of my teen years in mental hospitals for self mutation. 
Different doctors telling me I have this and this and that. One actually telling me I do have BPD but the name “ boarderline” just seemed so...  not fit for how I felt? 
When I was 22 I got in my first real relationship as it was toxic. I was toxic, I didn’t understand my emotions and why they were so intense and hard to control. 
I think because I did self harm it was all very intense for me but seeing how I hurt myself and hurt someone I cared about I finally realized there was something else wrong with me. This isn’t /just depression or anxiety. 
I had to take a step away from my relationship. Tried to figure myself out and just fix myself. I wanted to be better- I didn’t want to be like my mom. Which who I was exactly acting like ( my mother has BPD) 
I figured it out later in that year when my mom went through my old hospital paper work to find what the doctors diagnosed me with because she thought she had the same thing. “ BPD”
So I did more research and whoa.... 
it was only up from there"
BPDsraisedbyBPDs,ffshgge,t1_f3yxd67,1580181797.0,"I’m actually pretty ticked about it too. 
I wrote a story about my mom having BPD and living in a situation with her again. 
Apparently I broke a rule? So I messaged them to ask if they could help me understand the rule I broke? 
They asked if I had another user before writing “ Oh nvm BPDS aren’t allowed here” 
???? So I wrote 
I’m not BPD but my mother is. And also no I don’t have another user. 
So then they block me from messaging them for 72 hours. Like wtf ? Ugh. So annoyed."

My bank is looking a little dry, actually it’s completely empty with shit at the bottom of the lake. 
-100$ is not in my bank right now. 

I quit my job thinking I’ll find another one fast. Nope. 
So what do I do? 

I lay in bed one night and watch Housewives of NJ
And realize they all wear extensions 

I want extensions... I’ll like my appearance better and it’ll motive me to get a job when I’m feeling fly af. 
But I know I couldnt get any... no green 

But I go on amazon anyways and scroll through some copper extensions click on some, look at the picture reviews 
I can’t help myself, I pretend like I’m actually going to buy one to see if I even could 
I CAN! Sure it’ll pull out more nothing it my bank and leave me more negative, but it’s already negative so it couldn’t hurt. 
They arrive. Not even the same kind of orange. 
So what do I do? Give up right? I’ll never find the exact copper as my hair anyways. 
No, I go on the internet and type in copper hair extensions which lead me to different sites and I see all these beautiful extensions 
My favorite is 88$ but there’s no way it’ll take my card information since I’m negative. Oh no, but it does   
I can’t even wait for these extensions I pay even more for fast delivery. I get them in 5 days 
They finally come in the mail 
And 
I’m
So
Disappointed. Too dark.... 
I didnt tske the extensions out from the bag Incase I wanted to return them... but I didn’t end up returning them. I tried selling it on eBay- no takers. 
So I just threw it away

BPD,ffr0v3z,t3_eupsvj,1580147994.0,"I’ve felt that way for a long time and still do, but maybe not nearly as much as I used too. 
I really didn’t know who I was or what I wanted. I couldn’t think for myself and I felt very stuck being 25 with nothing. 
I did want to change though, a lot of my life has been like this and I was tired of feeling sorry for myself and I felt everyone around become exhausted from me. 

It’s really hard for me to sit and think about myself, like why do I feel this way? Because my mind races too much. So what really helped me was weed ( as far as getting into my thoughts) 
Everytime I smoked I felt heavy and just not happy which is a lot of why I didn’t like smoking with people. 
I would smoke along and these thoughts would just come up we’re I would just realize WHY I’m not happy and it was just like a puzzle. I had to write it down because a second later I would forget the thought. 

What do you want? It’s such a vague question. 
But instead of worrying of other people and what they want from you or think of you shouldn’t matter. 
It’s your life, you’re the one living it. You know you don’t like how you feel right now and you can change it. 
It does take time and work but even if you just had a day for yourself and just did something you liked or even just got into your head a little bit with a journal, getting honest about how you really feel with no judgment I feel a minute of that could help you even just a little. 
You gradually get small puzzle pieces of a clue of yourself and you slowly piece it all together. It takes time but it will eventually be put together"
