BPD,fkj23sv,t1_fkj080g,1584234242.0,"Yes!!!!
That's what's so damn confusing about this disorder. 
I don't think that us having ""hypersensitivity"" is the issue, and I do genuinely believe people have become desensitized in this society. The manner of how we process our sensitivity in hurtful situations and react (outward or inward) is the real challenge and is what ends up being ""destructive"""

BPD,fkegjww,t3_fi06qa,1584112733.0,"That's better than hurting yourself or drinking?
Idk, marijuana is medicinal. It's the only thing that can calm me down. Obviously it's not good to suppress emotions but until you learn other coping skills I don't see anything wrong with smoking weed if it makes you feel better"
BPD,fjz45p6,t1_fjyjb1p,1583710971.0,Of course. Feel free to DM me if you ever need someone to talk to
BPD,fjz3542,t3_ffiiy9,1583710294.0,"I hear you. 
I know you're not looking for advice but you are in recovery, you are TRYING and most importantly you're acknowledging your feelings and behaviors, that's fucking huge having that recognition. It's not always going to be like this for you"
BPD,fjyhybq,t3_ffhi1j,1583697138.0,It is always so painful to see peoples true colors. I think most people are able to hide dark parts of themselves for years before the truth comes out. I would try to not consider it a loss and more so a blessing that you weren't a victim of his cruelty and just hope that he gets the proper treatment he needs and to focus on your own healing in the meantime
BPD,fjyhko2,t1_fjygvmc,1583696907.0,"Yo, me either. I fucking ask that question all the time. Making new friends as an adult too, like how does one do that? 
It's not about how many friends you have, shit, even if you have one solid person in your life. It's the codependency aspect of things that makes it seem like it's not enough. I'm still trying to accept that about myself. That's why I've been trying to just indulge in hobbies as much as I can instead of obsessing over my lack of friends and yearning for support. Because yeah, even though I do have a couple people in my life I still have a void inside me no one can fill but myself. It's just a matter of figuring out how to do that and understanding it might take a long time. 
I'm also studying and have SUCH a hard time getting anything done and focusing because I'm so in my head constantly. 
Today is a bad day and that's ok. Tomorrow might me a completely different story, you might shift perspective later this evening, who knows. 
I hope you can get some studying done and be gentle with yourself. You aren't alone, I can relate with everything you shared"
BPD,fjyfzu9,t3_ffgkfg,1583695926.0,"I relate to most if not all of this. I don't want to sound  prototypical and say something like ""I'm sorry it'll get better"" especially since I have a hard time convincing that to myself. But it's true. 
I havent yet started DBT(I start at the end of the month) but from the extensive research I've done, and from what my therapist has shared with me, it is evident based. The only catch (my therapist told me this right off the bat) DBT is only successful if you don't have suicide on the back burner as a ""back up plan"". Which, I know, is hard to not have with BDP. So it takes a lot of perseverance and energy to effectively be treated by DBT, which god knows is an incredible challenge. But it is very doable. 
I guess that would be my advice regarding that part of things.
Having hobbies and an academic career is such a blessing even if it seems unphasing and unrewarding right now. Indulge all of your time and thought into these things, get better at your hobbies, let these things that you're gifted at consume you and give you purpose. 
My biggest struggles is making and maintaining friends, let alone worthwhile relationships and support, so I hear you loud and clear. Sometimes we just need to remind ourselves that just because we don't have as great of a social status as we would like that our lives arent valueless and that we are still good people deserving of love and support.
Not to be cheesy, and easier said than done, but finding that healing within ourselves and preoccuping our painful thoughts and idealations with learning healthy skills, hobbies, and hope is all we can do at the moment.
Nothing is permanent and I believe that you will overcome this with time and effort.
Be well."

BPD,fjxp5ma,t1_fjxorr5,1583679965.0,"It is only temporary I promise! 
I have found relief through herbal medicine that have taken a lot of edge off the depressive and anxiety symptoms I have. I know it's frustrating to go through treatments that make you feel worse or have no effect but you will find something that works for you. It took me a really long time to find relief and I'm not not 100%. DBT is supposed to be the most effective form of therapy for people with BDP, if you're not already doing it and if it is accessible to you maybe you could look into that instead of taking a medication route"
BPD,fjxooxd,t1_fjxof3c,1583679621.0,"What? No I didnt say your life was ruined at all..
Forced you to go on meds?
I've been on 15 different anti depressants in my life, that did nothing to me but give me lousy side effects, it's only temporary discomfort if anything. I was just saying that now that I know what my true diagnosis is, meds aren't helpful for me for the condition I have"
BPD,fjxnxce,t3_ffcvj2,1583679046.0,"Are you referring to medication? 
It can, unfortunately. 
If you have BPD alone, medication usually isnt a reliable/useful treatment. 
Meds are trial and error anyway, sometimes it takes multiple tries to find one that works for you and where the side effects are tolerable."
BPD,fjxmsml,t1_fjx6gpp,1583678179.0,"Yes! 
I am constantly confused because sometimes I think I am a completely ""normal"" high functioning person until I have a full on melt down or a wave of suicidal thoughts and even then I try to defend those feelings by saying ""anyone would be upset about this"" or something similar. And yes, that may be true, our feelings most of the time are validated, we just feel them 100x stronger than the next person. 
My negative emotions are always inward too, so from an outsider's perspective you probably wouldn't know the chaos going in inside of me"
BPD,fjxm1x7,t1_fjmqc7p,1583677597.0,"This was a really good response, I appreciate you taking the time to write that out.

BPD,fjmexr5,t3_fe7jk8,1583468741.0,"My mental disorder was misdiagnosed for over 10 years. I hear you. While medication can be vital for some psychiatric disorders, doctors are so quick to prescribe meds that can be incredibly harmful (especially if you are incorrectly diagnosed) a lot of people with BPD and OCD get DBT therapy which essentially helps you develop better coping mechanisms to what youre feeling and a better understanding of yourself. From experience, anti depressants and antipsychotic meds have made me feel 100 times worse. It's all about profit to some ""health care professionals"" 
. I reccomend the book ""saving normal:An Insider's Revolt Against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life"". As for ""finding your tribe"" even if you dont fit into one category right now, you still have support from this sub and any you feel like you resonate with.

BPD,fjm16nl,t3_fe4zja,1583459213.0,"Herbal medicine has been a God sent for me over the years. My favorite herbs (to steep into a tea) are passionflower, lemon balm, lavender, and oatstraw. Also KAVA! is amazing. You feel the effects almost immediately. I also like the brand Herb Pharm, they're the OG of herbal tinctures, they have a blend called Anxiety Soother that I've been taking for over 6 years, and Relaxing Sleep (you can take that during the day as well). GABA is another good option, you can get this in capsule or lozenge at a health food store- it's an essential amino acid that regulates calmness. I hope this helps! Be well ❤"

I think we all have a lot to be hopeful for, this is a condition not a disease. It's not permanent"
BPD,fjeiwxe,t1_fje6ws0,1583272534.0,I feel that. I havent told anyone about my diagnosis because I know I will have to explain myself in attempt to not be misunderstood or stigmatized to the condition
