mentalhealth,fl8efmy,t1_fl8e6oj,1584921807.0,I got back with her because I couldn’t handle the sorrow of her and myself. But when she came over I began to lose feeling for her and then broke it off again. She then faded away which is fair.

relationship_advice,feoyign,t1_feoycmv,1579308153.0,See I would do that but I have the anxiety of losing her or her getting more mad at me. I promised her we’d get through this together and we’d be okay. I also promised her we’d get married when we can. I love her so much and I honestly just think it’s a phase. But I will consider your advice if this keeps happening.
SuicideWatch,feoy21p,t1_feox9al,1579307870.0,My girlfriend had a breakdown 2 times this month because of stupid shut I’ve said like “ awe” and it made her go ape shit. And before that she went on about not liking the way I talk to her when I’m with friends. I’m so scared of losing her to suicide or just losing her from my relationship. It puts such a burden on my stress. I caved in today and cut myself till I could see the blood go down my leg. I’m so scared of what else I might do if this goes on or doesn’t get better. And I’m so scared to tell her about me cutting myself.
relationship_advice,feoxtcf,t1_feoxko6,1579307721.0,We just called and she said that me saying “awe” was like I don’t care and it pissed her off. Before hand she went on about how she was sad and didn’t know why so I didn’t know how to help her. And she said “ well it’s worth a shot to ask”  I’m so scared of losing her. And I even told her “we need to communicate” and she said “I didn’t want to talk to you after that” it hurts to hear that.

Everyone’s life is precious. Dm me if you need any help. I’ll be here."

mentalhealth,f95kr9z,t1_f93h94k,1575129906.0,If you’ve already given her a gift then not bringing her one is fine. And if you decide to bring another then she’ll really appreciate it. Even more so if your the only one. And if you know the people there you’ll definitely have a good time!
mentalhealth,f93fi6y,t3_e3fuu9,1575057722.0,If you cancel out of experiences you’ll never know what could happen. You could make a friend or have the time of your life. Don’t be scared to try new things. I believe in you!
mentalhealth,f93ext7,t3_e3iomp,1575057308.0,Not everyone is beautiful/handsome. But trust me there will be someone out there who will fall for you. Some girls like personality over looks. So if you have a good personality then you have raised your chances. Good luck. I believe in you!
