Adulting,fi69mae,t3_f6pfkw,1582184345.0,"Moved out at 19 & then back in at 20. Took the leap and just wasn’t ready. Lucky my parents were supportive of me trying & then falling back on them if I needed to. I’m 23, still finishing college & living at home. It all depends on how you feel & what is going to set you up for success when you move out. You shouldn’t move out just to move out & then be struggling because you’re on your own."
pregnant,fedkbjf,t3_eom7oh,1579013673.0,"I 1000% understand this. I wish that the workforce was more understanding to absences, not just with pregnancy but with mental health, minor physical health or just having a day to yourself. It is extremely frustrating to feel so misunderstood at 7 months pregnant missing work."
WeightLossAdvice,fe61g35,t1_fe60lx3,1578879649.0,"No, I don’t. Is this something I should do? I’ve done it before and sometimes I just get overwhelmed by counting the calories."
pregnant,fdpdv7s,t3_emc7a2,1578626121.0,Thank you all for sharing. This really helped me to know feel like I’m not alone.
medical,fd0zq6w,t3_ejtv08,1578125975.0,"That doesn’t seem normal. I am in with my chiropractor for a minimum of 30 minutes a visit. With adjustments and massaging treatments required for what I go to him for, it rarely falls under 30. It’s possible that you are receiving less than the norm because of the groupon. Don’t give up!! Try someone else."
mentalillness,fcukreo,t1_fcucxy5,1577983193.0,"Thank you so much for this. I never realize it until it happens, but ALL that I want is to feel understood, & you did exactly that."
medical,fctlrq5,t1_fctlktb,1577948056.0,No I do not currently have one.
pregnant,fcrxhey,t3_eimnwi,1577907971.0,I completely relate to this.
legaladvice,fcmvhfq,t3_ei21ux,1577794177.0,"Only advice I have is to possibly try to copy right the images. I’m not sure if it can be done for videos. But when/if he tries to post them, they will be flagged for copyright and taken down. The only downfall to this, is that you now have to register them with the government. Also, you could try to convince him you are underage, usually this tends to discourage those type of people from posting it, as they could get in trouble for it. Even at 17, posting underage nudes would get him in a great deal of trouble."
WeightLossAdvice,fb7ousm,t3_ebiecq,1576595872.0,"Thank you all for your answers! Just went to the doctor this morning & got some things figured out, like you guys said, it had a lot to do with my change in diet(from trying to lose weight)"
mentalillness,fb3q4ge,t3_eazyei,1576483241.0,This is so awesome! Sometimes it’s hard for me to even think about doing something like this because I’m constantly bombarded with the “what’s the point” thinking. How did you get motivation for this?
toxicparents,faszwtr,t1_fasvqnh,1576333293.0,"Thank you so much for responding, this really helped to put things into perspective."

mentalillness,fahj7u7,t1_fab9e29,1576086900.0,Thank you for responding. My therapist basically said the exact same thing today!
WeightLossAdvice,f6zyh05,t1_f6ye212,1573322284.0,"Possibly. I haven’t really thought about it. But I don’t drink alcohol, that was one of the first things I cut out."
WeightLossAdvice,f6s2gfw,t1_f6rxcyh,1573125406.0,That is so awesome for you! Thank you! I’ll try it out!
Adulting,f5wt80y,t1_f5wo69x,1572530166.0,"I could not have needed to hear this more. Thank you so much. I am 22, in college trying to finish my degree, but it seems like every time that I try to get motivated to break this cycle of poverty that I’m in, I get shot down because of bad situational luck."
pregnant,f46fsfg,t3_dbasbu,1571408212.0,"Just coming back to this thread, because I am now a week late for my period, given the circumstances I already explained, should I go ahead and schedule a doctors appointment to get things checked out or take an at home test first."
pregnant,f1zp7ae,t1_f1zoznz,1569847268.0,Thank you!! (Those were doctors orders to experiment with things unfortunately) Do you think that it would be too early to get an accurate reading?
pregnant,f1zowfw,t1_f1zor28,1569847106.0,"Okay, thank you!"
pregnant,f1zopiu,t1_f1zojlt,1569846996.0,My cycle is fairly irregular because I have been changing and on and off of birth control the past 6 months. So I don’t really know what to expect.
pregnant,f1zogpk,t1_f1zof18,1569846862.0,"Well it was in the same day, so I wasn’t sure."
pregnant,f1zo9pr,t1_f1znv8r,1569846754.0,"It’s a tricky situation to try to gauge, because I had been off of my birth control for about 2 months prior & only it took it about 3 times the week before this happened. So no condom, no birth control and did not pull out. This same kind of unprotected sex happened 5-6 times in the days leading up to the day I had my period."
WomensRights,f1spqm7,t1_f1sp6ao,1569732288.0,"Thank you so much for responding! 

1. I am in Ohio, and he is in Texas.
2. No, I am 22.
3. The last time I had contact with him was around 8pm tonight.
4. Yes, I have screenshots of him telling me to comply with what he wanted from him or he’d sell the content."
