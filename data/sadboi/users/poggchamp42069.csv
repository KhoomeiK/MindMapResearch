offmychest,f0hax48,t1_f0fra02,1568617160.0,Yes I know some girls were taught this but some like the idea of hitting men cause they don't get in trouble for it I'm not saying all girls do just that a large amount do.
SuicideWatch,f0hapva,t1_f0fra8q,1568617002.0,You seem to be confused that wasn't a question
SuicideWatch,f0fr4uz,t1_f0fmwuw,1568587931.0,You are just gonna block someone for having a different opinion real mature I hope everyone will one day be as smart as you
SuicideWatch,f0fqtbw,t3_d4r8lm,1568587798.0,I do and I start beating the shit out of myself phisicaly and mentaly
offmychest,f0fq8xc,t3_d4reis,1568587533.0, Racism and sexism go both ways but a lot of people don't realise like men can't hit girls but if a woman hits a man then he just needs to deal with it. That is sexist if a woman hits a man she should expect nothing less back.
depression,f0fpbk3,t3_d4rhak,1568587092.0,Dude I'm being honest I can't help you and neither can anyone else here if you want to get better you have to do something just don't get to the point where your hitting family members and screaming at them and threatening them get help don't hold shit inside don't live a lie
SuicideWatch,f0foltu,t3_d4rhls,1568586756.0,"I shouldnt have to live and suffer to spare others I have spent my whole life pleasing them can I not do one thing just for myself? Why should I live only so others don't have to face the fact that the people who bullied me and treated me like shit for my whole 15 fucking years of life contributed to this? I do not want to stay alive anymore. Let that sink in, read it out loud I no longer want to live I do not want to breathe I only want to die. Some bulshit sob story doesn't affect anyone except make you feel better about yourself. I know you only want to help people with depression but trying to guilt people into living is wrong no matter the context."

SuicideWatch,exw5k0x,t1_exw4rsn,1566613137.0,Just remember that just because you don't have a reason to live right now doesn't mean there isn't one at all and I'm sure you will find it.
depression,exw4i52,t1_exw3coi,1566612505.0,Thank you dude
SuicideWatch,exw3l5b,t3_cunbx3,1566611776.0,Look bro I know that it seem hopeless but you were fucking good enough to get on an esports team I know the stress that they put on players and the chronic feeling of emptyness is unbearable but you are amazing I look up to people like you I practiced 9 hours a day in hope I could someday be as good as you guys are. I know you may feel empty but maybe esports just wasn't the way for you I know it feels like you will always be a hollow shell of a person and I know how shitty it feels trust me but you are worth more than suicide at 21 it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to become a high level player of any game and these attributes make you worth more than your depression alone.
