schizoaffective,fbf14po,t1_fbcsb3t,1576798876.0,"If you must, I'd have to suggest DMT or ketamine. To me, the drugs that are scariest from the point of view of psychosis are the ones where you're up and about for hours, interfacing with the real world. These will blend hallucination and reality and might cause you to do or think crazy shit. DMT and ketamine are more dissociative and they generally knock you out on your bed while the relatively short trip occurs. You get a powerful trip, but it's removed from your person and the real world, more like a dream. Please treat these with respect, especially ketamine, which has a physical toll and can get you in trouble (you don't want an upset stomach while sedated...)"
schizoaffective,fbf0oj1,t3_ecncdb,1576798553.0,"I'm a neurotypical adult with a family history of schizophrenia and various psychoses.

Having done a few psychedelic drugs, I've gotta say that LSD is the one that makes me feel like I'm shaking hands with my latent schizophrenia, or at least waving to it from across the way. It's a manic feeling where I come up with weird delusions and perspectives and go through repetitive motions on occasion. It's a very fun drug for me but I've grown really cautious about it, it's just uncomfortably close to how schizophrenia is described.

I've never had this suspicion with shrooms (which mostly just make me anxious and sad), DMT, or Ketamine."
RationalPsychonaut,f02dvtt,t3_d390xv,1568328549.0,"I think this drug is less popular here, but I'm going to mention ketamine.

If I had to describe them in an easy reductive way, I'd say that shrooms helps your mind be happy, ketamine helps your brain be happy. My second ketamine trip felt like my brain ""remembering"" how to use it's happiness reserves to the best extent, like cleaning out some clogged neurons. I don't do it anymore but those first few sessions were very positive and important to me.

It is much closer to the sort of drug that cartoons and parents warned you about, though. It has real dangers and physical discomforts, and health risks for heavier or long term use. Do your homework and be really damn careful. Do not mix with alcohol, ever. Hell, don't even mix it with greasy foods. You 100% do not want an upset stomach while this stuff is sedating you."

For real though those roads are rough no matter what vehicle you're on. And for this part of the country I just loaded up my bicycle into riverboats, so not much to brag about...Totally worth it though."
