Though, talking in person hasn't been the best for me. My voice breaks a lot and I have trouble speaking and getting all my thoughts out. I graduate this semester, though, so I hope I'll have enough time to make some kind of change for the better. I was able to talk to her a few times and my parents never knew about it. My 7th period was a free period so I would visit her then every Wednesday. But then it stopped, and I'm not sure why. I'll try it again, though I'm not sure when. Hopefully tomorrow, if I can gather enough courage to go up to her and ask for meetings again.

Thank you"

BackYardChickens,f4ab20f,t3_djzdta,1571491656.0,"Update (plus question):

This morning, I opened the door to their chicken coop and let them out into their run. Our 3 welsummers were all up and ready to forage, though it took them a few seconds to get out of their coop. They all looked really cautious. Our white rock was still sitting on the roosting bar with our second faverolle. After a bit of nudging, she eventually got up and (very carefully) made her way down to the run.

Our darker faverolle didn't move, though. She didn't even look at me or the other hens. I'm afraid she's either depressed from the loss if a flock member or still scared from the attack. Is there anything I can do to help her?"
