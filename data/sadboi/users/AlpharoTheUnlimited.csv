It’s really more of a feeling the story gives off than anything but, the developers released a passion project that “no one” cared about, and all they see from their “loyal” fans is how much we want to see borderlands 3 already. 

It feels like they crudely taped together a story, blatantly formatted by borderlands 2 and stapled passive aggressive connotations to it. Including, but not limited to villainizing streamer tropes, lazy writing(with small exceptions), and painfully repetitive catchphrases. 

Don’t get me wrong, I spent a hundred dollars on the game and don’t regret it. The gameplay is fluid and it truly FEELS like borderlands. But it’s story was the equivocal result of making your kid read as a form of punishment"

Hypocrite or not, she was right. You can invalidate the source of valid information, but it doesn’t make the information itself, any less valid. Consider she hadn’t been doing cocaine and said the same thing? Then you could invalidate her by exclaiming she’s not truly involved with the family so she cant know just how hard it is to get out of a life like that.  Edit: But what she was claiming, is still not any more nor less true than it was before.

At the end of the day, regardless of her actions, she never really called bullshit on anything that wasn’t exactly that. And that’s why people hated her. Arthur really was too far gone to save when she left, and that was proven by his actions with the teacher. “I am a good man.” That was him closing the door on his own hope for himself."

Given the hazardous environment the men always create(mostly on behalf of Tommy’s PTSD), Id say the women are better than most would be in their situation. 

Arthur’s wife though, that chick was awesome. Rightfully Argumentative, but awesome. Arthur isn’t a “material” kind of man, so everything he did was for the family.  His wife’s problem, was that she saw that Tommy was just using his brother as a soldier, and there was no amount of money or bullshit, that could come between that empirical truth. She can’t be silenced like Tommy could do to anyone else. She only really settles out of respect for the situation, and her husband.

Unfortunately, her husband was never going to do what was best for him. And that’s why things turned out the way they did. But she, is the kind of wife people should aspire to be. Arthur was the one who really ruined everything for himself... I was really rooting for her too."

It would begin with, “Do what you’re supposed to do. And all will fall into place.” I imagine we would grow through community chores that the city is normally supposed to be fulfilling. This provides a sense of purpose greater than one’s self, which is the root of a cult. It’s a truly beautiful desire that’s easily corruptible. I think we’d eventually end up becoming some kind of nomadic settlement, kind of like communism in an agriculturally rich location where people don’t starve as long as you, “do what you’re supposed to do.” This would only work with me as the leader or “philosopher’s king,” a truly selfless person with the intentions of societal progress in mind. 

Unfortunately, I’d most likely end up murdered by some form of a council or right hand person, as a power grab... and that’s how the cult would really start to go down hill. That’s the real problem with cults, they always end in the exploitation of people’s desire to be a part of something greater. “Do what you’re supposed to do,” implies that they have the inner strength to decide for themselves what they are “supposed to do.”
But only a truly incorruptible person can properly lead a mission like that.

At 15, all you need is a Hollister hoodie. 

By 18, it helps to have a car and at least some half cocked trending aspiration(YouTuber, rockstar, travel journalist, photographer).

By 21, you can maintain status either through the prospect of your major in college. If you went the no college route, you can move out of your parents, to a place where you can throw parties at. 

By 23, you‘re still allowed to be in your partying phase, but they’re gonna start getting less fun and more crazy, as the people you actually like start putting themselves together as adults and you’re left partying with the stragglers. The quality people are figuring it out. This is when you start having to really put in effort to continue attracting, “women of quality.”

By 25, you should be out of college, or done partying with the prospects of buying property for yourself that you can spend the rest of your life maintaining. If you make under 40k a year, you’ll be completely undesirable to anyone who is conventionally attractive. 

I have a feeling I’m gonna get horribly downvoted for this, so must make it clear, that I am not stating my opinion as much as just declaring the glaringly obvious structure of social status where I live. This is simply the straight forward guide on how to attract women on an egregiously General spectrum as you progress through your twenties.

The swirling spirits pour into his vessel and he manifests into a decrepit skeletal humanoid with flesh rotting off the bone. His eyes green with the energy of the past souls he reserves once again. 

Basically, the ruin was once used as a pool of souls that belonged to a powerful Lich, he was once a devoted Paladin alongside his brother, but after much research into the powers evil could possess, he denounced his oath and pursued the Dark Arts. His extensive knowledge on divine magic made him nigh unstoppable. The crystal swiped by the rogue happened to contain the soul of the Liches brother. Who had expelled his brother from the once established temple using the force of will his own soul carried,  to imposes that no malice shall ever traverse the temple grounds ever again.

I’m paraphrasing, but they went to the town they were near to, just so they could find out that this is a local folk tale. A statue stands tall, in honor of the brave man who paid for the safety of their lands with the strength of his own soul. It was just a little extra salt for the wound, as the clouds above roar with the same green hue that sat in the eyes of this lich they now feel obligated to stop"

Borderlands,f46yikw,t3_djopss,1571415103.0,"I’m glad somebody said it. I personally enjoy being part of the community who gets to contribute to the balance of a game. This is what has to happen so we don’t end up with near unusable weapons like in Borderlands 2 with Jakob’s and most Dahl weapons. The more feedback they get, the better the game ends up in the long run. 

That’s what this October promotion has been about the whole time. To keep people playing the game while they go under the hood and tune the game.  I personally prefer a game with more options than Beehawk, Unkempt Harolding with every character.

I’m sure an actual update will come out soon with some interface fix as well to keep us from lagging so much in the pause screen. We should be reinforcing good behavior, this is far better than an alternative of just leaving a game imperfect. I do understand that people put a lot of time into farming, but from what I can gather the guns work plenty fine even after the nerfs. They just don’t melt bosses in 15 seconds"
