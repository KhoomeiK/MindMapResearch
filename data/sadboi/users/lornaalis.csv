Don't let her out unless leashed. Give her high value treats every time anyone walks by. (Adjust meal times to not overfeed ). Give this AS SOON as she notices them. Keep her attention on you until they are gone. You want to make her associate people with awesome fun things, as well as looking to you every time it happens.

This may be easier to do in short sessions if you had some friends who could walk by, but that may not be possible in the current climate.

Anyway once she is consistently looking to you for treats you can start to ramp it up a bit by getting closer to the fence, with some obedience like sit stay, or coming back to you, before eventually letting her off the leash."
