Today he walked up to me and told me “you realize a lot of people here are worried about you, you don’t act the same, joke around or even talk anymore”

OMG!! This totally happened to me as well with a person I was so close to it’s been a month as well since we even talked and he goes about acting like there’s nothing wrong and that things are all okay that he chose to distance himself from me and do other hurtful things... he even said the same thing your ex friend said, and I actually replied as to how do YOU expect me to act?! I’ve basically lost a close friend who doesn’t seem to care that I’m hurting at the least.

*hugs* I know it’s hard especially when someone you really cared about treats you like crap but it just shows their true colours and how they really are. I’m coming to realize that well, I guess I dodged a bullet if thats how they treat someone especially someone close to them. :/"

I can understand why your friend would be so hurt that her best friend of 10 years wouldn’t be there for her special day— its like once in a lifetime and you would think that that person would put you first. BUT to be fair to you because of circumstances and the job opportunity I understand that you are looking out for yourself as well. It is still fresh and emotions are still high one day she will realize the importance of your decision and hopefully will take you into consideration as well and what was better for you at the time that you didnt INTEND to hurt her.

Be real, be honest and you just need to accept the consequences of that choice. Whether or not she’ll have hard feelings afterwards. :) 
Sorry if it comes off as a but harsh but ye, its just my opinion if that were me, I would rather someone be honest and say outright they dont wanna be my friend vs someone who is hanging out with me out of pity and just tolerating me, you’re not respecting the person if you do that.

I know that hurts and I know its hella painful as I can tell from the post you truly cared for this person. But in the end, these types of people need to make a decision themselves.l and sadly from what I can see they are too wrapped up in their own problems that they really can’t be considerate to other people. That is not a friend you want especially one that tells you they are sick of you or tired of you? It’s time to let him go already and don’t contact him maybe in time he will see the error of his ways but that will be your choice to take him back. I think tho that yeah maybe you do have anxiety issues I understand at that time you chased him because you were panicking you felt you were losing someone so important to you and yeah, maybe all he needed was space so it didn’t really help. What’s done is done though and he still hurt you thats the important thing here.

Im kinda going through something like this with a friend of mine, but we were never in a romantic relationship. I hope one day that we would be able to reconcile but right now where he is at and how much hurt I’ve endured from his end I dont see that happening anytime soon. Taken the fact that he is no longer speaking to me as well and that they have removed me from all social media stuff. 

I understand you said that your friend is going through something too, you mentioned depression. But at this time maybe a romantic relationship isnt something he can handle maybe he just needs a friend for now? But if he keeps letting you down well, if you are okay with that treatment then go ahead. If not, then you need to be around people who don’t hurt you and who actually value you.

Im sorry youre going theough this. i kind of recently went through this but in my scenario didnt end well mostly because he other person didnt want to work on fixing things with me. But I hope your friend values you enough to actually still want a friendship.
