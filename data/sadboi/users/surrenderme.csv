That’s what they did for me and nothing helped so when I was 16 I got prescribed Xanax.

A long time ago in pee wee football I had to lose 25 pounds in 2 and a half weeks to make the weight limit for my age group (I was always very tall and a little bigger then most as a kid). And I actually lost 30 pounds! I honestly didn’t change my diet much, I just cut out all the greasy and processed shit and stuff that is obviously unhealthy. I honestly didn’t change much about my food choices, I ate 3 meals a day in smaller portions then usual and never ate any snack in between (harder then it seems). I worked out twice everyday, ran 2 miles and did 200 reps of pushups, sit-ups and crunches all in sets of 20 throughout the day. I also found what helped the most is drinking an absurd amount of water and absolutely no sugary drinks under any circumstance. Water actually helps loose weight wayyyyy more then anyone would expect. A majority of people don’t drink nearly enough water as your suppose to and honestly that’s one thing I never stopped doing.
