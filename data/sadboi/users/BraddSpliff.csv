FLMedicalTrees,fr2ope8,t1_fr2i8i9,1589841025.0,"Got done about ten minutes ago! Simple process. They have tutorial on their site. My atomizer looked different than the one on the site though so I had to look up reference in YouTube. Well it started out a bit u sure of how sensitive and delicate I need to treat things, but soon got a feel for the process. The tool of the wire cutter is useful but I found myself searching For a mini glasses screwdriver to remove the og grommet.  It was stuck in there. 
But overall the process was actually simple and was over before I thought I was done. Very easy just follow instructions. I just took a dab and I feel like I took my first one! 😍😍😍🏆🏆🏆💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💨💨💨"

BlackMentalHealth,fqyupxv,t3_gljhzg,1589754873.0,"Much strength and perseverance your way! I’m where you are at mentally and I too am exhausted. I think anywhere u can recharge your mental batteries and find daily uber and outer peace is where you should try to be for at least a week. You def need to connect to the earth and try grounding for at least 15 minutes a day and connect to earth/soil barefoot. 
Take the time to align yourself with your true path. I believe in you and I’m right here with you. I’m a daily jogger but since lockdown it’s changed and especially since recent shooting in the news. I feel like I was such a bright eyed openly accepting human being. But I feel like these things are shaping me into a more rigid soul. It’s so hard being this color and acting like you too have an even playing field in the corporate world."

So I’m curious for those who have tried both how did it go
