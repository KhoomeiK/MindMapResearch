She'd always tell me I never had it that bad because she didn't beat me, and if I was ever emotional it was because I just wasn't as strong as her (same lady that'd drunk cry after nights out with her girlfriends locked in the bathroom asking me if she was a failure of a mother).

Do you know if mental illness runs in your family? I think my moms borderline, and I unfortunately think I may also be (but I'm getting help and take medicine).

Aside from the basics...6 year olds are good about expressing their needs. Depending on how mature he is, he may not need much help with things like bathing, getting changed, etc..but still offer to help. If he refuses it, still watch to make sure he's actually okay.

No one can tell you how you're supposed to feel right now.

I'll look back at the happy memories, and that'll just make it hurt worse because for every good memory, there were 20 bad ones, and I watched her slowly kill herself for decades with chain smoking, alcoholism, and generally just being a bitter person. 

Just try and remind yourself what led you to going NC in the first place, as much anger as that may bring...it's okay to feel things, especially right now. 

In my case, I'm an only child that still feels a lot of guilt for going NC since I sometimes feel like I've abandoned my mom. But I remind myself that I did try, I tried to help. I tried to offer advice, I tried to be there. But the toxic relationship wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth feeling even worse every time I talked to her. It wasn't worth the drama.

My mom's family was pretty well mapped out already, but my father's wasn't. There was a lot of spoken lure and photos of them, but not much else beyond my grandfather. It was very exciting mapping out his roots! Traced us back to his ancestor's coming to America in the late 1600s!"
OutOfTheLoop,fa8m3f6,t3_e7w18n,1575849388.0,"Answer: Sometimes, but not always. I work in the auction industry (not specialized in artwork but we get a fair amount of it in the $2,000-$10,000 price range but rarely above that) and art is one of the trickiest things to put a price tag or an estimate on. I have seen things that I expected to fetch at least $1,000 barely break $200, and I've also seen pieces of literally just bent metal pieces arranged in a vague flower formation bring $3,000. 

Where I have seen likely scams involving pieces of art and other collectibles that are worth next to nothing sell for hundreds is eBay. When I'm researching the value of something and I check the sold results, and I see this one vinyl sell consistently for about $2-$5 suddenly shoot up to $500, that's probably a scam...or human error, but I see enough of it to imagine there's something going on. Especially if their history shows many examples like that."

I forgot what even brought it up but she said something along the lines of ""You gotta love your mom! That's blood, that's family!"" I was explaining to her that I had been pretty much NC with my nmom for a few months at that point. I explained all the issues I was having with her leading to me going NC and the co-worker said that was all the more reason to be there for her as she was struggling yadda yadda. What sucked was at that time I was still second guessing my decision and guilting myself for not being there for my mom."

AskReddit,f95gapm,t3_e3vg54,1575127136.0,"Back in 2007 I was making my first World of Warcraft character, an Undead Rogue. I used the randomize name thingy and most of them sucked. I settled with altering one of the randomized names to Venthemia. Venthemia was my main until Wrath came out. Most of my guild shortended Venthemia to Venthie, so when it was time to make my Blood Elf Death Knight, I named her Venthie. After that it just slowly became my handle for most things since all my online gaming buddies knew me by Venthie at that point. 

I actually have grown really tired of the name, and I've tried using other handles...but I'm inevitably called Venthie even if I'm using another handle. I tried using a new name in FFXIV, and even my husband was confused when my character's name wasn't Venthie. He called me Venthie in our FC discord..and guess what, I'm known as Venthie there too. My discord handle isn't even Venthie!"

When shopping for a new sweater for myself I can go to any given site or store and find at least 5 things I like, he was trying to just find a new winter coat and it took him six days to find one he liked (And it's nearly identical to mine..his was still more expensive)"

insanepeoplefacebook,f55dets,t1_f54atw8,1572005350.0,"I love it! I just kind of stumbled into this field after getting referred to a place hiring catalogers for a strictly online auction house. We cataloged based off pictures/basic attribute notes, and I was eventually able to work from home. The company started going under & I was laid off, but I eventually did find a similar job at a local auction house with better pay. 

In my job I handle drop-off consignments or people calling about consignment. Usually it's an older person downsizing or someone handling a family member's estate. Most items are sold ""on floor"" so they don't need cataloged, but we pull nicer or more unique items to auction off through an online platform. I write up the description for those items. We get everything from basically thrift store junk to high end antiques, just had a rare comic book sale with a first appearance of Iron Man, have some original 1960s psychedelic concert posters coming up too. When I first started I wasn't super familiar with most of the items, but you learn over time and just knowing how to look up the stuff & knowing how to find the sold price trends is useful.  

The biggest downfall is it's a very small field, almost every auction house needs someone like me, but there's only so many auction houses. I got lucky with where I'm at now as the girl I was replacing left to be a stay at home mom. The job was posted about 2 weeks after I was laid off. If this place falls through I'm probably going to look into becoming a certified appraiser for estates."

I was consistently 15 minutes late, and they wrote me up and told me to just leave school earlier. I was thankfully living with my parents at the time but if I wasn't I probably would have had to drop the class.

talesfromcallcenters,f55ai4c,t3_dmuizw,1572003649.0,"I worked primarily as a text-based customer service rep for a company that handled a lot of refunds & shipping complaints, occasionally I'd have to hop on the phones and assist with calls too. I learned pretty quick that there is a certain point of a call, or even an email conversation, that you realize there is absolutely nothing more you can do to help this customer any further. Usually it's things that are absolutely out of our control, or they just aren't getting it and you can't waste anymore time with them. Usually those two were actually one in the same, it was usually an issue their bank could resolve as we did everything on our end, or an issue with UPS. I provided lots of screenshots of what I was seeing on our system, put them on hold to say I was checking with another department or something, and would just end it with ""Sir/Ma'am there's nothing further I can do on my end, you will need to contact XYZ to assist you with this matter further, I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused but please feel free to contact me if the issue still is not resolved in such&such business days"" 9/10 I wouldn't get a callback.

My mom's almost 60, and I've had real concerns that she may have some of the early signs of dementia, the problem is she says she's fine and blames it on stress. I don't think she'd be very receptive to help since she thinks its normal. I haven't looked into what it takes to have social services do a well visit on her but I do know it would 100% set her off. She doesn't cope well and never has, she was always co-dependent on my dad or found another convenient scapegoat to blame her troubles on."

He didn't give a fuck that I smoked weed, just doesnt care for the smell. So I came back in the room one day, stood at the door for like five seconds, he asked if I was good...and I just straight faced told him ""I can feel the psychology in my brain"" I smoke to help with my anxiety and mood stability, so what I was trying to explain was that I was stoned, and it was working.

My nmom still insists she was a great mom because I turned out okay & she never hit me. To this day most of her friends and a good chunk of my family still think I'm exaggerating and ungrateful just because the abuse isn't visible. Thankfully a small number of her friends have called her out on it, but she'll always play victim and twist it as if I'm the bad guy. It's even harder to get people to understand because I'm an only child, so I endured it all alone with zero support or backup, sometimes my dad would try to stick up for me against her, but he was also controlled by her. My cousins on her side have been a big support mostly because their father (her brother) physically abused them so totally get how fucked up the family is. We're all grown up & have our own children now...and we're proudly breaking the cycle & trying to give our children the best lives we can despite our shitty upbringing. Keeping the nparents as far away as possible really helps. Cut toxicity out of your life."
