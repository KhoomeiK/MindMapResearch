SuicideWatch,fpkqhpr,t1_fpjyfd5,1588699268.0,">painfully writhing around for hours

you say that you're going to be honest and yet you tell blatant  lies just to terrorize people, 
in no possible way can someone who hanged themselves (with their bodies dangling in the air) stay conscious for hours, yes it can take up to 15 minutes in some cases but most lose conscious in a minute or two, 
as methods discussion is agaisnt this sub rules, I think over exaggerating stuff just to scare people should be agaisnt the rules too."
SuicideWatch,fpbm7vd,t3_gcb0sp,1588473263.0,"hey I used to play a lot of visual novels ( basically a novel with static images and soundtrack programmed into a game where the only thing you can do is choose your path in the story) and the first thing I always notice is how far different the reading experience is when you have a soundtrack designed specifically for your novel instead of the normal reading experience, it's just far more immersive, so I think your idea of producing a soundtrack for your novel is truly remarkable and amazing, maybe with the help of an artist and a programmer you can pursue such market (it's actually has a fairly big audience, especially in japan) and then you can publish your game on steam, some developers start with free games to gain popularity and then rely on merch  licensing and donations, there's actually a free game called doki doki literature club that gained an immense popularity (one of the biggest in its year) 3 years ago for its weird story that fluctuates between normal high scool romance and horror stories, and like I said it was just a novel with soundtrack that provided weird story twists."
