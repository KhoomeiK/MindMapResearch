After a decade of being completely alone every single holiday, you might miss being around them. When the option is gone. It's gone forever. Take a picture. Remember how fucked up or annoying it was. It's a story you can retell. There is no story when there is nobody there."
depression,fc10ykl,t3_effx75,1577305130.0,"I'm single, not that old and my family is all dead - parents, sibling, grandparents... My friends are all out of town or with their families. I was invited by some friends to join them, but it just reminds me of what I don't have and makes it more painful. 

I don't like holidays. I've spent almost every holiday alone for the past decade. I just try and sleep through them and wish they were done so I  can get back to normal days so I can see my friends and go out somewhere.

All holidays are bad for a lot of people and we are forced to be reminded of what we don't have. But they are only one day. If you can get through one day the next might be better. I'm glad I managed to get through all the holidays last year because the other days held some amazing surprises and more joy than I've ever found at Christmas.

Only half a day to go..."

Imagine meeting a woman who likes being just your friend every single time. And even those who would be intimate with a total stranger in a bathroom still dont find you actractive."
