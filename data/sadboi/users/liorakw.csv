mentalhealth,flv2iek,t1_flv2403,1585515023.0,hmm theres an app that i use called calm harm which helps with urges to self harm so that might help with those particular impulses and there might be similar apps for dealing with impulsiveness in general but im not too sure
mentalhealth,flv0onc,t3_frc367,1585513952.0,is the impulsiveness constant or is it an on and off this bc impulsiveness esp financial impulses can be a sign of a manic episode...either way i would probably try to talk to your psychiatrist &/or therapist to see if you could work on some strategies to control the impulsiveness

AmItheAsshole,fd6he6h,t3_ek6h4a,1578191050.0,"ESH kind of you’re dad most definitely but your concerns and intentions definitely well intentioned but thats news that should  be coming from your parents not you, also if you havent told your parents about his bio mom creeping around the school you probably should bc even if shes not dangerous she shouldnt be hanging around a school trying to see your brother - she should be going to talk to your dad or a judge to see him."

Anxiety,f4oxppu,t3_dlamgy,1571710807.0,I really love mine. I have a 20 pound one I got from Amazon. Even if it still takes me a while to fall asleep once I do I don’t wake up in the middle of the night nearly as often as a used to. I’ve heard some people say it stopped helping them after they adjusted to the weight But in my opinion even if after a while you get used to it and you kind of stop noticing its  benefits it’s  actually still helping bc any time I go on on overnight trip somewhere or back to my family’s house I immediately notice the weighted blanket’s absence when I try to go to sleep and kind of revert back to my old sleeping habits.

AmItheAsshole,f2ezfd3,t3_dcess4,1570207076.0,"YTA - if you have concerns about your stepdaughter's behavior esp her behavior towards you, cutting down the amount of time she gets to be with her dad will probably make it worse. In one paragraph it sounds like your trying to force a motherly relationship on her and the next it sounds like she's a burden to you. Find a middle ground and it'll be easier for you to ""cope with her behavior"""

UnsentLetters,eynzlb9,t1_eynz0su,1567266007.0,"Considering the fact that you referenced yourself as “being that daughter/sister” and that your family hated you for years I am going to disagree when you claim you didn’t reference your own situation.
At the end of the day you’re not going to change my opinion and I’m not going to change yours. So if I’m not worth respecting- don’t respect me and leave me alone."
UnsentLetters,eynyhfi,t1_eynw0dx,1567265128.0,"I never said that they were the same. But I know what I know and I feel how I feel.And you don’t have the right to dictate wether or not my family is being dishonest, or wether or not my father was the one who was manipulative and cruel based off of what happened to YOU. The police and medical records describing the things that she did were valid. The countless calls from people trying to find out where she is were valid. The feelings and experiences of the rest of my older siblings and the rest of my family were  are valid. No matter what her perspective is it doesn’t change the fact that for 17 years people waited for her and hoped for her and the person who clung onto that hope the most is dead. I’m sorry your family hated you for so long and that your father was the way he was but every situation is different and just because you went through something similar doesn’t mean you get to dictate how I feel or how I think."

I know that she lied and manipulated everyone she met. I know that she would cheat and steal from people, anything ranging from their clothes to their car. I know that people tried to help her and support her but she chose to be spiteful. Our dad wasn’t always great, but he always tried.
I don’t know you and I don’t know your situation but my sister gets no sympathy from me."

I never really thought a lot about it because it’s been happening since I was a kid, until I realized it wasn’t completely “normal”. I just assume it’s some kind of depersonalization/dissociation."

So for the next five or so minutes they stand right in front of that table blocking the server trying to get to their tables and forcing me to bus the tables while a line builds up with people at the host stand waiting to be seated. Because “No we don’t want the table over there that’s nearly identical, we want this exact one.”  I can get over it when people seat themselves whenever it’s slow but I haaaaate when people want dirty tables. That and when I seat them but the moment I walk away they get up and move somewhere else."

depression_memes,epwk5bo,t1_epwhejl,1559577868.0,"Hi! Actually a significant amount of research studies show that there are genetic links underlying most psychiatric disorders, including ones like depression and anxiety. So if anyone in your family, especially if it’s one of your parents, there’s an increased risk of you also developing a psychiatric disorder. While the genetic correlation is lower in more common disorders it’s still there, and the correlation increases significantly when looking at more severe disorders, especially when looking at personality disorders. Also knowing wether or not a family member also suffers from some kind of mental health issue impacts how people decide to deal with their own. People are more likely to be more open with their parents/family about their mental health when they know the other person has had similar experiences because they feel like that person would be able to understand. But if you’re from a family that isn’t open about mental health issues you’re more likely to isolate yourself and not  talk about it because there’s a fear of them not being able to understand what you’re going through and having your own family perpetuate really harmful stigmas surrounding mental illness. So even if there wasn’t any genetic link it’s still important for your family to be honest about their history with mental health just from a communication standpoint"
