offmychest,fbwyxgk,t1_fbwy41d,1577163353.0,"I know, I have a problem. My family haven't noticed it, even when I flat out mentioned it. I guess because I'm usually jovial people don;t associate me with having serious mental issues or struggling with an addiction but I don't have any real desire to stop. I mean, why stop? I know that I could choose to change my life, turn it into something good but I've tried that.

People never gave me a chance to prove that I am good, nor that I could do good. Because they listen to my mother or choose to judge me for what she does, or some lie they've told themselves, every year I end up alone and if I have something to mourn? I'm dealing with it alone.

One of my friends recently died, killed in a horrific accident and all anyone could say to me was that her death 'doesn't matter as much' to me because her son and I can't see eye to eye. A couple people weren't shitty to me about it and comforted me, but being told I don't care hurt. I can't go to her funeral because her son (my old friend) doesn't want me there.

It's one more thing to my life that I want to forget.

You're right there though, people do care and that's obvious (hell, I don't even know who you are and I feel like someone gives a rat's ass). Just I wish people could try to get to know me before they assume things, they'd be surprised about how I actually felt.

Thank you you made a difference in my life, believe it or not. I don't know when I'll stop drinking, but hopefully I could find a way sooner than later."

The person that they didn't really know? Or the person they thought they knew? 

I don't want to kill myself, I just can't find the reason to care bout my health, you know? When I drink, I'm happy. When I don't, shit just gets bad for me.

It always depends on what you let turn you into a cruel person or seek the help (not always prof, just self reflection is very important), and make a choice on how to treat people. Doesn't mean they have to be 100% kind to people, just don't make them feel less than you or defend being a njerk for the rest of their lives. You know?"

Getting therapy and deciding to seek help instead of harming others is always an option. If someone is a total jerk to me, I'm not going to let them into my life because they can't decide to treat others better or just leave them alone.

If people don't want to seek help, that's their choice. But you can't blame people for pushing them away because of what they do."

Because I don't feel entitled to treat people badly because I have been.
