I won't go into detail, because it's incredibly disturbing, but the game is sort of a Saw inspired thing. You, as the generic protagonist, are in a strange room with several other people you know. Being a visual novel game, most of the details are written out, rather than seen or heard (there are some messed up images from the game though, if you think you can stomach it,) but the idea is that you have to obey a disembodied voice telling you to torture the others in a variety of...""creative"" ways. It's the only fictional thing I've ever seen that actually made me sick to my stomach, and I think it predates DDLC and even Corpse Party, making it one of the first visual novels to be blacklisted due to disturbing content. It's a hard game to find because it violates a lot of rules, but if you do find it, I recommend you avoid playing it. I get queasy when I think about what I saw in that gameplay, I don't want to imagine what playing it feels like."
