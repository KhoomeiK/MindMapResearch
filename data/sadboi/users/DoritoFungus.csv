What has helped me is to detach. A couple years ago he fell and was in ICU and a nursing home and I was going through a very stressful time in my own life. My mom was giving me regular updates (""he ate two peas today""- that was an actual text) and I finally had to tell her to only tell me if it was something I needed to know.  It doesn't mean I don't care; it just means I am prioritizing my own life.

I can't ""fix"" him.  He's an adult. He has a higher power and it's not me. His disease is killing him, but I don't have to let myself be dragged down by it too. I just try to enjoy the time I've got left with him."
