Advice,fpe5y2m,t3_gcldyz,1588541009.0,"Honestly, I’m so happy you’re willing to do your best for trans people. Many wouldn’t do that! If I’ve learned anything, it can be hard? especially if you knew a person before they transitioned. The thoughts you had in your head is completely normal, so don’t worry! Just do your best to keep respecting people and their pronouns, and it’ll just come easier to you!"

It’s been causing nightmares almost every night and it really sucks ;-;  The urges to binge are also very very prominent which is not helping."
eating_disorders,fn6icgh,t3_fzvqby,1586700058.0,"Hunny. It’s completely okay to relapse. It happens, and it’s a completely normal thing for recovery. What matters is if you let it control you. I know times are super hard, and you’re under a lot of stress, but you have to push through. Don’t let your hard work recovering go to waste."
