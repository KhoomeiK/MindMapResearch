I know it's a pretty radical way to think but it's a lot like what you're saying, it stops me from socializing and properly getting along with others. That's why I love reddit honestly because you can find so much people like yourself on subs like these but at the same time when you're behind this screen, no one knows who you really are, they don't know that you could be suffering from social anxiety problems, they just speak to you like you're a ""normal"" (there is no such thing as normal so I'm using that term loosely"".

As for the controller, you'll have to run it wired into your laptop unless the machine has bluetooth(if it does you have to plug the controller into the system, click the sync button on the controller and then simply connect to it in the bluetooth menu of your machine). If you play on steam I would also highly recommend using big picture mode as it will integrate the controller quite nicely and will show you the games you own that have controller support."
