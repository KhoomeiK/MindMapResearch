antidepressants,fkk1p5f,t3_fiwrah,1584269791.0,"I did something similar where I was on Prozac and switched to Luvox because I thought it would work better for me. Prozac I could feel working, it's stimulating like you said and for me it keeps me out of my head which helps with intrusive thoughts. I know SSRI's are long term drugs but the Prozac felt immediately helpful, Luvox didn't do anything. I went back to the Prozac and since then I've felt a lot better and have seen legitimate progress. I'm the kind of person that emotional numbing is a plus though, I suffer from psychotic depression.

If you don't mind being a little extra hungry at night I'd recommend Mirtazapine (Remeron) along with the Prozac (take both concurrently)  instead of Luvox at night, it blocks the side effects of the SSRIs and generally makes them more effective. Like I cannot recommend it enough, it was life changing for me when I found out about this medication. It also helps you fall asleep because it's a histamine receptor antagonist. It will make you more hungry though, like I mentioned, and can cause weight gain if you act on the hunger and eat more food. It doesn't cause any metabolic changes like other medications sometimes do.

Are you irritable normally? I forgot to mention that you cannot drink coffee or anything on Luvox or it will ruin your sleep because it makes it last 10x longer due to a reduction in its metabolism. If you're drinking coffee that could be why you're seeing irritability."

I do that then I will also think things about the opposite sex, imagine them have sex w/ me, or same sex if my unconscious mind thinks it can embarrass me by doing that.

I have trouble with walking around people that are coming towards me in the opposite direction, I tend to walk in the path of other people, and I will involuntarily smile when I do this (I smile when I am uncomfortable) and I think it makes people think I'm doing it on purpose.

I agree with you that none of them are real, which is a relief. My only thing is that I have to be making a facial expression when I react to my intrusive thoughts.

I'll tell you of my experience with one of his books, VALIS, which is a semi-autobiographical account where this same thing happens to the main character. Some of his friends reminded me of mine, one of them goes absolutely insane off of LSD and commits suicide, which had happened to a friend of mine who was very similar to his friend, only thankfully my friend ended up in the psych ward and recovered, so immediately I related to his story. At one point in the story the author is hit in the eye with a pink laser beam that unfolds information inside his mind that his son has a specific medical disorder that will kill him if he isn't taken to the doctor (which turned out to be the case). One of the explanations that he arrives at is that it's some kind of satellite put in orbit by aliens.

I'm going to spoil the story so if you want to read it, you'd better stop here. In VALIS the characters in the story go to see a movie where a pink laser beam is shot from a satellite that's the exact same color as the one that shot at him.

Currently, I'm writing a short story about a research facility where the faculty had linked their unconscious minds together to form an organic [distributed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing). Their mind's combined processing power form a super intelligence where any node (person) in the network (faculty) can harness the full potential of the group as a whole for use with their research. The hyper advanced facility creates almost magical technology. That's the super serious premise that I try to contrast with the more silly main storyline.

Despite the wishes of some of the other faculty members, the protagonist finds individuals in a neighboring city where her influence on them causes a sort of butterfly effect that the she uses to change the trajectory of international politics with the goal of creating permanent stability and world peace. The main character uses an invisibility cloak to follow around her targets and plants things in their environment, like changing pictures of models in the fashion department of the supermarket they're at to all look exactly like them and all the clothing they're wearing has 6.66 as the last three digits on the price tag in order to make them wear something different."

This reply is super late. The concept of the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times, is what I was referring to. How would a 'spirit of the times' work? Would it be an aggregation and summarization of the collective spirits of all living men in an era? 

Or could it be that a small number of people have a largely disproportionate influence on the rest of society and that any sort of collective spirit that exists in an era exists primarily within the opinion leaders? A member of a hive mind is generally thought to lack free will and not have capacity to function on their own. Is this how a spirit of the times works? I don't like to imagine that is the case, I admit I only don't want to because of personal preference, it doesn't seem to fit to me. I imagine that the group mind entity doesn't take away from its members but builds on top of them. It exists in addition to what is already present rather than takes its place.

Back to the spirit of the times. In the context of Mason Dixon, imagine a small town where only one person has a bulk of the original ideas and everyone else exists within a gradient of similarity. This idea becomes more complex when we imagine the strange social connections that exist as a result of social networking sites, but the fundamental premise I think still holds, with the exception of there being a set of highly influential cliques that function as the spirit of the times and everyone else exists on a gradient of similarity to one or more of them."

ThomasPynchon,eyr6oqg,t3_cy8zcf,1567361773.0,"I just finished Theodore Sturgeon's *More Than Human.* I enjoyed it, I have been looking to see how different authors write about this specific concept that wikipedia calls group mind ([here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)), a list I found of books where the concept is present in some form). In Mason Dixon it's brought up when they are on St. Helena when they're talking about a single person being the consciousness of a community / crowds being living things. I draw parallels between this idea and how cities are referred to as a single person in the Bible and the works of William Blake.

I'm trying to integrate the idea into something like digital tribalism / online echo chambers, where the premise is that the more segregated these tribes are, the more homogenous they can become overtime. I have never had an interest in philosophy and still kinda don't but it seems that a similar concept is central to the work of Hegel so I've started to take an interest in that. I think how modern recommender systems work, specifically [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering#Overview) can in some cases reduce individuality of members within similar communities.

I view Pynchon as a continuation of PKD since his work seems to build upon it. ""Inherent Vice"" I viewed partly as a parody of ""A Scanner Darkly"": (the dentists benefiting from opiate addiction vs. the rehab people benefiting from substance-D). There are parts in ""Mason & Dixon"" which talk about cities being living entities and people representing the collective consciousness of cities, that is one possible narrative you see discussed both there and of course in the Bible. Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, is an excellent example of the ""Collective Consciousness"" narrative.

I could write an enormous essay on psychotic narratives and their presence in Sci-Fi Literature. For example you see the stuff pop up to a lesser degree in the work of Asimov, however Asimov seems far less emotional in his thinking and therefore dismisses the psychotic elements as not being factual and defuses them. Like in the ""Prelude to the Foundation"" where the MC is being chased around on the dome of the planet that invoked paranoid themes but defuses them with, imo, annoying levels of rationality and logic. If you want to have a bigger discussion on this sort of topic, or dissociatives which I also am familiar with, definitely PM me.
