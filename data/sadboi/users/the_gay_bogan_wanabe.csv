It really depends a lot on what you do.
Kissing a guy is very similar to kissing a girl. If he is clean shaved it's pretty much identical. The difference is in how i feel about being with a guy.

I am into guys, so i really enjoy seeing or feeling that another guys is hard. 

Mutual masterbation is kinda cool. Uncut guys will have a preference for how you use his forskin. Cut guys typical use lube.

Sucking a guy is pretty intimate. Cock it's self is pretty tasteless, but precum & cum do have a taste. Letting a guy cum in your mouth is pretty intense the 1st time. But many guys like it.

I don't fuck in the ass much. But that takes some practice. Letting guys in there is difficult 1st time. Maybe start with a finger. 

At the end of the day i like the masculine energy. I like guys smells, their facial expression when they're turned on, & the grunting guys make.

Give it a go if you want. But stay safe. & only do what you're happy to do!
Be with a guy yr comfortable to be with. & horny to be with!   : )
He dont have to say I love you, but he should treat you with care & respect! & vice versa! 

Stay safe & ATB!  : )"
