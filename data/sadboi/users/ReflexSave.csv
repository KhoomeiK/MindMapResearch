depression,fnem8ld,t3_g13d2r,1586891877.0,"I'm so sorry, brother.
I'm going through this too. 
It was one week ago today. And it feels like I will never find the will to live ever again... I had saved her from her first attempt. Then 2 weeks later, out of the blue, I wake up to the news. We had just talked the night before, and everything was ""okay"".
The crippling guilt I have to live with is unbearable. This isn't a reality I want to live in. It's like I'm stuck in the wrong universe. 

Something I try to remember is... While I could not save her a second time, she told me many times that she was the happiest she had ever been in life, with me. That she had never been so loved. And if nothing else, perhaps I made her last moments in life a little more bearable, even if her demons won out in the end.

And I'm sure that's the case for you. You can't always save a person. But you can love them and help them find peace.

I know what you're going through and my heart goes out to you. Please, dm me if you would like to talk. Perhaps talking to someone who is in the exact same boat will help."

It's never too late to go back to school, but it does get harder and harder the older you get. And it's an opportunity to make new friends and new experiences, and that's something that should never be undervalued. When you stop having excitement and novel experiences, that's when you start dying..

I don't have a lot of personal experience as it pertains to transgender struggles, and I worry I might say something unhelpful out of ignorance. I do think that everybody goes through difficulties in figuring out who they are, transgendered or not. Of course, due to stigmas and social friction, some will have a tougher go at it than others. Just remember that you're not alone. And while I sympathize with the increased difficulty level of that particular mission, I also think it's really cool in a way. Getting to see the world from a perspective that the majority of people do not. I'm rooting for you, my dude/dudette! I'm proud of you. Hit me up whenever you'd like!

AskReddit,f4jowyt,t1_f4jjbbs,1571623524.0,"Hey man. I'm really sorry for what you've gone through, and what you continue to go through. You seem like a very strong person who's been dealt some shitty cards. I'm sure that ex friend of yours didn't know the real effect those kind of words can have on a person, and I highly doubt he would have said them if he did. It sounds like he has some struggles to work out on his own.

My only personal exposure to Borderline Personality is 1 ex roommate some years ago, and 1 recent ex girlfriend. The ex roommate threatened to murder me in my sleep. The ex girlfriend, after being awesome for 5 months, became abusive and vindictive and life destroying to a truly comedic level. You really wouldn't believe me if I elaborated. She was very unwell.. My point is, I try not to let these experiences bias me against people who are dealing with similar things, and if you are feeling ashamed for your diagnosis, look at these kind of people. I would reckon you don't sink to her level. There are shades of any tone, and you're more than just a diagnosis. It's not your fault, and it's not your definition.

You say that you have no support, and my heart goes out to you for that. If you need a buddy to talk to, dm me and I'll get you my discord. I'm also in a discord server that you might enjoy. Very supportive and positive, but not a pity party or too.. what's the word... Gushy? You get the idea.

Here's an idea: Maybe we're not so much people in search of spiritual experiences, but rather we're spirits having unfortunate *human* experiences, and being cut off from what we truly are, are left feeling cold and abandoned..

I don't know. But hey. I'm so sorry you're going through this. And I know I can't literally be there to hug you, but I know pain. And I'm a pretty good listener.

Needless to say, the poor girl had a lot of personal issues to resolve. So from this side of the fence, I know how disruptive that can be, and I sympathize with you. CBT, or cognitive behavioral therapy, is said to be more effective for patients with BPD that traditional therapy, so that might be something to look into. 

That was my only firsthand experience with BPD in particular, so all I would have to offer is my own observations as to how her disorder affected her behavior. I wish you luck and better times ahead, friend."

Secondly, you are NOT worthless. I know you feel that way, and I'm really really sorry that you do. But that doesn't make it true. 

Thirdly, those people who ""barely remember"" you exist probably hold you in higher esteem than you realize. They, fortunately, don't know what it's like to live with this, so they don't know the things to say or do to get past the ""depression filter"" so that the way you interpret their thoughts matches reality.
Fourthly... You are the second human I've talked to all day. I slept for 16 hours, and stared at the wall for 2 more after that. Idk if you'll read this, idk if you'll care.
