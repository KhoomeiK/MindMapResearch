depression,fmwtz1b,t3_fxubdd,1586452995.0,"I was in a similar situation. In my experience, I tend to (subconsciously) seek out people who are similarly broken to myself in an attempt to heal myself. One reason I stopped letting new people in when I’m struggling, because it always ended up making things worse. It might be time to re-evaluate the situation and ask yourself “is this what I want?” And maybe you don’t know what you want, and that’s fine too. But put yourself first. If this person isn’t helping you heal yourself, then they’re likely part of the problem. You are worth more than that. 

It sounds like a straight toxic situation. Neither of you is necessarily to blame, but you two are bringing out the worst in each other. Just ended my relationship that turned into this four months ago. We always assumed the other person had negative intentions and would defend ourselves to the death. 

It also sounds like the two of you have become codependent. You are not responsible for his emotions or his actions. HE is. And he is not responsible for YOUR emotions or actions. YOU are. Own your own shit, but not his."

Technically he cannot tell me no, but the lease as it is written out now says no pets without written consent, so he has to give me written consent. But he is dragging everything out and I don’t have the emotional energy to fight it. And I think he knows that. So he wins by way of not having a mental illness."
depression,fmwotzi,t3_fxufc5,1586450397.0,"Coming here and telling us that is one of the hardest and bravest things you could do, and you did it. Maybe whenever you feel like you want to try again, you come back here?"
depression,fmwmui2,t3_fxuhas,1586449402.0,"I’m in a similar boat. I really needed this “down time” but I’m anxious about what everything is going to look like when it’s over. We gotta hang in there. For now, I’m pretending this is permanent so my anxiety can’t hijack my day. Probably not the healthiest, but it’s working for now. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
depression,fmgwtmi,t3_fh565g,1586059979.0,Me too. Honestly it’s kind of a relief to tell the truth and not try to pretend I’m fine.
