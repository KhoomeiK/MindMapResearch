PhysicsStudents,fotz8qb,t1_foti3gs,1588071370.0,"Im a junior mechanical engineering student, Formulas are usually either given to you or you bring your own on a cheat card for physic exams. 

Honestly my biggest advice to you is to learn these concepts rather than memorize the problem solving steps.  The more of an effort you make to understand the concepts and theories the less you feel the need of cheat card because you can derive most of those equations on your own. 

For example, in dynamics, displacement then velocity then acceleration some calculus you can derive formulas like projectile motion and so on...

Ive seen students with all the formulas on a cheat card fail exams. 

In short, learn and get strong with your calculus specially that first Cal I class, learn the fundamentals not just problem solving and don’t be shy in asking questions (stupid or not) students often act like they know but don’t, drives professors insane. May i ask why physics?"
PhysicsStudents,fotxugq,t1_fos5gkb,1588069983.0,"A unit of Force is 1N or 1 “Newton”, remember it like this, newton is known for? Laws of motions 1st law, F=ma. Unit of Force equals to some mass (kg, lbs,..etc) times acceleration m/s^2 then combined units are
(kg)m/s^2

Same for work...
 Unit of work equals to Unit of force times distance, Joules. Force times some distance is (kg) m^2 /s^2 (m) Just multiplied distance to force to get 1 joule. 

Practice 1 or 2 conversions,  as long as the units are on the right “top or bottom” of the fraction you can convert back an fourth."
