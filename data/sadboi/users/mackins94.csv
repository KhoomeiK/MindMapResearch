AskUK,f3p0w9a,t3_dhfp2g,1571037262.0,"I'm 25, and just recently hit my first 18k job. My 'sector' is customer service and admin. I went through 5 years of waitressing, retail, cleaning and care jobs to get where I am. I'm not happy with my salary by far, but it gets the bills paid and I've got little spending money for myself- though I do have ¬£250 credit card (that gets paid off every month) and I have also got 1k over draft that I'm in a vicious cycle with. 

I am vigorously looking for higher paid jobs, I've got an interview at a very known insurance company, that will be working on the phones, which I'm okay with doing..if I get the pay, which will be 20k. 

My best friend on the other hand, took an apprenticeship at 18 at a financial law firm and is now on 21k at the same age as me. She's had it quite easy, in the respect of her company paying for her qualifications. But on the other hand, shes doing 4 peoples jobs for that salary and is financial manager- with that streak of luck, as I like to call it, she can get a job anywhere. 

My partner, has hit 28k at the age of 21. Hes a welder fabricator, but has relocated to the netherlands due to the want of a better life, and money. He's got all his qualifications, but that hasn't made his life easy at all. I have worked in metal manufacturing, and met men who have rocked up to a warehouse, said that they'd try their hand at anything and gone from minimum wage (8.50) to a welder within 2 years and hitting 2k a month take home. 

My mother (56) is a fully qualified carpenter with nearly 45 years experience, and she has hit 23k a month within the last 5 years due to company pay rises. 

My point here is, it doesn't matter of your qualifications, but your work ethic, as in 'I'll do what makes me happy, but if it doesn't, then I'll move on'. 

You've got to realise your worth and go for it, be prepared for let downs, stress, moments of self doubt and fight through everything. Because if you dont do that, you're going to get yourself in a rut, and be no use to anyone, even yourself. 

Confidence is the key word. Get something you're interested in...theres so many fields out there. 

Good luck."
