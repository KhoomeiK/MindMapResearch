A fair compromise would be a multi-payer system that doesn’t eliminate private health insurance but enrolls anyone not on private health insurance onto a public plan. Some European countries do this, where everyone is on a public plan but those paying for private health insurance get money back. 

Biden doesn’t even support universal coverage. He supports expanding a public option that you can *buy into* which we have no idea if it will be affordable or if it will cover enough stuff. Studies suggest it will leave up to 15 million Americans uncovered.

I’m so bummed about this election. This pandemic underscores the need to either have full Medicare for All OR a hybrid system where people have a real choice. Every democratic primary candidate except Biden and Klobuchar supported a type of universal healthcare. I understand the stakes are high and that Biden is better than Trump, but this it is CLEAR the American electorate is ready for expanding healthcare to all.
