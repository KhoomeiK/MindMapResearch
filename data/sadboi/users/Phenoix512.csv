1st entry

It started out as an accident we think in April but once the ants had created technology and the ability to understand human words they quickly advanced. From one ant hill to control of the whole street by day 2. By the end of the week they had conquered all the ant hills in the county.


2nd entry

Mostly we didn't notice 2020 had already overfilled Humanities plate. It wasn't until the end of May that people talked about seeing more spiders and insect's showing up in their homes. Fake news we thought. What we didn't know was these were refugees fleeing towards the only thing that might stop the ants march.


3rd entry

In June the ants made their presence known by attacking a park in Washington state. They swooped down on the park goers riding giant hornet's with small hornet's acting as smaller but faster fighters. While ants on the ground blitzkrieged with armored vehicles made from steel and firing bullet ants to swarm their targets. They even deployed bombardier beetles as artillery. The park was quickly overran and many people laid dead.


4th entry

The talking head's and local government debated what caused ants to swarm. Some people suggested it was an act of war but are laughed off the air.


5th entry

It is July 5th and yesterday ants organized the most devastating attack. Using Termites and various other enslaved bugs they have damaged the power grid even causing power plants to overload by destroying the safety precautions.

The government announced it would launch project Orkin.


6th entry

The launching of chemical weapons were suppose to be the solution 
But the ants were ready hiding in hard to reach places while brave ants brought down even the most elite warriors Orkin had trained.

7th entry

 The world is in chaos ant forces using hit and run tactics have crippled most of the world making social distancing near impossible and collapsing hospitals with the influx of victims. 


8th entry

When it looked like the ants might actually collapse Human civilization light shone on Humanity. That light came in the form of lizards, frogs, anteaters, spiders using their own natural abilities they feasted on the ant armies.


9th entry 

Humanity has finally begun to recover and rebuild as we ring in the new year and the clock strikes making it officially 2021 


10th entry

Across the globe a horn loud enough to rattle windows is heard and a monotone voice speaks ""Let the second test begin"" another horn blast rattle's my window. In the distance a thunderous drum like noise coming louder with each tick of the clock."

AskReddit,fpx9w9l,t3_gfsi0q,1588978493.0,"I was 9 year's old I was sleeping on the couch because my bed had springs poking out.

I woke up to see a ghostly lady playing solitaire at the kitchen table. She looks up at me and beckons to me calling me by my nick name.
