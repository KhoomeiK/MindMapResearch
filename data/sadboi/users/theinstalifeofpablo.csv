AMA,fpae93t,t1_fpad3l8,1588446349.0,"Thank you. I'm fortunate to have loving and supporting family and a few close friends. 

Thank you for your support. It's a bit strange to be diagnosed with a mental illness that dates back to my childhood (in my 30s now), but at least I now know that there's a reason behind the dark thoughts and self-hatred. I'll get there."
AMA,fpabbst,t1_fpaanci,1588444616.0,"From what we've discussed in the past 10 weeks, we cannot find a root cause...(yet). I'm scheduled to begin schema-therapy and DMT - hopefully we'll get to the bottom of it. The team believe that I have had BPD for a long time, childhood incidents or triggers seem to always be what causes the ""traits"" or ""schemas"" that build your personality. If not, I'm hoping to get enough tools out of therapy so I can live a more normal life. Regulate emotions, think more logically than pessimistic and better myself, so much so that I can like myself."

BPD,fp1c97o,t3_gaoaxf,1588230773.0,"Thank you. I read a post last night about""other"" symptoms of BPD, approx 850 upvotes. I disagreed with other post. There are 9 symptoms of BPD, if you have 5 minimum, you can be diagnosed. The amount of ""symptoms"" that this certain post said is not excuses to act like that. The OP in that post has other personality ""traits"" or ""schemas"" that I would recommend they seek help with. As they act like that and have been diagnosed with BPD, they seem to make the excuse that it's ok, which does not help other redditors. BPD diagnosed may find it hard to fit in... Reading that post makes me wonder if people will start acting in those menacing ways mentioned in said post, to fit further in with the BPD crew here online. Please read with care folks and don't start associating with these personality traits because the internet told you."
BPD,fp0xmtv,t3_gadzsv,1588219245.0,"I think OP has hit some of them on the head. But I can't agree with these all being symptoms of BPD. While some of them are, a lot of them are just schemas / personality traits of the OP in particular, even though some others can relate. 

BPD has the 9 symptoms we know of. There are plenty of other things/schemas that make up our personality. Paranoia, anxious-avoidant, obsessive etc. If 5/9 symptoms are present through SQIDS, BPD would be diagnosed. But BPD isn't who you are, you have BPD. Plenty of other ""traits"" will make up your personality."
