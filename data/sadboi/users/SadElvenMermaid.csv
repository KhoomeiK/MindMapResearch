not to say all self diagnosers are like me but that's my measly self justification.

i struggle with dichotomous thinking so much among so much else but i also know trying to get diagnosed with a specific thing is so wrong, so yeah, i get it

its not that i want bpd, its that i want to find something that resonates with my experiences.  im also trans, and its the same sort of struggle.  how can i say, hey all of this resonates with me deeply, but its not me.  i know this isn't some club and its not about being included or excluded, but the feeling is what it is.  if it isn't this, and if it isnt just avpd, then what is it. what is wrong with me.  why am i how i am and how do i get help if i dont have a way to identify it.  maybe all the categorization is harmful in a way, sometimes.  sometimes.   maybe symptoms are one thing, and disorder categorization is overused.  who knows.  we're all human, including the people making the disorder categorzations and doing the diagnosing.  i know its based on observational science and brain imaging and such, but still.  


craziest thing just happened that i went to the avpd wiki page, scrolled to a section, and found this "" 

Earlier theorists proposed a personality disorder with a combination of features from [borderline personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) and avoidant personality disorder, called ""avoidant-borderline mixed personality"" (AvPD/BPD).[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder#cite_note-15) ""   so maybe that's what i am.  a disorder that doesn't officially exist.  fitting since being trans is like being less than real.  not saying you're saying that about my self diagnosing, just saying its how i feel."

**best cheap 88 key midi keyboard that can play lots of notes at the same time?**

i was using an old one till my brother started using it, but it could only play like 5 or so notes simultaneously. and while using a computer keyboard already isn't great (since afaik i can't remap the keys in FL studio and it would take time to memorize since seemingly random keys perhaps saved for keyboard shortcuts dont make notes while the others do) my keyboard also can't have many keys pressed simultaenously

i was looking at nice scale-weighted keyboards but then i realized i dont need any of the synth sounds built into the keyboard like most of those have (and idk how to or even IF i could transfer those sounds directly into FL studio or if i'd have to record them from a speaker) since i can use VSTs instead

i guess my ideal would be a weighted key keyboard that is literally JUST a midi keyboard with no bells and whistles. well, maybe that scroll thing that modulates the sound.

well actually, is it possible to map digital VSTs to a physical controller? it seems there are things like that but on the expensive end [http://forum.cakewalk.com/Best-MIDI-controller-for-VST-parameters-m3195397.aspx](http://forum.cakewalk.com/Best-MIDI-controller-for-VST-parameters-m3195397.aspx)

so it is not so much tme saying being peaceful is crazy, its also them saying ""you're not normal, and that is weid"".   before a judgement about whether it is violence or not is made, a judgement about the norm being wrong is made, and people will vehemently defend a group they are a part of out of insecurity.   in groups and out groups psychologically.  that's my take on it, based on what i perceive and feel.

back when i was a kid, i couldn't understand the fun of FPS games.  I still dont really enjoy the killing aspect, but i play them now because i enjoy the tactics and stuff of them, and because i know people that play them so its something to do.   but im quite effectively numbed to the killing--even tho yes, im fully aware that this killing is taking place in a video game and not in real life, the feeling of killing was once there for me when first introduced to videogames, and then it faded out of my awareness after just pure exposure to it.   i think that's the same sort of thing that has happened in the world.   you're exposed to the killing nonstop by way of food on the table and in the store, and you either never really learn about it (i never did until researching it), or it fades from memory.   in a way it sortof becomes a stupid ""fact"" of life, that because so many are doing it, its best to just put up and shut up.  its not, but it feels that way.

if you have full empathy for everything in the world, its hard to do anything.   all the insane rationalizations.  oh that homeless person is probably dangerous, probably an addict, someone should help them, but i am going to keep my distance.

they say that hate isn't the opposite of love, but apathy is, and i think that's effectively true.   everybody just wants to live in a bubble of un-reality where they BELIEVE they are caring, and they really are, but only to the things in their immediate environment, or to the people they care about in that environment.    psychology on facebook friends suggested we can only have at maximum 130 real friends in our lives, after that we just can't dole out the time/care/whatever the parameters were for that judgement, i dont actually know, i just remember the 130 number.   but that doesn't mean we can't change our actions towards those we dont have time for, of course."

DanceDanceRevolution,fq2dkmq,t3_ggltsw,1589055118.0,"fantastic review!  i haven't modded my l-tek but someone a while back suggested adding threaded inserts for the screws if you're taking it apart a good bit

""One thing that would be a huge improvement is switching construction over to threaded inserts and machine screws. Over time the wood screws will destroy the MDF.""  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DanceDanceRevolution/comments/7zj4ef/a\_little\_look\_atinside\_the\_ltek\_polish\_dance\_pads/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DanceDanceRevolution/comments/7zj4ef/a_little_look_atinside_the_ltek_polish_dance_pads/)

im too afraid to try it myself but if you wanna be the test pilot here's a video about inserts that i think explains it well with tips and tricks (tho he's talking about regular wood not MDF) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvcNG6bQcRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvcNG6bQcRE)

also, i feel sad because the website for l-tek doesn't have any reviews on it yet, so i think we all with l-tek pads should add reviews to their website to do it up proper"

Anticonsumption,fplcfg2,t3_gds1ba,1588710224.0,"whole foods isn't so bad, and i work at starbucks (yes they're wasteful like every big industry is, but they're also the only company in the fucking WORLD that offers inclusive transgender healthcare benefits, which is what i am, so i dont have much of a choice, plus they offer a college program)

here's a good video on coffee cups from a coffee pro [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFXznoNqRfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFXznoNqRfo)

the insanity of starbucks is that the plastic cold (iced) cups ARE recyclable, but once they slap a sticker label on them, they no longer are---altho...my store recently switched to stickers that peel off easier, so maybe they can be recycled, tho most people still dont, they dont follow the guides in store for recycling vs trash, and even when they do, we end up throwing the recycling in the trash because the recycling company gets mad at us because it isn't good enough to be recycled perfectly properly.   basically the only thing that gets recycled is cardboard--but that's still better than AMC theatres, which literally trashes everything in a compactor each night, tho sometimes they give away the popcorn to homeless shelters, as does starbucks with leftover food.    so recycling, or choosing to throw the cup in the recycling bin at the store, like a brand name, becomes just an image, a thing to feel good about while being effectively a lie."

its not vegan but i bought shoes at a thrift store since i felt i wasn't directly supporting the animal murder industry that way (altho working for a company that literally goes through more milk than coffee beans is kinda not vegan either, i need their benefits since no other company offers decent transgender health benefits), though it still doesn't sit well with me since someone else could've bought those shoes instead of me.
