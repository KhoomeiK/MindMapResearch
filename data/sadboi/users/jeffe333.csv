audiophile,fr43q33,t1_fr3lcd2,1589874764.0,"The same year that Getz/Gilberto came out (1964), Stan Getz released another album featuring Astrud Gilberto called Getz Au Go Go.  I also really liked her first solo album, The Astrud Gilberto Album (1965), as well as Look to the Rainbow (1966).

If you like the samba sound, which is my preference, I highly recommend  Vinicius de Moraes.  He did a fair amount of work w/ Jobim, too, and they both served as pioneers of the samba sound.   João Gilberto, as you know from Getz/Gilberto, is great.  Gilberto Gil's early stuff is good bossa nova.  Elis Regina and Ivan Lins are two of my favorites.  Luiz Bonfá made some great music, especially his collaboration w/ Jobim on the composition for the film *Black Orpheus* (1959).  

Bebel Gilberto is the daughter of João Gilberto, and she's made some really melodious bossa nova sounds over the years.  There's also Oscar Castro-Neves, Sérgio Mendes, and Gal Costa.

I also like tropicália, as it mixes various Brazilian sounds.  Gilberto Gil played a fair amount of this, and Caetano Veloso was probably its most well-known artist.  My favorite artist in this genre is probably the Brazilian Tropical Orchestra, who leans heavily toward samba and bossa nova."

rapecounseling,fqkei0x,t1_fqjzsnn,1589425603.0,"I've spoken to mods in various subs about this, and it appears that it's part of the Reddit algorithm to downvote certain posts in certain subs at certain times.  The reasoning is to even out the flow of content voting, b/c far and away, data shows that the first comments in on a post, more often than not, get the most upvotes.  It's just their way of evening out the process.

Edit:  What are you downvoting this for?  It's a fact.  This isn't my opinion.  This is how Reddit operates.  You asked a question, and it was answered.  If you don't like it, take it up w/ Reddit."

I'd really like to get a rack server case to house this in.  Are you running this in a tower?  Also, [am I reading this wrong](https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=X470D4U2-2T#Specifications), b/c I'm only seeing support for 64GB of memory.  Or, is that per dimm slot?"

How much stuff do you run on this rig?  

How many VMs could you comfortably run?

What do you estimate your monthly electricity bill looks like from this device alone?"

You can ask if there are any particular technologies you should read up; that's probably the easiest way.  Alternatively, you can reach out directly to HR, and ask them if they'd like you to fill out any paperwork before your scheduled start date."

CEO: ""We're looking for suggestions for a company name.  We've come up w/ a few that we don't really like.  Decasys, Switchsys, Netsys, Routsys...""

CFO: ""Anyone have any ideas?""

Guy from the Back of the Room: ""Enterasys!""

CEO: Hey, I like that!  It's snappy!""

CFO: ""I think we have a winner.""

Cubicle-Mate of Guy at the Back of the Room: ""Where'd you come up w/ that idea?""

Guy at the Back of the Room: ""I thought to myself, ""What's a good name for a company that won't be in business in 10 years?""  And, Enterasys popped into my head."""
