>Also what’s the point of talking to  therapists and doctors when you can’t be honest? As soon as you express  that you would like to die they lock you up and set you back even  further in life. 

This is the question I've asked myself a thousand times but I still haven't produced a satisfactory answer to it. On some days I find it helpful to talk to a therapist when I'm *not* suicidal because I can be honest about what I'm feeling. On some days that I am suicidal and have to lie about it, I still find it helpful to be able to tell somebody about part of my struggle. But a good deal of the time I find therapy to be less-than-helpful because I don't have the energy to lie about being okay. That's why I switched from weekly to every-other-week to monthly sessions of therapy. I don't recommend that anybody do or don't do what I do or don't do because I am me and you are you, what works for me may or may or may not work for you. That is a choice for you and it is not my place to make it. It might be helpful to hear somebody else's thoughts, that's my reason for sharing.

>So my original question is how come humans try to stop  others from committing suicide when they don’t know what’s really best  for the individual?

I have two answers to this question, one more optimistic and two more pessimistic. My first and relatively optimistic answer to the question is that people mean well and truly do want to help but they're misguided. They have oversimplified world-views and believe that no rational person would wish to die and therefore the suicidal subject is unaware of what they're doing and cannot reasonably make the choice to end their own life. While people may mean well, they are ultimately misguided and project their life-at-all-costs world-view onto other people without realizing the fallacy of projecting their interests onto others.

My second explanation for people trying to prevent others from suicide is more pessimistic and misanthropic. Perhaps, I reckon, that, people have more selfish and less-than-altruistic for preventing others from committing suicide. Sometimes I feel as if the real reason people try to prevent others from committing suicide is that they have their own self-interests at heart: they want to avoid the pain incurred when losing somebody they care about (or don't). They would feel bad if somebody they care about or even somebody that they don't know committed suicide. They would feel sad to know that somebody died, especially by ending their own lives.

Alternatively to my two explanations for people trying to prevent others from committing suicide is the notion that people suffer from oversimplified world-views and believe that death and suicide are always ""bad"" for reasons of religion, emotions, or mis-applied logic.

>They would never know what it’s been like for the suicidal person  throughout every step of their life and what the future holds for them  if any.

This is often but not always the case, from my personal experience. A surprising or perhaps less-than-surprising amount of people who try to prevent others from committing suicide are or were themselves suicidal. This is often in accordance with my earlier explanations of the general population's reasons for preventing others from committing suicide. I believe that another reason that suicidal or formerly-suicidal persons try to prevent others from committing suicide is reductionist logic along the lines of *if I did or am dealing with it, then so can you* or *as somebody who is or was suicidal, I know better than you, you shouldn't commit suicide*. Furthermore, suicidal or formerly-suicidal persons often wrongly project the facts of their experiences to those of other people. A final explanation for this is that suicidal persons may hold some of the same beliefs as the non-suicidal persons who try to prevent others from committing suicide, but believe themselves to be the exception.

>I believe if someone truly wants to die they should have the right and  freedom to. Not be locked up in a mental hospital and or forced to  confine in everyday life.. on and on every single day is torture and  depression from the moment the eyes open till close.

While I would rather fewer people commit suicide, especially those whom I care about, it is not my choice nor any of my business and I find myself in agreement with this statement. I believe that I know best in respect to my life or lack thereof and there is no compelling reason why that is true in my case but not in others. I cannot reconcile my belief in self-determination with the mainstream attitude of paternalism.

>The suicidal thoughts never ever leave.

Results vary wildly from person to person. They may be perpetual for one patient but a thing of the past for the next. This is nigh impossible to predict and very complicated. Furthermore, one patient may find life is still living even with suicidal thoughts but the next patient may arrive at a different conclusion. The truth and relevance of this statement vary from one patient to the next and is more complicated than I can comprehend. The truth, relevance, and implications of this statement are for the individual patient to decide for themselves, with or without the helps of others, depending on their discretion. I may offer my input but I am not in a position to try to make this decisions for others, and I don't think anybody can make this decision for anybody else.

>So why are you so certain not committing suicide is for the best?

I am not and cannot be. I will gladly offer my input and try to sway somebody away from suicide but it is not my decision to make. I do not know best what is in another person's best interests. I must allow them to make the choice for themselves, regardless of my preference that they not commit suicide."

*There are two men, both rushed into the emergency department of the local hospital. In two similar accidents one had his finger chopped off and the other had his arm chopped off from the elbow down. Both of them lost a valuable appendage. Is the first man's pain invalid because of the second man's intuitively greater pain? No. Even if the second man suffers more, that has no bearing on the first man. Not only that but the circumstances of their accidents and lives make all the difference. Perhaps the man losing an arm loses his nondominant arm and the man losing a finger loses his ability to make a living because he was a baseball pitcher. Even more simply, the loss of an appendage might cripple one of the men physically and emotionally but leave the other one relatively unharmed because of the complicating factors. No person can decide whose suffering is better or worse. Everybody experiences life differently.*

The only reason I don't have an OCD diagnosis is because I already have a PTSD diagnosis and an additional diagnosis wouldn't help with my treatment. That was a tangent but what I'm trying to say is I empathize. I was the weird girl without friends. I was the weird girl who couldn't get a girlfriend. I'm not sharing that to be uplifting or to say ""if I can do it you can too"". I'm sharing that to show that you're not alone here, we are here to talk if you want to. I don't understand your situation and one can never fully understand somebody else's situation, but I'm happy to try to understand your situation.

I'm not saying that hatred for an entire class of people is okay, it's not. I used to hate all men and that wasn't okay. But just because you hold or express unpleasant beliefs doesn't make you less valuable as a person. To me as a human, your status or identity as an In'Cel is relevant only in trying to understand what you're going through. You are no less valuable. You are no less worthy of love. You are no less valid as a human being. No, no particular person owes you anything but you as a human being still deserve to be understood and receive care and compassion. If you want to talk to somebody, I'm here and happy to listen.

I didn't proof-read this response so if I said something offensive, I assure you it was in error. It is my sincerest hope that things get better for you."
SuicideWatch,ezf1jaz,t1_ezf12tt,1567871763.0,"What they said to you is not okay. They shouldn't be encouraging you to commit suicide like that or saying something so invalidating like ""nobody cares"". I encourage you to report them to both r/SuicdeWatch (assuming they use this Subreddit) and to Reddit administrators. Truthfully I doubt that there's nobody who would care if you died, it's easy to feel as if nobody cares but oftentimes somebody does—that's not really relevant here anyway, what's important is seeing if there's a way for you to feel better."

SuicideWatch,ezf0u35,t1_ezf0o7h,1567871418.0,"Would you like to talk about why you want to end your life, or would it help to talk about something unrelated? I'm happy to talk and listen about either."
SuicideWatch,ezf0o0z,t3_d0xc6q,1567871345.0,"As far as me personally I play videogames (Black Ops III, Factorio, CS:GO, Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress) and watch Netflix (Altered Carbon, My Little Pony, The Good Place, Star Trek: the Next Generation) and Youtube (Arthur Isaac, Kurzgesagt) and talk to my friends. I also find it helpful to draw, paint, and build things in videogames (sort of playing videogames but more specific)."
SuicideWatch,ezf0bt1,t3_d0xk6l,1567871202.0,What's on your mind? I'm on-and-off Reddit but I check it daily. It might take a bit for me to respond but I'm open to talk if you want to.
SuicideWatch,ezf07vk,t1_ezcscei,1567871154.0,I went to bed a little bit before you responded. What's on your mind?
SuicideWatch,ezc3cve,t1_ezc2om3,1567829254.0,I was at first but I gave up on it and then later it became automatic.
SuicideWatch,ezc2phf,t1_ezc0tg2,1567828983.0,Me? I'm never quite sure. The best I can do is make an educated guess. If I'm flying or something similar is happening I'm probably dreaming.
SuicideWatch,ezc2m61,t1_ezc02tf,1567828944.0,"First off, happy cake day. Secondly I'm really not sure. It happened for me naturally."
SuicideWatch,ezbzzdp,t1_ezbzu8i,1567827811.0,Well I guess that makes two of us then.
SuicideWatch,ezbzwmi,t1_ezbz4f4,1567827778.0,"My honest advice is to exercise caution as far as that goes. As a natural lucid dreamer it's lead to dream-reality confusion and all sorts of troubles. A blessing, true, but a curse as well. Please dream responsibly."
SuicideWatch,ezbwco7,t3_d0qlxg,1567826324.0,Want to talk? I'll be going to bed in maybe a half an hour but I check my Reddit daily and am happy to talk.
SuicideWatch,ezbvddf,t3_d0qpkh,1567825929.0,Wanna talk?
SuicideWatch,ezbu8x5,t1_ezbpi5s,1567825482.0,"Me too. I've been beaten, raped, stabbed, publicly slandered, immolated. Just last night I was put in a concentration camp and told that if I thought of a particular person I would be burned alive.

Dreams are more than dreams, it seems."
