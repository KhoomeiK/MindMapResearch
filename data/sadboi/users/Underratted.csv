Sometimes I find it's helpful to make lists so that when I get confused I have something to keep me on track. My heart hurts for you in this time though, it's so hard to try to keep up when you are going through something nobody else can see. It sounds like it would be really troublesome to have to redo this class, and since you've already put in all of the time you might as well at least show up and do your best. As the saying goes, you miss every shot that you don't take."

AnorexiaNervosa,fp0bmxp,t1_fnv2ou7,1588206156.0,"Hi sorry I missed responding! This is a tough question to answer because it was so many smaller things coming together. Basically, I went through a really tough breakup when I ended a bad relationship, and it caused me to reevaluate quite a few things in my life. I imagined what I wanted my future to look like, and I knew that it didn't include living at the mercy of anorexia. Then I took a trip alone backpacking for 6 months. During this time I promised myself that I would let my mind and body heal from everything that I had been through and ate as much and whatever my body craved. At first this was hard. I gained roughly 25 lbs once I started eating ""normally"". I put that in quotes because at first my body was so ravenous, I would eat thousands of calories of peanut out of the jar! The weight gain was hard to see and there aren't a lot of photos of me during this period because I felt a lot of conflicting emotions about it. Gradually over the past couple of years as my mental health had improved (thanks therapy and meds!) the weight came off as I learned to take care of myself lovingly and kindly. My body composition is completely different now and I look healthy again. One thing that definitely pushed me to get back on track was not being able to do things with people I love. I could barely walk to class, let alone go hiking or pretty much anything active since my muscles had practically dissolved. I was tired all of the time and I never truly enjoyed anything anymore. I know with any mental illness recovery is an uphill battle, but I think the most powerful piece of the puzzle is making a commitment to yourself to do your best and truly (really really really) mean it. It's not always going to be easy and sometimes it's two steps forward one step back. I still have intrusive thoughts and feelings surrounding food, but it's my choice whether I act on them or not. Now I love going to restaurants, cooking and sharing food with loved ones, and have a much healthier relationship with exercise. I wish for everyone struggling that they are able to get support that they need and recover from such a debilitating but often invisible struggle."

I guess I know that it's not really up to me right now as much as it's up to him to hear what I'm saying and make changes to his behavior. It's tough to get space as much as I want it right now because he also hasn't made any friends in the nearly two years that we've been living where we do currently. It's hard for me to get time alone and I barely have energy to socialize with my friends since he is relying on me for most  of his social needs. To a point, I almost feel as if part of my identity has been dissolved in the relationship due to lack of space and individual experiences. He doesn't actively seem upset when I go out with friends but he has in the past and it's hard not to feel guilty leaving him at home. I also wish that he would go out and do social things to let me have some space. We've talked about that one before but nothing has changed."

We both go to therapy on a semi weekly basis  (separately) so it's not as if he isn't trying to work on his own things too. I can feel myself reaching the end of my rope so to speak, as this past while it feels like I've been pouring all of my emotional energy into him and not getting anything back. Yesterday I told him that I didn't want to discuss something that was stressful at that time and he was still chapped about my asserting an emotional boundary this morning. I can see other issues too, in hindsight such as being excessively upset when I didn't want to do something that he was excited for, including sex. I know that he isn't trying to manipulate me through these excessive displays of dissappointment but also gets upset when I tell him that's how it can tend to feel.

There are some things that we now know to avoid (cuddling in a specific way etc.) But I know and communicate that it is not his fault and nothing to do with him. This wasn't your fault! 

You had no idea and did not trigger her on purpose. Personally I wouldn't cut out the person but everyone responds differently. It sounds like she's still struggling with this trauma though. Is she seeing a therapist about that? The best thing for me has been seeing a super good therapist and working through it. 

In terms of your personal relationship be careful to respect boundaries she sets as much as you possibly can. Trauma stemming from sexualized violence stems from lack of consent, so I've found myself sensitive to boundaries and consent in all areas of my life. Be sure to ask before you do anything you aren't sure about, and be extra mindful when you know she had been having a tough time. Sometimes certain things are okay and sometimes not. 

The best thing to do is ask, but don't pressure her to talk about her trauma. Be willing to listen but okay with just sitting there supportively too."
BPD,f0gkayu,t1_f0ggr5j,1568601110.0,You wouldn't tell an SO about having BPD??
BPD,f0garer,t3_d4tdwf,1568596428.0,This sounds so so hard. Is she seeing professionals to help her with this? If you are really afraid that she'll commit suicide and she is hurting herself so frequently is it possible that being an inpatient could be the best option right now? Idk much but this sounds so hard. My heart goes out to you.
femalehairadvice,f0g14oh,t3_d4exjr,1568592059.0,Maybe try changing your part? It seems like it would change the entire vibe if you parted you hair in the middle. Not sure how your bangs are cut but maybe a softer/shaggier bang? 100% support some good purple!
