Paranormal,f91el7a,t1_f91c490,1574987661.0,"So they’re burning it to try to promote positive energy in their part of the house. Nothing negative prompted it, I guess there was an article somewhere talking about how burning sage can relieve stress. I havent had much of a say in it but have not done it in my part of the house (upstairs) but if by chance it has been done up here I actually keep my window open 90% of the time. 

As for the first mundane thought: that’s what we’re trying to investigate, the scratches do look pretty troubling though. We have cats but they havent ever done anything like that in the 4 years we’ve had them.

First Woo thought: yeaaaaah that makes sense. I eventually brought up to them that maybe there is a presence in house but that got shut down pretty quickly. Im going to suggest that if they continue saging the house that they open the windows."
PokemonSwordAndShield,f87s1l7,t3_dzgy1g,1574341180.0,Id just like to say that I appreciate this post and this sub-reddit. I left r/pokemon months ago because it just turned into SwSh bashing. I went back into it yesterday and ~shockingly~ it’s still the same thing. But they always conveniently never have any of the articles posted that are like “this game is good”
pokemon,f861pm0,t3_dz3opm,1574287958.0,"I think it’s important to note that in earlier gens gym leaders and elite four members would have teams that covered their weaknesses. Ive noticed in gen 8 that isnt really the case anymore. The fire gym leader uses strictly fire type moves but no electric/grass moves to cover weaknesses. The dark gym leader doesnt have much to cover its weaknesses, or at least anything that’s hard-hitting. Ive also played all the games since Yellow but definitely feel the newer games hold your hand more than older games. The dungeons are shorter and much more linear, the trainer AI isnt ever much of a threat, there are typically healers before and sometimes even straight after a small cave whereas in older games you would have to backtrack if you wanted to get fully healed for your HP/PP. You can access your pc boxes of pokemon on the go. The inclusion of exp candies let you get high-leveled quickly, and the exp share giving your whole team exp as opposed to just one adds to that. Also in gen 6 there was the whole “here take this super overpowered Lucario/Latios/Latias for free!!!” thing that always felt weird to me. And then the fact that pokemon that used to only spawn in a specific room of a specific cave, or had to be found by doing the whole honey-tree thing, or could only be given to you after you beat the main story are just kind of wandering around and easily found thus making them feel less like a rarity. 


Granted, I love these games and am enjoying Shield more so than any of the other recent pokemon games, but I do think the added conveniences have made the games far more easier, or at least comparatively easier than gen 2-5.

But hey none of these criticisms from me are coming from a bad place because I think these added conveniences have made the games far more welcoming to newer/younger players and that’s what matters.  A lot of us have been playing these games for 20+ years now and know all of the ins and outs, so having new mechanics thrown in to shake things up a bit is welcome."

I say all of this because one of my best friends committed suicide this week. The amount of guilt, and the amount of unanswered questions left seem endless at this point.

At this point we all probably know Chris Morgan as the guy who went on an expletive filled rant at Bagel Boss a few days ago. This rant was for whatever reason mainly directed at women (evidently somebody behind the counter had smirked at him) and the video ends with him being tackled and then eventually pushed out of the fine bagel eatery. 

But Chris’s story doesnt start here, oh no. Our pal Chris has a whole youtube channel full of videos of him fishing, palling around with his friends, and casually going on various racist, sexist, and xenophobic rants towards various victims in videos where he films himself and the victims so that he can document everything. 

Here’s the youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdDBTzbfMnCRvwBv-ZaVsIg 

Recently, Chris was interviewed by Inside Edition, in a short (no pun intended) interview where he equates himself to Martin Luther King Jr in terms of martyrdom , refers to other men taller than his 4’11 stature as “bullies” and again goes into another rant against women all while being interviewed by a woman who is much taller than him. 

Here’s the link to that interview:  https://youtu.be/lzCpYB2M7T4

mentalhealth,et99bbv,t3_cajncm,1562590513.0,"So speaking as somebody who also struggles with that (and thank god im not the only one) I think it’s important to note that people who are schizophrenic often do not notice anything wrong with them. But the hyper-awareness of anxiety mixed with the deeply rooted cyclical thinking of OCD can definitely make you feel like you’re about to just implode on yourself and have a total psychotic break. 

Honestly, going outside or for a walk helps me in those situations. Also, cutting back on caffeine or switching over to tea can help as well (i could go on and on about how great tea is). Listen to some podcasts, stretch. Hell, just breath. Allow the thoughts to be there, see what happens if you dont fearfully cling to them wondering why they’re there or how they got there in the first place. Saying things like “it’s like this right now, and that’s okay” helps my anxiety so much and kind of breaks the obsessive cycle for me as well.
