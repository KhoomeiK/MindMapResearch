college,fpos6wc,t1_fporf63,1588789749.0,"Yeah I'm not sure how common it is, but it is a thing. I think from my experience in college is most (not all, but most) professors and school are aware college students don't have the most money and are usually pretty good at accommodating if you can't get the book for a while or at all. Most of my professors would have extra copies to use if you went to office hours/tutoring or the library may have had copies to rent out. I know with the whole pandemic going on it makes things harder though. Worst case like the other reply said you can usually find really cheap or even free versions or .pdf's of textbooks. They may be different editions but it's better than nothing.

However if you need a community college system that does do that check out Alamo Colleges. San Antonio, TX based community college system that has 5 or so pretty good size community colleges all combined into one system. If you are a student at one school you can enroll in classes at any campus with in-district tuition and many classes include the textbook in the tuition. I believe they have quite a few entirely online programs and associates degree programs as well."

college,fo1xwga,t3_g544y9,1587444158.0,"one thing i do is if i know i’m going to be taking a class that may be difficult for me, i’ll watch youtube videos on the subject to build up an understanding of the topic before going in. for instance i was worried accounting would be difficult so over christmas break i watched a youtube series over financial accounting so that i knew what to expect going in. it really helps to have a grasp of the subjects before going in! so if you’re worried about whatever math, science, etc. you’ll be taking your first year, look up your degree plan for your school and decide what you’ll need/want to take and then start doing research on the topic early!

what works for me is setting a written schedule of when assignments are due, tests are happening, etc. when everything is organized it’s easier to look at in smaller chunks rather than the big picture and stressing over every class at once. also i like to decide at the beginning of each week (say sunday) what assignments i’m going to do on what days and at what time. try to keep your online schedule just as organized as your on campus one! i find that starting my work is the hardest part and once i get started it really isn’t that bad, you know? just say, “i’m going to do this assignment for this class on thursday at 2pm!” and do it then. once you start looking at your schedule in smaller chunks and in a more organized way it makes things seem a lot less overwhelming.

also just remember that this is your last semester and it’s already almost over anyways! you can stick it out for a couple more weeks, right? just remember all the work you’ve put into your education up until this point and realize how close you are to getting it done!!! why not just finish it on the right foot? a couple weeks of dedication and it’s over!!

gaming,fmlzdyv,t3_fw327y,1586195952.0,"I think if you like fps and fast-paced gameplay then Borderlands would be more fun for you. Borderlands is more co-op in terms of being story focused. Each of your friends can play a different class (there’s 4 in BL3).

Diablo 3 has a story but it’s much shorter and more of a stepping stone to reaching the real game imo. Most people run rifts to grind for armor sets and legendaries, etc. Diablo 3 also has very fun classes that look and play very differently. It’s a top-down rpg as well, so it will feel a lot different than an fps. 

Both are very good games and a lot of fun, but I think Borderlands 3 is probably going to be more fun for your group."

truegaming,fhwksy7,t1_fhwkchk,1581919066.0,"I think that’s one of the things that is so unique about Borderlands is it’s ability to have a great balance between childish and mature in one franchise. Yes, it’s very over the top and ridiculous at times, but much of the story is actually pretty deep and can be quite dark. The characters are some of my favorites in gaming as well. You really do feel for and become attached to several of them throughout the series. Also the game play tends to be quite fast paced with a lot of things going on at once and each class gets their own unique play styles and skills which do a great job at making gameplay ACTUALLY different from another class. The replayability in Borderlands is great because there’s always different classes, different builds or different loot to go for. If you enjoy farming for high level loot then this series is also for you. I think it’s the cream of the crop in terms of looter shooters, with great fast paced gameplay, great story and great characters."

This will take you about 4 years in which you’ll have to take core classes (Math, Language, Arts, Science, etc.) as well as some undergraduate classes that are involved with your degree, so for example if your Bachelor’s is in Biology you’d be taking Biology classes as well. Once you’ve completed your Bachelor’s then you can apply to med school, which is pretty competitive so you’ll want to make sure you do well your first 4 years. Med school is pretty tough from what I’ve heard so it will take a lot of work and dedication, but is well worth it in the end.

socialskills,f3pw4b5,t3_dhrsr4,1571065890.0,"I think it probably depends more on the context, right? For example just talking loud in every scenario is probably not a great idea, you make come off as yelling or brash when you don’t mean to be. while always talking softly isn’t going to catch people’s attention if you’re in a loud public space or other setting like that.  I think it’s important to pay attention to who you’re talking to, the setting and the context of the conversation. 

Don’t worry about being too fast or slow. It sounds like you may feel awkward if there is a few seconds of silence? Silence doesn’t make people think you’re awkward or weird! Take that couple of seconds to gather your thoughts and think of a response! I like to ask questions about what someone has said in their last sentence. It’s an easy technique to keep conversation going since everyone enjoys talking about themselves!

Example:

Them: “Yeah I went to a music festival last weekend.”

There’s all kinds of questions you can ask from this! Such as what their favorite music is, how often they attend concerts, etc! Just don’t get flustered and take your time to think of a response!

mentalhealth,ez2eywj,t3_czuwr2,1567654960.0,"I can relate to your feeling of emotionlessness. I went through a long stretch where I felt emotionally numb and I get what you mean when you say that while your emotions are coming back now it also feels like you’ve “lost” part of your personality that you and others loved. I attributed it to the idea that I’d come out of a dark time and recovered, but being in such a dark period will certainly take a part of you with it if that makes sense. 

I think you should really try to really focus on who you are today. It seems to me like you’re really caught up in who you used to be and that it could be holding you back. It sounds like you have a lot going for you considering you mention that you can be social when you choose to be and you can make people laugh which are both really great tools to meeting cool new people and maintaining current friendships! I’d say in terms of your friends, it may not be that they don’t care as much about you but maybe you give them vibes of not being as outgoing or social so they probably just automatically assume you’ll not want to hang out, you know? It sounds strange, but that’s definitely a thing. (Once I began showing people that I was willing to initiate hanging out I suddenly began receiving more invitations to hang out in return!) I would say really start trying to be the person who initiates your friendships! Don’t hesitate to text your friend group asking to make plans or to try and meet new people! Once your current (or new friends) realize that you are engaging and take initiative then they’ll start to change their view of you being more antisocial and begin inviting you out more! If your efforts aren’t reciprocated back from your current friend group then you can always go meet new people! You really seem like a cool person but maybe the vibe you give off is just not resonating with others right now. Also, it does sound like they care about you so definitely don’t just drop them as friends right away! 

Lastly, I’d say don’t fall into the trap of trying to go out with the main purpose of just trying to find a girl to date! The best relationships will happen naturally through people you meet. You’ll honestly just make yourself feel more shitty and lonely if you try to find a girl for the purpose of dating rather than if it happens naturally because you’ll start to base your self worth off of wether or not you can get a girl to like you. Plus, if a relationship happens naturally you’re bound to really like that person more for who they are rather than them just being that girl who was willing to date you, you know? You’ll find someone, you seem like a really cool person!

Obviously I’m not a licensed doctor so I can’f diagnose you, but I used to experience similar symptoms with paranoia and hearing voices and I’m currently diagnosed with schizophrenia. It is common for people with psychotic disorders to experience symptoms such as paranoia, auditory and visual hallucinations, separation from reality, etc. Obviously, these can impact your life if untreated so I would really recommend scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist to determine what they think the best course of action is for you.

Don’t be upset or afraid if they do diagnose you with anything by the way, even if they decide you may have something, most people with a psychotic disorder are fully functioning people and live healthy lives!

college,exa9jlk,t3_crwqgi,1566102624.0,"I was in a sort of similar situation where I had to withdraw from a university I was attending only a few weeks into my freshman year. From what I was told by the staff at that college is once you are accepted into a college, I believe they keep your file and enrollment for another 2 years. I could have been given wrong information, but they should still have your transcripts and everything and as far as I know you should already be accepted to UW Seattle if you were when you first applied. 

It’s probably too late to enroll in classes for this semester, but you should be able to in the Spring or a flex semester that starts later in the fall if it’s anything like public universities in Texas! 

However, I was told if you go to a different college and want to transfer your credits over, then you’d have to apply as a transfer student and not an incoming freshman. 

This is what I was told and I followed this and haven’t had any problems so far! I would still highly recommend checking with the applications and business offices at your school to confirm as each college and state will be different. 

But as far as I know, you should be fine switching to UW Seattle with no problems. You may just have to miss this semester.

I would say if you don’t like math then computer science probably won’t be your thing. Even if you’re not great at it, but don’t mind it, you’ll be able to pass the required classes, but if you find yourself not enjoying math then it’s not going to be fun! 

The actual programming courses will be a blast though! They’ll probably start you off in Java or Python. Those classes were so much fun for me to start coding. 

Honestly I’d say try it out and if you end up not liking comp science there’s nothing wrong with changing majors. It’s very common! But you could also end up loving it! You’ll never know if you don’t try it out.

Best of luck!"

personalfinance,evpzp11,t3_ckrzgk,1564683449.0,If you’re above 18 (possibly 21) I believe you can begin using the stock market to purchase ETF’s or blue chip stocks that provide dividends. Dividends will (slowly) but steadily provide compound interest on your investments assuming you reinvest those dividends towards more shares of stock. Since you’re in high school that may not be plausible though if you’re not yet a legal adult.  It’s definitely something to look into and research in my opinion. Good luck and really good work saving up that money!

Things I love:
1. The farming - I love all of the great boss fights and that feeling you get when you FINALLY get the drop you want is so awesome. Unfortunately, the Pre Sequel kinda lacked in this. Borderlands 2 was amazing at it.
2. The characters and story - There are so many memorable characters in this series. Claptrap, Roland, Lilith, Hammerlock, Scooter, Ellie, Mr. Torgue and of course Brick! They’re great. The story is awesome too. Handsome Jack is a great villain. 
3. I love the art-style of the game - The colors and design are so unique and pretty to look at.

Things I hate:
1. I think elements can sometimes be a bit lackluster - Slag was a bit annoying because it was just so good you almost HAD to use it in BL2.
2. I didn’t like the Oz Kits and no gravity feel in TPS much. I got used to it but the movement wasn’t as nice as it was in BL2. 
3. Personally I’m not a fan of Badass Rank so I just turn it off.. but that’s not an issue with the game whatsoever it’s me being petty. 

Overall they’re phenomenal games. I still say BL2 is the best with BL1 close behind it, however, TPS is a very underrated game. They’re all great."

AskReddit,eunbfb5,t3_ch0kkl,1563926615.0,Nothing too bad actually. I accidentally broke a kid’s leg in middle school football by falling on it when he was at an awkward angle. Other than that a guy at a local gym was wearing a wristband playing basketball that caught his pinky and I think he ended up breaking that.. Nothing terrible so I’m lucky for that.

Only thing is killers can camp hooks. It’s annoying but not overly common."
