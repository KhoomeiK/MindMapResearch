But: In my experience, voice is less about drafts/editing and more about developing a good ear.

When do you write? I write with the most authentic voice when I’ve recently read something that made me jump up to my keyboard. 

Read with intention. Find an author who’s voice you love, like those you mentioned, and analyze every. word. Even the periods! Spaces! There’s a choice behind every keystroke and paying attention will encode it in your subconscious. What’s the emotional affect on the reader of *that* adjective vs *this* one? Start reading contemporary material as well because their voice will sound more natural and imitable. 

Start paying attention to your surroundings, too. How people talk and react to one another, the times they flinch in discomfort, how the sky at that certain time of year makes you feel and why, etc. things you wouldn’t even tell your therapist. keep a daily journal of this stuff. 

To be honest, though, I’ve noticed in classes that some people just have *that* x-factor and many don’t, even people who’ve read their entire lives.

But, to be fair, the whole identity thing started as a reaction to people NOT acknowledging disadvantaged populations. And, if you read quality contemporary literature the authors don’t usually depend on identity as art, it seems more prevalent amongst younger writers/pop culture"
BodyAcceptance,ewlqn0g,t1_ewdovb6,1565533287.0,"You know, maybe you’re right. I noticed one of my friends was a lot nicer to me when I started being vulnerable and trying to connect with her. 

Thank you. This was nice to read, and probably necessary. I guess I have always had a hard time making friends in both social and professional settings and I always wondered if it had anything to do with my race and how I looked. 

I hope you have a good day."
BodyAcceptance,ew5gh27,t1_ew5b2gr,1565135686.0,"I agree. People don’t care about others nearly as much as they care about themselves. 

It’s a subconscious thing. People are less forgiving of mistakes/gaffes if you deviate from the the norm in some way, whether this is appearance, race, etc. I’ve noticed people warm up to one of my friends a lot quicker now, for instance, because she became beautiful whereas before they thought she was awkward. She noticed it too. 

It’s human nature. I can’t stop being friends with everyone. 

Thanks for your advice though!"

Cute though."

I’m envious, gotta be honest. When I was 16 I was still in denial that choked me up. The girl she likes and her admitted that they liked each other, and I’m kinda sad I hadn’t even come out to myself until this time last year, let alone had an experience like that yet. 

But, my heart is full knowing I’m not the only one in the family anymore ❤️"

I’m great at pattern recognition if all necessary information is presented to me, but what holds me back is memory. That is, I don’t have one. My strongest memories are tied to extreme emotions- the rest are clouded. 

I don’t really know what to do about this. Feelings can be an impediment."
intj,evlenrl,t3_ck6p1t,1564593773.0,"The best definition of meaning I’ve come to is the unknown. 

Once we reach the goal, once we solve the mystery, the meaning evaporates. 

If a god hopped down in front of you when you died and was like “life is eternal!” You’d probably question what the meaning of the afterlife is while you’re chilling on a cloud or something. As long as you can rationalize, There’s no end to it.

So no, from my experience it’s not meaningful because meaning is a wobbly invented term that probably was meant to represent some other concept entirely. 

Try to have a pleasant rest of the day."

Relatable. 

But seriously, they burned up so fast. 

Anne Carson’s “the glass essay” is a neat exploration of Emily Bronte if you liked this, btw. She was lonely as heck.

I started off with celexa and by the third night was in the ER for an extreme panic attack/suicidal ideation. As in, I had to remove my earrings hours before because Id keep getting the urge to stuff them in my throat to try to asphyxiate myself. Before this I had chills, nausea, couldn’t sleep for three nights straight and was subsequently placed on sleep medication. 

I hope this isn’t a warning against ADs! Please please PLEASE go to a professional if you’re considering suicide. I’ve been told my situation was an anomaly. 

Also- something switched in my brain after stopping celexa and I’ve been doing ok. Treading the waters, but ok. Medication is weird like that."

Childhood is a lot closer to lord of the flies than... idk, Disney channel? Than we admit.

I’m sorry you went through that. But, I’m not really, because like you I went through it too and honestly, it’s more complicated than just wishing it hadn’t happened. It’s funny in a way, but also makes you want to punch a doorframe, but also so many other things ..."

The anxiety around not admitting it would make it spiral out of control until the real attraction mixed with fear/shame/guilt and it was code red 100% of the time around these people and I couldn’t even meet their eye while talking to them. So embarrassing. 

Admit it to yourself. It’s ok to feel attracted to people. People probably are attracted to you and you know it’s no big deal right? Probably flattering if anything."

Write and answer the questions honestly and you’ll meet the coolest people if nothing else.

No.
