Wicca,fgnz9e4,t3_ezk8vi,1580956185.0,I can get this for sure. This is all normal feelings to have and don't let it end what you feel is true to you.
Wicca,fglqj6l,t3_ez2ktl,1580908234.0,"I think that being able to relate on that subject of God, our higher power. Could all be relatable. Christians are in my family and I had trouble discussing God experiences but now I can without feeling too uncomfortable because I understand the concept better but as far as Christian readings I personally do not follow it."
BPD,fgl153s,t3_elm39b,1580878825.0,"I felt this alot when I was younger. I get that way SOMETIMES now. Not often because well I've just been overweight. Life is hard but all I can say is learn to love yourself everything about you. Learning to love myself, I'm 29 years old and it all feels sort of new for me to love myself. I have bad moments don't get me wrong. Things do get easier if you learn your thought patterns and such. Not sure if they makes sense but just remember, love yourself that may be what you need. Being understanding to our on self. Your existence."

BPD,fc72td6,t3_egj4ej,1577496027.0,My husband and I have had arguments because he sits at his computer alot never considering the fact that maybe he just doesn't feel comfortable anywhere else in our house. I sat at my computer allot as a teenager then I actually met him. I've been up his butt ever since if he's not at work but he does stay at the computer alot. Something I am thinking about now.
