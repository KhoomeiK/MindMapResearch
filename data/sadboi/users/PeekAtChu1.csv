GenderCritical,fr5yhs4,t3_gkcmhj,1589916790.0,"My main issue with trans people is that they have an unfair advantage over normal women...like they were raised like men, they are still stronger than us, they still don’t have our reproductive organs, and they like to snipe our deserved spots in sports teams and high status jobs under the guise of female advancement. 

Real women don’t have a choice about who we are. Many of us would rather not even be women because we are not taken seriously and we have to deal with the expected role of being mothers and caregivers. We face so many more problems than these fakes who just marginalize our existences to mean wearing lipstick and being sexy to men. 

It’s a rocky road for us just to make the realization that we have been groomed to support men, and make the effort to be independent. Whereas these trans people were raised with the male mindset that they must be independent and aim for success."
