 When I first started my campaign with Nottingham Forest, I really wanted to start unloading older players and using that money to invest in good prospects, but I realized that doing so would've most definitely upset team chemistry and morale. Furthermore, these older guys can serve as great mentors and help your youngsters grow. 

Plus, more often than not you can sign a good older player for much less. My 25-year old keeper has $8m value, but I plan on selling him and saving money by signing an older keeper who's just as good for only a small fraction of the cost."

- What exactly is the point of using ""Rest"" (i.e. rest for 1 day)? Will it help them recover stamina faster?

- I play a 4-1-4-1 and I've noticed my wingers aren't really effective, even if I instruct them to attack. They just race the ball down the flank and cross it with little to no actual effectiveness. Any tips here?

- Is it common to switch up formations throughout a season, or even game-by-game basis? I was once told that doing so would really mess up team chemistry and it would be best to just use 1 formation all the time, just with tweaked tactics."

illnessfakers,fekb4po,t3_epl9gq,1579196364.0,"As somebody currently recovering from both anorexia and bulimia (9 days binge+purge free according to the SoberTime app!!), I can admit that I've done all of these things. Why? Because you finally feel proud of yourself for accomplishing a goal: feeling comfortable within the confines of your own body. You feel a false sense of confidence which pushes you to try harder.

Of course, she definitely wasn't walking 20 miles per day. However at the height of my illness I was most definitely over-exercising to the point of physical exhaustion; I'd resupplement my body with protein bars and Gatorade Zero to replenish electrolytes, and I would do this regularly in the spring and summer.

I wouldn't say that I was *bragging* per se; I was more so delighted with the fact that I was finally able to drop the weight and finally felt more comfortable with my own body. But that's disordered thinking empowered by disordered thought processes and actions. Now, I'm trying my hardest to stay ""clean"" and help others do the same, though recovery is a difficult process.

In regards to this particular person, it sounds as if they're most definitely insecure: Not only has she committed to losing weight and maintaining a particular set goal weight, but she's fishing for attention as well. The eating disorder combined with attention-seeking is quite telling if you ask me; it seems as if she's desperate for it.

It's truly a shame. She needs a wakeup call, for sure. :("
