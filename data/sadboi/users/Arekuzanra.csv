TwoXSex,fp8l4g7,t3_gbxtkk,1588395207.0,""" The hymen can stretch or tear as a result of various behaviors, by tampon or menstrual cup use, pelvic examinations with a speculum, regular physical activity, sexual intercourse, insertion of multiple fingers or items into the vagina, and activities such as gymnastics (doing 'the splits'), or horseback riding."" - [Wikipedia (with other sources)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen)

Also, if a man says you ""don't feel like a virgin,"" he is not a man you should be having sex with because he's clearly not mature enough for sex. Besides, why should you have to be the virgin and he be ""experienced"" enough to know what a virgin should or shouldn't feel?

If you **want** to try penetration with a toy, go for it! Don't give a shit what anyone else thinks now or later. Do what **you** want to do for **you**. Plus, if you want to learn your body better and find what you do and don't like, it really helps for when it's time to go to bed with a partner.

If you do decide to go for a penetrative toy, get a water-based lubricant. You can ***neeeeeeever*** have too much lube when you're trying things out. You may think you feel tight because you don't have anything to compare it to, and you probably won't afterward either. The vagina is strong. She can birth an entire 7 - 9 lb human and she'll go right back to being tight (of course, I'm sure there is a tad bit of looseness, but oops babies and second marriages don't just magically happen).

TL;DR -- Love yourself, learn yourself, love your vagina and give her fun toys to play with, and everyone else can go fuck themselves."

BorderlinePDisorder,fp14hyh,t3_gaoh0t,1588224174.0,"I had a few diagnosis options I was cycling through, and I gave each of them to my counselor. He explained some common symptoms/behaviors of people who have those disorders/conditions. I went with ADHD first, then bipolar, then BPD, and this was based off some loose research I'd done at a friend's recommendation.

I went home and I thought about the explanations he'd given me. BPD resonated with me, so I read up on it more. It resonated with me a bit too much, so I asked my psychiatrist (who was treating me for moderately severe depression and moderate anxiety) if I was on the proper medications for someone who could have BPD. She pulled out this little fancy therapist book thing and she asked me a series of questions. Based on my answers, she said, ""Yeah, it sounds like you do."" and then she made sure my medications were the right ones to help (which they were), and she recommended Dialectical behavior therapy (**DBT**).

So, the tl;dr would be: My doctor told me because I asked her about it and she listened."
BorderlinePDisorder,fp13d6v,t3_gap95w,1588223290.0,"Bring it up. I brought it up to a counselor, and he explained the common signs of those with borderline. We didn't settle on it at the time; however, the more I read up on it, and the more I thought about what that counselor had said, I asked my psychiatrist (a different person, a woman -- context: I'm a woman as well) if I was on the right kind of medication for someone who could be suffering from BPD. She pulled out a handy little book, asked me some questions, said ""Yup, sounds like it.""  and recommended that I try a therapy method called DBT.

If your current counselor/therapist offers DBT services, AWESOME. Ask them to work with that. But if not, ask for a referral to a counselor/therapist who CAN give you that form of therapy. DBT is one of the most effective forms of therapy that words for us fun people who struggle with overwhelming BPD symptoms.

At worst, look up DBT and/or DBT workbooks and see if what you're reading resonates with you. I still highly recommend bringing it up, just because it is a valid concern if you're someone who had a hard time with emotional regulation. You don't even have to be specifically diagnosed with BPD to have problems with emotional regulation. It just tends to be a common symptom of BPD.

I'm not a professional, but I remember being nervous about bringing it up. I brought it up to a counselor, he explained it. I brought it up to a psychiatrist, she diagnosed it. I told that counselor about my diagnosis and he recommended me to a DBT counselor. 

Also, don't be afraid to tell your counselor WHY you've been nervous about bringing it up. That can also be a symptom or a behavior that can be worked upon as well. You think you're exaggerating. I get that, too. I hate it, too. Which is why I seek help for it.

Open that line of communication. If she criticizes you or brushes off the idea without exploring it, then it's time to get a new counselor."

ibs,fadywv5,t3_e8kee9,1575989880.0,"Strangely enough, my cat had the same issue. Her cause was due to stress from having to share a house (and litter boxes) with 4 other cats while I had a roommate living with me. The thing that the vet was worried about was damage to the nerves in her colon that could make it so she might not have been able to poop on her own again.

After we cleared out as much of the obstructions as we could, and she's been doing a lot better these past several months.

Moral of why the above could be relevant is it could possibly be something up with the nerves in your colon:

They can better explain whether it's your medication that causes it, or if it's just as simple as an age thing (women 18 - 25 are more in their prime for reproducing, so it's logical that we may see an increase of vaginal discharge following after ovulation but before your period.

**I am not a medical professional. Just have the experience of being a woman who menstruates."
Periods,eugs01b,t3_cg5jim,1563813787.0,"I have IBS-D and I noticed the first day or so, I'd actually be kinda constipated. But then day three and four, the flood gates let loose and its just a whole mess of no fun.

There's a lot going on down there when we're on our periods. We have uterus contractions and our pelvic muscles tend move and stretch to compensate. You'll sometimes feel this pain in the pelvic region along where your panty line is in the front.

The combination of angry organs and muscles down there absolutely can stimulate the bowels and can result in constipation or diarrhea.

Not to mention you're probably stressing out because periods suck major butt, and stress is a BIG factor when it comes to the stomach, and IBS. Mine is triggered by stress/anxiety, but I believe it also has to do with the fight-or-flight response that occurs when someone is under a lot of stress or when their anxiety peaks.

likeus,etzufub,t1_etzh437,1563337220.0,"It's their prey instinct, especially when it comes to certain breeds. However, dogs tend not to be like that around cats they know and live with. When I let my dogs outside, if there is a foreign cat in the yard or across the street, they chase it to the gate. Inside the house, though, I have a terrorist kitten who is a wild child and the dogs don't even bother lifting their heads from the couch.

This is why, though, when you go to shelters to adopt older dogs, you have to pretty much find one who has lived with cats before. Otherwise, if you get a puppy, it's a bit easier because they can grow up alongside the cats and get used to them that way. But they will still have that instinct to chase anything that they don't recognize off their property, including cats, squirrels, etc."
antiMLM,eslmhue,t3_c83g00,1562088196.0,"More along the lines for covering yourself in the future, I would recommend setting any post you may feel could be controversial to be viewed by Friends-only.  Many employers worry about how their people represent the brand of their own company. Even if what you're saying has nothing to do with your job. It won't stop your colleagues/bosses from reading the posts if you're friends with them, but it will typically blow up in their face because the only argument they could have is ""I don't care for your opinion."" which most certainly is no grounds to get written up or fired.

Good luck with dealing with your boss, whenever he decides he's ready to talk! You don't have anything specifically against his wife, and the fact that she's kindhearted and you recognize that will definitely work in your favor in explaining that your boss's wife was, in no way, a prime target for what you posted."

I was watching someone do a Let's Play (Raptor on Youtube) and he was able to move his original trader spot by deconstructing the homes near where the trader came + deconstructing the hearth.  I want to say it was the deconstruction (and reconstruction at another location) of the homes that was the factor, but I haven't had an opportunity to test it myself.

Anxiety,epzaiaa,t3_bwav0n,1559661797.0,"I have IBS due to my anxiety, and last year I went through some major stress that put me out of commission for months. Could barely eat, throwing up a lot, shitting my brains out. Now I just deal with IBS and a bit of nausea.

Studies have said that the stomach has a brain of its own that sometimes can react to changes in the main brain, but can also function individually should the body believe its in danger. Anxiety kicks off our fight or flight instincts, so it doesn't surprise me that the body either shuts down the digestive profess, or immediately tells the body to evacuate everything and get ready to fight or run."
