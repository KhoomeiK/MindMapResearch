Such as a paint brush, pencil, jump rope handle, Pez dispenser, etc. She asked if my dad ever stuck things inside of me and it was later clear to me her dad was molesting her and she was working shit out. It didn't hurt and she wasn't violent about it. In turn I immediately went on to experiment with a boy my age. At 8, a boy in my class would touch me under those bulky desks and it was an inconvenience at most. I had the same experience of not at all caring this shit happened. I also find it invalidating that this victim narrative is pushed on us. I hope that girl forgot all about it and she's alright."
