Journaling,fq3kgs9,t3_ggpkow,1589067381.0,"I'm sorry that you're going through this. My number one tip for journaling with therapy is not to force youself to write right after the session. If you need to, take the time to recuperate, then come back to your journal.


What I do after a session is that I briefly describe the main points we talked and what went through my mind as we were talking. I usually do this after a long walk so right after i write about how I felt afterwards and about any conclusions I might have reached. 


We tend to set a topic for the next week so I keep it at the back of my mind and when I feel I have a nugget of insight I sit down to write down everything i can think of that could affect that topic. If i ever figure something out during my everyday journaling i mark the side of passage with a marker so it's easier to find. 


One time I had to track a symptoms for two weeks and i used page flags of different colours to indicate severity. It's a quick technique, but in your case it could be useful to track specific emotions or when you used tools & strategies.


My type of therapy isn't focused on shot term goals so this isn't I've tried myself, but you could make a loose series of questions to answer any time you use a tool so you can track your progress and compare the different strategies. Something like ""how did I feel before?, What reminded me to use this tool/why did I choose this tool?, What was it like to use this tool/How well did it work?, How do I feel now?, How difficult was it to use this tool?, How does this affect my journey towards my goal?"" 


For some general advice, try to be as honest as possible. When feelings about your husband or your therapist come up write about it and if you're starting to think there might be a link between an emotion, a behaviour, an event, whatever, write about it, even if you're not sure there really is a connection. 

Let your therapist know that you journal! It will not only show them how invested you are, but they might also have some suggestions for you. Therapy is really hard and it sucks a lot of the time, but I wish you all the best."

Journaling,fpxfa8k,t3_gfzb07,1588981572.0,"I finished a journal a couple of days ago and for the very last page I switched to writing to my journal, a bit like a letter. I dont usually address my entries to anyone so it was an interesting change to mark the end."
Journaling,fpvkxrf,t3_gfsqjm,1588946869.0,"I have three main journaling modes:

1. It's the end of the Day and i haven't written anything yet. 
In this case I'll write a couple of sentences to recap my day either leave it there or keep writing depending on how i feel.


2. I'm coming to my journal with something to write about. 
It might be as simple as something funny someone said but a lot of the time i end up writing a couple of sentences of self reflection. If I'm writing about something i realized after talking to my therapist, a dream or another emotionally charged topic I follow the same process of describing the event then digging deeper except that it usually takes much longer (often up to a few pages).


3. I want to write, but I dont have anything specific to write about.
Sometimes I just start to write, sometimes i write song lyrics, i do a tarot spread and journal about it, i look back on my entries for the week and see if i have more to add; anything to get me started. 


The heavy self reflection is by far the best part of my journaling, especially now that ive started therapy. My thoughts tend to be so cluttered and writing them down allows my mind to quiet down and focus on the important conclusions.

Right now I dont reread past entries very often because there are a lot of sad ones to avoid, but i love looking back and finding small everyday things that were part of my routine I had forgotten about."
Journaling,fpvi8ya,t3_gfrh9i,1588945330.0,"I had a journal here and there when i was a kid but I was never consistent. I decided to pick it back Up again in fall 2015. A lot of people were telling me not to force myself to write so i ended up only writing here and there. As a result i almost have no record of some of the most impactful events of my life because what was happening was too painful to write about and/or since journaling wasnt an habit yet when things got rough my first impulse wasnt to write about it.

ABraThatFits,fbs9c8c,t1_fbrht4n,1577052041.0,"Im a 30H and most aeries bralettes dont work, but this summer i was able to find one with no underwire that worked because the cups went high enough so there was no spillage. Your best bet is to go to a store and to try on a bunch of stuff. Depending on if you want to wear it as a shirt or a bra some styles will work better than others, but aeries is decent overall."

Journaling,fb7gzg9,t3_ebtx6j,1576589728.0,"I always keep my journal in my backpack. It's an habit from being younger and being terrified of my mom reading it, but i also like to bring it everywhere. 


Im not afraid of forgetting it somehwhere, but again, i never really kose anything. Journaling on the go is something i love too much to give it up. I find that being in a different physical space allows me to access different emotions while im writing; it's also a great excercise in noticing!"

Journaling,fb3b8mg,t3_eb7i1y,1576468574.0,Journaling is a big help when it comes to dealing with emotions. I have a hard time identifying what im feeling so writing helps put a name to it. When my emotions are overwhelming it allows me slowly decompress instead of turning towards negative coping mechanisms.
bigboobproblems,f7jz2t8,t1_f7jxn3q,1573790170.0,"I cant be bothered to care about lingerie as anything other than functional because i dont have many options. Even in specialty stores there are very few options for my size and shape. For me bras are so that i dont have to hold my chest in public and to achieve a certain look under clothes, and even when i want to look sexy i dont need the brand to be 'feminist' (i dont believe in capitalism ever being such a thing), i just need to feel good. I would rather support a brand that makes my size without proclaiming themselves as my hero. Im under no illusion that these companies care about little more than profit so a bit of feminist branding won't be enough to win me over."
bigboobproblems,f7ealhi,t3_dvjbgi,1573652384.0,"I dont like it. Ive never seen one of those ads for a company that actually made my size and i consider myself to be quite average so i dont know by what standard they would be considered size inclusive.


A lot of those companies use the type of feminism that says ""bras are torture instruments!!! Buy wireless superduper supportive feminist bralette and be free of the male gaze!!!""


I think it's based on the myth that bras (and corsets and stays) were developped by men for their own pleasure so not only does it erase the work of women artisans and innovators, but it also reduces historical womanhood to the upperclass by forgetting that working class women laboured in their underwear and did not follow trends such as tightlacing.


There was an AMA a couple of weeks ago w ith one of those companies. They offered a basic bralette un a few sizes and for a super high price and proclaimed themselves to be feminist heroes. Their size range and support was similar to VS. Just because they know that marketing to a 'woke' base requires diff√©rent method doesn't make one of those companies more feminist than the other.  It's still capitalism trying to make a buck from a problem they made worse in the first place."

bigboobproblems,f48g0xc,t3_djp3u1,1571438370.0,"I got mine done a little bit over a year ago and they are still not fully healed :/


When i was researching piercers in my area two shops kept coming up as safe and good at their job so i picked the one that was closest to me. I got them done on Day 12 of my cycle because that's when my nipples tend to be the less sensitive. 


Getting them done was no big deal, but my nipples burned like crazy for a couple of hours after. I was wearing a lightly lined bra that gave me no compression, but in the next couple of days i much prefered going braless (less painful unless you hit anything).


The biggest issue has been the piercings getting caught in things (like a shower door. That was hell) which is pretty terrible for healing. Im a lot more aware of where my chest is now lol.


I still get swelling before my period, but that could just be my nipples doing their thing. Im very happy with them, but since my boobs change so much throughout my menstrual cycle somedays my shape is so affected that the piercing are a bit crooked. It's not super noticeable tho"

birthcontrol,f3yr4yt,t1_ew32meu,1571258220.0,"Who started this petition? As someone who can only be on Depo or get an IUD the ""numerous alternatives are available"" statement is quite offensive. Depo is already not a first choice for people who have other options so i dont see how banning it would be better than saying it should only be prescribed if absolutely necessary. 

Also it's quite dishonest not to mention that the petition is about the increased risk for HIV transmission and not anything that OP mentioned..."
