someone i no longer speak to told me that i need to be good to myself and love myself and only ever depend on myself bc im the only person i know will always be here til i die. and ive come to learn that bc i can love others, i can love myself. 
just keep those things in mind. love yourself and be good to yourself and only depend on yourself to do those things bc you’ll always have you. might as well be good to yourself since youre stuck w yourself for the rest of your life. it can be hard but even just feeling like youre lying to yourself is a start. tell yourself you the baddest bitch out there. that youre the prettiest princess of all the land (yes this applies to men too lol) and that people are lucky to ever have been with you or to be your friend. essentially fake it til you make it bc, at least in my experience, it works. take your time to yourself and you’ll be ready to move on. once you realise youre the only person you’ll ever need, and once you love yourself, you’ll be ready to move on. and that doesnt mean you gotta find someone to be with. it just means you’re ready to be happy regardless of if you’re in a relationship or single. 

i just feel so passionately about taking care of oneself bc for so long i was scared of being alone so i’d bounce from relationship to relationship so quickly and it ended in me being hurt and in a bad spot mentally but i finally took my time to work on myself and to make myself happy and to realise i’ll only ever need me. i only took a few months but that’s all i needed to fully appreciate my own existence and to finally depend on myself. 

if you ever need someone to talk to or give you advice, dm me. or seek therapy since im not a professional. i just kinda go to therapy myself and do my research and speak from personal experience and growth.

some survivors are ready to and okay with screaming it from rooftops and other’s just wanna keep it to themselves. and of course there’s everything in between. but i think a good place to start, if you wanna start telling people, is to tell someone you love and trust the most. which can still be hard but that normal and okay.  from personal experience, i find it hard to trust people. i’ve gotten better over the years but it’s still tough. but i’m also a person who’s ready to tell someone i think is gonna stick around in my life potentially. 
like i said though, it’s really just person to person and where you’re comfortable and how you feel. that’s something people cant take from you and that you have control over, is your readiness to tell someone. whether you force yourself to tell someone, anyone. or you take your time to tell someone you trust, thats your decision that only you can make."

you could have had her sign a contract per say that you wrote up. 
i know you wouldn’t think to do this bc even i hadn’t until someone wrote up a contract for me to sign when selling my macbook. 
but basically it would protect you from getting in legal trouble if someone pulls what shes pulling. so long as you get a signature from her. or at least that’s my understanding of it. i think anyone can make up a contract and it counts as a sort of protection. 
thats to the best of my understanding tho. at the very least if would have given her proof that you made the purchase, sorta like a receipt in a way. or make a receipt w the item name and serial number or whatever and the price then have her sign it like you would if y out use a credit(?) card. just as a thing to prove to her. nothing legal about it unless it needs to be. 
physical or written proof will always come in handy when making purchases like that from someone you may not trust that well to not fuck you over in this way. 
again, this is to the best pf my knowledge and something i have moderate experience in."

Once I get the money, Im outta this place, i’ll bring two of my friends who also struggle since theyre in the same boat as me with being able to message their people and they just sell it or trade it to them without question. 
Im sorry you lost so many people and your father ruined so much. I truly hope everything is all good now."
insaneparents,f49gyzw,t3_djzmtt,1571465825.0,"i’d like to also point out that over my lifetime my mom has been emotionally and physically abusive to not only me but my little brother who isnt mentioned in this post. she treats my one brother whom i owed money and my sister like he prized possessions but bc my other brother and i are emotionally “unstable “ she’s so toxic to use. i can’t tell you how many times shes slapped me or called the cops on me and lied to them all bc i talked back or yelled at her. she’s even threatened to lie to the police when i was a minor and say my friends kidnapped me when she told me i could stay the night w them. my mom has also pulled me down a hallway my hair, put all her weight on top of me, hit me with my old schools macbook, and punched me. if i so much as ignore her when she’s picking a fight, she tries to kick me out of the house. then she cries on command so i feel bad and i have to apologise for something i didnt even do. 
she has told me since i was young that she didnt have to do shit for me. only since ive became an adult, does that actually apply."
insaneparents,f49g20s,t3_djzmtt,1571464918.0,"i owed my mom 20$ and my little brother 10$. i borrowed 20 from my mom and i sold some games for my brother but got less than expected so i kept the money and was going to give him money from my first check from my last job. 
long story short my second family is always broke bc the only person who can currently work is not mentally in the spot to work and the others are blind, worked themselves til they physically cant anymore, and too old. so i gave them money that i really didnt need bc my family is better off financially than they are and my second family needed groceries which arent cheap. i know it wasnt smart bc i owed money but i have too big of a heart to watch my second family struggle.  
keep in mind my check was only 43$ bc i hardly worked that pay period. but it’s MY money that i worked for. and i think i should decide where it goes and what happens w it. and i did, in fact, pay them back. 
but idk i just think it’s totally fucked she tried to kick my bf out and make us walk in the cold for 30 minutes when my bf had work in the morning and i had another interview in the morning as well. all bc i know my family is better off than my second family and can handle waiting another week or two for $30. 
there’s more fucked up things my mom does which i can further explain. in another comment."

AskReddit,f0lfb9v,t3_d5bek2,1568715210.0,"i started telling myself i was too beautiful and perfect to die. i hyped myself up and made myself feel like a bad bitch. bc no one else is reliable enough to do it for me. i relied on myself to make myself happy. it took years and years to get to the point where i can look in the mirror and say “thats one gorgeous person “, but i did it. sometimes what it takes, is feeling like youre lying to yourself until you believe what you say. 
time heals all wounds and you yourself are what speeds up the process."
