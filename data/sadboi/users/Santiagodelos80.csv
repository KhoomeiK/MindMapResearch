I did think that the pain relief was quite modest from Tramadol, and when I did have it - it would take the full dose before it kicked in (400mg). Headache started two years ago, when I got tonsilitis and it hasn‚Äôt gone since. I was taking cocodamol which I think was probably making it worse - so did a detox for two months to rule out mediation overuse headache. So now I‚Äôm on tramadol and I generally need to take at least 300mg in quick succession to get any relief :/"

prozac,fb76lhk,t3_ebsa8p,1576576760.0,It‚Äôs really difficult to say. My experience was I started to feel really good about 2 months into treatment. The problem was that my GP increased the dose during this time and it made me really ill. I eventually saw a psychiatrist who said that I was probably feeling the benefit from the lower dose as it takes a long time to start working (because of the long half life).
