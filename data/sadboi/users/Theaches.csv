We associate this phenomenon with 'disaster' because it can severely affect nearby Human communities, although keep in mind this has been occurring **FAR** before we got here and will continue **FAR** after we leave. To think we've labeled the evolution of our planet as a 'disaster', really gives perspective on how grandiose Humanity is.

More food for thought: If we witnessed something like this on another planet while being safe at home, how inclined would we be to label it a 'disaster'?"

Instagramreality,fqzhn2h,t3_glo5ud,1589767573.0,"This is such a layered issue and it aggravates me to see such a simple solution to a complicated issue, especially just to make people feel good. 

Modeling: I don't care if you're a guy or girl, if your profession is displaying your body, you better have a nice body. Men are expected to be muscular and lean (and tall lol) and the same applies to women. 

Obesity: This is an actual medical condition, anorexia is its equivalent. It's puzzling how blindly people will accept obesity yet someone who's anorexic is immediately recognized and helped. You can be chubby, you can be skinny, people come in all different heights weights sizes etc, and I agree 'gaining weight is not a mistake', but clearly gaining **too** much weight is. 

Instagram: Think about this woman taking these 4 photos, editing them together, creating the captions and posting it. This post didn't 'enlighten me' to the concept of gaining weight being acceptable, shit like that is *everywhere.* Although what it does do is create a 'positive feedback loop' where the girl featured will receive countless compliments like 'you're so strong' and 'you look beautiful'. Surface level there's nothing wrong with that, but now think of all the women making similar posts to get the same self esteem boost across the platform (the world). This woman looks fine, and she claims to agree, but ponder this: If she truly felt fine, she wouldn't of thought to make this post, but if she wasn't comfortable and wanted results she'd be in the gym. Whats between those 2 options? Project your insecurity to the public with some positive captions to change **their** perception to feel good, rather than working for the look you actually desire. 

Men: If it's not obvious enough I'm a man, 23 years old with a diploma in Strength and Sports. The amount of obese men I've met looking to make actual change to achieve their goal vs women is staggering, the reason? Fat men are looked at as pigs, you think a fat man could make a post like the one above and be taken seriously? Of course not, and ironically it's **women themselves** who would be the first to laugh. Men are left with 2 options, stay fat and be viewed as pigs or get in better shape. Contrast that with the support/acceptance women receive for being fat and it becomes mind boggling. 

Conclusion: I don't mean to put women on the spot, and I know plenty will read this and feel attacked, but understand that feeling isn't exclusive to women and men feel attacked all the time, the difference being men are expected to endure/adapt with no sympathy, while women are expected to do what? I've been sitting here 10 minutes and **every** example I think of could be labeled as 'misogynistic', so I struggle narrowing down an example. I understand why society could be labeled as a 'mans world', but most examples of men to support that idea are old, they're boomers. The boys you grew up with/went to school with aren't those men, but they are caged spectators to the perception of their peers, because who my/their grandfathers was/is highly impacts my identity today."

leagueoflegends,fqik1f9,t1_fqijr24,1589397033.0," I've been playing since season 2 and from my experience smurf accounts have only risen in popularity. Early seasons I swear people had 1 or 2 primary accounts that were their bread n butter which they couldnt afford to lose, incentivising good behavior. Fast forward and seemingly no one cares about their accounts because they have 10 others, when they get fucked in game instead of having to demonstrate resilience to make it through they just rage quit onto another account, not caring if the former account is perma banned. I had to make a second account after my primary account was perma banned, it was for being toxic to my own team (never the opposing) due to this very reason, people dont care and the system doesn't punish players for soft inting, only to the players highlighting it, where is the justice?

Riot has let the game get away from them. They talk about how 'you are only responsible for what YOU do' then go on to talk about how League is a team game. Okay then why would you ban a Teemo roaming support if its ONLY ABOUT WHAT YOU DO????????? So I can't do what I want because we NEED a team comp (so not for myself) yet if I do WHAT I DO as an individual I'm flamed and banned?? Get your fucking rules straight Riot because as is you've successfully steered the community into the ground, for fuck sakes do your fucking jobs and fix this shit.
