Eventually he temporarily cut contact with me when I jokingly said something about his then-current girlfriend. I made the split permanent. Took me ages to clue in the contact cutting happened whenever I'd mentioned serious stuff going on in my own life, so he'd use that to I guess friendship test me and indirectly cause me to further isolate myself from everyone else I knew at the time.

I think we're good by nature, but our actions can be seen as bad as often what is good for our group is not good for others. For example, I could vote a politician in who represents my views for the most part and who promises things for my area, but who'll de-fund projects for low income people and repurpose money meant for other areas to better fund the ones who mostly voted for him. I disagree with both of his choices above, but my concern over say a massive pothole which severely damaged my car multiple times finally being fixed would overrule them.
