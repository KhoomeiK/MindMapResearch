bathmate,fr3cbqz,t3_gmcr4i,1589854351.0,"Don't over do it. Take breaks every 3 days. Only 2 to 3, 5 minute sessions at a time.

Shave a little bit if the seal isn't as good as it can be. 

Warm ups, jelqing, and stretching might help speed up gains but again, don't over do it."

Fuck this, I'm playing something else. 

That's pretty much my experience with rocket league."

bathmate,fnir5sn,t3_g20enh,1586984911.0,"Yeah, it's a little bit too big. I reccomend getting just the hydro7. It's for dudes between 5 and 7 inches. Your spermatic tubes getting sucked in means you might need to re-adjust the suction a bit to make it more comfortable. (Also, comfort pads help a lot).

It just takes practice putting it on. It's not as easy as it looks at first, but you get used to putting it on that ""sweet spot""."
bathmate,fn6nhyq,t3_fzugd0,1586703476.0,"I was skeptical and afraid just like you, and I did lots of research and read a ton of testimonials. I've been using it for like 4 months consistently and I am very happy with it. No major gains yet but no injuries either.

I've gotten the donut effect and tiny red spots under the skin and my dick still works just fine. Just do three, five minute sessions (start with only 3 times a week to condition yourself) and I promise you'll be happy with the results. I'm about the same starting size as you, which is why I was interested in making a post for you. 

Just be careful and consistent; you will see gains. Keep an eye on your physiological indicators and take a break if you need it. Most importantly, enjoy yourself. I've enjoyed sitting by myself in the bath, fully present with the thing on my dick. It's a nice sensation."

NoFap,ffum0sj,t1_ffugfne,1580244801.0,"That's awesome man. I literally just got done with my pump session and the first thing I think about doing is PMO. Just stay strong man, build that willpower muscle. If you have a girlfriend that's good motivation and you can ask her how your progress is over time since she's the one taking it, lmao. 

I've grown nearly half an inch in length in 2 months with just some light jelqing in a hot shower, and using the bathmate afterwards. The head of my penis has grown ever so slightly, but definitely noticable growth. I also reccomend using vitamin E oil for jelqing as that can help a little bit with recovery times. 

I just do 3, quick 5 minute sessions with the bathmate in the shower with hot water. When I put the bathmate on before a 5 minute session I do about 20 reps with jelqing, and I do a quick kegel before the initial jelqing movement, just for a quick squirt of blood for more blood flow. 

This was just a quick rundown of my routine. Hope this is some good info for your bathmate journey. Take it slow brother. Peace. Remember, stay PMO free."
NoFap,ffug3oy,t3_ev0zsr,1580241227.0,"The bathmate tends to get me a little horny afterwards. If you can abstain from PMO after using your pump, and if you are careful and consistent with it; I see no reason why you wouldn't give NoFap and Penile Exercises a go. 

If it worked for you bro, go for it. If you feel any pain, stop and decide what you want to do with PE in the future. 

Good luck, and happy gains.
