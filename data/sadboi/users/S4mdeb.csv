castlevania,fk22qlq,t1_fk0upxg,1583791903.0,I read something somewhere (I can’t remember exactly and don’t know the lore sorry) but it was that Lenore would act as the succubus in SotN and enter Alucards dream as his mom but then he kills her in the dream which leaves her soul to wander aimlessly for eternity. The way it’s set up though alucard is unlikely to go all the way to styria unless maybe he gets the castle to move again but idk it seemed interesting
