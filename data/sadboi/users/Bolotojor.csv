When it comes to the honor system, once a few people start abusing it, everyone else will be worse off. And since the system is non-cooperative, naturally, the only rational decision is to abuse the system too.

You CANNOT convince other players to stop, as you have no power over them.

So, yes, in a way you are ""forced"" to ""farm"" honor, since otherwise you will inevitably fall behind."

... which clearly implies otherwise.

> if I told you I need concrete help right now and for you to provide it, you wouldn't

You are absolutely right I wouldn't, because I wasn't trained to do so. It would be incredibly arrogant of me to pretend I can provide help beyond talking to you, lending a helping hand within my powers, i.e. financial support, and then trying to refer you to a professional, who is much more likely to provide you with effective help against suicidal thoughts or behavior.

Also, you are right in that I shouldn't have linked suicidal behavior with depression. Even though depressed people and people with mood disorders are much more likely to commit suicide, they do not account for every suicidal person. And addressing depression does not effectively reduce suicide rates, as far as I've gathered.

It is, though, interesting to observe how a person who is so acutely aware of all the logical fallacies and such then go ahead and use anecdotal experience, as if not knowing how bad it is as a basis to forming an opinion.

For example, you talking about getting professional help is so incredibly naive that I am seriously suspecting you have never received one or your were unlucky in finding a good therapist. What do you think, they just sit there and talk to you about life or something? It seems you've never heard of any psychotherapeutic techniques, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Dialectic Behavior Therapy, which both, for example, are proven to be efficient tools in reducing recurrence of suicidal behavior."
