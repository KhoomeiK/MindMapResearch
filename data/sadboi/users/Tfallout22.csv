BPD,fpxy6ug,t1_fpxxpm4,1588992011.0,"He wouldnt watch them or give any feedback just be silent. Thank you though for taking the time out of your day to help me. He tries and I see it and I see how patient he is with me but he's harsh at the same time and I cant deal with that. He came home for lunch and I was sitting silently in bed and he basically just brought up the whole thing again and was mad at me for laying down and being silent for once. And then I went off again. When I didnt give him a kiss, because I'm obviously in a mood, he left. Back to work."
BPD,fpxx0yp,t1_fpxw44o,1588991322.0,Telling me that diagnosing myself is wrong and that I need to go to a therapist but it took me a year to open up to him about my family and I cant even make it easier for me to explain myself to a therapist without knowing myself. I was on anxiety meds until I abused them and i havent been to my primary care doctor since not like she knew what was exactly wrong with me either she just gave me anxiety meds just because i said i was anxious and she believed me but I know I have more than that.
BPD,fpxwlue,t1_fpxw44o,1588991070.0,"Him and his sister told me to basically get over it and my paranoia is just something I have to deal with. I have to deal with it by myself. He wont talk to me about BPD, or anything. I played videos of a highly sensitive person and told him about my family and how I'm emotionally a mess because of them and my past and he says I'm taking my past out on him everytime. If I take it out on him it's because he's not listening so I make assumptions because I'm trying but I'm not going to a therapist so it's not good enough because I'm not talking to someone else when it took me a year to even open up about my family."

Sims4,fpxcana,t1_fpxc6mg,1588979850.0,The beds kinda break after a couple uses so if you dont repair it quick enough they might die by that and it falling on them or an accidental death when putting the bed down.

BPD,fpxb9yw,t3_gg3ggm,1588979270.0,I used to sad-post. Either because I had no one to talk to and felt like maybe someone would like or comment on whatever it was that I was posting but so many people would just ignore it so I just stopped because if they wanted to know how I was they wouldnt be consoling me on facebook they'd be in my face. But they weren't. They weren't even messaging me. So I stopped.
BPD,fpxauov,t3_gg3pc7,1588979030.0,Open up. Dont bottle yourself up. Dont explode and hurt yourself later it's so hard to open up even when we dont know or see each other. I wish I was able to give insight to everyone's posts or even ask for insight on myself. You're being brave just by talking about your struggles.
BPD,fpxa9xj,t1_fpx9wcv,1588978705.0,"I cant be a perfect little housewife. I cant do everything he wants me too all the time. Cook (I dont really have the focus/motivation/etc to cook or want to cook for myself), i only clean occasionally but I usually just let it pile on until I finally deal with it. I dont wear girly or cute clothing because I dont think I look good in anything. Even jeans and a baggy t shirt have me feeling insecure."
BPD,fpx9wcv,t3_gg3he5,1588978495.0,I feel the same way. My SO says I'm his ideal body type and the type he's attracted to but I'm definitely all the other things too. I dont think he understands how mental illness works and how no ones really happy or easy to deal with 100% of the time.
BPD,fpx99rf,t3_gg1uk3,1588978140.0,Something triggered you to do that because in that moment that's all you wanted to do. to let out the feelings that weren't being listened to. Let them out in way you know you wouldnt be ignored. You're not manipulating you're venting. Just not with words. If my words arent being listened to why should I say them? Talking over and over and saying the same thing over and over is very frustrating. I hate repeating myself. It's like I'm just listening to myself and being my own therapist (my own horrible therapist at that) because on the outside I'm screaming and on the inside I just want someone to understand why I'm like this and LISTEN to me without having to scream or yell.
BPD,fpx8n1q,t1_fpx7w1r,1588977788.0,I know this wasnt commented for me but I needed this too. Thank you.
