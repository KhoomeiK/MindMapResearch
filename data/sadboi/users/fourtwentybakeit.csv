Flowerpot is the most versatile, it really can do herb extracts or oils thanks to the dedicated components that are available with the V-Rod for instance.

I have used both portables from S&B and obviously the volcano over close to ten years, as well as numerous other vapes, more recently I tried a titanium omnivong and found it to be very disappointing. 

This vape seems to be extremely versatile, the build quality is easily up there with the best I've seen on any device, and compared to anything else the flavour is superior.

The mighty is better as a session vape shared between a few friends, but honestly, that is the only time that I personally would even consider using a mighty over my ghost.

The VOLCANO HYBRID Tube is not intended for use with the previous VOLCANO CLASSIC and VOLCANO DIGIT models.

This is due to the fact that the Tube inhalation method does not require the air pump to be switched on. The heating process and the air management of the VOLCANO HYBRID have been optimized to ensure that ingredients are dissolved during the first inhalation processes even without an air pump.

The VOLCANO HYBRID works with a patented combination of hot air convection heating and additional heat conduction. This means that the air is heated by the implemented heating block, as well as by the heated Filling Chamber, which is directly connected to the heating block.

In addition, the VOLCANO HYBRID has a modified Filling Chamber, which is screwed onto the device. This ensures a stable and smooth 360Â° rotation of the Tube. The VOLCANO HYBRID Filling Chamber is not compatible with the predecessor models due to its changed composition. Technically, the VOLCANO HYBRID Tube could be mounted on the EASY VALVE Filling Chamber, but since neither the VOLCANO CLASSIC nor the VOLCANO DIGIT are equipped with the additional heat conduction that warms up the Filling Chamber (as well as that the use of the air pump with the Tube is not intended) the envisioned performance cannot be fully achieved.

Â The EASY VALVE Filling Chamber is also not designed for use with the Tube, as it cannot be screwed onto the device and therefore cannot be securely attached to the device."

I've been very careful to direct the torch at the same point on the cap whilst rotating using the spinning mouthpiece, working my way away from the tip with each cycle, allowing the device to click between cycles properly.

I feel like the product doesn't deliver the same buzz that the hype did. As a medicinal user, the absolute best I've used is the ghost mv1 hands down, but it's quite an expensive purchase. As a butane powered device I think the vapman is a much better product.

Because I have a number of different vapes available, I like to mix it up as much as possible though, and I tend to use different vapes for different things.

I honestly think that the Dynavap craze is mostly down to good marketing, because the product really isn't that great.  They have successfully targeted the fringe smokers who are trying to break their habit and switch to vaping.

I was really looking forward to being blown away by the performance of the Dynavap, and initially I thought it could be the thing that I've been looking for.

However on the second day it became apparent that this device was little more than an overhyped fad. I ran out of gas before I was able to get high, which made matters even worse for me. This was a sign of things to come, as even with carrying two different torch lighters, I was still unable to medicate without running out of gas.

I ended up having to rip 2-3 bowls to get the same effect that I would typically get from any of my other battery powered vaporisers. This resulted in the whole of the roof of my mouth becoming sore and even burnt in places.

I have tried to use it on a number of occasions since, because I really wanted to give it a fair chance, but it is just not up to the job. Less than two weeks after it's arrival, it is going to be posted on eBay as it is basically trash as far as I'm concerned."

Depending on what kind of user you are, you can get optimal extraction by doing a session starting on a low temperature and slowly increasing it as time goes on.

Save all of your AVB - waste product (Already Vaped Bud) and search any good sub for edible ideas. I make brownies and flapjacks with mine.

If you get your stem *REALLY* dirty, you can put it in a pan of milk and cook it for about 10-12 mins to get a perfectly clean pipe and a really potent edible drink. Just pour it through a coffee filter to get rid of any plant material.

Try to really drain the battery before charging and let it charge fully before using it again. Can't stress this enough for prolonging the life of your battery. Also avoid pass-thru charging as this is also really detrimental to the life of the battery.

Other than those things, you've got yourself a solid vape that will still be working in years to come. My OG Solo has only recently given up and I've had it since 2011!"
