mentalhealth,fgk9vsz,t3_eyzhib,1580860660.0,"You may have anxiety and depression. It might be beneficial to see a psychiatrist, once I got on meds I felt way better. Don't feel bad about being sad or scared it's really common. Your grades will improve once you feel better. Also SAM-e might help too, it's avail at Whole Foods if you're in the US. Also lemon balm tea or tincture may help you naturally chill. Make honey tea if you get lemon balm tincture bc it's quite gross tasting on its own. I hope you feel better. It may be a bit of a process but things will improve, you'll feel better. Simply being aware of how you feel is the first part of the solution. I am a bit of an introvert and didn't have a lot of friends in school either. You sound cool, own that. You're a good person. You have value. Sending positive vibes your way. Hang in there like the kitty in the poster. Take care, it does get better. Things will change, life has ups and downs; you may just be in a bit of a down. Later tater ;-)"
