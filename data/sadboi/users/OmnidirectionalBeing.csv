She was indoor/outdoor until the last two years of her life, was born the runt of the litter with a heart murmur and out lasted the entire kit by nearly a decade in some cases best I can tell (we only adopted her and one other).

I would sleep with her, wake up with her, and kiss her good night every chance I got. The last five years she lived with my elderly parents as I had a career that demanded a lot of odd hours and travel. She loved me just as much and I could tell. She would always come and sit with me, even when she couldn’t jump up on the couch anymore. I loved her more than some of my family, no lie. 

Don’t ever let someone shame you for it not being masculine or something. That’s all bullshit. Absolutely show love and compassion for anyone that matters to you. Always."
