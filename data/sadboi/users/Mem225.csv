funny,ffu32rl,t1_ffrcrw3,1580233437.0,Interested in reading this!!!!
funny,ffu24la,t1_ffrk9xv,1580232854.0,I was thinking this!!!
Anxiety,falhefj,t3_e9mo41,1576184403.0,"I started back to work after being off the last seven years (waited for my youngest child to start school) and I'm totally drained. I am in anti social mode, since before starting working.  The constant interaction is overwhelming and draining."
AskReddit,fai0u2y,t3_e9crr1,1576097514.0,Not meeting families expectations and the stress of planning... Where are we going? How long will we be there? Will we need an extra gift? Oh hes bringing his new girlfriend? Which child is going to have a meltdown? But we're already having 2 dinners!!!
depression,fa8syjk,t1_fa78awh,1575853962.0,Most people don't. I have a good friend who totally gets it. But to everyone else I'm the jerk who disappears for a while.
depression,fa5o3s7,t3_e7nfx1,1575816908.0,Yes. I feel like that now. Its nothing anyone did. I just feel out of place. Its with everyone. I also have a tendency to withdraw socially when this happens.
depression,f879y99,t1_f8762oh,1574322374.0,"It's really difficult. Especially, when you have a great day and know the crash is coming but there is little you can do to change it. Self awareness is the first step, but it can be a double edge sword."
depression,f85mml6,t1_f85ljwr,1574278479.0,Find a reason to hold on. Feel free to contact me if you think it may help. I wish I could give you some hope. Please dont give up.
depression,f85kyna,t1_f85klmk,1574277475.0,Ooh.. You're still young. The teen years are the worst. Once you get past them things look up. And the sooner you get healthy coping skills the better. I waited until my 30s to accept that I needed professional help. Life would look much different for me if I did it earlier.
depression,f85k0vj,t1_f85jq4d,1574276898.0,Fair enough. Are you doing well in University?
depression,f85jgde,t1_f85j2by,1574276543.0,"As you get older you become more aware of how youre feeling and that some coping mechanisms arent healthy. Ive learned to be mostly open with my latest therapist. Shes not bad, but not my favorite. I suggest you find someone to sort out your head with you. 5 weeks, if you dont jive, find someone else."
me_irl,f85ieh2,t3_dz2zu0,1574275912.0,"What is ""quickest way to an anxiety attack?"""
depression,f85ey3f,t1_f85e92z,1574273797.0,"I've been to 5 in my life. Im still deciding if i like my current lady. Keep trying. Also, that first therapist sounds like an idiot."
depression,f85cn8u,t1_f85brcw,1574272416.0,"Do you see a therapist? Or at very least someone to share the ""screwed up"" thoughts without judgment? 

Plans, huh?? Maybe put your focus elsewhere? I dont mean it in a snarky way. For me one thing that helps is trying to alter my thought processes. Focus on how to move forward, rather than finding a way out. 

Youll have good and bad times. Heck, i say this as I cant find any motivation to leave my bed."
depression,f85bgau,t1_f85aj7d,1574271702.0,"I used to cry and cry when I planned them out. I couldnt leave just one. Sometimes it would make me feel calm.

Did you ever write it? I have, but then I kept going. Like free writing. After a long while, I had a few reasons to continue. 

I dont know your experiences, nor Feelings, but if you ever need someone to scream to, cry to, or just  distract you, reach out...Im usually available"
depression,f85al8n,t3_dz1kju,1574271176.0,"Do it. All of it. No matter how silly they tell you it is. 

My biggest regrets are doing what I was ""supposed"" to do."
depression,f85acl1,t1_f858z7c,1574271026.0,*hugs* I've felt this way before.
depression,f7ytt9s,t1_f7yt59w,1574100612.0,"Probably not. The 2 places I have dealt with made me wait 3 weeks.  But I'm not sure how things run in your area. Also, the lady I see isnt able to prescribe. I have to see a doctor they have on staff based on what my therapists notes say."
Anxiety,f7yr22d,t3_dy6hb6,1574099447.0,"Yay!! You're taking steps to be better and right your wrongs. It wont be easy, but moving forward isnt always. Best wishes."
depression,f7yqegi,t3_dy64yo,1574099172.0,"I go up and down. And have little control over it. I found I can get the balanced feeling to last longer if I put in the work. Meaning, whatever you did to climb out of your low, keep doing it. I cant promise it will work, but it's worth a try."
depression,f7ypw64,t1_f7xyl7c,1574098952.0,"This hits home. The why!! I have been beating myself up over how I can feel like this when everything is going right. My anxiety is finally under control, but my depression is spiraling. I cant even cry on my newer meds. I dont have the answers, but I'm right there with you."
depression,f7yoxjv,t3_dy5ftd,1574098529.0,"The first appointment, in my experience, is getting your history. ""When did you start feeling this way?"" Medical history, drug/alcohol history, whatbit was like growing up.... I dont like the first few weeks of a new therapist. It takes a while to get comfortable, for me anyway. It took me a very long time to make my first appointment, but almost 2 years in and it was the best thing I could have done for myself.

It'll take a while to get a diagnosis. There were things I didnt share in the beginning and later on confessed to."
depression,f7yo33l,t3_dy35qn,1574098158.0,"I keep saying ""I want to go home."" But I dont know where that is or what it means.  I want to go back to times when I was mostly carefree and had long term goals. Now I just live day by day. I'm in a period of what I call low energy (fatigued, negative self talk, loss of interests, lack of focus, zero appetite...)"
depression,f7ylezo,t3_dxy6yw,1574097024.0,"I ended up dropping out. I made it 3 semesters. I ended up failing out as my parents refused to allow me to come back home. I was away for college. 14 years later, a degree would be nice, but having a handle on my mental health would be better."
depression,f7yjbii,t3_dy0vc8,1574096120.0,Yes!!!! My family doesnt understand how I can sleep all day and all night. My low energy times are awful.
