BreakUps,fdwrfcv,t3_en5efd,1578761614.0,Take some time to think about how you really feel. Then reply with honesty.  It's never wrong to tell the other person how you really feel rather than play some kind of games.
BreakUps,fdqzpe2,t3_emu022,1578677512.0,"It's never wrong to tell the other person how you feel. No contact is more like a time to figure out how you feel without distraction from the other person, at least for me. It is hard. Don't blame yourself. It's gonna get better."
BreakUps,fdqtjea,t3_emsx4i,1578674564.0,Love is a strange thing...I still don't know how I feel after going through a similar situation.
BreakUps,fdnpqhk,t3_emaygg,1578590549.0,I understand he has reasons. The problem is that it hurts so much when I realised he decided to make a promise to another woman rather than to me. That hurts so so bad.
EatingDisorders,fdjquhg,t3_elr3zg,1578483994.0,"I think I know how you feel.
I've never been overweight, but for some reasons my mom always makes fun of my weight and tells me how unattractive I am with current weight. She also made it like a competition and plays the victim etc.
Stay strong. DM me if that helps x"

BreakUps,fdgvldr,t3_el1og0,1578409421.0,Been nauseous and sick when I think about him...can barely eat anything.
BreakUps,fde8z73,t3_ekxk9r,1578333800.0,Sometimes during the day I thought I'm over him and am okay again...then at nights when I'm alone by myself...I just wish to fall asleep so I can see him in my dreams and re live those beautiful moments even if it's fake. But then I  feel so scared that I would wake up only to realise he left me. Forever.
