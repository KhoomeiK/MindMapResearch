BipolarReddit,ey5d2r2,t3_cvhqxk,1566828594.0,"Same. 

It took *years* of SSRI's (cap @ 120mg Prozac) to realize it was doing me no favors. After weaning down/finding a psychiatrist,  I noticed my mood  stabilized and my anxiety was not as intense. Currently on 200mg Lamictal, def feel its positive effects. 

Really wish I knew this information about 20 years ago. Whomp Whomp. Life sucks."

New girl (nice first day impression) walks by telling a story about some girl screaming her ass off b/c ""she was totally bipolar"". I was immediately wtf. Why are you acting like you've been here a whole year rather than 1 fucking day?? My advice is to hold your tongue **but** if he brings it up again **\*try\*** and not choke him out. Good luck!"
