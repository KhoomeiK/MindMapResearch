depression,es8j3x1,t3_c67qfk,1561699799.0,"Its a blessing that you have a sister. She looks up to you as a role model. Even though things are horrible and depression is truly crippling, the inspiration you're to her should be an immense motivation for you. 

Strive to be the best older sister you can, even when times are rough. That way you can always find happiness in the growth/ prosperity you have helped your sister achieve. 

I have a younger brother. We are not the closest and in all honesty have a pretty strained relationship... it pains me even more to know I am the direct cause of this. I have made it my goal to improve our relationship and become closer. I wish that someday I can have the same relationship you have with your younger sibling. 

I wish my brother could realize that regardless of how awful a person I am, I love him more than anything in this world and wish I could be just as amazing as him. 

I wish you all the best. 

Much love."
depression,es8im1q,t3_c68e1n,1561699264.0,"I feel this way sometimes but what helps me is that I always tell myself everyone has a purpose. Regardless of how hard things may be sometimes for all us, we all serve a purpose. I am not even talking from a religious standpoint. 

For example, every time I hold the door open for someone, I like to think I made their day a little better or even just made them feel noticed. Who knows... maybe that simple act of kindness just helped save someone's life. 

I know people may think its silly but the thought of making someone else happy brings me some peace of mind. 

If I cant be happy, I figure the least I can do is make someone else happy and bring a little glimmer of hope into this world. Doing one random act of kindness may even help you get through the struggle of your day. 

I wish you all the best and if you ever need someone to talk to please don't hesitate to message me. Sometimes a simple conversation can make all the difference. 

Much love."
depression,es8i48c,t3_c6e5f6,1561698743.0,Damn bro that is fucking rough. What a broken/ disgusting system. I hope you find the help you need. Please message me if you ever need someone to talk to. Much love and I hope you find the peace you need.

Seeing people around me doing things with their lives makes me feel like I am simply a failure/have no future. Whenever I find something that I enjoy, the motivation and fun is usually gone within a day. Your mention of lack of focus I think is something we all experience. Just know you're not the only one feeling this way and this sub offers great support. For me at least. All the best to you and much love."
Screenwriting,es8hhpl,t1_es7m1h8,1561698103.0,"This is a great point. I would also argue that Halo 5 Guardians would have a decent script as the campaign is quite theatrical. I know it isn‚Äôt the best Halo game but i feel as though it has a decent/well thought out script. 

Halo 3 ODST also has an amazing storyline. However, I don‚Äôt know what the script would be like!"

depression,erwtfkl,t3_c4cbo4,1561355582.0,"I started feeling different when I turned 19 (I‚Äôm 22 now). Everyday i wish i could go back to how things were before all this shit. Ive hurt people I love deeply and have pushed so many people away because of it. Ill never be able to forgive myself for any of it. 

When my parents found out about my depression they had no idea what to do. Hell sometimes i feel like they tough I was being dramatic and it fucking sucked. But i‚Äôve come to understand that it is a very hard situation to be in as a parent. 

Giving my mom and dad a kiss everyday has not only helped me but i think it has had a positive impact on them too. Maybe tomorrow try giving them a big hug and reminding them how much you love them. Hopefully it will give you the same peace it brings me. Even if it is only momentary. 

Finding someone to talk to about depression isn‚Äôt easy. Please do not hesitate to PM me if you ever need to vent/talk. Fuck even if you just wanna shoot the shit and have a conversation. This sub has really helped me a lot with my shit and I would want nothing more then to help others. No one has to struggle alone. 

Much love my friend. Cheers to you."
depression,erwsd27,t3_c4h62b,1561354347.0,Your post really spoke to me. We so often forget that the little things in life can make the biggest difference.

depression,erwrlc7,t3_c4ezz9,1561353481.0,Yup! Everyone has different ways of dealing with their demons. In my opinion its totally fine and actually seems to help me at least.

Midsommar,ervhydj,t3_c4439t,1561316264.0,"I couldn‚Äôt agree with this more. I have been in so many arguments with people that claim Hereditary is a ‚Äúbad‚Äù movie. They simply cannot comprehend the masterpiece unfolding before their eyes. Horror cliches such as ‚Äújump scares‚Äù have ruined the genre. General audiences believe that a horror movie without jump scares is not good. What a damn shame. 

In my opinion, I believe time will benefit Hereditary. As the movie gets older, I feel as though more people will come to appreciate this breathtaking film. Kurbick‚Äôs The Shining experienced this as it was not well received initially. Yet now it can be understood as one of the most influential pieces of cinema history. 

In regards to Midsommar, I have no doubt that it will be another masterpiece. It will definitely have more mainstream appeal and thats okay! I hope it is a movie that everyone can appreciate, while still providing stellar cinematography and other staples of Aster‚Äôs work. If general audiences still cant enjoy it... fuck em."

movies,erody5l,t3_c2y41t,1561076415.0,Damn! I am so excited to hear about his production company. I truly feel Ari is one of the best directors/writers working right now and I am sure he has some exciting projects to bring to life. It does make me sad that after Midsommar it will be quite some time before we get another horror masterpiece from Ari. Living through this period of Aster and Peele films has been such an amazing experience.

depression,erkotw9,t3_c2fuf3,1560968132.0,My parents know about my depression but I still try to hide it from them the best I can. Sometimes I feel bad that they have to see me like this and other times I feel as though I am just some burden. Isolating myself in my room or other sections of the house seem to be what I have resorted to.
Midsommar,erkkpsz,t1_erjz1a9,1560965593.0,I just don‚Äôt want the comedic aspects to take away from the overall tone of the movie. I couldn‚Äôt imagine having ‚Äúfunny‚Äù dialogue in Hereditary. I feel as though it would distracting/take me away from the disturbing nature of Ari‚Äôs work.
Filmmakers,erkk0go,t3_c2hdn2,1560965157.0,This is simply amazing.
Midsommar,erjdsgr,t1_erjdpic,1560924948.0,Exactly. Hereditary is such a high standard to meet. But reading these early reactions makes me feel like this will be something special.
Midsommar,erjdii3,t3_c1tsxa,1560924617.0,Im in the same boat. Hereditary is my favourite movie of all time and I really hope Midsommar can compete for that title. Im sure it will be amazing though!!!
Midsommar,erjdf4c,t3_c2bkmr,1560924506.0,"Sounds like this is going to be the masterpiece we anticipated! Interesting that people are also saying it‚Äôs funny! I really didn‚Äôt  gather that while reading the script. Regardless, Ari is a brilliant filmmaker and I can‚Äôt wait to be blown away."
Filmmakers,eqtmbgm,t1_eqtgx72,1560314485.0,"Wow! First, thank you so much for taking the time to help me out. Your advice has been simply amazing! 

I really never thought of the importance of sound, as I have been so focused on cinematography. 

I will definitely try to do some volunteer work and look into local projects that I can work on for free. 

Again thank you so much for your time and advice. Cheers my friend."
