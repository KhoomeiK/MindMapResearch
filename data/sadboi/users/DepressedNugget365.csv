cats,fm2vib2,t3_fsqcdk,1585706377.0,Tortie! Torties are so sweet! I have one myself! Congrats 🥰
childfree,flvge09,t3_frezdy,1585523241.0,Is online therapy an option for you? An actual online therapist I mean lol. Definitely not a bad idea!
childfree,flvfb4e,t3_frezdy,1585522596.0,"Have you considered fostering or doing some volunteering? Obviously there’s nothing wrong with being child free, or not liking kids, but there’s nothing wrong with how you’re feeling either. It’s all valid 👍"
PCOS,flu8j4i,t3_fr09j0,1585497516.0,I haven’t had issues yet I think..but after being told the 3 year thing I was curious how likely it was so I could start watching for signs. Thanks!
PCOS,flu8eu6,t1_flu5xf9,1585497445.0,"Nah, birth control pills or some other form of hormonal birth control are usually options too. It’s the only one that works for me because I don’t want an IUD or implant. Progesterone just happened to not work for me for one reason or another. Though pregnancy is  possible on progesterone, so there’s that. 😅"
PCOS,fltz3n9,t1_fltym3b,1585491371.0,"They’ve tried putting me on progesterone only pills twice, but I always end up bleeding before I’m done with the pill part of the cycle, but that’s just me. Make sure you get a CBC to check for anemia if the bleeding is especially heavy too."
depression_help,flt5spq,t3_fqwabh,1585460172.0,"I don’t really have any advice, other than find someone to talk with, or an activity to clear your mind.  but I legitimately know what you’re going through. You’re not alone."
PCOS,flt5eb4,t1_fl7bmhw,1585459808.0,"Agreed, though I didn’t know about the authorization thing. I got lucky and put on ER immediately. Different doctor tried to force me in to Instant at a higher dose and I had GI distress so bad I missed 2 days of work after 3 weeks. Good luck!"
PCOS,flt52oi,t1_flhrix0,1585459504.0,You’re getting a hysterectomy? How old are you if you don’t mind me asking? Ngl for myself I wish I had the option...I’ve somehow got my bleeding under control on junel(according to my NP it’s like the lightest dosage pill) but I’m so sick of dealing and I don’t plan to birth at all..plus elevated cancer risks and loss risks.
PCOS,flt4v7y,t3_foiz8e,1585459317.0,Extended periods were what sent me to the dr. I had normal periods for 7 years then didn’t have one for a year out of nowhere. Skipped around for a bit and then went back to normal for awhile. Then I started bleeding for over a month. Not the only experience I’ve had with extended periods either. Definitely get checked out.
PCOS,flt4k0t,t1_flt4fvt,1585459042.0,Holy crap. Well that’s good to know I guess? XD the person that told me was a nurse of 30+ years.
PCOS,flt4hil,t3_fpxufg,1585458982.0,"Been there. My PCP diagnosed me and then the gyno he sent me to said I didn’t bc I didn’t have cysts, despite multiple other symptoms.(I probably didn’t have cysts at the time because I had stopped my birth control before that appointment). Next dr found 5 cysts, one needing surgical removal, next doctor said I shouldn’t have had surgery bc the cyst “wasn’t big enough”(even though the doc that did the surgery said it would never have gone away with hormones and could have turned cancerous). Point being PCOS is complicated and doctors are heavily uneducated on it. Don’t give up <3"
PCOS,flt3zj2,t1_flnkwko,1585458545.0,"Hope I’m not asking something too personal, but Did you have nausea and bowel problems when you first started it? My body did not like the instant release when I tried to switch.."
PCOS,flt3v60,t3_fpxx44,1585458440.0,"Usually it’s prescribed to be taken with meals. I’ve been on 1500mg ER for 3 years. It definitely helps to eat! Also if you’re in instant release and start noticing GI symptoms, believe it’s common with the instant. Just a warning. My old dr tried switching mine after 2 years and adding 500mg and I got super sick 3 weeks later. Not necessarily true for everyone, but a verifiable side effect."
PCOS,flt3i1s,t3_fpxz6w,1585458129.0,Happened to my mother in law all the way till she finally hit menopause. She’d get super sick too.
bisexual,floylxy,t3_fq4ktn,1585348125.0,"Of all the things I need a therapist for, I can say I did not consider bringing this up! That’s actually helpful. Thank you 🥰"
bisexual,flos45m,t1_flopb5b,1585344353.0,"That’s how a lot of it started. It started as a crush because I was getting more attention from this friend than him. But we’ve worked out a lot over the years and now that I’m actually out to him as bi(long story, came out in December and everything is Gucci) as well as our relationship is stronger in every aspect. So now that crush has turned more in to “damn I just wanna kiss a girl sometimes and get it out of my system” now that I’m comfortably out. Idk how to get that out of my system without major repercussions.  As to that last part..I may have lied when I came out to protect his feelings because I have no intention of acting on them. It’s just a constant itch that I want to scratch, but if I do, it’ll just open up wounds. I’m looking for a way to heal that without taking that route."
bisexual,floncu6,t1_flom420,1585341654.0,"It absolutely is incompatible..that’s why I want to squash the desire. He’s entirely opposed to it. Which knowing what I know about him, is entirely acceptable beyond “just not my thing”. It doesn’t help that there’s a specific person in mind, but even if he was interested, she’s not interested in poly relationships either. So I’m pretty much just suffering. It’s not even entirely a relationship I’m seeking, more so just..casual affection I guess? Not even full blown sexual. But the incompatibility is why I’m trying to figure out how to end the desires(without turning to alcoholism or other self destructive methods)"
bisexual,flohbgn,t3_fpqvui,1585338307.0,I know they didn’t do the best job of representation but Korra and Asami from Legend of Korra! Both strong characters in their own way and also bi!
bisexual,floh30a,t3_fps87e,1585338176.0,Ok but what about plus size flannels? I’ve never been so comfortable with a look till I started wearing them but I’m plus size and Torrid is too expensive.
bisexual,flog2ag,t1_flob52k,1585337614.0,"Oof I had zero intention of meaning those things to be bad! My apologies. I listed them because they’re assumptions I’ve come across, specifically from straights™. I only have issue with people that would /assume/ those things of a bi person 😅"
bisexual,flo2fi9,t3_fq10bn,1585330373.0,"That we don’t exist, that it’s a phase, we’re more likely to cheat, we only want threesomes/poly relationships, we’re hypersexual, we’re only claiming bi bc we want to “make the other side happy”(straights vs gays)"
relationship_advice,flmmoxx,t3_fpr7ct,1585288484.0,"Throw the whole gf away. Threats and manipulation don’t lead to healthy changes. Even if you stuck it out AND managed to better your health by her standards, what else could happen in the future? Being a douche bag is never good for someone trying to better themselves. Also, even though you “could be doing more”, every little thing you’re doing is a step forward and should be followed with encouragement."
SuicideWatch,flmm2ch,t3_fpraux,1585287879.0,"What’s left? Stick around and find out. Things can only get better. It’s really difficult to manage what you’re going through, I totally feel you. But You’re not alone. And that’s not to invalidate your feelings at all. Shit really blows sometimes, and a lot of the time a bunch blows up at once. But in the long run it’s worth it not to give up. I have to remind myself of that every day. But it’s so so true. Much love to you, friend 💜"
SuicideWatch,flfvd2z,t3_f9d5go,1585119244.0,Absolute mood. It’s bullshit. Why does shit have to be so complicated?
