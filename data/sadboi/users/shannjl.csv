alcoholicsanonymous,fl94smk,t3_fne6zf,1584941016.0,I grew up with an alcoholic parent and then became one. The best thing you can do is to lift yourself up as much as possible. Be around good healthy people. Find ways to laugh. Workout. Attend al anon. Do all that you can to counterbalance this disease of sickness in your house. Maybe consider developing a plan to move out because you can‚Äôt stay functional in dysfunction. And more than anything stop blaming yourself for any of it. You had zero control in this. She‚Äôs killing herself slowly because she‚Äôs in pain but you cannot make her want to get better. She will have to choose when she wants to live again. Not you.

The tinier changes help to create real change because you get a release of pleasure chemicals when you accomplish something so it creates a momentum. Once I get one thing incorporated into habit, I add another. I have a really terrible temper that no matter what still comes unleashed more often that I‚Äôd like. So instead of saying I won‚Äôt lose it, I‚Äôm only working on not saying the f word. Once I master that I‚Äôll chip away at another tiny piece of those fits.

It‚Äôll go around forever. I‚Äôm not saying any of this out of disrespect. I have been you.

SuicideWatch,fjizp03,t3_fdlq8w,1583379559.0,"I could be 100% off on this but is it possible this is an auto immune disorder? Auto immune includes lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, eczema, chrons disease, ulcerative colitis, neurological disorders... basically your body attacking and killing itself like it‚Äôs an enemy. It can take YEARS to find this out and get the right diagnosis. 

The two biggest causes for inflammation in the body (auto immune response) are gluten (bread and pastas have huge amounts) and dairy. I wonder if cutting those out will stop and eventually reverse what‚Äôs happening to your body? Another link to these diseases is trauma. Your body is smart. When you tell it you hate it over and over again, it begins to see it as something to destroy. Changing your self talk is bigger than we recognize. 

Whatever is going on, I hope you develop hope and I will be thinking of you friend. You deserve a life worth living."

It was beyond a miserable existence. As a last ditch effort I agreed to try low dose lithium (150-300mg) because no other meds really helped. Within 4 days the suicidal thoughts were GONE. I don‚Äôt mean felt better, I mean gone. I suddenly couldn‚Äôt get access to that line of thinking, why I would do that. Fast forward almost 6 months on it with a low dose of antidepressant to help with other things like social anxiety, lack of motivation, irritability, general feeling of being thin skinned, and I am in a completely different spot. I‚Äôm saying all of this because now that I‚Äôm out the other side of it, I know that depression lies. It told me I was disgusting, unlovable, a monster (rage issues also related to depression), and was short changed in this life and could never be happy. I‚Äôm half way through my life and depression told me it was too late. None of this is true. I am sorry you are suffering. Truly.

To get motivated I‚Äôll do the timer trick‚Äî set a 5 min timer and see how much I can get cleaned in that time. Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to just get me up and going. I also found a good support group that lifts me up once a week. Found mine through a church but I tried 12 step groups and liked those too. Connecting with people in a real and raw way helps me to not become apathetic and depressed.
BPD,fj8pw8m,t3_fc52v6,1583119215.0,"Yes. I have noticed my enduring pattern in life is that I have to stay busy and have to stay connected.

Pinterest is always good for ideas. Build the basics and then you can add some extra fun pieces later. Also find out if you‚Äôre a warm or cool tone so you‚Äôre getting the right colors.

SingleParents,fiwdrk1,t3_fa5qzc,1582782327.0,"Could she be repeating what she‚Äôs heard you or someone else say? I found my son will do that. Like getting out of the car once home from work/school, he gets an attitude and grabs his head and goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a very stressful day ok. I can‚Äôt deal with this drama right now.‚Äù  Straight outta my mouth. I really have to watch my words. My niece age 4 picked up my sister and I complaining about losing weight once and started calling herself fat. They‚Äôre sponges. They mimic what we say and do and how we deal with life because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre supposed to do. If that‚Äôs this case, you can have a talk with her and let her know that you don‚Äôt hate your life, are just worried right now but it will all work out, and that you are going to find another way to express your frustration. Seriously, they listen to that too and it helps them to develop emotional intelligence. 

Ps - glad you left the abuser. Had my mom left my dad sooner (she also tried to do the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing by staying over 10 years), I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd struggle as much as I do today with moodiness, anger and irritability, broken relationships, bad self esteem, past addictions, repeating the family pattern of finding someone to abuse and abandon you, and so much more. You absolutely made the right decision."
offmychest,fiv3f6h,t3_f9mwsz,1582753114.0,"I had a similar decent turn of events. Spent over a month knowing I was losing my job for political reasons only to get a better job, almost 20k more a year. Unpopular opinion but needs to be said: I had loads of people praying for me and relied on God heavily. Sometimes the biggest let downs lead to better outcomes. You just never know. Lesson for me was to chill out and realize that we‚Äôre not really in control. That‚Äôs all an illusion."
BPD,fiv2pr4,t1_fiupell,1582752748.0,"I am the same age and I‚Äôve often felt this exact same way. But since we do only have this one life, why not try to make it better no matter what the age? Hanging on to regret and past mistakes is breeding ground for misery. It‚Äôs easy to stay there but for me it really almost took me to suicide, thinking I‚Äôd messed up and was too old to ever have a life I‚Äôd want. Years of feeling that way. And finally 2 years of planning my suicide to tie up loose ends so I wouldn‚Äôt harm others. Looking back I feel sorry for that person. She was so sad for so long and most of it had to do with regret and angst over who I thought I should have been. Gotta leave that behind. It will ruin the rest of your life. You still have a lot to live and it can be good from here on out. DBT concepts (using them) are gold. I frequently have terribly moody days but I‚Äôm catching my thoughts more before I find myself in that bottomless well of depression and self hate. I hope you can find peace.

Work on getting a handle on the depression even if it‚Äôs just adding 10 min walk a day, set a 5 min timer to clean up, small goals like that to get you back into routine and feeling somewhat accomplished. Then look at where you can connect to others. Church group? Support group? Book club? Something from MeetUp? These people don‚Äôt have to be your besties, it‚Äôs just a place to go and practice interaction and it could always lead you to connect to someone. I hope you can get a break from this misery long enough to start building a life you want.

I set timers on my phone at 7am when he‚Äôs up and 5pm when I‚Äôm off work to remind myself to be in the moment with him, no thinking of conflicts or work or bills or anything, just trying to get to know him as a person. We recently went snowboarding and that was pretty cool. It wasn‚Äôt just me on the sidelines at a practice, I got to actually have fun and I can see it turning into a shared hobby.

For now though, you need to hold your anger to really get away for good. Make a pros/cons list and I mean DETAIL every awful thing she did. Before reaching to call or text her (and program her name: Read Your List First), read it and you will think twice about reaching out. Eventually the distance helps you to gain even more perspective. This really worked for me. As emotional people, we want to erase the bad and are quick to forgive. But anger serves a purpose at times, to protect. You can forgive her later when you‚Äôre further detached emotionally."

I bet there‚Äôs a lot more. I grew up with a narcissist and the damage is lasting. TMS, antidepressants, a low dose of lithium to kick the suicidality, therapy all really helped. I can connect to others now and you heal through healthy relationships. It can undo a lot of it. I know your pain but I also know as someone almost 40 that it doesn‚Äôt have to be your forever.

They want to create fast emotional dependence rather than wait for a relationship to build naturally because they know they can‚Äôt keep someone around without them being emotionally tied and confused. My bet is that if you tell him this is too early to be moving this fast, he‚Äôll tell you he‚Äôs never felt this way before and feels so different with you and can‚Äôt help himself.

I‚Äôve also noticed the more time I‚Äôm alone, the more I am suspicious of others and the weirder I get. I‚Äôve joined a support group that is really helping and I moved to a different job where I‚Äôm not as isolated. I really liken it to how birds that are left alone for a long time get neurotic and pull out all of their own feathers and then are mean when they‚Äôre around other birds or people again. So we take a lot of maintenance and I‚Äôve accepted that‚Äôs just how it is. Thought stopping, seeking others not waiting for them to pursue me, being present when I‚Äôm talking to someone so I can actually hear what they‚Äôre saying, and as lame as it sounds- exercise to actually get the bad nervous energy out of my body. I know that I still have weird moments and interactions but if I dwell on them and beat myself up, I get more withdrawn and worse every time. You‚Äôre not alone on this, but you‚Äôre not doomed either. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Advice,fi68qq0,t3_ed1ace,1582183270.0,"Some people do report flu like symptoms after they first contract it, and then it‚Äôll go away because HIV hides in the part of your immune system that identifies it. So I would take it seriously and go see a doc about antiviral meds and follow up with testing over the course of the next year. My friend is a nurse and the myth that HIV/AIDS isn‚Äôt really around that much anymore is really untrue. The myth that everyone lives 30 years with it is also untrue, that seems to be more of the exception than the rule."
PlasticSurgery,fi66wlp,t3_f5zxrx,1582181166.0,Selena Gomez has chubby cheeks and I‚Äôd say you rank the same as her for looks. Please don‚Äôt ruin yourself. Maybe you‚Äôre bored and need to focus on a hobby? You‚Äôre seriously a very pretty person.
PlasticSurgery,fi66797,t1_fi41bdn,1582180414.0,I agree!!
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fi64xo4,t3_f6guli,1582179146.0,"I read a helpful anecdote on this. It‚Äôs that it can rain a couple of days in summer but the season is still summer. So you‚Äôve had some cloudy days, but you‚Äôre still in recovery season. 
Another analogy is to look at recovery like learning a skill like playing an instrument. If you stop practicing for a bit and get rusty, do you start back at zero? Sure you might need a refresher on things learned but you haven‚Äôt undone the progress already made. 
I think a relapse like this can be an eye opener. You now know you can‚Äôt sell drugs or even be around them without getting pulled down. That‚Äôs a big lesson that some people never grasp. Will you?"
UnsentLetters,fi62oh8,t1_fi4yfly,1582177038.0,I also think it might help them to read this. For their own healing. To see it from a bigger perspective.
stepparents,fi2tps1,t1_fi2s43k,1582088827.0,Yeah I guess it really doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre stonewalling as much as you‚Äôre in shock. I read it initially and thought from my world view that she must stone wall at this point. That‚Äôs how much we‚Äôre all just in our own heads. Or at least I am in mine. Best of luck! This doesn‚Äôt sound too far gone to fix.
confessions,fi2tdnk,t1_fe2visc,1582088542.0,So funny! But seriously you should watch the episode where she hires Caesar Milan the dog whisperer for Cartman with her.. see if anything resonates
stepparents,fi25ia9,t3_f5tw00,1582071935.0,"Sounds really uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt know what you do but I can offer how I feel as a parent when I feel overstepped (not that you have, been clearly that‚Äôs how she felt in the moment). I feel defensive, not just over my kid but over my bad parenting that lead them to X behavior. I feel like I‚Äôve failed and I feel like my kid sucks. All irrational things but those thoughts and feelings bubble up when I feel someone is being critical of my kids. It‚Äôs a strange automatic protectiveness that just appears and in my case, I think it comes up because I had a critical (step)parent who was really harsh on me. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs you or her, but that seems to be how she‚Äôs acting. But she can‚Äôt expect that you‚Äôd serve as a primary caregiver and not also be a disciplinarian. I agree with the other comments, find out why she was triggered by talking it out with her. Stone walling never helped any relationship though, not unless the goal is to punish the other person and eventually disconnect completely."
SuicideWatch,fhzpeek,t3_f5b3zy,1582006525.0,"That‚Äôs an insane load. You need help, but where? If you‚Äôre connected to a church, maybe reach out to the youth pastor to see if the kids can get some mentors or a big brother/big sister situation?"
BPD,fhznw22,t3_f5g1k1,1582005066.0,"I love my son and find joy and purpose in being his mom but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cut out for this, as a huge understatement. My problem is the mood swings and trying to temper my chronic unpredictable irritability. I‚Äôm almost always triggered by something and have an extremely hard time coming back down. I do my absolute best at humbling myself, apologizing, counseling, talking to him when things are mellow, reevaluating our routines and what I can do to cut triggers, making sure I get regular breaks... it‚Äôs never enough. I still lose it pretty regularly and then the guilt EATS ME ALIVE. I am just recently finding out I have this disorder. Had I known, more than likely I would not have become a mom. I try every day to be better than yesterday and most days I go to bed shaking my head at myself. And yet I can‚Äôt seem to be better in the moment. I know where you‚Äôre coming from. It‚Äôs a hard hard road that no one really understands or even wants to have compassion for because we‚Äôre the ones pitching fits like toddlers. It‚Äôs brutal. I wish so much I had anything else but this disorder."
breakingmom,fhzmza1,t3_f5i4up,1582004240.0,"I feel smothered just reading that. Wow.... I don‚Äôt know how you do it. I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs no other friendships or he would be wildly jealous and suspicious? Some people don‚Äôt mind being on an island with just their 1 person but I know I do. If you‚Äôre unhappy, I hate to agree with the ultimatums but I sorta don‚Äôt see another solution. He needs to get help, maybe meds, to combat whatever obsessive thoughts he has. Anyway all just to convey that this is not normal and would drive anyone crazy."
relationship_advice,fhwt04g,t3_f4zrth,1581928753.0,"Remember that he‚Äôs not in a balanced  state of mind as he‚Äôs saying these things to you. When he‚Äôs stabilized from meds, he might feel different. One of the tragedies of bipolar disorder is the wreckage in relationships. A break is a good thing so he can focus on getting well. But it might take longer than a week in all reality. See what you can do to take care of yourself right now."
relationship_advice,fhws1s9,t3_eo6dmf,1581927457.0,"Look up NAMI (national alliance on mental illness). They might have a local office and offer support groups for family. The people you meet there might especially be able to help navigate local resources. This is pretty serious and you‚Äôre going to need your own support through this. NAMI would be a good start. Glad you‚Äôre talking to his family. They need to be involved if possible. If you feel scared at any point, listen to your gut."

SuicideWatch,fhwn17n,t3_f4wkn5,1581921388.0,"I‚Äôve lost 2 people to suicide. One was my fianc√©. He wasn‚Äôt found for almost 3 days and had started to decompose pretty bad by then. There‚Äôs nothing at all beautiful about it. Nothing. The wreckage of it destroyed 2 families. I feel I‚Äôll never get past this some days and it‚Äôs been years. Like others said, you‚Äôre craving a release from the pain. But life, pain and all, is beautiful. Please seek help. The suicidal brain is not working right. I had my own suicide planned a year ago, really planned, and as a last ditch effort, I tried low dose lithium. Within 4 days I couldn‚Äôt feel that way anymore. Not as a zombie, but as a balanced person. That was the proof to me that suicidal brains are sick (not to mention all the research.) My point is you won‚Äôt feel this terrible forever but you do need to get help. I hope you will try."

amiugly,fhp97nl,t1_fhnmfvk,1581784553.0,"I get being self conscious of your nose but it‚Äôs what makes you unique. In general feedback in my life has been I‚Äôm a very attractive female and I have had boyfriends that were too chubby or had a big crooked nose... or hair receding early etc. It didn‚Äôt even matter. They had that ‚Äúthing‚Äù... a confidence, skills, and hobbies... I couldn‚Äôt have cared less about this flaw. If they were missing some flaws they might have been self consumed assholes. No thanks. Be real. Your outside is hot. Work on the inside. Work on developing hobbies and skills and the art of conversation. No matter how good you might be, you can be better. And dare I say work on your mind and spiritual side? These are the solid things that make someone stand apart. Not a cookie cutter nose. Boring!!"
TrueOffMyChest,fhp8c5k,t3_f44kdw,1581784132.0,Of course kids love store bought junk over homemade goodies! It‚Äôs marketed to make kids (anyone) want it without logic. You were just being a kid. Don‚Äôt make it an issue and stop feeling bad about this. What people want more than anything is time. Spend time with her. Laugh about the cookies.

BPD,fhof672,t3_f40lbj,1581753573.0,This overwhelming feeling that you‚Äôre never going to be ok will lessen. I can‚Äôt say when because I‚Äôve had pretty long episodes like that but they do break. They really do. Don‚Äôt let your disorder lie to you and tell you you‚Äôll only get worse and only be miserable and so locked inside your head. Reach out and get help through this. It‚Äôs too much to take on alone. I will be thinking of you.

lonely,fhoapxg,t3_f3uowk,1581747748.0,"I got myself a facial today and then took myself and son out to dinner. I chose to make it special and not feel sorry for myself. And I actually don‚Äôt. For the first valentines ever! They‚Äôve all sucked in the past because I gave it energy and believed I was left behind and should be with someone. Perspective is everything. I‚Äôm almost 40 and am just now learning how true it is. So anyone who had a shit day today, get up tomorrow and be nice yourself. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a grand gesture. Can be enjoying your coffee and watching how you talk to yourself. Don‚Äôt underestimate how powerful gratitude is. I set alarms twice a day to make 3 things I‚Äôm grateful for. Can be as small as : I‚Äôm not sick right now, I have food at home, etc. Noticing the small stuff is huge."
KindVoice,fho943o,t3_f43rpn,1581745880.0,"I was caught in this cycle pretty bad 3 years ago. I also felt that drinking was ironically saving my life as I was so suicidal. Problem is that it makes you more depressed and I learned recently that it does something to your mind that won‚Äôt let you receive joy from anything. It‚Äôs awful to be in that trap. 

Will your family really hate you? Or is it possible they might have compassion for you?  If you were my kid, I‚Äôd want to know so I could help you. You could focus on the depression part and leave out the coke. Sometimes people don‚Äôt need to know everything. 

If you don‚Äôt have their support, you need someone else. I would really check your resources. It‚Äôs lack of true good connection to others that causes addiction and it‚Äôs connection that gets us back out. 

You can recover from this, I promise. You just need some help to get there. Life will get better. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre hurting so much and so alone. Warmest kindest wishes from far away, 
A fellow addict (in recovery)"
BPD,fhk7xx2,t1_fhiz8em,1581671136.0,This is so tough when you‚Äôve been shut down so many times for being ‚Äúoutspoken.‚Äù I went from free to tip toeing and I don‚Äôt know how to get back to free or if I even should.

SingleParents,fhbgbou,t3_evc37h,1581441717.0,"Very irritating.

Those flippant comments can feel like a slap in the face. They have no clue and good for them, but really time to check how lucky you are!"
BPD,fhb98sh,t3_f27t2w,1581437493.0,"I feel this way too. The other thing I‚Äôve noticed that seems to be different between myself and others is that because I‚Äôm open and constantly trying to understand others and be understood, I get A LOT of criticism. Maybe people think it‚Äôs constructive but most of the time it‚Äôs not presented that way. So people making comments about my child, parenting advice when it wasn‚Äôt wanted or needed, comments about how I am and how I‚Äôm perceived, when I‚Äôm in the wrong.... I really don‚Äôt see other people get that much ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù... makes me wonder if I need to be more shut down and less open about my mistakes and shortcomings."
