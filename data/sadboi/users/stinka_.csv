Advice,fi2lihy,t3_f5t7u9,1582082576.0,"LSD is really safe just as long as he isn’t at risk of psychosis. It’s even safe to microdose multiple times a week, and more and more studies keep coming out showing it’s beneficial effects. If it triggers a psychotic break then he will need to stop, but if he does it responsibly I can’t see an issue. You can’t overdose on LSD or get liver failure unlike alcohol, and it’s not nuerotoxic. Don’t worry about it unless it starts effecting his work or relationships (which is very unlikely)."
