TrueOffMyChest,fqhn3ip,t3_giq85s,1589380362.0,"I agree with all of that, 110%. I understand the need to dress modestly in public so as not to draw the wrong kind of attention, having to apply the same dress codes at home can cause all the aforementioned problems, and besides, the home is the place where we can relax and unwind, so we should be able to dress comfortably. See, my stepmom wears a loose shirt or tanktop with no bra and pajama bottoms to be comfy around the house. On paper, that sounds attractive, but I'm not drawn to her sexually. But I wouldn't chalk it up as much of the guys developing a rape fantasy, but covering certain parts that, left hanging out, would make everyone else in the house uncomfortable, to say the least. That would be like me walking around the house with my cock out; that's not just something they'll gloss over. 

To cite Scripture, after Adam and Eve sinned, they were given loincloths to cover the areas between their legs, and Eve her chest. Those were the parts that caused them to realize they were naked after eating the forbidden fruit. Also, there's the dress codes for Leviticus and Deuteronomy that cite that, at the very least, a man should wear a loincloth. So such awkwardness and the taboo around nudity comes from that first sin.

So, long story short, yes, the heart of the problem is the problem of the heart. Lust is one of the hardest sins to struggle with, and I'll pray for your male family members that you live with. Keep your head up."

Goes to show that you don't need to tamper in other people's marriages, even if they are dysfunctional and abusive.
