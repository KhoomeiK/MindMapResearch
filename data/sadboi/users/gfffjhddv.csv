sex,fh2j41x,t3_f17bff,1581254663.0,"(F) So last night my boyfriend gave me an orgasm that was so intense, I have never felt anything like it, I even squirted which is something that I do not do often. It was amazing and I have no idea how it happened. The orgasm was so intense it felt like I was floating I felt it through my whole body, my eyes were uncontrollably rolling back and I couldn‚Äôt hold back any noise that came from me, my whole body started having spasms, I felt like the whole room was spinning and it didn‚Äôt last just a few minutes it felt like it went on for ages, it was very very enjoyable and it put me to sleep straight after, how do I ask him to do it again in I don‚Äôt know how he done it? He was doing the same things he does normally as he knows my body now, but last night was something else. He is most definitely the best I‚Äôve ever had!"
