About loops, it's not that I think they are inherently bad. It's just a stylistic choice that's not as appealing anymore. I grew up on hip-hop, it was my ""phase"" as an early teen.

People will always be sentimental about the music they grew up with. The memories and feelings they have from their childhood and teens are part of the foundation of who they are, and the music that comes with it is also part of that faundation.

Sometimes it can be hard to teach old dogs to sit.

First of all, the particular type of music you produce used to be a bigger part of my life than it is today, kind of outgrew it as a person, it's what happens with time, keep that in mind.

I think it's good in general, it stays true to it's theme. I also enjoy when there are chapters within songs, but i think both of them expressed the same story. I mean, the more downtempo part gives you the expression of more melancholy than it already is, life goes up and down.

I have a separate list called *beats* that covers this ""type"" of trip-hop and some pure hip-hop, all of it instrumental. It's quite a bit a work in progress still.

My main list(mostly downtempo) both grows and thins out over time. For example, I had one or two tracks from Chinese man on my list for probably a year before they got a bit worn out and put in my place holder, side by side list. This is where songs end up if they are a maybe or gets burned out. I listen to that list sometimes, and Chinese man might be added once again this way.

It will most likely also cut down on your food waste. A plus here is that you will save time to spend on more fun stuff if you plan well. I think the most valuble thing in my life is time, time well spent.

If you can't afford to have a car, it helps the enviroment even further. Busses and trains are viable in most areas if you get used to the timings that fit your work hours and free time activites. Even better, i guess, is using a bike or something similar, that also benefits your health.

Most of the things i own are second hand, like my clothes, furniture, and stuff. It's better for your pocketbook and the enviroment.

There are probably more good examples, nothing more comes to mind right now, but the general idea is living a minimal consumer life style. and use as little of earth's natural resources as you can."

BipolarReddit,fat24dn,t1_faowhee,1576333874.0,"I want to add that one of those weekly dosage boxes are amazing. Before I had it and missed my meds one night I was so unsure if I had taken them or not that I skipped them in fear of overdosing. 

My routine is that I have set alarms, and a rule that I take my meds emmidietly. And the evening alarm on Sunday is when I re-stock the box. I'm also one of those who always have a backpack with me, so it's always with me no matter what. Also, if some type of unplanned event happens where I end up not coming home for a couple of days, I always have some meds with me."
BipolarReddit,f92ew3b,t3_e31uj8,1575027746.0,"Side note, I am on my phone and I won't edit this in a while, so live withe the poor writing :]

I see a lot of people ""taking your side"". I mean no disrespect, and I totally see your point, and please take what I am about to say in a none negative and constructive way. Let us try and put ourselves in their seat, just so we can try and understand their actions. If we understand them, there might be a good chance that we can keep our cool and appreciate what they did as well, even though it might be frustrating.

First of all. You have family and relatives that care about you, this is the only possible reason they are even asking you this. Yes, they have no idea what they are talking about, but can you blame them? Bipolar disorder is an extremely complex illness, and I bet it has taken you a lot of work to understand it, even you, one of the people who are supposed to understand your illness the best, might think it's a mystery at times. We all know that even doctors with decades of studies and work behind their understanding, won't come close to someone who actually suffers from the disease. So how can we blame others like family and friends for not understanding? I try not to, I instead try to educate my family members the best I can, the better understanding they have, the better support I am able to receive from them.

Again, I understand your frustrations, and please don't take this in a negative way, but in a constructive one. I mean, who wants to get frustrated with other people in the first place? I think *understanding* and *acceptance* are two key-stones in my life, and the only way to achieve them is to practise, and what a perfect example when to.

I wish you the very best, and I hope you are able to twist people's concerns into love, no matter how stupid and ignorant they might be :)

Also, happy turkey day!"

The website opened for reading to anyone a few months ago though. It's not *too* hard to obtain a code, just talk to one of the mods, or post in one of the inv threads. I would have given you one, but your account is just 30d old so it's hard for me to tell if your a good guy or not.

Read the introduction blogg and learn what the website is about, then pm me and let me know what you think. I'll share one of my inv codes if tildes seems like something you would enjoy and like to be a part of :)"

Also, people who don't use the settings in their programs and application's don't usually install another web browser on their pc and or other devices in the first place."
privacytoolsIO,f7u7zlt,t1_f7to7rm,1574012461.0,"Just so you know, you are asking yourself that question, sorry just had to burn you :D

Oh and last time I checked Firefox had a few different engines to choose from out of the box, including the best one for privacy concernes which is DuckDuckGo. Now Google might be the one that's chosen after installation, but the list is just a couple of clicks away."

How about this. Lets just crate a thread? Think of a catchy welcoming headline, and be very clear with what type of thread it is. I mean, it doesn't have to be a weekly thread if there's no need. On Reddit everyone are content creators. You had a good idea that seems to be of interest so, create :)"
BipolarReddit,f7etzr8,t3_dvnp8c,1573665771.0,"How about a weekly recurring thread dedicated to this? A separate support group within *this sub*, rather than splitting up the community? Same could be done for the younger crowd.

Doing it this way would also let everyone, including the younger ones take part in the discussions by reading, it's important to think ahead and prepare yourself if you have the disorder imo.

I'd like to hear what the mod team has to say about this as well, since you guys would probably be the ones setting up these weekly threads.

**Edit**: Deleted a second suggestion realising it was a bad idea."

BipolarReddit,f779wvh,t3_duku2b,1573448263.0,"The number one thing I hate about bipolar disorder is the psycho-social consequences it has. I have lost almost every friend I ever had, and it becomes harder to trust other people and make new friends every time I loose another one. I embraced the loneliness a long time ago, in fact, the actual loneliness doesn't bother me much. I do still mourn the loss of many of my old friends still though, some of them which I lost over a decade ago.

Don't forget that relationships are hard to manage for everyone, with or without mental illness. People are weird, and it's hard to blame them, I'm  just as weird myself, so how can I?

PS. I hope the baby is doing ok xD"

Thing is, on rare occation someone follows me on Spotify, and when someone does, they probably have a similar tastes in music, so i follow them back and look through their public playlists. 

Not much longer then a couple of weeks ago your name popped up. It was a ton of fun shuffling through your lists on spotify, and the playlist that ended up staying on the side panel was *this* list.

I *really* appreciate the work you have put into all of your lists. I have spent a lot of time exploring music, and it can be hard to find *truly* new experiences and even harder as the years pass by. So thank you, and keep it up! :)"
BipolarReddit,f40mze8,t1_f40b00o,1571302492.0,"I heavily relate to this one, that sleep is better then life. 

Sounds like your in a quite deep depression right now. Try and remind yourself that it's the illness that makes you feel and act this way, it's easy to start looking for other reasons, and that usually ends up with you blaming yourself one way or another.

Your just human, we all carry the burdens of life, try and not be to hard on yourself.

And let your health care professionals know of the specific symptoms. This one that you describe right here is only present when I am at a -4 or -5 on a -5 to +5 scale."

I have taken a deep dive into these artists for 20 years :)

Hopefully your list reaches someone else in a bigger need though."
