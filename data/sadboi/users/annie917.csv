AskDocs,euxm9vq,t3_chsmzz,1564089144.0,"-Not a doc-

What type of thyroid tests did they run? Sometimes you need more than TSH labs to get the full picture.

You could try counting calories again and adding an extra day or two of exercise. Lots of veggies, not too much bread or pasta. Consult your doctor about the amount of calories that’s healthy for you. You’re only 18 so you don’t want to go to low or you’ll screw up your metabolism and growth. Try that for a month and see if you lose weight.

Are you taking any antidepressants? Sometimes those can cause weight gain.

What are you talking about it’s hard to know what really happened? The rotary is in the center of town and is highly visible. There are people constantly in the area.

I’m sorry for your wife’s experiences, but Steve didn’t do anything to her and I’m willing to bet if he ever met her he’d treat her with utmost respect, like he does with everyone he meets regardless of race. Sounds like you have some misplaced anger because of your past experiences with people in town and that is unfortunate.

Ultimately, I take issue with doxing a person who’s a blue collar worker who simply has an opinion. He doesn’t work in government, he doesn’t have a direct hand in law making, he’s just a simple guy with an opposite viewpoint who was exercising his 1st amendment right.

He doesn’t agree with illegal immigration. So what? That doesn’t make someone racist. He said his name and business because he doesn’t have a problem with people knowing his stance. Good for him.

As I mentioned, the town has largely supported him. He has helped the community a tremendous amount, helps numerous customers when they can’t pay their bills, drives customers to and from work when he’s working on their car, loans his personal vehicle to them, and donates to all of the local charities because he’s a GREAT guy. He also has a family who knows him to have a big heart and who would help *anyone* regardless of their race.

I’m sorry you are too obsessed with your political agenda to realize that he’s just a normal guy with an opinion that’s not unlike half the country.

/ˈbiɡət/
noun
a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions.

Based on that definition, looks like the protestors are the *real* bigots here.

You pass off your event as a “vigil” when it’s really to promote your political agenda, oppose ICE, and protest Trump. You’re free to protest in whichever peaceful way you see fit, but you act like babies when *anyone* has a difference of opinion.

You marched around that rotary trying to get attention and that’s exactly what you got. Most of the protestors were not from Pepperell, so I don’t expect them to know that Pepperell is a *conservative* small town, but FYI the town has supported Steve and his business because he has proven to be a solid member of this community for 40+ years. If you get to say your opinion, so does he. That’s how America works. The 1st Amendment doesn’t just apply to one side.

And if you ask other witnesses (who were not part of the protest), they’ll tell you a very different story. The protestors blocked him from being able to leave the rotary by surrounding him and then JD threw a lit fucking candle in his car! Most people would have yelled and acted angrily after that. A lit candle in a running car...are you serious? Do you even realize what could have happened? Over a difference of opinion. Wow. This is a real person with a family. Do you even realize that?

All of the protestors are also  commenting that the police “handled him”. Well did you know that the police told him these protestors have been causing issues in several towns around Mass and are just trouble makers? No, I’m sure you didn’t know that.

Also, do any of you even *think* about the fact that maybe Steve has a family who is now experiencing the backlash from HIM being doxxed? His family doesn’t even hold the same opinions and now has to deal with this bs just because he got a little riled up when there were protestors outside of his shop *all fucking day* when he’s just trying to earn an honest living. Welcome to small town Mass, where hot-headed Irish conservatives live and aren’t afraid to tell you how they feel. He barely uses Facebook and has never heard of Reddit. He couldn’t care less after this fiasco, all he sees is an increase in business and $$$$. His phone has been ringing off the hook from people thanking him for putting these crazies in their place. Pepperell is a peaceful country town and these people had to come ruin that, So congrats, I hope you got what you wanted out of this. He’ll be able to take a second vacation this year because of you.

Instead of picking on a small town blue collar worker, why don’t you pick on someone who is affecting real change? This guy was just expressing his opinion. Maybe in a way that you deemed “intimidating” but that’s life. He didn’t do anything crazy, you’re just demonizing someone for having a different point of view.
