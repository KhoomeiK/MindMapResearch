mentalhealth,fpq30ro,t3_gewxmu,1588814158.0,It isn't
Antipsychiatry,fnz5saj,t1_fnyegbd,1587386808.0,They don't always do good but also not harm. Different people work differently. It always depends on the person. But it is true that meds are bit overrated bc many ppl only take meds without therapy and some wonder why it didn't help.

mentalhealth,fn4nk48,t3_fzkhhe,1586645035.0,There are ppl like these but there are ppl with real issues. And you can never know what they had to go through and some ppl are more sensitive then others. It is best to support them. Even though they are faking some may not. There is even a mental disorder that is about faking any kind of illnesses.
unpopularopinion,fmztvlj,t3_fyeeay,1586529436.0,Tbh I'm getting bullied my whole life now. And it is kinda true but the boys in school emotionally hurt me  too so yeah. It depends on the bullies
mentalhealth,fmztcbo,t1_fmzt7gt,1586529125.0,Yeah but that was when I first got used to it. It kinda scared me.
mentalhealth,fmzt1id,t1_fmzswiq,1586528946.0,That's great to hear. At first when I got used to it I thought that I lost empathy. Which I don't really want.
mentalhealth,fmzpkgv,t1_fmyvwak,1586526767.0,You have kind heart. Didn't it affected you at the beginning and when there becomes more then it is much calm and easier? At least that was my experience
mentalhealth,fmxv2pc,t1_fmxo6g9,1586472442.0,PI know you can handle it but isn't it sometimes pretty intense? Bc I also have A LOT of ppl going to me if they need someone to talk to and some onf them tried to kill themselves and I thankfully could stop them. And few ppl who got raped and more. So isn't it pretty intense for you or am I the only one feeling this way?

mentalhealth,fmwe58w,t1_fmw5tdx,1586444938.0,Thanks but could you pls give me advice of what to do when your parents find out about the cutting? My mom found out and I donâ€˜t know what to do
mentalillness,fmwdvhi,t1_fmvz40b,1586444794.0,Ofc it wonâ€™t but you for yourself and try to not let yourself convinced. It may sound like much but you sure can do it
mentalillness,fmvy8pd,t1_fmuhp2g,1586434807.0,Then stop your thinking and get better
mentalhealth,fmude0v,t1_fmtyx3w,1586389200.0,That are definitely hallucinations. Get him help quick! A psychosis can develop.

mentalillness,fmuceft,t3_fxc76b,1586388653.0,Terrible bc I lost control and started cutting again
mentalillness,fmqeosy,t1_fmpdkgr,1586298190.0,Oh. That could actually be DID. But why do you reject them?

mentalillness,fmp1hob,t3_fwii3w,1586272609.0,I hear voices in my head insulting me. Everytime. And it is probably not DID. These are hallucinations. You probably also have voices in your head and they are not likely DID.
mentalhealth,fmoziux,t1_fmnh939,1586271541.0,Then maybe paranoia. Ask him if he hear or sees things
mentalhealth,fmmtw90,t3_fw8956,1586211997.0,I think she has schizophrenia bc it looks like she is having a psychosis. Pls get her a therapist. She really needs one
mentalillness,fmkdfzg,t3_fvsyi2,1586151347.0,No it isn't. Seeking help is the other option. And opening up. Not sucide
mentalhealth,fmkd1f9,t3_fvrs1y,1586150997.0,Don't we all? They already destroyed my life. You still can change that. Don't end up like me. Try to see every little positive thing. That's the most important one. And those A-holes shut them out of your life.
mentalhealth,fmidfd8,t3_fv5y5j,1586107375.0,"Yes. Bc I always behaved and did nothing wrong. In my school it is like a second life to me and at home my first life. And I never can really escape. Not in school bc of the bullying and home bc my parents sometimes just don't give a shit to my mental health and sometimes hit me if I do something wrong. I know this sounds selfish but I just need support and normally parents are the support but I can't get support from anyone or anywhere but my only true friend. I only have one true friend bc all my other ""friends"" are just fakes and used me, manipulated me and blackmailed me. I left scars that never seem to heal. They think I'm so ""mature"" but it is just the fear of doing something wrong and making wrong decisions. I feel like I can't do anything right. But maybe I am more mature just it isn't automatically. It is bc of my bad experience from everything. And I have my mental illnesses since elementary school. I only have a escape from all through social media. And my parents think I'm addicted to my phone but they don't even try to find out why. I hate every single thing about me and the world. Why can't I just get at least a little bit of happiness."
schizophrenia,fmfz9dc,t1_fmfr3bt,1586037966.0,I'm sorry. I also thought about something really weird idk why. That my soft toy that I got from my mom when I was little had something against me and hated me. Idk why but it was weird and I already had my anxiety disorders. I thought it was paranoia.

schizophrenia,fmfgrfy,t1_fmfg296,1586026908.0,I wait patiently just need to hold on tight. Now my mental illnesses is just killing me. I started self harm again after months of stopping. I fear that I can't stop it again. And I often feel numb and empty. That is bad bc I know that I won't care and might sucide but I still need to hold on. And now those voices are hating me too. I am happy that you are coping with your mental illness. I always put others first bc  it still isn't too late for them to have to suffer like me. And if they already are then I try my best to let them not feel alone or help. That is kinda the only thing I can be proud of myself. But I often doubt it. And overthink everything. Even now I jump from one bad thing to another.
