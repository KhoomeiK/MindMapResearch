news,fpoyyvb,t1_fpjuhz4,1588793074.0,"I am not sure what to look up to send you here that isn‚Äôt steeped in my own confirmation bias.  Standardized testing of American students has been lagging behind all other developed nations and from what I‚Äôve looked up we are stagnating or getting worse (depending on subject or who is interpreting the data). 

You aren‚Äôt looking through the lens of these types of test scores, though. You are looking at the number of people getting university degrees as a measure of intelligence and critical thinking ability. I don‚Äôt see a correlation there. It isn‚Äôt that I disagree that completing a bachelors‚Äô degree from a major university (in most cases) is a worthy pursuit and is meaningful. Yes, it does mean a person shows persistence and critical thinking. Depending on the program and marks, it could even mean the student may have learned a great deal and is ready to pursue additional studies at higher levels. 

However, that is based on the institution and the individual, not on the collective. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, mentioning university level education for our system wherein only the privileged (relatively few) are able to attend is unfair. There are plenty of other capable and intelligent people that would bring those numbers up to help your argument but can‚Äôt because our system is rigged against them. That and our society has created a necessity for college as a socioeconomic caste system. There are jobs you can‚Äôt get without a college degree that you really don‚Äôt need that 4 year experience (and debt) to execute. So let me step back from this and talk about the Flynn Effect. 

You are no doubt familiar with the Flynn effect. The fun (sarcasm) part about this was a June 2018 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. The study found that the Flynn effect and its reversal are both environmentally caused. Now, I hate IQ tests. They have become the phrenology of of the modern era in my opinion wherein a lot of racist people use IQ tests to justify a lot of racist shit they say and do. But IQ (as mentioned previously) is not a genetic thing and not tied to race exclusively - it is primarily tied to environmental factors. With that disclaimer aside, everything I have read states that the average American IQ is dropping and has been over the past decade. 

The reason is poor nutrition and lack of access to quality education. This is combined with the other Flynn effects of the lower educated having poor healthcare and more children (less access education and healthcare will do that).  So it matters not that people with money or people willing to go into debt that they will never pay off get to go to college. More and more people are becoming part of the lower class of poor or poverty. The wealth inequality gap is getting larger and full time employment is tied to healthcare. Education is only mandatory through high school but if you aren‚Äôt in a good neighborhood, you don‚Äôt have a school with a budget big enough to get a decent curriculum and your teachers can only do the best they can. Basically, you‚Äôre hosed. You will end up having more kids that will become part of the same system you are part of and no one is doing anything to make it better.  

I appreciate your perspective - but I left college 15 years ago with a degree in the chemistry. I watched 9/11 happen along with Enron while I was in college in 2001, I was working during the 2008 recession, I own my business during this current pandemic. No one is making all of the radical changes we need in our country.

news,fpd0x4w,t1_fpcfnwa,1588517445.0,"I appreciate your response. I will look it up. I worry about the GPA rising figure considering grade inflation and these ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù stories that came out recently. Also, the amount of university degrees increasing is a function of population increase. Unless you meant to include ‚Äúper capita‚Äù. I will look it up but either way, having a college education raises the ‚Äúeducation level‚Äù the same way a corporation can boost morale by adding another title in the progression of employee advancement without including a pay bump. Congratulations you worked hard and became a Junior Associate Director 2!  My overarching concern from my original post is less about the number of diploma mills in the country and the declining standards that lead to grade inflation but more of how I have perceived the younger generations are not being educated in a meaningful way. 

A person can get through primary and secondary education, get top 10% in some states (all states?) without a great deal of effort and automatically be accepted into a state school. Depending on what he or she studies at the state school, they may not have to work very hard (depending on the school, their own interests, course load, etc.). At the end of the college program, what they have learned is how to get a college degree. 

I am not judging these young people, of that is what they want to do, it is their choice and more power to them. But if their high school didn‚Äôt actually prepare them for much or challenge them, and they major in what comes easiest to them to get a bachelors degree, can we say that they are contributing to the education level in the country? Or, are they just checking some boxes that some adult told them they had to check in order to become an adult? 

As I said, I will look up the stats, but I think the foundation of your premise is flawed. 

1. Having high GPAs and more degrees doesn‚Äôt make Americans more ‚Äúeducated‚Äù if we define ‚Äúeducated‚Äù as smarter. When Americans are tested against our international peers, we fall woefully short and have for quite some time. 

2. Not every American who pursues higher education should. Our system is flawed and there should be alternatives to provide people a way to get people the education they need for the jobs they want and those jobs should provide them a living wage. A college degree should not be a measuring stick of how smart a country is. 

3. And here is what is most important - not everyone who should go to college is able to go. College is expensive. There are classes of people who are smart and hard working and poor. They will never have an opportunity to pull themselves out of poverty because our system of checking the boxes requires degrees that have become all but meaningless. These young people do raise the national average in test scores but don‚Äôt contribute to your college degree metric. College is class warfare, another reason the ‚Äúeducation level‚Äù argument is flawed. 

4. Lastly, my main intent from wanting to pursue this discussion was to get into how American performance in testing has declined over time. Funding for public schools sucks if you are in poor areas. GPA goes up because teacher performance is measured by student performance. It‚Äôs the same reason why attendance goes up when schools get money from the state based on butts in seats. If you want to be truant and your an asshole, the school would rather you go be an asshole somewhere else... until the state passes a law that says the school‚Äôs funding is tied to attendance of enrolled students. Now it is very important you be an asshole in school but ONLY for as long as you have to be. You will not be held back. But if you are just barely going to pass, you just set a grading curve for all the other kids."

It is to absolve them from any perceived wrongdoing and let them have their peace. If they were victims, fight for the ones who still suffer. But carrying the pain of the fallen keeps that pain alive. In my mind it prolongs the life of a wound that should have died with the victim. Give them peace. Fight for them victims who live. Ease their pain so no one has to continue suffering."

WorstYearEverPod,fp35qtq,t3_gazajl,1588273558.0,"Climate change is a huge issue but poverty and health care became so much more important because of Covid-19.

The people who voted in Wisconsin got Covid. Biden has disappeared and Bernie was trying to prevent shit from getting worse. I‚Äôm not happy about it but I think he did what he felt was right. 

Now, as soon as the virus calms down and people can eat and get treated for ailments, I‚Äôm sure everyone wants to worry about climate change again. But you have to understand that the people with money who don‚Äôt want the economy to suffer to save the planet are also the people who want to keep us in wage slavery so we won‚Äôt have the ability to rise up and fight back.

behindthebastards,fp2uzjk,t1_fp2ippd,1588268332.0,"I am pretty sure it‚Äôs a bit but I get the impression that Robert genuinely loathes and despises having to do ad plugs and pivots. After hearing his show and reading his stuff over the past couple of years (I will be honest, I took 6 months and binged everything Robert Evans), I feel - so take this with a grain of salt - that he understands the necessity of ads for his shows but he refuses to take it seriously and is petulant because of it. The show handlers have worked out a deal with the ‚Äúadult in the room‚Äù (Sophie) that so long as it gets done and they keep getting paid, Robert can continue his ‚Äúbit‚Äù and be as petulant as he wants. He is clearly allowed to get away with a lot. Sophie gives him a lot of leeway as producer I think because they are friends and work well together. No one else would allow Robert to behave that way - I don‚Äôt know that he makes THAT much money for them. We all keep listening because of the content and the character though so I‚Äôm glad they worked it out. But yeah, thank the universe for Sophie. I love Robert. He‚Äôs my manic pixie dream girl.

riceuniversity,fp17z1h,t3_gaouqz,1588227007.0,"Do what you can to avoid student loans. Going into debt for a college education is one of our society‚Äôs biggest fucking scams. There is no guarantee of a job after that and the government has shown no sign of helping out with the student debt crisis. The only candidates that actually spoke seriously about addressing the issue and put forth solid plans were not supported by the joke of a ‚Äúleft‚Äù party. I loved my time at Rice but they gave my family need based financial aide. 

With that said, didn‚Äôt I just read an article about Rice not charging tuition for families making under a certain amount of money? 

Not trying to dig into your business, but if your family makes more than whatever and they just aren‚Äôt going to pay for your school then that means you are on your own and maybe you need to take a year off and move out. Talk to someone in financial aide and see what happens if you do that."
BipolarReddit,fozwwzx,t3_ga9sws,1588198322.0,"So - let‚Äôs start with a connection. I went into college/university undiagnosed and developed what I would later (many many years later) a drinking problem. If I recall correctly, my sophomore year, after a failed suicide attempt, I landed in one of the school‚Äôs shrink‚Äôs offices talking about some of my stuff (it would take me many many years to tell a professional about all of my trauma). I was prescribed Prozac (stupid, given everything we know now) and an antipsychotic that I believe makes some men grow breasts if they are on it long enough (risperdal?). I don‚Äôt recall all the specifics. I drank a lot. Also it is not easy to overdose on an SSRI. At least not the one time I tried it when I was 18/19. Not was it easy to overdose on Advil when I tried that when I was 14/15. I was not a smart kid. 

Anyway. I got better. I quit drinking (fucking finally) a little over 3 years ago. I was officially diagnosed bipolar 2 like 10 years ago. My shrink has the patience of a saint. Seven years of hearing ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a problem. I‚Äôm not drinking. I don‚Äôt drink that often...‚Äù He knew. 

I‚Äôm still a work in progress. First time I tried to quit drinking I found online auction sites for legos and spent wayyyyyy too much money because I don‚Äôt like to fucking lose. I‚Äôve got a ton of legos now. Been waiting years to resell them. I really need to but I started my own real business a couple of years ago and don‚Äôt have time. 

It gets better my friend. But it‚Äôs not perfect. Manage those expectations. I almost failed out of university. But I finally got my shit together enough to graduate with a C+ average. At one point I was making a lot more money than I was worth because a company loved me during my manic episodes and looked past the stupid shit that I did when I was trying to drink myself out of my depressive periods. As long as I was making them money it was all good. 

But it wasn‚Äôt all good was it? I was dying. My body was taking a beating from the alcohol and my brain was being throttled by the mania. 

You can figure this all out if you lay out a routine and fucking stick to it. Discipline is critical. But don‚Äôt promise yourself or anyone else the fucking moon and stars dude. You have a disease. Accept that shit and move on. Set the bar at what is achievable and if it‚Äôs too easy while you are getting it done, then reset your goal. Better that than to disappoint yourself early on."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,foxe2ak,t1_fowzqqx,1588141186.0,"I will watch the documentary and wait to pass any judgement.  But let me offer a different perspective on the murder Newton was accused of. 

Why was Newton pulled over that night? What was the officer‚Äôs probable cause for pulling him over? Newton was placed under arrest and THEN a scuffle ensued where Newton was shot in the stomach and the other two officers were also shot. The officer that died was shot with his own service weapon. Newton was not found with a weapon on him.  

So is it a surprise that Newton was eventually acquitted for that officer‚Äôs death?  Because it sounds like two cops got a founder of the black panthers in custody and started to beat his ass. Newton didn‚Äôt like that so he fought back. When that happened one or both cops pulled their guns in close quarters and started firing. They shot Newton but they also shot each other. Sure, Newton may have helped them along, but he wasn‚Äôt armed when the shit went down. That‚Äôs self defense. 

I wasn‚Äôt there. I don‚Äôt know what happened and you don‚Äôt either. I‚Äôm just saying that the shit doesn‚Äôt add up. Plus, if he assumed those two cops were going to beat him to death, he had nothing left to lose, why not fight back. He hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. Why not go fighting for his life?"

I‚Äôm not saying Gates has anything to do with COVID-19 but he is just as guilty of contributing to the problem of our underfunded health and education system as every other one of the captains of industry/oligarchs in our country. The pay to play political system that Gates participates in reeks of crony capitalism and it keeps getting worse. It is the same system they used to oppress freed slaves and later the laborers who wanted to unionize for better (survivable) working conditions. People with money pay for influence over our elected officials and we as constituents suffer for it.
