depression,fn5bj7x,t3_fzmckl,1586660616.0,"Your English is actually pretty good. I’m sorry but it’s hard to just fix it on your own, it’s possible but barely. A therapist or medication can greatly help, if you have a doctor I recommend you talk to one, or a teacher/ guidance counselor at school. I’m sorry about your family, but you won’t live with them forever and that is  what keeps me going. I hope this helps even if just a little bit, good luck"

depression,fn4p2oq,t3_fz9iv1,1586645926.0,"Depression is different for everybody, so I’m not sure if this advice will help. For me sometimes it’s better for a few hours and then worse, if it’s like that for you where it’s different kinda randomly, on when it’s better, try to do even tiny little tasks, try to push yourself extra hard. If you had any hobbies or things that sound interesting, do a tiny bit of that. For example, draw a small doodle, pluck a few strings on your guitar, find a different way to wash your hands, draw on the mirror with water, hand shadow puppets, throw away a piece of trash, anything really. The goal is to do something, even if it’s tiny because it might spark some interest and it won’t seem as bad next time. It might seem like a long shot but it’s worked a few times for me. I hope this helps even a little bit, and I’m sorry that you’re going through this right now."
