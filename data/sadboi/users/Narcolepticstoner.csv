Think of a distressful situation and just sit with yourself and the feelings. You'll notice your mind starting to race with all your thoughts. Itll take practice to tune into your mind like you're listening to the radio play. When you find yourself letting those thoughts come and go, focus on your chest or stomach. Or even your arms. When I get angry and I dont express it, there's heat that radiates through my arms and my chest feels achey. Reflect on any distressing situation. This will all come with practicing this. There's steps to take before you can completely engage yourself while you're in those situations. It'll take time. Best of luck."

DecidingToBeBetter,fg83rld,t1_fg7fta5,1580608748.0,"Honestly seeing how I take care of my baby, framed how to take care of myself. It really blew my mind how I could do so much for him and so little for myself. But taking care of yourself IS part of taking care of your baby. PPD is rough. I encourage you to let those close to you, know about your worry of getting PPD and ask for them to check up on you. A strong support system really really helps during post partum. Also talk to your OB or Midwife about your concerns on developing it. Finding a counselor will give you a good jump start with coping post partum. The most helpful piece of advice I was told, find mommy friends. It's kinda awkward at first but you will find support and give more support than you thought you had in you. I'm not saying this to scare you, but my son was born with medical conditions that really made me isolate for the first full year. That isolation really, really fed into my PPD. When your baby is here and you feel ready to go out and about, check out your local library for baby story time. It's an awesome way to get socializing for both you and baby! Being a mom can feel lonely. If or when you feel this, please hold onto the fact that you are not alone in that feeling. Remembering that made me less afraid to branch out to other moms. Sending some love and courage your wayüíï"

DecidingToBeBetter,fg759tx,t1_fg739kc,1580584324.0,"I looked up therapist in my area and read what they specialize in. I've tried like 6 different therapist so after 7+ years I finally found one! Having my baby really put my need for help into overdrive. I'm neurotic af so it took me a bit to pull apart my behavior and my feelings. For a couple months I really honed in on what my behavior was and how it effected my mood. Lots of introspection before i knew what i really wanted to ask help with. Going to a therapist and being like.. ""I'm a mess idk what i need but I need help"", made it really hard to find one that I clicked with and wanted to keep going back to. So... try to ask yourself some tough questions. Try to look at what you're doing. If it pisses you off... take that as an indicator that that is the something you need help with. If that sounds overwhelming.. start with goals. If the list ends up being 2 pages long... that's okay. Narrow it down. Pick the top 4 that stick out to you. They ask a lot about symptoms so be honest with everything. The doctor will help you with a treatment plan. They have coping skills on hand. Just go into the doctor knowing what is bothering you and they will help you from there. I have ADHD PTSD and Bipolar and an eating disorder. The doctor broke down my symptoms into those categories, we picked 3 coping skills for each of them. I'm sorry for my ramble. Message me any time if that didnt make sense or if it did make sense and you want to talk more. Good for you for recognizing you need help before baby gets here. HUGE STEP!"

It's so confusing. The guilt and shame that we carry because of our own actions.. man. I'm so sorry your ex wife broke your heart.
