relationship_advice,fpgvbhw,t1_fpgppkx,1588610164.0,"That is so true. So often when you have specific boundaries that you set because you arent comfortable with something, people will immediately say that you are insecure, and that you should trust your partner, but its really not about trust. Its plainly that I dont like, I dont want that to be done."
relationship_advice,fpfqr9o,t3_gd1lkq,1588580104.0,"OP, what ever you do, do not add him to your account.  You have been saving that money for so long and the last thing you need is your entitled fiance to take it and drain your account. He clearly wants to use that money, if he didnt, he wouldn't have reacted the way he did. The fact that he is not caring that you need that money to help you mental health is a red flag. Even if you get married, you always need your own security, as you never know another person entirely. That is YOUR security for YOU to take care of YOURSELF. You have worked hard for it and you are not obliged to put him on it, whether you are married or not. Especially that you two arent even married and he is making demands like that... it seems very suspicious to me"

MomForAMinute,fpdi7an,t1_fpdfrd2,1588527481.0,"I have an amazing relationship with his mother. We are like best friends. I'd love to tell her but I'm worried it may be a bit too much for her considering what has just happened to her son. I'm scared it may do more harm than good to tell her, because what if her and I get excited and then when he wakes up he doesnt want it? I will think about it though because it would be so nice to tell someone right now. Thank you"
MomForAMinute,fpda4er,t1_fpd1quh,1588522931.0,Thank you so much. This made me tear up a little. I'm just really emotional at the moment and I dont have many people to talk to right now. So I really appreciate your words. <3 I cant wait to tell him he is going to be a dad! I just wish it was under better circumstances.

relationship_advice,fp5fgh1,t1_fp5exqk,1588327406.0,"My apartment is 2 hours away. I could do the trip in a day. I'll ask my brother to maybe just come, even if it's for a few hours. My mother dislikes my boyfriend so I feel like telling her I'm going to leave for a few hours to go see if he's okay will probably spark more hatred. But right now I dont think I should care about that."
relationship_advice,fp5eyha,t1_fp5ehus,1588326869.0,He mainly uses his phone. I could email him but I doubt he will check it off his computer. I live quite far about 2 hours to my house and another 2 back. So itll be much longer than going to the shop and doctor
relationship_advice,fp5eau6,t1_fp5d7be,1588326158.0,"He is never usually off his phone this long. That's why I am worrying. I haven't told him yet. I didn't even get the chance to tell him I was getting the pregnancy tests. He never flakes out like this. He is always talking and checking up on me. And he is quarantining properly from what I know. He was very serious about it because I have an autoimmune disease and he doesnt want to out me at risk when I eventually go home.

The carer isn't coming at all during quarantine. It's just been me. That's why I wanted to ask for my brother to come so that I can maybe sort some of this stuff out. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, my mother doesnt know. She thinks I'm going to the shops, of coarse I'll go to the shops as well because we need things. I'd prefer for my mother not to know about the possible pregnancy for now."
relationship_advice,fp32nzf,t3_gb19i1,1588272049.0,"To be honest, it does seem strange. But I think it's okay. My story is that when my boyfriend found out I have photos of my ex on my phone, he asked me to delete them. There was never a fight about it, we just both had really strong beliefs about whether I should have them or not. His argument was why would I want that on my phone?(my ex was abusive) but my argument was, I'm not attached to my ex. I'm more attached to the memories, and how happy I was in that moment. Same as now. If him and I were to break up, I wouldnt be able to delete the photos, because of how special they are and the moments they capture together. A couple years down the line, I still have the photos of me and my ex. Not that I'm attached to him, but because the memories are a special part of my life. My boyfriend is happy as long as my ex is blocked and I dont talk to him. 
And for people that want to argue that I'm still attached because I have the photos, wrong. If I was attached I wouldnt have told my ex to f*ck off when he got a new number and tried to contact me.

If it really makes you uncomfortable though that he has the photos on his phone, but he really doesnt want to delete them, ask him to move them to a USB or computer, or somewhere they arent going to come up often. I dont think any partner should guilt trip their partner into deleting them. Not saying you will, just saying in general"
mentalhealth,fp2md6z,t3_garzfq,1588264229.0,People can be very empathetic. Movie directors and authors try their best to make characters seem real by giving them emotions and thoughts. You automatically empathize and start to create a little bond with that and that's why you get so attached.

relationship_advice,fp1gqge,t3_gaplrf,1588234960.0,"Just by trying to educate yourself, You are being so supportive! Just be accepting, and dont make a huge deal about it. Never use it against her.
When I came out to my mother about being bisexual, she told me it was just a phase. Even though I'd felt like that for 5 years. When I tried telling her about it 3 years later, again, she told me I was confused and that it was just a phase. She then also told me I'm not allowed to have girls in my room, when a lot of my best friends were girls. This was one of the worst types of reactions. Being denied of my sexuality and I was always afraid of having a girlfriend, in fear of how she would react."
relationship_advice,foxkwwb,t1_foxfdrd,1588147251.0,I second this comment.
mentalhealth,fovdz57,t3_g9ex1d,1588099721.0,I thought I was the only one that thought this. The children often lash out but when you see the way the parents behave  and act towards the children it's like... what the hell??? Why are they getting the brunt of it. The way the show handled the one girl where they took her out of her home must have been so traumatizing for her and they dont see anything wrong with it?
Pets,fom54sq,t1_fom4x4e,1587878598.0,Aww shame. Poor baby. Sorry that that happened . Do you know if there are ways we can help it not being so itchy?
relationship_advice,fokt1ji,t3_g7vdi9,1587848398.0,"I'm going to be quite honest. I'm bisexual, and I've never had sex with another woman before. Its something I really want to try but I am in a relationship and I feel guilty for it. I spoke to my boyfriend about it, he was quite understanding and said that if I do try it, he would like to know about it, and also  we have spoken about threesomes before. I would like to try oral with a woman oneday, but obviously because my partner doesnt have a... hoohaa.. I cant do it with him. It's very much something a bisexual person would like to explore, but relationships could be constricting and make one feel really bad about it.

She was definitely wrong for doing it behind your back though. She should have spoken to you about it."
mentalhealth,foks7ex,t3_g80u4o,1587847937.0,"You have an awful mother. 

Suicide is not selfish. What is more selfish. Killing yourself and leaving people that didnt make you feel wanted or loved? Or making someone who is going through excruciating emotional pain live because you're selfish and are scared to deal with mourning. It's not selfish at all.

My mother believes my DIAGNOSED mental illness is fake. She said my psychiatrist was too quick to diagnose. I hate her for that, she undermined all my mental struggles and everything I've gone through by saying that.

If you are cutting yourself, it is in your best interest to stop. Its difficult if it's a habit. I know. I understand. I was free from cutting for an entire year, things went side ways and I started again. Try make it something you do when things are really bad and its really necessary, try not do it as a habit. Because it definitely becomes one. 

Try get yourself a helpful support structure. Your mother does not seem to be that."

Harp seals are born white and fluffy, to help them absorb sunlight.

You can tell the difference between them by the flippers, and fur seals have shoulders you can see, harp (harbour and weddel) seals just blop around."
