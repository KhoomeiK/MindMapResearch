I feel like it’s a waste of time even though it’s vital and something really important that we as living beings need to do."

I’m the complete opposite I have to have my phone because being alone in my head isnt something I want especially at a time like that. I look up to you all for being able to do that."

I feel like I need to pray or go sit in the shower or something, cleanse my soul; personally my goal was to not look until or if he showed himself, now that’s gone to SHIT"
StephanieSooStories,etummdw,t3_bzm7p8,1563215683.0,"Bro y would you do that I just got off a post talking about respecting his privacy I scroll down and see this, I’m honestly really pissed you should have put a note saying beforehand he’d be in this picture. Or at least scratch his face out and if there’s ppl who wanna see put a link to it. I feel so dirty like I’ve invaded his privacy.😩"
