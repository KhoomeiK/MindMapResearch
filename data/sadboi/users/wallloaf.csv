AskReddit,fqcrjyy,t3_gi1aiq,1589266604.0,Wow I can't imagine having 500 years. I wonder how much people would procrastinate on stuff. Like proportionally would it take everyone the same time to do the things they do now? Or get around to them?
AdultChildren,fqcrgwl,t1_fqcqtk9,1589266526.0,But did it help you to stick to it long term? And if it did how long did it take? Did you need to find a fellow traveler?

aquarius,flrp90e,t1_flro6yq,1585424939.0,Yeah...hmm with Taurus I almost feel like we can talk about deep stuff but maybe I just don't trust? I'm not sure what it is because I never feel closer even with the deep stuff

aquarius,flp6mc4,t1_flp4rl9,1585352733.0,Yeah with Taurus I always feel like we have a lot in common but then we just don't get along on a personal level

aquarius,flp2fo1,t1_flp0pr1,1585350304.0,"Yeah like both probably really intelligent and can have interesting convos but yeah maybe such an individuated sign that when we are with the same sign, we can't keep up with eachother! I'm sorry your relationship isnt working out :("
aquarius,flp0bhr,t1_flp01bz,1585349112.0,Yea I live with an aqua and feel like we both are so distant/codependent that there is no room for real communication. Like we are constantly chasing/ running away from eachother
aquarius,flozaj0,t1_floyija,1585348522.0,That's interesting that you all don't meet a lot of other aquarians also. I'm surprised when I meet them as well!

And then moments of crashing where I'm like ""oh shit, this isnt going to go away unless I address it."" Or I'll go through periods of feeling like if I just do one thing, everything will be fine and pretending like I'm fine and can just go on ""with a normal life."" But eventually I'll get myself into a crappy situation again with maladaptive coping mechanisms and remember again I'm mentally I'll. Depression sometimes just dulls all the rest."

SuicideWatch,ep9ghje,t3_buam4f,1559109731.0,It is 100% not your fault that it happened and it's more than understandable that it is still bothering you. You are a victim of sexual assault and that is traumatizing and it sounds like you are living with PTSD. Your experience is valid and you are not failure AT ALL. This complete disgusting horrendous garbage human that raped you is who is at fault. Telling us here is a really great start and I am proud of you for vocalizing it :) I'd maybe recommend reaching out to some organizations near you that help sexual assault victims. I can say with certainty that you are not alone in any emotions you are feeling. And then you can perhaps find guidance among those who are well trained and can understand you and can help you work towards telling your partner if you want that. I believe in you and any and all emotions are valid. Each day at a time. I know it's hard but there is hope!
