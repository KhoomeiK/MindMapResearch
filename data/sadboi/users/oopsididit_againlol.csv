bipolar,fr3axku,t1_fr2l95x,1589853513.0,Wow - “wasn’t that time in my cycle” really hits home for me.
Coronavirus,fr35d51,t1_fr2wyk4,1589850278.0,"I feel like a lot of states barely locked down, or if they did not much changed during them. I know that’s definitely true for where I am in South Carolina, which is why I think cases/deaths have stayed consistent the past month and haven’t showed an increase. Haven’t spiked per say but haven’t slowed because behavior didn’t change at all during the “lockdown”."
Coronavirus,fr0on2h,t1_fr0oano,1589802585.0,Absolutely. There are conflicting reports about the count being too low or too high. All I know is they are definitely being skewed one way or another.
Coronavirus,fqz6lz9,t3_glqogt,1589760959.0,"Important distinction to make - if someone has cancer but dies in a car crash, cancer isn’t the cause of death"
ADHD,fqyhu9b,t1_fqygroh,1589748822.0,"Yes it’s prescribed to me, my psych suggested i take a second dose midday instead of taking a higher dose in the morning. That way I wouldn’t have a crazy crash in the afternoon, the second dose would help me comfortably get through the day. Also just as a side note, when I jumped from 30 to 40 it made a huge difference and I’ve stayed at 40 in the morning for at least a year now."
Coronavirus,fqxwzmw,t1_fqxwdk8,1589739130.0,I thought maybe at first that was the case but honestly no. My town is split pretty evenly down the middle politically and it’s a free-for-all here. Many of the people I know going out without a care in the world lean far to the left.
Coronavirus,fqwr7mt,t1_fqwq8qm,1589714883.0,"Those who died from the pandemic (meaning the lockdown) should be counted separately. It is not a fair representation to count those who died by suicide or because they were scared to seek out treatment as a coronavirus death. Those deaths were a result of our response to the pandemic, and if those deaths are increasingly high it would be a reason to start easing restrictions more effectively."
Coronavirus,fqvolvs,t1_fqvmf1t,1589681716.0,It’s very odd watching people’s behavior down here. It seems like they think when they come for vacation they are on vacation from the virus as well.
Coronavirus,fqvidqd,t3_gl5kxb,1589677921.0,Makes no sense my tourist town is PACKED. It looks like a normal summer day at the beach/restaurants/ice cream shops. I’m still so confused by SC numbers.
Coronavirus,fquaynn,t1_fqu68rz,1589655447.0,"To be fair there are people speaking up, they just aren’t given the time of day on mainstream media unfortunately."
Coronavirus,fqu5nb6,t3_gkz1zp,1589652496.0,"If you exclude nursing home deaths the case fatality rate in PA would sit at about .02%. Probably a little less when you account for untested/asymptomatic people. I think it would make sense to report nursing home deaths separately when many states are seeing them comprise at least half their death toll. It almost creates a false narrative, which is not to say those deaths are not significant. We should be protecting those vulnerable members of society with everything we have, but it is also a unique situation where people live in very close quarters and are all at high risk. Including these numbers paints an unfair representation of the burden of coronavirus amongst the general population. Just my opinion of course."
Coronavirus,fqrrts2,t1_fqrrq4x,1589590551.0,Sorry fixed it to say shouldn’t have been counted
Coronavirus,fqrrkeo,t1_fqrpv44,1589590394.0,But shouldn’t have been either way
bipolar,fqpdgng,t1_fqomkoc,1589543389.0,Hahaha omg vitamins cure all didn’t you know?

bipolar2,fqo4o0a,t1_fqo1vck,1589507488.0,"I relate to this so hard. My uncle is schizophrenic and could never manage it very well, so when someone says mental illness that is immediately what they think of. Everything is measured off of him and I don’t fit the same narrative"

Coronavirus,fqnj81w,t3_gjwlls,1589495824.0,Woodstock was held during this
Coronavirus,fqnj1ll,t1_fqnijoq,1589495730.0,Well that’s comforting
Coronavirus,fqniliz,t1_fqnhm71,1589495503.0,Same thing
Coronavirus,fqly9o4,t3_gjmqbv,1589468254.0,Idk why but it wouldn’t shock me if they had a vaccine hidden away somewhere ready to go lol
COVID19_support,fqlfdjn,t3_ginb60,1589456523.0,Woodstock was held in the middle of a pandemic (seriously) mass gatherings will definitely come back don’t worry.
Coronavirus,fqkjs9w,t3_gjdwst,1589428882.0,Still can’t understand how we aren’t exploding with cases down here in South Carolina. We’re either just too spread out or not testing. Probably the latter.
Coronavirus,fqkewjj,t3_gje22u,1589425839.0,Hypertension rate is insane
bipolar,fqk9keb,t3_gjd54r,1589422796.0,"My family doesn’t believe it either, but they’re also not inside of my head. Sometimes the people closest to us can’t see what’s right in front of them."
Coronavirus,fqiz5wf,t1_fqiyrps,1589402867.0,Sales are way down
Coronavirus,fqh7icv,t1_fqh5ypv,1589370208.0,Agreed those shouldn’t be counted as coronavirus deaths. We should be comparing those numbers separately to see the real impact the lockdown is having.
Coronavirus,fqh5u64,t1_fqh51i7,1589368740.0,Yes usually as long as you make sure the credits can transfer over. Would maybe have to take intro classes or lower level classes to make sure they could transfer.
bipolar2,fqg0svz,t1_fqfvwue,1589335571.0,HA don’t call me out like that
bipolar,fqg0hsl,t1_fqcjqbj,1589335392.0,"It’s weird because I also have a fear of dying, yet I feel the urge to just give up all the time. I agree tho - when I’m doing well I’m not scared of much and definitely don’t get the constant inner monologue"
bipolar,fqg0akf,t1_fqc2uuq,1589335273.0,It’s the hardest thing to explain to someone who doesn’t get it which can make it even more frustrating when you reach out for help. Meh
bipolar,fqfkelr,t3_gimy5c,1589326484.0,"I told my ex and I regret it every day. So don’t do that. But tell your closest friends who you know you can trust, it helped release some of the weight off my shoulder telling a few people."

bipolar,fqear9x,t1_fqe1dnb,1589304499.0,I know I take Vraylar but it doesn’t seem to be enough for the intrusive thoughts
bipolar,fqdkjbm,t3_gibkux,1589291596.0,"I take Vraylar also and definitely feel like it’s taken the edge off but not as much as I’d like. Also curious if anyone has experience with this. I’m definitely bored and restless now, but I guess that’s what normal feels like? Maybe that’s just all medication is meant for and the rest I have to work on myself lol meh"
bipolar,fqd7w4o,t1_fqcnqdx,1589282685.0,Thank you! This sub makes me feel so much less alone in this scary world so I really appreciate it

bipolar,fqd7qh2,t1_fqcmsxi,1589282545.0,I know sometimes I realize how weird it is that I’ve basically normalized the words “I wanna fricken kill myself” they almost have no meaning anymore I just blurt them out
bipolar,fqc3dzy,t1_fqbznb1,1589249288.0,"Thank you I really appreciate you linking that! Yes it’s definitely weird though normalizing the thought of dying, but it’s also helpful to not let myself put too much weigh into those thought patterns either."
bipolar,fqc1vka,t1_fqc0p29,1589248406.0,Yes! I’m glad someone else feels the same! I will say things like “I can’t do this anymore” but I don’t really mean it I’m just so frustrated it’s the only thing I can think of to describe my emotions.
bipolar,fqbw9mx,t3_ghzyrs,1589245164.0,Medication is the only thing that gives me slight relief. That and having a strict bedtime routine.
bipolar,fqbv44o,t1_fqbuoqi,1589244512.0,I definitely will thanks for the recommendation. It’s so weird how it’s just become a part of my daily routine. It’s like I just blurt it out without really understanding what it means and it understandably freaks people out lol

bipolar,fqbtese,t1_fqbrf4b,1589243562.0,Totally! I feel like no one understands that I’m not really suicidal. I guess it’s more of a self hatred thing?
bipolar,fqbtczw,t1_fqbni49,1589243534.0,Agreed. It’s crazy sometimes on this sub wen I realize everyone else feels the same

bipolar,fqblnw7,t3_ghyz6v,1589239316.0,I feel the same. Always seem to be bored and tired except for when it’s time to sleep. So sorry you are feeling this way I know first hand how hard it can be.
ADHD,fq8fjht,t3_ghf7qg,1589165058.0,Do you take medication? I don’t mean that in a condescending way at all btw just that I have to read or do schoolwork when my vyvanse first kicks in. If I’m reading when it kicks in I can focus in on the words more.

BipolarReddit,fq68umy,t3_gh3rzp,1589126827.0,"I totally understand where you are coming from and sometimes I feel insanely guilty for feeling the way I do despite my privilege in this world. My parents would go to the ends of the earth for me so it’s hard for me when I let them down or have another episode. The fact that you are in school is amazing, you can push forward I promise. Your life has so much meaning, and hopefully in a few years you can look back on this period and be proud of yourself for making it through.

Coronavirus,fpwl88c,t1_fpwkwy1,1588965422.0,The problem is people think lives taken by coronavirus are somehow more important than any number of other deaths caused by a complete and total shutdown. The numbers for suicide and domestic violence alone will be staggering after all is said and done. There has to be a middle ground.

bipolar,fpu35ic,t1_fpu2zr4,1588903658.0,Definitely keep your psych updated! I react totally different to Vyvanse since I started taking the Vraylar so I’m hoping it helps you!!
bipolar,fpu2pig,t1_fpu2fqg,1588903392.0,"It definitely made me feel manic until I started taking an antipsychotic. I take Vraylar with it now and it’s a great combination, the vyvanse actually ends up mellowing me out and helping me focus. But definitely need the Vraylar with it otherwise I am too uppity.

bipolar,fptqgrd,t1_fptpyjf,1588896207.0,It does but can be missed pretty easily - people think it just means an energetic kid but ADHD can manifest in a ton of different ways
bipolar,fptpzlu,t3_gfi3im,1588895943.0,"I take Vyvanse with Vraylar and it helps me a ton! It actually relaxes me and takes away some of my anxiety for a good chunk of the day. When combined with the Vraylar it doesn’t make me go off the edge like it might if taken on its own. Definitely talk to your psychiatrist about it - I was never formally diagnosed with ADHD but my psych recommended taking Vyvanse to help with issues concentrating, daydreaming too much, etc. as well as depression. It helped me get out of bed and get motivated for sure but without the Vraylar made me feel too uppity if you know what I mean."

Their is also a crazy disparity in the male/female deaths  - I know this has been talked about but interesting to see the actual numbers"
