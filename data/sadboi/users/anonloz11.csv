horror,ffei1e1,t3_esl7cv,1579848830.0,"My favourite horror film of 2019 is currently Midsommar, directed from Ari Aster & produced by A24. But I also enjoyed watching “Truth or Dare” from Blumhouse. Currently can’t wait for “Antlers” (non-blumhouse) & “Fantasy Island” (blumhouse) to come out in Cinemas so that I can watch them for 2020! Also hope to watch “Black Xmas” from Blumhouse sometime soon. Didn’t get to watch it in cinema last month unfortunately!"
horror,ff8k398,t3_es54hr,1579682228.0,"For me, I’ve always had a fascination for Horror since I was a little child. While I didn’t understand how horror actually worked as a little child, I liked looking at visual stills from horror movies and imagining a scenario from that picture. It’s even more ironic as I have Christian Parents that have always hated horror (My dad has been more lenient over the years, and now we both enjoy watching horror shorts on YouTube & horror films generally). But it’s definitely always been there for me."

My old chinchilla cat, named Leia, actually saved my life as a baby. She saw that my face was turning blue and my mum was sleeping in another room at the time. Leia went to her & licked her face until she woke up, then my mum was able to get me breathing again. 
Sometimes, I think it wasn’t worth it. But then I remember that Leia’s legacy has to keep going. She died back in 2009. Gotta keep that memory alive of my old cat. She was absolutely beautiful, probably one of the main reasons that I can keep going."

I’m hoping to see someone about my problems next year, but there’s also a side to me that isn’t counting on it.

I hope you have a Good Christmas & New Years anyway. I hope it’s not a sad time, but if it is then I also understand 😢 Hope Things Get Better for you soon x"

AskReddit,fb372t2,t3_eauhhu,1576465788.0,"This isn’t as bad as some of the comments I’ve read, but here -

Unemployment is one thing. Another thing would have to be the moment I finally got my emotions back (as soon as I finished school, last year).
You see, I never really focused on my future or what I want to do bc everyone has always ever told me I’m a “good student” who “will succeed”
I was in the toxic group at school, which made me suppress my mental health bc I just wanted to “survive” year 12 - and I didn’t have the confidence to find another, much healthier, group of friends. Also doesn’t help when you’ve got an emotionally abusive mother. 

My “leader” of my friendship group was always telling me what I should do with my life & pushing me to make a decision. The truth is that, because I’ve never wanted to make a proper decision about my life until I finished school, where I was hoping to find a job immediately afterwards. It was all very toxic and I thought it was normal behaviour.

Also, since finishing school, my friendship group has dissolved completely. We were all too different, the only thing we had in common were toxic traits. Not a good look. I’m trying to get better at not being very toxic anymore. But I can’t forgive myself for the way I’ve treated certain others within my friendship group. I’ve also cut some of them out of my life for this reason, too. I genuinely think that they all deserve better. 

So like I said, not exactly as bad as others have had it (due to it being self-made decisions, at the end of the day). But yeah, that’s that. 

TRDR; Pushed my emotions anyway, had to deal with emotional consequences once school ended."
depression,fafhwuz,t3_e8wf5e,1576023163.0,"Happy Birthday, Bud. Hope you have a great day, regardless of how things turn out. Sorry to hear.

I’m the same really. The only difference is that I still have people in my life by force, not by my own choice. The only reason this is, is bc I’m still living with my parents so I can never truely be alone, which is both good and bad.

For my 21st, I want to invite people. I have lots of choices, but the problem for me is that a lot of these “friends” I have in my life I only see as acquaintances, either because we’ve had friendship problems I need to get over, or I don’t trust them enough to consider them friends (particularly with newer friends in my life). Still struggling NGV to remind myself that people are there - I have one close friend, but I can’t even open up to her anymore. It sucks.

However, when it comes to birthdays - the last thing I want to do is celebrate it with anyone, outside of this one close friend I have. I want to feel more independent (not very independent due to Autism & My own bad choices for life decisions) and one way of doing this is celebrating my birthday & purchasing my own gifts with just myself. This is just my experience, anyway. Been feeling a bit better lately (outside of Yesterday - trying to forgot that)"
depression,f9omz58,t3_e65utk,1575508566.0,"Absolutely. At the moment, I have wasted an entire year applying for jobs but I haven’t received any sort of job so far. I have a phone interview tomorrow, and I’m doing as much research about the company & overthinking what I’m going to say about myself in my head for the time being. 

However, I feel like crap bc I am currently a volunteer at a very nice store, and I don’t go in much. I pretend that I’m very busy with job applications when my managers & co-workers ask me how I’ve been, where I’ve been and stuff like that. I can’t tell them the truth - some days, I just don’t feel like coming in. My days are already restricted bc I switch between my mums house & my dads house a lot, but on the days where I’m available, I just don’t feel like going in. There’s no explanation for it. The closest thing I can think of is, because there has been a lot of changes in our store socially, it’s not the same for me. 

Because I’m Autistic, I am very hesitant to changes being made in my general life. I look at when I first started at my volunteer position (young, full of hope, started getting familiar with faces) and now (lots of the “familiar faces” don’t in as much themselves anymore, or they’ve left completely, too many new faces to get to know about, gotten too used to my jobs around store, feeling old) it’s just too much for me to cope with. I haven’t really told anybody the truth yet and, when I do, it’s with a “laid-back” attitude which doesn’t make it sound very serious. 

However, on the flip side, I have definitely attended loads of interviews on the side (even if I haven’t gotten the jobs themselves) & that definitely helps me grow closer & closer to a potential first job. I’m also considering studying next year, which would exhaust me for different reasons."
depression,f9fn25p,t3_e4txsf,1575279897.0,"I know how this feels - I’ve always felt stressed over my life & thought that quitting my school choir (back when I was in school, that is) would be a good choice for me to relax and sit back. However, this just ended up being one of the iceberg tips that turned my life completely upside down. I couldn’t focus on school completely after that, and it was like I’d lost a general piece of myself. Still feel that way currently. Nowadays, creative things like Art & Music bore me - and every time I’ve tried to create something or write new song lyrics, I feel like it’s a chore/task so I end up getting angry. 

Haven’t done much with my life over the years, aside from general school stuff & graduated last year. However, none of these things feel like achievements bc I know that it’s just all societally constructed in my eyes. Sometimes, the truth hurts more than a simple lie. I also have many friends in my life, but only one feels like a true friend. 

Doesn’t help when you live with an emotionally abusive mother who constantly points out the flaws in your life, offers no emotional support & aside from her telling me that she “knows what it’s like” she responds quite differently to me. Says that she knows the truth always & no one likes her for it, implying that I don’t like confronting issues (could be true, though?). Sorry if this is a long comment - I honestly didn’t know what else to do."
