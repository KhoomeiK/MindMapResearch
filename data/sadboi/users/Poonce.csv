Started it back up in March and feeling great.   I had severe withdrawals after stopping xanax that I took for two months.  I was prescribed xanax because my anxiety and panic attacks that came with my HPPD was so bad.  I wouldn't worry about gabapentin.   Everyone is different though.   I believe it helps repair your gaba receptors which is a good thing for drug users.

I initially asked my doctor for gaba because I heard it helps repair the areas of the brain xanax drains and damages.   Did the trick. Might be something to it for  our overall issues too"

One day, after a doctor told me I might have a brain tumor, I thought taking a dose would chill me out.   I had a terrible trip and since then I've had it.  This also makes me think it is slightly related to a firm of PTSD.   No tumor at least after I got an MRI.  

Take it slow, I'm basically cured now and propranolol will help.  It's pretty safe and if you are having a hard time in the moment, you can take one more if needed.   See how you react to it, but it shouldn't be a problem"

HPPD,f7y4rzk,t1_f7xszes,1574086456.0,"So,  the low blood pressure moments were due to the trauma I believed I was having.   After everything that had started, i then had very high blood pressure. Still not sure why I had the feint issues. 

Actually, quite bad blood pressure.  I was dealing with all the visual phenomena with full panic attacks,  dp/dr and had purchased a home blood pressure kit that kept me obsessed and terrified.  

I was prescribed propranolol, a simple beta blocker, I highly recommend.   No bad side effects besides no caffeine.   That sucked for awhile.   Im half Irish and half Italian off the boat.  Coffee and tea are extremely ingrained.  I was also prescribed xanax which withdrawals made everything so much worse. 

Anyways, I had high blood pressure, almost hypertension, but I knew it was due to other things like the anxiety hppd brought me.   Since I've gotten it all under control, it's all basically gone back to normal. 

Im a recent 31 year old,  and I found I can still enjoy a drink or two without issues,  never enjoyed weed much,  but have been able to move past prescriptions and been okay again.  
I've done just about everything under the sun. 

For 5 years I took lsd 2 times a week without any issues.  Things weren't always positive on it, but outcomes over time healed a lot of mental wounds.   Before my hppd I gave multiple talks and wrote multiple papers on the benefits of psyches especially lsd.

After 7 to  8 months of recovery, I believe the majority of symptoms are tied to trauma,  impure product,  anxiety and existential crises. 

I still suffer strong swings in symptoms in highly stressful situations and existentially hard thoughtful moments.   I embrace the visual disruptions to normality. 

We'll all find our path through this."

HPPD,f7xib79,t3_dxy1hs,1574058713.0,"I had been using lsd for years.  Got me over severe PTSD due to witnessing friends kill themselves in different ways first hand.   I was cured.   One day, I went to a doctor after an episode of syncope fainting and extreme vertigo.  It was completely outta nowhere.   I've never had full anxiety and or panic attacks.   

I went to multiple doctors and they believed that all the symptoms I was going through now, meant I might have a brain tumor.   I didn't have insurance,  I was terrified.   I took acid to try and see if I could center myself.  It went out of control, even though I was slowly micro dosing through the day.   I lost my shit thinking I was going to feint again in the trip.    That began the horrible spiral into the dp/dr fosters and all the symptoms we know and discuss. 

Since then, hppd, but no brain tumor. Thank the universe.  8 months clean of mind altering substance including caffeine.  I've massively recovered since then, but it felt like a long road.   This wad this year everything happened.  Because I believe hppd is a form of ptsd and I took years really honing in on the root of my original ptsd issues, I was equipped to overcome.   My hppd still swings at me in moments of extreme stress or even simple work anxiety, but I know what it is and have beaten it before.
