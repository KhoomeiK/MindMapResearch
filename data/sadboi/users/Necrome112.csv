GamingLeaksAndRumours,fr1ehej,t1_fr19ynd,1589818303.0,I still remember when first talks of Horizon Zero Dawn being released on PC came people were dismissing it left and right saying nah Sony wont do that. But they did. I'm not saying Bloodborne will indefinitely come to PC but being open to the idea isn't insane.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fqsym1v,t1_fqsvbhz,1589623696.0,I'm still surprised the fanboy culture hasn't stopped. Guys they are companies they don't give a damn about you.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fqsyh4p,t3_gklgp8,1589623551.0,Finally! Walking dead is such a great franchise for survival horror if the leak is true glad they are going in this direction.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fq6cb1x,t1_fq6anvz,1589128758.0,Why though. Besides RTX and faster load times you aren't going to see much graphical finnesse in next gen for some time. It will take around 2-3 years for that.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fp96310,t1_fp754xd,1588415759.0,Exactly people just trust companies. Doesn't matter how consumer-friendly they are their number one concern is and always will be money so saving their image by lying is completely plausible.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fp95uy2,t1_fp79pef,1588415515.0,"I think reading that 4chan plot leak and also the fact that the leaker showed specifically the part where >!Joel dies as well as playing as Abby after that!< , I don't think whoever showed was excited to show how much he loved the game rather destroy the game by specifically showing clips that would have a divisive reaction. Nobody so far that have seen the leaks love it. It's most likely still a dev but disclosing that  would be bad press for Sony as well as Naughty Dog so they say ""not affiliated"". No playtester has a devkit so i don't think its a playtester."
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fp2kzea,t1_fp2cxn3,1588263553.0,"I don't think it's only how Joel gets killed is the problem as in most post apocalyptic stories main characters get killed but the thing is the final part where you take control of Abby and kill Ellie this is just horrible. I get the idea of different perspectives but why though.

Even if players have sympathy for what happened to her there is no connection like with Joel and Ellie. I personally think the story and characters got butchered for the sake of implying a message about hate. 

Also this is just the second installment, its not like the third or fourth so it is just too early to switch protagonists. Everyone is a villain in someone's story but we can't go around justifying each and every one of them."
Games,fouhdik,t3_g8rpb7,1588084097.0,"Spoilers:

>!The idea of seeing the consequences of events of the first game from a different perspective is actually good but it doesn't work for this game or series(Last of Us) because the plot was never the strong point it was always about the characters and their arcs. When you build such a strong foundation with Joel and Ellie and in the next installment suddenly shift the perspective it adds nothing but shock value or ""Oh they did some fucked up shit to those people"". I compare the scene of Joel getting beaten to death with that of David Dunn getting drowned in a puddle in the movie Glass.... absolutely anti climatic  and unnecessary.!<

>!Everyone is a villain in someone's story that doesn't mean we have to justify each and every one of them. I could see this as a spinoff or a dlc with no actual consequences but as a main installment? Hell no.!<

>!There are so many other things that you could have explored like how is Ellie immune? Where is her mother? What about the government? Fungi only grows worse with age and how worse has it gotten? !<"
GamingLeaksAndRumours,foimx5d,t1_foilpdg,1587790826.0,You're asking as if we're all From Software insiders just not telling you anything. This guy was decent enough to link you to a subreddit that has more information and you just demand release dates of the gameplay trailer. Don't be an asshole.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,foi9zec,t1_foi8o7q,1587781863.0,Probably Maroon 5 concert in Fortnite like the recent Travis Scott one but seems a bit far fetched.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,foe7vak,t3_g70oxo,1587697811.0,Its truly about the aura of the leaker. If a leaker gives off a red aura he cannot be trusted but.. if he were to give a blue or even green aura we can trust him. It would also benefit by observing his exp. If he has a high exp then there's nothing to worry about him.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,foe11rz,t1_foctwns,1587693943.0,Another Sony fanboy.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,focb2ia,t1_foc78wt,1587669219.0,No that's Rare not the Initiative. Initiative is probably working on a new IP.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,foc24np,t3_g6rlh9,1587666253.0,This seems like what Assassins Creed is these days.
tipofmytongue,fo9395j,t1_fo90d49,1587609542.0,Solved!
tipofmytongue,fo92f6t,t1_fo90fao,1587609015.0,Thanks buddy.
tipofmytongue,fo92epv,t1_fo90d49,1587609007.0,Thanks a lot man.
tipofmytongue,fo909mi,t3_g6ebqj,1587607646.0,Thanks in advance for anybody trying to guess this movie. It's been bugging me for a long time.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fo7xos1,t3_g674w3,1587586327.0,Okay this kind of posts need to be banned.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnyan6a,t3_g4lgai,1587357657.0,More of an rpg? Man can't wait to buy those credit boosters.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnvm98w,t3_g46ia7,1587298353.0,June is the month almost all announcements would be made.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnvm700,t3_g46kfi,1587298294.0,Well atleast you're looking forward to a great career as a writer.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnsrica,t1_fnrx5c7,1587227415.0,I don't think gameplay is ready especially because of how Todd Howard talked about this game. It still seems to be in early or mid stages of production. But the teaser described here may be showcased for Microsoft's event.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnp543m,t1_fnp48dw,1587139373.0,what about the AAA Marvel Project Netherrealm though?
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnlclta,t1_fnlbz7d,1587051166.0,He's saying that because of the history Crysis has.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnh0w7h,t3_g1q8e9,1586951739.0,Ummm
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fmvwsl6,t3_fxpcnj,1586433540.0,It seems nonsensical as then they would never showcase the console to the public and Xbox was very open in allowing many youtubers as well as media to try out their consoles.
CrackWatch,fmvku2f,t1_flbg93s,1586420639.0,It nails the atmosphere and gunplay but if you're looking for an immersive story there isn't one. It builds intrigue but besides that there isn't much variety. I personally played it singleplayer and loved it just for the atmosphere.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fm96mxj,t1_fm8welq,1585862714.0,In concept it sure is revolutionary the only question being if they could pull it off without compromising stability.
rpg_gamers,fg3nwg8,t1_fg3k7c4,1580485883.0,It is! Was planning to play it for a long time until i forgot it's name.
rpg_gamers,fg2rekg,t1_fg2othg,1580452864.0,"Okay so i found the game. It was ""I have no mouth and i must scream"""
tipofmyjoystick,fg2rcnp,t1_fg2r7xs,1580452808.0,Wow Yes! thankyou buddy.
rpg_gamers,fg2pzpp,t1_fg2othg,1580451396.0,"I think it's definitely isometric and it also mentions a virtual simulation so kinda like a techy version of the ""its all a dream plot"". Also older graphics kind a like planescape but with a slightly higher resolution."
rpg_gamers,fg2nqh3,t1_fg2nggv,1580449217.0,"So you have played through the whole game and is that 'the big reveal'? 

I had though it was planescape torment but when i searched online there was nothing like 'simulated nightmare world' or anything. Thanks for replying."
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fftconi,t3_ev565j,1580216566.0,Glad they are sticking to First person. Now we have two types of Resident Evil games to play. With the remake being third person and the new ones bring First.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,ff6antp,t3_erumm5,1579623028.0,This looks just like Warframe with Remnant of the Ashes melee gameplay.
unpopularopinion,fd2f4d1,t3_cto7qw,1578146311.0,"I've seen a few of Danny's videos and i think his comedy is barebones. He picks on at the simplest things just to criticize someone and the greatest examples are his videos of Tessa Brooks where its just a harmless vlog. 

Drew Gooden on the other hand is fantastic. The main thing is that most of his videos provide positive valid criticism with awesome humor. He seems more amused than annoyed at some of the things he is commenting on."
netflix,fceyueh,t3_egoh09,1577624972.0,"I was really beginning to enjoy the plot and i think the show is well written except for recurring white privilege part. I mean they say ""white privilege"" like 10 times in a single episode. Where at one point Chris d Elia has a dialogue saying "" Hey that's the least a privileged white asshole could do right?"" The dialogue seemed so awkward."
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fbywhg8,t3_ef6own,1577228220.0,Correct me if i'm wrong. You claim to be a QA tester yet you have stated multiple times that the game was barely finished. You said that you tested the gameplay but then mentioned before that Rockstar said they are only going to retool it. Why test such an early unfinished build? QA testers aren't given builds like these.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fb1amkt,t1_fb11des,1576434158.0,Why though? The points he made seems very logical and smart for a company to do.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fb0xd5m,t1_faztdqy,1576430143.0,I think in a way it is an exclusive. A Microsoft exclusive. Also making games available to pc players is a very good move both business wise and for the community.
depression,f8xs04p,t3_e2gnrw,1574931236.0,If i could i'd sleep all the time. It takes so much of the pain away. But i can't. I'm doing my last semester for my degree so there's constant deadlines for projects and assignments making the schedule tight.
depression,f8sp8tr,t3_e1zaae,1574786059.0,"Hey buddy i understand how you feel as i've felt lonely throughout my college years till now being the final year. I don't know how i got through them. Its also not as easy as the guy before me is saying "" Put yourself out there!"" doesnt always work. If you try too hard you'll make fake ones that are even worse than being lonely."
depression,f8so72f,t3_e1u1c2,1574785378.0,I felt the very same. I thought about how i would hurt others if i did it and was scared to go through with it. Its a torture that at this point i've grown used to. The optimistic side in me has long been dead and i always find myself holding on to my life considering my family.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,f8pjx11,t3_e12q60,1574702719.0,Thank god its linear. i just dont see an SC game working with an open-world and its much better to follow gameplay as the previous titles.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,f81wxy2,t3_dyk74r,1574179163.0,Hmm Ubisoft had made a statement that all future AC games would have a choosable male/female protagnist though.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,f5sryb0,t3_dp5qio,1572441567.0,Still there was some gameplay element of connecting players or something and you barely mentioned any such thing.  I have to agree from what i saw the gameplay shown looked kinda boring but i'd hoped the whole game would be better. Anyway taking this with a huge grain of salt.
depression,f0zb7bu,t3_d7bjii,1569091010.0,"Hey buddy. I feel the same and its unfortunate how no one gets it. They're like its okay it'll pass. I was very reluctant to see a doctor since i was convinced that nobody would understand but there was a point i couldn't take it anymore. So i saw this psychologist and began to tell her how i just hoped that i would die and how hard it is to just be among people and getup everyday.. and she yawned. At that point i just said ""thank you for your time. "" paid her and just went home. Sometimes a person shows interest to hear you talk about how depressed you are but its just to satisfy their curiosity and once they hear everything, they want nothing to do with you. Now i just live on.. empty,broken, directionless until someday i get peace."
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,f020m0c,t1_f02008s,1568321497.0,This is Disney and even though its pc bullshit that's what makes money now.Inclusion in casting is hot on the market and we know they don't actually care about representing people of color but as the first comment says its all about who is casted.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,eynn6tj,t1_eylscch,1567253447.0,Do you even know what a devkit is? There is no such thing as a devkit for a DLC. A devkit is given by console companies to make games for their platforms.Why in god's name should a game company make one?
