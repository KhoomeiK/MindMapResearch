I got lucky that I got properly educated before it was too late and now I have proper oral hygiene, however, my bone loss and gum recession are permanent though halted. 


The bone loss wasn't painful, I didn't even realize it was happening. The gum recession wasn't painful either, maybe only in the fact that the roots of your teeth become more exposed as the gum recedes and can be more sensitive. Again, this is why people start out with reversible gingivitis and it can turn into full-scale perio. People in general but even more so people who are unable to afford preventative medical care, usually take pain as an indicator of finally seeking help. No pain= no seeking help= progression of the disease until more noticeable."

This isn't to be rude or make you feel bad especially that I am not really a tough love type of person most of the time... But this is the reality of military relationships. Period. You will never know anything and when you think you know something it will change about 20 times. The service member deals with the same thing; never knowing how long their day it going to be, never knowing what tomorrow will bring, and again if they think they knowing will have changed last minute. I will say some units and branches are better than others but this is especially true of the Army.


 I understand you're in a bit of a unique situation because there's the ""will he or won't he"" aspect but if you decide to have a relationship or not this is something you'll need to make peace with for your own wellbeing. As far as him not having time for you... It happens, again it's part of being in the military. Having time for someone gets boiled down (at times) to just barely being able to send a text or make a phone call saying ""hey I know we haven't been able to have quality time but I'm still here and I still love you and I'm looking forward to when we can be together again"" that was literally almost my entire first year of marriage with a blissful 3ish month break somewhere in the middle. You adjust and you manage. As long and the service member is willing to make you a priority *when they are able to* it can work out. 


I would figure out if he plans on being career or not. If he isn't then the lifestyle isn't permanent and it's a temporary  sacrifice you might be able to handle better than you think. Just be aware that some service members are dicks and will re-enlist despite talking with their spouse about how they're for sure getting out. I wouldn't necessarily agree that no one is cut out for it but it is HARD on nearly everyone and everyone finds different ways to manage. For some it takes longer than others. The people who call their spouse's chain of command to complain how they've barely been home all week are not cut out for this. That doesn't mean they can't learn but if they don't they simply weren't meant to handle this type of life and I don't blame them.

I was so fucked up I couldn't tell the assistant to turn it down. I was screaming in my head to tell her but it just wouldn't come out. Other stuff happened too but I'll spare the boring details. After she turned it off I felt like shit and was almost in shock. I drove home and my husband was concerned with the way I was acting to the point he asked if I had been assaulted and was just afraid to tell him.

USMilitarySO,fo09qiu,t1_fnzpe65,1587408585.0,If it will be any help to your boyfriend I'd like to share some of my husband's experiences. It sounds like your boyfriend isn't like the people he's been hanging out with. My husband is definitely far from the stereotypes he was surrounded by. Just because you are surrounded by certain types of people you don't need to be immersed with them or spend voluntary time with them. Sometimes that means you will be flying solo for the sake of your integrity and morals. That's when you find things to fill time and enrich yourself like reading or building something. Sometimes that means you limit the types of activities you do with those people. Maybe they act fine while playing basketball but get rowdier when they go bar hopping. It's up to your boyfriend to manage his own exposure to things that he ultimately doesn't want to be or become.

edit: I showed my husband the post and he replied ""Those look *exactly* like your bagels"" so I guess I've been doing them right. lol"

I do think that's entirely possible, to his credit. I would tell him that it kind of messed you up to the point that it's still a worry of yours especially with the military thing coming up. Lay things out, be specific and upfront. If you aren't sure you're on the same page about a certain behavior, make sure it gets discussed because when deployments and long trainings come up you want to have confidence in each other and ensure there aren't excuses of ""well one thing led to another and we didn't discuss that so I thought it'd be okay"" etc. Like I mentioned before, a big thing imo is peer pressure. If you can trust him to stand his ground and not get swept up in the moment then that trust will go far because it doesn't matter if someone has good values if they can't stick to them."
USMilitarySO,fn7rxf1,t3_g0284q,1586726409.0,"Maybe it's just me but I would NOT consider your boyfriend's behavior normal. At least normal for a well- adjusted mature adult but everyone is different and some couples openly check out and comment on people together- to each their own. To be clear, I'm not saying he shouldn't find anyone else attractive but healthy individuals who are committed to monogamy are generally able to accept that other people are attractive and leave it at that. They don't dwell on it to the point they are objectifying them by describing them to their SO, that's pretty immature and to me shows lack of control. When in the military you will have a lot of close contact with everyone especially if they deploy. A LOT of cheating goes on or at least trashy behavior. If he is someone who is easily pressured by his peers this will be an even bigger issue that will make things worse. There is no way in hell my relationship would survive military service and deployment if I didn't trust my partner to honor and respect our marriage even when we are unable to communicate and vice versa.

I will be completely honest with the information you've provided and say that I do not get a good feeling about his behavior when mixed in the military setting. Just gives me bad vibes but you know him better than we do here."
