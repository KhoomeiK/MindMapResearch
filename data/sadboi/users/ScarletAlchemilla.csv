It’s just a matter of being patient and letting it regenerate before diving back in again. There are statues scattered throughout the path that give infinite Soul, so make sure to stick up and heal up every time you reach them. One of them is hidden too, so don’t be afraid to look for a breakable wall on safe platforms.

There’s also a fight at the end with two Kingsmoulds, so you’ll want add in whatever other charms you’ll need to be prepared for that."
HollowKnight,fqnlw1k,t3_gjt9bz,1589497200.0,"My go-to charm set for most of PoH is as follows:

1) Sprintmaster
2) Quick Focus
3) Unbreakable Strength
4) Mark of Pride
5) Steady Body

After Hornet Sentinel, I switch out Mark of Pride for Longnail and add in Defender’s Crest to help with Lost Kin, but after that section, I go right back to the original charm set. So far, I’ve gotten all the way up to Pure Vessel, but I’ve always died to them so I can’t say how well the set works with Absolute Radiance yet."

It just clicked into place and as I looked at how many comments there were agreeing with you, I began to realize that maybe I’m not the only one who feels like this. I myself tend to let myself cry myself out whenever I feel like this or try to reach out to close friends who can make me feel some semblance of belonging, but I know not everyone may have such a way of dealing with this kind of experience.

I don’t know what’s happening in your specific situation, but I wish you all the best and that you find a place comforting and safe enough to *truly* call home. Be that a person, a house, or some other obscure area, I hope you find it. Best wishes. Stay safe."
