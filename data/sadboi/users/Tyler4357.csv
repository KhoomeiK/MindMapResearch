Hundreds of rabbits an small game get hit everyday by cars an large corporations are polluting so much water there killing off entire species of fish. I just wanna try my luck at living like people did back in the day. An if I try an fail then at least I can shift my focus on to something else. I‚Äôve looked all over for somewhere I could live a nomadic off the land lifestyle for a period of time an it doesn‚Äôt seem to exist. There is nowhere that you can legally do that unless you own the land which would cost you millions. The most I could possibly by is 20-30 acres which isn‚Äôt large enough to live what they consider off the grid. I spend my days working as a brick layer and my nights out in the woods any woods I desire. I‚Äôm chomping at the bit to get out of the rat race for awhile. An the AT seemed like a good fit because it‚Äôs a dedicated trail compared to what I was gonna do which was just start walking west. It gives me a set goal which can be broken down into smaller goals which helps with my anxiety. An to socialize with other hikers. Compared to if I was just walking west people would just see what they assumed was a homeless guy with a big backpack 

I‚Äôm sorry this has gotten so off topic y‚Äôall but thank you so much for the useful information you have provided me with. Sorry if my ideas views an plans offends anybody I‚Äôm not trying to cause any trouble our harm.

To come home to a sluggish an underfunded VA who doesn‚Äôt wanna really help me anymore because I got addicted to heroin after I got out. It helped me get through the days when I first got out an could barely get out of bed because of my depression. I‚Äôm 279 days clean now (which I did on my own accord for a son I had on the way that unfortunately didn‚Äôt make it to term) but when I go to the VA I‚Äôm treated like a drug seeker an denied access to most of the effective medicines an just kind of swept under rug. 

Sorry for the tangent but I feel I deserve the right to take a few rabbits with a very small recurve bow that couldn‚Äôt kill a deer or any large game and to catch a few fish so that maybe I can find a renewed since of purpose and to wake up with the desire to live. Not just to cope. An to see some of these states I sacrificed a lot for not as much as others tho...

But if there is somewhere that I can fulfill this calling without breaking a few rules I‚Äôll be more than happy to listen. But tbh I need this.

Any four walls can be a prison an I live in one everyday it feels sometimes."
AppalachianTrail,fisy8kp,t1_fiswc5b,1582697051.0,"I‚Äôm not %100 percent set on this packing list. An I‚Äôm definitely taking into account everyone‚Äôs recommendations. Your right about the food being buy it now an buy it later isn‚Äôt much difference. My recurve is extremely light an fits perfectly between the back bracing on my ruck. 
One thing I‚Äôm going to for sure cut down on is the food I‚Äôm packing to begin with. As far as clothes go. Out in the field having a fresh pair of socks an make or break you. An they weigh next to nothing. My ruck sack fits all this fairly well. An I‚Äôm not sure switch to a different ruck now would be a good idea since I‚Äôm accustomed to this one an it‚Äôs surprisingly very comfortable an has slot of adjustments to get a nice fit.

I am listening to everything y‚Äôall are saying an I appreciate the advice so please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm foolishly disregarding so I can Rambo it out there.
Besides food my tent is my next biggest weight. 

My most bulky item by far has to be my sleeping bag can anybody recommend a good one?

Also let‚Äôs say I set myself to cut back as much weight as possible what‚Äôs a reasonable weight?"
AppalachianTrail,fisp0ce,t3_f9micp,1582689569.0,"I should add I‚Äôm trying to do the entire hike in 7-8 months The time it takes to complete doesn‚Äôt matter much to me. There‚Äôs nothing back at ‚Äúhome‚Äù I‚Äôll miss. 

But I know currently I can hike 10 miles with this load out an then work as a tree trimmer the next day."
AppalachianTrail,fisogwl,t1_fisnosl,1582689195.0,"Thank you for the advice. I‚Äôll do my best to apply it. Until I started researching for this trip I never considered 75 lbs to be heavy packing me and a old battle buddy of mine stupidly challenged are selfs to load 135 pounds into are rucks we didn‚Äôt know the weight before we started we both just borrowed sapi plates from everyone we could for a 20 mile ruck. I‚Äôve never regretted a decision more an my life and was the closest I‚Äôve ever came to giving up. Took about a week to recover and the next day sucked more than the ruck-March by far.  

In all honesty the difficulty an the challenge of it is what I enjoy it‚Äôs the only time I feel alive and not a failure."
AppalachianTrail,fisn9nf,t1_fism6mj,1582688379.0,"Hey brother thanks for the advice(11B 4ID 1/8th IN) I originally was planning to just go live in the woods so that‚Äôs why this is what‚Äôs already loaded into my ruck. I‚Äôll be honest an I‚Äôm not sure the legality of this but I wanted to avoid buying any food or at least bare minimum. An maybe take a rabbit or some fish here an there an forage for other edible things nature has to offer. I‚Äôm prolly gonna leave the guitar tbh üò¢. But my original dream was purely living off the land survival then I heard of the AT. Some recent life events have left me with a burning desire to get away an to find myself an what I went out of this life. An to upgrade get a better hold on this depression.

I honestly feel waking up knowing food water shelter an atleast 12 miles is all I have to do am worry about sounds like heaven.

This may sound a little stupid or crazy but growing up I was very heavy set 280 pounds an lost my weight so I could join the military. But when I have a rucksack I‚Äôm walking is more comfortable and I feel I have a more natural gait. But thank you for the advice brother an I‚Äôll try my best to apply it."
AppalachianTrail,fisls1r,t3_f9micp,1582687401.0,"Small things I forgot. A sewing kit, solar panel wired to a usb outlet, phone battery bank, cellphone with thousands of guides downloaded an tons of books an music as well.
Two small color changing led lights (great for camp lights an can be a huge moral boost)
An my cheapo light acoustic guitar. A damn good pair of gloves there not the warmest but they fit snug not loosing much manual dexterity. An impact resistant.

Since I‚Äôll be soloing this journey thinking of trading out the tent for a bivouac. But In all honestly my tent isn‚Äôt huge to begin with."
