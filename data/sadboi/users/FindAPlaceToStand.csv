A lot of companies use similar questions, and they are fairly predictable although some interviewers like to shake things up. It's smart to be as prepared as possible."
bipolar,ezbcwn0,t3_d0o18p,1567818468.0,I like the colors. It reminds me of rushing water.
bipolar2,ezbbwwv,t3_d0ntjn,1567817772.0,"Bipolar disorder is a spectrum, and some professionals don't think it is a good idea to diagnose right away because it takes time to get to know patients. They usually have to diagnose you for insurance purposes, but some doctors are concerned about the stigma and won't put bipolar disorder on the official paperwork."
declutter,ez7waiv,t3_czyhwf,1567729257.0,"I organized the apps on my phone into folders and put the ones I use the most on the home screen. It's really satisfying even though I don't have a lot on the phone. 

I went through a lot of old papers. Mostly stuff that you have to shred or black out because it has personal information. I need to sign up for more e-statements. There is a lot of paper I am not sure how to organize or if it is worth digitizing."
trichotillomania,ez3bkaq,t1_ez0qx17,1567664276.0,"I am also nervous about it because I got a lot of attention the last time I cut my hair. I wanted to hide under a rock, and I didn't think it looked *that* different. It was only a few inches.   

There have been a lot of times people asked me if I cut my hair and I didn't know what to say, especially if I think it looks bad."
bipolar2,ez2onb3,t1_eyz7hmx,1567657418.0,"People kept telling me to sleep when I was having an episode. I knew that I needed sleep and they were trying to help, but it was frustrating that they didn't try to understand how I was feeling. I had a lot on my mind. Sometimes I was excited and sometimes I was terrified. Duh, it's hard to sleep."
BipolarReddit,ez2nnrt,t1_ez1ossx,1567657032.0,"It is hard to say because I grew up in unusual circumstances that anyone would have a hard time coping with. It was hard to accept my diagnosis because my mother thinks it lets her off the hook, and it doesn't because I clearly needed professional help as a teenager no matter what the cause was."
BipolarReddit,ez1tlp3,t3_czqqp0,1567650600.0,I like that. Maybe I will start tracking my energy level. It sounds easier than tracking my mood.
BipolarReddit,ez1onyd,t1_ez0az07,1567649470.0,"That makes a lot of sense. My mother has told me that my sleep patterns have been out of whack my whole life, although I don't know when bipolar starts. I know that doctors usually don't want to diagnose it when you are young."
BipolarReddit,ez1jwpl,t1_eyz5ud7,1567648382.0,"I have been doing okay the past year. My therapist is very optimistic. But I am trying to learn how to cope better with hypomania, depression, and OCD. I want to get a more professional job, but I am very nervous about it."
voyager,eywzmju,t3_cz4s2l,1567541493.0,"They usually don't talk about how much the characters have been through, so I liked the scene where Janeway's horrified that it seems to be just one disaster after another."
BipolarReddit,eywjuug,t3_cyvpbn,1567531159.0,"I relate a lot. My mania and psychosis also seemed to come out of nowhere. It was really scary, especially the first diagnosed episode because I had no idea what was happening, and no one else did either. The second time, I could tell that I was going downhill but I didn't know what to do. 

I still feel like it's hard to see the warning signs until it's too late. I don't have many of the textbook symptoms. I think I have always had issues with disassociation and depersonalization because of the way I was raised.   I've always had a vivid imagination."
jobs,eywefjy,t3_cz4qve,1567527570.0,I have often heard that most of us can be more productive if we work or study in short sessions of intense focus with regular breaks instead of trying to marathon it. It's normal to have some downtime if you are organized and the company isn't overworking you. Working on goal-setting and giving yourself permission to relax when you are on track might help. I know it's not easy working at home.
bipolar,eys2zg3,t3_cy8oac,1567385587.0,"I am thinking about taking pictures instead of journaling for certain things, like keeping track of food."
bipolar,eys1tz4,t3_cy8oac,1567384641.0,"I feel proud of myself because I cleaned almost my entire living space, did the laundry, and used a scrub brush on my dirty shoes. The shoes look nice now, but they still smell bad, **any suggestions?!** They are mostly plastic, and they don't last long if they are machine-washed, even on the delicate settings.

The bathroom took a lot of work, and I still need to organize everything I own better. I need to buy a decent vacuum. I got a small dresser for only $20, and it fits all my regular clothes. I'm often too lazy to fold clothes, so I feel very accomplished. It is weird how much I am actually enjoying cleaning!

A few days ago, I bought a ton of cheap, reasonably healthy meals. I'm trying not to eat out as often, but I am a picky eater.

I need to make a to-do list and do a little more cleaning."
