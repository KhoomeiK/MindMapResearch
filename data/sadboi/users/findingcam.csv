traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fimnqrf,t1_fimlepp,1582538953.0,You can have mine 💚
ftm,fimnpsv,t1_fimkvpw,1582538914.0,Yeah that’s true. I think in my case I did actually enjoy those things and I guess my personality has changed along with my understanding of gender identity as I’ve grown older
ftm,fimno4r,t1_fimju6a,1582538845.0,Ye it’s tough man
ftm,fimnnse,t1_fimgpta,1582538830.0,It just scares me because I don’t feel like I ever forced myself to be feminine or anything that’s just who I was and then when I hit puberty I realised hey there is something not right here
ftm,fimnlme,t1_fimd578,1582538742.0,Yeah it’s sad when ppl don’t I understand but it’s even sadder when they choose not to
ftm,fimnkld,t1_fimbulq,1582538700.0,I agree but I never even felt sad or miserable but I also never thought there was any other way to live
ftm,fimnhli,t1_fimea2i,1582538578.0,Thanks my guy
ftm,fimnghn,t1_fim69y1,1582538533.0,I have the same experience as you :).
ftm,fimnfsf,t1_fim66lz,1582538505.0,Ye I agree💜
ftm,fimneox,t1_filw1q5,1582538460.0,Ye I’m trying to be masculine but it’s hard because my fam don’t accept me
ftm,fimndsi,t1_filuqya,1582538422.0,Ye same
ftm,fimndfk,t1_filzbmu,1582538408.0,Yeah even the idea of wearing a dress kind of makes me cringe. It just doesn’t seem right. I should be in a suit standing with the blokes but because I used to love being a girl I never feel ‘trans enough’
ftm,fimnbl1,t1_filz1k2,1582538334.0,How did she react? I don’t think I could tell my mum that because I genuinely used to enjoy being a girl and then puberty hit me and I realised that it wasn’t right.
ftm,fimna7h,t1_fily0gl,1582538278.0,That’s exactly what I’ve done!
ftm,fimn9h4,t1_filqkba,1582538249.0,It’s tough bro
ftm,fimn8vo,t1_fily31r,1582538225.0,Yeah 100%💚.
ftm,fimn7n0,t1_filz9zm,1582538175.0,Me too brother
ftm,fimn6sk,t1_filrv4u,1582538143.0,Yeah I 100% agree. When I was really young somebody told me that it was possible to ‘change genders with an operation’ and just as a throwaway comment I said oh I want to do that. Thinking about it now I have known since I was younger but never really knew that it was a valid identity
ftm,fimn4lb,t1_filov7r,1582538055.0,Ye I 100% agree it’s like we have to prove why we are still valid if we are or used to be feminine because I’m not really feminine at all anymore yet I’m still seen as invalid by my family because I used to be so ‘girly’ and love my feminine image and self.
ftm,fimn1df,t1_filj331,1582537922.0,"I hope things get better with your mum too bro. I think we just have to work twice as hard to make the majority understand us. Once we’ve done that, we will probably be able to even explore our feminine sides knowing that it doesn’t make us any less valid."
ftm,fimmxwv,t1_filo90a,1582537784.0,I completely agree with you :)
ftm,fimmvuv,t1_filj221,1582537704.0,I hope she comes to understand it too I just know she’ll never get it if she doesn’t want to be educated about it. I also think I feel the same way as you did. Thanks
ftm,fimms4j,t1_fimm8yo,1582537554.0,Yeah I agree except I used to like being viewed as a girl or ‘one of the boys’ with my friends. One time my friend told me it was possible to ‘have an operation to change genders’ and I was about 6 and I immediately said wow I want that.

FtMpassing,fgwkqho,t3_f0p95i,1581162331.0,I don’t agree with the other comment. I think the part line is on the side and it looks good it’s just because your hair seems to be quite voluminous or like it has been blowed out maybe? I think it defo makes you look more masculine and if I saw you in the street I wouldn’t immediately think “ma’am”
