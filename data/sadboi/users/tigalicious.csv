What you just described is called male-coded and female-coded jobs. In other words, the jobs that are considered likely and/or appropriate for a particular gender.

You could easily say that waitresses are more valuable. Or you could value them equally.

I'm afraid that they *might* be attracted to me, that they *might* be the kind of person who would commit rape, and that they *might* rape me in particular. That uncertainty is why I'm afraid. And that uncertainty actually comes from *not* making assumptions about what the person's sexual orientation or intentions are."

AskFeminists,foasi4i,t1_foap5dg,1587651731.0,"There's the idea of self-defense: all pregnancies include a risk of injury or death. And people have the right to defend themselves from injury or death caused by another human, up to and including killing that human in self-defense.

There's bodily autonomy: the idea that every person owns their body and should have the right to make their own medical decisions. This means that it's unethical to force a person to host another human in their body without their consent.

There's the argument that healthcare is a human right. And abortion is a form of healthcare, so it is unethical to deny access to it for non-medical reasons. 

There's also the argument that an embryo or fetus is not yet a person, and thus has no right to life. But even if you disagree on that point, the first two arguments in this list still stand. So whether you believe abortion is the unfortunate killing of a person, or if you believe it's just another form of healthcare, access to abortion is still a human right."

AskFeminists,fo2s09p,t1_fo2otzy,1587472607.0,"As far as I understand, men are less likely to need shelter when leaving an abusive situation, because gender roles often push men to be the primary breadwinners in their families. However, there are definitely less resources than there are men in need of shelter. 

In my opinion, step one would be creating more organizations that provide emotional support and community awareness, and build from there. If we had a better network of hotlines, support groups, awareness campaigns, etc, I think those organizations would develop a better level of understanding about what other resources abused men need most."

It's actually very common for rape survivors to not know/ not acknowledge that their experience was rape until after the fact. Poor sex education is common in many places, which can lead to misunderstandings about consent. And even when consent is understood intellectually, self-blame is a common way that the human brain copes with trauma."

AskFeminists,fnvgqrf,t3_g40iag,1587292697.0,"I like her videos. As someone with a particular interest in media tropes, I thought it was a great introduction to some of them. 

Something I think a lot of people misunderstand is that each individual trope isn't like a crime against humanity or anything. And each example of the trope on its own may be explained by a plot contrivance or ""historical accuracy"" or some game mechanic or whatever. But shown in the context of all of the other examples of the same trope, you can see the connotations it has developed in a sort of cultural shorthand. 

And that's misunderstood about a lot of feminist criticism, really. Individual examples of a thing are opportunities to talk about our culture. But talking about it is not a claim that it's the worst thing in the world, or even the worst example of that thing. You can talk about video games all day without anybody saying ""how dare you care about video games when human trafficking exists"", but talk about *feminism* and video games and suddenly everyone thinks that kind of whataboutism is fair game."

On the occasions that I've made progress with someone, it has required focusing on a single issue, particularly one that they're already aware of.
