Not saying smarter just redressing your assumptions because as usual it was made from a subjective closed mind. Talk about projecting.

What I am saying is, as Pandora realised that when all else has gone only hope remains. But hope does not DO anything. If a boat is sinking and you sit there hoping it won't then you will drown. Fact.

Lol, you deny one myth but herald yours as 'fact', good job at being exactly like the religious folk you apparently hate.

If a pandemic spreads through a population, praying and being optimistic that it will just go away is a ridiculous idea. Practical measures and actions are what addresses it. 

Agreed. But if we weren't optimistic about finding practical measures that worked why would we even try? You invalidate your own og comment.

I am well aware that also being pessimistic and saying that we're doomed won't help either. But cynicism comes from realising that millions of people will get up every day and ignore the reality in favour of a smile and a positive attitude - while all around them things will get worse.

Cynicism is not pessimism. 

Moderation, middle ground and finding actual solutions. Is that so hard to accept?

Not even a complete sentence, but yes, one should always strive for a balance in all aspects of life. Of which you don't portray in your og comment.

The number of people facing acute food insecurity (IPC/CH 3 or worse) stands to rise to 265 million in 2020, up by 130 million from the 135 million in 2019, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, according to a WFP projection. The estimate was announced alongside the release of the Global Report on Food Crises, produced by WFP and 15 other humanitarian and development partners.
In this context, it is vital that food assistance programme be maintained, including WFP‚Äôs own programmes which offer a lifeline to almost 100 million vulnerable people globally.
KEY DATA

Some 265 million people in low and middle-income countries will be in acute food insecurity by the end of 2020 unless swift action is taken (source: WFP projection).

The majority of people suffering acute food insecurity in 2019 were in countries affected by conflict (77 million), climate change (34 million) and economic crises (24 million people). (source: Global Report on Food Crises).

10 countries constituted the worst food crises in 2019: ¬†Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Ethiopia, South Sudan, Syria, the Sudan, Nigeria and Haiti. (source: Global Report on Food Crises).

South Sudan had 61 percent of its population in a state of food crisis (or worse) in 2019. Six other countries also had at least 35 percent of their populations in a state of food crisis: Sudan, Yemen, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Syrian Arab Republic and Haiti. (source: Global Report on Food Crises).

These ten countries accounted for 66 percent of the total population in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) or 88 million people. source: Global Report on Food Crises).

¬†
WFP‚Äôs Chief Economist, Arif Husain said:
‚ÄúCOVID-19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread. It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock ‚Äì like COVID-19 ‚Äì to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.‚Äù


So yes it will not make it better for the people who already don't have sufficient food sources. Which isn't to say they don't need help, because they obviously do and we should actively seeks ways to help. But biblical seems to insinuate a global lack of food imo, and just makes this more scaremongering."

They can't arrest you for that either which is what separates us from total dystopian societies. Free speech with no recourse from the GOV not other idiots who act outside the judiciary boundaries. 

Take your uber reddit- anti American faggotness elsewhere."

Just kidding. Kids are super resilient, they can take a beating.

I hit my kid in the head opening the car door one time and got him pretty good. Accidents happen, and it just so happens our bodies are pretty good about dealing with them."

I used to shoot alot, the furthest I've reached out being 1400ish. But around my current area I won't be able to get that far too often, but i would still like to have the capability. Again, thank you for your time."

guns,fmxz0z8,t3_fy1eci,1586474698.0,Looks nice. How far out have you got with it?
longrange,fmxuwvy,t1_fmxtso1,1586472349.0,"Other rifles in the picture, but not necessarily just the picture as I'm assuming you currently own more than those. 

I've been thinking of building a long range system for awhile. I used to shoot alot but have been out of the loop for awhile.

Basically, what am I looking at if I'm wanting to hit 1300ish+ ? Is this 6.5 stuff good for that? Sorry for all the questions, you just seem knowledgable."
longrange,fmxolu5,t1_fmxk8kl,1586468895.0,Thank you very much. How does it compare to your others?
longrange,fmxhhzv,t1_fmwk1qa,1586465085.0,Could you spare a few minutes for a dummy like me and give the parts list for that top rifle of yours?
