mentalhealth,fqm7hob,t3_gjlgur,1589472812.0,I feel this all the time when I'm home. Especially if I'm feeling a lot of anxiety or having a panic attack. My house isn't the most comforting of places  and I feel alone when I'm here. It wasn't until I met my boyfriend and I had a panic attack when I was with him when I didn't want to go home. And then I realized to me home is a person.
AskReddit,fnc9ax2,t1_fnb9oue,1586831412.0,"My grandpa was doing really bad. He was in a home. All of the family came at once to see him.  A few of us stayed longer and were by his bed when he passed. My cousin who was on her way home with her son called us to see how he was doing moments after he passed because her little boy said ""It's okay mommy. Grandpa Great is with daddy now."" 

My cousins husband passed away two years prior."
exmormon,fn8yq4p,t1_fn8gfu9,1586753952.0,"This is probably  a lot for you right now. Especially because you are so young and never have seen other view points on the church or see it be attacked. When I was 12 I was cyberbullied and the main thing they attacked was the church. I was devastated. I had a faith crisis for a long time. I read my scriptures, went to church,  went to seminary. Exactly one year ago when I was 17 I left the church. It was devastating to me because all my friends who were mormon stopped talking to me. I never heard from my favorite leaders again. My mother said that she didn't care about how sick I got and all my depression was made up because I didn't go to church. I was devastated. 

You get to choose your own path. I chose one that was really hard for me, but is making me into a better person. If you want to choose a path that is to leave the church then I wish you safety and the best of luck. But if you want to stay in the church and live your life in the church then I have two suggestions. 1: make sure it is what you really want after fully looking at the church. 2: block notifications and don't come back to this sub. I don't mean that in a rude way but I want you to be aware that there are many harsh faith shaking stories on here. Also if it is safe talk to your parents. If not you can PM me and I can give you guidance on which path since as a teen I've came across many things and I could possibly still be in the church if it weren't for personal reasons"

AskReddit,fco6phu,t1_fco5o7u,1577825121.0,"Some things I learned that help A LOT

If you have a humidifier use it, especially when you sleep. Also. Make sure to have alarms to wake you up at night to take medicine. If you don't you're fucked in the morning 

If your ears start hurting go find heat packs and make yourself a heat pack sandwich or go take a warm shower to help. 

Find something other than your phone to keep you entertained or you will go insane. 

I started to get tired of the same old foods so try to find stuff that is sweet and stuff that is salty. Ramen, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, jello, pudding, etc.

If you notice a lot of food is getting stuck where your tonsils were take a syringe and knock it out that way.  

You are going to have terrible breath (I still have it but not as bad) be prepared for the first week for pretty much everything to taste like that breath. 

About day 8 or 9 for me it was really strange. It was if most of the pain and grogginess went away and I was able to start being a normal person who could drive again and eat more foods like chicken nuggets.
