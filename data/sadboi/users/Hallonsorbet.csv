AskReddit,fqpod7q,t3_gk2gc0,1589550874.0,"I'm not anti-vax and I've never been, but my wife was on the fence sort of with our first child. Her argument came from a place of care and also ignorance. 

For example, every child gets a shot of vitamin K at birth, to prevent a rare thing that can happen which basically is that their blood doesn't coagulate and they can get internal bleedings which can easily be fatal. Therefore all newborns get the shot. This isn't strictly a vaccine but my wife didn't want our newborn to get a shot the first thing that happened to her when she came out. She thought that the first thing a child should have is it's mother or father and a loving embrace, not a shot in the leg. I can sympathize with that idea but the doctor told us that a newborn child is so high on adrenaline and stuff that it will barely register a shot in the leg. The risk of not getting the shot far outweighed the slight discomfort of having a shot, so we agreed to have it. We got her all the vaccines after researching for ourselves and talking to our pediatrician. Same thing with our son. 

I'm glad we listened to the professionals."
