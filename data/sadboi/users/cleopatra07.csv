- be consistent with my medications and therapy (I also have a bad habit of skipping meds and ghosting my therapist from time to time... woops)

xxfitness,exbzpbo,t3_cru22v,1566140976.0,"I had a similar experience as you when I was starting out. My legs could work more but my arms were already so tired from holding the weights. Overtime though, I didn’t have this problem anymore as my upper body became stronger. So make sure you work on your upper body too so it can catch up to your lower body. Just give it time and effort. 

In the meantime, if you’re exercising your lower body for that day and your arms just won’t give, look for ways in which you could still do your workout while not letting your upper body hinder you.

Example: 
Instead of holding a dumbbell on each hand while doing squats, you could hold one dumbbell with BOTH hands and do a goblet squat instead. This can even allow you to go heavier since you’re using two hands! 

You can apply this for dumbbell stiff leg deadlifts, romanian deadlifts and calf raises as well."
xxfitness,exbyjh0,t3_cs1cil,1566140383.0,"What’s worked for me to get rid of my “bat wings” or flabby arms is working on my triceps, though I work on my whole arm (biceps and triceps) as a whole. 

Triceps exercises:
- Dumbbell tricep kickbacks *can use cable 
- Dumbbell tricep extensions *can use cable 
- Ezbar skull crushers 

Sample workout: 
Superset 15 cable tricep push downs + 15 cable tricep extensions (3 sets; for the first set do 15 reps each, for the second set do 12 reps; then third set do 10 reps; increasing weight per set) 

Bicep exercises:
- Dumbbell bicep curls (can use cable or ezbar too) 
- Dumbbell hammer curls 

Sample workout: 
Superset 10 bicep curls + 10 hammer curls (3 sets of these, increasing weight per set)

Note that exercises of any sort will only give you changes in your body if you apply progressive overload, so you can’t be doing the same sets, reps and weights all the time and expect your body to change. Once a certain exercise has become easy for you, you have to challenge your body some more by either increasing the reps, increasing the sets or increasing the weight. You can also try other exercises that target the specific muscle group you’re working on to challenge it in a different way."

Fitness,ewru2hu,t3_cp0xg1,1565713770.0,"For real though, my “cheat days” are pretty controlled ever since I started focusing on the nutrients that my body needs. I don’t deprive it of anything, but I eat healthy 80-90% of the time because I made it a habit. What helped me stick to my “healthy diet” is because I’ve made it enjoyable. The best and most sustainable diet you can have is a diet that’s healthy and enjoyable. 

On that note, I’ve learned healthy, delicious recipes and substitutes for junk cravings. But if I’m REALLY craving something, let’s say a bar of chocolate, then I’ll let myself have a piece. I’ll just adjust my other meals so I won’t do too much damage (e.g. if I had chocolate, I won’t have anything so sugary later in the day or I’ll lessen my portion for dinner so I won’t be in a caloric surplus). 

My “cheat days” are usually on the weekends. I’ll do intermittent fasting so I can eat larger, more calorie dense meals later. Then I’ll enjoy some wings or ice cream. But what works for me may or may not work for you, so you have to observe and experiment: 
1. Are you restricting yourself of certain vitamins and minerals that leads you to bingeing on your cheat days? Are you on an aggressive caloric deficit? Perhaps this may be triggering your bingeing. 
2. How’s your sleep? Stress levels? Sleep deprivation and chronic stress may lead to bingeing. 
3. Have you recently changed your diet too drastically? Perhaps you got used to eating these certain (junk) foods and recently just committed to sticking to a healthier diet. Perhaps take it one day at a time? It takes time to build a habit, after all. Perhaps you can find healthy substitutes and/or try lessening your portions and frequency of these “cheat meals” overtime."

Fitness,ewrsr0r,t3_cp31vw,1565712946.0,"The way your body distributes fat is genetic so if your butt is mostly composed of fat, then it will get smaller. However, since the butt is a muscle too, you can make it bigger by building it through strength training. You can do this with exercises that target the glutes directly like hip thrusts and glute bridges. Other supplementary exercises that aren’t as direct as the aforementioned exercises but still works the glutes are split squats, wide stance squats, fire hydrant, glute kickbacks, etc. 

I recommend checking out Bret Contreras as he is one of the spearheaders of the glute building movement! You can also check out his workout program Strong Curves (there’s also a subreddit of this) that focuses on specifically building the glutes."

beautytalkph,evbvk8w,t3_civmwr,1564396621.0,"I do intermittent fasting which saves me a lot of time in the morning. My routine usually goes like this: 

- Wake up 
- Check my agenda for the day 
- Make my bed
- Light stretching 
- Drink 2 glasses of water 
- Pee 
- Shower (I wash my body lang since I shower the night before and my hair is clean naman since I sleep with aircon) and wash my face 
- Tooth brush 
- Dry myself off, put moisturizer and sunscreen
- Dress up 
- Leave the house
- During commute, I put on tinted moisturizer, light setting powder, brows and lip tint (having eyelash extensions saves me a lot of time too hehe). I also put lotion and perfume during commute. If I want more coverage that day, I’ll pack my concealer and spot conceal blemishes and my under eyes. 
^ This is convenient for me since my commute takes around an hour. 

All in all, my routine before I leave the house takes me around 40 mins to an hour. 

I used to take two hours to get ready in the morning, so this was a major improvement from back then. Some changes I made that helped me get ready faster were: 
- Preparing the things I need the night before 
- Intermittent fasting
- Showering thoroughly the night before 
- Simplifying my makeup routine by using multipurpose products (lip and cheek tint, brow liner that can be used as an eyeliner also, use mascara as an eyebrow mascara/tint put it LIGHTLY) 
- Using my commute time efficiently

*For my skincare, I do my actives at night since that’s when I have the most time anyway. So face wash, moisturizer and sunscreen during the day, then at night, I’ll do BHA/AHA. 

*I have acne prone oily skin but with this simplified regimen my skin has become normal and clear. Exercising regularly and having a 90% clean diet has helped me too. I also make sure to get adequate sleep and take supplements at night when I need to (magnesium when I’m super stressed or when I feel I’m deficient in it, fish oil since I don’t eat a lot of fish, melatonin when I’m having a hard time sleeping pa rin, other vitamins which varies from person to person etc)

*If I have to do a full beat face, I’ll either wake up earlier to give myself more time or I’ll strategize how to do my makeup faster. For example, I like to do my base at home since I’m more meticulous with this and it’s more difficult for me to do (foundation + contour + brows + liner) then continue the rest (the easiest) during commute (blush + highlight + lips). Additionally, when applying my moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, foundation, concealer — I’ll stand in front of an electric fan to dry my face faster between steps."
