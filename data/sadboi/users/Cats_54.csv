AmItheAsshole,evioupm,t3_ck37ji,1564546429.0,NTA - You’ve communicated your concern and she’s listened but made her own decision.  However if you feel this uneasy keep a close eye on her and if you feel like it gets to a point of abuse or something else very serious contact an outside source and get help from but only if you know it’s getting bad.

However you should’ve been notified prior to the incident.  Both parties should’ve handed it differently.  I think the best course of action is to communicate with your parents your concerns with the situation and let them communicate theirs and go from there."
