They give me an oxygen tube, and I remember looking at the class, and then really the next thing I remember is waking up. I thought that they hadn‚Äôt done the surgery yet, then I looked at the clock and saw that over 30 minutes had passed. 

I had the weirdest feeling that my tongue was out, so I touched my lips to see what was going on with my tongue, and one of the nurses grabbed my hand and said, ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt touch, don‚Äôt touch.‚Äù Which was very frustrating because I was sure _my tongue was not in my mouth_. Spoiler alert, it was, I just couldn‚Äôt feel a single thing.

They put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me out to my mom‚Äôs car and I was _so_ pissed because I wasn‚Äôt giggly or goofy at all. In my opinion, the surgery had been pointless. 

I then went home and slept pretty much all day on the couch, and my dogs curled up with me to make sure I felt better"
