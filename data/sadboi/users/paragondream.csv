I tried to be brave but I could not do it. I literally felt like I was gonna die so I had to say stop, I can’t do it. I kept apologizing and I cried but they were really, really nice. They helped me to not be so embarrassed or to feel like I had failed, I tried again later with medicine and I was able to do it. You can do it with the medicine. It will be fine. Think positive, keep your eyes close and imagine a wonderful dream in your mind."

I can’t do casual. I need to honesty and security, sincerity...even in an AP, just as much as I would in any relationship. My soul can never feel at ease being so intimacy with someone who I’m not close to and growing closer as time goes by. If I as that he thinks I’m indicating I expect us to blossom into a full time commuter, traditional relationship. I said 100 times that’s not it. It’s so frustrating but I have such powerful feelings about him. It’s very difficult to completely shut them down. I’ve never felt like this and it really sucks. 💔"

adultery,fft1nal,t1_fap6lzt,1580202248.0,"It’s just almost impossible to have sex w/ a different person. For women like us, we make emotionally investments, feel very deeply and getting into an affair likely was a very difficult, mind and soul bending action to take that we feel extremely guilty for. I know that’s how it’s been for me but man oh man, these people are masters of manipulation and once they know there’s an attraction we are like prey to them. 

They’ll convince us there’s some special connection, that we are soul mates or some BS. Mine even told me that I was his “good karma”. Like I’m so special I am his gift for having been such a good person and him having endured such a hard life. Karma doesn’t come around in the form of an adulterous mistress, give me a break! But I fell for it, hook, line and sinker like a complete idiot and I’m not a fool. I’ve acted like one but I’m just very compassionate, to a fault. Psychopaths, Sociopaths and Narcissists LOVE to fuck with compassionate, loyal women. We are catnip for them."
adultery,fft16u1,t1_fbf8yh5,1580201566.0,"I’m in the same boat and can’t bring myself to do it. Once I sleep w/ someone I’m committed to that person mind, body and soul until the connection has absolutely been severed w/ no uncertainty. 

With my daughter’s Dad, when our relationship disintegrated, I didn’t even begin to be able to fathom “stepping out” even though he slept on the couch and there was zero intimacy for months. I confided a little bit in one guy online who was pursuing me heavily and reluctantly, regretfully gave the guy my number but felt guilty as hell about it. 

It’s twisted. Married men, especially w/ a specific psychological profile...women too I’m guessing seek out people like that to have their affairs with. The smart ones won’t just go around fucking a bunch of easy whores. It’s much more challenging and less risky to convince a “good girl” who they know will be dedicated and susceptible to psychological warfare tactics to fuck them. Once they’ve got control, they KNOW we won’t just go fuck someone else and will instead sit around waiting for them to finally validate us in some way that’s beyond just sexual. 

Also we are the ones who have the ability to provide mind blowing passionate, sensual, loving sexual experiences that are far more interesting than robot type sex with a hooker and they really love that. It’s sick and it’s psychopathic in nature because they have zero regard for the other person’s soul. 

So yeah, it’s not as easy as just being able to go fuck someone else. If we could, we’d probably end up then falling for that new person and being just as fucked up or even more so, guaranteed."
adultery,ffrs9s8,t3_eanuu8,1580164693.0,"He has a very subtle way of doing something that ends up making me feel like I am totally an obsessed person who is just worthless without his approval and attention. I’ve never, ever been so confused or so low in my life. Even though I can easily say goodbye, see the light, I always end up going back to trying to maintain a connection. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. Other than a couple of weird, drunken one night stands when I was younger that made me feel totally gross, I’ve always held out for sex until I felt it was right and had relationships where a mutual foundation was formed. I’ve never had casual sex and I explained to him over and over that this is completely out of my comfort zone, against my morals and that if I don’t feel like we have some trust, a friendship and good communication it will fuck my head up. I’ve literally begged him for rules and to talk to me and he either ignores it, acts amused by it or says, yeah ...oh of course, we will make some rules ASAP (never fkn happens.) I will get so sad and then furious but ultimately just blame myself and think “oh well, he works too much so he doesn’t have time to make an effort, it should be my job, I shouldn’t be so demanding, it’s my fault anyway because I flirted big time, gave into the sex without doing that first so I was stupid and even deserve to be miserable for being a horrible person. He’s never shown me even a glimpse of empathy. I am constantly oozing empathy for him, getting all emotional, fkn crying even though I’ve never been a person to cry over men at all. I was really drawn to him. The chemistry literally terrified me to the point that I was scared to be around him, I mean not just nervous but a complete wreck if I had to be anywhere near him. Yes I was extremely attracted to him but I’ve been attracted to plenty of people in my life who I never felt like THAT around. I did really want to flirt with him and I even thought, well maybe we can kiss and just kinda see what this feeling is and why because it’s so intense. I never thought we actually would kiss though. It was more like a fantasy that I didn’t think would happen. I did not plan to have sex with this man. I didn’t picture having sex with him, that picture never came into my mind. It was like a grade school crush where your mind doesn’t take it to that place but being around the person just makes you feel so weird and so different from what you normally feel that it makes you extremely curious, clumsy, excited but also terrified. When we kissed I couldn’t even form one coherent sentence afterwards. I truly couldn’t. I’d try to speak and just blah blah blah would come out of my mouth. He was totally calm, cool and just smiling and laughing at me. He wasn’t nervous at all but his state of arousal was more intense than anything I’ve ever seen. He was so excited, happy and turned on that it was shocking, disorienting to have someone be THAT excited to have physical contact with me. Way above what would be normal even in a circumstance where a person was very turned on and inspired. Really hard to explain but overwhelming, practically paralyzing. I was hugging him, kinda holding myself up by hugging him and burying my face in his neck trying to take deep breaths and calm down when he just started trying to pull my clothes off. We were in the kitchen and he pushed me up against the counter and was pulling my jeans down very assertively and pushing his hand down into my V. I said, omg WAIT...what do you think your doing? A kiss doesn’t mean guaranteed sex - I’m not ready for that with you, I can’t. Every protest I made he would just grin at me and go “mmm-hmm , yeah ok - right.” I pulled my pants back up and buttoned them again at least 6 times and I would say “just please calm down - wait a minute” and try to just stand there and hug him for a minute but he kept ripping them down again and trying over and over to try to perform oral sex on me which I VERY clearly objected to and pushed him away multiple times - finally even pulled him up and put both hands on his face, said “please look at me and listen!” He laughs a little. I said “no means NO. OK? Do you understand? I don’t want you to do that. Please stop.” He grins, nods, “oh ok...haha.”  Yes I was stuttering, stammering, freaking out but still explaining this wasn’t something I could do, apologizing and expressing regret for flirting and letting him clearly know casual sex isn’t something I can do and especially with him, that to even consider it we would really have to have a serious discussion, build trust with a friendship and lay out some definitive ground rules. He agreed, oh yeah of course and then kept at it. I kept trying to just downgrade it to a tight hug and kinda and he kept pushing and pulling me all over the kitchen and then he told me that “we have to - are you kidding? What do you mean we can’t? With allll this energy we have no choice, we’re going to - so are you taking me upstairs now?” I did give in and let him go upstairs with me where we pushed and pulled and kissed with me trying to pull away from the kissing but then giving into it because I didn’t hate it, my body was really responding to his touch but my mind was determined to fight it and the attempts at oral sex went on for another 45 minutes before I finally told him that’s just an act that feels too intimate and vulnerable to me and I can only let someone I love and trust do that so he eventually gave up on that part. We were rolling on the floor and with him moving me all around the room (not violently but very insistently). Finally he just kinda guided me up on the bed, pulled my clothes off from the waste down (I’m going omg, omg. omg. What are we doing? Omg omg oh no). I can’t say I wasn’t sexually aroused because I very much wa and I was and am extremely attracted to him. I even took his shirt off, ripped mine up and pushed my bra down then pulled him into me so we would be touching skin to skin. Well and then next thing I know we are having this very, very intense sex, then it’s done and he’s falling asleep on top of me and just stayed inside of me in a close embrace, breathing with same exact rhythm for a long time. When he left I was immediately freaking out. That was over 5 months ago and I am still freaking out.  As a very young lady, who got into abusive and controlling relationships I never felt like I had absolutely no value or self worth. He’s the only man who’s ever made me feel that way, practically effortlessly. Even if a person would get angry or be very mean to me, they would always come back and say, I’m sorry....I was so wrong. I don’t want you to leave. I love you. This is so different. This is making me feel like a worthless whore and a whore who’s not even wanted unless I apologize correctly and play some psychological cat and mouse game that is such a mind fuck I literally feel like I am going crazy. I can’t figure out, is it me, is it him? I’ll apologize for being emotional, tell him I totally understand his position. Think we have fixed it. He will ignore me for almost a week and I’ll just tank emotionally then every single time I am just about to finally pull the plug he will send some weird text message that basically says he’s not mad at me, he doesn’t get mad, he only has capacity for positive energy and my behavior wasn’t “that” bad, it barely effected him because (implied: he’s so superior to me that he’s not susceptible to such primitive emotions). I’ve got to get myself out of this. I can’t believe I ended up here. I go from being positive he’s a psychopath (he’s a textbook case according to all the literature) to believing the whole thing is a result of me being intellectually and emotionally inferior to him and if I would just try harder and be smarter, it would all be cool....and HOW could I have embarrassed myself by expressing such extreme emotions to him when he is so calm, cool and collected? I’m an idiot. He’s amazing. I don’t even deserve him. I’m lucky he doesn’t hate me. It’s pathetic and I resemble someone I don’t even recognize. I’ve never been so confused about anything. I really can’t believe I allowed myself to get in the position. It is my fault and not his because I’m an adult. I know that. I just wish I could understand and quit feeling so awful about myself. I fully have to admit that when we have sex now its amazing and I want it bad. I’m different than I’ve ever been sexually, very uninhibited. I pretty much literally scream and just go wild but weird part is, I never actually climax but I come close and this may sound crazy but his orgasm gives me an emotional climax. I am so turned on by how turned on he is that I feel like I’ve become some nympho that’s addicted to satisfying him and I think knowing that the sex with me is the best he’s ever had is very validating and makes me feel special. Sex with someone who usually is nothing but calm, in control and to have the ability to completely blow their mind is addictive. Sorry. I know this is crazy long and a big fat mess full of typos and horrible grammar but I must have really needed to just get all that out. I didn’t know it was coming. 😳🙏"

PurplePillDebate,fer9rp6,t3_eq4yoi,1579351510.0,"I’ve wanted to wait at least for a while because if there was no higher level connection I didn’t have any interest in vetting for sexual compatibility. Usually if you really connect to someone profoundly the sex will be good and some people are just more likely to let down their inhibitions, opening the door to really good or amazing sex when they know someone. I’ve found out men who have had very long term relationships with a small number of women are WAY better in bed than men who have been with a bunch of women short term because many people are much more likely to have been adventurous and profoundly intimately sensual, have good sexual communication, and willingness to explore and learn with a partner they loved and had a bond with than someone they just banged to test sexual compatibility. Most people take a little while to establish a really significant intimate bond. Part of the fun is discovering each other and evolving, exploring sexually. Some people take longer to warm up and get comfortable and really get into some intense and amazing level sex and can’t get that into it with a stranger. It can be really exciting when it’s someone brand new and hot but the really, really good sex IMO is always nurtured by connecting on other levels too. It’s imperative for me. You can always teach people things too. I’ve been surprised at how significantly the quality and style of the sex changes over time. If someone has the same exact type of sex with everyone every time they’re lame in bed from my point of view or maybe they’re just a one trick pony. I also really don’t want to have a bunch of different men up on me or in me. I want to stay clean and not be all hammered by a multitude of partners. Quality over quantity for my vote. I know a lot of people have the vetting philosophy but it’s not my preference."

adhdwomen,fep2u9e,t3_eq0m4z,1579310887.0,"Omg this is amazing! I have literally been “dreaming” about something like this. My thoughts move so quickly all the time and I can’t keep up with typing them and also my friends/family are annoyed and exhausted with my painfully long text messages trying to explain all my thoughts, feelings and experiences. I’m annoyed with myself but I feel so passionately about wanting to express myself and communicate after years and years of being afraid to communicate because I thought I would be judged, misunderstood and overwhelm others with my intense, colorful thoughts process. So several months ago I transitioned over to making all of these voice recordings. Many of them were me trying so hard to communicate with a man I had/have intense feelings for. I’ve always cringe at the sound of my own voice - just could not stand the sound it and a severe public speaking phobia. I was able to do it though. It was scary and I talked for way too long, I have some that are a dang hour long and a lot of babbling. Well tbh, the guy really didn’t even ever listen to any of them. He never commented or replied to anything I said on any of them. Duh me but anyway I began to really review them and realized what I was doing subconsciously was ultimately creating a very elaborate audio journal, my life story, my love stories, jokes, inhibition free expressions of all of my experiences, hopes, dreams, fears, failures, successes. It’s a very colorful collection. As I began to communicate and share with other friends (people who actually listened to them and replied 🙂)I kept having them tell me I was hilarious, that I needed to have a podcast, YouTube channel, write books, screen plays. It was very encouraging and kind of exciting. It also helped to ease the pain of feeling completely ignored and unappreciated by the man I was so often actually pouring my heart out to as my original source of inspiration. My first true heart-break even though I am a grown woman who is a mother. Yes, it sounds crazy and it has truly been one of the strangest periods of time in my whole life. It was the first time I ever let my walls down and truly opened my heart and soul up to any man, allowed myself to be entirely vulnerable. He didn’t have any appreciation for it and as far as I can tell, he just wanted the intensity of the sexual experience so I really ended up feeling like a a complete fool and a failure in endeavors of love. Very painful. It really shook me. I had never been so brutally rejected before. He didn’t even have to courage to overtly reject me though. He just refused to communicate with me but would keep me hanging on just enough to show up for intermittent sexual adventures. I’ve known that I was going to have to walk away for quite a while but yesterday I actually found the strength to really tell him goodbye and not in an emotionally reactive or spiteful way. I have all these VR’s but they are a mess so I’ve been wanting something like this so badly because they rally are an intense, emotional, honest, sometimes very sad and slam risks hilarious, colorful audio journal that I think is kind of special."
adultery,fazdmyr,t1_faz8699,1576415069.0,"Omg - Wow. Are we sleeping with the same person? Lol I’ll be like I’m totally 😎, I’m fine. I got this.

Then I’m like nope. Don’t care. Not gonna text him back. Not doing it! 5 minutes later I’m like, aweeee the way he communicates in hieroglyphics is so cute. All texting him back. 🤦‍♀️ I’m just overthinking. I should lighten up. Yes honey, you can totally come over for an hour tomorrow, wreck my mind and then leave me in the dirt, guessing and freaking out. Sounds lovely. What time, 8:30 am? 😁❤️☀️ Ugh!

adultery,faylzo4,t3_eanuu8,1576402968.0,"Wow. I sure can relate. I am F. I’ve never had an affair w/ a married man and I have warded off many attempts. It’s just never been my style and I wasn’t interested. I know it’s lame or whatever but monogamy actually is good for me. However I can’t stand it when a partner gets all codependent and needy. I want some autonomy. 

In September I ended up in the most strange and unexpected situation I could have ever imagined. Ended up sleeping with someone who is married. 
Well let me tell ya, the sex has been hot. I think we have done it like 5 times now and every time except the most recent I literally feel like stepping off the golden afterwards. My head is FUCKED UP. And the sex is hot but also, I never climax. 

It’s cool to share my life but I don’t want to sacrifice my identity to become a ball and chain or to have a ball and chain weighing me down so I convinced myself I could try this out and as long as some strict ground rules were laid out maybe it could be an adventure to evolve my sexuality. 

It’s never happened. No rules. Just me freaking out and bouncing around and stressing out, sacrificing my peace for a couple hours of smiles, sweat and then mental mayhem. 

He hasn’t even given me an orgasm!!! The sex is interesting. This last time he almost did, right on the verge a number of times but he would intentionally switch positions just to drag it out. I was like wtf? I was almost there (again) and he’s like, yeah I know. 😏 

For gods sake I finally just ended up faking it so it would end cuz I was exhausted after two 1/2 hours, drenched in sweat and 4, 5 “almost” ending in “ok, guess not”. 

Good times? Wtf? Ridiculous.  I’m passionate and I enjoy being sexually adventurous but with boundaries and integrity. I feel like people should do what is right for them but I am also pretty taken aback by people who intentionally seek to be home wreckers. As I am learning, there are many. 

I’m not stupid but I feel as though I’ve had blinders on or been naive. I have honestly never pursued anyone in my life. I’ve been the chased, not the chaser. Now I’m chasing this guy who doesn’t give a shit about me but I am sure, finds me quite amusing.

I’m like you too and I don’t think I’m “all that” or anything. I feel fairly average. It’s just weird. I’m beginning to feel like a total idiot. I wonder, are most people just dead set on sleeping with as many people as they can as often and as frequently as possible? 

The most recent time, the sex was almost flawless (almost) but it was the first time I didn’t completely flip my lid afterwards. Well, it was just a delayed effect. It was 6 days ago and for the last 3 I’m going out of my mind. I’m up, I’m down. I justify it. I convince myself it’s ok then I shift to feeling horribly guilty, used and unappreciated. It’s a nightmare. The last three months I’m walking around in a daze with my emotions all over the place, confused as F. Totally disappointed in myself. 

One minute I can compartmentalize, the next I’m about to cry thinking of what could happen to his family and to my quiet, peaceful life if it was to come out.

There’s also a really dark vibe and undeniable undertone of something being really off. He won’t communicate and I can’t stop communicating- seeking validation, hoping by some miracle that he will care enough to comfort me or guide me through the murky water. 

It’s never going to happen, ever. He’s just going to push to get as much sex in as he can, if and when he can and use me as an object of amusement. I’ve “broken up” like 6 times now, at least but he sucks me back in again. No doubt he gets off on the power trip of knowing he has caused such a powerful emotional response in me.

I keep asking myself....wtf is wrong with me? Why am I doing this? I ask him to answer questions. I tell him my secrets that I’ve never even told LTRP’s. It’s honestly pathetic. I am so much more valuable than to reduce myself to this BS. 

So yeah, it IS absolutely a drug. May as well just go smoke some dang crack. It’d be less complicated and confusing. I agree with you 💯. Just do not do it if you value your sanity and emotional health. I wish I could rewind time and take it all back. It’s sick. 💔 Unless you just don’t feel emotions and can settle on being satisfied with pure physicality or you can switch feelings on and off like a light switch, bad idea...horrible. 👎 🙏"

adultery,f7ywnrz,t1_f7ph0ns,1574101829.0,"Interesting point of view. I’m not looking down on anyone. I’m just surprised that anyone views scoring with a man who’s in a relationship as some type of trophy they’ve won. 

The reason I know it’s so easy is because I’ve been turning it down for my whole entire life and saying “not scoring here sir, go home to your wife.” 

I’ve actually developed long term platonic friendships with married men who initially sought to F me because they weren’t bad people and I wasn’t judging them but rather than slap them across the face and be like “oh my!” I had intelligent, analytical, open minded conversations with them and didn’t drop my panties. 

If you don’t believe in monogamy then don’t freaking get married and take vows saying you’ll be monogamous. If you believe monogamy isn’t natural, cool...be honest about it, communicate, seek out other people who agree with you. Enter into into intimate relationship with full disclosure and find ways to be in an alternative style relationship with some integrity rather than lying and sneaking around. 

Just be real. 

Most people can respect real. Lying and pretending you’re something you’re not isn’t good imo. 

Sometimes people get married and they intend to honor their vows but later on, things get complicated. I understand that. I don’t understand getting married and making vows knowing full well you have no intention of honoring the vows but just lying and being fake. 

And I don’t understand intentionally targeting men who are in relationships and manipulating them into fucking you just because you get off on the rush and feel validated by getting fucked by men who are supposedly committed. Low self esteem much? 

There’s nothing negative or judgmental about me sweetheart. In fact, I am the opposite of that. I’m also not afraid to lay hard truths out on the table. 🤷‍♀️ Downvote the fuck out of me for being honest. Do you really think I give a fuck? Lol 😂"

adultery,f7oru5i,t1_f7o0bbw,1573932813.0,"Probably missed a lot of STD’s too. 🤦‍♀️ Imo, AP seeking shouldn’t be a sport. If you wanna fuck for sport don’t freaking make marriage vows saying you’ll be faithful, so help you god. 

When sane people with integrity end up in AP relationships it’s supposed to be because of extenuating circumstances or a consensual agreement that even though they made vows they are BOTH wanting to pursue an alternative sex life because that’s what they enjoy. Yeah once in while something crazy happens that god smacks you but this....?

Yuck. 

Being a straight husband thief or getting married just to put on a front and fucking any whore you can just for sport, if you can, because you can is a display of absolutely no character or integrity and quite frankly, it’s pathetic.

adultery,f7oqwsu,t3_dx7w3d,1573932231.0,"I get that this is an adultery forum, but why exactly are you so excited at being successful scoring with men who are already in relationships? That’s actually not something I would have ever intentionally sought out, let alone tried to master the art of. 

My AP situation happened because...well, even though I always thought people who said, “didn’t plan it - just happened” was a bunch of bullshit.....I did not plan it and it just happened. It’s actually fucking me up. 

I’ve turned down or shut down at least a dozen married men (conservative estimate) because I don’t want to wreck a home and I can’t imagine viewing scoring married men as some type of sport to succeed at (its sooo easy). 

It’s difficult for me to grasp the concept of a woman who would make that a goal or her mission in life. The idea of being a home wrecker or betraying another woman by sleeping with her SO just for the glory of it makes me sick to my stomach. 

That’s actually why I’m here. To try and understand more. I’m not trying to be rude and I don’t want to judge you but I am more than a little “wtf?” about your post and you’re SO excited. Why? What is it about stealing and giving it away for free that is such a thrill? 
Typically alcoholics will show up to an open bar. That’s not exactly being a successful bar owner. I’m giving it away! I’m successful! Huh? 🤔 

It makes me feel like I should be in jail. Also, again I really am not meaning to sound like a bitch but this is just pure honesty and that’s kinda why we are all on an anonymous forum, so we can be honest about everything (maybe I’m wrong?)....

But yeah, men are very primal and a man who may have otherwise not strayed, if you fucking throw yourself at him and shove your pussy in his face, all HERE! Have it! Yes, a lot of men are going to instantly start thinking with their small head (primal not cerebral). 

After they fuck you and you’re all HAPPY and surprised, then what? What’s the take away? What did you win exactly that’s so exciting and surprising? Why do you target married men and think of getting them to give info fucking you (abc’s, easy as 123?) as some type of miraculous victory?"

I actually am gonna stay for a minute just in case anyone needs a virtual hug, cuz god damn this forum is heavy AF.  🤗 

Why are we even here? I mean idk about y’all but I desperately and sincerely tried to seek someone, anyone who could just help me through this hell. 

Someone Who authenticity WANTED to JUST help another human soul who was in pain, struggling through the aftermath of the confusion of having someone manipulate the fuck out of you...so they could fuck you. 

GUESS what? Hard truth. Truth usually is. People will pretend do listen, care a bit, especially if you’re very authentic and transparent, cuz that makes you special. 

In the grand scheme, all anyone in this sick, twisted little corner is EVER gonna do is pretend to care and then jump right to “whaddya look like?” “Wanna fuck ooh download this and that so you can fuck up your phone or computer, whatever, wanna fuck, wanna I’m your friend. Are you hot or not? 😋 😋 😋 

Sorry, not sorry. 

🤢 

This is only a place to come if you want cheap sex, a virtual singles bar/swingers club. 

Send/ exchange raunchy pics and shit.

I will never be that desperate no matter how 💔 is by some sociopath AP. 

If you want anything close to resembling sage advice gtfo, ASAP. Just sayin’ being honest, as nobody on these creepy forums (or in life 😞?) is apparently able to do authentically.

They’ll fake it like hell and be patient enough to wade through 3 or 4 of your heartbroken cries for help before it shifts to “yo ill fuck ya. Wanna fuck? Pics?

Have you tried to get adventurous with her? How old are your children? Sometimes women simply have hormonal fluctuations after bringing beautiful souls into the world via shredding our bodies and we need a minute to heal so we can get back on point.

If you can knock her up and expect her to sacrifice everything to procreate with you, cuz obviously she is MADLY in love with you, dedicated to you and takes care of you, flawlessly? Hello, kiddo?

Fuck that AP. She doesn’t give a shit. She’s just playing. Your SO would probably take a bullet for you. Sounds like it? Consider shifting your energy? People forget these things and go straight to outsourcing cuz they’re bored and being lazy and shit. 

Do you REALLY wanna risk losing your SO over an AP who apparently ain’t even a very good AP? 

If my AP was in that situation I would be begging him to let me help him and seriously stressing, worrying about him and hurting for him. Just a guess but I don’t think your AP is anywhere close to that, Your SO is so obviously dedicated to you.
