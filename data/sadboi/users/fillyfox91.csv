Dentistry,fmbt95m,t3_ftqd69,1585932793.0,"I wish you was near me. I have rang endless dentists that won't see me, I am on a very high dose of prescription painkillers that aren't helping. I can't remember when I last ate or wasn't sick from the pain. I understand that we have very limited ppe but when I have to keep ringing the NHS for help and then being sent to A&E I'm surely putting more of a strain on them, than if someone would kindly just pull my tooth out. I have cried to dentists, begged them to help me, offered to pay any amount just so I'm not in pain."
