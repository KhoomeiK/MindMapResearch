Extremely hard with any addiction to rid yourself of it. The "" sickness""is what keeps u coming back. You have spent a great deal of time avoiding that ""sickness"" but congratulations on your sobriety reguardless relapse or not. 
  I've been clean from opiates 5 years now and I know the struggles you face regardless of how we got our dope, regardless of what we did or didn't do , opiates  are strong thing and I was diagnosed bipolar 4 years ago. It was hard for me to accept and I wanted to blame it on a drug-induced bipolar but once this road began I realized I needed help. I needed peoples support .  I need  counseling I need to gain control and sometimes it's very hard to do. You're going to go places in your mind that are pleasant but always know you are not alone no matter if you literally are at the time. It is fantastic you have a counselor stick with them be honest take your medicine on time every time and if those thoughts of suicide sounds fantastic, just know this , you'll be killing the ones that love you as well you'll be leaving your burden upon them and  let those thoughts pass. You have a strong will you have done wonderful things and giving up your opiates only made you stronger I am here all the time if you ever need a friend.  I am bipolar , I am a recovering addict, I am extremely lonely, and  I have never relapsed, and I am your friend."
