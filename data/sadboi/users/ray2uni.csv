BPD,fjfmq76,t3_fcrfpo,1583295061.0,"I had someone close to me with Borderline, this sounds like something they said sometimes. I dunno the details of your situation, but the person i had close to me had created a completely wrong reality in there head and they believed there version 100%, even showing the undeniable proof, like quoting/screenshotting text messages that proved there version of events wasn't true wasn't enough to change there mind, and generally just made them extremely defensive and angry. 

They always thought they were the type of person that could admit to there faults, but even that was true, whenever they ""admitted to something they did wrong"", it always included a reason after it that it wasn't there fault, like ""sorry i hit you, but you know i really don't like when you...., and you continue to do it.... etc etc""
And even after apologizing, they'd never stop doing whatever it was.

Even this womans own sister knew she was definitely in the wrong. She completely created a false reality in her head that she 100% believed. And no amount of proof could make her think otherwise.

Like i said i dunno your situation, but from my experience its definitely possible for someone with Borderline to have a completely wrong view of reality and not be able to see it.

I understand this isn't the sort of reply you wanted, you wanted validation that the way you think is correct, which it might be. I have been close to a BPD that has created false realities though, and i truly think she believed her story, she had absolutely no idea she was wrong and she hated being shown hard evidence that went against her version of events."
