I didn't know anything was seriously wrong until he said this and now I'm crashing on the couch till I find a new job and save up enough to leave and seriously trying not to kill myself, he's been leaving early mornings and coming home at 1 am every day.

SuicideWatch,fblteko,t3_edudr0,1576969794.0,"I haven't had the worst life, but for me it's been pretty horrible. I grew up poor with family all around that were drug addicts and violent. I was sexually abused as a young child by a cousin. I recently recovered a repressed memory of my brother doing the same a few years after the cousin. When I became a teenager (13) I became interested in a boy that my mother sheltered. He was a few years older and also a drug addict, all around the same as the horrible family I'd grown up with. After about a month of thinking I was in love, I said something that set him off and that started a 3 year period of being sexually abused, mentally tormented and physically hurt. Because I thought I was protecting my mother and brother I endured it and when he got bored he left. My mother didn't know the full scope of what had happened, but when she found some old notes she dragged me into the police station and I sat being screamed at by police officers for over two hours saying that I was lying and girls my age just lie about rape so we don't get in trouble. Because of the trauma and overall fear of people, I dropped out of high school. We had to move, lost the house to the city. Some time after we moved into a kind of crappy apartment. My brother moved a girlfriend he had in with us, where she abused him. He ended up snapping and a few months in he started becoming the abuser not just to her, but to my mother and me as well. His next girlfriend became the newest victim and we ended up moving again. I was 19 when we moved to a whole new state and promises of a better happier life lasted for a few weeks. I was 20 when I was able to get a job, it was my escape. One of my coworkers became my boyfriend and when I realized my mother wouldn't abandon my brother with me and my boyfriend offered to live together a few months from being together I didn't hesitate. I cut off all contact from my brother, barely kept in touch with my mother and 4 years of the best time of my life with my boyfriend later, he broke up with me because of my mental health. He said he didn't want to take care of me and that I need to find motivation. All the time I was with him I thought I was steadily improving, I was trying my hardest because I had something and someone to try for. Not only did I want to have a happy life for me, but I wanted it to be with him and make him happy too. But he won't change his mind about us and I have never felt more broken and done and tired of fighting and done with trying to find a happy life. I've almost committed suicide one time in my life and that was years ago amidst the fighting when I lived with my family, but now. I really think I am done. I'm in so much pain and there's no one. There's nothing strong enough for me to focus on to keep going. I think I'm just a few days away from it now. I get waves of wanting to work at it and find a job, save up and live, but the rest of the time it's nonstop pain. I just don't want to hurt anymore. I don't want these memories. With my boyfriend I started to believe life was worth it and I was worth it, but he was the last thing I had. I don't care about anything anymore but stopping the hurt."
