YouShouldKnow,fr344e7,t1_fr2v6l4,1589849556.0,I was in an ER waiting for a doctor to stitch my tendons back together. There was a child that was crying and some commotion. They finally came in and explained that the child I was hearing had a cut above it's eye and the mother was helping keep the child still so they could apply liquid stitches. I guess the mother decided halfway through she couldn't hold the child down and now the poor thing had it's eyelids stuck together. I felt bad for the child. I was also high at due to a medication error where one nurse cave me a darvocet and about 30 minutes later another one gave me a lortab. I was fine with waiting out of sympathy and a general lack of anxiety at that point.

It also works when the virus can't mutate. They've started seeing it cause rapid clots in the brains of people in their 30s and 40s that only have one common denominator and that's being infected. It's attacking multiple organs rather than just the lungs. Scientist and doctors aren't advising to ""get it over with quickly"" because we'll have to dig mass graves like they did in Italy and they're currently doing in Brazil. Even in a county in GA they ran out of body bags and they're freezing bodies because the coroner's office and the funeral homes are over run. So if you don't mind throwing you're family member in a mass grave with a bunch of other infected bodies this is definitely the way to go.

Often times so much of the families energy goes into helping a family member that needs assistance that family members that don't need as much assistance feel like they aren't heard.

It's made me understand that the reason my son loves me so much is because I treat him well and the reason I want away from her isn't because I'm heartless, but because she's sincerely mean to me. I tried to get her to love me. Then I tried to be bigger person. Finally I decided to be nice to me and just stay away. The last time I saw her I drove 3 hours with her grandchild because her sister died. Everyone came to her house because she lived near the sister. She left when I was 14 and she introduced me to strangers as her daughter that made her leave when I was 16. She had nothing nice to say about me.
