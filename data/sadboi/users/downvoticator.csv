1200isfineIGUESSugh,f7gz2zw,t1_f7fhboh,1573725348.0,"Hey  OP! I'm also an emotional eater. Here's what my therapist told me: 

When you feel like binging on food, take a moment to write what you're feeling. Happy? Guilty? Sad? Angry? 

You can then proceed the binge. Then write down what you feel afterward. Ashamed? Satisified? Etc. 

For people like us, it can be so important to identify WHY we have an unhealthy relationship with food.

\> It's my fault entirely, I know. 

Be kinder to yourself! This is not your ""fault"". You exist in a body that WANTS unhealthy fatty food, because it's evolutionarily programmed to think that that's what it needs. You exist at a time where cheap fatty food is common. You exist in a space where you're surrounded by unsupportive family/friends. This is hard! This is so hard! You can allow yourself to admit that this is hard for you even if it seems easy/natural to others! 

Here are my other tips: 

1. If you're a volume eater, try binging on healthy things instead. Lettuce, cauliflower, etc, just to go through the motions.
2. Keep your mouth busy (lol) - the physical sensation of something in your mouth is helpful. Drink water, chew gum, lollipops, etc.
3. Self-control is a muscle that needs to be trained. Self-control is a finite resource. Are you practicing self-control at work? At school? In going to the gym, or brushing your teeth, or cleaning the toilet, or quitting smoking, or making yourself wake up early? these things all take self-control. 
4. Give a homeless person the food you bring with you from home. It makes you feel better, it makes them feel better, and now you're not bringing it with you in a space that you might eat an unhealthy amount of it. 
5. There's no such thing as inherently unhealthy food or ""bad food"". Depending on the composition of the rest of your diet, for example, a pizza or burger might be exactly what you need and workable in your calorie budget. Remove morality from food. Remove guilt, as much as possible, from your diet. Your main problem, from the sound of it, is portion control in general. 
6. Calorie counting will help you even on days you go above your maintenance because it will help you understand why things are happening to your body.
7. You can't outrun a bad diet, blah blah blah, but if you're inactive try walking more - just once a day - and your body will be able to put some of that energy/food to better use. I stopped using Uber/taxis when I moved to a new place, went from walking 2000-3000 steps a day to 10,000 and it's been so good for my body. I highly recommend it. 
8. It's not impolite to just not visit your paternal side of the family during mealtimes or to bring your own food. There are a lot of cultural/social expectations around food. Fuck 'em.

&#x200B;

Sorry this turned out to be so long! 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Be kind and compassionate to yourself/your body when you are on a mission to improve yourself/your body."

Tbh I know that I have no choice but to either 1. Do all these things I hate and get healthier or 2. Enjoy myself with food and get less healthy.

I think everyone who‚Äôs on this sub is getting on with it. I do think your reply is harsh but not unwarrantedly so.

> Healthy options are not more expensive 

I wish that were true for me in my area! It could be because I‚Äôm a student in uni, but unhealthy food is free/super cheap. There‚Äôs always free donuts and cookies in the common rooms and libraries, free sandwiches, free pizza dinners, 50% off coupons fast food chains, etc. buying & cooking my own meals has been more expensive and time consuming than eating cheap garbage but it‚Äôs worth it.

Kind of like this recipe, which was the inspiration:  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken\_in\_a\_creamy\_84614](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken_in_a_creamy_84614) 

I didn't include as much chicken stock, but I did add carrots and more mushrooms. It was super filling and ended up at under 400 cals, which is good because I'm generally aiming for 300-500 calories a meal without snacks."

1200isfineIGUESSugh,f5rihgi,t1_f5pmu0w,1572395145.0,"That's really good to remember. Sometimes it's frustrating because the process feels like it's going so slowly, but even no progress is still progress as long as I'm still tracking/at maintenance as opposed to unhealthy restrict/binge cycles. I'm really excited for walking to get easier.  I have a lot of friends who run track and walk fast and I recently noticed that I'm able to keep up with them without as much effort. 

Thank you for your comment!"
