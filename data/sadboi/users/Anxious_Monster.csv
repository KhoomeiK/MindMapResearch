SuicideWatch,fbg9gmf,t3_ed6ika,1576841180.0,"I think you are correct to dislike generic platitudes about life. Your instinct as to why you’ve heard these empty phrases, I feel, is also true. A person who has not experienced depression, is untrained as a mental health professional  (and sometimes those who are,) or without a great deal of empathy typically won’t know how to respond.  

I’d like to thank you for reaching out to the people of this subreddit. I recognize the catharsis felt from expressing your thoughts to another person and the anxiety that prevents one from sharing. I see you and your feelings are valid."
SuicideWatch,fbenbfk,t1_fbdrkkd,1576789520.0,"I don’t think you’re wasting anyone’s time. I don’t believe there is a wrong way to live.  Accomplishing arbitrary goals you feel you should have at X years old to make others happy or proud likely wouldn’t improve your self-worth.  If you hate yourself, nothing you do feels like it has value. I would avoid comparing your life to what you think others have. What would give your life value and purpose is self-defined.  If you have the means, therapy could help give perspective to your emotional and mental health. 

Regarding your original question, I’m a life long depressive and I feel suicide is the most likely way I’m going to die. I currently have an obligation I’m compelled to complete before I can allow myself to make that decision.  I don’t think it’s cowardly or less valid than any other choice a person may make for themself."
