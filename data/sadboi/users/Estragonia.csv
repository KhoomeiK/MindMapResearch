rupaulsdragrace,fqaoyn9,t1_fq9uzwx,1589222776.0,I might get downvoted for this but I believe the combination of having Silky and Vanjie in the cast just led to it being a loud chaos. At least that‘s how I remember it. It was mostly Silky who did ruin it for me. She might be a wonderful person but in opinion she did try to hard to be in the spotlight which made some episodes very cringy and unwatchable.

I can totally see why people would argue that it‘s intended to be a place that people integrate into their life in order to have some sort of subconscious awareness of the events that took place that led to the existence of this memorial and at first I did agree with that view.

At the end of the day I decided that it’s not a memorial for me but for the Jewish people so they should decide how we should interact with it. Tbf I‘ve only seen Shahak Shapira‘s (the #yolocaust guy) campaign and I don’t know how other Jewish people feel about it. There’s probably differing opinions there as well. So I personally try to be respectful in order not to hurt any feelings."

Apart from that Berlin is a very hip, fun-loving city so there is always something going on. And the historic sites are numerous, I doubt I ever get to see them all. And yes, especially Mustafa‘s Gemüse Kebab is always worth a visit. :)

I agree with you about the Holocaust memorial, the feeling it gives you while walking through is mesmerizing. Can‘t really describe it. However, I personally find it in bad taste how many people use ist as a cool photo location for their instagram and their selfies. A jewish guy from Germany shamed those people under the hashtag #yolocaust but many are still doing it or are just not aware. I never know how to react to these people."

The two pictures were taken about three years apart.

Anxiety,es1i4w9,t1_es141d1,1561497348.0,"You really hit the nail on the head! It‘s exactly these cringe worthy situations, the deafening silence that I cannot stand. I am usually a very well liked person and get along with everyone, partly because I will do everything to try and avoid tension with other people. Makes me kind of a push over sometimes.

I agree I should have equal use of bathroom and kitchen. And it makes me angry that I don’t do it just because I avoid, avoid, avoid. But that’s what anxiety is, I guess. And I don’t know how to overcome it. If I really have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the day, knowing I‘ll meet someone in the kitchen I often have to hype myself up and calm myself down at the same time to find the courage to leave my room. I‘m talking full on breathing exercises and talking to myself for half an hour before I dare to do it. And it’s exhausting. Just staying in and avoiding everything is just sooo much easier.

I appreciate the advice about the microwave or mini fridge. I‘m actually considering something like this, it would make a huge impact. On the other hand I‘d feel like a failure because this would feel like I‘ve surrendered. I guess I don‘t like making it easier for myself, huh? :D

I will think about it though, it would probably really help me a lot."
Anxiety,es1h6w1,t1_es1brmd,1561496725.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words. It makes it easier, hearing that I‘m not the only one who experiences this.

I‘ve been on a good path in the last couple of years regarding my depression. The only factor that I truly felt made me worse in the past was having roommates. When I lived in a different city two years ago on my own, I had no issues with social anxiety at all (maybe small issues but nothing that would affect me badly). My mood was at an all time high and I felt I had my life on track. So it‘s hard to not blame it all on my living situation. 

I know I should probably look at what causes my anxiety and get counseling. But in all honesty, it sounds so exhausting. I‘m so tired of therapy. I just hope I‘ll stay with my boyfriend forever and avoids these types of situations altogether. 
I know it‘s not the right way. But right now I don’t feel like I have it in me to really work on this issue. I need to be in a better place mentally before I‘ll face this. But I hope I will eventually. Congratulations to you for making an appointment though! You‘re stronger than I am at the moment and I really admire that. Hope it all goes well for you. <3

And thanks for the advice regarding forgiveness. You kind of got me there. I am a person who bottles up a lot of anger inside. I‘m constantly pissed. I don’t ever show it but deep inside I get angry and annoyed very, very quickly. I‘ve been reading about meditation and mindfulness a lot recently and it inspired me to try to better myself and let go of all these feelings. And you just reminded me of this. At the end of the day anger will only poison my heart and mind, I know that. But it’s really tough for me to let go of it. I guess pride stands in the way. But I will constantly try to be a better person in my heart. Thank you for the reminder! <3"
