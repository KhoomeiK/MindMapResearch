You may never know why he had to go back, but soul groups stick together so you’ve been together before this life and will continue to be once he comes back, and in your next life. 

Somewhat of a tangent, but I didn’t get my kids vaccinated until after their first birthdays, and even then only one at a time, because I was *terrified* and convinced vaccines contribute to sids cases. A lot of cases coincidentally are at 2,4, and 6 months, right when babies are getting loaded up with shots. Whenever I hear of sids it’s always the first thing that comes to my mind.

Echoing what others have said, I’ve read about children remembering past lives and saying things like, “remember when I was in ur tummy but I had to leave?” to a mother that’s had a miscarriage. It’s beautiful, honestly a miracle."

Wash down there with just water. Open yourself up and wash thoroughly with water..Don’t ever put soap inside ur lips or inside yourself. Douching is antiquated and unnecessary.

The bumps on nipples are glands to excrete oil, to moisturize ur nipples when ur breastfeeding a baby cuz they will get *chapped*.

Let’s see....hormones are no joke and supplements can definitely help you with pms. Do your research on evening primrose oil, CBD, Dim, calcium/magnesium. 

I wish someone had told me that birth control is the devil 😅 and while some really rely on it, many women don’t make the connection between weight gain, mood swings, general misery, and the synthetic hormones they’re taking every day. 

Men do not deserve the pedestal they’re sometimes put on. They’re mostly just horny idiots. 

Hope this helped! P.s, ur dad is a jerk."

I’m happy....I’m engaged with two beautiful girls, we both have nice jobs, two cars in the garage. Yet even last night I was laying in bed with this nagging feeling in my heart. Like I’m constantly searching for something. 
When I finally lose those 20 lbs, when I have a new wardrobe or my hair/nails done will I feel complete? 
No I won’t. The only thing that fills that nagging is like....the peace of God honestly. Knowing that this world could all be a simulation, or earth is a school for our souls to learn and grow, or even that we chose to have this disorder in order to learn certain life lessons.
