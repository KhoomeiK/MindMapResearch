chicago,fqdjkbr,t1_fqc9xl1,1589291035.0,I worked on at least 2 or 3 student films that shot some scenes there. Everyone was always super friendly but it just felt sort of dirty in there.

TrueOffMyChest,fp415w1,t1_fp3brub,1588289656.0,"Hey, this comes off super insulting. A lot of OnlyFans people are professionals, students, etc. I’m not sure why you’re so angry about women because this comment comes off just really sexist to me. You don’t have to be okay with dating a sex worker but it’s really unfair to just across the board say they’re uneducated."
poledancing,fp40g5i,t1_fp3u9w5,1588289262.0,Thank you!! This is exactly what I was looking for.
poledancing,fp2sew3,t3_gazwun,1588267112.0,Alternatively- how often did you take pole classes to get to a spot where you could do lifts and tricks? (Without practice at home)

chicago,fmwfft6,t1_fmwdwe2,1586445619.0,I filed a while ago and then successfully certified one week ago. Got the confirmation of direct deposit being set up and that’s the last I heard.

chicago,fmwaq0b,t3_fvu5av,1586443042.0,Does anyone have any advice on how to get through to a help line for JobLink? I tried posting about it but mods deleted. I am so desperate. My JobLink username was disabled and I can't get into the site to upload a resume. Already certified a week ago and have no funds.
Anxiety,fmc2ms0,t3_ftvliz,1585937752.0,For me I like to be held extremely tight and just curl up and get small
Anxiety,fmc1kux,t3_ftyfe7,1585937184.0,YES. I feel this so hard. Until two days ago I was feeling somewhat stable and decent but now shit is hitting the fan and my depression is creeping back in too. Haven't found a really good coping strategy other than going for a jog or something but it's so shortlived. Definitely smoking too much weed in the evenings just to escape my anxious thoughts.
chicago,fmb50ly,t1_fmb4u13,1585918496.0,"I’ve been doing curbside pickup of smaller pieces off Facebook, getting some things delivered from online furniture stores too. Sucks because I really didn’t want to order from the big guys online, would rather shop local and all"

Seattle,fk7gu8k,t1_fk7d8o2,1583936167.0,Thanks. Just trying to get an idea of what it’s looking like on the ground there. I freelance so I can easily self quarantine thankfully
