I did get in appts w two docs before covid started: a rheumatologist, and an osteopath GP who really knows his stuff. 

Also, 
**TL;DR** because my comment to you is long and detailed...

**TLDR:** I’ll pm you some Qs to figure out clues about what’s going on if you’re okay w answering, but no pressure to answer. I answered the same Qs below. My stuff might be autoimmune disease or just phone overuse or some overdid-it injury. 

Okay **longer deets below**: 📜 

————————

The rheumy followed up with my bloodwork 🩸 over telehealth 🤳 👩🏻‍⚕️ and says she doesn’t know the exact cause but wants to give **steroid injections** for my hands... but only *after* covid ends🦠 aka when the clinic reopens, *nooooooo* 😭⏳

The osteopath 🧑‍⚕️said I have non-serological / serology-neg Rheumatoid Arthritis (I already have other autoimmune diseases so that sucks but is not surprising). But now his clinic closed like almost 2 months ago for Covid. 😫

They both say it’s **not carpal tunnel** from the in-person appts I had right before Covid on it. 

I have no idea if any of that is useful to you and I also don’t want to worry you that you might have one of my illnesses. I hope this covid things ends so you can get it fixed asap! 

———————————
**If you want more details on my stuff to see if there are mutual clues that could help, here they are below** 

Doot doot doo...just a warning —  **LONG SECTION BELOW**
 
**NO PRESSURE TO READ PLZ**
(Offering *only if possibly helpful for finding clues.* 🔎)

...

**WARNING AGAIN: THIS NEXT PART ABOUT SYMPTOMS, ETC IS LONG:**


—- **When**: For me, it started *late Jan* this year, almost 4 months ago.—

—**Preceding Relevant(?) Events**: 
I suspect a few things might have caused it, but I don’t know:—

**Event 1**- *Removing phone case?:* I removed a big plastic phone case from my iphone 8 plus so it would fit in my coat pocket better. This resulted in me having to actually *grip my phone much harder* and more arduously now that *the bigger weight-distributing case was gone* and also because the phone itself is a *very very very slippery glass* with *rounded slippery sides*. (As though intentionally designed so that it would fall and break. 🤔)

...But this is a head-scratcher bc lots of ppl use the iphone 8plus case-free and don’t develop hand pain. 🤷‍♂️

**Event 2-** I played *video games* one night in late jan for only about an hour and it made my hands very *sore*. (I was reeeeallly into it.) 🎮

**Event 3-** I started working out  🏋️‍♀️ in mid-jan and it included *push-ups.* But for the first time ever, I used *wrist guards*  when my whole life I never did, and I suspect I did something wrong because it maybe worked opposite of how it’s supposed to? 

**Event 4-** General *phone overuse* I’m guessing? 😭🤳


—**Pain Area/activities**: —

It hurts at the *knuckles and joints* 👊of my fingers when I *bend or straighten* 🤚them or try to pick something up. 

It hurts my *metacarpals* (upper palm) when I hold something. 🦥 

It hurts in a long line from the middle of my *wrist down my inner forearm* 🤽almost up to my inner side of elbow when I apply pressure, like if I *click* a mouse/trackpad 🖱or try to open or close a ziplock bag🤏🤕. 

It hurts really badly if I try to take a screenshot or adjust phone volume because of the *pressure* needed on those phone buttons.  📲😵 

Texting hurts, *typing hurts less* 💻, but still hurts. 

And something that makes everything hurt incredibly badly is HANDWRITING ✍️👿🥺🤬😭. It’s the holding, gripping, pressing down to paper, all of it hurts terribly. 
Touching or holding anything hard like a utensil. 🍴😖 (And forget about cutting or chopping🙁. ) 
Brushing my teeth hurts😶. 
And the skin of my palm-side of fingers is really sensitive to the touch. 🤚🥺


—**Pain Triggers**:—
Otherwise, *Mornings* 🌅are BAD, *pre-rain* 🌁is bad, *cold* 🌬❄️ seems to make it worse, and as mentioned, anything heavy/thin/dense/requiring a *grip* or *pinch* or *pressure* 🦥🤏🤽huuurts. 


—**Other relevant details**:—

I have Lupus SLE, Sjogren’s, “other unspecified mixed connective tissue disease,” ulcerative colitis, and my most recent bloodwork indicated something unusual from all my bloodwork before: something called “rolleaux formation” blood cells 🔬🩸which is when they clump/clot up together. 🧫 No clue of it’s relevant in any way. 

—**Life impact**:—

I have to cancel anything in the morning. 🌅🛑 With covid that’s easier to get away with. 
Have to ask my fiance for help w *everything* (who as a silver lining to covid, is now always around). 🤗

I can’t text my friends back easily 🙁📲and although they are understanding, it’s been going on for months and I am so so behind. I am also so behind on class obligations.📉

I was learning how to drive before this happened and now I can’t hold the steering wheel. 🚘 That’s okay I suppose, bc social distancing makes it so fiance has enough to do already and is the only person who can teach me (and not like we have anywhere to go now besides the store). I’ve become pretty useless. Luckily, again, covid makes everyone overall way more understanding of my delays from my hand pain than they were before covid. BUT it’s getting better. 


- **Helpful**: 
Someone told me that their friend w the same problem uses *Arnicare* Gel 🧴so I tried some and it does help take some of the edge off the pain in the morning. 

- **Heat**: 🔥🏖 Hot showers 🚿, 🛁, washing my hands in hot water🚰🧼 (good for covid haha), and wrapping my hands in my heating pad all help. 

- **Putting phone down**: 🛑📱📥 Honestly, **staying off my phone** helps. It’s so hard not to give into temptation to check👀 ...or type a long Reddit comment. 😂

- **Hand immobilizers**  and wrist brace and even wearing gloves!! 🧤helps prevent me from accidentally doing the actions that hurt the most, and / or provides padding when I do. Helps me stay off my phone, too. 📴 It’s extra hard when everyone is reaching out right now. 

- **Comp/Keyboard for texting:** There is a learning curve, but trying to text more *via typing* on text apps on my computer 💻 or bluetooth keyboard ⌨️ *instead* of on the phone helps. Still hurts but not as much. 

- Using a **phone holder, tripod,** etc is good too... 🤳 but it is still so tempting to slip and just quickly pick it up and text someone back. Ooouch.

- But, I *suspect* in my case it’s just a repetitive strain injury thing from
too much texting. (But maybe also I shouldn’t downplay the role of arthritis-causing autoimmune diseases like my docs say).;)  🩺 

- Luckily, there are good days now and it goes up and down. ⬆️⬇️⤴️↔️ Weirdly, seems like ☀️sunnier days = healthier hands and ☁️pre-rain = pain. 🌚Evenings are better and mornings🌅😟 are bad.  (Oh and I tried diff sleep positions and pillows — no dice!) 🛏 

- Unfortunately, I don’t find that any otc pain relief helps. not tylenol or aleve or advil or asprin or even super good cbd. :( 💊🙁⏰ 

Even though covid has some silver lining with coping abilities, I can’t wait for this to end so I can go get my injections. 🕰 

I’m also going to go ahead and use this as a day to put my phone down now. 📴🥳

:)

optimisemylife,fpnvqon,t3_gec78j,1588773567.0,"EDIT: I just realized you might be a guy based on your username so I’m deleting the mani/gel manicure/fake nails tips, though I’m totally going on assumptions and stereotypes here. 

Things that have helped me, albeit temporarily: 
-Gloves, 
-Bandaids around each fingertip, 
-Having a nailcutter or file with you all the time so when you spot a snag that tempts you to bite, you can fix it without biting

[the reason I suggest having a nail file or cutter with you always is that for me, sometimes I just can’t help but bite if I spot, like, a little bump or ridge out of place on a fingernail tip— i just can’t help it. I feel like it *needs* to go. It’s a perfectionism thing, I think. So if I have an easy way to deal w the physical imperfection/thing where I can immediately take care of it *without* biting, it helps.] 

Also, biotin supplements can make some people’s nails so hard that they become too difficult to bite. Maybe? 

Something I’ve noticed was that for me, I’ve tended *not* to bite my nails during times of lower stress. 

You mentioned that you bite more when stressed/bored. Maybe for the next few times you you catch yourself biting (it’s so hard to catch yourself biting, but for those times you do) perhaps try to make note in a journal or something what is the feeling you’re having, or what is the stressor you are thinking about right now? Maybe there is a pattern to that (like I dunno, for example: deadlines, a conflict with someone, something you have to do but dread) and there you might see the patterns and look to some way to proactively deal with or reduce these stressors (and subsequent nail-biting). 

Also if you live with someone, can you ask them to gently point it out if they see you biting — not to get you to stop right now— but just so that you can pause and notice the possible stress trigger? 

Most people who bite do so while on auto-pilot so they often don’t always notice unless reeeeallly closely intentionally monitoring. It can help if it’s pointed out to you, for info purposes, and *not* for scolding or a no-bite reminder. 

[I know — now we’re doing life overhaul of stressors/anxieties just for nails, but I think it may be worth looking into. 
Perhaps the biting continues, but your quality of life goes up, anyway. ❤️ ]

[[BUT ... if you do just need accountability, you could set something up where you have to pay someone you live with everytime they notice you biting your nails. ;) ]] (though to protect your finances, I’d try reducing the cues to bite first...;) )"

BrainFog,fgpmg1b,t1_fgocavk,1581007751.0,"In college, i went to see a counselor for anxiety and after several sessions of talk therapy, she actually made the connection. She said that my habits and the way i process information *really* resemble the symptoms of adhd to her so she referred me to a school psychiatrist for testing. I took a reeeeeeeally long test and the psychiatrist affirmed repeatedly that I definitely have adhd and we tried a few different meds. I didnt like any of them and then I graduated so I didnt treat it for another 8ish years. 

Then, unfortunately I got lupus and extreme fatigue that goes with it. So then I was prescribed adderall by a new-psychiatrist w consultation from my GP and rheumy for off-label treatment of fatigue. It was a higher dose than for adhd. It gave me my life back...temporarily. Like 2-3 years. But I developed a tolerance and kept having to increase the dose until it was no longer safe to take and until i also hit the legal limit. Keep in mind I’m 84 pounds and 5’1. 

So now I’ve just been taking the most dangerously high amount legally possible for even like 275-pound athletes and it doesn’t help me anymore. At this point, I only take it to avoid withdrawal symptoms (whoch include fatigue and lethargy! Ahhhh)  but it’s no longer therapeutic for me. I just can’t handle the withdrawal and when I taper oooh I still withdraw bad. Kinda stuck right now. Like i already am sick, so adding insult to injury has been too tough for me. Every once in a while, I’m able to skip a day in the process of trying to quit and the headaches and lethargy are torture.

EDIT: however, not to just be a downer, I’ve heard vyvanse, ritalin, concerta, are stimulants that can work out better for adhd for some folks. There’s also strattera, which is not a stimulant but is supposed to help with both focus and anxiety and from what I’ve been told it’s one of the least addictive ones. Problem is my health insura nce ONLY covers adderall which I’ve heard is the most addictive."

I still benefit from the motivation wellbutrin brings though. Also, it seems to activate a part of my brain that makes me extra-into sex, and that’s fun lol. But i do skip wellbutrin when I care about making “smart” decisions or sounding not-dumb.

AskReddit,fg41f1y,t3_enobb3,1580494139.0,"It’s not perfectly photographic, but I seem to have it with sound. It makes me amazing at choosing gifts for people because I remember everything they’ve told me and can synthesize that into something they are seeking : need / want / would enjoy. Everyone feels special and thinks I’m sooooo thoughtful but it’s just I’m a little thoughtful and love them, sure, but my memory is why I did a good job. 

Sometimes it’s useful and sometimes just shitty to know when people are lying / inconsistent. I was interviewed for a job I really wanted and they told me some insider info in interview 1. When I brought it up in interview round 5 as a way to compliment them / express they made the best move there, it freaked them out and they pretended that’s not correct. The lie led me to later learn that I wasn’t chosen for the role because of a disability I have that they became aware of and didn’t feel they could accommodate. :(  And that’s just really discouraging and demoralizing to know during a job hunt. Employers don’t want me. Things where it would have been better if I didn’t know. Stuff like that. 

And like others have said, it’s awkward to remember someone or a moment more than another person. They feel creeped out when you remember them and the minuscule details of everything they said that one time you met 9 and a half years ago. I also end up liking people more than they like me for that reason, and it hurts when you fade from the memory of people you remember clearly and admire while you remember your good times like...well, even more recent than yesterday. 

Also, it can create other faux pas too! I first realized what was up when I was 7 years old. I was becoming friends with a classmate who wanted to talk on the phone later! Yay! I told her my hone phone number and she wrote it down, which I was surprised by, but thought was a nice touch. Something grown ups do, so cool! When she told me her number, she looked at me like she was seeing something strange. Then she asked, “uh.....aren’t you going to write it down??” I realized in that moment what was happening and jumped to hurry up and fake needing to write it down. I still know her phone number...and every long-gone person’s birthday....and all the super boring conversations I’ve either been in or overheard.... etc etc. It’s like a mostly-useless audio recording with some useful perks.

EDIT: also perhaps interesting to note is that I am 100% deaf in my left ear. Sometimes I joke that I have some weird gene that turns my left ear from a hearing device into a tape recorder. (Not the same thing as the disability I mentioned btw.)"

Attempting the FODMAP diet helped a smidge in that i learned garlic&onions are two of my trigger foods. But there are too many others to keep track and know. And trigger foods that also aren’t FODMAPS.

sleep,ffgvq0l,t1_ffgafaw,1579916273.0,"Curious— is the longer-than-average sleep causing the stroke risk? I was thinking there’s no cause. 

Like one’s propensity for stroke risk could cause/create the increase of the hours spent in sleep. 

Or there could also be some outside factor that increases stroke risk (like some particular illnesses), and the outside factor happens to also increase the need or duration of sleep. (For example, take disturbed/interrupted  sleep, like in undiagnosed sleep apnea, that is mistaken in the studies for long sleep. Those folks would need to sleep for longer to get closer to “enough.” And let’s say sleep prevents strokes, then in that case, the crappier (but “longer”) sleep that those undiagnosed folks get, the more likely they are to get strokes. So then the findings are mistaken for blaming the long sleep for ppl getting strokes.)

We talked about and watched tapes of Malcolm X and pics times that MLK visited this same church when they were there as kids. They talked about the importance of social justice. 

there was only about a minute spent on a referenced bible quote about why it is necessary to disturb the peace and break unjust laws and social mores of politeness for the sake of justice. 

Holy fuck. 

They also don’t believe in the idea that anyone is going to hell for their beliefs : their translation of “I am the way, the truth, and the light” is that it’s supposed to say, “I am *a* way to the truth and the light” and not that other ways are wrong. And “follow me and you will be saved,” to them means “my guidance will help you feel more connected, loving, and happy, and I can help you do the right thing.” but not jesus-is-the-only-one-who-knows-what’s-right. 

They also believe that the anti-lgbt-sounding stuff was all wrong, that it was more metaphorical : seek relationships with your opposites. Ying&yang personality type idea. Masculine/feminine. 

They’re very much : the bible was mistranslated over so many years by humans that you have to have some help from both your heart and a scholar to figure it out. And it’s certainly not God’s only word. You can use other religions’ texts to help decipher how they interpreted it when they received divine guidance in other times and cultures/contexts. The chuch’s main focus right now is helping asylum seekers and refugees. 

And the question of the night was: how can you do better as an activist? 

This is exactly my kind of shit. I’m not about to go convert or anything, but now I want to keep going back every week lol. 

I see why she recommended it to me. 

Lol should I delete my post?"

raisedbynarcissists,f88w7i3,t1_f865odv,1574362492.0,"Thank you! I totally understand. 

The thing is, with me... I’m learning it’s important for me to learn to say “no” in baby steps. 

First, I have to learn to say “no” to small things in low-risk situations, where I might ordinarily say yes by default/obligation, but where the anxiety of “no” is tolerable. At first. 

Then, I see that I survived it, and practice more and more “no”s on slightly bigger things. 

What I do is: I look at my to-do list and see what of that is out of obligation. Then, I pick what to remove/say no to. 

So one small “no” for me recently was deciding not to attend a family wedding this past year (which led to skipping 3!), because I didn’t have the resources to go without really making things bad for myself. I felt so very justified, and so I finally skipped one.  Phew! Then a second. Then a third! 

This time, Religion is a sticky point for me because people get so heated, and it feels scary, and I really admire this woman who is so so super cool and also a really big deal. 

I was introduced to her by a former boss  (now retired) who I greatly admire. He introduced me because she had/has a similar winding life path like mine and nontraditional career. They are very close. And my former boss still writes my reference letters for jobs to this day (just in case I can go traditional for a sec to pay bills!), so...I’m not ready to tell her this makes me uncomfortable and anxious about potentially being proselytized to, and I know for sure that any organized religion is probably just not for me. 

But I totally see what you’re saying, though! Like yeah, I anticipate this being stressful and/or hard-to-follow/understand all this old english, that leaves me feeling stupid and like a phony and on the defensive for proselytization and maybe getting roped into committing to more things. 

But I will at least say I’m studying a different religion from mine, when I go."

internetparents,f2w784b,t3_dea7v0,1570462204.0,"I think I have a slightly unpopular opinion. 

I agree absolutely It WAS a good idea to tell your therapist. If you’re worried about confidentiality, everyone above already said it. 

But I’m a little worried about how comfortable/free you’ll feel in therapy to talk about stuff. I noticed that she assumed heterosexuality from the get-go when talking to you about romance, and also worded the question as though hetero is the default. How do you feel about that? The way I’m reading it, I’m feeling uncomfortable with those assumptions, but tone&context are everything, so I would just consider if that made you feel comfortable/fine/bad etc. 

Now, I’m also not sure if “well that’s your private business and whatever you do in your private life is on you” is her way of shutting the door on you getting to talk to her about being gay, about dating and love, etc etc. —essentially dismissing it. Did it sound like she was uncomfortable hearing this detail about your sexuality? 
Or, did the way she said it feel more empowering, like to know it’s your personal business (did it sound more like she was saying it’s 100% okay to decide every bit whether and if/when/how to tell or not tell others, and stepping back, is she someone you’d like her help with figuring out your answers to these Qs)?  

Even if she will keep everything confidential, if you don’t feel free and comfortable and accepted enough by her to fully express yourself to her, I’d recommend switching therapists. 

I know for me it took me a few tries to find a great fit."

I just learned from NYU Langone Lupus Center research from Feb 19 of this year that lupus patients have 5x the amount of ruminococcus gnavus than they should.  

Also, r. gnavus leakages may trigger “continuous and unrelenting” antibodies.

Bacteroides uniformis can help combat r. gnavus, but in Lupus patients, b. uniformis is 4x LESS than what it should be. 

I have no idea if that’s useful. Just sharing."
