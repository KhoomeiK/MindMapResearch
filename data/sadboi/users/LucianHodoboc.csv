Those are all lies. He did not create humans to be horny from early teens. He created humans to be perfect, but satan corrupted creation by making them believe lies. Once you develop a close relationship with God through prayer and obedience to Him, your sexual desire (and everything else that satan corrupted) readjusts to the standards of God. Instead of seeing women as potential sex partners, you see them as sisters in Christ; what we call ""sexual tension"" between guys and girls literally vanishes.

The thing is that satan and his followers have run society in such a way that people are shown the twisted view of God's original design everywhere. Entertainment, social media and many other things portray humans as primarily sexual creatures, so, if you're taught from an early age that that is the normality, it's difficult to seek God's truth during the teenage years, when the body starts to develop. But, seeing how there are plenty of Christian teenagers who live chaste lives with God's help, we have clear proof that it's possible. Nevertheless, the apostle Paul does say, in his first letter to the Corinthians, that not all people have the same gifts of the Spirit. Some don't have the gift of chastity and are recommended to get married at the age that God has approved through social laws.

I don't know of any way of describing how  the mind and desires completely change; unless you've experienced it yourself, you will probably not understand it. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis: it's like wanting to play in the mud puddle from the middle of the street because you don't know that you could just ask your dad to take you to the amusement park (and He'd gladly do it)."

helpme,fnkfvj2,t3_g1zm1y,1587025495.0,"Don't kill yourself. You will rob yourself of an awesome future. You don't want to die. You just want to be treated right by your family, and you're perfectly entitled to want that. Don't let others influence you into giving up on your ambitions and goals. Chances are that  you will launch a pretty popular lawn care company and you will make enough money to make a decent living. If you can't have access to a psychotherapist or psychiatrist, just ask your school  counselor for guidance. Talk to someone who can help you, whether a teacher or a priest at your local church or the parents of your closest friend. You sound like an awesome person who had the misfortune to have a dysfunctional family (I had a dysfunctional family too, so I can relate to your troubles, but believe me, it gets better, you just have to push through and fix your eyes on your goals, have a clear vision for your life and ask for help because there are people out there who are willing to help you). Stay strong. You can overcome these troubles, and someday you will look back and thank yourself for not giving into the suicidal thoughts. Take it one day at a time. God bless you!"
mentalhealth,fni5ny6,t3_g1q7tk,1586974402.0,"> I strongly believe that I **am** worthless. It's the objective truth, and I think I'm correct and reasonable in thinking that way. 

Work on exploring why you think that is truth. Write down all the arguments you have to support said belief and ask you therapists to help you explore your past and find counterarguments for each of those arguments.

Since you mentioned atheism and Christianity, may I ask whether you're a believer or an atheist (or something else)? If you're willing to share, of course. Regardless of whether you're a believer or not, I would like you to watch a certain video from YouTube. It might help you."
Scrupulosity,fnhc5pm,t3_g1r2hl,1586959558.0,"I relate to most of what you said. Through prayer and guidance from a few other Christians, I've found out that these opinions are a matter of demonic influence. I've had my perspective shifted almost 180 degrees for a short period of time after deciding to obey His rules and pray a lot for a few days. I actually had a bit of a shock because I had no idea what had happened. Like I said, I've been struggling with scrupulosity and control issues for years (due to being disabled and having been raised in a dysfunctional family), and then I found on social media some Christians who sought God and had supernatural experiences. I decided to pray every day and be honest to God in prayer about the fact that I feel against Him, angry with Him and so on. I asked Him to change me, to make me see things the way He does. I did this for weeks or months. I can't remember. My feelings began to gradually change and then, one day, during prayer, I felt an overwhelming desire to do only what He wants. It felt as if doing things my way seemed completely illogical and there was a sense of peace and assurance that I was saved. It lasted for less than a day, but while it lasted I just sat there on the couch thinking that this might be it, that I might be about to die and be taken to Paradise or something. The overwhelming sensation that I was nothing without God ended the next day, when satan tempted me to sin and I gave in due to being confused about what was happening. No matter how much I tried and pleaded for the mindset change to return, it has yet to happen, and I've been left with the feelings you describe in your post, plus a lot of confusion about what in the world happened. Did God give up on me? I have no idea what kind of games He's playing.

Sadly, I have no advice to offer, as I'm still in the process of understanding how and why He works the way He does. However, I do recommend you watch Bob Hemp's videos on Freedom on YouTube. He mentions something that has helped me to some degree: before sinning, Adam and Eve were plugged into the divine energy of God. God's way of doing things powered them. They didn't have to take decisions and assess whether the things they did were wrong or right, which meant that they enjoyed every moment of their existence. When they sinned against God, they disconnected themselves from the source that was powering them and connected themselves to another source: that of knowledge - of good and of evil. They began to be overwhelmed by the fact that evil had unpleasant consequences in their lives, so they had to constantly assess every thing, every action, in order to know if it is good. This constant struggle made them and the rest of humanity (through genetic inheritance) unable to feel complete satisfaction. Even when people choose good, it is still a fact that they have to waste the time of assessment-making before choosing good that leaves them less time to be satisfied than they would have if they were simply plugged into the source of divine energy that is God. That is what Jesus came to fix. Through the Holy Spirit, we are supposed to somehow be re-connected to God, so that doing God becomes instinctual for us again, like we were originally designed. Somehow (I don't know how, I have not figured it out, so don't ask me) believing in Christ's sacrifice for our sins changes our perspective. It's a gradual thing, I think. Like, knowing that God (or part of God) came down and suffered to fix His creations increases our trust in Him. If He is willing to do that, then He probably has our best interest in mind. Once that idea sinks in, you go from there and meditate on it, and pray some more and so on...
