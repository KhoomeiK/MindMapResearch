Peripheryband,fetd1fc,t3_eqh87n,1579374060.0,Ji’s my favorite track off the record.  I think it’s melodic victory.  To each is their own.  I hope you enjoy it more someday!
Peripheryband,fdnvpm3,t1_fdnoo9h,1578593805.0,Have you a moment to talk about the red?
Peripheryband,fdnveuy,t3_ellbou,1578593632.0,Since this is a shitpost I’m assuming the more it’s hated the stronger it becomes?
Peripheryband,fdnvch0,t1_fdjyori,1578593593.0,Dude is that H3H3?
Peripheryband,faqw5u3,t1_faoby38,1576309027.0,Honestly I thought Ji was one of the highlights of the record.  It doesn’t really click with a lot of fans for some reason.
Peripheryband,fafh3oc,t1_faaeu50,1576022587.0,Nice
Metalcore,faaryet,t3_e89eqx,1575912757.0,"Véronique by Kadinja.  I don’t know if it’s necessarily a breakdown but just a super dark, trippy part at 1:32."
Peripheryband,f5thgxt,t3_doui5t,1572458732.0,Never! What better way to promote a new album than by eliminating its competition!
Peripheryband,f05pdio,t1_f05bsj3,1568415863.0,Misha broke up with her for P4.  Said she couldn’t even sweep pick like the incel she was and he started dating a Lambo.
Peripheryband,eylvjlo,t3_cx1u08,1567193017.0,The big sex
Peripheryband,extktda,t3_cue96g,1566570513.0,That sounded great.  The chords were gorgeous too.  Nolly is such a clean player too.  Totally buying this.
Peripheryband,er72xr3,t3_c0rqa3,1560565273.0,"I was kinda on the same vibe with wanting to expand my playing.  You don’t have to go my route but I learned the entirety of Omega.  Talk about a song that goes through the motions.  The only technique that one lacks is tapping but big, colorful chords, alternate picking, interesting melodies, moderate speed sweeping, string skipping alternate picking, neat rhythmic playing and some feelsy lead work make up the aspects of how beneficial it is to learn a piece like that for increasing your technique.  All New Materials is another great song  to learn that I did a while back.  For increasing your tapping prowess and understanding a bit of melodic tapping I’d recommend the 2 minute mark of Letter Experiment.  Take it slow and build up accuracy playing at slower speeds for sure.  Best of luck my man, post some stuff sometime if you feel like sharing some playing!"
depression,epd208d,t3_bue9q3,1559161084.0,"Listen to It’s Only Smiles by Periphery.  The lyric that really helped me coping with a death is “She’d rather see a man up than me under” and that really speaks to me.  Try to seek out positive reinforcement and stay as happy and true to yourself as you can.  I’m so sorry for your loss, stay strong friend 💚"
