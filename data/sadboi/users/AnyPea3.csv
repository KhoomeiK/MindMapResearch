* Marriage is for the rest of your life. People don't really think about how long that is. 
* Marriage is about compromise. You can't do what you want but you need to get permission from someone else which can feel a bit limiting. 
* You will lose opportunities. Whether that is for sex, or relationships or jobs...you will lose something (you also gain something though). This can lead to resentment 
* You are married to someone who is getting older. They looked a certain way when you married them but as time goes on they are getting older and less attractive. 
* SEX! (this is a big one) couples tend to become less interested in sex with each other as they spend more time together. The novelty wears off. Sure you can still have good sex but the thrill of the first time with a young hottie, is replaced with routine and ""nice"" sex (far less often).
