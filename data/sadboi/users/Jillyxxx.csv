college,for2tur,t3_g8xg9s,1588005215.0,"As someone who came from Europe to study in the states, the material isn’t harder/easier but there are a lot more opportunities to get high grades. My friends in College in the Netherlands have 100% of their grades determined by exams, with one or two papers in the occasional class. However, in the US even just attending the class can add to your grade, homework counts towards your grade, labs count towards your grade etc. Additionally, raw grading in Europe of exams feels harsher from what I remember; miss two questions, you have a 7 (70%), which is way above average in NL yet considered bad in the US.

Lastly, it’s a different culture. In the Netherlands, it was actually frowned upon at my school to get really high grades. This is because it isn’t necessary to have good grades to get to college. You coasting by on 5.5’s (55%’s)? You can still go to a great college as long as it isn’t one of a select few super competitive programs in the country. And, because grades higher than a 7 will literally add nothing to your application even for selective programs, it is sometimes even considered arrogant to get high grades. In the US, grades matter way more! They determine your life permanently, there’s a huge different between just passing a class on a C and getting an A on your transcript."

Emotionally, however, my stepdad was there more for me than she ever was. So I don’t think it’s fair to assume that even if she was a stepmother the BF was entitled to her money.

They all assume that you enjoy the Yu-Gi-Oh cards more than she would, stating “you bought yourself a gift”. I sternly disagree. As a woman who plays MTG with her partner, I would be thrilled if he bought me $200+ worth of MtG cards, especially after agreeing no gifts. Like, that’s an amazing gift! She seems really entitled, pushing for this bag. Why doesn’t she just get it herself? What did she get for you? You are absolutely not the asshole and if the genders were reversed people would agree with me. Also, just her demanding a bag like that is so entitled.

cscareerquestions,f7emvdf,t3_dvtbmp,1573661272.0,"If you just graduated, I assume that you are on the relatively younger side. How long have you been with your partner?

Anyway, before this turns into a r/relationships post: I personally believe that when you're young + haven't been with an SO for a considerable amount of time, a huge jump in career like this takes precedent. Worst case, you guys are long distance for a few years while you build up your resume with the Bay Area company and then leverage that to get a better job in NYC. I think taking the offer in NYC  *only* for your SO will lead to resentment in the long term, so if that's the only thing keeping you from taking the Bay Area offer, I'd recommend taking the Bay Area one and going long distance instead."
