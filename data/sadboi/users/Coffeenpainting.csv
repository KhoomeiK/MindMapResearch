AsianBeauty,flf71pl,t3_fobvsi,1585099476.0,"Not Asian but same hair type, i still have this problem but it got a bit better when I blow dried my roots and brush my hair A LOT (we’re talking like 100 strokes a couple times a day), this evenly distributed the oils throughout the hair so it doesn’t look as greasy, but I have very long hair so idk if brushing will work for you. Anyway hope this helped,  but everyone’s different."

EatingDisorders,flc3dcp,t3_fnw6sr,1585018871.0,"Omg absolutely, the most common source of guilt I feel day to day is when I feel hungry, of course I know it’s a normal to feel hunger, in fact it’s important for survival, but I can’t help it :( definitely a characteristic of my ed, I’ve become an expert at trying to do something brain-power consuming so I forget about being hungry. I feel for you."

bulimia,fl8qcan,t3_fclq4t,1584929709.0,"Sorry about this being really late, but as someone who has struggled with this Ed, something I noticed when I was b/p less was that my family and friends were giving me a lot of positive reinforcement. It kind of counter acted the internal thoughts ravaging my mind. Saying kind things that are completely genuine (sounding fake could make it worse) really calmed the anxiety that goes along with it. For example my sister was telling me about her new friends (she’s in high school) were saying I looked so confident and beautiful, this was so touching and I didn’t even remember about purging that night. But words to heed, telling someone your proud of them for doing the act of eating can have a negative effect on someone with an Ed, I’ve known some people with anorexia who became bulimic after being to recover from anorexia because their family constantly “congratulated” them when they ate. Keep food out of conversations and make them feel loved, their is not much more you can do, it’s an internal mental battle that they must win for themself (but of course if it get extremely severe always consider talking to them about a recovery facility). I hoped this helped but as someone who has not fully recovered and whose family doesn’t even know I don’t have too much information."
