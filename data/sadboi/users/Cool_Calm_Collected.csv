I know that is going to be hard as fuck for you, because that is what you are concerned about, but it’s the truth. On a subconscious level the energy you are giving off is neediness and people can feel that and are pushed away from it. You need to get to a point where you are happy with yourself, and then people will almost magically be attracted to you. Simple? Yes. Easy? No at all. I’ve been on both sides and trust me man, when you in the place we’re you are happy and content with yourself, it’s truly almost magical how things work.

On the flip side we’ve been consolidating for ~2 years, and were consolidating for ~2 years last cycle before the initial move, so us not moving for another year doesn’t add up in that respect. Idk guys. I hope we get something soon since we’re back at 2500 sats, still in the .20 cent range, and people are getting frustrated. Basically, I’m not sure if we can expect a significant move soon.
