A dwarven [alliance] rogue is more likely a Dark Iron ""double agent"" than a Bronzebeard. Stormwind runs the SI:7 and therefore a dwarven rogue would most likely be an indipendent sellsword of sorts.

The story wrote itself with a Dark Iron dwarf breaking free from the enslavement of The Firelord and seeking revenge for the injustice  been done unto his lineage and clan.

Khrokavir is a member of a guild which plan to banish Ragnaros, <Ember>. Which means story and progression goes accordingly. The story came to fruition at the point of acceptance into the guild.

Now enter ""Khrokavir"".
Khrokavir is a Dark Iron refugee. He broke free from Ragnaros enslavement by pure force of will. Once free from Blackrock Mountain and The Firelords shackles, he fled to Dun Morogh for ""greener pastures"".

Khrokavir approached Ironforge and surrendered himself to the guards, at the gate. He asked for audience with the High King, Magni Bronzebeard to seek asylum. 

The High King demanded, in return of the favor granted, Khrokavir must venture back to Blackrock Mountain rescue his daughter and bring back her captor's head in a bag. 

The High King has pleaded Stormwind for help, but The Child King Wrynn and his council has failed to send aid.

Now Khrokavir mission is to become The High Kings personal assasin, to take revenge on the Thaurissian bloodline for all the ills it has inflicted upon dwarvenkind, bringing back Moira Bronzebeard if possible and banishing The Firelord from whence he came."
