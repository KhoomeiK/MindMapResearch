depression,epif5s0,t1_epi60pd,1559238338.0,"There are two type of people that say  ""cheer up"".  The ones that genuinely don't understand it and need to be educated on mental health. And then there's the ones that also feel depressed and can't process their emotions. Much like the rest of us can't.  They feel the need to happy. To put on that front, and when these people face someone strong enough to vulnerably reveal their depression, these people want to hide or just get them to be happy or pretend to be. It's the fear of what might happen if they try to take off that happy mask. Vulnerability is a scary thing for most people. It has been a scary thing for me for a long time. I hated being around people who were strong enough to admit that they aren't in a good space and possibly needed help. I was taught to be strong and not show any emotion except happy. No one in my real life knows what i go through. Because they think ""life is good"". I used to be that person too thinking the situation will get better an i should just be happy. If pretend to be happy,  I'll eventually be be happy."

And when I'm in bed, i can sleep because i feel like i need to be a profuctive human in society. When i try to do something, anything, the anxiety is overwhelming. The world constantly feels like its getting smaller and I'm falling into the abyss. The emotions don't beat me up, they follow me."
