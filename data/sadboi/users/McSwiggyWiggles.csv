Anxiety,fr2kpvm,t3_gm129l,1589838997.0,"Years ago I couldn’t even drive. It was horrible and I know exactly what that fear is like. If you haven’t already been in therapy or have any sort of therapist, reprocessing therapy has been a major game changer for me, and I would suggest mentioning it to them! You wouldn’t believe how many little negative memories of accidents or mishaps pile up in your memory over time, and they all resurface subconsciously the second you sit behind the wheel. After working on it REALLY hard, and also practicing and making sure all my coping methods were on hand, I took my parents extra car to Virginia a week or two ago and went totally alone. I have so much hope for myself now. Please just keep at it, I’m begging you, even if it’s always hard, it gets easier"

“The company said the mode is most effective at times when the game is GPU-bound, and frame rates are hovering between 60 fps and 100 fps. The mode should work in “all” GeForce GPUs in DirectX 9 and DirectX 11 games. The blog post said DirectX12 and Vulkan let the game decide when to queue frames for rendering, so the driver would have no control over lowering latency.”"
BattlefieldV,ew4esoi,t1_ew42hic,1565109089.0,"Are people seriously defending this shit? Are you people seriously going to shill this hard? It’s the year 2019. I paid for the DELUXE EDITION of your game. They either get their SHIT together or this game will be DEAD. This is reality. If the pacific DLC doesn’t save this game it’s done. Enough clowning around, you get PAID to do what you do.   

Edit: Downvote me all you want, you know it’s true. This is coming from someone who has played battlefield games for over a decade and cares just as much as anyone else."
