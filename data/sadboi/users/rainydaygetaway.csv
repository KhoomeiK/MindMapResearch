depression,ff4fi79,t3_enrs4c,1579562371.0,"I personally struggle with feeling like anything related to my mental health/illness is a lie. Like ***I*** know itâ€™s not a lie and in moments Iâ€™m feeling it super hard it feels like the entire world is crashing around me but when expressing it to someone else/ANYONE else it feels so phony and like Iâ€™m just making excuses or overreacting. I donâ€™t know why I feel this way but youâ€™re totally valid for feeling it because I do too and Iâ€™m sure lots of other people do as well. 

I recently started recording myself explaining things and then listening to them and itâ€™s helped a little bit with like putting things into words and taking a step back and listening to what I sound like/how I describe things but it also definitely makes me super insecure at the same time. 

I hope you find peace with this."
