If what you’re saying is true and the whole story, then this incident is a reflection on HIM, not on you. It may not feel like it, but you are better off now. Stay strong."
biglittlelies,esfsucs,t3_c7ixtg,1561934168.0,Yea it’s getting a little dumb

Anxiety,es5xbqs,t3_c5uovo,1561632954.0,"I relate to so much of this. Very relevant to my life, especially right now. Thank you. 

Keep us posted on the job! :) Hope you get it, but even if you don’t, you are clearly on the right track."
WhitePeopleTwitter,es5sjoq,t3_c5z95h,1561626128.0,Yea but what if that person sucks and you don’t like them. Then deflating their balloon is fun
biglittlelies,es5j60h,t1_es51vlh,1561613908.0,"Well that only ends up hurting her daughter. If she was calm, maybe her daughter wouldn’t have such high anxiety all the time"
thebachelor,es3h8hs,t1_es2ebe0,1561562493.0,"LOL at “F1” 😂 

yea Tyler is clearly a front runner. Does he really strike ppl as a smooth player? He just comes across as a clumsy bro to me. I like him though. I don’t trust guys who are that good looking tho. If he ends up being F1 (lol), I don’t it will last and then he will cruise into BIP. 

I’m starting to agree about Mike. He is a great catch and I like everything about him actually (I esp love that he calls out peoples’ BS). I just lost faith that this franchise would ever have a black bachelor because they just never seem to get around to it, but maybe this time will be a first!"
thebachelor,es29q03,t1_es28czu,1561517727.0,What tea?
thebachelor,es29pj9,t1_es26rht,1561517716.0,WHAAAAAAT ok then screw him

Advice,es21sv2,t1_es0ke8r,1561511631.0,That’s unnecessarily mean and spoils the fun of revenge

Advice,erzw1l1,t1_erzvovu,1561454713.0,"Thanks for responding! :)

I do avoid her, but sometimes we do end up interacting and she’s.... herself. She did it tonight.... brought something up w another roommate and me in an unnecessary way, and that’s what prompted me to post. 

The thing is, I would like to be able to “give as good as I get.” In general, being pushed around and walked on is a sensitive issue for me, and one I want to work on."
biglittlelies,ery24df,t1_erwcns2,1561398704.0,"Madeline would be PUT IN HER PLACE omg if that happened, Bonnie swooping in on 2 husbands in a row! Hahahaha"
biglittlelies,ery0zqx,t1_erwi52g,1561397987.0,I would be ok with him “getting even” in this way
biglittlelies,ery05is,t1_erwcwve,1561397455.0,Spot on
biglittlelies,ery01uh,t1_erxlgdq,1561397391.0,Agreed. Stop showing kids with unnaturally advanced music taste! Ruins the reality of the show.
biglittlelies,erxznwy,t1_erwfjfg,1561397144.0,Yea but that wouldn’t change the fact of her infidelity. Ed would be dumb to trust her just for sharing an unrelated secret.
biglittlelies,erxzk3r,t1_erwkofj,1561397079.0,"I actually hated Renata in this scene. So tacky and unhelpful and entitled. And the whole “what did you do?!” To the teacher who was only trying to help. She might be rich, but she’s got no class."
leaves,erjjxil,t1_erjj30u,1560933545.0,"Yea I was asking in general. I know a couple people who used to abuse alcohol and opiates, and keep quitting and relapsing, and they say it’s because of their disease. I feel that doesn’t apply to me, and I was taught that addiction is addiction, regardless of the substance, but these people have me questioning the whole thing because I am NOT like them and certainly want to hold myself accountable."
leaves,eriumr1,t1_eriiwlk,1560907692.0,"Well I’m a woman and would say the same thing about men lol. But breakups in general can be stressful, sure. I’ve been weed-free about 4 months and my life isn’t great but I’m in a better place to fix it now than before, so there’s that. Lots of hard work to be done. It’s just a question of how bad I want it."
leaves,eriij3b,t1_erhrml8,1560898517.0,"The breakup probably contributed too. The weed wasn’t the only problem. Certainly didn’t help and it’s a good thing it’s gone, but it’s not the only problem. It just takes a bad situation and makes it worse."

leaves,er4pquc,t3_c0csbd,1560503760.0,"Does it get easier the longer time goes by? I worry that it will always be a struggle and I’m prepared for that. 

I’m at 4 months now (and with a lot of support/help) and this isn’t my first attempt to quit either. I don’t know if I will ever NOT miss weed. I know I can’t go back, and don’t want to, but still. 

I just doubt the whole “it gets easier with time” thing. I think in the beginning, maybe, but after a while, it plateaus."
leaves,ep41git,t3_btruwc,1559032136.0,"Good on getting back on the wagon... however, I don’t minimize relapses and say something like “this is part of the process”... either you’re done or you’re not. And if you relapsed, you aren’t done. Simple, but not easy to swallow. 

If I relapse, I will admit to myself that I fucked up big time (bc that’s what it WILL mean) and take a good hard look at myself and why it happened, and then face the consequences. 

Nothing about it is ok."
funny,eolkrak,t3_bs9uce,1558672342.0,Good to show a high tolerance for stress.
