depression,f6nm6do,t3_drxcxa,1572994599.0,"Life is hard and we're just bombarded with so much stuff, psychologically as well. So much expectations to fulfill. A lot of what makes people depressed is this checklist mentality, a pre set life path everyone's supposed to have done. Tick those boxes and tick them at the right age. 

I have no more expectations for my life. Life isn't here to make us happy or please us. The subject of life is and always has been about survival and competition. My only task is to just take everything as it comes and try to make the best of it, all circumstances considered.

Thinking about my own mortality and meditating on it is strangely soothing as well and makes everything more bearable. Like a quote I came across ""Don't take life too seriously, no one gets out alive anyway."".
One day it will all be over and I won't have to be here anymore. I don't know when that day will come but I hope I won't have to wait much longer."
depression,f67n5ap,t3_dqmbwd,1572721074.0,"When I look back and analyze myself I can see that over the years I have become more reckless. Its not exactly that I go out and actively look for a way to die but its more like not being attached to my life, because my life has no value to me. Not being as cautious or healthy as I can be, losing my survival instinct. I think in the end its because of a deep rooted self hate and disdain for life."
depression,f33umhr,t3_dfen1r,1570645440.0,"Everyday life is a fight. The only thing I see is a life or death struggle to survive underneath a thin veneer of civilization. In the end this life or death struggle doesn't even matter and is meaningless. In 100 years time I'll be gone and no one will remember me or even know I existed, everything I was or did will be absolutely insignificant."
depression,f2fcnta,t3_dd88cb,1570215192.0,"I don't know what to do at social events. Nobody really wants to hang out with me. The rare moments I'm not alone I always feel like the third wheel. I don't want to look desperate and force myself on other people because they would just see me as a burden. But at the same time I don't want to be the guy that stands alone in some corner, standing alone makes me even more self-conscious. So most of the time I end up constantly walking around and looking busy by eating and drinking and taking plenty of toilet breaks. Socialising just always makes me feel worse about myself. If I have the option to stay away I always do, I only go if it is somewhat obligatory."
SuicideWatch,f1wfnwz,t3_daopv2,1569784186.0,"Yes, more and more it feels like that. Looking back my failed adolescence and early twenties set me up for an unfulfilled and empty life. I missed out on so much. Normally people think of that period as a time in their life of exploring the world, gathering experiences and having fun. For me it was a period of humiliation, isolation and deep depression becoming progressively worse and finally resulting in a total breakdown age 21. My life was going completely off the rails and I was very close to committing suicide.

I received help and therapy and took half a year or so to recover. The cost of my issues were that I became even more isolated and lost contact with even the few friends that I had. When I look back at that period in my life it is a gap. No meaningful experiences, no meaningful relationships. Im glad its over but at the same time look back with regret, I wish I was different back then. But I have accepted that I was who I was and it couldn't have been any other way. 

Mid 20s, I'm doing better now and am more stable, but at a cost. I have become more apathetic and numb. I still struggle to connect with others and my life is still isolated, empty and meaningless. ""Happiness"" just feels like a bad joke to me at this point. Life is struggle and suffering."
depression,f1v5sma,t3_darfyw,1569767293.0,"There is also a large gap between what popular culture tells us life is and what are lives should be and how life really is. Popular culture presents us with a romanticized and aestheticized view of what life is and how our lives should be, we are told that the supreme human goal is to experience happiness, fun, love, pleasure etcetera. We are made to feel defective, failures and alienated if our lives turn out to be different than that. But in reality life is hard, life is struggle, and inevitably most people will suffer."
depression,f1oxzpp,t3_dabyxj,1569666351.0,That feeling of alienation is so familiar. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a living ghost and already dead on the inside.
SuicideWatch,f195zld,t3_d8as22,1569268268.0,"I also have some doubts in the back of my mind. I think of death not as unlimited blackness or nothingness because there is no ''you'' so to speak to observe any of that when you are dead, but instead just as a night of sleep without dreaming and remembering anything in between falling asleep and waking up. I view that as probably most closely resembling death. But I do think we are just feeble creatures at the end of the day and we can never know anything for sure, although I think an afterlife is highly unlikely. My existence here is a mystery as well and is something that was brought about completely beyond my control. My biggest fear is existing as some sort of consciousness inside of an unlimited void. I once had a really bad nightmare as a kid that I just was some sort of floating observer and wanted to scream and move but could not I was completely trapped and frozen inside of an unlimited void."
depression,ezxknd0,t3_d2wy80,1568242818.0,"I watch with amazement at people with busy social lives, a large group of friends, girlfriends. I always ask myself how the hell do they do that!? Meanwhile I'm trying to keep myself from falling apart and my life from completely derailing, on my own, and it consumes all of my time and energy. To maintain such a busy social life seems impossible for me. I feel like an outlier and alienated."
depression,ezxht6o,t3_d2u3v3,1568240836.0,"It basically feels like my life is over. You just spend most of your days on work and when you get home have but a couple of hours left for chores and basic necessities and then go to sleep. It is a soul crushing experience especially because there is nothing in my future to look forward to, no reason why I'm doing all of this, work is my life now."
Anxiety,ezmccj3,t3_d1j68i,1567989951.0,Im sorry you have to go through that. I wish you the best of luck.
Anxiety,ezm30ii,t3_d1id5y,1567985608.0,I often find that the moment I lie down in bed and try to fall asleep I get racing thoughts that keep me up and exhaust me. So I think that sleep has become associated with stress for me instead of it being something relaxing. I don't know what to do. Anxiety just makes you very tense and stressed throughout the day and it wreaks havoc on sleep too. Its almost like thinking and stress have become addictions and at night in bed when you aren't distracted by anything else the conditions are perfect for that.
Anxiety,ezlnroz,t3_d1bslg,1567979090.0,"Yes, the problem is that on Sundays my mind drifts off to mentally prepare towards surviving a new workweek and I try to distract myself from that but those attempts always fail. Sunday just seems like a prelude to Monday and it always feels like my free time on Sunday isn't really free time because my mind is already thinking about work."
SuicideWatch,eyo5kv2,t3_cxwp2o,1567270231.0,"I have always had a feeling that my death would be a suicide. I just don't see myself as a normal person that will ever have a normal life. I have always felt different from my peers: Incapable of enjoying the things they enjoyed. Life requires a lot of effort from me and I feel so fake and ungenuine, everyday Im just wearing a mask and going through the motions while for other people living life and enjoying it seems to come so natural. At this point Im just sticking around for the people who I know would be affected by my death and be miserable as a result.  Sometimes I wish I had never been born, it would have spared me a lot of trouble. Now I have to deal with how a decision to end my own life might affect others. I just wish there was a way to go out clean without it affecting others, to totally erase yourself as if you had never even existed. If that option was available, I would not hesitate for a moment."
depression,eydv6up,t3_cwl19g,1567025150.0,"I have thought about death a lot as well. In a strange way losing your fear of death can bring a kind of freedom that makes it easier to cope with depression and anxiety, I don't care anymore if I drop dead in the street so why should I care about something my mind is so preoccupied with at the moment? The worst thing that can happen is that I die which is not bad at all if you welcome death."
depression,exvq94y,t3_cujo33,1566604442.0,"I feel the same way. Life has become one excruciatingly boring long linear road for me at this point and Im just waiting to reach the end of that road. It has become a cycle of obligation, routine and repetition, with little that provides a real motivation. I analyze and question everything and I now see that this has been my greatest vulnerability. Nothing satisfies or excites me because my mind deconstructs everything to the point that nothing has any real meaning. The only way I can function is on auto pilot when I just shut off my mind and pretty much focus on some task ahead with tunnel vision, which I can only do for a limited amount of time because of my inclination to overthink. An end to all the madness seems very tempting, I just don't enjoy life and I think I never will. Going through years and years of the same before I reach the end seems pointless."
SuicideWatch,exst4fd,t3_ctz0mq,1566555860.0,"I have long since given up on relationships and marriage. It is difficult enough for me to deal with myself and my own problems, having another person come in and complicate it would just make things worse and would neither be good for me nor her. Not that I would know how to start a relationship in the first place because I am absolutely clueless. Slowly I am accepting thats just the way it is. I am made for the solitary life, a partner would just be a burden for me."
SuicideWatch,exrdyvy,t3_ctzf0j,1566515168.0,"I've had a similar life path. I can't even remember the last time I was really happy, I don't even hope for happiness anymore. The best I can hope for is to feel numb and indifferent or life will become unbearable for me."
