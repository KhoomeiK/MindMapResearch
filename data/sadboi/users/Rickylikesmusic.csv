Drugs,f85x0fl,t1_f85wymg,1574285015.0,Codeine
Drugs,f7flzzz,t1_f7fllnj,1573682290.0,Maybe. Someone else said it might have  been a cathinone like 3mmc or MDPV. But the effects lasted longer than what 3mmc is supposed to.
Drugs,f7fh9ks,t1_f7fh2cy,1573679365.0,Ok. I'm gonna research that. Yikes. It did not feel like what I thought ecstasy was supposed to feel like
schizophrenia,f7fgl85,t3_dvy2ka,1573678951.0,That's awesome. Congratulations
mentalhealth,f7fgjpo,t3_dvvrff,1573678925.0,Thank you so much.
schizophrenia,f7fgiii,t3_dvuxpe,1573678905.0,That seems like ignorance. Although I went through a major religious breakthrough during an episode. It didnt last. I'm kind of glad. It was embarrassing.
Drugs,f7f5rcr,t1_f7f0fx3,1573673029.0,Oh. I get that. I just didnt expect the come up to feel so good and then for the peak to be so explosive. I thought it would be weaker than that. I wish I knew what it was exactly. It was called After. Some people know what they are getting. I didnt because the guy would not tell me. He said it would get copied. He then said that coca cola doesnt tell people the ingredients because then they would all make coke. Im never doing that again.
Drugs,f7ew4r8,t1_f7ew0m1,1573667108.0,Yeah. Most people say those dont work. Leaving out the ingredients was weird to me.
Drugs,f7eujdq,t1_f7eu1y3,1573666112.0,Yeah. It was a pill though. Also it was from a legal highs website. The guy said the real ingredients were a trade secret.
Drugs,f7ete1y,t1_f7eex8o,1573665393.0,"I tried fake ecstasy and I'm pretty sure it was speed. That shit made me stay up for 24 hours. I had already been up for 12 before that. I liked it but it made me feel panicky and want to redose. It felt that amazing. 

I like opiates. I'm thinking of getting kratom."
AskReddit,f7et33m,t3_dvj5tl,1573665203.0,"Being way too clingy. I dated a guy who was very very clingy. I thought he was exaggerating when he said he was clingy, at first. He wanted to talk to me all the time. He always walked way too close to me. He needed to know where I was and what I was doing most of the time. It turns out he had Autism. I dont know if that's a valid excuse though."
Drugs,f7e13s8,t1_f7camhf,1573641104.0,"Yes. This! It's actually quite a horrible feeling. For me it turned into wanting to tie my hands up because I just would always say things were better if I just took a pill or 2 or 3 or 4. I could never win. I don't know how I will deal if I ever get more surgery. I would want to throw the bottle away but then I would probably take it out, if I did throw it away. Its hell. I had issues with pills and stuff since I was 14. It did start really slow."
Drugs,f728n52,t3_du3qlc,1573355770.0,"No, you'd be unconscious."
schizophrenia,f6y09ll,t3_dtjgs0,1573263789.0,I relate to this so much
Drugs,f6v7iu9,t3_dt3d8h,1573178673.0,"DXM- I took a lot of dxm. At one point I turned into a bridge that was really high up and tons of people were walking on me. It was weird. 

I once thought my arms were being ripped off because they were shrinking. I thought I was being dragged to the ceiling.

DPH- I was talking to a lady sitting on my bed. I didnt like what she was talking about so I mumbled later. She had never been there. 

Gravol-My head turned into what felt like a radio.

Weed- I thought I was on a TV show and people were laughing at me while watching 
TV. 

Codeine/Tramadol- Got really sedated and my breathing slowed and my heart was beating weird. I was so high I didnt really understand the situation until afterwards. 

Tramadol- Got  sedated from about 4 pills and my sister and younger cousin came into the room I was sleeping in to tell me they thought an owl flew into their bedroom and touched them. I was so high and my pupils were tiny. They didnt notice though. It was a weird situation. It ended up being the cat. 

Shrooms-took a lot for my first time. The walls were moving a lot. The stairs were shrinking and growing. I saw faces in the ceiling. I read a book with my eyes closed and the words became a jumble in my mind. I woke up from the sensation of falling as well. It was amazing.

Fake Ecstasy- took this pill I got from some friend who bought it from a head shop online. It got me very very high. I thought I had peaked but then the peak came and it was intense as hell. I thought I had peaked when I wanted to dance a lot. But then I got really really energized. I ended up not sleeping at all that night. I emailed the guy from the head shop telling him how amazing his product was. I felt amazing. I wanted to take more. Then it took a weird turn. I started to feel anxious and paranoid as well as sweaty. My teeth were clenched the whole time. The effects lasted for over 12 hours. I had weird waking dreams during the night. I feel weird for sending the guy an email. I felt the most euphoric I had ever felt. Apparently that stuff is legal. I asked the guy what the ingredients were. He told me they were a trade secret. Other people might copy it. To this day I dont know what was in that pill. But I want more."
schizophrenia,f6nzwj4,t3_ds5yn7,1573004266.0,I feel the same
schizophrenia,f6nzqas,t3_ds3v2r,1573004139.0,Thank you
mentalhealth,f6nzoic,t3_ds61uh,1573004103.0,That's really good that you did that.
schizophrenia,f6ikytq,t3_drgfxj,1572880245.0,"You could maybe try smoking less weed. Drinking water can help if you feel overwhelmed. It's something to grab and it feels nice to drink something cold. Only smoke weed when you are in a good mood. I noticed that when I smoked during a high anxiety time, it caused stuff to happen. I dont smoke it anymore though. Also if you find yourself in a moment where you feel really out of it, it helps to grab onto something or to remind yourself of where you are. You could try to list 3 things you can see and a few things you can feel. That helped me a few times. If you aren't enjoying it at all though, I would suggest you stop smoking it."
schizophrenia,f6hot2f,t3_drd5v4,1572859594.0,I used to do this everytime I got way too high on edibles. But that's about it.
mentalhealth,f6fxcmt,t3_dqx6i3,1572819200.0,Yes. My parents are like this. I live with different relatives now. My parents visited me yesterday and told me all the stuff I should be doing and that I was lazy for not having a job. My dr told me I'm not fit to work right now. My parents also mentioned that I shouldn't be wearing pajamas during the day. I know it is hard for them but it is also really hard for me. They expect me to just recover after taking meds.
schizophrenia,f6dkahs,t3_dr0bav,1572794877.0,Yes. I'm much better at typing. Some days I just feel like I cant form words at all.
schizophrenia,f6afdco,t3_dqsfte,1572756083.0,Yea. I did badly in grade 12 because I couldn't focus or do my work. I ended up staring into the corner or outside during most classes. I could barely move sometimes or think to do my work. Class stressed me out because I had a teacher who hated me. I feel embarrassed though because I had some kind of episode in his class that resulted in me feeling really numb and like I was spinning. I ended up peeing my pants. I could barely do school. It got too hard for me to focus on and I just stopped caring. I do feel stupid because I did so bad. I was used to better grades.
schizophrenia,f6aefua,t1_f69u5hs,1572755703.0,"Yeah. I am doing what I feel like right now. Thank you. I hope it is better tomorrow, too. I feel sad today. I feel like my parents are ashamed of me. They never seem to want me around. When I was home they always wanted to me go to the hospital or respite care. But then I would go to the hospital and they would miss me and want me home early. I dont understand them sometimes."
schizophrenia,f6adrui,t1_f69xo6y,1572755433.0,Yeah. My parents are the ones who originally took me to the doctor for my symptoms. I don't understand how they dont understand it more. It's like they are ashamed of me.
schizophrenia,f69qii4,t3_dqqxzz,1572745651.0,I really like that. I like bracelets.
schizophrenia,f68old2,t3_dqhczq,1572730399.0,Thank you. I almost forgot to take my pill yesterday. I have to take it at the same time everyday. I dont feel any effects yet. It will take 2-6 weeks. I had a rough day today. I had a bad meeting with my parents.
AskReddit,f62031x,t1_f61yjhn,1572650781.0,"Yeah. It's kind of nice. It still feels unpleasant in the morning. No matter how much water I drank at night. I once drank 8-10 shots of whiskey and felt awful the next morning, still kind of drunk and I went to my summer job for 6 hours. I didnt throw up once though."
AskReddit,f61oetw,t1_f60nfee,1572643432.0,Yeah. I agree. The weirdest thing for me when I was 16 though was that I could drink a ton without throwing up. I have still never thrown up from Alcohol.
AskReddit,f61o0oe,t3_dq2m27,1572643258.0,"I have a problem with opiate pain killers. I had a near death experience with codeine and tramadol when I was 17. Nobody that I know, knows about it. My heart slowed down. The scariest thing about it was how good it felt. I couldn't stop falling asleep and then I decided to sit up. I didnt realize what was happening. I knew it was bad though. I feel like an awful person. My grandma would have found me in a coma."
schizophrenia,f5yaqk8,t3_dppy67,1572553344.0,Halloween  is tough this year. It's my first since being diagnosed. I used to like it so much.
schizophrenia,f5xbk9g,t3_dpl40b,1572538343.0,Yes. All the time. They are always very weird
schizophrenia,f5rl3e4,t3_doqvqx,1572396882.0,16-17. I had symptoms of depression and substance abuse since I was 14 though.
schizophrenia,f5rksfj,t3_dovaec,1572396677.0,I got into religion quite heavily. I talked about it a lot. It got to a point where people avoided me at school. Then I thought it was because they just didnt understand. I went to church before and then I felt a bit uneasy. Then I thought I had too much satan in me. Then I thought I had Hell and Heavenly things in me. I would think I was an Angel. It creeped people out to the point where I was a loner at school. I feel embarrassed about it now. Sometimes I still feel it but I have more insight. I also told people about my past lives theories. That's too elaborate for some people. People started to avoid me more. I also have written people notes and messages because I felt empowered by God.
schizophrenia,f5rjzgl,t3_doyatx,1572396135.0,Thank you for this.
schizophrenia,f5rjihl,t3_doof8b,1572395823.0,This sounds like something I want to try. Showers are stressful for me. Everyone else I know seems to take a shower every day. I take showers once a week. People say I smell weird. I now use deodorant but I actually need to start showering more. Thank you for this. It sounds like it would work for me.
schizophrenia,f5rimku,t3_dowmhn,1572395241.0,I feel this exact way. I got in a fight with my mom about this today. She doesnt think I am being fully truthful with my counselor or doctor. I just really dont want to be hospitalized. My mom pushed for me to be on Abilify again. Now I am on it. I just dont like asking for meds for some reason. I feel like my counsellor is too nice to be brought into my feelings. I do try to be as honest as I can though.
schizophrenia,f5oesaj,t1_f5oel1g,1572316272.0,I have experienced the same with the tossing around and stuff. Its scary. Sleep is not easy for me.

Drugs,f5jltnt,t1_f5j8dfl,1572232222.0,Thank you. I'm working on it. Some days feel better than others. I'm working on getting meds again because I quit them. The loneliness is what gets to me. I have no friends anymore. I'm working on that though.
Drugs,f5jlj9f,t1_f5j9zfr,1572231982.0,Thank you. That's a good reminder. I'm still running and I have to always remember that and be thankful. Thank you again. This is moving.
Drugs,f5jlf54,t1_f5jd2bs,1572231886.0,Thank you. I just had to get it out. It was bugging me tonight. I'm working on that goal right now. I'm starting to go for more walks. I'm working on my diet. It's harder than I thought but also easier than I thought in a way. I saw a dietitian about it. It's hard for me to socialize currently. Every friend I have I lose because of my mental illness. I'm working on getting medication currently. Thank you again. This actually really helped me realize that I am working on getting on the right path. Some days I just forget that.
Drugs,f5jl3k5,t1_f5jh390,1572231625.0,That's really good that you cleaned up your act. I hope you continue to feel better.
Drugs,f5jkzg6,t1_f5jkosm,1572231526.0,I never thought they would affect me so hard.
Drugs,f5j3m0h,t3_dnzkv1,1572220849.0,Weed. Dont try pills ever. I started those when I was 14. Worst decision of my life.
schizophrenia,f4xhvke,t3_dm508v,1571865719.0,That's awesome. Showers can feel very refreshing. It's a struggle sometimes though.
mentalhealth,f4nh45e,t1_f4ndtgd,1571689381.0,Thank you. Yeah. The shower actually felt really nice. It was hard but worth it. I feel better when I am clean. Yeah. I think it will be better tomorrow. Thank you for not thinking I am a loser.
schizophrenia,f4nglbf,t1_f4newvn,1571689226.0,Yeah. I have a doctors appointment on Thursday. I'm going to mention. I know my relatives/ caretakers want me to.

schizophrenia,f4943lf,t3_djsfpl,1571456414.0,"It has. Everytime I think about getting a job, I start to feel really anxious. I had a summer job when my symptoms started showing. I was constantly feeling extremely stressed and I couldn't sleep. Faces everywhere and weird dreams."
schizophrenia,f493xkk,t3_djw5js,1571456303.0,"I want a non judgemental response. I dont want to be rejected. I want to know that I have someone who  I can trust. 
 
Most people say stuff like ""oh, I see"" ask me a lot of questions about it. Some people romanticize it and say they think it is cool. It makes me a bit mad each time. Then there are people who slowly cut off contact with me or ghost me."
schizophrenia,f48th9v,t1_f48ltpi,1571448435.0,"Yeah, I feel like my moments of word salad and talking too much, made my friend realize I had a mental illness. He didnt really understand that at first. 

I want to talk to him about it. I just dont know what to say. I talked to him about my symptoms before and he didnt want to talk about it. He is  a good friend but he is a bit influenced by his mom. It's only him and her. I want to apologize and explain what I was going through. He tells everything to his mom though. He has Autism. I'm more patient with him because of it but recently I feel like I am not heard."
schizophrenia,f4818z0,t1_f480ges,1571431037.0,Yeah. He normally talks to me everyday though. He also left me on read yesterday. I'm staying calm though. I hope he is really my friend. Hes my only friend. I dont really know what I did to make his mom not like me.
schizophrenia,f4026zz,t1_f401cij,1571282776.0,Thank you. Yeah. I saw a doctor today about my diet. I'm  a bit overweight but I'm working on losing weight now and surprisingly I dont feel so down about it. I did laugh during the appointment and it was a bit weird. I feel better about my health now. I also have an appointment with my regular doctor. My Aunt or Mom has to go in with me that time. Then I am set up for 16 counseling sessions and emergency counseling if I need it. I feel like I am slowly gaining control again. But I still struggle. I just have to work on getting through that. I'm happy to not feel like I did the other night.
schizophrenia,f3zzbxz,t1_f3zyn5i,1571280563.0,"Oh. That's comforting. I just feel so fast. I think I drank too much coffee. 2 cups is a lot within an hour. It's not very fun. Some people think it would be, to feel this energetic. It starts out ok but ends kind of badly. It doesn't happen often. I want to throw up to be honest. I feel like cutting my hair and running outside. I just need to lay down with a weighted blanket and breathe in and out. Usually someone sits by my bed and rubs my hand, when I feel this way. It's to keep me grounded. This makes me wonder why there are people who romanticize this."
schizophrenia,f3zvpx9,t3_disb4m,1571278129.0,Go see a psychiatrist. That sounds scary.
schizophrenia,f3zvnsy,t3_diq9tv,1571278088.0,I feel the same way but then I talk to people and do not want to be around them. It's not a fun feeling. I cant stand to be with my thoughts but being around people stresses me out. I'm having issues with a friend right now due to his mom and stigma. She doesn't get a good vibe from me. Her son is my only friend

Drugs,f3uujyi,t1_f3ufht8,1571167611.0,"I agree with this. I thought I would only take an extra 1 or 2 codeine pills every once in a while. That turned into me taking 2-4 of them every night until the bottle was mysteriously gone. I also had the same with a relatives codeine and tramadol. I crave that spacey feeling and not feeling worries. It's not a great idea to try them casually, in my opinion. I thought I would just do that. I dont consider myself an addict though. I just crave distraction."

Drugs,f3szxub,t1_f3szshg,1571113762.0,I was drinking it out of a water bottle. The opening was wide and I didnt realize how fast it could come out. It got on my face and in my nose.
Drugs,f3szlk6,t1_f3szdh6,1571113463.0,"Yeah, sort of. I did feel spacey. My palms got very sweaty though. I wouldn't really reccomend it. It hurts. I did it with pure dxm syrup by accident once and it felt weird. It causes dissociative stuff."
schizophrenia,f3swc0z,t1_f3sw7mh,1571110845.0,Thank you. I have a light near my bed. I'm going to turn it on. Breathing is helping.
Drugs,f3sajfo,t3_dhw8oi,1571099683.0,Opiates and Weed. I cant use them though. I miss them. I almost wish I could get a tooth removed or something. I used to love weed so much. It made me feel so funny and relaxed. Now it kind of became an addiction. I would smoke too much. I would get uncomfortably high on purpose. It also exacerbates my paranoia. Opiates are just dangerous for me. I knew that the first time I took pills. I felt like I was in a place where everything was ok and I loved it. I would definitely do that again and again. The Warmth and spacing in and out is amazing. The way nothing matters but the moment and the fact that every issue is gone. The comedown and constipation is not fun though. But it becomes ok. I don't think I would ever touch Heroin though.
Drugs,f3s8xqd,t3_dht62n,1571098939.0,I found a ton of pills at a relative's house. I don't even think they knew they had them. I found a bottle full of Tramadol. I was looking for DXM. I found that instead and opened it. That was after I decided it was too risky to keep stealing codeine. I was 16. I also once found an empty dxm bottle and it still had a syrupy coating in it. I filled it with water and drank some of it. I snorted the rest. I also found a bunch of benadryl and went on a binge. That stuff isn't very fun though. I just couldn't stop taking it though.

schizophrenia,f31vpgj,t1_f31ugz6,1570586023.0,I feel that way too. I constantly feel like people are talking about me. I feel like they know what my diagnosis is and they are judging me for not having a job and for dressing the way I do. I feel like they can just tell things about me. Somedays I just want to stay in bed all day. Even then I feel it though. I feel like people know and judge how many times I pee during the day. I just have to ignore it all. The doctors office is the most stressful though. I feel like everyone knows I am there for mental health reasons and not physical reasons. Maybe it's the way I dress or the way I act. I drink a lot of water there. Sometimes I laugh for no reason too. Nobody else feels this way. My friend never feels this much stress while out. That causes me more stress. I feel like I ruin peoples good times.

When I was not doing well I once walked up to a friend and asked them to ask their friend who wasn't at school, if they could be my partner for a project. It took me a while because for some reason I couldn't get my words out and I burst out laughing. It went on for almost a minute. My friend had to ask me if I was alright. This has happened a few times. It makes people feel very uncomfortable. Sometimes I also randomly start crying in the same situation. That also makes people feel uncomfortable."
schizophrenia,f2yzase,t1_f2xqp2z,1570502121.0,Thank you
AskReddit,f2xvhbw,t1_f2xsame,1570483012.0,Thank you for believing me. I don't know what to do when all the blood tests show up negative. I have been tested so many times. The only thing I have had is a bladder infection and an iron deficiency. Its concerning especially because I scratch my skin a lot. To the point I have scabs. Its itchy. Anti histamines dont work. I'm getting more itchy every time I go to my friends house. He admits his dog has a flea problem. Nobody believes me that it could be that.
schizophrenia,f2xumq0,t1_f2xtsoq,1570482720.0,"Yeah. That's exactly how I feel. My last job which was a summer job I started showing minor symptoms. I realized it was not normal to think that people thought I was ripping them off by rounding up the cents they owe. For example instead of 7.34 it would be ,$7.35. I would round down sometimes instead. For cents ending in 33, I would say 30 cents. I was scared. I also had so much anxiety dealing with people for 5-7 hours a day for 5 days in a row. I don't know how my paranoia will be. Also sometimes people comment that I behave weird or that I make people feel uncomfortable."
AskReddit,f2xtpvr,t3_dek3mc,1570482413.0,"Red on a traffic light means go. Green means stop. Stop signs are green. Lemons are green. Limes are yellow. The simpsons are now green. Ketchup is blue.  Mustard is Red. All chocolate is now white. Pepsi and Coke are now clear. Purple means sadness, Yellow means Anger, Red means Happiness, and Blue means Envy. Orange is associated with feeling sick. Blood is both blue and red depending on where you get cut. Apples are orange and oranges are now red or green. People start to question why the color orange is called Orange when Oranges are Purple."
AskReddit,f2xqz08,t1_f2xkeaw,1570481510.0,That must be very frustrating. I deal with the same things. It gets to the point where people just tell me they cant deal with me. They want me to just be fine. Also I have issues with people not believing me when I have physical issues because I have phantom aches a lot. It's really invalidating and has made me scared to tell people about pain.
schizophrenia,f2xbvvo,t3_delntx,1570476081.0,Yes. It made me feel guilty and sad. I dont have that as much now though.
schizophrenia,f2icsol,t1_f2ic7kf,1570255400.0,Yeah. I'm worried about that too. He lives with his mom though. He doesn't have much ambition to move out. He has a job though. He also has Autism. I don't know a lot about that. I do know that he has a hard time finding jobs. I can relate to that. He works about 9 hours a week. I do enjoy spending time with him. I just sometimes worry about his situatio. It makes me feel  a bit uneasy because I feel like he isn't telling me the truth about certain things .
schizophrenia,f2i6yd1,t1_f2i64gx,1570253064.0,Yeah. I am spending 4 days away from him. Maybe the itch will stop for a while. It's a weird place to visit and it heightens my paranoia but I try to be nice to him. He sleeps on just a mattress because his bed broke. I offered to help him clean his room but he doesnt want me to see it because its embarrassing for him. He said it's mostly just dirty clothes. I dont mind that because my room gets dirty easily when I am not feeling well. I tried to give him advice about his laundry and room because I have managed to clean my very messy room before but he just brushes me off. I'm starting to kind of feel worried about him.
