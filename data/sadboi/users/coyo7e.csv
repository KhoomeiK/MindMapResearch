IWantToLearn,ez41psj,t3_czyayf,1567679407.0,"Hmm, not sure how much I can get into with a couple decades of rust on my wheels, but the main thing to almost ANY tasting of beverages, is to learn ""the slurp.""

When you sip coffee/tea/soup/etc, you are SUPPOSED to ""slurp"" it loudly into your mouth. This action ""aerates"" the liquid and allows you to absorb more of the flavor (I think hipsters call them flavinoids or something these days..) through your upper palette. If you don't understand the physics and effect of a good loud slurp, you'll never know how broad a flavor vairety it contains though.

So if you want to learn to properly taste coffee or tea etc, make a bunch of cups of different kids and then get a bunch of clean spoons, and a spitoon..! You want to ladle one spoonful into your mouth (away from your face) and then bring it toward your mouth before inhaling it in as you do ,so so it basically ""sprays"" the inside of your mouth as widely as possible (it takes a little practise to not choke yourself accidentally, lol!) Do this activity with any friends/family you know who'd be interested as well - you're not there to drink a cup of coffee/tea, you're there to inhale one teaspoon of each cup just so you can identify the flavor notes.. Get some drastically different ones too - rooibos, white, green, black, pu-erh if you can afford, etc... For cofee, get at least one decent quality from every continent you can, and then get a couple of different colors of roast (the darkness of roast drastically affects flavor and the amount of caffeine that ends up in your drink, be it coffee or tea.) You are teaching your senses and you shouldn't skimp any more than you have to.

After learning this tasting , it's just a bit of education on what kind of drying techniques and harvesting techniques etc, come into play (My personal favorite are many african roasts, because they're dried almost literally on the bare earth, and they pick up a lot of that earthy flavor which I love on the same level as Genmai Cha for a comfort drink).

I went through Starbucks training many years back - we watched the videos and had to make and drink EVERY goddamned drink in the place in a couple days - but the only thing I still carry with me is how to slurp a beverage or soup properly in order to be both the highest of etiquette, and to get the broadest flavor palatte! (also how long is an acceptable window to allow espresso to brew  before throwing out the drink and the tamp)

There are probably youtube videos on how to properly ?""slurp"" taste tea and coffees and other drinks - many professional spit he sip out immediately as well though which isn't necessary for amateurs .. I've had to taste literally 2 dozen coffee drinks in a 4 hour period and ended up actually ill after the caffeine crash, and if you tried to taste-test whiskey or vodka like this without spitting every taste out  you'd probably die real quick..

Honestly if you really really care, I'd recommend getting a job at a starbucks or dutch bros for 2 or 3 months just so you can get a feel for the variety of tastes etc. If yo can get hold of their corprorate training videos for barista though - that's the good stuff where you will realize JUST HOW FAR OUT THERE those experts can get.

To quote the old starbucks training movie I was forced to watch, (which was like 90 minutes long) ""We take the beans to the edge of the cliff -the we PULL EM BACK!!!""

You kind of have to get hardcore into it if you want to learn and be an expert, so be warned. ;) Also apologies - I drink way more tea than cofee, so I probably forgot to keep saying ""coffeee"" at some point. It all applies equally once you learn to train your palette and spit it out before you absorb too much of what's in it, though"

When I got my rescue she was fat as a house and named ""Biscuit,"" even thought she literally does not eat her food until she's hungry - if you ""prime"" her by giving her too many treats then she'll eat everything in sight until she can't stand up any longer..!

I'm sure that Moose is a fine name but you may want to take into consideration that a name like that is going to make many people who encounter him, assume that he's headstrong, possibly slow/stubborn at learning, and he's likely just a very active young boy who's under-stimulated and who'll need a lot of training before you can trust him to he level you desire!

I had a Corgi growing up who pulled like a freight train but nobody cared because she wasn't big enough to be impossible to handle, but my Labrador was 110 lbs of pure energy and I had to do a lot of leash work with her to get her to be safe on a lead.. The main thing was using a 15 foot leash to train her that she'd get a nasty clothesline if she ran too far forward and lost track of who was holding her, and a 6 foot leash when actually walking. It took several months of dog training classes and easily an hour+ each day, but she ended up being amazing - her name was ""Ce'Nedra"" after a fiery-tempered princess from a David Eddings novel I'd read when I was little. ;)

There are also special collars (called ""Halty"" collars, iirc?) which run from the dog's neck and up over their muzzle, and if they pull too heard then the way the collar is designed, it pulls their head to the side and prevents them from using their whole strength to fight against the checking with your lead.. You really might think about something like that in the meantime because a young strong dog like that can be a danger to you, himself, and other dogs and people if you can't hold him back during a crisis moment - he could very easily get into or pull YOU into traffic, or get injured by an aggressive dog, or knock down a child or elderly person, etc, which are all terrifying scenarios for a dog owner imho!
