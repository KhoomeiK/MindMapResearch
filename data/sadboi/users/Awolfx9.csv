Animemes,fnx2j2h,t3_g4ab4l,1587330202.0,Honestly I liked the story up until the show threw this major curveball into the mix. I thought the finale was gearing up towards some kind of revolt against “Father” and the people in charge so the kids could break the chains of being used like tools. But then it becomes all about aliens that had no foreshadowing at all up to when they’re revealed. I still liked the show for the most part though.
