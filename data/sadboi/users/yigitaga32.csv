First of all, I don't have any diagnosed mental issue and I would like to ask that while staying at home during quarantine I always feel I am disconnected from life and I  sometimes feel like life is flowing somewhere but I am out of that.  Besides I sometimes can't stop my urge to talk-call anyone with no reason; a lot of people I called were busy with life. I know its true but I'm incline to take it personally,  and really missing daily small talk."

In my angle it seems like a bit laziness, you are too young and its okay to  feel you are comparing yourself with your peers. But its too early to decide you are worse than others. So my advice to you my friend, spend your youth with enjoy. Do something what makes you happy. Start to take responsibility of something like pursuing success. Dedicate yourself something worth. For instance if you love to read Russian literature classics, consider  learning Russian. Your age is the most talented period for cultivation. Life is full of opportunities and even if you fail you are not destined to be successful.  So find something worth defending"

AskHistorians,fclx79i,t3_e7eixo,1577758663.0,"Yes, especially after Tanzimat reforms(1839) the country itself turned his face towards West, and with the Crimean War, The Turks were an ally of Western Powers. Grand Vizier Reşid Paşa, who was ambassador in Paris and London in his early years he fathomed that Empire can not keep up without foreign help and he tried to make benefit from his era's balance of power. His and other outstanding ministers such as Âli, Fuad and Midhat Paşa's efforts to make empire Westernized are undeniable. (by the way, he is encouraged by Sultan Mahmud II to studying French. It's crucial because, with Tanzimat reforms, Ottoman literary/intelligentsia language was changed from Persian to French) Treaty of Berlin was membership of Ottomans to the western block. Also, Sultan Abdulaziz's Travel to Europe in 1867 was the first and most important tour of Sultans in the Empire's history. There is a rumor here - one of the royals(prince) desired to get married to the crown prince, Murad the V. But sultan refused it.-The tours timing is not a coincidence, it's a heading to the West for the sake of empire. After the Tanzimat era 39-76, it ceased because of wars and end of the support of the UK-France against Russians. But the westernization process was continued too."
