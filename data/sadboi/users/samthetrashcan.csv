creepy,fos87xm,t3_e2x1yz,1588025748.0,"I'm absolutely disgusted. my dad has a farm where we have chickens. we get every month or so aboug 65000 of them as they're really young and yellow, cute, and grow them for about three weeks until they are taken to be slaughtered. it's pretty sad but it's life. but our spaces are not like this, god no. we have about 13000 chickens per room, and the rooms are massive. the floor is covered with turf/muck, whatever its called, they have rotating food thingys and water, and they're all free to move wherever they want. the temperature is about 30 degrees Celsius when they're young, and towards the end around 25 i think. my dad works really fucking hard with all that and in between ""batches"" of birds the rooms have to be emptied, washed, disinfected and filled with turf again. hygiene is probably the most important thing to my dad, he always carries around hand sanitizer (even before this corona stuff) and always reminds us of germs. when going to see the birds you have to wash your hands before and after, have clean clothes and feet, etc.

i dont know why i just typed this, just felt like saying they're not all cruel i guess."

I'm kind of worried for them, like, where are they getting all that from? what are they into and how desensitised must they be by now? idk. but i sure as hell know that one day they sent the video of people getting hit by cars fatally, getting shot, cutting libs off, etc, to a well known song that i cant remember right now."
