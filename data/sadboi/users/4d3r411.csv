BPD,fqrmlcn,t3_gkjerd,1589587414.0,"Hi!! I'm poly with BPD. Are you mono in a poly relationship? Or both of you are poly?

Somehow I've made it work with my primary but bpd had made it harder to keep up with other partners bc I guess my primary is my FP too. He has two other partners besides me, which I love but I'll admit when he was trying to get with someone new who had the same hairstyle and food problems (but did both better) (doing the food problem better as in she had control and is so skinny and besides bpd, food is my worst problem so anything to do with it spirals me off the edge) I did get really upset. But to be fair I was going through an abortion/pregnancy thing.

Poly can be for people with BPD, but yes, it is harder. Working with dbt will help you! Finding a good balance is possible."

Don't know my relationship life so why would you judge it... I should've posted in the poly thread instead because at least they won't reject me for having bpd. Maybe you had a fake poly experience and that's why you reject it for Other people? You shouldn't call people ""cheating bastards"" for loving in a different way than you."

polyamory,fm6vu7y,t1_fm6v8id,1585804736.0,"He has unprotected sex with her, he refused to wear condoms so I assume she knows but doesn't think about it because she doesn't want to know he is with anyone else. He doesn't care about Corona virus and wants to catch it because he thinks he's invincible, he doesn't get sick often but he can make others sick. I (and his other partner) still have to go to work so I'm done for if I get anyone sick. He doesn't have to be outside to work and it doesn't affect him financially. I feel dumb not realizing how bad this is until today happened. I get scared about the virus but then he gets angry and says it's just the flu and ""only old people die from it""."

I don't know if he'd tell me or not because this is the first time he's gotten someone pregnant"
polyamory,fm6v6wa,t1_fm6uh9y,1585804190.0,"I kept telling him I needed him, if he could just come at least a bit earlier instead of spending the whole day till midnight to help me, and if he didn't want to tell her the truth, to just tell her I wasn't feeling well and that I needed him. She asks him to stay with her when she's feeling upset when it's our night and he does, I feel insignificant. Me and her have no communication because she's mono and with him, and she wants to pretend that he's not with anyone else but her so I'm not even on his social media posts. He keeps saying they won't be together by the end of the year because it's wearing on them both but I don't see this happening. He's recently admitted it's a codependency thing but that's about it. I wouldn't mind this relationship they have but it affects so many parts of my relationship with him, this tops the cake and I don't want to try to talk to him about it again. He's a decade older than me and he should know. :("

When I found someone who I didn't want a relationship with but had a connection he was unhappy. Now all of a sudden he's having sex with people he has a special connection with but isn't in a relationship in. Poly was new to me so I spent the year in this thread learning and .. yeah. It's just new to me
polyamory,fl934g7,t3_fne1kc,1584939478.0,"This is just new to me, it was so sudden, somehow I feel cheated on. He has a special connection with all of his friends. He kissed one of my friends that he just met who was visiting for the day because he felt he was having a moment with her when she was on shrooms and drank a lot. He drank a few shots too but was very aware of the moment. I feel like this connection is loose. Maybe I'm just venting I'm sorry."

There's a bully at work I always had a feeling she disliked me, we closed together and she straight up said she doesnt, doesn't like how bubbly I am, we don't ""vibe"", and that I get in her bubble. Exact words. Then she intimidated me into leaving an hour early. I nearly quit, I've worked there 4 years and twice as long as her but... I love my job. I'm really good at it, it's one of the reasons I'm still alive. The days I have to work with her I have to take xanax but other days are a breeze. I've talked to my bosses about it and since then I've gotten stronger but there are times I just need to take a 15 and scream in the bathroom."
