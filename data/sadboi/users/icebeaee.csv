Your parents do care about you. Maybe, it’s just that during this pandemic, people including your parents are constantly worrying. Millions are unemployed, millions are starving, people are fighting over masks and food in certain areas, thousands are dying each day. It creates a stress attack for many of us.

For us students, most of us are used to going to school and meeting our friends, going to clubs, hanging out in the café, etc. It’s alright to feel this way sometimes, don’t let it overthrow you though. There are ways to change those thoughts and feelings. You can either start journaling, diary writing, drawing, playing sports inside your home with your younger siblings, FaceTime your friends and/or girlfriend. Download nice mobile multiplayer apps, constantly keep finding new ways to entertain yourself. And try to keep your head high, hopes high, everything high, ok? We are all in this together."

I think it’d be best if you exercise maybe in the park, around that area like you’ve mentioned. I don’t think people would peak from their window houses to stare at someone exercising. I don’t think anyone would mind. So it’s okay for you to exercise in a park. On those days that I workout, I don’t ever wear any nice workout clothes. As long as you are dressed in comfy clothes that are baggy and stretchy, that is fine as well. 

There are some great YouTube workout tutorials. Like the quick 7-minute workouts to burn this amount of calories, etc. For me, I enjoy jogging in one place, especially if you can’t go to the gyms during no treadmill. Or maybe you could do planks after finished with jogging. Then after planks, do, squats, scrunches with your leg held up high and drop them to the ground.

If that doesn’t work out..

2) Schedule a plan with your grandmother. Both of you sit down and talk about any solutions that’ll fix the problem. Tell your grandmother that her food tastes very delicious, and so on. Later on, tell her that you’d love to eat more of her food, but you can’t because of the pain you have to go through after eating those foods. Describe the pain as something excruciating, so that hopefully, she will learn to sympathize with you. And hopefully, she will not mind if you buy your own healthy food. So basically this is more of a straightforward advice-ish. 

If that doesn’t work out..

3) Tell your grandmother you’re getting sick of the food that she’s been making. And introduce your grandmother to some YouTube tutorial healthy cooking videos. The ones that look very appetizing and just ahhh!! Maybe that could inspire your grandmother to cook different types of varieties of foods for you and herself! 

If that doesn’t work out..

4) Tell your grandmother, straight up, that she should eat more healthy foods. Since at her age, it’s unhealthy to eat those foods. Tell your grandmother that you love her, and care for her health as well. Maybe she’ll change.


That’s all I got I guess.

Unless, once you save up, you can move out? If that is an option for you. I don’t know, but yeah I hope one or more of the advice helps for you. Good luck!"

Love yourself for who you are, can’t let their words define you. And basically be very low maintenance. Stay chill and don’t give a flying fluckadoo about your haters. They don’t matter.

I don’t think I have much great advice to offer, but maybe, just maybe, you could set a schedule for you to finish your assignments on time. Turn in all your late assignments. And in between, take some breaks and chill. Turn on some nice relaxing music, like depressing songs or music that’ll fit with your mood while you’re doing your assignments. I don’t know, but that’s what I do and it helps with how I’m feeling. I put on the most depressing songs ever, and it helps me. It doesn’t help much if I put happy songs. 

There are only couple of weeks away from graduation, so I know you can do it. Believe in yourself. I believe in you regardless I don’t know you much. Don’t look at the stack of assignments assigned to you yet, just tackle them down one by one until the end. You’ll see you’ve accomplished all of it. 

As for your depression, you could contact online therapists to help you with how you’re feeling. Maybe they can help. If not, find a hobby that makes you feel relaxed. Any hobby, like writing, gaming, reading, washing dishes. Just something to get your mind off of the heavy dark fog sadness feeling out of your mind temporarily.

The guiltiness would probably eat them up in the end. And maybe they’ll use that guilty feeling to actually try to be more remorseful and transform themselves into more of a good human being. Maybe.. you taught them a lesson sorta? I don’t know where I’m going with this, but I basically just believe in karma. Karma will get your bullies back in return.

Don’t think too much of your ex-friends anymore. They kicked you out of their social group, so you kick them out of your personal life as well. So try not to take it in so personally. During this time, I feel like it would be best for you to focus on yourself. What are some goals that you would like to accomplish in life? 

-Wanting a healthier and muscle-y body? Go for it! 
-Writing a whole book or diary when you’re feeling low or bored? Go for it
-Cleaning the entire house while jamming to your epic playlist of songs? Go for it
-Binge watch all your favorite episodes on Netflix, YouTube? Go for it
 
Just focus on yourself and don’t give *a care* about no one else except for your parents and real family.

I wish you good luck in life, I really want you to rethink about everything, your decisions, and the consequences when you die. Love ya, from a stranger 💜"

SuicideWatch,fnqqw5q,t3_g3dzaq,1587170253.0,"There are other alternatives rather than cutting yourself. Trust me, so manyyy other alternatives rather than hurting yourself. I hate to hear and see people cutting themselves, it’s not worth it, it makes me sad, regardless whether I don’t know you personally. 

Open up a diary on your phone or whether a notebook in real life. Draw your emotions onto some piece of paper, spill your emotions on those pieces, let it flow. This works because I’ve been where you were and I know that painful feeling. I hated it. But now I hate these scars that I have, I have to cover it up. I never thought about the consequences of my actions after cutting myself. 

I draw and write how I feel. I hope you can do the same or find a better alternative which doesn’t involve hurting yourself. I doubt the people hate you this much. You’re loved and you don’t know. I am a stranger, and I want to help you out. Take care of yourself for me! Please. 💜💜"

Would it be possible for you to just type out how you feel onto your notes, and keep a diary alone in your notes? All of your emotions just spilled out into your notes on your phone. That’s what I do, I hope you take my advice and choose what is best for you. I’ve been there, I know how you feel. Good luck! Take care for me and your own mother. 💜"

Paranormal,fliwg10,t1_fliuucy,1585192408.0,"Welp, I tried to help. I do chant this when I’m in a difficult situation. Any time I try to talk about Buddhist religion to someone, they always react like you. Well, some people at least. And “fallacy in belief”? Buddhist religion is more of a teaching sentiment. I was raised up to say those words/syllables. I’m no master of knowledge when it comes to this, but Buddhist religion is bigger than you think. Almost every reply mostly here, is related to *God* anyways, so it’s not surprising I’d be attacked for introducing such an *exotic* religion in this thread. So good luck out there. Take care."
Paranormal,flg616n,t1_flfalr4,1585132104.0,"There’s Google for a reason. 

But here, I stole this from a guy on Quora who set out a basic definition for it. 


Nam-mô A-di-đà Phật is the Sino-Vietnamese version for 南无阿弥陀佛/南無阿彌陀佛 which is in turn the transliteration of Sanskrit “Namo Amitabha Buddha” (नमोअमितबुद्ध)

“Amitabha” means boundless light, infinite life and infinite wisdom and the whole thing means “Homage to the Amitabha Buddha” or “I seek refuge in the Amitabha Buddha”"
Paranormal,flf53jb,t1_flbuscv,1585098242.0,It’s Vietnamese . This is Buddhist Vietnamese words
Paranormal,flbs471,t3_fnuqwn,1585011351.0,"You should pray. My religion is Buddhist, you should chant these four words, “A Di Da Phat.” Your pronounce it like, “Ah-Yee-Dah-Fugt.” When I’m scared I chant these, but yes I believe that that could’ve been a demon. Don’t be scared, shine in light from your windows in the morning and chant those words I shared with you. It will scare away the demons."
Advice,flbrce5,t3_fnv801,1585010855.0,"I’d like to give you some advice but I, myself, am also a huge procrastinator. My grades are in the low A’s and B’s currently. 

I think the biggest problem for you that you’ve stated is the procrastination. For me, I like to get things done but in my head I always say, “Later, I’ll finish it.” Then the assignment comes near it’s own deadline then I rush it. In the end the results are like an atomic bomb. 

So for me, I always think about the consequences of what happens if I don’t follow my schedule to get things finished. For you, I think you should train your willpower by making a schedule, include in some mini breaks in between so you won’t get too stressed out. Every task that you’re finished with, check it off or cross it off. I like checking things off or crossing the words off since it tells me I have accomplished that already. Then I gain a sense of motivation in me, which helps along the way. 

Trying using your created schedule daily, hopefully this’ll work for you. I wish you the best of luck, motivate yourself, think of the consequences of what happens if you don’t finish this or that task. I believe in you, you can do it! You can get it over with, that’s the satisfaction that we all like. Good luck!!"
aspergers,flbq6qr,t3_fnvc69,1585010098.0,"Maybe, they’ve probably been through something that we do not know about. It could be something surprising that happened to them that we didn’t expect to happen to them. In general, we should be at least sympathetic for all people including our bullies. 

Bullies tend to hurt others and take others down because they’ve been hurt themselves. So for them, their gateway is to bully you and other people. Which could help them cope with their own difficulties that they’re facing. Each individual has a unique background whether it’s bad, good, or both. 

Later sometime in your lifetime, you’ll see the rewards of your sympathy you’ve given to your bullies. You just wait and be patient. Stay strong and keep your heads high."

aspergers,fkld0n8,t1_fkiu4bm,1584303660.0,"I’ve failed a basic Algebra exam *three times* already, and I don’t think I want to take it again, because I know I’ll fail it. I just don’t understand the concepts, too much logical thinking is required for the subject. Before, the whole class understood this unit problem that we all focused on. And I had no clue so I went home and had to search up YT videos on how to do it, luckily I found a very good descriptive video showing me how to do the cosine and things like that in Geometry. And when I returned back to school, a new unit popped up, as soon as I learned it. It took me like two weeks to learn that. 

I learn very, very, slow. I have to re-read, re-do, re-check multiple times, and re-listen to actually understand a certain concept. It’s so tiring, but I have to do it to be able to understand."

I work terrible when under pressure and I freak the hell out whenever someone points where something is, then my mind also goes blank. I can match a lot of my symptoms with yours. 

This could be Asperger’s because I looked up the symptoms and it listed “learning disability.”"
