There is an entire section in the novel that compares the two while Frollo is in the church. I have always found this archetype fascinating because it shows people who lived a hard life and worked with the best intentions before succumbing to desire. With Faust it was his vainity but in Frollo's case it's lust. It truly open new possibilities for creators to play around with the design and take inspiration for new characters."

But, when I felt the most confident and happy in my life was when I dropped that routine, said ""fuck it"" and was my cringy self in front of other people.

I taught a class once that asked me, ""will you teach us how to have a conversation with a complete stranger?"" They had no idea what to say or what to do when meeting someone new. Theu were, and are, afraid of what people will think of them. I tell everyone to pick a joke that becomes ""your go-to joke."" Tell this joke as an opener to break the ice. It will either do well or flop, either way smile through it. If the person laughs from genuine enjoyment ir because they think it's so bad it's funny, then you're in the clear to share more about you. If they don't, say ""fuck it"" and move on to the next person.

I still hear from them on occasion and it reminds me that I didn't need a special partner in my life to feel better; all I needed were people in my life who liked me for who I was.

1. If you get involved it becomes your drama. People can feel like it is the right thing to do but in the end you become wrapped up in everything that goes into this situation.

2. Telling will most likely end the friendship in the long run. I have not heard or witnessed many relationships that stay together after cheating. In addition to that, all those involved ""pick a side"" and friendships are ruined.

3. If these friends mean a lot to you I would focus on getting them to find help from a counselor. Just telling someone lights a fire and if you really want them to be together and happy then the central theme of your conversation meeds to be showing both of them how to move forward.

I hope this helps!"
