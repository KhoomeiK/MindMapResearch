Generally customers are allowed to add a cookie straw to their order, and we kept the same retail packaged versions behind the counter for orders like this, instead of some separately packaged SKU. When handing off the drink (in particular through the drive thru,) it would be a health and safety violation for the person at the register to touch the straw with their bare hands without first washing them and then putting on gloves. This would mean accepting payment, washing their hands since generally the exchange of money is considered unclean, putting on gloves, grabbing the straw from the container, handing all that off, taking off the gloves, washing their hands AGAIN, and then moving on to the next car. Having them wrapped simplifies it, though using plastic is ehhhh.

It's fine for them to have a place to do such things, I suppose, as venting is cathartic, but it definitely adds fuel to the stigma surrounding the disorder in some ways. I stumbled on one myself a couple days ago and it felt a bit like a kick in the stomach to see that they forbid defending people who have BPD, or even talking positively about them. Sorta like kicking someone who's down and saying they deserve it, in a way.

BorderlinePDisorder,f1a1bsl,t1_f19zcda,1569283017.0,"(posting here since I accidentally hit reply on the wrong spot lol)

No problem. 

I understand the hesitation, especially with it comes to BPD as there's still a lot of stigma and misunderstanding surrounding it. However, seeking help is nothing to really be ashamed about and the anxiety around what other people will think is understandable, but something you shouldn't let hold you back. Unmanaged/untreated illness is when things get bad and go wrong. I'm assuming that you're fairly young, unless by school you mean college? Patient confidentiality is a very serious thing in the medical world so unless you tell people what's going on it's not likely anyone will find out, or really notice. Your mental health is yours and if you aren't comfortable with bringing that into the public eye there's nothing wrong with that.

Of course, like I alluded to, you know what you're feeling better than myself. It could very well just be a minor depression episode that will improve, you might benefit from medication, therapy. However if it's something that's affecting your relationships and social life, then it's always worth speaking with a professional about, even if it feels recent or that it might pass. 

The way I look at it, if you're hurting, don't wait until it's unbearable to see about getting help. Because by the time you're in pain something is already bad, if that makes sense."

I don't really think anyone here is really qualified to say yes or no. Just that we might share some of those feelings and experiences which may or may not be a result of it. BPD is fairly complex, can appear externally as any number of things that share symptoms. 

I really strongly recommend talking with a professional and getting a proper diagnosis if it's something that you believe you might have. It can be a little bit pricey assuming you're in the US, but it's absolutely worth it. You can even come in saying that that's what you think it is to your doctor, I went in saying ""I think I have OCD."" It ended up being that I had co-morbid symptoms and that's why I thought that was the case  They will be able to confirm or provide an alternative diagnosis after a handful of visits and you explaining your situation and experiences.

BorderlinePDisorder,f0q3qxq,t1_f0q2wtq,1568853327.0,"Essentially it's just the psychological term used to describe really black-and-white thinking. Everything is either very good or extremely bad and there's not really an in-between. Generally there isn't a middle ground, and every action is either done with good intentions or bad ones. 

I generally read way too much into what people say and do and interpret it as either a very positive ""hey this person likes you and you should cling to that"" or (more often) a ""this is this person showing that they hate you and you really should just stop and leave them alone forever because clearly you're a pest."" People can't just do a thing without it being bad or good. 

It's hard to avoid for me but I'm getting better at ignoring my gut reactions to things. 

I hope that answers your question! You might be able to find more professional descriptions of it by using a search term like ""splitting psychology"" or something similar, if you want more info. I think there's a Wikipedia article but as ever, take Wikipedia with a grain of salt"

BorderlinePDisorder,f0hme6c,t3_d4xtgx,1568625837.0,"Naw, you're not alone. Everyone's experience is slightly different, but everyone can relate to something. 

For me getting the diagnosis was sort of beneficial, mostly in that it sort of put a name to what I was feeling and didn't fully understand and helped me focus my efforts in paying attention to the things I was doing and being able to pick them out and do what I could to address them. 

My gut reaction to most things is always the problematic one, letting it get the better of me. It definitely feels like what you said. There's a part of me that sees a perceived slight and interprets it as abandonment and retaliates really extremely. Pushing people away, burning bridges... Cathartic, if problematic, anger. However I often catch myself with a more reasonable, level headed me. Another part that sorta lost control of the wheel for a moment and is like ""well hold on now you're overreacting there's no way that they meant what you think they meant because why would they even do that?"" It's incredibly hard to be louder than the former, paranoid half, but that's something I work on daily and is a huge aspect of my management. 

I have a huge problem with splitting and reacting in both extremes to situations, which is something that I am (temporarily) taking a medication for since I've been in a particularly troublesome spot lately and my doctor suggested it. 

I'm a huge advocate for getting help professionally, and I hope you have access to it. But no, you aren't alone and like I said. I can relate to some of that. 

Hope this helps,"

Guildwars2,f0cl2hk,t1_f0cgxqy,1568541819.0,"It's a player retention mechanic. Whether it's an agreeable mechanic is I suppose up for debate, but it's still substantially cheaper than, say, 6 months of your typical sub fee MMO (assuming a cost of 12.99/mo.)

I think the main failing here is not the system itself, but more how that system is communicated and presented. As is it blindsides new players unless they've researched it or have a friend telling them. It's not painfully expensive, but it feels nickle-and-dimey. It should definitely be an add-on option during purchase of an expansion."

BadDragon,ezueqah,t1_ezueaav,1568150748.0,"No problem! 

Customs duties are a tax collected by the local government of the country you're shipping to. Basically they charge a % of the value of the product to the person receiving it. 

For example, using fake numbers I just made up, let's say you're shipping something worth 100 bucks, and the country you're shipping to wants 10% in duties. When the package arrived, they'd hold it at the post and the receiver would need to come in and pay the 10 dollars to receive the package. 

It's basically the government recovering the taxes they would've received had the product not come from out of the country, if that makes sense. Not every country charges this and it would all depend on where it's ultimately going.

Hope this helps!"
BadDragon,ezue5dr,t3_d2elvz,1568150416.0,"Assuming you're shipping from the US to another country, USPS is generally your most affordable option. They have rates you can look up on their website, but it depends on the final weight and dimensions of your box (dim weight hurrrts.) 

Things to keep in mind is you have to declare what the product is (I recommend silicone sculpture) and how much it's worth in USD. The person on the other end might be responsible for customs duties depending on the country you're shipping to. You can sometimes consider the package a gift of no value, however this can prevent you from recovering any money in a claim if something goes wrong (and is sometimes illegal if it isn't actually a gift of no value.) 

Make sure you package your stuff safely and tightly so that it survives the rough handling it's sure to be subjected to."

Guildwars2,ez2c7ee,t1_ez2b9ie,1567654310.0,Gotcha. Normally it would be a situation that you could reinstall/update your graphics drivers to see if that solves it. I'm not familiar with Mac troubleshooting steps lol. Maybe do a fresh install of the game? Something could've went funny
Guildwars2,ez20tnp,t3_czustc,1567651902.0,I wish I knew more about Macs but... Do they have something similar to drivers? Like does Intel have a software you could update for the graphics potentially? I'm sorry I don't know much about anything outside of Windows haha

BorderlinePDisorder,eyy3del,t3_czflff,1567570057.0,"I ended up thinking I was obsessive-compulsive when I first started to notice my mental health really taking its toll on my day to day. My health insurance at the time required referrals to go to a psychiatrist, so I ended up going to my general practitioner and explained what it was that I was feeling and he ended up sending me to a specialist. They diagnosed me with BPD after a couple sessions, though I came into it expecting an OCD diagnosis. While looking into illnesses yourself can maybe give you can idea of what you might have, it's always best to get a real doctor to look at your unique case and go from there, so long as you can afford it. 

The hardest part is really getting up and just going to talk to your doctor about it and getting the help that you need. It can be hard to open up.

My insurance at the time was decent in that it covered 3 visits a month with a 40 dollar copay, however my doctor initially wanted me weekly so I had to eat the last visit a month out-of-pocket. It can be expensive but I feel like it was worth it overall. However if you're living cheque to cheque it's worth seeking assistance in paying if you can. Therapy can add up very very quickly (assuming you are in the US.)"
Guildwars2,eyqanyo,t3_cxmgnl,1567334552.0,"Right, you aren't wrong, but Anet is comprised of human beings. The human beings that see the vitriol being directed at them are the ones I believe he was trying to evoke compassion with. It's easy to feel like you're ""sticking it to the man"" when you're being toxic to a business but it's important to remember that oftentimes the person that has to see that isn't the one who made the decisions you're pissed about.
