I mourn all of those things, and I mourn the hope that I had for his future.

We knew early on that something wasn't right and he was under the care of a psychiatrist from the age of four. We struggled with him constantly. He started getting in trouble at about 12. It would have been with the law, but he was very good looking and knew how to charm his way out it. Eventually he did get into enough trouble to get sent to a boys ranch. He did well there, came home and started refusing his meds, instead doing meth and Xanax. By the time we knew, he was 18 so we couldn't force him to go to rehab. Just before he turned 20 he got into an argument with his dad and then took his own life. It destroyed me and and in a lot of ways the rest of the family, too.
I guess I just want to remind parents who go through similar things that it's worth it to keep trying. I made so many mistakes with him, looking back. I don't ever want any parent to know how I feel. Just try to hug them and remember how much you love them. Also, try to take breaks, even though I know how impossible that can be, and take care of yourselves!"
