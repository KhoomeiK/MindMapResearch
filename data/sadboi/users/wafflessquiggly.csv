dbtselfhelp,f9jpn0o,t3_e5hdzg,1575382468.0,"I'm really sorry. I know it sucks so much when you do all you can to support someone and they leave anyway. Especially when you need them the most. I hated my ex so much, I helped him graduate by working my ass off so he could go to school, was loving and kind, all that mess just for him to abandon me right before it was MY turn to go to school and get financial help back. He also started dating someone else within the WEEK of me moving out. 

I hated him. So much. I hated myself and I hated him, I wanted to kill him and I wanted to be in his arms and so I hated him more. It was a horrible time and I completely understand. 

What did help me a lot was meditation. Like a lot a lot. Just five mins every day even to sit and focus on breathing to help regulate your emotions. It makes such a big difference, you don't even realize. I also read a lot. I had to distract myself every second of every day until one day it didn't hurt like that anymore. Be with friends. Listen to music, smoke some ganja(if you're into that kinda thing), take up a random art project like scrapbooking or painting or whatever. Things that will take up your time and help you see your happiness is what ultimately matters and means the most. 

Hang in there! I promise it gets better. I promise."

BPD,f5aeoer,t1_f5adspf,1572106001.0,"Hopefully the symptoms get better with the Wellbutrin, and I'll give it a little longer just in case it does end up making me feel better instead of worse eventually. I've heard SSRIs are good for accompanying Lamictal, so good luck with that!

Around 75mg I'd started to notice a calmness I just felt all the time. Like the absence of anxiety, just being able to do normal things without feeling dread or sick or heavy. Eating, interacting with people and doing things didn't make me as anxious or nervous anymore at least not in the sickening intense way. I was also a lot less sensitive to triggers and things that would normally flare up some BPD insecurity or anger symptom. For example, I always hated when my boyfriend would walk away from me at the store or gas station to find his own stuff and I'd freak out at him for leaving me. That kind of stuff just stopped bothering me, I wasn't irritated and yelling about irrational things because even if I did feel bothered by it, I had like a barrier between the incident and my reaction now to stop me from acting out inappropriately. I don't even know what it exactly does, but it has really leveled out my extreme episodes, raging, frustrations and anxiety. I really hope it will do the same for you. I am now on the maxed out 200mg dose. ALSO, I lost weight on it which I have no complaints about."

I think it's very likely you'll like Lamictal after a few weeks, it's honestly magical (for me at least).

AskNPD,ey6hvt4,t1_ey6f49m,1566855979.0,"He made me happy for a long time. And then I don't know, the bad started outweighing the good. He still does make me happy, but I can't communicate any of my feelings about something he does that's not quite healthy or fair to me. Things are always fine until he's being held accountable. I have a tendency to feel used even when I'm not being taken advantage of just because of experience, but he has definitely helped me through life on many occasions and selflessly. 

So I don't know. I get someone I feel does actually give a shit about my well-being out of this relationship. I get happy fun laughs and adventures because we click well. But I also get invalidation, splitting, sarcastic side comments that are actually belittling, no emotional support when I'm having breakdowns over things he's done to hurt me, inconsistency and lack of commitment because of him splitting or whatever the hell happens to him because I will never understand how he goes from wanting to be with me and saying he doesn't have energy for a relationship within the hour. 

I haven't talked to him for two days. I know it doesn't sound like much but it's a big deal for me. He hasn't reached out. I was having a panic attack over the phone and he hung up and switched his phone off. He texted me the next day saying he hoped I was okay. I haven't responded to him since. It hurt and it sucked to be left like that, all over him blaming me for something and me telling him he had a part in it too. But it's never his fault, it's never him, and if it ever is him, it's because I drove him to it. 
I'm just going to maintain no contact. I think you're right, maybe losing me for good will wake him up a little, but that's the best I can hope for. I just can't get through to him about his issues. He just doesn't accept it, he thinks it's funny I think everyone has a mental illness and that I'm ridiculous for going around 'diagnosing' people.

I get off to connection and need to be looked at with desire and love or I feel like shit. Sometimes I'll get really in the moment and am generally really good in bed, just when I'm in a long term relationship and invested in someone loving me, I really really need sex to be something different than just getting someone off. I've been struggling with this so much lately after finding out my partner pictures me in different scenarios when we have sex. Not pictures someone else, just doing me in fantasy scenarios. The fact that it's about the act and not about me makes me want to rip my skin off. 

I was also molested as a child and sexually assaulted once in my teens. I can't stand feeling like this about something I should just be able to enjoy and love myself through."

He has gone above and beyond for me so many times and this may be because of myself feeling unworthy of love, I will try to dig around trying to find reasons other than genuine concern that he did those things for me. 

There are definitely times it's been for self-gain and those were more apparent times, and he has hurt me greatly when it came to choosing his own needs over something that completely destroyed me, but I don't think that diminishes everything sincere that he does feel for me.

I consider myself to be extremely empathetic, unless I'm in an episode. My episodes can be raging, splitting on myself/someone else and the worst; physical harm. When my emotions and pain are to an extent of me losing control is when I am completely void of feeling, understanding or caring of what's going on around me including the distress I'm causing someone else. 

In his case, it's hard for me to ever know when something is up, his behavior is never external blow ups like mine is. It's hard to explain, but his toxicity is only apparent in his coldness or lack of understanding to why something he does is causing me pain and why that isn't okay. The hardest thing to deal with for me, is his inability to recognize what he's doing is hurtful and not just turn it around on me just being unhappy and miserable all the time. I just can't get through to him and it constantly just makes me feel devalued and like anything that affects me doesn't matter, will not matter because he's more concerned about his own peace and needs.

AskNPD,erh81bu,t1_ergtnbo,1560869421.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. I think the fact that I am borderline makes that idealization disappear fairly easily, I'm definitely not the perfect partner either given all my insecurities, lack of trust etc. 

I jus recently started researching NPD and I'm honestly so fascinated by how close it can be to BPD (although not the same obviously), and reading about splitting made me feel kind of better as bad as that sounds. Just because now I can understand and i know what is happening when he is not being the sweet, loving partner that I know. 

Currently I'm trying no contact. The last time we spoke I was sobbing on a bathroom floor begging him to tell me he still loved me which I don't know why I still do since I know it makes him SO cold and just mean.. it's like the more I cry and beg the more repulsed he gets and says everything he possibly can that will hurt me even more to my core. Anyway that was the last time I spoke to him and he'd said ""I don't ever want to be with you again, I don't miss the relationship, I don't have romantic feelings for you, I want to be a good person in your life but I'm never dating you again."" 
I've heard those lines so often, so many times every time he decides he's over it and wants to break up, then comes back like nothing happened or that we were just in a bad place and it'll be okay now, just for it to happen again. Now I'm done. I feel so broken from 4 years of this, but I do love him. I just can't keep letting him do this to me, it fucks so hard with me. I'm already broken I can't handle the love of my life making it that much worse. :( I don't know if no contact is a good or bad thing, I just want to try and protect my feelings for once instead of being too afraid to lose him."
AskNPD,erfbbll,t1_erf5ss1,1560804336.0,"I never said I really changed at all, I only said I was better at controlling majority of my symptoms. 
I have taken full accountability for my toxicity, and still continue to. I put in a lot of work and the reason I am so ""exceptionally compliant"" with therapy is because of my will to be better, every day, and my progress has nothing to do with the severity of my BPD either. I just work on it every single day and it's still miserable, but I keep up with it constantly. 

I was triggered a lot. My rages when turned abusive were never justifiable and I had no concept of stabilizing my emotions especially when they were being attacked in every awful way I've ever been afraid of. Threatened with break ups (abandonment) every day over the slightest inconveniences to him, bringing up my abusive family to use them against me, or tell me I'm like them, trying to hurt me deliberately by bringing up my dad molesting me as a way to make ME feel bad for not forgiving him, etc. triggered me so so badly especially before the medication. The way he would make me feel led up to many suicide attempts, he never knew when to stop provoking me. It was relentless, and I will not keep making excuses for him in that regard anymore. I take full responsibility for my illness and abusive behaviors, and I'm extremely grateful I've managed to regulate emotions before I erupt into rage when I'm being hurt, but he was very much at fault for how he treated me before I ""went batshit crazy"".

I completely empathize and maybe too much, but you are right. I am entitled to protect myself and my happiness. 

I think, like you, whenever I've walked away and 'left' him is when he usually drifts towards recognizing how he can be. Things are always just so in between hopeful and doomed constantly and in my head we love each other so much that we never actually give up, we distance ourselves until we reset, then we try again. More hopeful than last time, just for it to crash again. Over and over.

I wish I could tell you it is okay and much much better to be away from someone that causes you so much distress, but I know you won't believe it from me, not until you know it for yourself. At some point you have to ask yourself if it's worth feeling so awful over all the time. Nothing, nothing nothing nothing is worth your happiness, your peace of mind, your well being. I promise you love, he isn't worth you feeling so miserable over. You deserve better. 

To be quite honest, just the fact that you are so afraid of him leaving you is most likely why he keeps threatening it. He knows it will make you spiral and apologize profusely and that's what he wants. He is just being an asshole."
BPD,eq4see6,t1_eq4rjf0,1559784637.0,"It's different when he's threatening you or if he's genuinely upset and wants to escape an abusive situation. If he knows he's just playing games, it is actually manipulation and won't make your symptoms any better. 
Your emotions are still valid, even if they are intense, and if he's not even willing to communicate to try and make situations like that better, he isn't concerned about putting in effort, only about seeing you suffer every time he threatens you. That isn't fair to you, and you deserve better than someone that is okay with watching your symptoms escalate because of something they don't even want to work on."
BPD,eq4pult,t3_bxa2f9,1559782645.0,"My boyfriend did this a lot. I used to think it was cruel and manipulative, especially when he said it was because I got out of hand and it made him retaliate in response by wanting to leave me. It was usually after things calmed down and I was able to apologise for being irrational, OR we could have a healthy conversation about what triggered me and what could change, that the urge to break up would diffuse. 

I have horrible abandonment issues as well. Every time I had an episode (and keep in mind, I was abusive as hell, screaming in his face, hitting, threatening suicide etc.) He had every right to want to get away from me and try to leave me. It made me a lot worse, for sure. Just like you, I had times I had to gather myself at work or I would've walked out and the panic that set in was insanely painful, I would blow up his phone and call to scream and cry and it made everything much much worse. 

After therapy I was able to get my emotions and the way I reacted under control. I was still triggered, but I didn't scream or hit or call him names. I would walk away from the situation. I also learned that even if he did break up with me just to change his mind later, it is normal for someone to feel so distraught with being attacked and hated on that they want to leave the relationship. It is normal for someone that is dedicated and in love to want to keep trying when things seem like they can be or will be better. He is not trying to harm you as much as he is trying to protect himself, and we can't always expect people we love to cope perfectly with how we can be. 

I had to start calming myself down when I would start spiraling from the fear of him leaving me. I'd tell myself, if I can get a grip and breathe, do some grounding techniques, focus on my surroundings, instead of the fear of him leaving me I can make this situation a LOT less painful for myself as well as for him. Which is all he needed sometimes, for me to just calm down enough for him to not feel so anxious from how I was acting. 

Just remind yourself you are in control of the situation, even when he is trying to leave you, tell yourself you are okay, it may seem and feel like your whole world is crashing down, but you are in control. Everything is okay, you are okay, he is okay, and sometimes all you need is to just bring yourself to a point of peace. More for your sake than his. It's a horrible miserable feeling when you're being left and I understand it completely. I also understand how much better I feel when I'm able to separate my emotions from reality of the situation, rationalizing and validating myself instead of needing it from the person that's causing the distress in the first place. 

I hope this is good advice, I honestly don't know if it is, but I've been there and it worked for me. With therapy it has been a lot easier to identify irrational thoughts and fears, and how to cope with them to feel the least amount of distress as possible. Wishing you the best."

BPD,epjgips,t3_buybl3,1559253608.0,"24 y/o. I have suicidal thoughts often, but they are extremely heightened just a week before I get my period. It wasn't until recently that I realized how bad my depression gets and is linked to PMS. I feel more hopeless and unable to pull myself out of falling down an extremely deep dark hole, even if I've been doing better relatively. I become angry, feel like everyone is doing something wrong just to hurt me, pretty much everything that makes me BPD is way more amplified. By far though the most prominent aspect is the major depression. I can't even explain just how sad and low I get. I feel completely hopeless and broken and unable to see any way out. Uncontrollable sobbing when I'm not having a full breakdown with ugly crying over feeling worthless and life feeling pointless. It's miserable. Like I said, I always thought it was one of my low phases but it is always just a week before my period and it's easy to tell because of the pre-cramps what is about to happen. 
Unfortunately even knowing what is going on doesn't change how awful I end up feeling every time."

BPD,epj3ahx,t1_epiw1jh,1559246503.0,"He never acted out when I was moody or had bad days..in fact he would always ask if there was anything he could do to get me out of it. It was always just when he did something that I wasn't okay with (liking crude pictures of girls on social media) or not prioritizing me over his friends just minor stuff that makes me feel like I was just unrealistically demanding, that's when he would become cold and 'tired of it' and I make him so unhappy. The more he withdrew and I became more insecure I wasn't the girl he was happy with, the worse my episodes got and the worse he was at dealing with them. I had bruises too many times from physical altercations and it just wasn't right for so long. 

Maybe it is just all me. I just wreck everything good around me. I turned a patient sweet supportive human into a cold withdrawn shell."
BPD,epijeov,t1_epii1zw,1559239928.0,"No, I get that completely. I always wish I had it in me to not be overly accommodating, wanting the best for someone even when they've destroyed me to the point of going out of my way for them when they really don't deserve my effort. I'm having trouble concluding whether my ex is a narcissist. He seems to fit some symptoms but he also doesn't fit many others, and his cold, selfish behavior was always triggered by my irrational responses or anxiety to things. Thus why I said I hated how bad he was at handling everything. 

Just know you are a wonderful person, and even though you're feeling used because of your heart just being unable to walk away or having so so much love to give, try and remember you are a more compassionate person than most, and your goodness makes you whole, not lesser. How people respond to how much you give, care and love isn't reflective of what you deserve. I'm sorry that makes us so prone to being mistreated. It's painful."
BPD,epifhx9,t1_epibdhr,1559238476.0,"I can't imagine having a child mixed into something like this. It is so hard, without that being an aspect. 
The part where they don't want to hear a thing about what could be fixed or done right unless it's you just apologizing profusely drives me fucking crazy. Like I don't have a voice, my feelings dont matter, I'm only here for you and your needs. You don't care about how any of this affects me. I'm sorry you are going through it. I understand how rough it is."
BPD,epi7dmf,t1_epi6buk,1559235479.0,"The last thing he said to me was ""Nothing will ever change between us until you can change who you are."" And I told him everyone could change something about themselves. Like you said, I am troubled, but there's no way everything that sucks is based off my BPD. He is wonderful in many ways but would I ever be able to make him see he can't just blame me for everything? 

I keep worrying about him moving on. Already talking to someone else or dating someone he ends up falling in love with, sharing the things we did, just can't handle the idea of him being with someone else and I just need to stop caring about that. I need to not give a fuck because that kind of anxiety is just counter productive and I don't want something like my ex moving on taking over my life. :/"
BPD,ep6usic,t3_bu3n0o,1559073814.0,"The self-destruction. Insane amounts of self hate just consuming me, making me project, need constant validation and love because no matter how hard I try I can't seem to pull an ounce of self worth out of me. I would do anything to even remotely be able to accept or like myself. 
Being so unhappy with every single thing about myself ruins everything else around me. I'm a burden until I can learn to validate and love myself."

BPD,ep06l9u,t3_btn05j,1558971302.0,"Do not settle, just because you've already started forming feelings. He wont change his stance, he wouldn't have said what he did if that's not what he wanted. We can't control how other people feel or what they do unfortunately, but we can control how we respond to it so we can save ourselves from unnecessary agony. It's not worth it! You will find something better, or at the very worst, you won't be with someone that makes you anxious/miserable/insecure."
