Up to the artists to take it from there. I’m not artistically talented. Just up at 3am trying to distract from my problems."
depression,ffso9pv,t3_clue8y,1580186928.0,I’ve come to terms with it. Both the fact that I will most likely die of suicide and death in general. Problem is my brain knows this is wrong and sends off alarms that something’s not right. Though they have just become static and background noise. And it’s getting to the point where I’ve realized I’m in a trap. Like when someone wakes up from a loop and realizes it. But I can’t escape. And the realization has made the idea of suicide much more appealing every new loop.

GameTheorists,f8ro2s4,t3_e1jp4r,1574746301.0,"It’s interesting to note that at times you will hear heavy breathing like someone is severely sick or close to death. It’s also interesting to note that the times you collect remnant are surrounded by a purple dark cloud. And if you walk into it, it surrounds your screen, then an animatronic appears. Could it be William trying to lure you in with remnant, trying to enter you or your phone and infuse itself with your phone, or you, and the animatronics are lured toward it. Mistaking you as William and killing you. I’ve also heard the line “you weren’t expecting me now weren’t you?” As if he’s talking to someone specifically. Like this was planned. Idk it’s too buggy for me to continue at this moment.

Edit: I replayed and when you’re collecting remnant, you can hear voices of what sounds like children whispering from far away “you’re smart, pick one.” William maybe convincing vanny to choose a target?"

It also doesn’t look like he’s going to veer from it. Not being entitled, as long as hes happy. It’s obviously working for him. But as such, I have no idea who Jorgen, sven, or the sheep is.
