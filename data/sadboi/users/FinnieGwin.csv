You’ll do better focusing on yourself without someone blaming your faults on your mental illness. Find a supportive partner that’s willing to fight with you instead of shaming you for a disorder. Don’t settle for someone who doesn’t help you through the worst. 

I know you feel terrible now, but it’s because breakups suck. They just do. You’ll feel better tomorrow and then better the next day. Keep on worrying about yourself.

It’s been a very positive experience for me so I’m sad that you’re having issues. I do hope you see some improvement.

Sometimes I get so isolated with my diagnosis that being around others who live with this just like I do makes me realize that I’m not as alone as I thought. 

Group is hard. Therapy is hard. Working on yourself and getting better isn’t supposed to be easy for us, but push through those fears and see what this kind of therapy can do for you. I found I shared a lot my first day. People listened to me & I felt heard. Other new people just watched and observed and they seemed happy to be there too. New people come every week. No politics.

I could sit here and list off advice for you to follow, but I can hear how badly your struggling right now and it's not fair for me to feed you bullshit.

bipolar,eykv9w7,t1_eykgqha,1567169124.0,Ughhhh... I hate thinking about my psychosis. I think I have some PTSD from it because it was so bad. I would hate reliving a part of my life I’m working so hard to move past. I’d feel pretty shitty if loved ones recorded such a stressful event.

BipolarReddit,eycbzbw,t1_eyc0v4b,1566999666.0,This is one of the best answers here. Please go talk to your doctor & see about getting those meds adjusted. Make sure you’re seeing a therapist regularly. It’s time for a tune up. You deserve better than this. Life can be better than this.
BipolarReddit,eyahek3,t3_cwag0y,1566963411.0,"You injured yourself and had life events that would make ANYONE upset/depressed. You did the best you could do with the tools you had. It’s easy for us to hold onto that blame more than others, but please remember to go easy on yourself. Don’t think about what you could’ve or should be doing. Just do what you WANT to do. If dealing with the pressure of a training session is too much than don’t feel bad about cancelling. You’re still exercising. You’re working your way back to health. You’re doing a good job! Keep it up!"
BipolarReddit,ey8uwdn,t1_ey8oohj,1566928860.0,"Yikes -- Trazadone is what was suggested for me (if i start to have sleeping issues). I am due to increase my Vraylar dose to 3mg this Friday. We'll see if I have sleep issues then. 

So sorry you're struggling. Hopefully it's been a good medication for you otherwise."
BipolarReddit,ey8jp8j,t3_cw20su,1566921628.0,I was told it can cause sleep issues. My doc is having me take it in the morning and told me to call her if I have trouble falling asleep. She said she’s prescribe me a non-habit forming sleep aid. It might be worth calling your doctor about.
bipolar,ey77cdm,t3_cvqrr1,1566873852.0,"Must have been a hard decision, but you made the right call. I’m glad you’re safe & I hope you get some much needed rest and care. We’re here thinking of you."
BipolarReddit,ey4bq44,t3_cvhqxk,1566787344.0,"Me. I was diagnosed PTSD (which I still believe I have) and was prescribed Effexor to boost my depressive mood. After, I became a HUGE pothead. I smoked constantly. Blew tons of money on bongs & weed. I spent money on a new PC instead of paying off my medical bills. I ate nothing but take out. 

And as soon as my partner left for a trip & I couldn’t talk to him, I went into psychosis. I should’ve been hospitalized, but had the sense to call my doctor and she got me in immediately and put me on Risperdal. I very quickly came off the Effexor (and had ever side effect known to man...) 

Honestly, it makes me doubt my bipolar. Like, did a medication cause me to act out? Plus me being stoned out of my brain (although I didn’t smoke much that day). 

I hate that a drug fueled something so awful in me. I hate that I had no control. I hate the fear that it could happen again. I hate feeling non-functioning all of a sudden because of what happened. It feels so unfair. I got slapped with this label and now I’m just fucked with more drugs that make me feel like shit. 

Ugh. Sorry for the rant. But this is something I think about a lot. I’m slowly working through it in therapy, but I can’t move past it. I don’t like believing I’m sick. I’m tired of being sick.

Edit: I don’t smoke pot anymore & haven’t since I went crazy-pants. I get urges to misbehave but I don’t. I honestly have a hard time hearing people self-medicate with weed because I sometimes want to smoke again... I’ve already been drug tested once."
bipolar,ey3eew6,t1_ey326il,1566762336.0,"Shadowkeep is coming up and it looks to be an amazing expansion... I'm super hyped about it. It's funny, because I don't USUALLY have social anxiety, but lately, I find I can't stay out in public for very long. 

Destiny and my clan is my ""social outing"" I need without feeling too depressed. These people don't expect me to behave a certain way, put on a happy face, or care if I am having an off day. And most of them I've only met within the last couple months. Speaking as a female gamer playing with all men, I gotta say, it's rather refreshing. 

Not to mention, D2 is a nice way to play with friends or solo when you want. But it does help having a core group that *really* understands what you're dealing with day to day. Thankfully, two of my clanmates get it."
