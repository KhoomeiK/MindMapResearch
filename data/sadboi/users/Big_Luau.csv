Shit is maximum cringe, boog or no boog I would be legit embarrassed to fight alongside somebody or worse get killed alongside someone with zero social skills and a fleshlight collection. Like, we're not friends."

You might fuck a few up but they'll kill you long before you get all of them. Maybe with a lethal dose of meth? I dunno."

I bet they died terrified, pissing themselves knowing that real men with real training are coming in there with no objective over than to kill you by any means necessary. I just hope they took a few to the body and died in agony rather than instant headshots."

Nothing short of an employee buying a bunch of propane tanks and a lighter on camera at a gas station an hour prior or a written confession is going to get anyone convicted, and in all likelihood they died in the explosion anyway, and again trying to find out who is next to impossible, and even then they're already dead. 

A mystery? Sure. 

A high priority? No."

They can simply look up your goyim card and if you ever commit any wrong think they can just freeze it 'pending review' (kike approval ) and you'll be fucked. But enjoy daddy Israel's debit card big boy, let them sell your data, leak your info and then demand your tax money from the government to cover it up that you'll pay back through more taxes, you're getting robbed so many different ways it's a wonder you even have a pair of shoes to walk to the ATM with you subservient fuck.

But liberals will NEVER imply that Mexico isn't anything other than a down on its luck country, not the violent war torn shithole it is complete with dismembered corpses and bodies hanging from bridges by the dozen. Doing that would wake up far too many people who would then question why in the ever living fuck we wouldn't want a bigass wall and round the clock deportation. Liberals are terrified a third of their voting demographic might not be seen as good little pious Christians looking for a better life, if the American public knew the reality of MS-13, cartel torture, the fact they use helicopter mounted mini guns to fight these groups that can outgun federal military forces, they would turn on the liberal media faster than a pit bull with rabies."
