hungarian,fqz42x9,t3_glmect,1589759552.0,"Hm, if your mother is hungarian that’s all that should matter. But I’ve heard that they are notorious for wanting a paper trail, especially for marriages. Also, do you have your fathers birth certificate? If your mother is the only hungarian one that’s probably all they want on his side. I’ve heard every consulate is different but I’ve never heard of them conducting an interview with more than just yourself. I’m curious, did they specify why they’re doing that procedure? The only reason I could think of is if you’re not a legal adult."
Anxiety,fqcb1n9,t3_gh7hu3,1589253958.0,I went off of Zoloft and my biggest symptom was the dizziness. It was so intense I almost totally blacked out a few times. The withdrawal side effects lasted about a week or two and then I was fine.
Anxiety,fptur2d,t1_fpswqg0,1588898665.0,"For me eating gives this temporary dopamine release and feeling of comfort, which is something my body is always seeking when I’m stressed. The feeling is very short lived though, which makes it a vicious cycle. I’m on the opposite end where I don’t understand how people don’t reach for food, it’s my brains first response even when internally I’m shouting “no!! stop eating this isn’t a good idea!” It’s only when I’m experiencing extreme instances of loss that I lose my appetite like that."

Anxiety,fpetbv1,t3_fnz5n3,1588554492.0,"Bit of a vent: This morning my 11 year old family cat passed away from cancer. We brought her to the emergency vet and only I was allowed to go inside. I’m grateful that I was the one to be there for her in her final moments but I know my mom wanted to be there too. I’m in agony and feeling so alone without her here, she was my heart. It was so traumatic to see her deteriorate over the course of a month. We didn’t know it was cancer until less than 24 hours before she passed, and it wasn’t until the end of March that she was noticeably ill. I’d never wish that experience on anybody. On top of all that, I can’t see my boyfriend until international travel opens up again and it’s been so hard to not be able to comfort each other in person. My family really needs him around more than ever. The news that the plane tickets were canceled devastated my mother last month and now this.. I feel very hopeless in the thick of it all, I hope we can all be together again in July like we originally planned."
witchcraft,fp6qr09,t1_fp6gxuq,1588356962.0,"Then you’re still wrong. Real witchcraft after hostile Christian takeover still included the pagan deities. I urge you to research orthodox Christianity and the hostile takeover of Baltic and Slavic states. Many pagans worshiped their deities under the guise of the saints the church based them off of so as to avoid persecution. In some areas, such as rural Russia, this conversion never fully succeeded and witchcraft and paganism still is practiced there to this day."
Anxiety,foqize6,t1_foqe362,1587994645.0,"I'm with you, and I feel even more isolated because so few people also seem to feel this way. Just looking at this thread with all these people loving the lockdown makes my heart race. :/"
europe,fo6tm4t,t1_fo696up,1587566492.0,"That's simply not true, Americans also use it as an open invitation. Many people that you're simply acquaintances with will open up to you about their day. But we also use it as a greeting in a supermarket setting with people you don't know. It's all based on level of familiarity. If you don't know someone you're not going to start gushing all of your personal information. ""Hey how are ya?"" still expects an answer even if it's brief. If you're seeing someone multiple times somewhere that you frequent it's also expected that you acknowledge them like that even in passing. To ignore someone you regularly see would be considered rude here. It's a foreign concept to some people but in the american midwest people will often form acquaintance level bonds with people that work in grocery stores they frequent or people they regularly see in parks, etc."
StartledCats,fo1kg4f,t1_fo0zfv6,1587435240.0,"Hm, if they’re puking from wet food there might be an ingredient or specific type of meat they’re allergic to in there. Dry food isn’t particularly good for cats. It can contain too much fiber, usually has more unnecessary additives that provide no nutritional value for cats, and doesn’t have the water content necessary for a cats diet. If it’s cheap wet food though it is just as stuffed full of fillers and not great for the cats. 

For the OP, I noticed you said they’re often puking up some food and it’s not just a hair ball, maybe bring up allergies as a possibility. My own cat can’t eat beef and tuna :/ poor thing usually barfs it up or gets seriously stinky poops"

Humidity helps your sinuses drain and your throat to stay moist. Another thing that helps me a bit is holding my face above hot water to drain sinuses. Two in one when I hold it above tea I’m brewing for my throat lol"
