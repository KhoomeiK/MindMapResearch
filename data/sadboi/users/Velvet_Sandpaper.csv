BipolarSOs,fpgjszp,t3_gci9lm,1588604103.0,"These rules completely resonate with me and are ones that are the responsibility of the person with BPD, imo. 

For my own benefit I have done my best to summarize u/rextreme's rules to list the what and not include the why. I hope others find this useful. 

The Five Rules

1. Never quit or skip meds
2. Get a good night's sleep
3. Maintain a healthy diet.  Avoid junk foods, go light on carbs, and drink coffee in moderation. Eat fruit for sugar. 
4. No drugs or alcohol
5. Exercise daily

My thanks to u/rextreme"

BipolarSOs,fpdmjlt,t1_fpbt5px,1588529941.0,Is he on meds?  Some seriously increase hunger.  Olanzapine is killing me in that regard.

bipolarart,fnt61ax,t3_g3sifg,1587235295.0,"I use my photographs as wallpaper and put all my shortcuts into folders.  This gives me quick access to images to space out to if/when my thoughts spiral.  Maybe this tactic will work for folks who also use art as a coping mechanism.

FYI, the image I use here is a mosiac created from one photograph."
bipolarart,fmu1npj,t3_fxfp3u,1586382908.0,"This is a single, unmanipulated shot (except normal tweaks, like exposure and contrast) .  I figured this technique out (like my other pics I have posted to this sub) during a prolonged period of hypomania.  Silver lining, I suppose.  ðŸ™‚

FYI---I use Adobe Lightroom, which is like a digital darkroom."

bipolarart,fmp43xg,t3_fwllq1,1586274068.0,"The base of this is a photograph.  The others I have posted have been ""as-is"", while I used Photoshop on this one to create a kaleidoscope effect. 

I started doing these about a year and half before I was diagnosed with Bipolar II.  I had originally been diagnosed with Depression by my General Practitioner and put on an antidepressant which made things worse----the lows went away, but the trade-off was being pretty much locked into hypomania for a bit over four years.  I was not a nice person.  Hindsight may be 20/20, but it can also be a beast.

I find these pictures soothing when I just stare at them. They make great wallpaper.  I have this one as my mobile phone wallpaper and have all my apps in folders at the bottom of my screen so I have an unobstructed view of the pictures.  This lets me space out on it whenever.  Feel free to use this as wallpaper."

bipolar2,fk7ewym,t1_fk5gmil,1583934988.0,"""AlthoughÂ drinking alcoholÂ theÂ morningÂ after a heavyÂ drinkingÂ session may help to alleviate the symptoms of a hangover it is not recommended. It only puts off the symptoms and it can too easily become a habit. If the individual has things to do that day then even a small amount ofÂ alcoholÂ could affect their performance.""

bipolar2,fk5evq2,t1_fk4d55o,1583879082.0,"Drinking in the morning, unless you work a late shift, is a clear sign of a problem.  To loosely quote W.C. Fields:  ""The hardest part about quitting drinking is not drinking.""

If you can avoid picking up a drink for one day, you xan do two.  If you can do two, you can do week, and so on.

I can only speak from experience, but I drank similarly to you and just made sure I never picked up that ""first"" drink.  I haven't picked up that drink for 15 years in April."
bipolar2,fk2o1ov,t1_fk2j9aa,1583805251.0,What do you drink now and how often?
