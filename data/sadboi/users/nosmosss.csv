Having said that - the mortal body decays and moves toward that which comprised it (the earth) and the soul moves to that which it has affinity with. 

Life is but a cog on the wheel '- a dream state, and its purpose is to serve your soul through varying experiences, both ""good"" and ""bad"". Its the hard times that strengthen you  - not the good. Were all times easy we would never appreciate it, having not point of reference. 

Reincarnation is a reality - but its foolish to dwell on things we can't possibly know in this life. This is a path to unhappiness as you are constantly caught up in your thoughts (worries) about what may be or what happened in the past.

The earth periodically goes through cataclysmic changes due to the passage of a large red comet / planet. As the body locks on to earth, the mid Atlantic ridge locks on to the giant magnet and rips  causing the crust to shift. The oceans - remaining separate from the crust travel and slosh inland for miles. 

During rotation stoppage the buldge of the earth flattens , sending water to the poles, carrying rhinos to England and elephants to Alaska. 

Volcanos, dormant and active erupt. Dust falling from the object ignites over super heated volcanos, raining down fire in places. In others the carbon turns to petrocarbon and rains black rain - oil, which seeps into the ground forming pools. 

Animals and humans are covered in sediment, fossils are formed. Forests are torn away and burnt, then buried, forming coal beds. 

Civilizations, especially those along coastlines are cast to ruins. The civilized world is thrust back into the stone age. 

Mountains are formed and land sinks. 

As the old poles, having been dragged to warmer climates melt, sea levels rise. Over the years new poles are formed and the sea level drops and stabilizes. 

The length of the years change and the position of the sun. Years pass before record keeping occurs again. 

These traumatic events are handed down through myth and legend, eventually personified as ancient dieties. 

Those in the know - the high priests , understand the stories are real. This knowledge is handed down through the esoteric traditions. 

----

Global warming, climate change, is primarily due to the arrival of this body. 

Mass bird deaths, fish and other aquatic life - due to crust under the ocean stretching. Methane being the culprit. 

Globally people hear roaring sounds in the skies - the crust along fault lines churning and cracking. 

UFOs become more predominant as the awakening process is quickened - mankind is being told subliminal messages about the impending shift and to prepare. 

Those in power who know want the populace to be unaware - as they fear the fallout of a society awakening to th realization that nothing matters but family, love  friends and a return to nature and knowing its ways.

The pole shift is the ultimate conspiracy. From a historical perspective (geology and comparative mythology) there's not much to debate, in my opinion.  The great conspiracies stem from current events - and if true, many global actions and events  can be traced back to this.

I decided to remove dairy - and what so ya know ? Last few weeks breathing is normal and no Gerd.

5. Get some digestive pills and use those with meals.

Prion  disease (infectious protein) has a long history , and one that's tied to the ongoing cannibalism of brain matter. Meaning animals eating the brains of the same animal. 

Factory farmed cows were fed a diet of left over COW - including the brain, which led to B.S.E - Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (mad cow). 

A history:

In the mid 20th century there were two separate cases of dementia occurring on differing parts of the world. In papa new Guinea, the natives called it the ""quivering disease"", named after a tree that shook in the wind.
The women and children in the kinship group were coming down with dementia - the men were fine.

As it turns out the area was experiencing major famine and drought. People were dying, and they turned to Cannabilsm. The men got the fatty and meat parts, and the women and children were left with parts like the human brain. 

This was called Kreutzfeld Jacob's disease , named after a couple anthropologists who studied it.

This same phenomenon was  noticed years later on cattle and other wildlife. 

The theory was that, after continuous consumption if Canabilzed brain - an animal eats this, dies, then the same species eats it again, dies etc, would cause misshapen proteins to latch onto the brain  effectively killing the current protein matter. This caused holes in the brain - hence dementia. 

Interestingly patients who die of alzheimers have similar brain pathology. 

In short - your probably ok!

P.s. I have not read up on this stuff in like 14 years so some of the prion stuff may be way more understood than I recall.

""An ultra-glaring Sun was noted in 2003, when Planet X roared into the inner solar system from the direction of Orion, and screeched to a halt as it neared the Sun and the repulsion force clicked in. The tail of Planet X, not affected by the repulsion force, maintained its momentum and wafted past the Sun to deliver red dust and odd atmospheric changes to the Earth. 

In the Summer of 2003, it was noted that people sunburned more readily, construction workers long used to working out of doors, noted an unusual tendency to burn. Crops likewise matured two weeks early that year in many places, and comments about the intense brightness of the Sun were common. What causes the Sun scald, the intense brightness that does not translate into increased heat and cannot be correlated to solar activity or sun spots? A fog bank, with a light shown on it, appears to be evenly lit, because the light is scattered and bouncing back to the observer. Is there more light, or simply scattered light? If the Sun is no longer yellow, it is because all light rays are scattered, and the steady state of yellow is interfered with. 

The perception of increased intensity is due to the mix in light spectrum, those spectrums the eye can best adapt to no longer present. You formerly looked at the setting Sun without distress, the yellow or orange Sun, though the Sun was still in view and its rays were coming into your eye with full force. It is the loss of your yellow Sun that is affecting your eye's ability to look at the Sun, thus the perception of increased brightness, as the Suns rays, scattered, are presenting the same mix to your eye that high noon presents.

 Likewise with the rays that created sunburn, which normally are not bent toward the observer at sunset or at other than high noon, but now are scattered to arrive at one's skin. The time of day is no longer a protection from sunburn. This will only get worse, as the tail continues to turn toward the Earth."""

Jesus was a normal man, in that he ate, shat, had sexual desires (had sex), got angry and sad, laughed and cried. The soul incarnated into the body / man was a very old soul, who was charged to speak spiritual truths in a time of materialistic and spiritual apathy. The same occurred for all the worlds major religious figures, buddha , Mohammad etc. 

It was mankind that turned these spiritual teachings into methods of control. 

The spiritual teachings taught that we are God, god is us. That the soul is infinite , that life is a cog on wheel. That death is birth. That the purpose of life is to awaken your soul - to commune,  to decide your spiritual orientation: service to self or service to other. 

There are many many people on earth today who are incarnated, living normal lives, who are just as spiritually mature as Jesus is / was. This is one of those times - where spiritual leaders incarnate to help mankind but also to warn. 

The teachings relayed in the christian bible are a mixture of earlier, ancient Egyptian,  Celtic,  and pagan belief systems and philosophies. The ancient wisdom traditions very much understood these concepts.

I would highly recommend reading the Kolbrin Manuscripts. It's a rather disparate collection of surviving manuscripts , most of which survived the burning of Glastonbury abby. This was set ablaze by the church because it housed heretical books , from ancient Mesopotamia .

Do other people have their partners with them during lockdown - are they all happy ? Maybe they are - are they not experiencing anxiety over some other reason as well ?

Theres nothing wrong with missing someone's company, but nobody likes to constantly live in their head instead of the moment and experience feelings of anxiety , sadness, fearfulness. 

How do you know your situation would be better ? Maybe you would get on each others nerves and other anxieties would prop up regarding the future of your relationship? Maybe it would be swell   but you'd worry about other stuff (health, family ). 

Point is you dont know, so having anxiety over it is just adding unnecessary worry and stress. Theres nothing wrong with the emotion and thoughts that go into missing someone,  its normal and everybody does it !

Thetruthishere,fmadkwh,t3_ftyoxk,1585890721.0,"When I was around 13, my next door neighbor and best friend at the time would ""sneak out"" during the summer months while the parents slept. We lived in a relatively small town / city, and we felt pretty bad ass running the neighborhood at midnight when we knew we weren't supposed to. 

Usually i would play with toys or read to keep myself awake. This particular night we agreed to meet outside at midnight. 

I sat under my blankets reading after I heard the parents turn the last light off. I lived on the top floor of our old WW2 built home, and knew exactly where to step coming down the stairs so as to avoid the creeking sounds. 

At midnight I crept down, stepping over floor boards and made my way to the front door. I put my shoes on, opened the front door and quietly crept out. 

It was a clear, quiet night in our neighborhood. Three to four of the street lights were on, which was the norm.

I waited on my front deck for my friend. Minutes went by - nothing. His bedroom was on the same floor as mine. Most of the homes on my street looked the same.

Around 30 minutes passed and he still hadn't left his front door. I went down between our homes and started tossing pebbles up to his window

Nothing. 

I went back to my porch and waited another 10 minutes or so. He must have fallen asleep. 

It was at this point that my memories become a bit, fuzzy. Sitting on the deck waiting for Jeff, I next recall seeing a series of multicoloured lights ; yellow, some blue, and I dont remember what else. I remember seeing this above me - then my next memory is waking up the next day in my bed. 

I told my buddy about this , told him I I threw pebbles at his window. He did indeed fall asleep. 

This wasn't a dream , and I was old enough to remember a lot of details. Someday I hope to try regression to see if I can recall details after the lights  :)

My whole life I've been obsessed with UFOs,  ancient cultures , spiritually,  earth crust displacement stuff, etc. I've seen UFOs , only 3 I think. 

I also dont think it was an accident that my neighbor fell asleep that night ðŸ˜‰

spirituality,fm9y0kg,t3_ftynuj,1585879137.0,"We dont really know what the soul is, or rather what the soul is comprised of. What I can say is that the substance which makes up the soul - is a substance , however its most likely vibrating at a higher frequency. It permeates all forms ""matter"" below it. Jainism has a similar belief system. 

The soul gains weight and takes shape , and this depends upon the actions done while incarnated. More than likely , the cripple on earth chose that role to learn something and teach others compassion and hardship, and when the body departs, the soul is a brilliant form of light.

The soul experiences life through our  biology. The nose smells, the tongue tastes, the ears hear - this is chemical, but its the soul that delights in this taste or the sound of music. 

We are all connected in the sense that we are here on earth for one purpose, to learn, to move towards service to self or service to others. To awaken our souls. 

We are also all of the divine. My belief is the stuff of souls was created (on varying levels and vibrations) so that the universe can understand itself. 

Conciousness is self awareness , but this does not mean a soul. Self awarness must exist in a creature for a soul to spark. There must be a sense of presence, of separation,  of hardships , right and wrongs. It's the knowledge that life can be hard that develops the soul - or rather, what we do with that knowledge.  How we approach it.

I think people often confuse spirituality with doing yoga or mushrooms. Spirituality is first and foremost recognizing that you are a soul, and trying to commune with it. Recognizing that life on earth exists because of its trials and tribulations , without it, we would never learn anything.

The purpose of reincarnation is to give the evolving entity (soul) more experience - to develop service to other tendencies. Not sure what purpose reincarnting into the past would serve, as the soul , having lived many lives to begin with (unless you are a newly sparked soul), remembers everything. So if you are an old soul, your soul self remembers all the experiences of every life you've lived.

Incarnating into a  new life means the ""law of forgetfulness "". If we remembered everything in the human form then we wouldn't learn anything or make new choices.

Paleo,fl2ijs7,t3_fltlxy,1584751852.0,"Refined foods are the larger issue, but also think what your ancestors ate. For instance mine are native (canada), and the other side is France and England. So - we had 4 seasons; we had winter. Eating fruit all day was not something that was possible- and I'm talking 20 thousand years ago to 200k. 

We ate what we could, seasonally.  Go for a walk in the woods and  notice how many fruit trees you see about. Answer? Like none. The odd berry Bush. That stuff was a luxury and only eaten on certain occasions.

We were also scavengers more than anything. Finding food to kill can be hard - especially long ago when there were some very large animals on the earth. We were not the top of the food chain.

We would survive off nuts, and berries and  anything we could pick off a plant, along with insects no doubt. If we stumbled upon a half dead animal - we ate nothing but meat for 2 days until it' was gone.

I think major issue with our modern diet is 1. Eating to much (were built for famine) and 2. Mixing foods like meat with vegetables and fruits.

I think the ideal diet would be somewhat of a vegetarian for 4 days (including things like nuts), then eating  nothing but meat for a couple days."

It makes no sense, and is a silly notion created by people. 

The only thing that can benefit the glory of god, whatever that is, is service to yourself and others- experiencing what life has to offer. Prayer, insitituons, are spiritual or religious only insofar as they can help us be more in tune with ourselves (god), our own spirit. That's it. 

The end times is a different question, and one spoken of cross culturally. It has nothing to do with the concept of the rapture, or jesus or christianity.

That's another subject altogether tbh.

spirituality,fjt39vj,t1_fjqpsfg,1583603337.0,"Hey thanks:) I highly suggest watching/ studying some noah elkrief videos . He uses logic to explain how thoughts create emotions.

Here's one on ""how to be happy in life and why you aren't already happy"" https://youtu.be/4AOxCzHOYso

Here's one on loneliness: https://youtu.be/493lAJo3xx4

Find some creative outlets - start a yotube channel on something ! And work on you!

The best thing to do is, when your having a negative emotion about something, try to stop and examine the thoughts your telling yourself in that moment. Does the act of being alone cause unhappiness? What about people who live by themselves in the woods for years and are completely happy. The real world fact doesn't cause loneliness , only our thoughts about it. I would examine and go over scenarios like that and realize your situation isn't causing it, its your thoughts about it. What are some positives? The grass is always greener, right? Someone with no time to be alone might be super jealous of your situation.

Maybe try to make some acquaintances of like mind, through meet up groups online etc.

But yeah def check out Noah's stuff. He has new videos out which I haven't watched much, but his older stuff helped me get a grasp on my emotions years ago when I was going through my own thing (s). 

Also, the Kolbrin. You can read most of it online, but it has some deeply profound and spiritual stuff regarding life. Worth digging into"

spirituality,fjpqt2f,t3_fen3ac,1583558536.0,"Tip: nobody can make you happy - they can only provide moments, in a sense. Why? Because nobody can change the thoughts in our head. People can provide distractions from our thoughts - but what happens when were alone next, or going to bed ? Those thoughts come back. 

You have to examine the thoughts that make you unhappy, and disbelieve them. Sounds silly  but if you dont believe something to be true, then it has no emotional reaction. 

If a stranger on the street yells I love you - you'd probably laugh. If your parents or partner said I love you - you'd probably have an emotional reaction.  The same thing was said but one illicited a reaction , and that's because you believe one to be true. 

If your feeling down about being alone, or a yearning (which is you telling yourself you'd be happier if your life was like this or that), then stop and examine those thoughts. 

How do you know you'd be happier ? Does being in a relationship  make people happy ? Lots of people are in unhappy relationships.  Does being alone mean your unhappy ? Lots of people who are alone, are happy. The facts are the same - but their thoughts about it are not. Maybe being alone means you have more free time to persue passions you otherwise wouldn't? Maybe if you met someone tomorrow and on the way to the next date your hit by a car ? 

The point is you don't know - nobody knows. We only have ideals in our head that we think will make us happy and we constantly try to bend life to fit that, in in those efforts we become unhappy when we fail. 

The key is to be in the moment, which is...difficult to do. But it's a goal worth striving for."

Every action and thought on earth molds and shapes the light form,  if ones life was corrupt and self centered, the soul is misshapen, malformed, and even those who do not judge are in shock.
