Christian,fj47dax,t3_fbe9yo,1583001959.0,Absolutely! A lot of us have begrudging sins still. This is spiritual warfare and I would look into that more. I will be praying for you!
Christians,fj45las,t3_f0loz9,1583000799.0,"As a Christian, this is the way we should always conduct ourselves, with love. First and foremost, always with love. Iâ€™m so glad you got to see the beautiful side of Christianity and Jesus opposed to the ugliness many decide to represent themselves with. 

We may be the only Bible someone reads and we should want them to be reading the love that Christ commanded us to lead with."
Bible,fj450t0,t3_fbej0f,1583000429.0,"I would say youâ€™d have to. God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. Do some things apply? No. Thatâ€™s why Jesus was sent. Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice. There is a lot of history and prophecy that attention should be paid to. The gospel should be what you follow diligently though. Jesus maps out what we should be doing as Christians. That doesnâ€™t mean to throw out the OT. A lot of people like to use the OT and twist it for their agenda though and that needs to be heeded with caution"

socialskills,fj2h3wb,t3_faxtjx,1582943519.0,"Good for you. I think men face a stigma that they arenâ€™t allowed to say no and itâ€™s honestly disgusting. We talk about how poorly men take rejection but in my experience, women tend to take rejection far far worse. Iâ€™m so glad you stood your ground. This needs to be more accepted."
