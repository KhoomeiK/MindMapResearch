It's about the small steps at this point. It sounds like you're working hard but have little money.. for me the financial stress was the first thing I had to tackle. However I ended up not getting that completely solved until I solved my mindset. 

This is not an easy road, but take a step back from your life for a moment -- what would you say to yourself as a friend? I encourage you to treat yourself this way and not to write anything off. How you talk to yourself is a huge thing that I think a lot of people overlook. 

I can't tell you what's going to work for you, but you sounds determined enough to find the answers-- just keep trying. And reach out to family and friends -- you may be surprised at how many people want to help and even if they don't you're no worse off.

I hope this helps. I'm shit at answering things on Reddit, but happy to help if I can."

I remember crying andwriting this. I felt compelled to write it, it just poured out almost as fast as I could write it. Then a few quick changes to make it flow better.

And I flipped the page and didn't see it again.

Except depression is like trying to walk with broken legs and people saying to just keep trying. Definitely have to focus on getting better before you can walk. 

HOWEVER I've been depressed. I didn't suffer as long as some others just a couple years. It feels impossible, but party of rehab for your brain is training it to think on more productive ways and escape the negative loops. It takes work and time, but there IS something you can do."

Remember that getting help is a strong thing to do. I saw a psychologist for awhile, and it's been awhile but I'm going to find another one soon (I've moved) That outside perspective can be very helpful. He's the one who suggested Brene Brown to me!

depression,f2oxf0u,t1_f2oveuy,1570334676.0,"I feel for you-- you sound just like I sounded. Brene is awesome, so I hope you do read those books. She has a hugely popular TED talk, if you want to get the flavor of the books.

Let me challenge you to do this: be proud of yourself for getting on here and seeking help and community. That's progress, whether you like it or not! :) I'm proud of you, anyway. 

Before you go to sleep tonight, please talk to yourself as you would a friend. And then listen to what you said and let it sink in. I bet it will be way nicer than your inner monologue, and it's way closer to the truth. 

By the way, I think teachers don't get nearly enough credit. I love to teach but never wanted to teach in schools because it's seems way too hard and underappreciated. So thank you for your contribution there. 

Much love!"
depression,f2otbnz,t1_f2or0qb,1570333065.0,"It took some time, honestly. I had to work on treating myself like I would treat a friend. And really acknowledge that those small things really do matter and were actually worth being proud of. 

Before I figured that out I would think ""big whoop, anyone can [insert any small progress]."" I felt shame that I couldn't accomplish more. 

Accepting where I was at and not comparing to others helped me a lot. 

Brene Brown's book ""The Gift of Imperfection"" really helped me start making real progress. ""Daring Greatly"" is also fantastic. 

Are you proud of your accomplishments in life? Those things you mentioned-- newly tenured, teaching full time, fellowship, etc -- are you proud?"

depression,f2opft6,t3_ddxq0x,1570331569.0,"I felt like that years ago. For quite awhile, too. It was around the time the last Harry Potter movie came out, and I remember watching Hermione magically making the memory of her disappear for her parents and thinking that would be nifty. Would be cool to erase myself like that. 

So you're not alone, please know that. I was never suicidal, but wished I could be. Life felt so flat. Why did I exist? 

My advice? Take in as much positivity as you can and really try to believe it. Start small, because if you're like I was it will feel disgusting and pointless at first. But you've got to reprogram your brain, so keep going. Also try making yourself do things you used to enjoy. 

Start small. Let yourself be proud of small victories. And expect to take two steps forward and one step back. It'll feel like you're getting nowhere, but I've day you'll be relatively happy and life will have flavor again. 

But you've gotta fight. 

Happy to give more specific suggestions about what worked for me, although I think everyone has their own path. Sounds like you want to find it -- good luck!"

depression,es558v5,t1_es3fjsr,1561601997.0,"Who is your future self? Do you want to have the same opinion of them? 

I didn't.. I got so mad that nothing was changing in my life; that yet ANOTHER year had gone by and I was STILL in the same place. Depressed and miserable. Poor. Watching everyone around me have more and do more.. So I started making changes. Went through a few job changes, it definitely got a bit worse before it got better, but the fact that I was taking action made me feel better about myself. 

Don't just wait for things to get better. DO things and then keep doing things. At least you'll know you tried. I made that decision 3 years ago. So much happier now. I make a little more money, but the biggest difference is in the quality of life. 

Who do you want to be? Try like hell to be that person."

I only say that because I was depressed. You sound depressed, which as you know means your brain is sick. Please go talk to a professional. Even though it will cost money. That was a huge concern for me, and I wish I did it sooner. 

Decide that you want to feel good again. That's the first step. Decide you want to feel good again- that feeling you think is impossible to get back (at least I thought that was likely true). 

If you decide to fight through it, you'll be ok. It will take time, and sometimes you'll wonder why you're trying. But one day you'll be mostly happy (normal human stuff) and so glad you fought. I promise.

Be patient, and start searching for things to help you. Say positive and hopeful things about you and your life (even if you don't believe them yet). Look for people who inspire you online, and listen to them often. I promise it helps in the long run. 

Good luck. I believe in you."
