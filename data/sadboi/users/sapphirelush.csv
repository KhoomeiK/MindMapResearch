Anxiety,f69a6ft,t3_dqma8w,1572739090.0,"This is so true. I get so anxious in certain work situations, like in meetings or when I have to present in front of a group, but I don't really have a choice, so instead I come across as super secure and like I know what I'm talking about, even though I'm freaking out inside. Doesn't make me anymore anxious, just a way to cope."
WeHateMovies,f5qlbg9,t1_f5pmav2,1572378936.0,"Same here. I love The Day After Tomorrow and Space Cowboys. I've seen them both tons of times. And yet it was fun to hear the guys tear them apart. On the other hand, they are very into The Last Jedi, which I didn't enjoy. It's also okay. It really is okay to like/not like a movie."
oneplus,f5psuui,t3_donn8q,1572367012.0,"I went from a 3T to the 7 Pro. My 3T was working fine, but after too many drops the screen finally shattered. Then I dropped it once more and the poor thing went dark.

I'm really enjoying my 7 Pro. It's a little unwieldy because the size, but the performance is worth it.

My old 3T now feels tiny (I had the screen replaced to use it as my podcast phone at home)."

USCIS,eq67ej0,t3_bxcef6,1559823580.0,"I had my interview on Tuesday May 21. 

On Friday May 24 I got an email notification that the card had been shipped.

On Sunday May 26 my husband and I got our approval notices in the mail.

On Tuesday May 28 I got an email with a tracking number for my card.

On Wednesday May 29 the card got delivered to my lawyer's office.

I don't think this is necessarily indicative of average timelines. It's just our experience. For further reference, we are in Miami. The lapse between our original application and having our interview scheduled was 2 years."

USCIS,eoklsde,t3_bs6mpj,1558657624.0,"We had our interview the day before yesterday. We were super nervous but also very prepared. The interviewer asked me most of the questions (I'm the applicant) but she was very kind and put us at ease. What our lawyer told us was just don't lie. They will ask questions to verify you are in a bona-fide marriage, but they know there's always questions you will not know the answer, and it's better to admit it than lie, or to appeared rehearsed.
I was worried because I still don't know my husband's cellphone number. I barely know mine.
The interviewer really appreciated the photos, even though our wedding was super tiny and we only had about 10 people there, our emotions looked genuine.

In the end it's impossible not to be nervous, but if the relationship is legit, you will be ok.

I did get approved, by the way."
