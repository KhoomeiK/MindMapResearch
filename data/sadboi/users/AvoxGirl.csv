cymbalta,fd6k2n1,t3_ek6o4n,1578192229.0,"I can’t say that this would work for you in the US, but some pharmacists have the directive to fill existing prescriptions. If you take your empty bottle or box to the pharmacy and let them know you’re situation they may be able to give you enough to tide you over till you get back home. I’ve done this a number of times when I go on vacation and forget them at home (never in the US though). You can also give them the contact number of the pharmacy back in Canada and they can confirm the prescription. They will likely charge you for this (they do in Canada anyways) it will likely be a small fee above the cost of the drug - unless your health insurance will cover it there. 

If nothing else just ask the Pharmacist what to else you can do. They are usually very kind people and do want to help their patients. I hope you get something sorted out, I know how rough it is to not have your meds when you need them ❤️"

If you want tax dollars to pay for hospitals and not peoples donations at the LCBO, feel free to vote and stop electing people like Doug Ford who make profound cuts to things like health care.

We should also be looking at more non-hormonal options - such as the copper IUD. Hormones are likely what is causing these symptoms, because hormones also help regulate mood.

vaporents,f22wwgj,t1_f22ubbu,1569899055.0,"So I’m still kinda new to vaping so keep that in mind - but different temps release different terpenes, which can lead to different medical effects. 

Additionally usually people start at a lower temp and then once it stops producing vapor they increase it - this ensures your getting the best use of your bud and stretching it the farthest. I’m not too picky about that and I enjoy the taste at lower temps so I just hang out there."
vaporents,f22oh4k,t3_dbkqn1,1569893158.0,"I second the Pax 2. I have a Pax 3 - the only difference is the 3 has a concentrate oven. If you’re only gonna do dry herb all you need is the 2. This is my first vape and it’s been more than worth the money.

I use the half pack lid when I’m alone. In my opinion with the full pack lid it would probably compare to a full bowl. It’s pretty stealthy but not e-cig worthy. It is sleek though so it’s not really obvious. It also holds a charge pretty good, I’ve used it for a up to 5 one person sessions without needing to charge. I find it quick and easy to pack once you get used to it.

Downsides are that it smells more than other vapes, it gets pretty warm (apparently - I don’t find mine too bad but I vape on a lower temp). It also tasted awful for the first couple of sessions - got better after I used it then cleaned it."

TwoXSex,f1cogx6,t3_d8mx13,1569361975.0,"First of all - high five on the supporting her through this. You’re already halfway there in my opinion.

Secondly - I’ve (31F) been in her shoes before. Raised Catholic till I was 18, I’m still working through some of these same issues. I was never taught that sex could be safe and fun - more often then not it was fear mongering around STIs and pregnancy, and pushing abstinence. Forget discussing oral sex - it’s not supposed to happen because it doesn’t lead to procreation! Masturbation - I didn’t even know what that was till I was 16! 

From my own experiences (not an expert), one of the best things that helped this was finding understanding partners who would explore, slowly the fun pleasurable parts of sex for the woman. And most importantly, making it about me. You may have a raging hard on but if she passes out after you go down on her - kiss her lightly on the forehead and move on. I say this because my impression of sex was also skewed drastically my partners who made me feel like it was my DUTY to “take care of them” after they pleasured me. There shouldn’t be a tally or a score like that - now I want to pleasure my partner (most times) after I get off, but before when it was “expected” I’d often be holding back tears. Obviously not saying that’s what you’re doing - but I find our culture often portrays this kind of behavior, especially in heterosexual porn.

Additionally - when she’s ready, which probably isn’t just yet - I found that the book The Ethical Slut helped me break down some of the barriers I had around my own sexuality and frame of mind around sex. It can lean a little toward a non-monogamous relationship type bias, but that’s not it’s focus. Also a great audiobook version on Audible.

Good luck on your journey, but I feel like you’re already well on your way by having open conversations and by how accepting and understanding you’re being."

I keep going back to monogamous norms and I know that’s not going to work nor is it entirely what I want. Part of me just wants to be okay letting it evolve how it evolves, but then there’s a part of me that’s holding my heart close because I don’t want to be hurt. I also know, because I’m a married poly person, I’m also setting myself up a bit for heartache because there are certain things that I can’t offer a partner — making navigating this feel even riskier. Uncharted waters man!"

My last partner meet-up did not go so well - both my paramour and my primary were kind of awkward about it... hopefully we can figure it out better for future meetings. I’d love to have partners that could be friends."
