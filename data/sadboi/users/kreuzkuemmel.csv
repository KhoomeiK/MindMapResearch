During my first depression I've noticed that my memories lost meaning (they did not induce any emotion in me at all) and my brain started to erase many of them. At the end of 6 months in depression I ended up losing the most of the memories from my high school years and was unable to recover them.

I've also noticed that taking MDMA occasionally did help me reevaluate my previous experiences and changed my approach towards these permanently. So it makes total sense to me."

I have to add though that I had problems during my bachelor college years. Before I had my first depressive episode I was always very successful academically. But then I had a 6 months depression where I failed most of my classes due to not being able to function. I mean, taking a shower after 5 weeks of stinking was an achievement for me then. I was even planning to commit suicide if it lasted one more month. But I have quickly found a good psychiatrist and meds combination working for me (Lustral, Depakine and Seroquel). After this episode it took me 1 year to catch up with all my classes and readjust my social circle. I did not have any problems at college thereafter. 

I am currently in remission. Not using any meds. But I still struggle with my mood waves and anxiety and stress levels. I have a clear routine in my life, which I occasionally break so that it doesn't get too boring. The physical work helps me a lot, making me tired, hence enabling me to fall asleep before midnight. And being busy leaves little time for my brain to overthink and get stressed about weird shit. üòÅ

Edit: When I normally take time off, I do holidays somewhere I can swim and chill and and party and learn about the local culture or history.

bipolar,fjb6t63,t3_fcepis,1583187632.0,"Well, isn't that what depression really looks like? You probably don't want anything at all, including getting better. Because you lack the chemicals in your brain to make ""wanting"" work. And it will switch back to being able to want things as the depression fades away, maybe so that you won't even exactly remember how this felt like. That's why I get so disappointed when people perceive depression as being sad. To me it is mostly what you describe.

I know it doesn't mean so much for you right now but just remember that it will be possible to pull yourself out of it once the depression starts to get lighter and milder. Because then you start to slowly be able to want things again and have a bit of energy to do it. Waiting until then is hard, but it works too, you know, accepting depression as a thing that happens and is a bit mechanical makes it easier to wait for me.

In the first one I was 15 years old and started to develop a fascination for violence. I was a young sweet caring empathetic girl with a good social life.

I even told my mom that she should lock the door when she goes to sleep, because I was afraid of harming her. I don't remember how it disappeared, but this phase lasted roughly a year.  And it was long before my diagnosis. 

The second one was a couple years after my diagnosis when I stopped taking valproic acid. Before that I was scared of what my manic self is capable of, very scared to have episodes. I had labeled everything associated with mania as utterly bad in my head. And the medication was making me emotionally numb. When I got off the medication, a side of me that was more up and closer to my manic self started to resurface. And there I immediately percieved it as another person in me.

Sure, bipolarity causes a persons feelings and thoughts to change drastically when they are not stable. But unless he is newly diagnosed and has no clue what bipolar is, I'd say what you describe is also a lot about his personality, not just bipolar.

I am bipolar and I always try to warn people about what might happen to upset or disappoint or surprise or challenge or amaze them about me. I don't suddenly break up with people. If I have the urge to do that, I talk to the person about my feeligs and thoughts and wait to see if these persist. There are a lot if bipolar people who are compassionate and try to take responsibility for the part of their actions they can actually manage, and not just say ""It's ok for me to fuck up people because I have bipolar to justify it.""

I don't know this guy you are talking about, but maybe he is very self-absorbed that he doesn't care what his decision does to you. Being self-absorbed might be a temporary condition caused by a bipolar episode, in which case he could still warn you about that he becomes like that unless he is newly diagnosed or still clueless about what bipolar really is. But it can also be that he is just a self-absorbed person independent of his bipolarity. Point.

Please don't excuse someone's behaviour just because they have bipolar. They can still learn how to manage it to a reasonable degree. I don't blame the ones who don't want or try to manage it, they can do whatever they want with it. But that's a choice, not what it has to be."

I don't understand why you put his condition and his needs in the center of your life.

When there is an episode, the danger of an episode or harsh BP related mood swings, sure you gotta be there and help as much as you can, but without pushing your own limits too much for you to take.

My partner has been there for me every single time when I practically really needed him, when he could do sth conrete to help me, even if it's just being present around me. But he hasn't always been emotionally available on my demand. In our daily life when he needs to be distant and aloof when I want closenes, or to be active and outgoing when I'm lazy and down, he does what he prefers. He has always been like that and I've learnt to live with and respect that. There were many times I complained about that he doesn't give me the emotional support I need and I've been used to get from previous partners, but the fact is I survive it with only some brokenheartedness and he gets to be himself rather than a caretaker.

Shouldn't he be praising you for doing sth to work with your condition? Would he belittle a person with diabetes for taking insulin? And what shall one do when the heart is sending contradicting messages to the brain? ü§î
bipolar,evv5clg,t3_clcrrf,1564820245.0,The first time I took seroquel was the first time in my life I actually fainted. And I don't even faint on an alcohol coma. LOL.
bipolar,evta14n,t3_cl2dz7,1564765983.0,LOL and face palm.
bipolar,esy1y3o,t3_c9e9g2,1562337988.0,Sometimes I do exactly this with Freddy with exactly the same changes in my facial expression :D
bipolar,erjqsi6,t3_c2dtaq,1560943428.0,Amateurs think that depression is a hardcore version of feeling sad an unsatisfied all the time. They get confused when I tell them I was feeling so inhumane due to not being able to feel or care about or value anything that I'd be fucking glad to feel the worst pain or sadness in the entire universe just to feel sth. You know it when you actually have it. :)
bipolar,erjqhmn,t3_c2928a,1560943071.0,Now I'm really curious about if and how the conversation proceeded! :D
bipolar,eq96out,t3_bxgy0l,1559890391.0,"So many times I had to convince myself that I'm not being manipulative and just speaking my mind, while also trying to not panic because I might be just so fucking good at manipulation that I am manipulating myself into believing that I'm not. :D We have feelings and thoughts covering a very broad spectrum when we consider the long term course of this disorder and sometimes we are pretty self-aware. And I guess the main issue here is that we think a fucking lot more about these and name them and be aware of them compared to others."
bipolar,eq5uq05,t3_bxc7e0,1559814703.0,"I figured that thinking too much about how people's moods get affected by my behaviour and being anxious about it is mostly what changes the vibe to a weird one. So I don't really care anymore. As long as I don't hurt anyone physically or psychologically, they shouldn't give much of a fuck. And if they do, that's not my problem. I just try to stick with the stable but easygoing and kinda crazy people, when I see them. They can just say sth like ""you're dumb"" and laugh it off. That's what I do."
bipolar,eq5u173,t3_bx1hv0,1559814144.0,Great work. I'm outta words.
bipolar,epzsvpw,t1_epzmnpy,1559672002.0,"For me the pillars of my mental health are the sleep cycle, the low-carb healthy diet, a small but stable social circle, and work. Especially if you like your coworkers / team, it gives you a feeling of continuity and stability, which is what we usually try to achieve as bipolar people. Even if I don't want to work on a certain day, I like to go there and sit at my desk and have the same people around me because it gives me that feeling. And a comment on the sleep cycle issue: try not letting that abnormal cycle continue for more than a couple of days. If you already have a method to go back to being able to sleep at night time and around 7-8 hours per day, you really avoid a huge portion of the trouble coming as motivational drain and swings. But if you don't have one yet, I recommend talking to your doctor and finding a method you can apply at those times to get you back on normal sleep cycle as soon as possible. And remember, lots of people have problems keeping up motivation to work regardless of if they are bipolar or not. As far as I can tell from your writing, you are already doing well so try to feel good about that! :)"
bipolar,epypsl8,t3_bwhjhx,1559647349.0,"There are the waves under our feet but what happens depends also on how we ride those waves. And nothing is in your control, but you are one of the factors in what happens and how it happens."
bipolar,epyg8wi,t3_bwerqp,1559632989.0,"Work feels good for me in general. Although I get stressed over it, I know I'll get stressed over sth in any case and that thing might very well be just my work. And honestly, going to work helps keeping my sleep cycle in check and work itself keeps me and my brain busy. I find it better than getting too bored and doing impulsive shit just because of that. But I'm careful about burnouts. Sometimes I do take on too much work because I'm impulsive and up and overly confident. But if I try to put that energy into use somewhere else and manage to avoid this, it's fine."
bipolar,epyfd1q,t1_epybw3a,1559631659.0,Exactly :D
bipolar,eptlddq,t3_bvxhxq,1559492604.0,"I had them pretty often during mania. Mine feels more like my brain is so active that it can kinda dream on the background when I'm awake. Hearing my name being called by someone, especially when I'm alone is what scared me the most back then actually. Now I'm used to having these auditory hallucinations occasionally and don't get paranoid like before. But it can still be annoying if it gets more frequent. Then it feels like being poked every 30 seconds without a reason. Or if you have watched the ""annoying orange"" videos, a bit like that sometimes."
bipolar,ep6k8fr,t3_bttn7x,1559070118.0,"Me too. Well, even before learning to masturbate I was inspecting it like a hi-tech machine that ended up in my hands and I have no clue what it's for. :D But yeah, there might be a connection."
bipolar,ep6jo1y,t1_ep62ehz,1559069913.0,"I have also tried it for a bit and agree with this. I tend to use it especially when I'm having the weird moods at the same time as my period, works well.

Also I recommend reducing the sugar consumption, even totally avoiding if you can. I notice a drastic positive change in my mood swings and anxiety when I just don't eat any sugar. But it wouldn't work if trying not to eat sweets stresses you too much, so that depends on you."
bipolar,ep6hrn6,t3_btzal6,1559069176.0,"Guess you are already out of work, since you posted 6 hours ago. You see, this is what I think about when I'm sometimes sitting at work and getting huge headaches and feeling like I want to disappear: ''In 6 hours I'll be out and my future self will just be glad it's over. I don't need to do anything special but just pretend to be a machine or exist here for 6 hours and it will be finished on its own. Because time passes.'' It works for me. And you don't need to hang in there forever, it really gets much better than you can imagine once you find the right psychiatrist & meds & dosage combination for yourself. That's why you gotta find them as soon as possible. And don't hesitate to be demanding a psychiatrist to really try to find the right ones for you after a thorough examination. That's their job. That's also the best thing you can do as a dad: take care of yourself so that you can be there for them. Well ok, in this case, find a good psychiatrist who helps you to take care of yourself. Hope you are there and read this."
BipolarSOs,eoupmt6,t3_bt592j,1558877008.0,"Sex depends a lot on the mood. Even though I don't really have episodes anymore but rather smaller waves and swings, my sex drive goes up and down a lot between depression and mania. Many of the things you mention about her sexual behaviour I observe in almost every BP person I know including myself. So I'd say do not take it personal. Imagine you are depressed as hell, you watch porn to masturbate, but the sadness makes it all seem weird even if you are physically capable of feeling and coming. It's a bit like that. The main question is if you are OK with your sexual life changing character with her moods. And also if you are OK with the possibility of having a sexually pretty open relationship bc she might want that around manic episodes. And that would also not be about you but her. It makes me so fucking happy when a partner is confident about themselves and our relationship and does not mind me screwing around. That makes me appreciate them greatly and gives me a feeling of safety bc then I know I can just be myself and act according to my needs without worrying about if I am harming them emotionally. That's a big comfort to have. So I suggest that you openly talk about what she wants in the long term, what she knows about her sexual behaviour and tendencies, and then think about if you are fine with that. Don't suspect her lying to you (unless she's manic, which she is currently not as far as I understood) or make it a personal issue. I wish you good luck and hope that you guys can work it out bc it sounds like things are actually going well for you two. :)"

bipolar,eoiak31,t3_bry95b,1558615060.0,I have moved into a new flat in December. But I did not arrange the furniture much immediately since I did not have the money and time to invest in it. Now I check out second hand furniture or move things around and improve the flat as a long-term project. Pretty enjoyable I'd say and definitely helps putting the energy in good use.
bipolar,eoia24u,t3_brtznh,1558614678.0,"I suck at keeping up sth as a long term hobby. The only thing I could establish so far is to cook an interesting meal for at least half of the week, because I'm a foodie. Recently I have decided to bake bread because I thought ""I'll start PhD soon and have a lot of scientific knowledge, but I still don't know how to bake bread, which is ancient technology. WTF."" And it was really satisfying to see eat it afterwards. üòÖ"
