Then I‚Äôd have a serious sit down with my son about how he will be responsible for another human for the next 18 years and to strongly encourage proper birth control methods and (romantic) relationship priorities vs. being a parent going forward as he will have his hands full as it is for a very long time before he‚Äôs ever in a place to care for more than one child. 

Don‚Äôt give him a chance to come home, find out you know and then run off to manipulate this girl or panic away from home. Sit him down when he comes in with a meeting set up with the other parents and then send him to bed for proper rest before you address it."

She‚Äôs said it clearly that she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship with you (‚Äúright now‚Äù even if she mean in general) and for your own sake I would back right off to avoid being hurt if she‚Äôs put into the situation of having to sever ties with you. 

It sounds like you‚Äôve built up some good foundational social skills all the same. You should challenge yourself and develop your skill in many different environments to be the best you.

Mitigating weight gain with eating better will help, but to actively and consistently drop weight you‚Äôll need to be moving as much as possible, staying hydrated and sleeping well. 

If you‚Äôre not ready for the gym try to find ways to maximize being more active. Do a home workout following online videos every evening, volunteer with labour intensive groups like collecting donations for charity, get a simple but active job like delivering the newspaper, get a dog?!, meet with a dietician and trainer to draw up a plan, tour gyms to get more comfortable with the environment or try specific exercises like joining a yoga class. 

It‚Äôs hard to switch up your lifestyle so take it a day at a time and just be kind to yourself. Everyone slips up and that‚Äôs okay, there‚Äôs always the next choice to choose healthy! Good luck!"

Make an ‚ÄúEco-Map‚Äù of as many of the contacts in your life and then list each person with what kind of relationship (stressful, harmful, broken, beneficial, balanced, healthy, joyful, estranged, ect) and if the energy going into and coming from the other person is balanced.

Then, write each of those significant people a letter about how their relationship with you makes you grateful for the connection.

Poor communication and no efforts on compromise on anyone‚Äôs part. It seems like no one is actually talking to MIL about her behaviour and just throwing ultimatums down behind her back. It also sounds like you blindsided your wife with this demand. 

Time for you and your mother in law to figure it out and you‚Äôre gonna have to spell it out for her how unappreciated her behaviour is. Give her a chance with this new information and call out her bullshit real time if you have to, if there‚Äôs going to be drama either way at least try to make it productive. Then have a follow up with MIL after Christmas that going forward if she wants to upstage and stir the pot she will have to make a separate tradition with just your wife and kids then distance yourself as much as you can. You can‚Äôt stop your wife from seeing her mother if she doesn‚Äôt want to but then they can arrange it elsewhere if it‚Äôs as toxic as you claim it is. 

Throwing down an ultimatum 33 days before Christmas against someone who is so narcissistic that may have had no idea people were annoyed is gonna spin it hard to make you the bad guy, no exceptions, you won‚Äôt come out on top with that approach, especially if others don‚Äôt share your opinion. You‚Äôve got a year to really speak your mind and get some better habits and boundaries developed with the in-laws for what could be a great Christmas next year. Don‚Äôt give up, try a new strategy."
