OCD,f23rmc4,t3_dbk25n,1569935774.0,"I have this exact problem. Could have written your post. I can share what I’ve been doing but it’s a little corny. I was super hesitant to adopt but since I’ve been trying it I’ve had some piece of mind. 

Ok, think of a name you don’t associate with someone (not a friend or someone you know). Mine starts with G. When I notice thoughts come up that I think others are aware of my thoughts/ being judgmental/ *insert distortion* I try to pause before I spiral into anxiety long enough to distance myself from the negativity. The Negative thoughts belong to G. So literally when they pop up I ...

1) Take some deep breaths

2) Say “shut the heck up G!, you’re getting in the way of me doing x”

3) Ego check, nobody is that obsessed with me....if they were and wanted to be negative something is wrong with them not me...also screw the haters!

4) If at this point I’m still struggling I turn on some music and drown the thoughts out with some upbeat music.

This works for me. Maybe you will find something useful in there. Either way, I hope you find a way to cope because I know what a daily struggle it can be! Good luck!"
