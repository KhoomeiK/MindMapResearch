I lived in Brooklyn when they started finding all of the bodies and Shannon was still missing but her mom and sisters were so adamant about investigating her case bc they knew it was linked. And idk, Shannon was so just so beautiful, and she was so loved and I always wanted justice for her. Eventually her body was found. Her family was right. 
The weird thing is why she didn’t get in the car with the driver?  If you’re an escort you have a driver, they wait for you. I forget where she was coming from (the city or Jersey?), but that would’ve been whatever hourly rate for Shannon, plus an EXTRA extra out call fee for Gilco beach because it is so remote. The driver is like her protection from being raped, killed, not paying the agency (if she was working for one), and also for keeping track of the time.  He gets paid, she gets paid. The driver waits for you. 

 Escorts in the city charge $800/hr for a young, pretty girl like her. Was she working for an agency  who posted on CL, or was she a renegade that responded to the add for LI?  I thought she was working for an agency bc she had a driver.  But then again, you could get drivers on CL back then, they posted adds too, so maybe she hired the driver?  I don’t remember the details...

I just can’t understand why she didn’t get in the car with the driver. UNLESS she was really scared saw something crazy and managed to escape and didn’t trust the driver.  Probably a new agency she was working with. Or she hired him for the night and didn’t trust him. Or the LI date (John) hired the driver to pick her up. Idk!!  It’s just so crazy!  

Do you guys think she just ran away and ended up drowning like they said?  

I’ve always been so obsessed with this; I saw the news, 20/20, disappeared, Netflix movie, etc. 

I just want to know what really happened to her!!!

I also did homework between classes and shit like that and I got by in HS like a lot of you. My working memory sucks and I always struggled with math bc of that.

We didn't pay when Trump came into office and they start threatening us.  I think we've probably been throwing money at other countries instead of calling their bluffs for years. Also, there is a lot of fraud in medicaid/medicare, IRS, etc.  We should spend more money investigating and give perpetrators more time in prison to think about how fucked up it is to steal tax payer dollars.

If they do not accept your claim it’s not a necessarily bad thing because now you can sue. But if the EEOC sues them on your behalf, you can’t sue. You can only sue after you’ve filled a claim through the EEOC.

Showerthoughts,fosk706,t3_g95b7a,1588032323.0,"This is interesting because I’ve had the same experience. However, I think accents (regrading English in the US), are not as distinct as they used to be because of the internet/social media over the last 20 years. It’s fascinating bc you don’t “hear” your accent, but you don’t have to leave your home now to find out you have one lol!  

Also, I think people in the US are more transient in general.  We are making connections thru the net in regards to jobs, universities, love, etc. 

OR!  I just thought about this..
When you have a cell phone you can easily record yourself. Maybe in doing that you can hear your accent; like maybe that’s another factor as to why (IMO), accents are typically not as noticeable as they used to be. I notice people say things but I don’t want to bore you guys"

neurodiversity,fosieve,t1_foqnetf,1588031319.0,"It’s a word; militant 
What’s the definition?  I just googled it, basically “combative and aggressive in support of a political cause”

Again, I didn’t read the original post but maybe the poster thought militant meant political activism, like they didn’t know the proper definition. It sounds crazy to have a militant neurodiversity movement, bombing corporations, taking hostages, etc. I’m actually laughing as I write this.

**and I’m NOT laughing at the seriousness of militant movements tho, like blowing up an abortion clinic and killing people or taking hostages in Columbia, kidnapping and decapatating hostages in the Middle East, etc. 

But at least take into consideration that it may have been a bad choice of words. I’m pretty sure if you’re in this sub you care about neurodiversity and you are prob ASD, ADHD, etc. 

Let’s help each other and keep this positive. God knows we deal with challenges every day that neurotypicals dont have."

Especially if you are a (young) woman. If you’re a young new guy they may say, “wow Mike’s great, he has a lot of energy and creativity and thinks outside the box, he’s got potential!, let’s invite him to poker night or drinks after work” 

If you’re a young female “who does she think she is?  Questioning upper management?  She’s totally disrespectful rude, out of line, a bitch”

I’ve seen this too many times in my career...basically ask instead of recommend. Like 

“Do you guys use...  (when you really want to say, you should use this) or 
“Have you ever tried ...

Also, sometimes there is a reason organizations do things even tho it may seem odd.  That’s why I always ask the question vs recommend."

I asked her after why she was singing for the junior varsity basketball teams when she was a senior and she said that was the VARSITY team..

My point?  At 19 years old, I thought “varsity” high school students (juniors and seniors) looked like children. And I was 19 

Imagine a 22 year old?  It’s weird. And any guy talking on the phone to a teenage girl for 7 hours is suspect hahaha!!"

Gross!  Then he has a SEVEN hour phone call with a 16/17 year old best friend of Hau?  

First off, wtf does a 22 yo male have to talk to a 17 year old girl about for 7 hours?  Then he visits her when she’s away from her parents visiting her sister under false pretenses...

Yes he was grooming her; it’s disturbing

Then he had a 7 hour phone call with her best friends after she died, like he was grooming her or something. Then he went to  visit this 17 year old girl when she was away from her parents visiting her sister in Baltimore city?

He also moved. The co worker said he shouldn’t have been on the schedule that day 

Also said he had scratches and bandages

What 22 year old would spend SEVEN hours on the phone with a 17 year old girl?!?!?"
adnansyed,fom1crl,t3_g4v9oy,1587875653.0,"The girls, sorority sisters saying they say him that day, dropped him off etc. 



If he didn’t say “hi” and introduce himself and act odd it was PROBABLY BC HE WAS HIGH lol. And didn’t she also testify that he said something about “how do I make the high go away?”

They both said they were not sure about the dates but the police 

If you aske me what I last Tuesday o could tell you probably but I wouldn’t know the DATE of last Tuesday, like off the top of my head

The police are to blame, not the girls that testified. The police lied to them and coerced them and they were so young at the time. They also wanted to help convict him bc they were told there was all of this evidence against him when there wasn’t 

Don is TOTALLY suspect
He was a pedaphile, (having sex with a 16 or 17 year old), her friend said she was meeting him that day after school, Don’s mom created his alibi, former employee said there was NO reason for him to be on the schedules that day and also said Don had scratch marks etc. 

**Don befriend the Aisha, talked to her for 7 hours on the phone (GROOMING), went to visit her when she was in Baltimore alone visiting her sister and made moves on her

Idk about you guys but when any guy that dated a high school girl after 20 would be laughed at!  It’s weird!  Like even when I was in college, of a college dude dated a high school girl it was like a joke, like he was loser. And Don was 22!!!!!!!

Also, he moved.. looks like his life is pretty shitty now and he made a comment about “most people don’t have the resources to find me”, sounds like he doesn’t want to be found.. also could bc of the case in general and the attention over the years. 

Jay moved too. I think he was just trying to save himself.  They prob told him he was looking at life as an accessory so he just told them what they literally wanted to hear. 

Wtf didn’t the cops interview Don in person?  I thought that’s what they typically do?  Anyone she was dating, involved with they interview in person, take pics (looking for evidence of defensive wounds).  Like why did Baltimore do all of the phone calls?  It’s so weird!!!"

Why cares my point is, this is a LITERAL story, like fiction, about some gang banger that wants to work for you, but prior to that they “tested” you to see if you would call the cops. Idk what movies you are getting this shit from this is just crazy haha!! Never ever ever ever ever would someone test you haha. And why would anyone want cops around!?!  Ever?!?! 

Why would someone  “test you” in the first place. And work for you? And if you own a company why are you in a hotel.
