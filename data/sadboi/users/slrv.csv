TransSupport,fqoc097,t3_gjzf3u,1589511883.0,"I came out, went full time, started hormones etc the summer before my senior year of high school.

My mental health was SHIT leading up to that. I had panic attacks nearly every day that summer, I was fixated on passing, on my body, I felt hopeless, I felt overwhelmed. There was so much to navigate, and so much anxiety and depression. So I feel you there I guess.

I tried to distract myself to get through it, I spent a lot of time with supportive friends. I listened to music, played instruments, and went on hikes when I had the energy to.

School came. It was great, the administration was supportive so my name showed up as ""preferred"" on the roll, so teachers called that. I also switched to a new school that year, so really only my friends from the summer noticed and it felt good to be called my pronouns and just finally stop hiding and be out. It was a lot to process, but I was happy when I went home. I had great gender euphoria, which was basically a new feeling for me, and cried happy tears. I realized then how amazing it is to be trans sometimes; yeah, parts can suck, I flipped off my trans flag on my way to bed every night for the whole month before. But it's BADASS to just go on and be yourself despite of it all, to take things into your own hands and give a ""fuck you all"" to society for your own wellbeing.

I couldn't quite tell from your post if you're thinking about coming out yet, or just about starting hormones and maybe trying to stay closeted for a bit longer? I would say come out as soon as you can, and I'm sure you hear that a lot and it sounds so hard. It is. I don't think it'll get easier, it's worth it, and everything is so much better afterwards. There are still days that suck, my deadname would still get called by accident, I'd still have to take breaks in the bathroom. Worth it 100% imo.

I'd start by building a support network. If you have close friends and you haven't already, you should come out to them. Chances are pretty good that one of them are queer too, we tend to group together without knowing, and it's super great to have close queer friends you can vibe with. On that note, if you don't have close supportive friends, you could try reaching out to your schools GSA if they have one (I started one that same year) or any sort of LGBT/pride center in your area - they usually have youth programs that are a good way to meet people.

Best of luck, you can comment or DM me anytime. I feel for ya"
relationship_advice,fqoajej,t3_gjy920,1589510990.0,"Trans person here. respectful discourse encouraged, no cis nonsense

As other commenters have said, I agree that he should have mentioned this up front - especially mentioning that you had planned for kids etc. That's going to be tough to recover from, but there are solutions if you're both willing to work through it. Y'all might even want to consider therapy in navigating that, I COMPLETELY understand not being able to have kids in the way you want to. That really hits home. I guess I'm just saying there are solutions there, and you can still have a family with him. This will be a very difficult discussion for him as well, which is probably why he didn't have answers - in addition to any Trauma he's mentioned before, he probably also has trauma around his body, and fertility can be triggering all around. I'm not trying to diminish your situation at all, because that's really shitty and I feel for you, just trying to provide some perspective and explanation for some of his reactions. Also, the doctors usually go into pretty explicit detail about what is and isn't possible, and fertility options, throughout medical transition. Perhaps he just wasn't ready to discuss that with you. Which, I agree, is pretty fucked up - it's been a while, he hasn't been honest around it, that's going to be hard to rebuild from.

Sex. Preference can be more fluid than you would think, look up Lisa Diamond. Sure, he doesn't have the parts that you're aroused to right now but you can still be sexually active with him without going there. There are also some really cool toys for transmasc people to use during sex that are very realistic, so you could try navigating sex from there if you want. There are so many good things to do beyond the penetrative PIV sex that we're conditioned for. You may have genital preference, and that's fine, and I'm not saying your sexual orientation will change - he's no less of a man. Of course, all of that is just from my perspective, but again, he's probably got all kinds of trauma and body issues that makes sex really hard for everyone.

I don't know if you'll be able to fix things with him? Especially the dishonesty, and keeping this part of him from you for so long. If you do, it will take a lot of work from both of you and it will be a hard process, but you'll know your partner even better and fall even deeper in love."
relationship_advice,fqo9cxp,t3_gjzhug,1589510276.0,"hello fellow baby queer! :)

Is this one of your first kisses? Or at least, one that you've actually been into? I totally get not being able to date and figure out that kind of thing until a hot second after the straight people, but let me know if I'm making some bad assumptions.

Honestly, in my experience at least, the first time (first few, for me) was hella awkward and not that great? Neither of us knew how to do it, but if you want to do it then I think you should go ahead. Just be really open with her, embrace the awkwardness. Seize the moment, you'll feel a second of ""um, should we kiss?"" Stop putting it off, just go ahead and look her in the eyes and say ""hey, can I kiss you?"" If she says yes then go for it.

Like I said, it was underwhelming for me - I wasn't really into it until about 5 months into dating my current partner, but I'm also on the ace spectrum so that's probably part of it.

Good luck!!! <3

edit: I read over your post again a second time, it feels very risky to kiss her while you're at her house if she's not out. If there aren't other options, then also have a backup plan for if you're discovered and how you will both deal with the aftermath. sorry, that's probably not helpful at all but that's my advice. As for when to kiss her, I'd say whenever you're alone and the mood is right."

The other commenters offer good advice, so I just want to repeat that. It's important that above anything else your child feels loved and accepted regardless of their identity and their gender, and I think you'll be good in that area.

I'd say definitely don't be afraid to explore, especially at their age. Social transition is totally reversible, and for some trans people that's enough and they don't even want medical transition. Some people also bring up ""detransition"" and paint it as this terrible, life-changing thing. If no irreversible medical changes were made, going back to their AGAB actually won't be a big deal at all, and then they'll know a little more about themselves. They might even go back and forth or find a home outside the binary, which is also chill. I guess I'm saying that at this point, it's okay if neither of you have the answers, and it's not going to be rigid. From your post it definitely sounds like your child is a binary trans guy, but it's not rigid and that can change. A good portion of kids who identify as trans or have gender non-normative behaviors early in life ""desist"" by puberty. But many don't.

I'm glad you're seeking therapy, but I know it can be tricky to find someone. If you can, I'd recommend looking for one who specializes in gender, ideally, someone who is [WPATH certified.](https://www.wpath.org/provider/search) They'll help you and your child figure out what's best for everyone, and kind of help you navigate everything.

I definitely feel the waiting list issue. There's a ton of waiting and gatekeeping. I don't know how much you know about puberty blockers, but at this age you'll probably be going for a GnRH analog. Your doctor will go over all of the details of course, but they're completely reversible and I don't know of any real health risks, except maybe losing an inch or two of height and loss of bone density if you're on them too long (on the order of decades). but don't quote me on that. They can also be stopped at any time; at that point, your child will just go through their natal puberty as normal. Or they can start taking testosterone to go through a male puberty (that decision is usually ~age 16, sometimes earlier). But yeah that's a pretty big decision that's still a good distance in the future, so you can cross that bridge when you get there.

Hopefully that made sense :)

edit: i forgot to mention how hellish natal puberty is for a lot of us, and how we have to live with that for the rest of our lives (or get expensive surgeries). if your child doesn't vibe with having a female puberty then absolutely get on blockers as soon as possible"
TransSupport,for3sbb,t3_g8wz9y,1588005683.0,"The informed consent documents should give a pretty good rundown, and talk to your doctor if you have any more questions.

transgenderteens,for37eu,t3_g8yod1,1588005399.0,"That's kind of a dicey situation, but it's gonna be really tricky to go on HRT for 2 years without them noticing. I would start ""testing the waters"" to see if you can get an idea of how they feel about trans people, and maybe come up with a plan for coming out from there if it looks good. Definitely have a backup plan in case it goes badly or they kick you out though.

I had similar feelings of hopelessness before coming out, that I'd waited too long, that I wouldn't pass, etc. Things turned out really good for me, 18 is still super young relatively and you'll get good results. As another comment pointed out, there are PLENTY of people who transition later in life and they're doing great!

I would recommend starting an anti-androgen if possible, especially if you're not done with puberty yet. If you can stop facial hair from coming in fully that will save you a lot of trouble later. I'm not sure what country you're in/how to get the drugs there if you're under 18 without parental consent, but if you can figure out how to do that I'd recommend it.

transgenderteens,ff66dkj,t3_ermktb,1579620221.0,"Hi!

In my experience, you don't usually need a therapist recommendation/any of those kinds of requirements to start blockers. Your pediatrician/physician can maybe prescribe it for you, but it really depends on the person.

I would do some Googling to find a gender clinic in your area, or an endocrinologist. You may also be able to get it from Planned Parenthood.

To start estrogen, it's a little more complicated, but right now getting blockers should definitely be a priority. At that appointment, you can also talk about what steps you want to take to move forward, including the process to get estrogen.
