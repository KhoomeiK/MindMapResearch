FanFiction,fp907tw,t3_gbxmgl,1588409322.0,"Not really fanfic, but I’m currently making an AU of a Colombian 90s show.

Okay, so it all started when I found it’s animated version while browsing through the internet and while watching a few episodes, I was just cringing at how bad it was, the characters were poorly drawn, messy story, bland jokes, just your typical 2000s forgettable kids show.

During the whole thing, I was all like “Bet I can do a few fixes to this” and just started redesigning the characters out of boredom, and they turned out a bit better.

Anyways, I liked the designs and started playing a bit with them on my free time, redrawing different episodes, poses, a few small comics, even doing an animatic for a fake intro.

And now, I’m currently doing concept art from all that shit, thinking of fully animating the animatic and even rethought the whole story to fit it into the universe (since the original series it’s definitely not for kids)

And that’s the story of how I accidentally made a ahijo anime out of a 99s show because I had lots of pet peeves about it’s animated version."

Then the thing got worst when she even played examples of electronic songs. I wanted to die right then and there because of the fact that the examples she was playing were songs that I showed her and kids were NOT reacting great with that.

Oh, and this gets better (or worst), during a part of her presentation where your classic clown class kids interrupted her and wouldn’t let her continue, she made them go in front of the class “”as punishment”” and sing to OPERA (obviously the kids were playing around and not taking it seriously.)
