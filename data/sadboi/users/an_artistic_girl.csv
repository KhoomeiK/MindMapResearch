ArtistLounge,fjvynxo,t3_ferdtk,1583632390.0,"dont let anyone tell you that a career in art is a waste of time. If it wasnt for artists, there wouldnt be all sorts if entertainments. There probably wouldnt be cars, company logos, decent interior decoration, etc. If you think about it, society relies a lot on artists. You go home after a long day, and the first thing you do? Watch tv. People risked left their old lives and  picked up acting because they LOVED it. They didnt care what happened, and so many celebrities have done this. Because of artists, we wouldnt be able to enjoy ourselves. Imagine a world without art."
ArtistLounge,fjvxe15,t3_ferdtk,1583632087.0,"Even after months or weeks of not trying to draw a decent drawing, I eventually got back into my creative stride. And you will too. Just dont force yourself. Let your imagination flow, and let yourself be inspired about what's around you. Dont feel guilty if you struggle to be creative again. Art is meant to be enjoyed, despite how difficult it can be sometimes. Dont compare yourself to other artists, embrace your style, dont worry about being ""realistic"" or following the rules of art. Just do YOU. I recently got back into art after months of not having the motivation to put out anything because I let myself breathe and dip into the creative pool to enjoy the water, not to immaediately force myself to learn and be able to swim. I set a goal for a piece, and if I didn't achieve it (like use a reference and my own images in my mind, to create something new instead of copying an image on my phone how it appears if that makes sense. I would use hands from one photo and then use my own imagination to get the exact image I had envisioned in my mind.) It is difficult. I dont know what your skill level is in art, but dont restrict yourself to any art form or medium. Knitting is art, making sculptures out of paper or origami, it's all art. Dont restrict your medium, explore a bit. After hating how messy and unclean my art was, compared to others' precise lines and clean sketches, I'm actually starting to fall in love with my style. It's unique, and I love it. Fuck, paint on your jeans if you want to. You're not wasting your time but not doing traditional art or something that's more common like digital art. If I was doing anything that wasnt painting or digital art, sketching, etc. I saw it as a waste of time, when in reality anything could be art. 

I hope you gain back your creative freedom, doesnt matter how long it takes, just matters if you keep trying.

Edit: Because of my depression, I felt just as empty and dry as you did. Without any creative juices flowing or any sprout of an idea or inspiration. Start by drawing anything. Draw your toilet if you want to lol. But just start from somewhere. Doesnt matter where. ‚ù§"

My depression has robbed away my love for art recently. I haven't felt like I could sit down and not get tired at creating something for hours and being inside that bubble where nothing else matters. I haven't felt that in so long, and the first time I've recently felt that way is when I was sculpting a skull out of clay for a project in one of my art classes. And at first I hated that project, it was so difficult and frustrating to work the clay and I hadn't really played with clay a lot like that, but later on I fell in love with it and didn't want to stop at all.

Especially since my dad isnt very understanding and says stuff like ""are you anxious? If you are, don't even try to drive"" but in a judgemental way :/ The argument I've used against myself to justify my courage in doing everyday university assignments is ""stop assuming the worst. Do what you can. It'll be okay. And if you mess up, it wont be the worst thing in the world"" but with driving...if you even fuck up one thing, it could cost you your life or the life of someone else. Or if you dont end up dying, you end up having the embarrassment of wrecking someone's car. I should probably take my own advice on this but...take deep breaths. Good thoughts only. Be aware of your surroundings. I tend to fuck up when I'm nervous. Just relax and dont tense up. Relax your shoulders, and enjoy the ride. Easier said than done, I know, but you can do it!
