FLMedicalTrees,fl63cft,t3_fmqzke,1584853119.0,I was for several months. It came to the point where I wasn't truly feeling the effects of THC but instead I was just feeling like I was trapped in a haze all day. Smoking all day went from being awesome to making me feel a bit dissociated. I've been on a t break for about 2 weeks now and it was the best decision I've ever made. I plan to start smoking again but only in moderation most likely at the end of the day.

First I thought the fan was ripping out my soul so I had to turn it off. Then I tried to go to sleep but I had a Super Jail esque dream that scared the fuck out of me so I couldn't sleep. The next 3 I had panic attack after panic attack. 17 yo me legitimately thought I was dying. Never smoked the stuff again."

 Has a summery vibe to it which is nice. A concern for me was the lack of impact. When all of the instruments come in for the chorus. Maybe add a bass hit or find a way to increase dynamic contrast from the buildip. Also the mix has a few holes where effects or something can be added when an instrument ends it's phrasing.
