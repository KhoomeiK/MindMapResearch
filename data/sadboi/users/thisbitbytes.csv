todayilearned,fa93n8x,t3_e81x3k,1575861575.0,Over a decade ago I once excitedly tore my bra off at a piano bar when ladies were invited to celebrate this way at midnight every Sat night.  All was great until I remembered that this was my first night out after having a 3 month old baby and my tolerance wasn’t what it once was.  Pulling nursing pads out of your bra and screaming “I juss had a bay beee” is less cute than it sounds.  I hope they didn’t donate that bra.
