One day, I think I was 3 or 4, I was being a little shit and jumping on the benches at the restaurant we were at. She told me to stop and i just gave her that little shit-eating grin kids give. She whisked me off of the bench and into the bathroom which had several stalls. She dotted the wall with her lipstick and made me put my nose against it in the corner of the bathroom while she sat on a toilet with the door open, reading. Every time someone came in the bathroom, they saw me. I was mortified. To top it off, if anyone said anything to me, my only response was “I was a bad girl and bad girls have to stand in the corner,” and I was allowed to say what I did wrong. When I was done with time-out I got to keep the lipstick on my nose as a reminder. Straightened me out pretty good. 

My mom also used to say I wasn’t allowed to come out of the corner until I said what I did wrong, and agreed to be better behaved. I hated that part because I didn’t want to have to talk about it after."

Eventually, I was able to get out. 

It’s been almost 3 years of no contact after a 2.5+ year relationship and I’m still not whole. I’m still not the person I was. I will never be her again. After seeing someone become what he was and do what he did, I can’t ever be fully vulnerable again. 

It does get better. It continues to. I hear his voice less. I don’t have nightmares as often, and I’m able to do most things he stole from me again.  But I know, just as his ex’s told me they have, the PTSD doesn’t leave. It won’t. I will always have some part of him lingering to haunt me."

Imagine being there and your choice is to die from jumping from 100 stories, burn to death, or be crushed in the downfall of the buildings. I can’t even imagine. 

Also the plane hits and the smoke and rubble. Those poor people on that plane just fearfully flying into a building. That has got to be the worst fear in the whole world. I grew up 3 hours from NYC and I was so scared every time I heard a plane for DAYS. I used to wonder if the planes that crashed flew above my town. Did those people know they were going to die when they were above me? Were they calling their families and saying goodbye? The other thing was the absolute silence in the air for days after. No planes. Complete silence. So strange. Still, almost 2 decades later, I’m aware of most planes that fly above me, like I’ll never forget how quiet those days were."

He still lives at home, still has no job, but takes college classes here and there. Mostly online because he “can’t handle” a classroom. While I’m aware that the kid is surely fucked up, he’s mentally probably at least 16+ and is competent to do so much more than my mother allows. It’s a huge arguing point between my mother and I because she doesn’t want to hear it, like I didn’t live with him for 14 years.

I grew up about 3 hours from NYC, and my mom was on vacation in Florida helping settle her dying grandmother’s estate. She was due to come home the next day on a plane, and wound up traveling home on a bus about a week past her original arrival date. 

We all left school early and the papers put out the only “Extra” I’ve seen in my life. The whole town was silent, somber, deafeningly so. We waited hours to hear from a family friend who had just finished working in the North Tower days before. The most agonizing wait I’ve ever experienced, aside from waiting for my mom to get home. Luckily, both were safe. Also, the first (and only) time I ever saw my (step)father cry.

Days after the event, you could see faintly over the mountains of our town, clouds that I still swear to this day were clouds of debris and dust that migrated. I don’t even think it could be from 237 miles away, but who knows.

This thread is both really touching and shocking to me. I knew what a colossal event this was for my childhood and the generations to come, the “Kennedy Assassination” of our time, but I’ve never realized how influential it truly was for the world. Maybe that’s part of my self-centered nature as an American. I remember realizing at that time that not only did I see history, I saw war. I remember the only times I’ve watched the news religiously, seeing Bush launch the first bombs and being terrified of what that meant for me and my future."
