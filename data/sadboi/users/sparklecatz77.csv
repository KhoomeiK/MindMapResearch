I live in a forested neighborhood with lots of deer, and one night I woke up because my window was open and I heard this blood-chilling half-human sounding scream over and over and eventually I figured out deer can scream really loud and it sounds very very creepy and a lot like a person if you don't know what it is. They can also run very fast and leap over fences depending on the height, which may explain how it got up and down the road so fast? Sometimes deer behave really strangely if they're sick or injured, which would explain the repetitiveness of the screaming?"

SuicideWatch,ewahls0,t3_cnc99a,1565243860.0,"I'm no expert on overdoses, but I have had my fair share of brain injuries. Being in a near death state like that definitely wouldn't be good for your brain especially if you lost conciousness, but there's also other reasons why it might be happening. Extreme depression can actually cause memory loss in some cases, or if you dissociate due to the depression that could also cause it. If it is due to brain damage, in my experience (lost a whole summer and had to relearn basic math), it would almost definitely be significant enough brain damage to cause other symptoms as well. Stuff like light and noise sensitivity, insane headaches, etc the kind of stuff you would see with a concussion and most or all of those extra symptoms would go away after a while most likely but the memories would probably not return. For example, when I had brain damage that gave me all that amnesia I also was extremely sensitive to light and noise, completely nauseous, had insane headaches, and couldn't talk or walk right for a little while. Every case is different, but that's just an example of some brain damage symptoms. I wish the best of luck to you."

I think that the way we perceive everything in the whole wide world is all directly mirroring what goes on inside your head, and that reality itself differs depending on where you're viewing it from.. I think that if you see meaning, there is meaning, and if you don't see meaning, it simply means you feel meaningless. The bright side of this is that one day, you might wake up and every little thing will be beautiful again; that hope is what keeps me going when everything gets so dull."

A bunch of kind strangers gave me a variety of psychedelics throughout the night, and I was on lsd, mushrooms, mdma, ketamine, and salvia all at once. I have never seen so many colors or seen the night sky look like that ever before in my life. I also had never met so many amazing people before, every single person there was so nice and amazing. It was also very bonding for my boyfriend and I, and made us realize even more how amazing our relationship is. It was beautiful and we danced all night before some really nice people on mushrooms brought out guitars and sang me into a trance that lasted the rest of the night, I don't know if my eyes were open or closed because there were so many visuals. By the time I was out of the trance, it was light outside and I took more mushrooms and danced the whole way home (I wasn't the driver). My faith in humanity has been entirely restored, and I feel so full of love and joy and so excited for the rest of my life."

I would tell you to go to a hospital where they can help, but I know how it feels to not want to miss any class. The best thing I can tell you is that usually colleges have counsellors on staff, and if you can get in with one of them they can keep everything confidential and make sure you are able to get help without a negative impact on school. If anyone can make that possible, a college counselor can. Balancing mental health with college courses is literally what they spend their whole lives helping people with. Good luck <3"

AskWomen,ep9l5e5,t3_btv08c,1559111861.0,"I used to have really severe anxiety. My boyfriend is incredibly calm-headed, and over the years has helped me see that most things aren't that big a deal and won't matter once a little time has passed all that would matter is the fun memories I have and things I have learned. One of the biggest things is that I try to never turn down a challenge because I love to win or just to play games, and I realized anxiety was a challenge so I basically just decided to approach life with a ""challenge accepted"" attitude and accomplish all the things I'm scared of  just to dance all over the anxiety's grave once it's all been said and done. After a few years of this, I went from over 3 panic attacks a day to rarely getting enough anxiety to debilitate me in any way. The ""challenge accepted mwahahaha you can't defeat me anxiety and even if I have a minor fuck up I still win"" attitude has really changed my life and made it much more fun."

AskWomen,ep9i62k,t3_bu1ap9,1559110479.0,"Waiting until you are emotionally ready and find the right person. By emotionally ready, I mean even if the person leaves you the very next day (if ya got the right person this is unlikely anyway), you would be no worse off emotionally for having given your virginity them. I'm a bit old fashioned, but in my opinion it should only be done with someone who you feel comfortable talking to about sex and it being your first time and how you feel in every way. With those factors met, you go into the situation knowing you won't regret it and that relieves a lot of nerves. If you trust the person a lot, that should really help with nerves as you are comfortable and not worried about being judged. Do some research as to what to expect when losing your virginity, and do it in the right mindset and setting. For example, if a loved one just died or you are in a house with paper thin walls and parents in the next room this does not spell out the best experience. Also, researching sex positions is a good crash course on the ""how to"" of sex. Never feel like you need to act like a porn star, as most guys find screaming volume moans and random ass slapping kind of off-putting haha, just be you and feel the sensations and let what happens happen :))) Before my first time, I got super clean and fancy and scented so if you like to pamper yourself then go wild and do what it takes to feel good, confident, and comfy in your own skin. Walk in with almost no expectations, and let the moment and passion lead itself wherever it may take you. Good luck!"

AskWomen,ep9arcg,t3_bu34hg,1559107030.0,"Spreading conditioner over my skin before shaving. Thought it was weird till I tried it, but the difference is magical and my skin is so soft after. Also using argan oil as a leave-in conditioner instead of using a conditioner in the shower, which weighs my hair down and makes it look flat. Argan oil replaces brushing my hair for me too, it makes it so soft smooth and slippery that it's like it forgets how to tangle. I also hate the cakey residue of most foundations, so I mix liquid concealer with primer as foundation which also helps ensure the conditioner is the same color as the foundation and keeps my skin soft and smooth. Oh, and this one is not good for your skin but if you need temporary really thorough concealer especially on acne dab a bit of diluted  toothpaste on it before applying concealer and it will be entirely opaque, it will also make the acne go down. Learning to thread your own eyebrows too ensures they are always perfect, and outlining your lips and eyebrows makes them more defined. Also if your dark circles under your eyes cast a hint of a shadow when lit from above, put concealer one shade lighter exactly where the shadow falls and it will be unidentifiable."

My friends were way too dramatic and mean and have since fallen away, but that's okay because they introduced me to the man of my dreams and I learned a lot about how not to treat others.
