I would go through with them what it was that was causing concern, exhaustion, etc. Sometimes finding the right ways to truly care for yourself can be a difficult but important part of finding yourself as a counselor. Ultimately, what is important is how to do self care well and continue to treat clients well. That could be any number of things: setting boundaries, re-prioritizing scheduled activities, finding out what your “things” are that help you center and truly relax...and if all else fails, it is also important to have clear conversations about what is or is not a good fit and reassess if need be. Duties, role, or even work environment and expectations aren’t always a good fit. Helping the supervisee find their best fit and potential while maintaining client care is key.

Courts always default to 50/50: unless there is too much in a situation that would definitely potentially harm a bond already established with the family or other resources.

I would advise, (if you haven’t already) clarifying with your partner what the exact goals are for you and your family and how to best move forward in a way you feel safest and can navigate realistically. (No pressure, right?)

Example: I am essential, so while I can work remotely now, that could change anytime my employer decides I should be in the office physically. I’ve decided that this is not the safest choice for my family and my partner agrees. So we have decided that both of us will actively work to establish a long-term remote work schedule. This is an anxiety-provoking pain in the ass. BUT it is better than us being concerned about the health and well being of ourselves and our kids as long as there is no vaccine. 

Tldr: decide with your partner what is and isn’t in your control and what you feel comfortable with. Make decisions and plans based on needs for health concerns and child care/educational needs. It’s really a personal thing that, when both or multiple parents are involved, needs to be very clear about. Then figure out what is an option/within your control based on the decision you and your partner are on the same page about. Every family’s needs are different.

It may be to your family’s advantage to have this kind of discussion with your partner: what your expectations are; what hers are; what you both expect out of working and navigating your child. What options are there you are both able to navigate.

I wish I could have enough altruism to believe that he is trying to do his best weighing the science and other concerns here: but he definitely began to shift his 2 pm talks after these started, and the President was openly calling for other states to “liberate!” I don’t see these things as a coincidence, and it is concerning to me. DeWine is seen as this great champion. In another view, he looks like a politician who had to make a statement against an antisemite only after one of his colleagues got in big, public, trouble on the Internet.

My entire family was like this when I was a kid: all the women are raised to “not rock the boat.” I have two girls that are still in single-digits. I made a very concerted effort to help nurture their assertiveness in them, and it seems to be working out. They (hopefully) feel empowered to question and think for themselves as much as possible and I know that my oldest at least has no problem whatsoever correcting a teacher who accidentally slips up wording something or information wise.

NarcAbuseAndDivorce,folhopx,t3_g83bmp,1587862454.0,"Joint custody is the default in almost every state. Therefore, he cannot legally keep the kids from you without your consent if you have a shared parenting order. 

In my experience, if you try and fight shared parenting in any way, the family court system will vilify you for your ex spouse. It is *extremely* frowned upon to attempt and obtain more than 50/50 custody without father’s agreement, and the court system is overcompensating from years of alienating fathers by working actively for abusers by ensuring that they have rights. An extreme example of this is when rapists fight and win for parental rights of their children that are products of rape. I live in a state where this is an occurrence that happens. 

But I digress. Get a counselor who knows about domestic abuse. I could not agree more with the advice to do this and stick to facts. An attorney will not care about abuse, and it almost certainly will not effect custody splits to talk about it. In fact, it will make you appear to be attempting to “alienate the father” or do “parental alienation:” which is not at all a real thing. But the court system thinks that it is, so that’s all that matters. It seriously has no real science behind it, but is the default of every GAL, attorney, magistrate, and judge in the domestic courts. 

Nobody in the court system wants to hear about abuse, and at the billable hours being charged every time you talk to your attorney, you could be talking to a clinician instead who can help you process the abuse. 

Also, if you want to know how to benefit the most, I would advise asking for right of first refusal, asking to be residential parent for school purposes, familiarize yourself with the shared parenting schedules for your state, and examine what is to your advantage now and in the future. Would it benefit you to ask for a different holiday schedule than the default local rule for your state? Ask for it. 

Child support is not calculated based on parental time in most states. So don’t back down on having that calculated through your state’s child support system. NEVER agree to support on the good word of someone you used to love in divorce court. 

Oh, and if he doesn’t like what you ask for if all you’re doing is mediation, then if he escalates it to pretrials, that makes him look bad because it sets you up as someone trying to make amends and be a good parent and he’s gumming up the courts for his own reasons. This annoys magistrates. 

Tl;dr: never ask for more than 50/50 or the courts will eat you alive unless he’s already agreeing to it; get a counselor; know what to ask for in the final shared parenting plan and divorce decree; always go through the child support enforcement agency, or there’s no way he’s going to pay and there aren’t going to be any consequences for him if he doesn’t.

Also, with rain and dark, bleak, weather. I do like sun and warmth here and there, but not constantly. 

That’s not to say that I’m not an outlier, and I’ve never been to a country where the winters are like what Finnish winters are. But I would love to find out. I’d take snow and ice and severe cold over never having weather like that. Truly, snow and cold are peaceful and energizing. I hope to one day find out if I can hack it in a Finnish winter. One of my cousins and I who share that part of my family plan to go there one day, (we will see now,) and I told him we should go in winter.

One doesn’t look like the other, you say? No, he just says what he needs to to push his party forward. This is a clean up act. It is bare minimum. And it is noted and a shame that he had to have someone ask directly without first condemning that and the Confederate flags and white supremacy groups that have also been around the Statehouse, leaving flyers and wearing propaganda. This has been going on before the anti-Semitic sign, and he chose to ignore it. He chose to ignore the sign for days until someone else got called out for his direct (and completely awful and wrong) comparison to Ohio as Nazi Germany on Facebook. 

DeWine gets props for doing well overall with coronavirus *so far*. But this isn’t a shining moment. This is a cleanup to deflect from a mess someone else in his party created publicly. It opportunistic. 

Is it good he decried the sign? Yes...but he didn’t do so until...four days later, after a colleague was publicly called out for nasty comments on Holocaust Remembrance Day.

This man is doing what’s best for him and his party only when he had to. He’s not in any way condemning anything. He’s doing the bare minimum, and only after someone else prompted him to make a very clear statement.

Psychiatry,fo6vrfo,t3_g5zu0v,1587567639.0,"“Too Scared to Cry” by Lenore Terr and “Father Daughter Incest” by Judith Lewis Herman are also older but good reading as far as having an insight into early, historical makings of how the field develops an understanding of early trauma. Both authors were key in the development of PTSD as a diagnosis, and the context of say, an adult patient who has suffered trauma. When someone sees sexual abuse in a chart, Lewis-Herman’s book can give insight into how that trauma can be compounded, as a number of diagnoses are linked to early childhood incestuous abuse. 

Also cannot recommend “The Body Keeps the Score” enough to assist with an understanding of trauma presentation."
relationship_advice,fo3q1zk,t3_g5ep1b,1587491081.0,"I think if you know you are neglecting your child, you need to do what will keep her safe.

Look, neglect is not far from outright abuse. Neglect can be a wide variety of things, but make no mistake, these things negatively effect the growing, developing, human brain. And not for the better. 

I’m curious as to what has already occurred to where the grandparents have had to intervene. 

OP, I would suggest that, depending on where you are, you call the children’s services in your area and explain to them what you’ve just told us. We can’t help you. Neglect is very serious, and it may be in your daughter’s best interest to be somewhere else.

2. The reason I mentioned abortion is because the other poster I was speaking to very flippantly stated people should choose not to have children if they have a mental illness. That’s ridiculous for two major reasons: one, it is assuming people can make that decision. (Women largely cannot once they’re already pregnant in the United States). Secondly, the idea of not producing children is the hallmark of eugenics. 

3. Margaret Sanger was a racist. Planned Parenthood today has nothing to do with her initial ideology. Just like people still idealize and use the products, quotes, and knowledge of people like Winston Churchill, Francis Galton, Helen Keller, Theodore Roosevelt, and Alexander Graham Bell, who were all also very publicly eugenicists. 

4. I actually have one of my degrees in psychology, so sorry that this is so inflammatory in regards to the word “abortion” to you specifically, but this is just a tip of the ice berg in regards to what you’re upset about. My main point wasn’t at all about abortion. It was noting the privileged and misinformed view of the person I was replying to. I am very well aware of eugenics, the history of it, and psychology."

Also doesn’t account at all for the lack of accessing abortion services, the systemic lack of options for many of the exact people you’re speaking about. 

I’m here to point out the subtle but obvious prejudice and incorrect information you’re attempting to pass off as valid. It is not valid. 

And again-*there is what appears to be heritability for mental illness.* there is in no way an inference in that that alludes that people with mental illness shouldn’t have children. 

That’s a leap of prejudice and blatant bad science to attempt and make a case that would have long ago cut our population in half if not more."
