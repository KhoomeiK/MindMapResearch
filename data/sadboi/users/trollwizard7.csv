keto,fbewy01,t1_fbepnqp,1576795914.0,"Yeah I get what you're saying.  It said people who take these meds and go on keto need closer monitoring because keto can mess with the levels of the drug in your system.  It stated specifically Abilify and Seroquel are ones that would need closer monitoring to make sure it isn't messing up the effectiveness of the drug in your system.  IDK how much I should trust these articles I'm reading online, so I guess I'll just have to ask my psych when I see him in a few weeks."

ehlersdanlos,fapc0r5,t3_ea7o9m,1576285144.0,"My body didn't handle pregnancy very well either time.  I didn't know at the time I had hEDS.  My children both tried to come early - I was put on bedrest with each pregnancy.  My first was one day late, my second was two weeks early.  My labors were both pretty easy.  My first lasted a long time, my second lasted three hours.  I have lasting hip issues from the pregnancies, but to me, it was worth it.  My children are each showing signs of hEDS though (my son is showing signs of EDS because he has stretchy skin, so my husband must be a carrier of the classical EDS gene or I am misdiagnosed)."
BipolarReddit,falgzkl,t1_falgf8c,1576184206.0,"Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.  Maybe I can stay on the seroquel and have it help with mania and depression.  I haven't been on AP's for too long - just a year at this point so I'm surprised I developed TD but I guess it can happen this early and since I am on two AP's.  Thanks for the response.  I hope your movement disorder has gone away."
BipolarReddit,faii8yq,t1_faii4j0,1576108466.0,that makes sense to me.  I'm sorry you went through that.  It seems abilify causes this problem for quite a few people.  It sucks because it has helped me but I really don't want to have TD for the rest of my life.
BipolarReddit,fai94p5,t1_fai83bh,1576102457.0,"Very interesting, thank you for sharing your story.  I'm sorry you had to go through that and I'm sad to hear getting off abilify was difficult for you.  I've gone through my share of drug withdrawals thanks to trial and error of meds for my bipolar, so I'm not looking forward to doing that again.  Hopefully lowering the dose will stop the TD."

IDK if that's related or not, but that started after I started seroquel.  Can akathisia just be twitching in the fingers and eyebrows and such?"
BipolarReddit,f9voul0,t1_f9vos5j,1575675821.0,Ok thanks!  Did your pdoc say it was just a normal side effect of seroquel?

You'll get through this and once you find the right med combo, you'll feel better.  It does get better."
