I‚Äôve seen other people answer this question and say it makes you unsure of feeling full, or something like that. Like it switches something off in your brain, but idk. 

But I mean, after that initial weight gain I‚Äôve been able to remain the same weight, losing it seems to be difficult for me. As long as I‚Äôm not continually gaining I‚Äôm cool haha"

I think what it did for me was switch my mind onto the physical pain (I gave myself headaches) and forgot a lot when I was in those moods, like I couldn‚Äôt remember what I or anyone previously said to me in a moment, and when I hit myself, I forgot everything and didn‚Äôt feel, it was like turned off.

I would say it‚Äôs normal, it‚Äôs a really hard thing to fix like almost impossible haha. If you have pain use heat to relax the muscles in your face and jaw, massage it, etc. When it‚Äôs bad don‚Äôt chew gum, hard food. (Look up tmj remedies) It‚Äôs usually from stress triggers but not sure why lexapro worsens it.

I‚Äôve also had headaches in the temple and facial pain when my jaw doesn‚Äôt hurt, I think it‚Äôs just a build up of the muscles and joint creating pain. I don‚Äôt have a scientific explanation but I feel you! What helps me is heating/wheat bags you can heat in the microwave, and those soft gel ice packs. I also massage my fingers like I said into my temples and jaw joints, and I‚Äôve recently been using this cream: [Gardeners Dream Cream](https://www.amazon.ca/Aroma-Crystal-Therapy-Gardeners-Dream/dp/B005HIUFE6) it‚Äôs amazing for headaches and jaw pain, shoulder and neck pain, literally anywhere you hurt just rub it on and it helps.
