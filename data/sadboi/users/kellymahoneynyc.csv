You see the best and worst of people when they’re getting on a plane. It really helped me learn to not take things personal, and to treat everyone with respect and kindness- because you never know what they’ve gone through before they’re on that plane. Obviously, there are exceptions.

As difficult as it is, I take a shower at least every other day and wash my hair at least once every 3 days. I plan my days- chunk my time into attainable tasks so I feel like I’ve accomplished something, even if it’s just making the bed. I could go on forever- but you get the idea.

Finding the right therapist is really important. It’s like dating- you meet a lot of frogs before you get the prince. Medication regulation is a bitch and can take a while before you find something that works. Be patient. It gets better. It really does. Trust me."

socialwork,f5slyyy,t1_f5siiki,1572436163.0,"THIS. The non profit agency I work for is a damn mess right now. I trained myself, basically. I created a training manual for my department as I was training because I’ll be damned if I’m going to let someone else come in the way I did. Like I tell my clients, baby steps. 

95% of our job is documentation. If the agency says things like ‘we don’t need to write that down, we are having face to face discussions about what we do here’ RUN. Just run. If it’s not written down, it didn’t happen.

Semi related anecdote/mostly rant: I offered to go with a CM to a homeless shelter to meet a male client because 1) She didn’t have a HIPPA and having a supervisor badge is magic apparently 2) She wasn’t comfortable going alone to meet this person for the first time. A director from another department told me not to go and that she didn’t understand why I was going in the field with them. I told her because my management style was different from hers and I prefer to be more hands on, and that I appreciated her advice but I was going to accompany her, and if she has issue with it she can take it up with my director. 

I’m at a point now where I can say ‘no’ to things or counter with a different opinion without being afraid of getting fired- don’t work for a place that makes you fear speaking up. They aren’t focused on progress and positive change, they are focused on control. 

After writing all of this out... I should be looking for a new job. My entire agency is one bulk order of red flags."

Honestly, having a pulse is a requirement for most places. There is training available, and a lot of it you learn as you go.

Combine stock, rice, half of the mushrooms (quartered or sliced, whatever you prefer), carrots, onions, thyme, bay leaves. Let it boil until the carrots are almost soft, then bring it to a simmer.

While your stuff is boiling, mince or throw the remaining mushrooms in a food processor. When you’re simmering, add the mushrooms and the celery.
