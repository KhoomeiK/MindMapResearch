Don‚Äôt do it. Try something else, you are in no way obligated to go to a gym and weight lift. Your husband probably wants to get in shape and spend time with you, which is wonderful, but if you‚Äôre dreading going there is absolutely no reason to. Exercise is and can be free. I loved lifting for years, then one day, I woke up and hated it, so I quit doing it for like 2 years straight. Then picked it up again and liked it again. Does your gym offer any classes that look fun? Try yoga, or hot yoga, or a cycling class, or Pilates, or just going on walks, or a coed sports team maybe with your husband and some friends (volleyball? Kickball? Those can be tons of fun.) Moving your body is all you need to do, and while this whole health craze is great getting people to start taking care of themselves more, everyone and anyone who has worked out for 6 months and got in slightly better shape is suddenly running around acting like they know everything and that everyone needs to lift weights or run or whatever and it‚Äôs just not true.

PaleMUA,fbfs4hn,t3_ecxmy5,1576819154.0,"I really like Maybelline‚Äôs ‚Äúeyestudio brow define + fill duo‚Äù that has a gel pencil on one side and a powder sponge on the other. You can either just use the powder for a daily type look, or use both if you‚Äôre doing a heavier makeup look. Plus it‚Äôs only $5-6 depending on where you get it, and it‚Äôs usually at most drugstores and target"
skyrim,fbfqpil,t1_fbfpv83,1576817837.0,Yes this!
skyrim,fbfqfz1,t1_fbfbw45,1576817594.0,"Yes, that is EXACTLY what happened! Plus I‚Äôm still pretty low level, so it didn‚Äôt take long

Plus I‚Äôm actually still confused to why there was a random thalmor soldier in the ragged flagon, but whatever"
skyrim,fbf51s3,t3_ecyg4q,1576801741.0,"I‚Äôm playing the game over, and I got to the ragged flagon today. Brynjolf was asking me to collect the debts and in the middle of the conversation a Thalmor soldier COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND STABS ME DEAD. MID CONVERSATION. And then has the audacity to say ‚Äúhmmmmm must‚Äôve scared em off!‚Äù At least I auto-saved right before it, but still..."

KingOfTheHill,fbd0irx,t1_fbcyeue,1576740969.0,"Huh that‚Äôs interesting! I think it would be cool to see a lot of those old ‚Äútraining‚Äù documents or pamphlets from the military, especially knowing now how accurate or inaccurate the things they taught were"
KingOfTheHill,fbcwwpk,t1_fbbcv1g,1576736750.0,"Cotton‚Äôs character in the earlier seasons was probably one of my favorite cartoon characters of all time. They successfully created the exaggerated war veteran persona to make fun of, but still acknowledged what someone may have learned from those experiences. I have older family members who were in WW2 (only one alive now), and it was obviously an exaggerated character but still so accurate. The knowledge and respect of different cultures, yet the apprehensiveness and occasionally racism against a certain type of people because they were the ones who were always trying to kill you. They really portrayed a lot about a complicated type of character for being just a cartoon"
Chihuahua,fbct8ph,t3_ecmdzv,1576733097.0,Mine does this too! She does it *vigorously* when she knows you‚Äôre about to feed her lol
antiMLM,fb9wsl5,t1_fb9i8ng,1576653056.0,"I have found that *generally* (not always because some people don‚Äôt care about social media much, but usually huns do care) people who say ‚Äústudied at college/university‚Äù never got a degree, where as people who did, their profile will say ‚Äúgraduated in 2010 from college/university‚Äù"

LuLaNo,fb9uyat,t1_fb9tm3n,1576650877.0,"See I‚Äôm not even gonna complain because that‚Äôs a completely appropriate price for what it is. Still ugly as hell in my opinion, but at least more appropriately priced"
antiMLM,fb9ooq8,t1_fb8qx7b,1576644561.0,"That might be something else, because the tube I got said ‚Äúcoochie cream, pure romance‚Äù and that was it. What I think it basically is though is a cheap hair conditioner, which I shave with anyway instead of using true shaving cream, and that helps me with razor burn. Except cheap hair conditioner is a couple dollar for a large container, not $25 for a small tube that takes 5 weeks to deliver"
relationships,fb8g6ct,t1_fb83oxz,1576613206.0,"Also, if it‚Äôs a relatively new relationship (as in OP met her a few months ago), girlfriend could be reacting very clearly to make her boundaries known early on in the relationship. If so, good for her. ‚ÄúNo, you can not make suggestive comments about other women with your friends in front of me. No, you can not watch tons of porn (a certain type of porn, porn at all? Context unclear). No, you cannot drink to excess and act like an ass in public when we are together.‚Äù Nothing red flag here to me"
relationships,fb8fsqr,t1_fb7q3l4,1576612962.0,"I thought the exact same thing. It sounds like an exaggerated take on very normal reactions from the girl who isn‚Äôt interested in seeming ‚Äúcool‚Äù at all costs. As soon as a girl sets boundaries and doesn‚Äôt bend over backwards to be liked, she‚Äôs seen as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù by groups of immature guys. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôm reading too much into this, but it sounds like a tale as old as time"
antiMLM,fb8erug,t1_fb88bxa,1576612330.0,I was suckered into buying this godforsaken coochie cream once. I will literally never miss a chance to tell anyone how GOD AWFUL it was. Awful. Smells weird. And $25.
