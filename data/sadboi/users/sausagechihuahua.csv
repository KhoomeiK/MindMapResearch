They did, however, watch and love Gulla Gulla Island, which I’m sure many of you know features a black family.

So, cousin’s family makes a trip into the city, and sits down at a restaurant. A black family sits near them, and of *course* it must be the people from Gulla Gulla Island! They said Gulla Gulla!!!! Gulla Gulla!!!” And pointed obviously at the family. My cousin’s parents were mortified."

AskReddit,fdd3q6b,t1_fdco9gv,1578293525.0,"Honestly - this is coming from a woman who weight lifted 5x per week for like 3 years straight, and whose husband competes in bodybuilding for fun.. if you don’t like it after a week, it’s not for you. Don’t do it. Try something else, you are in no way obligated to go to a gym and weight lift. Your husband probably wants to get in shape and spend time with you, which is wonderful, but if you’re dreading going there is absolutely no reason to. Exercise is and can be free. I loved lifting for years, then one day, I woke up and hated it, so I quit doing it for like 2 years straight. Then picked it up again and liked it again. Does your gym offer any classes that look fun? Try yoga, or hot yoga, or a cycling class, or Pilates, or just going on walks, or a coed sports team maybe with your husband and some friends (volleyball? Kickball? Those can be tons of fun.) Moving your body is all you need to do, and while this whole health craze is great getting people to start taking care of themselves more, everyone and anyone who has worked out for 6 months and got in slightly better shape is suddenly running around acting like they know everything and that everyone needs to lift weights or run or whatever and it’s just not true.

In my job, I don’t have to be quick moving, so I choose the latter. But I can see why a woman that has to be quick (looks like she is in the police force?) would pick the tighter uniform.

Most people don’t usually refer to late teenagers as “children,” though, because they really aren’t the same as say a ten year old, so we say teenager to be more specific and clarify that they are closer to being full grown than a ten year old, but still not fully grown. If that 15 year old kid has a full beard and deep voice, his *brain* is still only 15 years old, so he has a good ten years left before his brain is fully developed. His teacher was well aware of how old he was because she was his teacher, and because she was a pedophile, she coerced him into a sexual relationship. Will the kid be “okay”? Yeah, probably, and I hope so. Every human goes through some sort of abuse from another during their lives, that varies in severity of course. That doesn’t make that use okay.

And then has the audacity to say “hmmmmm must’ve scared em off!” At least I auto-saved right before it, but still..."
BelgianMalinois,fbf4qym,t3_ed0ve5,1576801523.0,I have to use a toy or a treat to keep mine still lol
KingOfTheHill,fbd0irx,t1_fbcyeue,1576740969.0,"Huh that’s interesting! I think it would be cool to see a lot of those old “training” documents or pamphlets from the military, especially knowing now how accurate or inaccurate the things they taught were"
KingOfTheHill,fbcwwpk,t1_fbbcv1g,1576736750.0,"Cotton’s character in the earlier seasons was probably one of my favorite cartoon characters of all time. They successfully created the exaggerated war veteran persona to make fun of, but still acknowledged what someone may have learned from those experiences. I have older family members who were in WW2 (only one alive now), and it was obviously an exaggerated character but still so accurate. The knowledge and respect of different cultures, yet the apprehensiveness and occasionally racism against a certain type of people because they were the ones who were always trying to kill you. They really portrayed a lot about a complicated type of character for being just a cartoon"
Chihuahua,fbct8ph,t3_ecmdzv,1576733097.0,Mine does this too! She does it *vigorously* when she knows you’re about to feed her lol
antiMLM,fb9wsl5,t1_fb9i8ng,1576653056.0,"I have found that *generally* (not always because some people don’t care about social media much, but usually huns do care) people who say “studied at college/university” never got a degree, where as people who did, their profile will say “graduated in 2010 from college/university”"
antiMLM,fb9wnnq,t1_fb9vnd2,1576652888.0,Cyanide is also a “naturally” occurring substance lol
LuLaNo,fb9uyat,t1_fb9tm3n,1576650877.0,"See I’m not even gonna complain because that’s a completely appropriate price for what it is. Still ugly as hell in my opinion, but at least more appropriately priced"
antiMLM,fb9ooq8,t1_fb8qx7b,1576644561.0,"That might be something else, because the tube I got said “coochie cream, pure romance” and that was it. What I think it basically is though is a cheap hair conditioner, which I shave with anyway instead of using true shaving cream, and that helps me with razor burn. Except cheap hair conditioner is a couple dollar for a large container, not $25 for a small tube that takes 5 weeks to deliver"
relationships,fb8g6ct,t1_fb83oxz,1576613206.0,"Also, if it’s a relatively new relationship (as in OP met her a few months ago), girlfriend could be reacting very clearly to make her boundaries known early on in the relationship. If so, good for her. “No, you can not make suggestive comments about other women with your friends in front of me. No, you can not watch tons of porn (a certain type of porn, porn at all? Context unclear). No, you cannot drink to excess and act like an ass in public when we are together.” Nothing red flag here to me"
relationships,fb8fsqr,t1_fb7q3l4,1576612962.0,"I thought the exact same thing. It sounds like an exaggerated take on very normal reactions from the girl who isn’t interested in seeming “cool” at all costs. As soon as a girl sets boundaries and doesn’t bend over backwards to be liked, she’s seen as “crazy” by groups of immature guys. I’m hoping I’m reading too much into this, but it sounds like a tale as old as time"
antiMLM,fb8erug,t1_fb88bxa,1576612330.0,I was suckered into buying this godforsaken coochie cream once. I will literally never miss a chance to tell anyone how GOD AWFUL it was. Awful. Smells weird. And $25.
