My mom was making a joke of it, but my dad and I were very serious into the screening. It was so amazing to see how such a wonderful man could continue to treat everyone the same exact way, whether they were lowlifers, depressed, down-syndrome, autistic, any of those traits he didn’t care about one bit. He would always say that he likes you for who you are on the inside, and those traits are only what people see on the outside. 

It touched me how innocent he was even in his old age. Always happy, and sometimes would get upset, but found healthy ways like swimming and playing the piano. Beautiful story and made me cry, a lot, like very much, but I woke up the next day knowing that Mr. Rogers wouldn’t want me to do such a sad thing, and he wants me to live and be who I am on the inside, not the outside."

I was and have been bullied as a teen. Throughout High School I’ve had my ups and downs of going through depressive episodes, due to the death of my close pet and the loss of my ex-girlfriend.

One day, I was in the bathroom after I got a pass from a teacher when a junior kid came in with two other guys. At first, they just went to piss and make sure their hair was fine. Then, one of them walked up to me and put his hand on my shoulder. He asked me what my name was, and why I was on this side of the building (there was a freshman center on the opposite side of the building and I was on the 10-12 portion for an advanced class). I didn’t say my name, but told them I was there for an honors biology course. Then, each of the 3 boys began subtitly cornering me to the edge of the bathroom, asking me what I thought ‘seniors’ did to freshman like me, basically wanting a fight. I told them all to fuck off, then one of them pulled out a pocket knife and held it up to the mid-temple of my chest. At that point I had assumed they were a part of some gang, because I wasn’t living in a good district and it was a racially mixed school. It turns out, after I dealt with the cops and the principle, that the kids had recent gang activity inside/outside of school. 

I tried to run out of the bathroom, yelling for help, but the 3 of them yanked me back again, and one of the kids lifted up my shirt while using the other arm to hold me against the wall. The kid that had the knife drug it acrossed the right portion of my chest, slowly and harshly. *It felt like a really bad paper cut.*

I started bleeding profusely and fell on the floor, and they told me if I said shit that they would kill me next time. I started crying, and didn’t know what to do. I cleaned up the blood the best I could until someone cleaned it up, then immediately ran to the office to tell someone what happened. I was sobbing and having a panic attack at the same time, so it was not easy for me to tell the staff what had happened. I didn’t know their names, all I knew was they were all of black race and wore a lot of red. They took it from there and eventually got the justice I needed.

I hope that answers your question average Joe green. Please..be more thoughtful next time."
