If I dare to even expose my mental difficulties by an inch while pretending that my social life isn't worthless, I get left behind and forgotten as though I never meant anything to that person. That's why the whole ""I'm friendly to everyone"" hypocritical nonsense gets on my nerves, and I hate myself for falling for it so easily."

It may be a terrifying outcome to you, or it may contain something you seek. If fear is the outcome of seeing where permanent anger can get you, then that would be a foundation of reverting back towards more positive outlooks. The choice is yours."

The future is unknown, full of suprises. Rather than assuming the numerous outcomes, one should accept that there are many challenges and opprtunities to arise from the future's unpredictability. There are only so many things we can think at one point in time. Patience is key."

If you try harder than you need to, you'll despair even more. Just keep moving. No one can promise you better relationships that possibly await you elsewhere, but it's better than trying to work with something that will only drain you. Despite what I say, however, it's your choice to make."
