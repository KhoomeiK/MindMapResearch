Not the same, I know, but I once dated a gentleman who was deaf and could not speak. I didn't know ASL, so we communicated primarily through text messaging, even while in each other's company. Things are good, we go for a walk one time, and then on a second date, we go go to a bar to play pool. I let him know right off the hop, I would like to be home by 10pm at the latest, as I have to be to work early the next day. Fine and well.

We decide to get a coffee when we are done pool, and I realize the time and try to politely excuse myself. He gets weirdly pushy, and insists on buying a half case and going back to my place to drink and watch tv. I say no, and reiterate that I have to work early. He insists. 3 more times. I say no 3 more times. I finally bounce and go grab a cab. He never texts me again, I never text him again. My co worker asked me what happened, and asks if maybe there was a misunderstanding. I show her texts and she realizes there wasn't.

She lamely suggests that maybe he's socially inept because he's deaf? I fire back with ""being deaf doesn't make you exempt from being an asshole. And the first 'no' should've been enough."".

I'm not here to condemn you or him, and I'm not going to immediately scream ""divorce"", but I would be asking myself some questions. 

Why was calling his parents such a priority on xmas? Why couldn't he wait until everyone had presents and breakfast? Do you think that shit would've flown if the situation was reversed and it had been your parents?

Why is he trying so hard to separate you from your support system? If he loved you, and just wanted you to be happy, then why is he trying to separate you from something that does? Not just your family, but a simple haircut. The vibe I get from your post history is that he seems to never want you to have any you time, period.

Also the refusal for couple's counseling; ok, granted, he is within his rights not to want to go. But this also shows that he honestly believes not only that he is not the problem, but that he sees no problems, not with his behavior, not with how things are going, not with the way you guys engage with each other, not with inflaming you to the point where it seems like you are on the verge of a breakdown. And also especially, not with how he manipulates the kiddos. 

And I am just a stranger on the internet, I know, but my heart goes out to you! And I care about you and your littles. The thing that I would be asking myself the most, especially after his repeated refusals for date night is ""does this person want to change? Does he want to actively work with me to help make this situation better? Is this an actual partnership? Do I feel valued? Do I feel loved? Do I want this for my children?"" 

Whatever you decide, know that you have support from this community. Be safe!"
survivorsofabuse,fic9mf7,t3_f7kd67,1582341071.0,"You're talking about it here and now with us. And I think that is a huge first step! So congratulations for that! I'm so sorry for what happened and what you had to go through. No one should ever have to endure that.

But you are still here and you are tough. I am glad you're here, because it also gives other people a voice and may help them process as well!

This may sound stupid, but if you don't want to talk verbally, is it possible that you could write or type out what you want to say and present it to your therapist that way?"

Literally HER WHOLE FUCKING LIFE was her fucking car! We stopped being friends because I thought there may have been more below the surface, but nope. It's like I told people, I had never met anyone before whose entire personality was ""Honda civic""."

Whenever you feel like calling your moral compass into question over this, just remember he has none, and you should feel no remorse or guilt over this."

LifeAfterNarcissism,ffuckr9,t3_ev6w84,1580239125.0,"Based on my own experience, yes. It is a nex friend, and I won't go into too much detail as it has become a legal issue for me because of her actions and rumour mongering.

I think this is because when we leave them, we have deprived them of a supply and knowing that we see them for who and what they actually are is unacceptable to them. Hence, we have ""hurt"" them, so in return they need to make us suffer as well"
adhdwomen,fftdtb0,t3_euud2y,1580217603.0,"I feel ya sister, this is the story of my fucking life!!

I eventually just get kind of frustrated and mentally yell at myself, because it is ridiculous to have to keep refilling a tub when the hot water goes cold. This is probably not a good way, but I just self reprimand until I move. I used to have an egg timer that I lugged around with me to let me know when it was time to love and get out and shit. But I'm in a bit of a slump lately and haven't been doing that"

BDSMcommunity,ffq8m6v,t3_eui0es,1580126020.0,"Thank you for writing this, I thought I was the only one. I am processing through a lot of what has happened to me and it makes me shut down and not want to be vulnerable in front of anyone. My ex dom is a friend to me still, but he is concerned about my recent emotional shut down. It's like I explained to him, it's not anything personal, I just feel this is me learning to sort out who I am and separating it from the abuse I endured."
AmItheAsshole,ffoqp7b,t3_eu8f1b,1580080512.0,"Lol! NTA.... my dog, while being very smart, does very stupid things some days. I will never tell him that he is stupid on these days, I will just look at him and say ""oh, my baby! It's a good thing you are pretty..."""
AmItheAsshole,ffom2wr,t3_eu903q,1580079012.0,"NTA. Your way sounds so beautiful and lovely. Most people should aspire to be as graceful and dignified as you are being about this. I'm afraid I don't have any real legal advice to offer, but I am sorry you have to leave this earth walk as early as you are and am glad you have made the most of it. I will pray for you, if that is alright and hope everything turns out exactly as you wish and that your family finds peace in it."
SubSanctuary,ffojmnp,t3_eue10q,1580078375.0,"Sweetie, no one is really in their right head when they are drunk. Couple that with what sounds like a PTSD flare up and it actually makes perfect sense. You were so trapped inside your own head  that everything probably felt restricting at that point, even something you love, like your collar.

Do you watch greys anatomy? Do you remember the episode where burke left Christina at the altar and she melts down and meredith has to cut her out of her wedding dress? That's probably where you were.  

You didn't ask for help because you probably literally didn't know how to in that moment and THAT IS OK. Be gentle with yourself. You've been through a lot and deserve kindness. You are also your dom's most valuable possession, valued above all else and you need to treat yourself with the same dignity and respect as you would with any other of his items. Please don't beat yourself up too badly precious. ‚ù§"

AmItheAsshole,ffo0r0m,t3_eu3ywn,1580072953.0,"NTA. This pisses me off so bad because as someone with a service dog, I have a hard enough time when ""ESA's"" try to attack my SD. ESA's, while not any less valid for those who need them, do NOT have public access because they don't have the amount of training and conditioning that an SD does. I'm so sick of the shit that other people cause for people with disabilities because they think it's cute or fun to bring their dog out with them. It is not FUN for me to need my dog. I love him. He has helped me beyond all belief. But there is a lot of work, planning and organizing that goes into needing him. It ostracizes me from other people and puts a stigma on me. I am mentally prepped for a verbal battle every time I into a store or establishment because even though I have never had an issue with any of the business owners in my area, the public at large are assholes who feel it is their right to ask about my business, try to put their hands on my animal, or worst of all, try to hurt him so that they can elicit a reaction from him to say ""see?!?! He's a fake service animal!""

Your acquaintance is a fucking asshole who was properly reprimanded. 

Sorry for the rant!"

""I don't really want to play board games with his friends (social anxiety).""

So why does your roommate need to be punished for this?

""... I just want to chill and relax in quietude.""

Are you not already doing this by doing all of the things you listed above, like gaming in your room, gym, driving around, etc? And could you technically not chill and relax these on a Friday or Sunday evening instead?"

I understand the mods can only do so much, and technically most of what gets posted doesn't go against rules. It's just as another redditor said, it feels more like a sub for teens to try out their creative writing skills lately :( not really anyone's fault, but discouraging none the less."
