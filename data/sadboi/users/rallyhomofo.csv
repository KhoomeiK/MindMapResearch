BPD,ffurbbj,t3_ev5upy,1580247853.0,"Thank you for your vent, you've voiced things I go through and couldn't tell if it was the BPD or not. The biggest one for me recently is nowhere feeling like home.. I've been homesick for the last month or so. I just dont feel like I've been home lately, but my partner is bringing me down to my hometown to see family and friends to help. I cant wait!

I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to rant, it's some things I needed to hear that weren't just in my head :)"
