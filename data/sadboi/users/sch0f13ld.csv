At first I was extremely wary of getting addicted and making my mental health worse so I kept my distance from it a bit. But I’d made friends who were also starting to smoke, so we’d hang out every once in a while and share one joint and get blasted. Then I realised weed wasn’t making my mental health worse, and although it got a little better I was still struggling a lot. So I slowly started upping my usage and over time found it actually significantly improved my functioning. 

Of course it wasn’t the only thing I relied on to cope tho, and I still took my psych meds, went to therapy, and tried to improve myself. And I still have quite a way to go, but the weed does help."

She was often neglected, and abused physically, sexually, and mentally/emotionally her whole life, til she moved out at 16. Her adolescent and young adult life has been full of toxic relationships, multiple instances of rape and sexual assault, numerous suicide attempts, and being so incapacitated by her mental illness she hasn’t been able to work or complete her studies. 

But because she couldn’t work and had no support from family, she had little to no funds to access quality therapy or doctors. It was only after more than 6 months on a waiting list that she was able to get access to community mental health services. But during this time her mental health declined so much she had a psychotic break, and poor medication management lead to her putting on 30-40kg in a period of months. 

Things eventually got so bad that her brain basically locked her own memories from her just to keep her alive - a condition called psychogenic amnesia. Now any significant stress or triggers, including remembering her own traumatic past, can cause her to have a memory loss, either overnight or suddenly, where she’ll wake up or come to with no memory of who or where she is."

The older man would be the ‘active’ ‘lover’, while the boy or younger man would be the ‘passive’ or ‘beloved’. All men would be expected to take a wife and have kids when they were adults regardless. 

There’s the myth of Ganymede, who Zeus basically abducted as a boy because of his beauty. And of Pelops, who was apparently taken by Poseidon as a lover as a boy. Later on however, when he was an adult, Pelops was looking to find a wife, and went on to compete against King Oenonaus for his daughter Hippodameia’s hand in marriage, which he won thanks to winged horses provided by his old lover Poseidon (and perhaps a bit of cheating)."

If I feel I can’t perfectly stick to a routine it makes me panic, feel overwhelmed, and beat myself up. But not having a routine means I basically get nothing at all done. Luckily I’ve got a couple of weeks off from uni atm to readjust and catch up with things."

Instead of mandating a course before getting children, resources like books, articles, or classes could be provided free of charge or at least be subsidised for new parents to at least encourage/incentivise parents and caregivers to become more educated.

And I think depression and burnout both contribute to such symptoms. For me I’ve noticed my depression gets a lot worse when I’m constantly burnt out, and that’s likely how I became depressed in the first place.

aspiememes,fjfiwtn,t1_fjew9pd,1583292719.0,"Not who you replied to but weed has helped me a lot too. I was on clonazepam for a time too, and while I didn’t get many side effects, it didn’t so shit for my anxiety or sleep issues other than make me drowsy (but I would still struggle to sleep). 

I’ve been on benzos and even antipsychotics in order to improve my sleep, and while some of them did help me get to sleep and wake up earlier, I was always going to sleep feeling just as stressed and anxious as I did during the day, so I would wake up already feeling like shit. 

Weed helped me relax, unwind, and truly shut my brain up for a while. This won’t be the case for everyone, and depends on which strain, but weed really helps with my anxiety and just calms my brain down. I could go to bed really feeling relaxed instead of carrying all that tension and stress with me to the next day. I’ve noticed since I started using more regularly that it takes me less time to recover from breakdowns/shutdowns or any distressing event. Instead of taking many weeks or even months, it now takes only a week or so."

I still can’t work, can’t drive, I still live at home, any social contact is extremely draining, and can barely keep up with part time study (2 units per semester out of a possible 4).

At least do research and make sure if you do try it you’re doing it safely. And keep in mind that everyone reacts to different drugs differently, even legal prescription medications. 

For some people prescription medication like antidepressants and anxiolytics, in combination with therapy or counselling, can help enough that they can recover. But for others, including myself, they either don’t do enough, do nothing at all, or just cause more problems."

aspiememes,fjcyltx,t1_fjbxtgz,1583240983.0,"Everyone’s experience will be unique and equally valid. I’m one of the people who was extremely relieved when i was diagnosed at age 20. I had been and still am really struggling with anxiety and depression, and have been since I had a breakdown when I was 17. I had tried medications, was in therapy, and my family and friends were all very supportive and understanding. I also haven’t worked since I was 16, and still live at home. But I couldn’t go to labs or classes, or keep up with uni work, couldn’t even bring myself to continue learning to drive, my sleep was abysmal, and I was perpetually tired. I hadn’t even experienced anything close to traumatic or even very stressful that could explain why I couldn’t seem to get better. 

I already felt broken. Barely functional, reliant on those around me, and with no tolerance for stress or adversity. I couldn’t even do what so many other severely depressed and anxious people do. Getting a diagnosis for me made me feel less broken, because it meant there was a valid neurological reason why I was struggling so much, and that there were others like me who’d had similar experiences, so I wasn’t alone. It also gave me an idea of how to approach getting better."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fj9jvpz,t1_fj9b6og,1583151229.0,"Everybody reacts differently to hormonal birth control, and how you react can even change with time. 

I hear some women swear by IUDs, because they don’t or rarely get periods anymore, and they avoid other side effects related to systemic use of hormones. But others say it makes periods heavier and/or more painful. 

Most women get side effects and spotting for a few months when starting a new pill or method, but then things usually even out, and if they’re lucky the method can work for them with minimal side effects for at least the next few years. But for me it’s the opposite: new pills/methods work nearly perfectly the first few months, and then everything starts going to shit again and I have to switch methods."
