acting,fmijfsh,t3_fvfk5s,1586110782.0,"Hey! So I actually did the evening introductory program with Stella Adler in NYC last summer. Do it, do it, do it! There were people in my class who had been in Nickelodeon shows, there were models, and there were people who hadn’t done a single play since 7th grade. It was a remarkable experience, couldn’t recommend it more. Each day you start with an hour of voice and speech training followed by 1 of 3 classes for the rest of the day (Acting Technique, Scene Study, and Movement) depending on the day of the week. The teachers are captivating, passionate, and many are still heavily active in the industry. After the intensive, you can then be invited to or audition for the advanced classes which are even more fun imo. Hope this helped!!"

Hemsworth’s peachy white tree trunk arm is a lot less distracting when it’s covered in black. Plus, as the audience, we’re supposed to be looking at the pain in Thanos’ face here so all attention must be directed to that."

BipolarReddit,f0lgvld,t3_d5aclb,1568717427.0,"Stay strong, never lose hope. Over time, we will find our own ways to keep balance. 

A nice thing I like to think of whenever I’m feeling beaten down by bipolar is actually from Captain America: Civil War. It’s the scene where vision is talking to scarlet witch about the mind stone and says “I have no idea what this thing in my head is, but I wish to understand it. One day I just might.” 

It was oddly comforting to hear— he was so sure of himself when he said it. I have no idea what’s going on in my brain half the time, but one day I just might. The key is knowing you’ll get there even when it sucks most. 

I don’t know you, but I love you. You will rise out of this. Thank you for taking the time to share."
