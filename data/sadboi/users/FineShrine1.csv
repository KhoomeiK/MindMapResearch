SuicideWatch,f596xck,t1_f596ufh,1572073835.0,I’ve tried this many times. Squeezing muscles aggravates my Tourette’s syndrome. Turning the muscle squeezes into tics
SuicideWatch,f596s7t,t1_f596jr9,1572073613.0,I’m very overweight so yoga is pretty much impossible. I also find meditation makes me more anxious. I can’t sit still and focus long enough for it to matter. I want to die because I can’t keep dealing with the large and small things in my life that drive me insane. My anxiety and depression have me staying in bed unable to do so much as shower more than once a week. My house looks like a dump site and I can’t bring myself to get out of bed to do anything. Mild I know but it feels like the end of the world to me. I could go for hours about all the tiny things that make me want to die.
SuicideWatch,f596ej1,t3_d92gf2,1572073019.0,I often feel this. Like I’m breathing air someone more important could be breathing. All those babies that died when I lived. I’d trade places with them in a second.
