Does the head virologist recommend to stay indoors? Does he say it lives on surfaces? Should that person still hang out with his friends? Is the virus alive longer than other viruses in the air? Just to let you know, I have asthma and and autoimmune disease I might need one of those  ICU beds even without corona like many others like me, I’m 36 and skinny so people like to assume I’m fit. That person is not helping at all, and for now we all don’t know enough, that will take years. It’s overall better to stay vigilant that’s something we can’t retroactively! Better being labeled as “over dramatic” now, than the “oh if we had just known” attitude later! 

“CDC, the World Health Organization and others health authorities, have emphasised that both washing one's hands and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily are key in preventing Covid-19's spread. So although we still don't know exactly how many cases are being caused directly by contaminated surfaces, experts advise exercising caution.” - BBC

“One aspect that has been unclear is exactly how long SARS-CoV-2, the name of the virus that causes the disease Covid-19, can survive outside the human body. Some studies on other coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers, found they can survive on metal, glass and plastic for as long as nine days, unless they are properly disinfected. Some can even hang around for up to 28 days in low temperatures.” -BBC

“Coronaviruses are well known to be particularly resilient in terms of where they can survive. And researchers are now beginning to understand more about how this affects the spread of the new coronavirus.” - BBC

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home

“Neeltje van Doremalen, a virologist at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and her colleagues at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana, have done some of the first tests of how long SARS-CoV-2 can last for on different surfaces. Their study, which has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that the virus could survive in droplets for up to three hours after being coughed out into the air. Fine droplets between 1-5 micrometres in size – about 30 times small than the width of a human hair – can remain airborne for several hours in still air.” - BBC
