Anxiety,fk7lcdr,t3_fgy6n9,1583938805.0,"I’m having the same reaction as you right now about a job offer. Constant anxiety about all the little things that could go wrong.
I just wish I could relax and be happy."
Anxiety,fg44ra8,t3_ewbhpn,1580496137.0,Thank you! I just realized how tense I was. I needed this.
TrollXOver30,fb5sykl,t3_ebez36,1576533747.0,I really hate my job. Today was one of those days when I just wanted to scream ’I quit!’.  Hopefully I’ll be able to change career in a couple of months when I’m done with my studies.
