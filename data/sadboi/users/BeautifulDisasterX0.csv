Brianna is rushing into relationships (still) and it isn't smart to be bringing all of these people around her son and moving them in.

The only example I can think of off the top of my head - Idk if you watch teen mom but they aren't allowed to share their pregnancies until it airs on TV. It's kind of like that. It's in their contract not to expose the major events as scripted. They film those girls with fake pregnant bellies to do interviews after they have given birth but we aren't supposed to know that.

However the real scenario is simply that she gets paid to act like she's trash on TV because people love drama. Her husband sits at home waiting for that check.

The most common complaint I see is over box braids and afros. Yet it's clear that a huge amount of African American women have straight wigs, often times blonde. If they don't even want their hair like that why do they care if someone else does? A hair style doesn't *belong* to anybody or any group of people. Otherwise white people would own blonde hair. (lol) 

Another common thing I've seen is when some African Americans talk about how white women get butt jobs to look black. When in reality not all black women are built like that. Some black women are very petite. They are categorizing *themselves*! Which is beyond idiotic. 

When it comes to Native Americans I think people know by now what is appropriate and not for the most part. Unless someone is looking for attention or they are a kid who doesn't know better.
