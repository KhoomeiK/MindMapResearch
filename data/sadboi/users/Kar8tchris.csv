TLDR don't have crushes, just ask someone out if you think they're attractive, and if they don't say yes right then, move on to the next one. It's easier to cut the attachment off before it forms than to let it develop over years and then try to cut it off when you finally ask. You can build that attachment up if your relationship lasts long enough if they say yes."
