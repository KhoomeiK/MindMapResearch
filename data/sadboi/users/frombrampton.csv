Hypothyroidism,fpw4hze,t1_fpvubam,1588957110.0,"My TSH was at 15 when I was 10 yrs old. 15 is extremely high, so you‚Äôve probably had it for a while for it to be that elevated. I definitely experienced most of the symptoms but probably don‚Äôt remember them too well. Initially, I was heavily constipated and felt miserable using the washroom. This lead to my checkup and blood test. My neck was also swollen (thyroid gland). I was chubby and overweight as a kid. My hair was always thin as far as I could remember. I had dry skin, trouble concentration at school, mild depression, and my hands at feet were cold. I‚Äôve been taking 50mcg of Levo and it works pretty well. Hypo is pretty annoying, but fine once it‚Äôs taken care of. From time to time I still experience some symptoms, but I regularly get blood tests and visit my Endocrinologist. Are you taking Levo right now?"
