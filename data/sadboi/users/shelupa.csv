I have a fear (not a phobia) that Ill touch something in the shower with my feet. Hair, grime, dirt, what ever may be in the shower from simply washing off. Our shower is always spotless, and even though I cant see anything on the bottom, I still have to clean it before I shower. A lot of times I have to use a wash rag to stand on because I cant take standing on the shower floor. Its mainly because I always had a nasty tub when I was a kid. I have the same issue with dishes. My parents never cleaned their dishwasher, so food was always still on the dishes when you pulled them out of the cabinets.

Him being late sometimes is not a good excuse to not cook before he gets home. His meal can be re-heated, or put in the oven on warm to keep it from getting cold. 

Its not sexest to expect you to have a meal ready for him when he gets home. Its not expected of you because youre a woman, its expected of you because youre home and he is working to support the household now. Asking you to cook and have a meal ready for when he gets home is not to much to ask. And you making this about him ""not wanting to spend time with you"" is manipulative."
