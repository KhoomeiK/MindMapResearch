mentalhealth,fpooylk,t3_gek4b1,1588788164.0,"I completely agree.

I have anxiety and OCD and have them brushed off constantly by family and friends. However, I also have a physical, chronic illness that causes daily pain, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, etc. That is a ""real"" physical ailment, not a mental illness, but it is also primarily invisible on the outside, and I get the same treatment for that as well - people not really taking it seriously, brushing it off, etc. So I think it is at least, in part, the fact that it is something that people can't see and therefore can't connect with as easily. For the record, I think this is a shitty excuse. I think having some empathy and compassion can go a long way, and we need to change the perception around both mental and physical invisible illnesses so that this negative judgement happens a lot less."

I am HSP and also have OCD and anxiety, so naturally I feel as though I need things done a certain way and can feel kind of chaotic or anxious if things aren't done properly. And it seems I'm always the one who notices everything that needs to be done, or that cares the most, so naturally I end up doing the brunt of running the household. 

There isn't really a true solution to this because ultimately I can't change what/how people notice things, and it's unlikely that people will suddenly start noticing the things that my HSP brain does. However, I have started sharing these feelings and frustrations with my husband and trying different approaches to help him to ""notice"" and take some of the burden off my shoulders. We have started using an app called Tody where I can program in everything that needs to be done, all the chores, one-time and recurring tasks, and then assign each task to different people. The app keeps track of what gets done and when, and you can set up how often things need to get done and by whom. If you buy the premium version (only $5 a year), you can have it so each account syncs up to each other - so mine and my husband's accounts sync up and I can see everything that's been done or still needs to be done. Honestly this has been HUGE in helping this problem!! It no longer matters if he ""notices"" the mess anymore - the app tells him his to-do list without me having to be the one to nag (or have to just do it myself).

I had a very close friend who I had known since the beginning of high school and I had been visiting her every week or couple weeks. When I became ill, I suddenly didn't hear from her for several months to a year at a time.

Anxiety,flofctl,t1_flnuqvd,1585337224.0,"Hi again,

Definitely try eliminating plastic regardless of how the vet stay this weekend goes - especially the food and water bowls. Changing our bowls from plastic to ceramic or metal was the first thing our vet suggested we do, even before changing up the diets or trying the other stuff, because it is that important. It doesn't matter what food you're feeding your cat if the food is in a plastic bowl and the kitty turns out to have a plastic allergy! And plastic allergies are the most common in cats.

As for the Feline Hyperesthesia syndrome - I know your vet is a professional and has examined your cat, so I can't say that I know better than him/her. I WILL say, however, that ALL the symptoms of hyperesthesia in cats can ALSO be caused by eosinophilic granuloma complex! The main symptoms are listed as ""episodes of agitation,Â self-mutilation, and a characteristic rippling of the skin when touched."" All of those things are also normal symptoms exhibited during a bad eosinophilic flare. I mean, if your skin felt super itchy everywhere and raw and painful, wouldn't you act agitated? And the self-mutilation is actually just the cat trying desperately to deal with how itchy they are. But that flare could likely be caused by something in the environment that can be changed and fixed, or medicated at the very least. Assuming the cat has another (way more rare) neurodegenerative disease is much more of a leap in this case, especially when all of the symptoms of it can already be explained by the eosinophilic skin allergies.

Basically, I'm saying there's a lot of hope for your cat. Eosinophilic granuloma complex is fairly common and is highly treatable. New drugs for it came out just in the last few years, even. But because of that, if your vet doesn't stay abreast of the latest research, he/she may not know about those treatments, which would be a colossal shame for your kitty and you! So I would highly recommend doing your own research (or feel free to ask me) and letting your vet know what other things you want to try.

Definitely tell your vet you want to try another medication like Atopica. And if that doesn't work, there are still a few other options. Honestly, anxiety meds likely wouldn't do anything in this situation. If the cause is an allergy (or several) then it's a bit of an oversight to assume that the cat is acting agitated or mutilating its skin because of anxiety. It's way more likely to be how itchy and sore it is! Anxiety meds then wouldn't work and would be a waste of money. I'm really surprised the vet didn't try more allergy-specific meds other than steroids before coming to the conclusion that anxiety or a seizure-disorder were the culprit! 

Try eliminating the plastic bowls, mats and containers. Try switching to canned food instead of dry (that's been our experience for the most success). Try other meds. Please don't give up on your kitty <3 it is so likely that she just has allergies, and doesn't even have feline hyperesthesia syndrome at all as all those symptoms could be explained by the EGC."
Anxiety,flmy4ej,t1_flms3c7,1585301575.0,"Hi, I just want to say that my cat has eosinophilic granuloma complex too, and we have had success treating it by:

- changing the cat litter we use to be either wheat based, corn based or paper based (not clay)

- eliminating all plastic cat stuff (most important is to use metal or ceramic or glass saucers/bowls instead of plastic, store the cat food in a glass container instead of.plastic, remove plastic place mats etc.)

- try eliminating different ingredients in the diet as this is the most common culprit. For example, your cat might be allergic to a specific protein, like chicken, turkey, a type of fish, etc. You can experiment by trying a novel protein (like duck or venison etc.) as the only type of food for a few weeks and then see if the skin gets better, if it does you can reintroduce proteins one by one to see if it is the trigger/allergy. Sometimes instead of the protein it could be a kind of filler or preservative used in the food, for example, grains, peas, or a chemical used to preserve the food

- if you feed primarily dry food (kibble) switch to a wet food. My cat will ALWAYS have a flare up when we give her dry food, no matter what the brand or ingredients are. However on only canned food she does much better, and we feed canned food that doesnt have any chicken or turkey as those are ones we found (through elimination diet) to be triggers.

- lastly, if the above options don't work, you should know that there are many other medications to try other than steroids before giving up!! Steroids arent the best option anyway. There is a medication called Atopica that can now be used in cats with great success. And many other immune suppressing medications that stop that allergic reaction from happening.

There are lots of options to explore to help your kitty. If you need to, find another vet who will explore those options with you before giving up. I'm happy to chat more about it with you if you'd like!"

People want to say that they support mental health and mental illness awareness almost just so they are in the ""good"" camp, so they can seem progressive and open-minded.

It's like people who say ""call me if you need anything"" but if you ever actually call, they either don't respond or are just ""too busy"". People want the credit without the effort. 

If you find a couple good people to talk to who actually do support you in a healthy way, who can empathize, then I'd say just focus on those people and don't even bother trying to get the others to understand - they likely won't change and itll be exhausting and negative for you.

They make ignorant comments like ""you just need to walk around a mall a bunch and then you won't be anxious anymore"" (yeah, that's TOTALLY how a disorder works), or comments like when my mother-in-law said ""don't you worry that you won't be a good mother one day because of your anxiety?"" That was a a doozy. Basically, people like ""saying"" they support and understand mental illness, but when it comes down to it, they have NO idea and cannot empathize at all. Since they have never experienced it, it can lead to ignorant and harmful comments. Luckily, my husband and some of my sisters do understand and are supportive, but I've basically decided to stop talking about my mental health with anyone who I think will make harmful comments (ex. the in-laws, certain friends). Sometimes you just have to realize that some people don't (and may never) understand and may behave in a shitty way, and lessen contact with those people or just no longer choose to discuss those things with them for your own sanity.

Anxiety,fbvve6j,t3_eeksji,1577136622.0,"My husband is a grower also. It's actually pretty amazing what the size difference is between when its ""not in use"" and erect. I have absolutely no problem with this at all - why would I? It is actually super convenient - when he's not using it, it isn't super in the way or flapping around down there like it would be if it was larger while soft. It's more protected. It's less noticeable while wearing different styles of clothes so there's no embarrassing incidents. And yet, when its time for business, it's a perfectly decent size and I have zero complaints in that department. 

It sounds as though that girl that said that was incredibly immature and perhaps also very inexperienced - maybe she had never come across (or even heard of) the type of penis that grows instead of shows, which is actually a very common penis type! She likely made that comment out of naivety and inexperience, and didn't think about how rude and completely insensitive something like that would be to say. I would chalk it up to her being a rude and inexperienced person who is obviously not compatible with you personality-wise. Just because she said that, though, doesn't mean that there is anything at all wrong with you. In fact, I can assure you that there is nothing abnormal about how you work down there - ""growers"" are so common! 

As a woman, I'd also like to add that the idea of penis size isn't as important as a lot of guys tend to think it is. The only times there may be issues at all would be in a scenario where the penis is insanely large or micro - and even then there are workarounds! Nothing is ever a lost cause. Women like different things. Most of the time, foreplay is much more important than the penetration itself anyway (at least for me!) And penis size isn't that big of a deal. The emotional connection, foreplay, and external stimulation play huge roles for many ladies, and we aren't that hung up on what size/shape your penis is.

I hope this helps a little. I am so sorry that you have felt this way for so long due to someone's insensitive and incorrect comment to you - they were just a rude human being. Body shame can be a tough monster to tackle. But you have already made great strides by being brave enough to open up about your insecurities, so good on you!"

antidepressants,fac78sz,t1_fa89lkc,1575934637.0,"Hey, vent away - it's good to open up and talk to others about how you're feeling. 

I can relate completely to your description of feeling trapped and how that increases anxiety. For me, I need an ""escape route"" to mitigate my anxiety and that includes everyday things like feeling like I can control my anxiety or sleep, so I totally get where you're coming from.

If your brain associates being anxious with meditating, perhaps try meditating at a time when you already feel calm. If you only ever meditate when you feel anxious then it makes sense that you would start associating the meditation with anxiety. Therefore it makes sense that meditating at other times of the day when you are already feeling a lot better would help you to associate the meditation with positive experiences as well.

One thing that's really problematic with anxiety disorders is that you start becoming anxious about the anxiety itself. You can end up getting panic attacks because you're worried that you might have a panic attack. It sounds like this is probably what's going on with you right now. The only ways to help this that I have found, are trying to break that I finite loop of fear by just continuing to put yourself out there and have those experiences regardless of that fear of ""what if I have an anxiety attack?"" And medication can help you get out there more once you start feeling a bit more balanced, too. The more that you go out and have positive experiences where nothing bad happens, the more confident you will feel that you can do it the next time and that anxiety will gradually lessen. This is easier said than done because it means feeling the fear and doing it anyway - which is incredibly hard. But it can be helpful. 

For example, just because you've had some anxiety in your bedroom before doesn't mean that your bedroom itself is an unsafe space. It just means that you've had anxiety. I have anxiety every day so basically ive had it in every room of my house - but that doesn't mean my house is bad, it just means that I have an anxiety disorder that I'm battling, and that's ok. Try to remember that anxiety itself, while absolutely terrifying, isn't dangerous and it's not going to kill you. So you had some anxiety and panic in your bedroom before. That's ok. Maybe you were over tired. Maybe you didnt eat well or balanced that day. Maybe it was a bad anxiety day. There are many factors that could have made you feel bad. Your bedroom itself is just a room; it is not going to hurt you and being in that room does not mean you will always feel bad. Instead of avoiding the room, try spending more time in there when you feel calm and arent even trying to sleep. Put some things in there that make you feel comfy. Maybe a nice blanket, a night light, or soothing sounds. Create some positive experiences in the room so that you will associate it less with anxious times.

Something that I find helpful is acceptance therapy. Basically you accept that you are an anxious person and that you get anxiety and you say to yourself ""Bring it on. I want to feel all of the anxiety because I know it can't hurt me and it's all going to be okay in the end, and I know it will pass, so bring it on"" and actually the harder you try to force yourself to feel that anxiety, the less power it has over you, and you're able to move on quicker from it. You can also be compassionate to yourself. Be understanding that you are anxious. Your brain is doing a wonderful nov of trying to protect you. Pat your mind on the back metaphorically and tell it that everything is ok. Understand that it is just your brain trying to keep you safe, it's just that we live in a world that sets it off too often for no reason. I don't know if that would be helpful for you but it might be worth trying.

As for worrying about having a panic attack while at work, I do understand that working in a big box store must be super stressful. I know that for me, whenever I go to the grocery store like Superstore or Costco, I get super overwhelmed and I hate the lights and the crowds and everything that goes along with it. But I can tell you, one thing that helps me is that when I'm there, I remember that everybody else who's there is honestly just going about their day... people typically are quite self-centered and self-absorbed and when they're going out and running their errands they're not thinking about what other people are doing, they're just worried about getting their errands done, buying the thing that they have to buy, and getting out of there so they can go home and do something more fun that they enjoy. They aren't going to be watching you and judging you and wondering what you're doing, and I doubt they would even notice if you were really anxious or not, because people typically don't really care what other people around them are doing. That might be kind of a negative view of the world but I do find that it helps me to realize that people arent noticing what I'm doing or saying, which is a trigger of my anxiety.

The other thing is I remind myself is, how would I treat somebody else if they had a full-blown panic attack in front of me? If somebody fainted or freaked out or was feeling super sick, and I came across them, I would not be mean or judgmental or rude or embarrass them or anything like that. I would be compassionate and caring and I would want to do everything that I could to help them. Chances are other people around you are going to be the same kind of friendly people who are compassionate and caring. So while they really don't care about what anyone around them is doing (because they're just living their life), if you DID happen to have a freak out or an illness or an episode of some kind in front of them, I'm sure the majority of people would just try to be helpful and make you feel better. 

I try to keep this in mind when I go out: what's the absolute worst thing, in my mind, that could happen? What if I get really dizzy and pass out? Okay, well, in that situation I'm sure that somebody would just be really compassionate and try to help me. Maybe they would get me some water and then I would eventually go home. And it wouldn't matter that it happened, and there'd be no point in being embarrassed, because I don't know those people and I would never have to see them again. You can kind of talk yourself through situations like that so that you realize, ""hey, this doesn't actually matter, and even the worst case scenario that I can imagine happening isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things"". So, worst case scenario, you have a panic attack while you're at work tomorrow. You could take a five-minute break and go and have some fresh air. Or you could step outside the store for a while. Or you could go into the staff room for a while and just take a breather. Or you could let your boss or someone else know that you're not feeling well and they would be understanding and you could go home. Honestly the worst case scenario isn't that bad, and even if somebody DID see you have a panic attack, they would probably be caring and compassionate and just want to make you feel better. 

Plus, chances are you will be fine because you've been fine on many of the other days, and even if you feel anxious, it's usually not visible on the outside. I often am super anxious and people tell me they had no idea because you can't tell externally how I'm feeling. So just remember that it's not that obvious to everybody else, and panic attacks generally only last around 15 minutes, so worst case scenario, you have to have a little break. That's okay. Just be compassionate to yourself and realize that not everything will be catastrophic, even in the worst-case scenario.

If you're worried that wellbutrin is making you more anxious and isn't working for you, or that ativan isnt helping you enough, talk to your doctor. That's what they're there for :) 

Everything will be okay. For both of us."
antidepressants,fa7z3su,t3_e7xkj9,1575839450.0,"Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I am in the exact same boat - I started back onto trintellix (an atypical SSRI) a couple weeks ago and my doctor also gave me ativan to take during the transition (as needed) to help with increased anxiety and panic attacks. Like you, I am always super hesitant to take it because of fears of addiction or tolerance, but my doctor reiterated to me again that I shouldn't be so afraid if it and won't get addicted to it during such short term use. I maybe only take it 1-2 times a week when it gets overwhelmingly bad. 

Some things to keep in mind: there are many different types of benzos. Ativan is just one of them. 
Out of all the benzos, I have been told by several medical professionals that ativan is the gentlest/weakest form of them. It is less potent than, say, xanax. And like all meds, some work better for certain individuals than others. If ativan doesnt work for you, that doesnt mean that all hope is lost and that you no longer have a rescue drug. There are many others that you can try. Clonazepam and xanax are two examples. When I take ativan, I have a fairly subtle relaxing feeling and it brings down my overall anxiety to a manageable level, but I dont get any kind of high feeling or total elimination of all anxiety. When I take clonazepam, I feel a lot more conked out on it and it usually makes me super sleepy, so that isnt one that i can take during the day. Both affect me super differently. I haven't tried xanax or any of the others. 

The other thing to think about is dosage. The lowest dose of ativan is 0.5 mg. This is what my doctor gave me, and to be honest, it usually is only enough to knock the anxiety back down to a level where I can deal with it the rest of the way. To have more relief, I'd need to take at least 1 mg. Some people have to take 2 mg to get relief. You can talk to your doctor about not only the type of benzo that works for you, but also dose. You may need a higher rescue dose or just to try another one altogether. 

Hopefully, this will only be needed super short term, because I'm sure the goal is that eventually your ssri/wellbutrin combo will kick in and start managing your daily mental health better.

Hope this helps. Please hang in there... I'm in the same boat right now, my anxiety and panic seems like its drowning me, it is a horrible disorder... but there's always some hope that things will improve."

Getting onto a new one, weaning down off of one, or changing doses are all tough transitions for sure. I'm currently getting back onto Trintellix again after being off meds for a while and it is extremely difficult, and I know this drug worked for me before, which means everything I'm currently feeling (increased depression, anxiety and hopelessness, vivid dreams, nausea, digestive upset,  headaches, sleep issues, etc.) are all from the onboarding/dose changing process itself. It is super hard (I'm right there with you and feel like giving up myself) but you should know that this is a fairly normal experience when switching meds and it should improve after a few weeks. Any time you make any changes you kind of have to start the 4-6 week waiting period over again to wait for it to settle down (though have hope because sometimes you will feel better much quicker than that).

It is in a group all its own (it is seratonergic in that it affects the reuptake of serotonin, however it also affects some different receptors as well, which means it isnt a typical ssri and is a new class). My experience with it wasn't perfect, however, it was the closest I have gotten thus far to finding an effective medication that I can tolerate. 

The main side effects I had on it were nausea, which I solved by taking it with my big dinner meal each day. There were a lot less sexual side effects, fatigue and weight gain type side effects as compared to any of the other meds I was on. 

I will say that it took a higher dose for it to effectively manage my anxiety symptoms as it seems to be more suited to depression (that being said though, it DID do a pretty good job of helping my anxiety once I reached a high enough dose). 

Even though the trintellix was working pretty well for me, I came off all of my meds 2.5 years ago because I was hoping to cope without them using all the therapy/techniques that I learned in that time (and I wanted to start a family and was nervous to take antidepressants during pregnancy), and I have to say, these past 2.5 years have been ridiculously awful. My anxiety is so terrible that I haven't been able to drive my car in over 2 years now. And forget starting a family - my anxiety, OCD and agoraphobia got so severe that I haven't been able to even think about getting pregnant. 

I just had a doctors appointment today actually to finally get back onto medication because I can't take this anymore. And after much discussion with my doctor I decided to go ahead and get back onto the trintellix, because while it isn't perfect, it has a lot less side effects for me compared to any of the others I've tried. I finally feel somewhat hopeful again about getting my life back.

If you've tried many of the more first-line antidepressants and haven't gotten on very well with them, trintellix might be a good option to try out as it is so different in how it works (and is a very new drug on the market). I will say however to check that your insurance will cover it beforehand as its newness means it is incredibly expensive. Because it's so new, there also haven't been many studies completed on it yet regarding its safety during pregnancy/breast feeding, so that's something to keep in mind if you just had a little one. 

Hope that is at least somewhat helpful :) good luck with everything!"
