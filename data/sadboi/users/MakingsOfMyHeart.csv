NarcissisticAbuse,fhw16a9,t3_f4v6eo,1581904438.0,"All of these comments are so true it’s scary. My nex was a really good liar at first. It took me a few years to catch on because he always had great excuses to cover his lies. Plus his whole entourage of family & friends that backed him up. I started to think I was legit crazy. I started to think that maybe I really was a crazy liar. But logically, it made no sense to me. He turned everything around on me & made it seem as if I was doing everything he was actually doing. Took me nearly 10 yrs to leave. & I was pregnant to make matters worse. But we’ve been split for over a year & his lies & manipulation have only gotten more pathetic. Even his kids catch him & call him out on certain things. It’s awful. And if anyone calls him out on it then it’s like a 2 yr old throwing a tantrum & being completely illogical. He would probably make a great case study for psychology. It amazes me what he thinks people will fall for. But he’s been doing it for so long I guess he never expected that anyone would catch on."

OCPoetry,felxgos,t3_eprr1e,1579233397.0,"This is my first comment in this sub. And maybe I connected so deeply with every line of your poetry because I’m all too aware of the things you speak of. It didn’t take me long to figure out the setting of the scene. And that each was a different person. After reading the entire thing a third time to really let the words sink in I got entire body chills when reading about the blood stains on your sisters bathroom floor. It brought back vivid memories of my own.  

I’m not a poetry pro. And I’ve never really critiqued anyone else’s writing before since my own is just my scattered thoughts. But I wouldn’t change a line. The subject that it’s based on may not be for everyone & may not be well understood by anyone without prior experience in the subject. But I like that it stood out to me for that very reason. Lured in by the thought of a man talking to himself in a ward about the pain & anguish he caused to another form of life other than a human. Maybe he wasn’t so crazy because the empath in me heard that flower cry as well <3

Besides they were right ya know, about normal being a setting on a washing machine. There’s nothing “normal” about life, or how a persons mind processes those experiences. While some are afraid of dying others are afraid of living. I think your words brought your own? experience to life beautifully. Thank you for having the courage to write it!"

I mean honestly even if you hate them you it’s because you actually love them & probably just got hurt. Doesn’t change the base emotion. 

But this love for my person....it’s different. Like I won’t repress it. It’s more than friendship love, or just loving someone, but less than infatuation or obsession, but not the same as being in love. Fml. I just can’t explain it.  It’s definitely loyalty though."

UnsentLetters,f84vh59,t1_f84krua,1574261687.0,"To answer your first question, because it still belongs to someone else. It wouldn’t be fair to give half of a crumbled broken heart to someone. Nor would it make for a stable healthy relationship. 

To answer your second question, I’m afraid of repeating the past. The same mistake over & over again. Of not being fully healed & not recognizing that the next person doesn’t really care either. That they’re just using me for something. Or that I will never be “enough” or good enough for them to love me enough to keep me. 

So right now I’m doing my own inner healing work. Make a truce with my demons. And hopefully whoever is waiting on me is doing the same. Because I don’t ever want to go through this again. I don’t know if I have it in me."
UnsentLetters,f84upqn,t1_f84rouh,1574261164.0,"Me too. I talked to my kids about it a year or 2 ago. And at first they were like “no, I’m keeping my body parts when I die”.... then when we discussed it more in depth they changed their minds & agreed that if anything happens (heaven forbid/knock on wood or some voodoo non sense) to them that they would want to donate as well.  While it’s a morbid subject I feel that more parents should have this conversation & know their children’s decision. Life happens. Death happens. And if one death could save multiple lives then it’s worth discussing. And it doesn’t even have to be morbid & sad or scary. You could make it seem like a superhero power. Just my 2 cents."

Paydays are 2x a month & I honestly tend to forget about them until I get the text from my bank about direct deposit. There’s really nothing unusually stressful about any particular day of the week.

You can see it however you want. Like I said I’ve been there. If you know that you’re being abused and you choose to stay than that’s a choice you made. I’m not victim shaming because I know it’s more than difficult to leave sometimes. But if you’re not trying or have no plan to leave then how can you say “I’m a victim.” ? It’s more like saying “I’m making bad life choices & pretending I have no control over my own decisions & l want people to feel sorry for me”. Because honestly life is exactly what you make it. You can play the victim forever or you can make a conscious decision to change your life & go after what you deserve. I don’t care what excuses you throw out there because I’m sure I’ve used them all. “But we have kids together.  He’s really a great guy underneath it all. I have no where else to go.” ALL OF THEM. They’re still excuses to put the blame on someone other than yourself for making the conscious decision to stay in a shitty, toxic, abusive relationship."

UnsentLetters,f60gu41,t1_f5zywpr,1572616884.0,I see how you can call it victim blaming. But I’ve been the “victim” in a similar situation and I chose to leave the toxic comfort zone of that relationship. You can’t really be the victim if you keep putting yourself in that situation.

UnsentLetters,f5ziket,t1_f5ya91x,1572577807.0,Yup. This. Sometimes I feel that sticking with comfortable toxic is just cowardly.

Weird I know but I’ve been in a long term relationship since I was 17 & there was no dating because we met at a party. And since being single I haven’t really met anyone that seems worthy of taking me on a date. Not to sound stuck up or narcissist but I’ve had plenty of people try & they just didn’t meet my standards I guess? I don’t want to settle so I guess I don’t feel like entertaining anyone who doesn’t check most of my boxes. Anyways... I’ve always been a bit of an introvert, shy & I have lots of anxiety. So I’m not only learning more about myself in the time that I’m waiting, but I’m also learning to be more independent than I already am by doing everything alone. And yesterday I took myself out on a date that I’ve been wanting to do for a long time. It was something that someone else had offered to do as a first date & it never happened. So I went & enjoyed myself & met some new people. And now I kinda want to take myself on more dates. I’m freaking amazing lol"

SuicideWatch,exsaejh,t3_ctz0mq,1566537593.0,Yes. I think I’ve always known that I’ll likely never get married. And it’s not because nobody wants me or I’m ugly or I’m gross or anything like that. It’s because I refuse to settle. And I have been asked to get married before by someone I was in a long term relationship with & had kids with them. I said no because I knew that I didn’t want to spend my life with them. The only time I ever considered getting married to someone was my last long term relationship & that was only really in the beginning/middle. Until I realized years later that they were one big charming red flag of narcissistic lies. I still loved them but knew it would never work. So now I’m in my mid thirties & I’m highly aware that it’ll probably never happen for me. I’m not even sure if I’m sad about it anymore or not. It just is what it is.
