I've always thought what's the point in living and working to have money to be able to live to be able to work.. so on but I think that's just depression speaking, I'd love to have a hard working but good paying job to have the money to spend on my hobbies and interests but having interests and living feels so hard when I hate my body and how I have to live/act. I wish I was born the opposite gender so much but I've always thought that there's nothing I can really do about it and even now knowing that there's kinda a whole community of people feeling the same way it still feels almost impossible to be myself but I guess everyones experience is different but chances are if I'm an egg you are too"

SuicideWatch,ezymka1,t1_ezy1tb5,1568270799.0,"I don't really recall anyone saying that I don't deserve to be alive but maybe I missed that, but it doesn't really bother me that everyone is sharing their opinion about what they believe in I have my family that constantly tell me that if I need help then pray, so it's nothing new and nothing said to me here in that sense would really affect me much. Also I am ex-christian but I mean I don't like to make a big deal about it but I'll have a look at some point, looks interesting and thanks for standing up for me or someone else who could have been easily manipulated when in such a weak position"

SuicideWatch,ezwynbc,t1_ezwy7la,1568228076.0,Is this a typo? How does he care? People who believe in God are easy to give all the credit on God when anything good happens yet when  good people are dying from cancer and kids die how can you justify that God cares?
