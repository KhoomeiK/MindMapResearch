BPD,f1l1e39,t3_d8p9zw,1569544309.0,How do you explain to a partner that sometimes my feelings for them turn into loathing or nothingness/I cant handle any intimate contact? I can feel myself cringing when they try to touch me or just kiss me and I don't know how to put that into words without sounding cold hearted or selfish for not being able to be there with them mentally and psychically 100 percent of the time.
BPD,f1em98s,t3_cvq5ho,1569425413.0,This isn't completely related but I was just recently diagnosed I swore for years I had to be bipolar or something of the sort because I was aware that the things I was doing/ thought/ felt weren't normal especially when it came to the relationship aspect and I know it sounds a bit crazy but God I am so happy there are other people out there who are the same as me i completely identify with this post and I felt like I was an actual sociopath prior it's comforting that other people can relate
