All clothing pieces were made without a pattern, the glasses are made of plastic earrings and wire, and the hat was purchased.

Jacket was made with an old couch slipcover I saved when we got new couches. All other fabric has just been collected over the years

Most of it is sewn but halfway through the day my machine started acting up so the vest is actually just hem taped to the white shirt I made underneath it. üò¨

My husband is both a musician and an incredible audio engineer but has to work a day job because we have kids and he isn't willing to miss their childhood to go  tour constantly.  He continues to make music because he enjoys it and he runs a studio with a partner. We hope some day he can quit his day job, but it just isn't feasible currently."
