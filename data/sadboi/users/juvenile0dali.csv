BPD,fmn7hr8,t3_fqgai6,1586219836.0,"if you find yourself alternating between feeling this way, and being okay with them another time, this is something called splitting. it’s basically switching between being heavily irritated/feelings resembling hatred, and then in the other hand idolizing them, where in your eyes they can do almost no wrong. it’s a common thing with BPD. but if you find these feelings of hurt are more chronic, it may be time to cut this person off. 

i completely relate, i have a tendency to split on those i love and it’s a very hard thing to experience especially when you’re AWARE of it and start to feeling immensely guilty for “disliking” them. 

i would come clean about the things they are doing that have hurt you and explain more of your mental illness, if they react in a malicious way, it is definitely a sign to cut that off."
BPD,fmldg1n,t1_fk1sixu,1586184183.0,"i would heavily recommend going to your psychiatrist with these suspicions and getting a professional confirmation. with that proper diagnosis, they will be able to direct you onto the path of specialized therapy and medication that can help you manage your symptoms better. i understand your viewpoint on not wanting the diagnosis because it IS a heavily stigmatized disorder, but those who are willing to work with you regardless of your spreadsheet will be the ones that are worth getting the help from. they’re out there. :) 

10/10 recommend DBT. i wasn’t able to finish my course of therapy but it helped a lot when i was in it. 
also, stay away from people who don’t take the time to understand what has made you this way. you aren’t crazy. you’re human, who was dealt a rough hand of cards. you can get better and manage this. it’s not easy, but very possible. best of luck. xx"
BPD,fmlcs5m,t3_ffqk6k,1586183795.0,"when my psych first diagnosed me with BPD and explained to me the quiet and classic forms, i personally took it in the sense that us quiet folk have the same intensity of emotion and impulsivity, i feel as though we just may be a bit more self aware and tend to unleash it within ourselves rather than on others or the environment? a controlled chaos, if you will, idk. with classic people, it’s more of a inherent personality thing. maybe it’s dependent on the fact of whether you’re more introverted or extraverted and that that could determine how you express and handle the waves of this mental illness."
BPD,fmlc6aq,t3_fh2drc,1586183431.0,holy shit. i didn’t know others felt this same way too??

BPD,fjfvjce,t3_f91vmp,1583301516.0,"DAE go through phases of like, constantly seeking affection of all forms: physical, sexual, emotional, etc. and almost DEPENDING on it, but then also going through times where any contact makes you sick to your stomach? where you almost feel suffocated and nauseous whenever people are wanting to make contact with you (be it a hug, trying to talk about issues, kissing, sex) and you just want to crawl out of your skin and flee?"
