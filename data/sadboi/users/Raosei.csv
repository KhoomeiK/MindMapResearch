Today, I don't know why but she made such a fuss for no reason and refused to eat dinner that we specially ordered from the eatery nearby (it was chilli crab) and saying that my mother doesn't care about her?? I think it's bc we were unable to have our usual family reunion for mother's day bc of the lockdown. 

 She has absolutely no reason to say that, especially after how she abandoned her family when my mum was a child and then coming back to acceptance. I never even knew such a thing had ever happened because my mum and uncles treat her well and always tells me to respect her. 

And even after that, my mum kept aside some food for her and told my dad not to say bad things about her.

So I really hate when grandma has tantrums like that and it makes my heart ache for my mother and uncles that their mother doesn't seem to appreciate what they do for her.
