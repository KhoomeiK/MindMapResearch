It is odd to be well over 60 and in need of a roommate or two.  I knew nothing about the area or how to find a roommate.  My daughter showed me something on the computer.  Don't think it was Craig's list, it was a big college town and I think it was something more local to the area.  So I wrote an ad that I was over 60 and was in town to be with my newly wed daughter as she underwent cancer treatment.   Her apartment was very small and her and her husband did not need an extra person.  I hoped to be able to stay through her treatments, but I would like a month to month, as I estimated my stay to be six months or less.  Clean, quiet person.    I sent my information to several people and received polite but negative reply's.

I was a college kid once myself... my head would have exploded at the thought of a 65 year old person as a roommate - I got it, believe me.   I even got a response of \[\[ ""How Dare You"" post such lies you evil person. You're what's wrong  and make renting a nightmare.""\]\]   This ad had mentioned they were 420 friendly.... I thought that meant gay and don't see that as any of my business, but figured if it came up I'd tell them I was too old for any shenanigans.  Finally, a positive reply, a young man about 29, said he was desperate to move out of his mothers place, but needed a roommate... 3or4 months would be great.    He was the best roommate I could have asked for.  I'm still in regular contact, tells me he loves me and misses me all the time...I think I was the granny he didn't have.

Alabama,f21znin,t3_dbhvpy,1569878960.0,"They are elected officials - we used to have a ""dynasty"" in this county.   I moved here about 45 years ago - first ran into the sheriff in a Wal-Mart.   After church mode - he was wearing just a white shirt and black pants... I stayed near where he was perusing some items ... in case he was lost, and waited for his mom or guardian to come collect him.  I thought  ""how wonderful that they take this guy into public"".   His disheveled appearance and features, made him appear severely mentally handicap.   Between him and his dad, they held on for 40 years, before Jr. lost an election to someone he had groomed.   We haven't had much luck since then either."

Shocking how much ""dust"" is in the air - or not, house is 130+ years old.    I have never experienced any fan getting warm, using the cheap green filters.  Peak pollen season (doors and windows mostly closed) I have had to change the filter before a month has passed.  If your fan gets warm, you are using the wrong filter."

AskReddit,f1qywbb,t1_f16mwji,1569708738.0,"Not my case either ;  But I remember this from just before I retired in 90.  I'm foggy now about details.  Seems we were tracking about 57 of them country wide - back then it was a shocking number.  That one... seemed to be running I-75.  Almost certainly had to be an owner operator.  Conjecture - placed the bodies in sleeping bags, and stored them in a refrigerated unit /  semi trailer and traveled the I-75 corridor.  Stray women / runaways looking for a ride at a truck stop, no one noticed when they disappeared.  A body in a sleeping bag would turn up along side I-75 thawing out... unknown date of death.  I drove a flatbed for a few months after I retired and I thought about this case a lot.  I always wondered if (before he passed away) Dr. Bass added a freezer unit to the body farm.  I guess I could look, just a good bit of stuff faded in my head and I want to keep it that way."

I'm going to edit this - it's a month later, I want to clarify that I bought an item from a husband and wife pastor team ... when I picked it up, they had switched it out for one ruined and stripped down."

As in this case, they can face criminal charges for other crimes..... but Stolen Valor is strictly punishable under military law.   Seems like a couple years ago there were people on thew internet that hunted these people down... but again.... there was an assumption that it was a law for everyone.  I've looked and there is nothing... A civilian can pose as a retired service member, for monetary gain..... and no one cares.    You just have no idea how much I wish someone would prove me wrong."
