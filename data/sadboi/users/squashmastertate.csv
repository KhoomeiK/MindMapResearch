I'm BP1 and going through something similar at school. People invalidate/stigmatize mental health all the time. Even though my bipolar experiences are a huge reason I want to become a trial lawyer and work in the Mental Illness docket, I can't mention it in a cover letter because they'd probably throw the resumé away. After months of covert searching I found a couple lawyers/judges who are bipolar and that's been really, really nice. People disbelieve them as well, but the fact is we're all over the map. 
  
I wish more your support network would validate what you have, especially your doctor. But it starts with you. Don't take that ""you're not struggling because you have success"" bullshit because you're succeeding despite your struggles. That's something to celebrate. I can't help but disbelieve this ""watered down"" diagnosis based on the information you gave; you're bipolar or you're not. I don't think it's any more complicated than that.

Being bipolar is a lot like being a canary in a mine. Bipolar people are sensitive to things neurotypical people just aren't affected by.

I feel like I'm always the Kelly in friendships and relationships, and Darryl's complete immunity to someone else's toxic behavior just completely baffles me. The issue is that these characters we watch on television are *characters*. We don't know the intimacies of their lives like we know ours. What we're doing is blowing up the criticisms we have of ourselves and letting them wash over our ""cool"" moments because we, on some level, are choosing to do that.
