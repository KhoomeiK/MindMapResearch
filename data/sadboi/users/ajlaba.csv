There is no cure, there are meds and therapies, I tried meds and it didn't work and I won't try out therapy cause the only doctor I know in my country who knew about the disease probably already passed away and my symptoms are too severe and connected with my mental illnesses, neither medical or psychological help will help. I went to 5 different specialists and nobody understood me. My illness doesn't cause me pain but if affects some parts of body, I feel it and it makes a normal life absolutely impossible. I'm lucky cause others have very severe pain. I would describe the illness as a mix of tourette and chronic pain. Probably less than half of a percent of doctors have ever heard of it and approximately 5 or less percent of the world's population suffer from it. Many commit suicide. 

I'm very smart and have great potential but this whole thing makes it impossible to achieve anything. What hurts the most is that I can't talk about it openly cause what's the point if even specialists don't know what's going on with my body? It's a nightmare."
