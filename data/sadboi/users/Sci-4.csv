To stay on topic, we are all selfish. The one committing suicide performs the selfish act of permanently ending the pain, often to the very real expense of those around them, (spreading more pain and confusion). The people demanding the social remain here in pain (often only to avoid a sense of loss within themselves), while never truly taking the time to hear them or help them, are also all selfish. Selfishness is natural to a degree. It's only when judgement is applied, that it becomes a problem. 

Those living in the darkness might benefit from practicing the art of self-observation (myself included). This includes realizing we are not the enveloping darkness we experience, nor the emotions we develop as a result. Rather we are something else entirely. What I've seen that to be, so far while doing my own work, is fascinating at least. This work is a part of what I've recently learned to be called shadow work.

Those surrounding the suffering may do well to practice compassion and patience. Perhaps nothing more? They owe us nothing. We should expect nothing from them. So perhaps nothing at all and instead, maybe it's on us to check our own expectations of others. This community of ours is immensely unique, and filled with hidden advantage, in that we all are so familiar with suffering. I see so much compassion in these forums because WE KNOW how it feels. Maybe that's the trick to this whole thing... We know our sickness so it's up to us to do our own 'dirty' work if we actually hope to feel something different from the misery we all seem to endure so much. Or if you like the misery (I used to and wouldn't about this to myself for some time), simply stay where you are. No judgement here.

Or maybe I assume people really want help here and actually don't so I'm in the wrong place and need to travel somewhere more mentally pleasant? Either way, I wish you all well faring towards whatever you want.

Peace (inner*).

P.S. if you have someone in your life who is toxic, and has you thinking there's something wrong with you, fuck them very much. Start living YOUR life. If you're too young or for whatever reason dependent on a toxic person, have patience and learn where their own toxicity stems from.. Once you understand their motivations, there will be an immediate decline of how much their actions affect you. There will come a time when you will get your freedom papers, and believe me, you want as little baggage for that journey as possible. Good luck. Oh and if you ever feel like talking, HMU. I'm always down to help a fellow traveler, just give me some time if I don't respond right back (notifications are turned off but I usually check in once or twice a day)."

SuicideWatch,fk2zfqb,t1_fk2vdmr,1583813052.0,"A common theme I hear throughout this forum more often than not is those who have a desire to do good before they check out. I wonder, if your life is otherwise meaningless, why not dedicate the rest of it to helping others? We can both agree that the world is filled with pain to the brim, I'm sure... Could you imagine if just one more person decided to smile in the face of depression, in confident defiance, and choose to spread some good to another person? We might have less depression. Well... Maybe anyway...

People, I'm convinced that most of us here don't really want to die. What we really want is to end the pain we feel from this psychotic abomination of what used to be society... If we looked around, we might collectively notice a lack of community... Simple humane decency substituted by a cold, unfeeling attachment to a few ounces of shiny glass, plastic, and silicone that has been honest to deliver constant bursts of instant gratification. We're all sick in the head and we haven't quite been able to put a finger on it so we look for ways to cope, drugs: there's an app for that, tv: several apps, sex: just swipe and get a ride at your beconed call to and from... We've long-since severed our connection to true spiritual health, then physical through poor nutrition and sedentary habits...There's a heavy price that we have to pay for severing the last connection to what makes us human and that's real meaningful interaction with one another. No wonder we're all dolled with misery. We can sense it but haven't a clue what to do about it... Well to anyone reading, I'll tell you what to do about it. Get out and ask someone, anyone if there's any help they need with something. We can start social challenges that either suffocate, poison, or crack the back of a skull... Is it IMPOSSIBLE for us to challenge one another to simply do some small kind gesture for a stranger? Even if it's just a conversation..

Whether we want to admit it or not... The vast majority of us align ourselves to love at our deepest selves. I'd go so far as to say that we each are love incarnate... Why else would there be so many hurt people who still want to help people in this community? You want to feel loved? Fine, go be the life you want to feel. You want to feel appreciated? Get up and do something that's worth appreciation. Obviously, I'm passionate (and admittedly on my soap box) but I'm hitting too... And still want to help. But I've learned through all this that we become what we focus on the most. You want a better reality? Take ownership of your God-given ability to create your reality. It won't be overnight.. No. But, whether good or bad, a thought can become an idea, an idea can become an action, an action to a habit, habits to lifestyle and lifestyle to life. It's on us as individuals to choose what it's gonna be. 

Please don't kill yourself, you obviously have the spark of potential. If you do nothing but good in 72 hours, what could you do with a weeks time? A month? You are loved and you are love. Lift your head up and make a move that really matters. To hell with all the world bullshit. I know you can."

Is your dread stemming from a situation (or combination of many)? If not, then is it perhaps a chemical instance? Hormonal? Even our gut bacteria play a role in our emotional state... Maybe it's a matter of repeating the same hurtful thought processes? We can learn depression... Most of us actually practice it without knowing it (and get damn good at it in fact). It's the judgements we place on our thoughts and feelings that keep us trapped in them by giving them weight. Remove the judgement, lighten the load so to speak.
