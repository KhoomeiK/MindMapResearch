mysteriesoftheworld,fi8kqiw,t3_f717np,1582242453.0,"Reminds me of one of the buildings I went into during service. In that case it had two purposes, underground it was a bunker for disaster preparation but the upper portion wasn't going to be put into use until we got everything set up there (I think it ended up becoming a regular commercial building). Can't see the roads in the picture, but if there are any tunnels nearby they probably enter through there. It's rather common, usually we prepare a few outside major cities."

ptsd,fe6mhye,t1_fe6htcm,1578895963.0,"Is Alzheimers a disease? No bacteria causes that. I have PTSD and became obsessed with studying it, which led to me studying other diseases that share its tendencies and area of effect. Diseases are caused by (generally) 1 of 3 things: pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc.), genetic conditions, or inciting events. If a coal miner gets black lung due to his work in the mines, he contracted a disease that was not genetic nor caused by any organism. So, he ended up getting it due to the event, location, and actions involved in the circumstances (sound familiar?). If a woman that works in a chemical factory comes into contact with acidic chemicals, she could potentially get acidosis because of it. Obviously something causes it, but blame is not a good way of putting it. It's not like someone released it as a biological weapon. Cancer is a disease, non transmissible. The flu is a disease, highly transmissible. I'm plenty well educated on diseases due to my CBRN training in the military, so I'd be interested in hearing where your education came from. Regardless, this seems like a knee jerk reaction that could have been avoided via a little bit of research before trying to argue. I harbor no ill will to your statement, but ignorance of our own condition can not lead to good things."
ptsd,fe3avtn,t3_eno6xw,1578847650.0,"Man, I'm still tryna remember the exact details of the shit I've went through. Don't feel bad or guilty about it, it's a long and arduous process. If your parents disrespect you for small shit, odds are you're thinking about the past correctly. Hang in there bud, I believe in you"

ptsd,fdzt55z,t3_enbnf0,1578795192.0,"I accidentally grabbed my girlfriend and pinned her on the floor after she touched my stomach as I was sleeping. That was when I had to explain to her that I had an enemy combatant try to stab me in the stomach (she already knew I had PTSD), which she was thankfully very understanding of. It kinda makes me feel like I can't even enjoy human interaction sometimes. Stay strong bud, we'll get through this. This Sub is filled with a lot of good people that wanna help, and it's helped me understand how civilians experience PTSD, which has actually helped me realize that I'm not just broken or a monster. Keep up, we'll make it out the other side just fine"

ptsd,fdwvol2,t1_fdwn47q,1578762795.0,"I fail to see how it's demeaning. Just how I can't judge every father in the world based off of my own experiences, I think it's counterproductive to assume that all medical facilities are this bad due to one experience. PTSD is not an easy condition to have and getting proper help and treatment for it and other ailments that stem from a fractured nervous system is important. I believe that painting medical facilities with such a large brush will cause others struggling with this affliction to be unjustly afraid of getting any treatment whatsoever. I used to be terrified because I heard people talking like this and I went two years without going to any doctor whatsoever because of it, so I might be a bit biased. It would not be fair or right of me to say that all muslims should do this or that because a few killed some of my close friends, becausesuch broad generalizations do nothing but cause fear and distrust. All I did was disagree with a generalization, and if that makes me a bad person then label me all you want. I tried to end my opinion on a supportive note."
ptsd,fdo85d1,t1_fdo556v,1578600551.0,"I do understand considering how you said it was a rant immediately. I also understand what it's like to be abused by those who's job is to protect, my father abused me and left me to rot when I was young. Please do not assume what I do and don't know. You left an opinion with an experience and I left the same. Agression will not help either one of us live our lives better, and neither will assumptions. My goal was not to diminish your experience, but to maybe help someone who might be scared when simply explaining might help the circumstances. PTSD is terrifying, and anything that might help is worth saying."
ptsd,fdo4goo,t1_fdo3ndm,1578598726.0,I'm sorry you feel that way. Seems like the facilities you've went to are just shitty.
ptsd,fdnlwzz,t3_emapgp,1578588540.0,"There's nothing shameful about PTSD. Your nervous system has been pushed to a near breaking point, and now this is our life. I don't agree that every doctor should require extensive training, that's not their job. Rather, it's our responsibility to inform them we have it so they know to be upfront and honest. I almost fought a doctor after a tray fell and brought me right back to combat. The nurses knew exactly what to do and say. They grounded me, reminded me where I was and that they were just going to try to help me. People are usually understanding if you take the time to make sure you're understood. I've seen a lot of shit, but my belief in the goodness of average people has never failed me in harsh situations. Your life isn't worth less because of anything. We are survivors, and that's what we'll have to be to get through this. Hang in there bud, we got this"

ptsd,ep9ss3z,t1_ep9ok9j,1559115604.0,"The same way you learn a new hobby. Controlled risks to determine what helps and what doesn't. Every mind is different and reacts differently. Try starting out by weighing the pros and cons of ONE thing you're worried about at the moment. Forget your emotions about it, and look at it objectively. Does your partner help you whenever you're down, has your back, and pushes you to do good things, with very few minor drawbacks and no major drawbacks? Don't fuck with the situation, and just acknowledge that you're gonna be uncomfortable as things get better. Always be hopeful and authentic with yourself, and you'll slowly start to become better at handling that self defeating habit."
ptsd,ep935cm,t3_bu9bg8,1559103659.0,"PTSD causes your mind and body to always be on high alert. To a large extent, chaos becomes a home. If things are getting better, your mind is probably uncomfortable with it and is freaking out. Things are getting worse mentally BECAUSE things are getting better situationally, as counterintuitive as it sounds. Take this advice from somebody who wishes they would've heard it sooner: don't let your situation worsen because it scares you. Focus on the people close to you and accept your new life fully."
ptsd,eonsmac,t1_eons2sx,1558720540.0,"A buddy of mine actually got mild PTSD symptoms from a bad trip. If you don't already have PTSD, use those two responsibly and you should be safe-ish. If you start going through a rough patch in your life, make sure to cut back on use or cut it out all together for that time. Weed and Psychedelics have good medical uses, but can worsen a situation that might cause mental problems. So, be safe when using, don't overuse, and avoid stress during use. That should be enough to prevent most of the risk."
ptsd,eonrv7h,t3_bsjtyp,1558720009.0,"Most research suggests that certain genetic traits, such as a smaller hippocampus, can result in an increased risk of PTSD. It does not have an inherently genetic trigger though, so as long as you don't go through something horrifying (like combat or abuse), you're probably okay."
