mentalhealth,fb2vh4p,t3_eawvd1,1576458479.0,"Hello,


I used to work at a mental health crisis residence and found that some ER nurses would try to push their patients onto us in order to make space for new patients - even if they were not experiencing a psychiatric crisis (I remember one instance of the hospital sending a client to us without telling us before we had completed a screening with this individual) Many of our clients would tell us horror stories of their own or from people they know regarding psychiatric care in hospital settings. In fact, when I complete a crisis/safety plan through my current job (ARMHS worker) my clients are asked to list a preferred hospital when we update their paperwork each year. 

I like the idea of community-based care, where individuals can receive care and live as independently as possible outside of a hospital setting, through intensive community based supports. 

I’m curious about the insights of others and what others have experienced or heard.

Thanks!

Jonathan W"
