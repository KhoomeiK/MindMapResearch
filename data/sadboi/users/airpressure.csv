IAmA,fon85xk,t1_fokojlv,1587914314.0,"I have BPD and went through the DBT programme and graduated. I loved individual sessions, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy group sessions. I didn‚Äôt find it beneficial - often times people would talk about things that would trigger me, sometimes I‚Äôd come in a good mood and someone else was sitting there crying the entire time, sometimes people would storm out of the room. I felt like it kinda made things worse at times. 

The group coordinators and my own psychologist told me that the group is probably the most important component of DBT. I tried to tell them that I don‚Äôt think that therapy is a one size fits all thing, and I truly believe that group therapy just isn‚Äôt beneficial for some people. I got told I was being wilful. 

I hope that eventually they do start to tailor DBT therapy to ones‚Äô individual needs. 

In saying this, I did learn some good skills from the group but I definitely feel like I benefited more from individual therapy, and I am definitely living better a life and am able to deal with difficult situations in healthier ways."
AskReddit,fon4m8g,t3_g88ccd,1587912115.0,"When I was nine I woke up because I heard a weird noise. Not really knowing what it was what I was , I turned my light on. I didn‚Äôt see anything out of the ordinary, but I often had nightmares, so I went to my dads room and told him I was scared. 

The next morning we noticed that our laundry window had been pried open and our rubbish bin was underneath it, I think I startled someone breaking into our house, so they just left. 

We had been robbed only a few weeks before when we weren‚Äôt home, but they didn‚Äôt take any of our computers, but took pretty much everything else that was of value. We think they were coming back for the computers. That‚Äôs scary in itself because within that week we had switched the study with my bedroom and they probably would‚Äôve headed to my room first."

BPD,foej3gz,t3_g70ov2,1587705099.0,I have been feeling this way a lot lately. Not just that - some people feel like they can treat you in a not-so-nice way and if you get upset about it (like anyone would BPD or not) they don‚Äôt take any responsibility for the way they behaved. It‚Äôs like they think it‚Äôs a free pass to treat you badly. Idk my personal experience

BPD,f1gxrav,t3_d9fpzo,1569480729.0,"I used to, my mindset has changed a lot. If I were to write out some peoples' problems on a piece of paper along with my own, a lot of the time my problems would seem a lot more extreme. However, you have to realise that everything is subjective for each and every individual. 

If someone's worst problem is the equivalent to the least of yours, that doesn't mean that their problems are less than yours, that just means they have a different scale and measure of pain. To them, their worst problem may feel just as bad as yours does, because they can only compare it to their worst experience.

I think being upset with other people for their seemingly ""trivial"" issues is more of a reflection of how you're feeling on the inside, and it's definitely something to work on.

I used to feel the same way, but reminding myself of the above puts things into perspective for me. People are people, everyone is human, and pain is pain. Showing compassion not only serves the person you're having empathy for, it helps yourself, your soul, and your own healing."
