SuicideWatch,eu6ofts,t3_cf1zzo,1563505024.0,"I understand, I've done the same thing except with another substance. I stopped not by choice and I've missed it ever since. I tell myself I shouldn't try and there are high risks but I've lost any friends I had. I was happier when I used. And having someone say that to you and disregard what you've done and your struggle is a slap in the face. You're going great and I'm proud of you for taking the steps to quit and admit you have a problem. There will always be moments like this but hopefully it gets better. We'll be ok one day even with these moments"

depression,etjp8ag,t1_etfes4y,1562878403.0,"I'm extremely poor. If I were to loose my job is be homeless almost immediately. I just moved away from a toxic family. I can't afford to move or relocate once I just did. Where I loved had a larger gay community but I had no one to go anywhere with and because I was dealing with emotional abuse I wasn't able to make very many friends. I moved in hopes things would get better and thus far it's only gotten better in that I'm away from abuse. I'm still left with my traumas and inability to make friends. I want to be who I am it's just hard. I'm nonbinary and bisexual, most people invalidate me within the community let alone outside of it so I stay closeted. I am not mentally stable enough to come out I already have nothing I don't need nothing and public ridicule and being outcasted more than I am"
depression,etjoom3,t1_etg8x65,1562878064.0,"Yea, I'm not trying to be one dependant on someone I don't even know if my personality would allow that, I just want someone I know will be there if I need them and someone I can be there for. We don't have to talk everyday or anything I just want someone to care"
depression,eteyvgh,t1_eteokjw,1562753519.0,"Thank you this helps a lot, I've never had good family relationship or friend relationship so I don't really know what they're supposed to be like. In my mind not being open is why I don't have friends so maybe I over extend when I find someone who might be my friend. I am also in the LGBT+ community, I like rap music, drag, and care about about political activism for human rights. I usually don't put this all out there and when I talk about interests with others they seem off put. Where I live there isn't much of a gay community.  I'm also have sever depression and anxiety and I think I push people away as soon as someone does one thing that I see as a sign of future conflict. Like one ""friend"" who we got along but the whole interrupting me, never listening to what I say, I would hear what they say and care but it never felt reciprocated. Then they did something they knew I wouldn't like because I told them it's hard for me to talk to people because I'm private and don't want everyone to know my business. So they told someone in my family (that I don't get along with) a deeply personal thing that I was struggling through. We really have talked once since then. I don't know if this is a good trait or a bad one but it's hard to criticize myself because I'm overly critical and can't tell if it's just my mental illness or if I'm right."

depression_help,et5jpn0,t1_et52j2x,1562476379.0,"When I was in school I felt the same way. You should ask your parents if they would be able to put you into actual therapy. No school guidance teacher therapy. They never cared about what I had to say when I was in school so I would be unsuprised if it was the same.

But she is right it isn't your problem to worry about but that's doesn't mean you won't. You're young and it must be hard to witness suck pain all the time. You are young and things really stick with you at that age. You're pain is real and you're allowed to be sad and have these feelings for your brother. You should tell him that you love him and/or care about him and hope he can not be so depressed eventually but understand it might not be something anyone else can control and you're not responsible for his pain."
depression_help,et5ipn1,t3_ca2obm,1562475395.0,"I am in similar boat other than yours is more stressful than mine is since I have no children. I'm  sorry you're going through this as someone with a lower version of your stress this is how I've always processed my emotions and I can tell you for a fact it's unhealthy and when things get overwhelming (if they do) it will come back to bite you. I moved away from my toxic family to be happy and things haven't been all I head hoped they had been. The last 6 years I've spent trying to move away any issues I've had I've put into a box to fix when I had the time, energy, and safe space. 
When I finally did what I've been working towards and nothing is turning out perfect. I'm the sole breadwinner, no family, no friends, shitty job that's killing me physically and draining. I wish I had gone to therapy and delt with me emotions and traumas as they happened. They've just been unleashed on everyone around me now and I feel clinically alone. 
Please even if you're not good at it at first and you don't think it's helping or you don't know what you're doing at least try. Go to therapy sometimes and spend some time set aside to think about your feelings and right them down, even if you don't know what to write or if you think it's pointless. If you don't start to unbuild all of that trauma and stress you will become like be 6 years deep in unprocessed emotion with nowhere to go. You can do this even if it seems hard to stupid or overwhelming it's better to start before you're in to deep.
Maybe your wife can help you process some of it but I understand not wanting to stress her out or being uncomfortable talking to people. I use a diary app on my phone and input when I'm feeling really low and don't know how to stop. I also use a mood tracker to track my moods throughout the day. Or I try to anyway."
SuicideWatch,es7pk1c,t3_c68ql2,1561676403.0,"Honestly, it feels like if I ever finally go through with it people will be like ""oh we never saw it coming"" ""she was so important to us and we loved her"" but no one talks to me unless j talk to them first. It pisses me off thinking about people who would take my suicide and use it as something to make themselves look better. They don't care now. They know I'm suicidal but no one actually cares. Not till I go through with it"
confession,es7pd48,t1_es6qzu8,1561676263.0,Someone close to me is schizophrenic. It's not romanticized to me. I know what it's like I'm just tired of having any responsibility for myself. Everything seems to.much and it feels like I'll never be happy. What's the point of doing anything if nothing gets better. I'd rather be drugged up and have no pressure eto do anything than go on
