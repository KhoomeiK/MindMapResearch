This is a point im trying to get acrossed.

Everyone who has issues. Bullies,addicts,gamblers,greedy people defend their reasoning.  You can notice something is wrong,but they wont change their,thats because their judgment is clouded.

I listed the pros and cons of sex. The con list  surpasses the pro list.  Its like a gambling addict saying he doesnt have any issue.  Everyone is gambling. I have control over my spending.
