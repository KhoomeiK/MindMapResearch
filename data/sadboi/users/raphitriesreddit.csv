depression,f3152b1,t3_dezigp,1570568193.0,"Oh yeah it totally happens, because every obstacle or inconvenience becomes so much bigger and harder to go through. It makes things so frustrating personally bc it doesnâ€™t feel like people get my state, or understand how much of a struggle everything is.

depression,f16mghk,t1_f16co34,1569216821.0,"It depends from a person to the other but my first two did cause significant weight gain. Mirtazapine was the one that made me gain weight the most, since its side effects are weight gain and increased appetite. I went from eating 2-3 meals a day to 5-6! I was constantly hungry! Zoloft was calmer but I gained weight from a poor diet. But again all of this varies from one person to the other, their dieting and life habits and if you work out or not. I definitely suggest talking to a doctor and mentioning what side effects you would like to avoid. As I tried different medications I learned my dealbreakers but itâ€™s best to do some research instead of experiencing it ðŸ˜…. All of mine mention weight gain as a side effect but Trintellix was the one where that side effect had the lowest likeliness of it happening. Hope it helps!"

2meirl42meirl4meirl,etskwff,t3_cd3gaw,1563148317.0,"ok um let's change this around bc this is fucking depressing:

&#x200B;

In case no one told you today:

\- you are never truly alone; there are tons of people in your life who love you

\- you are not expandable, you bring your own unique personality and qualities to this world that is priceless 

\- everyone dies, it's a part of life, but it's nothing to be scared of

\- you won't be forgotten, you will live in the memories and hearts of those who care about you

\- although you will be forgotten in like 200 years, and then it will be like you never existed, it won't change the fact that you walked, lived, laughed, loved and cried on this earth. You have had, currently have and will have an impact on other's lives and your life is worth living.

&#x200B;

sorry for being corny af I was just triggered as someone with mental health issues and can't imagine someone seeing this and being triggered too so I wanted to spread some positivity, have a good day."
BreakUps,etlzup2,t1_etlzro8,1562948983.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry that happened, itâ€™s heartbreaking when you concede and do so much effort but the other doesnâ€™t. I really hope the best for you and a quick recovery :("
BreakUps,etlz42b,t3_cca2yi,1562948522.0,"Itâ€™s never a sudden thing, there are signs. Some people just arenâ€™t able to communicate it. In my case I had clearly told my ex what was wrong many times throughout the months and told him what breached my trust and when I saw no changes I fell out of love with him and let him go. It happens but itâ€™s never oneâ€™s fault or a scheme itâ€™s a hard decision to do."
