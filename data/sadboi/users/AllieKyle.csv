TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fqtxr3v,t3_gklyez,1589648147.0,"I used to struggle with this a lot. I think the secret is channelling that jealousy into something positive. For instance, as a tomboy I always was jealous of girls wearing cute skirts and red lipstick. Turns out it was because I wanted to wear those things too but didn't have the confidence to do so. Jealous of a girl who's got abs? Made me wanna work out! Jealous of how a girl seemed to make friends so easily? Made me wanna work on my social skills. Of course, this can be a struggle sometimes and it's not always perfect but the key is to try and think of something positive that can come of it.   


As for being 'feminine' enough, I don't believe there's such a thing to be honest. If you like yourself and how you act and identify as a woman, you are feminine enough and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. What constitutes as being 'feminine' these days are changing anyway. More androgynous looks are revered for both men and women, for instance.    


I wouldn't be so harsh on yourself. You know there's a problem and you're taking steps to work on it. I wish you luck!"

ACTrade,fqmjfjs,t3_gjoewx,1589478435.0,"Top 3 Fave Shows:  


1. Parks and Rec
2. Derry Girls
3. Doctor Who

Fave/Hate Characters:

1. Favorite is definitely Leslie Knope. She's everything a politician, hell, a working woman should be! Driven, passionate, kind, always willing to think outside the box. I can definitely relate to being accused of being too intense in my morals and beliefs but it's characters like Leslie who remind me that passion is never a bad thing. Hate? Honestly? None. Closest to 'hate' is Mark Brendanawitz, and I don't even hate him. He just has such a 'meh' character in comparison to everyone else.   

2. Michelle is my fave, she's a sassy wildcard who always gets the group into trouble but honestly has huge potential with how fiery she gets! Least fave is probably Jenny Joyce, and I still find her entertaining. The only reason she's my 'least' is because she reminds me too much of privileged people IRL. That being said the actress plays her well and the character is entertaining enough that I don't hate her lmao.  

3. Favorite character? The Doctor, obviously. So many iconic heroes in fiction and the Doctor always tugs at my heartstrings. Kind, smart, a bit crazy, brave, what more could you want? The least favorite is probably...hmm. It's actually a tough call but I'd have to say I liked Martha the least, but that's more because of how the writers wrote her. Instead of being someone who is the Doctor's equal, she just defaults to the lovesick puppy. That being said, her character picked up during the Master Arc!

HOWEVER....now that I think about it this could potentially set up some really interesting character development for her. Insofar, I'd argue Maddy has had the least character development (other than Lexi but it's more or less confirmed Lexi will apparently have a huge role is S2, fingers crossed for her falling in love with Rue!). But this does bring huge potential.  


She's 17 and I knew a lot of people at 17 who were dumb and selfish but had some sort of huge moment that made them grow and be successful and happy. Nate's downfall could be Maddy's rise. It'd be interesting if, for example, Maddy ends up working in a domestic abuse help center or some kind of advocate for young girls. At least I really hope this is the route they'll go."
LittleFiresEverywhere,fq17xmr,t1_fq0xucx,1589042995.0,"I am very much aware of how anti-black Asians can be. Just because you're a POC doesn't make you immune to being a racist. I'm not one of them, but it seems like you already made up your mind about me being this anti-black racist. Meh, I've said what I could but if you insist on painting me as a 'pathetic' racist with 'bullshit' excuses, then so be it. Feel free to think your opinion of me, but I know it isn't true, so that's that.

But to answer your question, I don't complain about the Richardsons' being white because the book made it clear that the Richardsons were meant to be this picture-perfect American dream family. I may have remembered Mia and Pearl's ethnicities wrong and that's my fault (on the subject, had I known that Pearl and Mia were never meant to be asian like I misunderstood obviously I wouldn't have been disappointed that they weren't) but what I do remember very well is that Pearl saw the Richardsons as this perfect family (even though we knew they weren't), but it made sense to have them as this white family because of how cartoonishly perfect they looked in Pearl's eyes. When you're a young POC who grows up in a predominantly white culture, you imagine the perfect family as this blonde barbie housewife, career dad and two kids. This difference made the Warren/Richardson dynamic more interesting."
LittleFiresEverywhere,fpyiv4f,t1_fpx1l6s,1589004660.0,"As I've said the only reason I care was because the Asian culture seems so important and prevalent in LFE. It's the same reason I mind Scarlet Johanson being casted as Mokoto in Ghost in the Shell: yes, her character is a robot, but because Japanese culture is so important in it it makes absolutely no sense to cast a white woman. I would take the same issue if, say, T'Challa in Black Panther was played by a white dude.

By contrast, I don't care that the Little Mermaid is apparently going to star a black woman as Ariel. In fact, I think it's a great idea (and remember reading a post that suggests that, ironically, if mermaids existed they're more likely to have black skin than anything).

I don't see how you think no one attacks when a white person plays a person who is otherwise a POC. As far as I can tell, there's always backlash and for good reason."

It was always frustrating how my mom seemed to look at that show always wanting the same relationship (she wasn't the Nparent but we still had our issues). I kept telling her it's not normal for a mom to be 'best friends' with her daughter and it's in fact, a very immature and unhealthy dynamic. My mom, who was often the type to dump all her problems on me and confide in me for too adult things from a young age, saw nothing wrong with it.  


It's worth noting Rory represents the ideal daughter for most mothers: beautiful, smart, 'mature' (I mean she's meant to be smart and mature in the show but analysing her actions would say otherwise but. I digress) and most importantly, always there to help her mother at the drop of a hat.

LegalAdviceUK,fp06y6d,t3_gagizk,1588203638.0,"Hi! I'm not an expert on the subject and please bare in mind most people who you talk to on here won't be the best legal experts, but I can give you some suggestions to consider? I'd say maybe take a look at the Protection from Harassment Act of 1997 which was also amended in 2012 (the new additions I think were specifically to address cyber stalking concerns), specifically section 2 which prohibits harassment via stalking, causing distress or alarming the person.

Section 2A(2) says that course of conduct can be stalking if it amounts to harassment of that person and the person whose course of conduct it is ought to know it would amount to harassment of the person. A reasonable person would very much argue someone whose income comes from such websites would feel alarmed or in distress if their personal life (such as your FB account) would come into contact in their private working life (your Onlyfans page).

Section 2A(3) listed some examples for stalking and one of it includes statement or material relating to a person, monitoring someone's use of internet/email/any electronic communication. The fact that he actively made the effort to search for you is something to consider, as well as posting your FB pictures.

Section 1(3) does say that the only time courses of conduct won't be considered harassment is if it was done to detect crime (which I'm assuming wasn't the case for you), done under rule of law (again I fail to see why someone of a higher authority would force him to do you) or that his course of conduct was 'reasonable'.

You could also see what the Citizens Advice bureau have to say! If you can't afford a lawyer right now, they have people who can help and they will surely know better than most people on reddit.

I don't know if this helps at all, but please keep us updated on your progress OP. Also some assholes will make you feel guilty for being a sex worker and make you feel like you 'deserve' it. That's utter bs, no one deserves to be threatened like this. Good luck OP, hope this turns out well for you.  


EDIT: OH! I forgot there's also the Computer Misuse Act 1990  that you can take a look at, with its first sections specifying misuse of computers to facilitate commissions of further offences."
