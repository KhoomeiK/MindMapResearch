I don't live in the US btw so have to constantly research US law online

And to add to it we don't know their legal situation. It's just a validation post on reddit anyways. Who cares


He took the responsibility, he realised he could not contribute to the child and decided to not let it ruin his life and communicated to her, She was responsible and took the decision to keep the baby. 

If she was pro life or forced by her parents the same logic can be applied to the guy too maybe he was forced by the parents to put it under the rug.

I'm not cutting anyone slack, I haven't even commented on their characters in my comment. All i said was he has no legal obligation to be involved. Even the payments would be made by parents since he was minor. Until he becomes financially capable of. So 0 legal obligation.

If the guy doesn't want the kid then they have the choice to leave and if the woman doesn't want the kid she can abort it. If the other party disagrees they are under no obligation to be there legally. Unless there is a legally binding document such as divorce pertaining to child support and visitation etc or a marriage involved or she decides to take him to court for child support in which case you will anyway receive a letter



Also he was 16 give that man a break and what's this got to do with OP mentioning she thought he was a feminist. Isn't it about equality to give both the parties involved in a pregnancy the right. Otherwise you leave room for entrapment.




Edit: edit to add to my comment that depending on the state you live in the law might mandate it. We don't know what their legal situation is and how he has defaulted on payments (in case he was binded to) so far, was he ever obligated to since he was a minor. We don't know what the judge ruled at that time. Is his name on the birth certificate etc etc. 

Edit 2: Anyways all of this is irrelevant since the kid is 19 now and if the parents of OP's husband were paying child support till now. Since he's over 18 now there is no legal obligation either.
So even more the OP's husband is under no obligation."

Fox was the first to give him platform early on coz he is a numbers guy and that appeals more to republicans.


Overall republicans are more open to outsiders. Even trump was a registered democrat before he switched and later he realised he had a better chance to get a nomination from republican side. Democratic caucuses and affiliate cities would not vote andrew.


Also he was running for issues faced by republicans more. Truck drivers blue collar jobs etc. UBI has been running in a res state alaska. UBI appeals more to republicans to be shareholders in the state. It makes them patriotic too."

Everything single one of those things is absolutely true

I'm brown, meaning person of color, i am part of multiple ngos that i work with during the weekend. My office supports this.

There isa world outside US. People. Surprise surprise. I have a masters degree in Computer Science and I listen to metal. What is so not believable about it.

What is more creepy is you had the time to stalk my reddit enough to know all this instead of reading what I wrote to discount my opinion. Ad hominem attack.

entertainment,fgedise,t1_fgea9ri,1580697071.0,"The thing is if you are a white male then your opinion is immediately invalidated by the twitter mob types. This has become especially true in the current environment. If as a person anything you say was considered invalid just because of your gender and color of your skin irrespective of the struggles you went through then you are bound to get angry. It's sorta justifiable. (It's how slowly and slowly jewish people were first stopped from a platform, invalidated and then abuse against them was normalised you get what I'm saying right, in the current campuses abuse against a white male is not seen as bad since they are considered privelleged which is a blanket stereotype that's not true of many white men struggling coming from poor families from the midwest with entire communities disrupted by automation and job loss)

&nbsp;

And I say that as a person of color myself.

&nbsp;

Also no one is saying or getting angry that it's getting easier for women to report. It's a good thing and no one argues that point. People are angry about the twitter cancel culture. You do realise twitter is not the way to actually report a crime right. I work on the ground with NGOs and a lot of victims are brave women who have the balls to report to authorities but I seldom see them posting it on twitter and when they do want to it's after they have filled a report and got help and have now become emotionally mature and safe to tackle it head on. before actually. Twitter and the real world differ. It is good for spreading awareness after the fact. Not before for allegations as otherwise it becomes a mob justice where the first one who throws rock wins the public opinion as people seldom revisit things they have formed opinions on. It's why allegation news generate more clicks than real news coming out years later."

*What really constitutes as evil?*

&nbsp;

So all I'm gonna say is humans are innately capable of a lot of evil. There are good and bad sides to every individual. But the manifestation of evil that we call out in retrospect of an individual may not appear that way at the time it happened. One step at a time we do things that might be denying someone else's humanity but we don't realise. The next step we take in that direction we justify based on the previous step. I believe this is how it escalated during the WW2. Ultimately manifesting into something truly evil that we can learn a lesson from. 


&nbsp;


The lesson being that we should never forget the evil that humans _are_ capable of and not let history repeat itself by actually questioning any violations of humanity with our freedom of speech and other mechanisms pit in place. 


&nbsp;


Also we brand certain individuals as evil but truth is they can't be evil 24/7. There has to be some humanity in each unless you're a sociopath. The question is at what point does the bad you do overcomes the good that you did that society needs to come together and put a stop to what you are doing. This all can be very complex and vary from case to case hence we simplify this with laws that need not be violated. This is the true purpose of legislature i believe. To protect us.


&nbsp;


*The true crime then is the deliberate removal of laws that protect people's humanity. Even worse is making new laws that discriminate*


&nbsp;


When an individual tries to achieve this can we truly say he is evil? In my opinion yes. Since they have tried to alter the framework that tries to protect people's humanity. That is the true face of evil. Hence I absolutely agree that Hitler is infact evil. But how do we come to terms with the fact someone evil might have done something good at some point intellectually. I do not know. I'm still too young to understand it."

Games that just rely on story like uncharted etc, i can enjoy for the story but their gameplay isn't fun it's repetitive and the focus is just the story. On the other hand Rockstar gives fun mechanics to engage in an open world while having stories plsy oit while you are practically living in the city, talking to people mantaining multiple relashionships mafia and friends and doing favours for them to reach the top is really amazing. It's like a mafia movie."
