First and foremost.. Get a Kennel. 

Quick guide: (google or dm for details)

Let ur puppy discover the kennel and all the cool stuff inside it.. An occasional treat or toys. Feed Sam (ur dogs name for now) in the kennel and while sam does so u close it. Open it right after sam is done. After a couple of days start closing the kennel for a couple minutes.ONLY open it when sam is quiet. Else sam knows that barking often and loud enough will open it. Extend the time to up to 1hr for now and later mby 2hrs (then i really gotta go out with ur puppy).

Well after every walk u walk ur dog on leash to the kennel and close it. You can give it a kong (very good to make them tired).  Make it a daily routine for ur dog so it will understand ""sleep time"". After a nap ur dog needs to go out immediately to pee.

It worked wonders for me!
I hope that helped and pls make sure u google about kennel training. Theres a lot u can do wrong!"

Generally speaking dogs learn the fastest with positive reinforcement, meaning they lesrn the fastest if u reward positive behaviour. But I have met multiple dog trainers with well trained dogs that told me with positive reinfprcement only u ccant get negative behaviour out od ur floof. So negative reinforcement (generally not recommended) could bring the results u are looking for. E.g. my dog barked a lot. All we had to do was to get a water sprayer and whenever she barked she would get a breeze. Took her like 2 sprays and now whenever she tried to act up all I had to do was to place the sprayer on the table. Complete silence. And now she doesnt need it anymore. (Results may vary)

I understand that this might not be the nicest way to teach a dog so if u don't like it u can teach it ""speak"" and then ""silence"" so all u have to do is to say silence (and reward ur pupper)."
