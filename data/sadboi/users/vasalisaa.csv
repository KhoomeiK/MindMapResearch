My doctors never gave an answer as to what it was and i used to wake up crying because my fingers were so swollen and itchy. I literally thought i was cursed by God (like Lot from the bible) when i was like 6 years old. Holy shit I've lived almost 27 years not knowing the name for this.... wow. Thank you!
