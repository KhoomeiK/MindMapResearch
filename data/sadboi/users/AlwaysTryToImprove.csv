HealthAnxiety,fhy4qsl,t3_f58hef,1581968549.0,"Distractions and reinforcements work for me - positive reward when I resist the urge to google, negative punishments when I did google. For me it was a reward of buying myself something I wanted (candle, chocolate, whatever I wanted) and punishment was not being allowed to watch my favourite programme or read the book I’m enjoying etc (but nothing physical ever please).

Some people wean (spelling?) off it, so decreasing the amount they are allowed to google from 10 times a day, to 5, 3, to 7 times a week, 3 times a week and so on...

It’s also handy to remind yourself when you’re doing it less is ‘how long have I had this? Have I already had reassurance from a doctor about this?’ It helps keep in mind if it’s a momentary symptom, an anxiety symptom or something you should maybe see your doctor about :)"

Abnormal can mean fighting off infection we don’t know about or have symptoms of. She also explains scar tissue on the lymph nodes.

She said you can feel pea or bean sized lymph nodes, they can be hard or rubbery and NOT be dangerous, anything around approx. 1cm is normals, they can swell with illness or injection, sometimes that swelling doesn’t go down or go away etc.

HealthAnxiety,fdif8yo,t3_elhsjs,1578441567.0,"What I did was a combination of two things:

 1) reminding myself that when I would check before with a previous concern I was fine but checking was feeding my anxiety.

I’m also thinking of starting meditation/ breathing exercises/ light physical exercise in order to improve my anxiety, maybe you’d like to join me in some of that?

A natural treatment can be possible, although I assume it depends on the severity of your stress or anxiety. It may take a while to find something that helps you, trial and error, or maybe you’ll find it straight away. You can try meditating, yoga, breathing exercises, mindfulness, something creative, etc. If you don’t find success with any self-help methods talk to your doctor and specify that you want to try therapy/counselling before any drugs (they most likely would prefer this too). Good luck in finding something that works for you."

Anyway when I contacted my GP and told them what the doctor said the GP literally said to me “you don’t need anything, just wait it out I’m sure you’ll be fine”.

I was put on propranolol due to my high heart rate too, except for me it helped me sleep because otherwise my heart rate was racing so much it woke me up.

HealthAnxiety,ez5zaaj,t1_ez2wd02,1567707161.0,"What a truly horrible comment to make, especially from a medical student. Would you approach a person who had suffered a heart attack with the same phrase of “Sorry to ruin the party”? I should certainly hope not and to be frank I would not like to be in your care if this is the kind of rapport you intend to build with patients. Please work on thinking of what you say and how a person could interpret that - mental health issues are NO party and certainly not anything to make a light issue of. Some people struggle so bad that they take drastic measures, and your belittling and rude comments will provide no help in them improving their mentality.

OP I can only speak from my personal experience which is somewhat similar - I have been to the hospital a couple times with the same sensations/symptoms. I too had ECG’s, blood tests, chest x-rays, etc. The first doctor had said to me it was stress-induced (which seemed reasonable at the time), gave me beta-blockers and sent me on my way.
On my second visit (and more in depth tests) the doctors came to the same conclusion - all tests were normal and I am fine. BUT they did tell me to go see a specialist to double check! This is because doctors have a lot of patients to see and a lot of symptoms to suss out. They refer you to a specialist because a specialist is exactly what it says - they know what to look out for, so it’s an ‘insurance policy’ per se.

I suspect this will be the same case for you. And I still suffer with the symptoms months later. And it still bothers me. But we both have to remember, medical professionals are trained to know what is going on and explore every possible route. Remember: it is extremely unlikely that there is something wrong. It is extremely likely that you are feeling this way because of your health anxiety. But you’ve been through this before and you’ve been fine... this will be the same, I promise.

I encourage you to seek mental help from friends, family or professionals if you feel you need it. I will have an ear to lend if you need it, sending you love and hugs <3"
