depression,f4p1i3q,t1_f4ov08j,1571713434.0,"I appreciate the kind words. 

As for trying to talk myself up, it never works :( I have noticed lately I think/say small things to myself throughout my days and it‚Äôs implanted in my head that I think I am a piece of shit, stupid and slow, (when i mess up silly small things at work or life even though the average person would say im pretty normal) I really do have a hard time thinking about myself in a positive way and it‚Äôs probably the worst part. 

For goals, I‚Äôve made getting a GED and fixing my car up and lots of other things and the only place I get is having laundry on the floor, sleeping in til my night shifts and never seeing people or the sun, and BARELY taking care of myself. I don‚Äôt know what happen. And it scares me the most that I can‚Äôt support myself in this current situation but I think I will be jgstting kicked out soon and will just be royally fucked. I‚Äôve thought about getting a new job or second one but currently my walmart scehdule is buttfuck upside down, and without my ged or diploma I doubt ill find anything better than what I got going on. It may be shitty but im getting 12/hr and 25-35 hours a week. Its like just enough to survive (cause i cannot budget to save my life or have any savings) but not have to pay rent like currently. For a bit of perspective, I used to have an okay job and lived in an apartment with someone but i was extrnemly depressed from a past relationship that left me fucked up that I lost that job and lost where I was living. Im extremely lucky rn and even more so to have someone to care for me and from the sounds of her, she isnt going anywhere anytime soon so at least I got that going for me even if I take a step or two back :/ 

It‚Äôs just been a rough day. Usually I go to work do my shit and go home and sleep but the other day i have a life scare when I was high as fuck. I used to smoke all the time basically daily, and idk what came across me but it fucked my head up and all I want to do is change this shit. Change my life and start to fucking move on and stop being at a stand still. BUT I DONT KNOW WHERE THE FUCK TO START. And I end up overwhelming myself with EVERYTHING"

I found the loml and i want to change for her but i am freaking the fuck out cause im extrmeely overwhelemd and dont know where to begin and i freak out even more when I think ab her and how im being all mopey to her even though she is supporting me 100%"
