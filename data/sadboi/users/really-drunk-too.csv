This funding model funded huge multi-year excavations at a site in the past. However, most countries today no longer allow foreign archeologists to remove the antiquities from their country, so this funding model has died out.

I assume sensationalism is still needed for today’s archeologists? I would think grant/funding sources want to see their money is being used to make a huge impact."
