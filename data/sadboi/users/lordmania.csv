A little compassion towards people who are going through suicidal ideation would be extremely beneficial in my opinion, but usually patients are just treated as a nuisance.

It was a much nicer experience and the nurses actually treated me like a human being and got me some help.

illnessfakersgonewild,fpnhh55,t3_gec4qr,1588763032.0,"Yes and no.  So, we can use opioids, but very sparingly. The benefits absolutely must outweigh the risks. Opioids shouldn't be used long term anyway, but definitely not for someone with gastroparesis, especially if they're not taking any gut motility drugs, and especially if their gastroparesis is so severe they need a tube. Most of these munchies claim to have the most severe case ever and always aim to get a tube but at the same time somehow always want to be taking opioids. My suspicion is that most of them don't actually have gastroparesis, and what they're really dealing with is delayed bowels and gastric emptying caused by excessive opioid use. I'm willing to bet that if they stopped using so many opioids much of their gastric symptoms would clear up.

For reference, my diagnosis is moderate diabetic gastroparesis. I easily control my symptoms with diet and medication. I'm prescribed Dilaudid for a separate issue, but take it only as needed.

Edit: I should add that every case is different, and what works for one patient may not work for another. My personal experience will not be the exact same as every other gastroparesis patient. My point is that opioid use isn't unheard of in gastroparesis patients, but again, the benefit must absolutely outweigh the risks."

Advice,fpjnflu,t1_fpit34b,1588674979.0,"I'd like to give another perspective as a person with several chronic illnesses and disability that survived what's called ""dependent abuse"" just is case any other chronically ill and/or disabled people are reading;

They will oversee all your medical care. They will be present at all doctors' appointments. If you get SSI, SSDI, or disability payments, they will act as your payee and oversee how your money is spent. They'll use your illness(es)/disabilities against you (e.g; ""you can't survive without me!""; ""nobody will want to be with a sick/disabled person, I'm all you'll ever have"", etc.) They'll constantly remind you that your illness/disability makes you worthless in society. They'll steal your medication to either sell or get high with it. They'll sexually assault you while you're in an inebriated state from said medications. They'll force you to have sex even if you're experiencing a flare up, or aren't feeling well. They'll answer phone calls from physicians for you. They might try and become power of attorney if they're particularly savvy. They present themselves as your savior and an amazing person who sacrifices everything for you to others. If you're mentally ill or take medication that causes you to forget things, they'll use this to gaslight you. If you're mentally ill they'll have you 5150d/sanctioned constantly. They'll tell you you're too sick to have friends, socialize, go to school, get a job, etc. They'll purposely try and trigger a flare up or episode (for example, my ex purposely hid gluten in my food and I have very severe symptoms from celiac disease)... the list goes on.

This was my life for many years. I'm extremely fortunate to have gotten out and gone through extensive therapy to help with my PTSD. Many aren't so lucky. This type of abuse is extremely pernicious. They start off nicely enough, usually as someone who seems caring about your illness(es) and/or disability, but slowly show their true colors and trap you under their thumb.

Advice,fp8wo3p,t3_gbzq18,1588405603.0,"Hey, so let me chime in as a sex worker here for a bit here because I've dealt with so many angry and/or hurt girlfriends;

First of all, it's good to remember that all relationship dynamics are different. What's cheating in one relationship may be completely OK in another.

Next, I want to point out how the normalization of monogamy has really put pressure on individuals to be everything that a singular other person needs, and well, this isn't exactly realistic which is why so many people are turning to polyamory or open relationships now. Sex workers are providing a service. Point blank. Usually people pay us to fulfill a need they can't get from their partner(s). In OP's case, her boyfriend paid a sex worker to fulfill a need of his that she couldn't. This, in my opinion, is far more respectful than pressuring her into doing it herself or cheating. Where he went wrong was doing it behind her back. It's kind of understandable why he did it secretly, considering it's a bit of a taboo fetish, but it probably would have been better if he at least discussed it vaguely with her. Luckily, she didn't find anything inherently immoral or illegal. Gross? Yes. Wrong? Not really. There's far worse out there, trust me. 

A reminder to everyone reading; again, we sex workers are merely providing a service. We're usually not interested in stealing your partner(s). We're just trying to make money like any other person working in customer service. Please try to not lash out at us if you find your partner(s) have been buying services from us behind your back. It isn't our job to vet every client's relationship status or boundaries. Our job is to get our clients off without the need for emotional attachment.

Finally, some advice; I highly implore all people in monogamous relationships to have a conversation with their significant other about these particular boundaries. If your partner isn't able to satisfy you in a certain way that you feel you need (humans are sexual beings whether you want to admit it or not and thus have sexual needs), or vice versa, it may be beneficial to your relationship to discuss possibly allowing you or your partner to pay for said need."

This was before the big opioid crisis so the shit was given out like candy after surgery in California,  where I lived at the time. I was taking far more than I needed because the more one takes, the more one will need. Eventually, one has to take a certain dose to feel normal. Opioids are so incredibly pernicious, so if she's actually dependent or addicted, a high dose of painkillers won't do much to cognitively impair her.

You're doing this by choice. You can stop at any moment and just eat your nuggests if you wanted to."
illnessfakersgonewild,fp593my,t3_gbau2r,1588320630.0,I'm convinced she's just addicted to lying at this point. It must be pathological.
quityourbullshit,fp58x5y,t1_fp2ivdy,1588320446.0,"Sorry, but I really can't stand liars. If something smells like bullshit I'm going to take at least a quick peak at their history.  You typically don't have to dig very deep to find contradictions when it comes to people like this because chronic liars rarely can keep their stories straight. People get away with lying way too much and it needs to stop in my opinion. I guess it's just a huge pet peeve of mine."
quityourbullshit,fp58p9i,t1_fp2c3co,1588320216.0,"Right? Like, at the very least make it interesting. This is the most boring, slice of life sex fantasy I've ever read."
AskReddit,fp38oqi,t1_fp33w3e,1588275022.0,I wear kigurumi style costumes. I have them in various characters. They're easy to strip out of but look hilarious on.
AskReddit,fp29hkk,t1_fp295mt,1588257769.0,"I'm bisexual so only one of my partners is a man, the other two are non-binary. 

There's a whole community of polyamorous people looking for like minded individuals who share the same values. I'm not naturally a jealous person, and neither are my partners, so it works. You could go browse r/polyamory to get a feel of the community."
AskReddit,fp293m1,t1_fp28msd,1588257559.0,Ha! I'll take photos or video sometime and post it! It's pretty damn ridiculous if you really think about it.
AskReddit,fp28xi8,t1_fp28edu,1588257468.0,Nope! Work is work. I'm polyamorous and have three great partners who are equally openminded. Being in a relationship with those you're compatible with makes a world of difference.
AskReddit,fp2865d,t1_fp27zda,1588257052.0,This is actually such a common request that it doesn't even register as odd anymore. I refuse to do anything involving scat though. It just grosses me out too much.
AskReddit,fp280de,t1_fp26vux,1588256964.0,"It actually is fun sometimes! I love being a dominatrix, it's just hard to stay in character and act sexy while I'm dressed up as Pooh Bear."
AskReddit,fp27rfp,t1_fp27cpj,1588256828.0,"Trust me, it's *very* hard to not laugh while in character. My fellow sex worker friends and I constantly have to hold back from cackling at some of the requests we get."
Rabbits,fp22yr2,t3_garxu2,1588254073.0,Thank you for leaving this here.
