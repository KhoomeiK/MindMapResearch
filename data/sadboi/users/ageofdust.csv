EUGENIACOONEY,fdi8dl8,t1_fdgw4f3,1578437568.0,"I understand your point entirely. But she may not be able to at this stage. I think her illness was, and still is, quite severe. Expecting someone on the precipice of death who has suffered years, if not a decade, of severe malnutrition (which tends to shrink the brain and impair neural connections), to exercise insight, moral rationality and sound judgement... well, it’s probably not going to happen. We want her to see things from our perspective but the clouded judgment is a hallmark of the disease. I do think that insight will come with time. It did with me. But it took years for my brain to recover enough for me to think clearly. I barely remember the years I was ill. I lived in a delusional fog."

EUGENIACOONEY,f9bcv16,t3_e3utn7,1575211382.0,"At this point, I think the internet (with all its judgments, suppositions, prodding, erraticisms, voyeuristic dissections and verbal abuse) may be equally, if not more toxic than her home environment. Or more toxic than the home environment we presume her to have. If bullying was indeed the trigger for her restriction, the internet, over the last few years, can’t have helped. I pray she finds her way. I think the internet has the “potential” to be one (of many) instruments in her recovery – if it provides a segue into meaningful, honest, non-exploitive connections outside of itself. This includes interest-based resources that allow her to explore her passions, talents and hobbies and further develop her identity outside of her eating disorder."
