jobs,fpy2pz4,t3_gfxmx3,1588994723.0,I graduated with my bachelors in May 2019 and I still haven‚Äôt been able to find a job because of no experience. I‚Äôve been working as a server for almost 3 years. It sucks. Every day I feel as though I‚Äôll never find full time work or a career.
Herpes,fom4kwl,t1_fom1xx8,1587878151.0,Do you take daily medications? I used to have that too until I started taking Valtrex daily. I also noticed that the less I let herpes consume my thoughts the less I had symptoms. Sometimes when you overthink something you cause symptoms that aren‚Äôt actually there. Trust me when I say I used to tingle constantly.

Even when I tell them and they consent there‚Äôs still a part of me thats hesitant or scared of passing it. But at the end of the day, they accepted it and took that chance. Informing them is all you can really do."
