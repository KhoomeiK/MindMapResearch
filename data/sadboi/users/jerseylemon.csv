Realizing they depended on me and loved me was the only reason I text my husband who was asleep upstairs and told him I have to get to the hospital now. Shortly after texting that, I started having seizures from the overdose. My husband drove me to the emergency room and I literally fell onto the hospital parking lot pavement trying to get out of the car. It was too late to pump my stomach and I wasn't conscience. I was out for 16 hours, laying on a hospital bed with my husband sitting there wondering if I'd die. I woke up, had $35k worth of brain scans in 4 days and was released after psychiatrist approval. 6 years later, my cats are still alive and I feel like such a failure for even attempting that."
