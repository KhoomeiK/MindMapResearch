depression,est2oll,t3_c33l5j,1562261329.0,Dont give up. I havent given up yet. Lost my mom when i was two. She killed herself why i dont know and will probaly never know. It is not a day goes by that i dont think about her. I even lost some one i love and care about more than anybody every even my mom. She was the best thing to come in my life. She not dead just gone from my life. It hurts not knowing what she doing or if she ok. I ask god why do you answer my prayers and give me what i wanted just to have you take them from me!!  I keep going though even thou i feel like quiting and just give up. But. Just maybe by a chance she will come back to me again. That what keeps me going. So dont give up.
