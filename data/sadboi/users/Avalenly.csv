Judaism,fnsnmjf,t1_fnsdxkh,1587225264.0,"As a person with a Jewish non practicing father, I‚Äôm doing a conversion course with Reform Judaism and I can confirm it‚Äôs very intense. I spend around 5 hours a week in classes / services/ informal chats with my rabbi and local community and am facing at least 18 months of intense study and active involvement post conversion. I personally think the process is overly strict as I don‚Äôt think the majority of Jews by birth would devote this much time to study. I mean honestly if your feelings are this sincere and you‚Äôve lived as a Jew for your whole life who is to say you aren‚Äôt? I wouldn‚Äôt bother with a conversion course unless you‚Äôre prepared to make religion your life for the next 1.5-2 years, because if you work 50-60 hours a week like I do it will take up all your free time and you will essentially be sacrificing years of your life just to gain someone‚Äôs approval. I‚Äôm sticking to it because I value it, but trust me there are days I just want to quit so I can pursue other interests I have no time for otherwise."

AMA,ex83w1m,t1_ex6i2b9,1566068407.0,Cults are usually designed by very intelligent leaders who use a range of psychological tools to get you to follow and believe in them. I genuinely believed my soul was going to be saved. I actually feel really anxious criticizing it even though I left years ago- that‚Äôs how deeply rooted these beliefs were! My best friend left first which made me begin to question things. I also had a couple of moments of clarity (I like to debate and this was met with hostility on several occasions as the teachings weren‚Äôt meant to be questioned). My friend began questioning things earlier and kept coming back to why I was still a part of it. She tried to make me see that things were severely wrong with the group and the leader until at some point I just cut them off.
AMA,ex830fl,t1_ex6opvo,1566068088.0,"It has been recognized as a cult by several experts. The teachings are very prescriptive and when I began to question some of them (eg the teacher taught that LGBT people are possessed by spirits) that was not tolerated. Everything the mother taught had to be accepted. She claimed she was the incarnation of the Holy Spirit so you can imagine what authority that gave her. She also asked for her swastika covered feet to be washed by followers and the water then had to be drunk. A lot of the devotion centered on her feet for some reason, I guess as a sign of utmost respect and humility. Members also donated most of their money and time to supporting the community, and were ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù not to associate with outsiders. The authority figures also used deprivation and hypnotism to bring you to exhaustion so you would lose all control over yourself and your judgment."

AMA,ex6epdq,t1_ex67kmw,1566044403.0,It was now-Hindu and focused on liberating your inherent spiritual energy (kundalini) through different meditative techniques. This was all taught by an Indian spiritual teacher who we called our mother and so a lot of it was worshipping her. They marketed it as a free meditation class and when you kept coming back they knew you could be let further in. I was new to meditation and really excited by it which is what led me to get more and more involved.
changemyview,ewigane,t1_ewifr47,1565448524.0,"Actually let me give you a tip. Define YOUR style, whatever makes sense to you and follow simple ideas such as:
Only wear one patterned item 
Contrast your top from your pants/ bottom half (e.g white shirt with black pants)
Loose or baggy tops go best with tighter bottom pieces - Don‚Äôt wear baggy pants / bottom pieces with baggy tops 


These are not rules that will be 100% true in all instances, because every piece of clothing is different. However it‚Äôs an easy set of ideas to stick to and you can‚Äôt go wrong with it."
changemyview,ewifr47,t3_cohai7,1565448171.0,"I think the word you‚Äôre looking for is that it‚Äôs an abstract concept. Like composition (of a painting, a room etc) and other related artistic concepts. However, just because it‚Äôs abstract doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs completely arbitrary. Different styles convey a lot of social information, and after all most of us live in large societies. It is a part of visual communication about groups you belong to or who you are as a person. Whether or not you have to adhere to specific tastes in picking out an outfit is up to you. It may signify that you don‚Äôt follow stylistic trends to other people, which is absolutely fine. There‚Äôs no real need to know anything about fashion, however the clothes you wear convey meaning to others about who you are as a person so people will respond to that. I think for a lot of people these things are intuitive and I speak from experience. I just know when something will look good and when it won‚Äôt, down to a very detailed level, but I don‚Äôt really follow fashion. It‚Äôs more of a sense of aesthetics. Kind of how I imagine a painter picks out the ‚Äúright‚Äù colors."

there is nothing wrong with veganism and all the biggest dietary associations in the world have released reports which support the health benefits of veganism at all stages of life. You obviously don‚Äôt agree with how their family chooses to live and want to push that onto them. This is no different from someone claiming children should not be raised Muslim just because you may not agree with it. You were put in a position of trust and you did not honor or respect that. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you really never hear from them again. It would be better to own up to your mistake before it‚Äôs too late..."
AmItheAsshole,evqu7rq,t3_cknaus,1564697428.0,"ESH. You are allowed to make your own decisions and have your set of values and beliefs, and those are not things any adult, let alone human being, should be asked to compromise on. The fact that this isn‚Äôt clear to you seems worrisome. Your husband seems to not grasp this idea either. Maybe you need to talk about both of your values and life goals and land on some compatible ground, because this is may be a red flag for similar conflicts down the road. Chances are you just haven‚Äôt realized the depth of this situation. It seems like you have a solid foundation of support in your relationship so if you talk about how you really feel and how this is just as important to you as his own life choices such as opening a restaurant, he will be understanding and supportive."
neuroscience,evh21qw,t3_cjj50n,1564519367.0,"Don‚Äôt do a PHD if you‚Äôre not into a career in academia. If you are, consider that 50% of early career researchers drop out of academic research within 5 years. 

I did a masters in neuroscience which made me more competitive on the job market compared to people with a bachelors and have me research experience to pursue data analytics for a private consultancy in healthcare. Not continuing down the academic route is one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made and data focused roles are in great demand. Learn data science while you have the time and use opportunities for research to their fullest, or do an internship on top of uni. Don‚Äôt start with python as it‚Äôs very foreign seeming to someone who hasn‚Äôt ever programmed before. I started with R which was immediately understandable with the stats knowledge I have. If research and numbers are not your thing, consider user research or marketing."

It sounds like you just don‚Äôt like each other and none of this was really about the onion.  Think about what the real story is here. What does the onion really symbolize?

Fixing your relationship is going to be about letting her cut the onion herself, not being stubborn. You should have drawn the line there, because anything beyond that is just ego play. Both sides need to work on the relationship and you fix things through small changes to the way you interact which sets up new boundaries and new dynamics.

Yes I am a psychologist"
