depression,f72qb3b,t1_f72pmn2,1573373885.0,"I think it would be better if she admitted that she had a depression, got some help, and was open about that with me. I think the whole thing aggravated bc she didn't admit and see the doctor sooner. Keeping that under water will just make everything worse, cuz that's just a fake happiness. 
I'm sorry for what you went through. It's nice to know that your kids will have a good mother."
depression,f72p2r8,t3_du7s40,1573372464.0,Here you have my attention. Wanna talk about something?
depression,f72oygk,t1_f72oo7c,1573372296.0,"Oh and I didn't like knowing that she has a depression, cuz she started to use that as a weapon and an excuse. When I heard it, I was just like, so what? I knew it bitch you had a problem. 

Unlike you, my ma showed no fake emotions. Everything was true. I hope she faked some, fake that she is happy and glad, for my sake."
depression,f72oo7c,t3_du7hr6,1573371896.0,"Hi. My mum has a depression. I didn't know she had it, until she started to break down recently. 
My childhood wasn't the worst, but it wasn't the best. She couldn't control her emotions so she kinda let it all out to me. When she has control, she only knew about herself and her feelings. She didn't show interest in my life. She didn't care whom I meet, who are my friends, when I came home, what I feel and what I think. But she did care about my future, so that I can live an independent life. 
Since she only cared about her feelings, she beat me a lot whenever she couldn't control her anger and sadness. She said some stuff too, affecting my self esteem. She did it cuz her feelings came first over my feelings.

Well my advice? Don't beat your kids, nor say harsh words no matter what. Try to hear what they say and have an empathy. Don't pity yourself and lock yourself up. I know your case and my ma's case are not identical.. I wish your kids won't become like me. Good luck :)"
depression,f72mcjy,t3_du2v7l,1573368708.0,I love you too.
depression,f6yc48m,t3_dtjg6g,1573274274.0,"I think so. I mean, nostalgia does bring some depressive mood. It makes me think about those remain in the past, like happy myself, well-functioning and loving family, friends, hopes and dreams, belief that there will be a better future. But well,  then I realize that those are gone, and start to think what I could have been, or done if I chose different path, if that thing didn't happen, if I never met that person..."
depression,f6bmlvl,t1_f6bkcc4,1572775640.0,True. But let's not :) We should try until we can't right?
depression,f6bhueo,t1_f6bhi12,1572773919.0,"Some think feeling nothing is better than feeling miserable, but i don't agree with that. I hope you can find your light again.."
depression,f6b96gi,t1_f6b7os7,1572770440.0,Ikr.. idk what to do
depression,f6b6dok,t3_dqx0is,1572769005.0,"Hey. It seems that you feel you are not loved, at least not enough.. i'm sorry for just guessing. It must have been painful for enduring and stuffing all those thoughts of yours. If you want, you can talk to me."
depression,f6b4bra,t3_dqx204,1572767976.0,"Well I hope you could put some burden down here. Not having anyone that loves you, at least thinking that there is no one sucks. Some says that love isn't everything, and some says that love is not that worthy. But still, it would be nice if I had someone that loves me and to love back. I may not be that helpful for you to feel better, but I just wanted to say that ig I feel what you feel too. Good luck man. And if you want to talk to someone, im all ears for you."
depression,f6b2hmn,t1_f6b1pnd,1572767090.0,"Well how did it go? I mean, it wasn't helpful?"
depression,f6avx54,t3_dqwb47,1572763361.0,Well have you visited doctor or something? For help?
depression,f6avb82,t3_dqr9g1,1572763079.0,"I agree. Realizing that what they think of ""normal"" was too high standard for me was terrible."
depression,f6av2hw,t3_dqs8jf,1572762967.0,I know that my words are only shallow and I can't dare assume your situtation. But I wish you to be able to be satisfied with your life someday.
depression,f5stf40,t1_f5srcjl,1572442687.0,"I really want to agree, but in my case it's very personal and intentional."
depression,f5sr6yx,t1_f5sqonw,1572440964.0,Yeah I should not take it seriously..
depression,f5sqfty,t1_f5spy75,1572440343.0,"Thanks for saying that I don't deserve it. It's nice to hear that. I have this member of family who keeps telling me that I'm a monster almost everyday and I can't keep thinking nice of myself near her. Well about calibrating reality and challenging my ego, my ego is already crushed so nothing to challenge lol. You have a point tho cuz I can't see what the reality is. I can't say what is right or wrong and everything is mixed up, even myself. Need someone to remind me that I'm not a vilain here, and maybe that's why Im still posting at reddit like an attention whore."
depression,f5spl90,t1_f5sp39w,1572439631.0,That's the problem ig. I think I'm a terrible person and be punished somehow. Keep spiraling these thoughts.
depression,f5snc4r,t1_f5sm02v,1572437553.0,"I have been thinking that I'm no good to anyone. I'm awkward and I let out toxic words that hurt others even though I don't want to. I regret everything I did everyday. I want to make my friends happy but I'm not sure Im doing that well. Idk if I'm not valuable to anyone, then what's the point of living?"
