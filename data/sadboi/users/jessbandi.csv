If my husband told me he had 0 sexual desires, I'd be devastated, but I wouldn't want to leave him. I'd hope we could find some kind of agreement, in a way that we both desired.

If you want to make it work with you, you need to explain, just as you understand and respect her lack of sexual desire she needs to respect and understand your sexual desires. So she either works with you to continue to please you, you please yourself, you both have a mutual agreement for a solution (such as open relationship) or it ends.

I've never been pregnant and I don't have any kids yet, but I am not the touchy-feely type of person. I don't even like hugging my family.  and based on what I know, most pregnant women don't like people touching their belly unless they're close to them.

As a lot of people have already pointed out their behavior is a little strange if it truly is a harmless act of him wanting to feel the baby. But let me just say, when somebody asks to feel a pregnant woman's typically that doesn't mean to lift up her shirt so they can rub lotion on her belly. That's really bizarre. You're not the only one who would feel the way that you do, and I do think that you might get good perspective if you ask her if the roles were reversed how would she feel if you were rubbing lotion on another woman's belly.

rant,erqeaju,t1_erq8p03,1561141348.0,"Yes, I'll explain to you why. Weed doesn't necessarily ""get you high"". That's a very general statement. THC is the psychoactive chemical found in cannabis. There are MANY different kinds, another popular one is CBD which has absolutely 0 psychoactive effects. 

For example: I ""smoke weed"". I have a prescription for medical cannabis, and have a CBD dry flower strain. I can smoke this marijuana during the day and I will feel 0 psychoactive effects because it only contains CBD. If I have  a T4 (for example) which is a really strong Tylenol (pain killer) I will feel worse intoxicating side effects than a CBD strain. So yes, I'm comparing weed to Tylenol. That's just an FYI.

Drugs as defined by my country's drug regulations: Marijuana is a DRUG.  Alcohol is a DRUG. Prescribed medications are DRUGS. Over the counter medications are DRUGS. Whether or not you take sleeping pills, Viagra pills or pain killers (Tylenol) you are using pharmaceutical drugs. In some states or countries like mine, where cannabis is considered a legal drug, these are treated the same. It's hypocritical for someone to have the opinion that they don't use cannabis because they are anti-drug unless they use absolutely 0 pharmaceuticals including OTC medications (as well as topical creams containing drugs)  and don't drink alcohol. It sounds extremely ignorant.

True story example of rape involving alcohol: I got really drunk with a group of guys I thought we were pals.  I was so drunk, I was in and out of consciousness so they helped me to my room. I was on my bed, where it starts to obviously get weird. They thought it was so funny how messed up I was because I was so drunk they took pictures of me totally passed out on my bed (over the covers, wearing all of my clothes). They all left except one, I think he was saying that he wanted to make sure that I was okay. Anyways he had sex with me, and I only remember bits and pieces of it. I was so disgusted in the morning I told him to leave and I couldn't look him in the eyes, and I would get nauseous just thinking about it.  My therapist, who isn't the first to say this, said that she thinks I was drugged because most people who get blackout drunk typically pass out and that's it. But the fact that I can recall these bits and pieces in and out of consciousness , she says is very familiar to people who have been slipped a drug in their drink.

Another example of me having sex whilst drunk, went out with a couple guys for a birthday celebration, we all got pretty drunk, but I invited the birthday boy back to my room, and we had drunk sex. I was totally aware of all of it and I initiated it even while drunk.

Of course, there are people that can do racial actions and claim that they're just trying to embrace the culture very common and basic example would be blackface. However because of this, now it seems everything is considered cultural appropriation and that you're a racist if you do it. An example of this would be that I think braids are beautiful, and I think that the way that black hair stylist do braids is super cool and impressive. However if a white girl wears braids like that then people will complain about her hair and say that she's a culprit of culture appropriation which is bullshit."
rant,eqpntm0,t3_byz0jj,1560201917.0,"as someone that has diagnosed mental illness, I understand your frustration, because it's frustrating to me when people are diagnosed say that they have something like depression when it legitimately is an illness that affects somebody for the rest of their life. That being said a lot of people have mental illness, more than you think, more than we know because of the stigma and because not a lot of people have the resources to go and get a diagnosis.  In order to get a diagnosis you need to see a psychiatrist. it costs usually a couple hundred dollars to go see a psychiatrist for a session, let alone a couple to be able to determine an appropriate diagnosis. Which is why so many people continue to have mental illnesses without being diagnosed."

The only thing you can do is just continue to support her through this. It's just as exhausting if not more for her as it is for you to constantly support her and see no improvement. It can be pretty hard for others, but it's just important for you to constantly be there and be positive for her because she doesn't feel that way."

depression,eq4l15g,t3_bx0tv8,1559779221.0,"Yes. Ultimately it's because of your inability to focus, so inadvertently not listening, therefore not remembering things being told to you. Mine got so bad that I didn't even remember having conversations with people. One time somebody told me I needed to do something I guess, I don't remember. The next day they approached me and asked me if I did it and I honestly don't even remember seeing them the day before."
