However, she has caused so much hurt for you. I‚Äôm not saying she deserves it, but if your mental health is being damaged almost daily and it‚Äôs bad enough to post about it on here, take into account what‚Äôs best for YOU. She may threaten those things like suicide, but don‚Äôt let it scare you. It‚Äôs a tactic they use to keep you around. It‚Äôs not fair.

I know basically everyone‚Äôs is. But it‚Äôs hitting me hard.

I went to college late and took 5 years to figure out what I actually wanted to do and I finally settled on a degree path I‚Äôm passionate about and have worked so incredibly hard. I struggle with schizoaffective disorder, PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and ADHD, so school is one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to focus on.

It‚Äôs been making me spiral into a depression of feeling worthless cuz I‚Äôm also unemployed due to this virus.

I‚Äôve been checking stats like crazy and today my country finally took the lead in number of cases and our fucking joke of a president is not doing ANYTHING to help us.

I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of living in fear and isolation."
