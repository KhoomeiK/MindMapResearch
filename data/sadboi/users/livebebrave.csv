We stopped saying I love you to each other because it hurts so much to say it because we need to heal but it's such a habit of mine to do so. I'm really sad and trying to get through mental health crises and crippling anxiety and have been taking benzos to help me fall asleep because otherwise anxiety will take over and I can't sleep. My finances and future are a constant worry. I'm in a job I don't really like but need at this time for stability. I have very few friends, and I am trying to make it one day at a time. Life used to feel so much better and I don't know how to not be the strong one for other people because I believed my worth was being the strong one for other people. I am living under the same roof with my soon to be ex-spouse and want her to come home so badly so I won't be alone but being around her hurts too. I don't know what to do with my life, everything hurts so badly. I have therapy on the 10th of next month, but it is a new therapist and the other one doesn't take insurance anymore. I feel like I'm drowning and have nowhere to go or nowhere to turn to. Although writing this right now made me feel better. I just want to have hope for the future and get out of this hell I am living in."

Second, I want to validate whatever you are feeling at this moment, and will continue to feel in the weeks, months, years ahead. Lastly, please take care of yourself, eat, brush your teeth, shower. I know it feels impossible, but it does get easier but be prepared for the waves of grief down the line. 

The thing that helped for me was to continue to mention him, if he was spoken into light, then he would be real and not forgotten.

If you don't have a support network, please reach out to me, I'm not kidding. My Dad was my best friend and the closest person I ever lost and I know how this feels. The offer is always open. 

Much love to you in this terrible, terrible time."

Your story could have been mine, we were college sweethearts and came into life and marriage with no real plans, just that we loved each other. It sucks but it's better than staying in a relationship where you are woefully unhappy, no matter how much you love that person.

It's going to suck for the both of us but it took courage to strive for your happiness (and hers as well, as she was unhappy) for the future. It will be okay."
