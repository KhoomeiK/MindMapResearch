1. I believe there's a 2 week compensation if you do get sick. can't say 100% on that.

2. we have to store use gloves, masks, alcohol, sanitizers... and well, we can rarely grab any because customers come to buy them all. We have some, but not everyone wears any. if you wear a mask, you have to sign a waiver for it so the company won't be liable. For what though, I don't even know.

3. we have a drive thru, and that's constantly busy from open to close. we also have curbside pick up, so we have lots of activity on those sides. not as many people in store but still enough for it to get hectic.

4. we don't have barriers, but we do have tape and stickers on the floor to tell people where to stand a safe distance away from each other. but some people don't comply to that.  we are supposed to get either sneezeguards or plexiglass installed, but it's going in order of the store number. my store  is one of the larger numbers, so we won't get ours till the end  of the period. so till then, not much protection."
