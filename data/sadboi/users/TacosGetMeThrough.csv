AskAnAmerican,fprsxny,t1_fpqifvx,1588861419.0,I had to work 1 year before I was eligible for 5 days vacation & healthcare. I've been there 3 years & I get 10 days..... we work a 6 day work week so I'm still not at 2 weeks vacation.
AskAnAmerican,fprrv53,t1_fpqu98j,1588860819.0,"You know its funny you say that.  I work for a semi small business (vets office) & have a very controlling & abusive boss. I work 6 days a week almost 52 weeks a year. I've never called off/out sick in my 3 years & barely use my vacation.  I come in early when asked.... actually it's not even ""asked"" just expected. And I stay late every day because it's one of those jobs that's not done until its done.  I'm typically seen as a top worker. 

Typically we get a production bonus, meaning if we're in the green for the week some of that money is divvied up & given to staff as a bonus about 9-10% of your wage.  Last couple weeks we blew it out of the water more than I'd ever seen like 30+k over every week. We get our paychecks & there is no bonus. After the 5 people in my office discuss I called the manager he said bonus is canceled. 

Come to find out some people did get bonus in fact 2 teenagers I'd been training who only have worked there 1-2 months got bonus. I've never stuck up for myself in my life but I called a different manager & complained.  I said I'm burnt out, exhausted, & overworked. I asked why exactly they feel that I shouldn't get a bonus & why they lied & said they were canceled. 

The owner cleared it all up for me by telling me to my face that bonus is now just for those that go ABOVE & BEYOND. And that suddenly my bonus is also dependent on team performance & my team had made minor mistakes so sorry we will be SOL for bonus for THE REST OF THE YEAR. This was never the case before it was always just if we made her lots of money we got a tiny bit of it. Another Dr. On staff told me it just goes to her favorite people now & me & the owner have been clashing a lot lately, mainly over how staff is treated badly. 

Needless to say I will not be staying.  And now it seems foolish to have worked so hard & set the bar so high because they just kept moving it."

It's just a shame, it could have been a great partnership but the owner ruined it.  I have had problems with small businesses in the past, where there is no real ""HR"" because the owner has the end say.  If owners were smart they would listen to those they pay to advise them.

I built my self up by getting in the oil & gas industry & was laid off within 2 years.  I then did temp work.  Until I found work at a vet clinic that was on the up.  We were thriving & growing.  Business was booming.  

Now we are forced to shut down/reduced hours.  I get the concern but this is a small business with a staff of maybe 40. The business that the owner built will likely not survive as it is now.

So while people are paid from home to type on a desk & post their ""Day x of quarantine I'm doing x"". Some of us are not going to make it through.  I will be laid off. Our business can not run from home. Our business will never be the same. We will likely not be able to hire our amazing team back due to economic downturn.

Its hard to talk though because to him objects mean so much but to me they are just things. So he feels I'm insensitive when I am just more detached. So I have to find a way to convey that every object isn't as important as the next. Quality over quantity.

I don't know how the show is vetted but I get the feeling with this episode that they go in mostly blind considering how it took a more serious turn. I think considering the light hearted nature of the podcast less vetting is typically ok.

The problem with this situation is a deeper life lesson. You think moving in with your best friend will be the time of your life, but with wisdom that can likely only be earned with experience, it is almost never a good idea. I just advised against it with two friends who are now having the same issues. 

I feel for the guy who has the baby but I don't think going on a public podcast is a time to air ALL personal grievances. And to me it is apparent he is fed up with the whole living situation. 

Although the guy who brought the suit-- I don't quite get what he was asking for as it seems his friend had gone on the roof before? So I feel he was just trying to get on the show for something or just trying to get his old friendship back. 

Kind of a sad one.

I feel there is a bigger meaning to be had here.  As someone who is severely depressed this show came at the right time and made me think.  A depressed person in a relationship it all gets ruined, your job, your relationship, your motivation.  And you hate yourself.  Wouldn't you kill the ""bad"" in you if you could? That's where the spa & clone comes in. The ""newer better version"". The clones purpose was to make him see what he always had, because the clone wanted his life. And I liked that the wife wanted the good and the bad in her husband.  Hence she said he was too perfect when he should have been more miserable.  I feel the right end would be to kill the clone. That would bring it full circle, to kill the idea that being perfect & always happy is better than being real. 

I mean that's just my deeply personal read on it.

As far as season 2 what will they do, the clone will just be a nanny? Won't he still be obsessed with the wife? Are they going to keep strangling each other but no one ever wins? Just seems pointless, like another season isn't really going to add anything to the show."
mildlyinfuriating,f7xbqc7,t1_f7x8bua,1574051921.0,I think too when you are or have been in need you see how much the little things helped to get you through so you're more willing to give when you have it.
LateStageCapitalism,f7p5oyg,t1_f7p5a04,1573942797.0,"Its just amazing to me how much people will accept as ""that's the way it is."" Its so bizarre to me to love a political party enough that you think well we can't both get cancer & medical treatment but we don't deserve it.

I honestly can't wrap my head around it you'd think personal experience would have changed him. I guess nothing can change some."
LateStageCapitalism,f7p0frp,t1_f7nyh89,1573938969.0,"Was arguing with my dad about how I can't afford health care doesn't he think I deserve to get help.  He said yeah but the people who pay more get better help if you can't pay you don't get help. 

This is from a man who had to go off his cancer/diabetes meds so that we could afford my mom's cancer treatment.

Like ok so all that was ok? You feel no personal upset we had to pick who was getting treated  cancer & medical conditions first."

I had gotten so used to everything being a blob. Now after years of constant use when I don't have them on I feel almost blind like how did I ever live like this."
AskAnAmerican,f6tfg28,t1_f6swl55,1573148136.0,That's true but I was thinking more neighbor across the street vs next door.  Her & her neighbor stare across the street lol.
AskAnAmerican,f6sf94q,t3_dsxbpm,1573133074.0,"I mean if you live in a housing development there are lots of houses that are the same or similar because they usually only have 3 or so types of houses to choose from. 

As for the staring, depending on your personality having neighbors can be hell.  My one friend has been battling over a shared driveway since she moved into her place.  There is lots of weird staredowns through windows among other shenanigans."

ABoringDystopia,f6018fz,t1_f5zw0im,1572599913.0,That's crazy.  There is so many rules now.  AFAIK a minor can't work 5 hours without getting a 30 min break before the 5th hr not to mention they are limited on how many hours per day/week.  At my job at the time a lot of minors couldn't work late because their license only let them drive up to a certain hour. Once you were over 18 though everything was fair game.
