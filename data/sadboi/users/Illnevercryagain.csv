depression,fpgyvbr,t3_gdf96m,1588611961.0,"Don't do it man, there's more to life than all this bullshit we go through. I can't even give you advice cuz I'm fucking depressed too, so if i knew how to get out id tell you but suicide itw just not it we gotta keep it pushing and hope for something good to happen. No love life, betrayed the trust of my loved ones and some of them betrayed my trust. I don't trust no fucking body but a friend who always was real. same thing here bud. Idk what to tell you besides get help or talk to someone you trust or call the suicide hotline but just don't do it man, we don't know what the future holds"
depression,fk0303j,t1_fk02vra,1583739406.0,"Also if you make friends and they're mean to you or just really toxic cut them off,  don't get attached if they are bad just because you're lonely, that really not a good thing."
depression,fk02vra,t3_ffr0cb,1583739246.0,"I'm shy and i have trouble making friends but in highschool i found some good friends who stuck with me, i lost the bad ones only the real ones left we graduated already and went out today in fact, idk if you're in highschool but that's a good place to make friends, some are shitty but just cut them off, if that's not the case just try to make friends let's say work or some place you're going to be all day or night in, I'm not the greatest advice giver but it's not as hard as our heads makes it seem (i still have trouble believing it) but its all in our heads if you get out there you may click with somebody, then you meet someone else who's friends with that somebody and make a chain of friends lol there's some pretty cool people on reddit too i guess lol again"

I've felt like saying fuck everything ima just head out and go homeless or some shit but it's not worth it because I've seen homeless people and its really sad the other day i saw a guy on the middle of the sidewalks and he was on fucking crack he was passed out sitting on the middle and people walking by and i think what if they felt like us and just said fuck it ? I'm tired of it all but ending up like that were u dont even have control of your body anymore ? Its tuff but regardless of what we feel we have something that if we didn't we would wish to have its better to wait so we better stick around and hope things get better ‚ô•Ô∏è"
