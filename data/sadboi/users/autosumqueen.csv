AskWomenOver30,fqn5dp1,t3_gjqpge,1589488956.0,Nope! Fuck this dude. One thing about marriage is respect. If he can‚Äôt see how his ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù makes you uncomfortable then he is not caring. A husband should have no problems dropping a friend for his wife. Give him a ultimatum. Stop being friends and remove her from your life or you walk. He can‚Äôt play you for a fool. And I bet 60 bucks if y‚Äôall break up that‚Äôs the first person he‚Äôd call. Sorry but go with your gut in this one.

DeadBedrooms,fc1x1ng,t3_dkk1rr,1577332352.0,"You and he need counseling. Opening up your marriage could/will be a temporary band aid. The underlying issues will always be there if you do not work them out. Is this person your best friend?? Marriage is work and it‚Äôs always work, but it‚Äôs worth it with the right person. Try counseling and in your sessions talk about opening it and work through it. I‚Äôve been with my husband for 10 years it‚Äôs ups and downs. But it sounds like y‚Äôall are holding onto resentment and that will lead to contempt and that is a marriage killer. Work it out with a professional, work it out for y‚Äôall kids. And if in the end y‚Äôall decide it‚Äôs not worth the work, then you can say you tried your best."
