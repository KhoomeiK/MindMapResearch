weed,flglx4k,t3_foqjle,1585145617.0,I've spent a lot of money looking for a good grinder.  They all sucked no matter how money I spent. The best one was the cheapest.  So I started using a Krups coffee grinder.  It's the best. You gotta be sure not to over grind it and it will get gunked up but it's a different idea in the same price range.

BipolarReddit,fldfe6y,t3_fo651d,1585063425.0,"They didn't give me my meds for two days ""because I didn't ask for it"" That's f'd up. Then for 3 days they kept trying to give me a med that I wasn't supposed to have. They even tried to give it to me on my way out the door. The problems were: the virus,  communication,  and most likely low wages. I didn't treat the staff as servants. They just were kind of there. I must say that all the staff seemed caring but society doesn't value that. They didn't know my name so I wasn't confident in them. It took 5 days for an inmate"" to show me the food pantry. No one called me for dinner. Therapy included, over the course of the week: 2 sessions of coloring (one theme being a comfort castle, 1 being making cards to cheer up the elderly.  I passed on that one being in no mind to give ANYONE positive affirmations.  Ha. What a joke. We did wat h an AA meeting online because of the virus.  We were in a room about 11x11. 5 of us).

So being bipolar in a manic phase I found it hard to advocate for myself. Sorry about the rant above but I kind of feel better now.  I am bipolar, manic and not eating.  Drinking yes. Eating no. They asked me if I smoked crack and I said no but I feel like I just fell thru one."

I'm a little freaked out that not one mental health professional caught on to me. I literally wrote 24-7 and they wouldn't come get me to eat. I begged them for paper and I got it in about 2 piece installments. In the end the staff is now encouraging journaling to their patients.  So I guess that's a good thing."

BipolarReddit,fkimyew,t3_fi8e6f,1584223817.0,"Thanks for this post. 

I'm struggling real hard with all this Virus stuff on top of marital and money problems as well as chronic pain from arthritis.  Dont really have the means to stock up on anything.  I'm trying to stay away from Facebook,  politics,  and people. I want to go to the hospital.  My psychiatrist fired me the week of Christmas.  I was on 4 or 5 meds and am down to a couple l iui Lithium. It's not like I want to kill myself.  I hate my wife but have nowhere to go.  My town is actually a good place for homeless people but all the services are shutting down. I think I'm going to voluntarily stop eating until I shut down. What is so wrong with physician assisted suicide. Suicide sometime seems selfish. I don't think so. Selfish is expecting someone to live a miserable existence daily so YOU don't have to deal with my death. Where are they now? 

I'm gonna text that number this second because I cant take this anymore."

I just wanted to jump in and say I had a very similar experience sitting at the table in the sunshine. It was like an epiphany and I believe I found my true self if only for a moment!

Maybe it was the sunshine.  Maybe it was the fact that I wasn't drinking a six pack every day. So now I am trying to figure out, is this depression that I'm feeling or is it sadness....

I'm rambling. Sorry. Good luck. Stay on Reddit no matter what you do. There are a lot of great people here who know what your going through. My Dr should read this stuff. My wife told me there are a lot of toxic people and negativity on Reddit
