Each one of you is empowered, don't let yourselves succumb to hopelessness and despair. If you're all self aware of each other and have a mask, split your mask up, wear each one of yourselves on the forefront of your mind and try living like that. I had to create a system in myself where each and everyone had a say and purpose. You can achieve collective thinking, I also have many and am telling you this. I achieved it while in therapy and by not letting it get to me. If you want to talk or need help my DMs are open. But dont let anybody tell you you are bad and take it personally. This is your collective journey in your singular body. And I see promise. You can save it all before it all goes away."

Sounds like he's doing it out of spite for you and himself. I would break it off and just get out of there before something bad does happen because he sounds like a psycho path. Tell your friends and family to protect yourself. Btw did you mean Personal Protection Order or something like that? I would do whatever you had to to protect yourself and your children.
