AskUK,fd22hhe,t1_fcx23uj,1578140664.0,"That makes sense. Thank you for explaining it to me this way. 
I come from a country where there is more land available and the laws are different so I was not really aware, which is why I posted here on the first place.
I guess I wanted to know if it would have been a difficult but doable plan or something just unnecessarily hard / close to impossible. I'm starting to think it's the latter. That's fine, I shall find another way to get a home ! 
Sometimes you have to think outside the box but I'm not stuck with this one idea. 
I'm just trying to figure out a day to get on the property ladder, starting with no funds and just a strong desire to make it. I don't wanna be tied up in a 30 year long mortgage or pay rent for the rest of my life."

When it comes to comfort, there are a lot insulation options a d coming from a family of builders I know I will get great advice and support with it. 
It has its limits for sure, but it would get us out of mortgage or rent for life pretty rapidly. The idea of owning the land is also that we could save up a lot of money from not paying rent and eventually use that same land to build a solid house that would be bigger than what we would be able to afford right now. I don't if you get the jist. 
I know most of people think we're a bit out of order with this idea but we are quite smart, creative and handy people and I'm sure it could succeed, I would rather have people telling me right now about all the problems we might encounter so that we can anticipate and not crash and fail for being too naive."

To be completely fair, we don't even have the cash for it right now. It's more so for in a couple of years.

I want to start looking into it as soon as I can to be ahead of all the potential problems (I'm aware there are lots) . Part of me still believe that if we're smart and patient enough, we might be able to find a good deal. It's also a matter of knowing the right people I think."

I didn't not know she was when I first started with her and had I known, I would not have gone with her as I'm an atheist, but she turned out to be a fantastic counselor that helped me a lot. If it wasn't on a her website I would not even have known she was Christian.  Sometimes we can have a bit of prejudice, myself included. 
If this person is qualified counselor, they should be part of the BACP (British Association of Counselors and Psychotherapists) , so that's what you wanna not.
