Anxiety,f9t8x3l,t1_f9sxwql,1575612973.0,"Well, that attachment is what you developed to cope with trauma... And then having to go through cancer, chemo and all that....sounds very traumatic. I think once you get into therapy and start addressing this you'll be able to get back to a more healthy level of attachment in time, it's definitely not impossible."
Anxiety,f9sr849,t3_e6qkpf,1575598617.0,"Yeah you must have some sort of anxious attachment disorder, most likely you developed in the first few months of life.
Look into as much info as you can on attachment theory. Have you seen a therapist?"
ptsd,f9m956r,t1_f9lcumb,1575446943.0,Thank you! That was truly something I needed to hear. Just a little validation goes a long way
abusiveparents,f9lkoyg,t3_e5qquh,1575425463.0,"I understand! Omg I do! Not exactly the same story but I get what it feels like when you just want a mother who will give you comfort and love...but you get the exact opposite. I understand the thing about your baby being taken as punishment. Except my son's father is the one who did that to me, so he was sure I would be completely alone in the world and lose everything I loved. I'm so sorry. I wish I knew how to fix a situation like that but I don't. ☹️"
lonely,f9kh5rd,t3_e5dk5c,1575400353.0,I could have written this myself. I've felt like I didn't belong here since I was a child.
ptsd,f9kekb9,t3_ds8aof,1575398802.0,This is so spot on... I needed to hear that today..
WritingPrompts,f9kcusn,t1_f8wwand,1575397774.0,"Johnny's death isn't ironic to his crime but the situation itself is ironic. He left town without anything but one suitcase that he ""doesn't keep winter clothes in""...and so the irony is the fact that the temperature in the car is freezing and he dies."
manchesterorchestra,f8rqvz7,t3_e1krls,1574749303.0,"Omg I love it!! I have ""Love, come save me"" in cursive on my forearm!"
nosleep,f80vdje,t3_dsnkvw,1574139446.0,"I mean, everybody in the town is always smiling & happy, friendly to each other and giving out homemade baked goods... Sounds a lot better than my shitty life now, I'd be cool with them brainwashing me. Hell yeah Jim can call me champ while we play Yahtzee for the rest of my life."
nosleep,f80rhso,t3_dl6w2i,1574136296.0,"""I don't know what it was but I immediately got the sense that something wasn't right..."" 
Just a shot in the dark here but maybe that sense of depravity and disorder when you walked in were somehow in connection with the fact that you were currently sneaking into your father's house in the middle of the night to torture and murder him???"
nosleep,f7zyawm,t3_ci94do,1574117997.0,Sounds like the beginning of a hella good mini series.
