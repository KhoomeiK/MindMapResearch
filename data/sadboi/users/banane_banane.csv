The next night I couldn't sleep ... and you know the rest. Continued until I stopped the meds, and I felt better almost immediately."

bipolar,f8bqjgz,t1_f8bpgi3,1574443016.0,"You will! Titrating up slowly isn't a barrier to getting better, it's just one of the steps along the way. Everything will work out."
bipolar,f8bphnb,t3_e025e8,1574442317.0,"Usually nausea will go away the longer you take the meds. Just hang in there, mention it to your doctor, and it should go away within a couple weeks."
bipolar,f8bpe8o,t3_e028c8,1574442254.0,You will have to titrate up again. Even when titrating slowly you could develop the rash.
bipolar,f7d7cvf,t3_dvjba2,1573609491.0,"Works wonders, pretty much stopped my cycling right away at the lowest dose. It does make me feel a little blah, but gradually titrating up from 20 to 60mg has helped with that a ton.

Take it with food to help prevent nausea! It's also absorbed more efficiently by the body when you take it with food. Don't eat/drink grapefruit because this can interfere with the dosing."
Rottweiler,f7c3h6o,t3_dv3lnr,1573583580.0,"Make sure he's got stuff to chew otherwise he'll eat up your house! Keep him occupied with training early on, as well - he'll eat it up while he's young and it'll pay off as he gets bigger. Best of luck, enjoy your new little one!! He's beautiful!"

Going on a leave paid for by your employer isn't an option for everyone, but if you're finding it hard to work you might have a case for governmental disability benefits. Check it out and if it's possible, I highly recommend dedicating yourself 100% to your own self care and recovery. It's totally worth it."

bipolar,f4wh91g,t1_f4wgqtg,1571855989.0,"Glad I could help! The lack of passion is tough but definitely manageable if you work with your therapist. A lot of the physical stuff can be managed by take-as-you-need meds, so make sure to mention it to your doctor. Stay strong :)"
bipolar,f4wgaix,t3_dm31do,1571855648.0,"I have the same side effects but can't say that they've lessened at all. I'm currently learning some coping mechanisms to help overcome them - especially the lack of passion. Maybe something to talk about with your therapist. You could talk to them about trying behavioural activation to help with the lack of passion/interest.

Make sure you mention everything you're experiencing, especially your physical symptoms, to your doctor when you see them. They'll be able to give you an idea of whether or not you can expect your symptoms to improve. My experience is that physical symptoms like dizziness and nausea will go away, you just have to give it time. Best of luck friend :)"

bipolar,f3txv0c,t3_di51ip,1571148669.0,"I have the same thing since I started my mood stabilizers. I think it's that since they prevent us from feeling any extreme emotion, we end up with this muted version of everything. I think it's probably a sign your meds are working."

bipolar,f382frk,t1_f36z7n0,1570732854.0,"That was my initial interpretation as well, but my psychologist & doctor have both stressed that not being able to feel *anything* other than angry or anxiety is not normal. It's been almost two months of being almost totally numb, so I hope they're right. Thanks for your input, love your lights analogy!"
bipolar,f36krih,t1_f36k1rc,1570713763.0,"That's what I'm looking for too. I'm stable now but I'm just not ... happy. I just feel kinda meh all of the time, which I thought for a while was normal for non-BPD people. Glad to hear that happiness is possible for us!!"

AmItheAsshole,eyt9fr0,t3_cyj5v1,1567429972.0,"NTA for wanting her to cover household chores. It's just kind of logical that with one income you wouldn't be able to afford a housekeeper, etc. Now, you might be an asshole for saying it in a mean way, but I think you're being totally reasonable here, not to mention a good partner for drastically changing your work schedule so your wife can do what she wants.

If I can offer some advice: I would probably have the same reaction if my partner asked me to cook and clean for him. I would tell her that you didn't mean it as an insult, but that in your mind part of being a stay-at-home parent is household chores - you would do the same if you were to quit your job.

Edit - a word"

bipolar,exja5ke,t1_exj4eqp,1566345347.0,"Good to hear some positive responses to it! I'm on my second day at 20mg and it definitely is making me feel a little wonky - nothing crazy though so I'm still hopeful. I was really loving lamotrigine before I developed the rash. 

I'm sorry you've had to deal with insurance complications. I wish I were there with you to give you some of mine! I'm lucky, I live in Canada so my drugs are paid for by my employer without any questions. 

Are you able to see your primary care doctor more frequently? I'm able to call my doctor and see her the next day if I tell her it's an emergency, but I'm not sure how it works in the (I'm assuming) US. 

If you ever feel like you're struggling, I'm here for you if you need! Feel free to bitch in my inbox! Best of luck with your insurance!!"

I'm not a mental health professional, but I would also recommend reconsidering CBT. Its applications are pretty diverse, whereas my experience with DBT indicates that it's mostly for dealing with conflict created by relationships/interactions with other people.

I know how it feels to catastrophize. I used to do it all the time as well, back when I didn't know I had BPD.
