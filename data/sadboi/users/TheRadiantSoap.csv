The scaling on Ranger abilities is also overall insane compared to other classes.  And the defensive options are powerful enough to keep you alive in every possible fight in the game.  The class is massively self sufficient to the point where pawns actually just get in your way at a certain point.  You can even kill physical immune enemies with Dragon's Glaze if you really felt like it

You can also just potentially one shot anything weaker than a GoreChimera from a mile away

Ranger actually just has no meaningful weaknesses

You've been trying to eat healthier and you've gone an entire 7 days without a single satisfying meal.  Your blood sugar has been fucked and even now you feel like death.  You're waiting in line at the Wendy's outside your office.  The smell of junk food is so alluring to be almost sensual.  You've been next in line for 5 minutes, but the bitch in front of you cannot complete her order.  She is trying to order from a KFC menu she printed out.  Nobody has the courage to call her a moron.  Eventually, she orders a chicken sandwich and the cashier pays for the meal out of her own pocket to avoid fighting over the price.  Finally.  It's finally your turn to order.  The sexual tension between you and your future meal is insane.  Everybody in the Wendy's can feel it.  All eyes are on you.

""2 burger and large fry,"" you say in a sultry tone.  You refuse to say please, because you're that much of a fucking alpha.  Rad.

The cashier blushes.  Upon completing an ocular pat down of the fry cook, you notice he has a massive erection.  Fuck, you can't watch him make your burgers.  That would be gay.  He has such strong and calloused hands that you trust him to cook your food anyway.  Good, being held in those arms would be reassuring in a strictly platonic sense.

Your food is done.  The cashier puts it out on the counter with shaking hands.  You rest your hand on her's to steady her trembling heart.  Every customer is enraptured, not even remembering to breath.  You remove the first box directly onto the counter to assert your dominance over the space.  You almost can't bring  yourself to flip the lid open because you're afraid your satisfaction may be too much.  Almost.

You confidently reveal the culinary masterpiece that will deliver unto you the ultimate pleasure.  You stare lovingly until you literally cannot hold yourself back.  You close your eyes and take a ravenous bite.  It tastes strange, but the flavor is unreal.  It's so fucking moist and grease is literally dribbling off your chin.  You open your eyes.

Held betwixt the buns, there is no patty.  No lettuce.  No tomatoes.  Only CUM

Ounces and ounces of steaming hot seamen slopped into a burger.  Oh fuck, did the fry cook, bust this entire nut himself?   Kinda legendary, bro

You cannot hold yourself back any longer.  Your body is no longer your own.  You greedily shovel the first burger down your gullet.  But you don't forget to say no homo between every sloppy bite.

The next burger.  More cum.  How can a human being produce this volume of fluids?  Impressive.

You move on to the fries; no fries, only cum.

You are not disappointed

Now you have a taste for cum

The cashier interrupts your reverie by uttering ancient wisdom, ""Sir, this is a Wendy's,""  she said.  Of course.  You lost yourself in the spectacle and forgot to clean your trash off the counter.  You carry it to the receptacle while everyone claps
