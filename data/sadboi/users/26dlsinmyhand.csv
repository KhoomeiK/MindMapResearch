I complained a lot with my friends, and we felt bad about how the trilogy turned out, so I didn‚Äôt see it for another time, and that‚Äôs it. Every time I think about TROS, I still feel that it‚Äôs such a shame. I understand that people feel bad, but what‚Äôs attacking the actors online gonna do anything? They were not even involved in the writing process. Also, 4 months have passed, you can‚Äôt possibly be still thinking about that movie everyday right? Ep1 and Ep2 are also bad (at least in my opinion). It happens. Not every Star Wars movie can live up to our expectations. Almost every franchise has at least a bad movie. It‚Äôs disappointing, but it‚Äôs not the first time that something like this happened. Move on."
