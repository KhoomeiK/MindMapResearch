90DayFiance,fcizm5h,t3_ehforg,1577673632.0,He just wants to know she‚Äôs okay. Basic communication. He‚Äôs literally by himself with her mother and she‚Äôs out partying in another country. She should be happy to have someone who cares about her dammit. She is so immature it‚Äôs hard to watch.
Anxiety,f9odbjs,t3_e5zco5,1575501851.0,Yes. It‚Äôs one of my top fears. And a big part of my job is making/receiving phone calls. It does get easier the more you do it. I kinda had to just force myself to get better at it. I would get so much anxiety if I had to make a call. It would take me hours to try even attempting to make one and I would constantly overthink the situation. I started just trying my best not to overthink and just call. It‚Äôs never really as bad as you make it out in your head.

relationships,f4fv581,t3_dkbbdz,1571574755.0,I had a friend who would text me when she knew I was out with people depressing things including how she felt like she wanted to kill her self. One time I was at my sisters bridal shower and she started texting me. It was always when the attention wasn‚Äôt on her. You‚Äôre gf seems very insensitive and just wanted your attention. She should have understood how important that weekend was for you. You should definitely talk to her about it even though time has passed. Sometimes it takes time to think about what happened especially after grieving your father. It seems like she has a lot of growing to do. I‚Äôm so sorry about your father.
