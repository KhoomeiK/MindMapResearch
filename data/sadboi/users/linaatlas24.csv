Anxiety,fghn668,t1_fghj0lz,1580788686.0,I take it for this too and last night I took one because I was too anxious to go to sleep. Makes sense. Thanks for your input.

epidemiology,ffpeehx,t3_euf6ob,1580092972.0,Wow! I didn’t know I would get so many suggestions. Good news is I have a data input heavy job and a long commute so I’ll have plenty of time to check all of them out. Thanks!
Anxiety,fdluyzb,t3_em148q,1578533111.0,"I took it a couple of years ago. It helped with my anxiety but I gained lot of weight very quickly and coming off of it was literally the worst experience I’ve ever had in my life. Brain zaps, nausea, dizziness, migraines, etc. Those lasted for several weeks before my panic attacks ensued and I started a different medication."
1200isplenty,fdifkia,t1_fdhzmf4,1578441774.0,Not in Australia but I’ll have to try the homemade kind.

femalehairadvice,fdfqg3s,t1_fdfh9rf,1578367731.0,Yeah my natural hair color isn’t really blonde but not a deep brown. I’ve wanted to go deep auburn for years.

boardgames,fc7m5gh,t1_fc70qq1,1577511966.0,Thank you. I used Minwax Dark Walnut. I only applied one coat. It was darker than expected but you can still see the numbers well. I also used a gloss clear Krylon sealer but it didn’t add much shine as you can see.
boardgames,fc692vu,t1_fc61o6k,1577475092.0,Looks great.
boardgames,fc690yl,t1_fc60zf5,1577475057.0,The particle board that the player mats are in soak it up and we put serval coats of spray gloss sealer on afterwards. All of it is completely dry to the touch!

macbookpro,erm1ejx,t1_erlk5el,1561002896.0,"In order to get a MPA 2018, would I get it refurbished/used? I assume the new ones are 2019."
macbookpro,erm17wg,t1_erlld9b,1561002730.0,Very interesting idea. I will look into it!
macbookpro,erm16qt,t1_erltkt0,1561002702.0,I had considered that but wasn’t sure. Do you think the ram would need to be upgraded?
macbookpro,erm0zkc,t1_erlkni9,1561002523.0,Thank you. This might be a dumb question but in order to get the 2018 do I need to buy refurbished? I assume the ones offered new right now are 2018.
