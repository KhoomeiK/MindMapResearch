The day I started a white vinegar rinse was the day I stopped losing 200+ hairs a day. My condition has taken a complete 180 turn.

Second of all, nothing is stopping you from wearing rainbows right this moment. The reason people sometimes act like gay is a “personality trait” is probably from the hundreds of years of persecution lgbt people have suffered globally. The lgbt community fought long and HARD for the right to be seen and accepted today and there is still a lot of fighting left to do. I am assuming you know absolutely nothing about the struggles and losses people suffered in order for lgbt people to have the acceptance and visibility they have today or you would have never even considered posting that comment. 

Nothing is stopping you from wearing a freaking rainbow. Trust me your skin won’t melt off if you do. A rainbow is a naturally occurring phenomenon, just like being gay. It is a symbol of pride and each stripe represents something important. I genuinely hope every time you see a rainbow for the rest of your life you think of gayness."

SebDerm,fpx222k,t3_gfzvd3,1588974186.0,"First of all, I am so so sorry. I know exactly what you’re going through because I was going through the same thing for about two years. I mean, fistfuls of hair would come out all day long. 

The way I got it fixed took a considerable amount of trial and error. I don’t know what caused it but I suspect it was most likely a combination of stress, hard water, and shitty hair products. I tried sulfate free products, boar bristle brushing to disperse hair oils, cutting out all malassezia irritants, several medicated shampoos, even minoxidil. Nothing worked at all and my hair loss was actually increasing.

Here’s what helped: vinegar. Diluted white or apple vinegar in about a 1:4 ratio poured directly onto my wet hair and scalp before shampooing and then massaging my scalp and rinsing. It literally changed my life. My shedding has gone from 200 strands a day to maybe 50. I wash my hair about twice a week and use malassezia safe shampoo. I also went and got a full blood work up (almost a year ago along with several follow ups) and they checked for literally everything including diabetes and tissue disorders. I do have PCOS and am on 100mg spironolactone which helps hair loss but honestly I didn’t see a single change happen until I started washing with vinegar. I also take vitamin d and iron supplements as well since they were a little low in my work up but once again the only thing that really truly made a visible and physical difference was just a splash of vinegar. 

I know that everyone is different but I really hope you try it out and that it works for you. Some people say you have to wash with the vinegar every day but I’ve found success at just 2-3x a week. It’s so frustrating because I wasted a lot of money on all these products that seemed to just worsen my condition when the solution for me ended up being so cheap and simple."

I’m not sure if they still sell the correct size but it worked for a couple months while we treated the hotspot and let her fur regrow a bit. I’m sure something similar to this in a size xs or s would fit and be hard to wiggle out of. The arm holes fall at pretty much the right spot and are nice and small. The back extended pretty far down but didn’t cover her back entirely so this would be ideal if the hotspot is a bit higher up on her back.

SebDerm,fp45bt3,t1_fp40txl,1588291992.0,"It’s for hydration and moisture. People with seb derm can’t use most oils (olive or castor or jojoba for example which are very popular in hair and skin care) because they feed the malasezzia fungus which produces the flakes and scales. You can use the squalane/mct oil after a wash to hydrate your scalp and roots in a way that will not make your seb derm flare up. I have noticed many people apply the squalane or mct oil after a wash  if they use a drying medicated shampoo. 

Of course, everyone is different but I believe it is worth a try! I have also heard the hada labo gokujyun hyaluronic acid lotion helps with moisturizing the face as well as the scalp but I have not tried it yet."

The vinegar is the only thing that helped me at all. I tried medicated shampoos as well but they dried my scalp too much. 

I rinse with a diluted 1:3 vinegar to water mixture after getting my hair wet and then scrub it into my scalp for about a minute and then wash it out. I have heard others have had great success using a shampoo brush as well. I do this every time I wash my hair which is now about two to three times a week. It has the added benefit of making my hair as soft and silky as it’s ever been! Typically I do the vinegar rinse before shampoo in case I use a medicated shampoo (I use nizoral or sebclair once in a while) because it breaks up the biofilm and allows the medication to work better. My non-medicated shampoo is Trader Joe’s tea tree tingle and it’s really great and safe for use with seb derm."

Fencesitter,fo9su8l,t3_g62q97,1587629944.0,"Personally, I would rather regret not having a child than regret bringing a life into this world that  I cannot properly raise. A child is a LIFELONG commitment. You will be connected to that child and their other parent for the rest of you life. They will be completely dependent on you for at least two decades. You will have to make tremendous sacrifices in your life to ensure your child is happy and healthy. Sacrifices you aren’t even aware you will have to make. Not to mention the physical toll on your body and the risk of death and disfigurement you face carrying a child and then giving birth. I’m talking LIFELONG physical consequences. I see a lot of people saying “you will never be 100% certain” and I just absolutely cannot relate to that. A kid isn’t a toy. They don’t exist for you to see what you and your partner would look like combined. That is a whole individual person that you are completely responsible for until they are able to eventually go out on their own. They will not be some perfect little combination of genes, they will be a completely unpredictable human being with their own thoughts, opinions, and whatnot. ALSO: what if your child is special needs? You might have to take care of them indefinitely. You might even have to employ someone else to take care of them for you. These are just some things to consider."

askwomenadvice,fnrfubv,t3_g3bk6s,1587187686.0,"Yeah but it was kind of different from what you describe. I met him online when I was home from college. I went back to school after break and met my current boyfriend who I’ve been with for 4 years. I still stayed really friendly with the first guy though and since I’d actually made some casual friends off the app I decided to hang out with him again because he seemed pretty cool and we got along pretty well for strangers who met on a dating app. 

While I was home for winter break he invited me to a party or a get-together at his house and I was like sure I’ll go I’d like to hang out and meet new people and escape from my family. Unfortunately it was really just him and his like 4 housemates. I was kind of uncomfortable but I was determined to have a good time so I was trying to keep up with them. I got really drunk really fast and then at the time I was an extremely inexperienced weed smoker (I was only 18 at the time) and I got wayyyy too high and disoriented. He took me up to his bedroom which was a fucking air mattress on the floor with a tv on a shelf and he well..... I still have a hard time watching planet earth. 

It was one of the worst experiences of my life. I had panic attacks almost every day for a while, and I would get into these blind panics whenever I smoked for months afterwards and it affected my intimacy with my boyfriend. I feel extremely dirty when I think about it even now. I feel like I was really naive and taken advantage of, but I still can’t help but think I should have known better. Unfortunately It made me understand people and the world a little better and I am no longer that same person I was four years ago. I am very happy now and have thankful been able to mostly forget about that night and move on. My boyfriend is the best person in the world and I feel extremely lucky that he loves me and cares for me."

Antipsychiatry,fmu20rd,t3_fx5vxj,1586383097.0,"I am fortunate enough to have never been institutionalized or forced on medications, but I was coerced by a doctor after my first visit with her. I told her going in that I was not willing to go on any medications. She said I understand but you pretty much need them. I was also being pressured by my mother who told me I was broken for being depressed so I caved in and was put on Prozac. Worst mistake of my entire life. 

The only thing that doctor ever did for me was ruin my life and hand me worksheets about positive thinking. Every time I came back in to see her, she seemed to have forgotten what we talked about the week before. That was my first clue that this was all bullshit. Then my dose got doubled after two weeks of “not feeling the effects” and I began to lose weight rapidly. Over the course of about two months I dropped from 120 lbs to under 100. Being 96 lbs when you’re 5’7 is terrifying. Beyond the weight loss I was experiencing other terrifying side effects. Racing heart, constant tremors and shaking and twitching, nightmares when I managed to fall asleep, cold sweats, problems breathing and eating, constant drowsiness, diarrhea, and my periods stopped for almost a year. These are just the ones I remember off the top of my head 4 years later. Mind you this is all taking place at the same time with increasing severity each day. 

The mental side effects started to hit a little bit after the physical ones. I stopped being able to make memories. I barely remember a lot of things that happened during this time which makes me feel disgusting. It felt like I was watching someone else live their life through a tv screen, but I was outside the house peering into their living room window to watch it (if that makes any sense at all). I was so disjointed from who I was, what I was doing, and what I was thinking. It felt like everything was happening in slow motion and all the sounds were muffled. I don’t think I felt a single emotion besides deep and constant despair. I don’t want to talk too much about it but I went through my lowest points during this time. 

I ended up forcing myself to taper off on my own. During this time I would feel sick with flu or food poisoning symptoms despite eating nothing but oatmeal every day. I would be writhing on the bathroom floor for hours unable to do anything. Fortunately I gained weight back and most of my physical symptoms disappeared within a few months but the mental damage is permanent. I ended up dropping out of school because I just couldn’t do anything anymore. All the progress I had made by myself with no doctors or drugs to manage my emotions was completely wiped away. I went to this doctor for help and it ended up completely ruining my life. I only took those pills for a few months but the effects have lingered years beyond the last dose. I can’t put it into words too well but my mind just feels like it was scrambled and bruised and I don’t know how to fix it."

SebDerm,fmkvjdu,t3_fvui2u,1586170284.0,My doctor prescribed me a 15% azelaic acid ointment. Have you given that a try? I am also washing my face with sulfur soap once a day before applying the ointment.
Cooking,fmkvemz,t1_fmkv4vv,1586170144.0,"In the apple cole slaw recipe you posted, it calls for a red bell pepper.... the thing that the original commenter had on their shopping list that was replaced with apples. Just thought that was funny."
Cooking,fmkv2hn,t1_fmkuuy6,1586169782.0,"Yes, substitutions. That’s why I mentioned the part about the pepper sections. Poblano, bell,jalapeño, shishito, cubanelle, Fresno, habanero, wax... I could even see substituting peppers for zucchini or celery for some strange reason and I would be less confused. But apples? No."
Cooking,fmkurqf,t1_fmkqvtw,1586169459.0,"Yes I understand that different ingredients can be used in many different ways but that still doesn’t mean that you can just sub out peppers for apples in any random recipe calling for peppers. Chances are if someone has peppers on their shopping list they have a plan already of how and when they will use the peppers. Usually supermarkets have many different pepper varieties to choose from, none of which resemble an apple in any way shape or form."

SPD,fmkjz98,t3_fvr2ng,1586157570.0,"Can you tolerate earplugs? They sell them at gas stations and Walmart. Try putting those in and then using over-ear headphones with music. Or maybe lay on your side with two pillows sandwiching your head while you listen to music. If you work on it in steps (take off panel, remove old batteries, replace batteries, replace panel) you could have it done in a few increments. 

For me, making my own humming sound helps me focus on what I’m doing a bit more and seems to dull outside sounds a little."
wholesomememes,fmixx21,t3_fv3xgb,1586119135.0,"Weird how it only took one session with my psychologist to determine I needed to be on brain altering pills. I ended up almost dying after taking them for less than a year. My body weight dropped to under 100lbs and I am 5’7. I couldn’t sleep at night because I would constantly sweat and have vivid nightmares. I experienced every side effect possible short of seizures. I eventually quit after tapering off them myself and man it was hellish. Every time my dose went down I would be sick with flu like symptoms for a day or two and I couldn’t leave the bathroom floor. It also completely stopped my period and caused me to need to see a gynecologist to give me progesterone to remind my body to menstruate. 

Besides all the physical symptoms I experienced the deepest, most miserable depression I have ever experienced. Typically when I am depressed I feel sadness. When I was depressed on meds, I can’t even explain what I felt. All I can say is it felt like I was inside a fish bowl 24/7 barely able to see or hear or even breathe. I was so uncaring and numb that the thought of suicide didn’t make me feel scared or doubtful. I really don’t know how I made it through those months. 

I wasn’t myself for maybe a year or two after that. I think that my brain got really messed up from those few months. Before being on meds I had been making progress by myself and I was working towards being happier and more thoughtful of my emotions. Now I don’t even have the drive to do any of that. Now I am stuck in a loop of hopeless misery."

AskVet,fmebf7h,t3_fupo1a,1585997480.0,"I am not a vet but from my understanding it is pretty normal for cats to have thinner/less hair in the area between their eye and ear. It is, however, always best to double-check with a vet to make sure there are no other medical issues as there can be some conditions that exacerbate the hair loss. Is there a way to talk to a vet over phone or video? Is your cat’s skin red or inflamed in that area?"
