Golf_R,fqwq16y,t1_fqwpyh6,1589713670.0,Lol just read it in full — bug happens when all four tires lose pressure at same instant. I think you’d notice.
Golf_R,fqwpyh6,t3_glbnb2,1589713592.0,More details from the VW site. Apparently it would be a software update. Annoying that they can’t do it over the air. I’m just going to have it done next time my car is in for service and check my pressures myself sometimes https://ibb.co/PgVfXT4
BPD,fnb1qve,t3_g0puu9,1586807696.0,"Yeah I call them dysphoric episodes, lol sounds like a technical term but it’s just something I made up. It’s a mystery how I get into them but also a mystery how I get out!"
BPD,fn7s3ak,t3_g04wns,1586726500.0,Are you an anxious person? Caffeine can make that a lot worse.
dogs,fixrfoe,t1_fixliku,1582825466.0,"I gotta say Havanese are pretty sturdy, despite being so very cute. Real rough n tumble blue collar type dogs, just with a cute face"
dogs,fi12bwx,t1_fi11cwv,1582049235.0,"Ok, so we have a 6 month old that we’ve had for 3 months. He still has accidents. I think we might have had more success except that we take him to different apartments / houses a lot and he doesn’t know where “outside” is in each. Also we never tried to crate. My sister also has one (even younger) and is crating and having more success but hers still has accidents. I don’t have an adult hav in my life but a coworker with one uses indoor peepads which I would not want to do."
dogs,fi10vs7,t1_fi0zhj5,1582048461.0,"I can’t speak for other breeds. I guess you have to just be prepared. If you can mentally cope with needing to clean up sometimes, then just do your best and positively reinforce success and it should get better and better."
dogs,fi07m1k,t3_f5kwoh,1582029322.0,"Havanese look delicate but they are real rough n tumble blue collar dogs. Really enjoy a scamper and a wrestle with other dogs. They won’t keep up jogging for long distances but otherwise quite energetic. So friendly, so attached. You have to do some training around boundaries like not allowing on bed, not barking for attention but that should come naturally so long as you are aware. Very much recommend. Only significantly difficult thing is potty training."
Golf_R,fgnwv1x,t3_ezjnk4,1580954648.0,I leave my car with valets in covered garages a lot and it annoys me with phone notifications about windows being open and rain being forecast (valets always keep driver side window open). Right now it is incorrectly saying I’m running low on gas when actually I just filled up. Maybe one day it might be useful but there’s no way I would pay for it. The car is secure enough and your smart phone can remember where you parked.
Golf_R,fff1zqv,t3_eta3px,1579873517.0,"Car was much lower? Just move on, get one that hasn’t been molested. This is an 8 year old popular model, there must be loads of good ones out there."
Golf_R,ff1sn4q,t1_ff1sgzo,1579485286.0,"Nice, that’s exactly what I got on mine now"
Golf_R,ff1sbb8,t3_er61tu,1579485078.0,New? Mine came with conti sport contacts which I wouldn’t dare in the snow
Golf_R,fdkq894,t3_eluza5,1578508883.0,31k in NY... is that the red one in Manhattan lol?
Golf_R,fdga498,t1_fdg9ibc,1578386677.0,Thanks. Yeah I feel like the VW warranties are generous for that reason too. I’ve been calling around and found a good offer a few states away. Now hoping I can get a local dealer to match it. Otherwise I’ll have a little road trip which might be fun actually.
Golf_R,fdf9q3r,t1_fdezqu7,1578356596.0,Thanks. I looked and yes they are the best prices I’ve seen. I called and it’s for real (although the really good prices you can only get if you go with their financing)
Golf_R,fdekqfg,t1_fdeeucx,1578341097.0,It’s a DSG? That’s a good deal I think based on what I’m hearing calling around now.
Golf_R,fdebq61,t1_fdea96z,1578335539.0,Do you mind me asking which dealer?
Golf_R,fde7jzf,t1_fde61z1,1578332906.0,Thanks. That’s the exact spec I want (in grey or blue tho). I guess everything is more expensive where I am (NYC).
Golf_R,fde5cx5,t3_ekf2dv,1578331534.0,"Looks great, I’m looking to get this color too. Did you pay sticker or get a discount?"
