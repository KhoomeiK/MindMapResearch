Then one day I found out from someone else he got scammed thousands because he got a phone call from “IRS” and they said he needed to pay with gift cards so he went to target and purchased a ton of gift cards. He lost a lot of money because of this scam. This may sound shallow but it made me feel better about myself. I’m not that stupid.
relationship_advice,fofn7ar,t1_fof92hn,1587739286.0,I was thinking the same. Sometimes sexual abuse is learned behavior. A lot of sexual offenders report of sexual abuse when they were children. He could most definitely be watching pornography. But his parents need to do the right thing and actually parent that kid. Sit him down and tell him what’s appropriate and what not. Sounds like that OPs sister is babying him and that’s practically reinforcing that behavior. He thinks he can get away with it. I think if he old enough to act this inappropriately he’s old enough to get a good scolding. I can’t believe his mother is this way. I really hope OP is the better person in this situation and calls the police. I really hope OP straight up tells him “that is sexual assault” because it seems like his actual parents don’t do shit for parenting. Also child protective services needs to be called in my opinion. This definitely screams learned behavior. There’s is a good chance he was sexually abused and that the daughter is sexually abused.

TechNewsToday,fmzr521,t1_fmwewg2,1586527785.0,"Because the flu mutates and scientists basically have to predict what kind of flu will be most prominent. That is also why you can get the flu after getting the flu shot. But in the US a lot of infectious diseases have almost became eradicated like diphtheria, bacterial influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and tetanus etc. Though there’s many more cases showing up due to antivaxxers. Also ingredients like formaldehyde are naturally occurring in the body.  It is a by-product of an essential reaction inside our own cells. It’s kills viruses and inactivates toxins in the vaccine. The amount of formaldehyde present in some vaccines is so small compared to the concentration that occurs naturally in the body that it does not pose a safety concern. That’s one example of the ingredients that have a purpose in vaccines. Why would we inject vaccines into people that have no preservatives. That’s what would make the virus or bacteria unstable and possibly grow. All a vaccine is doing is helping your body adapt an immunity by helping it recognize the weaken infection. You can do it the hard way though. Go find someone who’s sick, get sick yourself and develop an immunity. Just like what the antivaxxers have recommend. Google about polio, google about these diseases that we are trying to eradicate. They are awful awful diseases. Before submersing yourself in a particular opinion research both sides of the argument. Read actual scientific journals from scientists who have a good rep. Do more reasearch from both sides."
