I have a family whatsapp group (like most people do) where we share a lot of information regarding this Covid19. Sometimes there are fake news so we normally educate or ignore ridiculous message like this. Anyway, one of the message we received is regarding the information on 3 infected person which stay at my hometown. For me normally is ok, but when my sister saw this message she said that she just had a meeting with this particular person who was infected by his colleague from tabligh and he didn't know too. As my sister and her colleague had meeting in a close room for about 1 hour with this particular person, she's considered as close contact, and she went to get tested. 

What I want to say here is, if these information like name and address of this patient made known to us, we won't even know that my sister need to get tested for Covid19. Especially since she didn't have any symptom but so do most people. If she didn't see the name but just information of some people who work from here or there she won't go to get tested and that's normal, and I don't think KKM have access to all the contact especially if they don't work at the same place. Now I'm considering that the data or maybe at least name and location of the infected patients are made public."
