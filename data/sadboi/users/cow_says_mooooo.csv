StopGaming,fpwd2oc,t3_gfq50g,1588961321.0,"My parents bought gaming laptops for my brothers and I before attending college. I feel like a normal pc (what even is that if you don't like MacBook) would be fine. Some of our family still has shit computers that take an hour  to startup sometimes and every action on them is prolonged multiple seconds which is even more frustrating for those that don't know how to use a computer. They've had this garbage computer for long and won't buy another. 

I've been thru gaming addiction and probably still am. It's fun. I don't see myself quitting soon though. Just why did you spend over a thousand dollars to buy me a computer specifically for gaming (so it can handle the most demanding Google doc or word usage etc-... Is their reasoning)

I didn't game on it for two weeks and they kinda asked me ""what, no gaming yet?"" 
I found myself giving in a few days after. 

What other pc options could they have gone with- I think they spent between 1k-2k on it, so what high performance business laptop (around 1k) could substitute? 

Not that it matters now, I'll just try moderation and other activities to physically and mentally tire me out to limit gaming. Or just don't think about it or punish myself. I'll get that thing i wanted to do eventually."
