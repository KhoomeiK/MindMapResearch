modernwarfare,fqema32,t1_fqeklzk,1589309906.0,"Launchers: In general, Ground War is the best bet for a bunch of killstreaks to shoot down.

* Do the **JOKR** first because it is definitely the most frustrating one and it's a good idea to get that one out of the way. Shipment 24/7, Domination modes are what I found the easiest to get the attacker/defender/kill camos done on it. The frustrating part of the JOKR is it is extremely slow to take down killstreaks after your rocket launches. Anyone running a Strela or PILA on your team can easily beat you to them even if you shoot first. 

* The second most annoying launcher is the **RPG** because it's super inaccurate when shooting aerial killstreaks. It's best to focus on shooting down Counter UAVs, Personal Radars and VTOLs due to the fact that they sit still for long periods. Kills with the RPG are super easy and you can use it anywhere. Domination and Hardpoint are best for attacker/defender kills, small maps are best (the current Shoot the Rusty Ship playlist would be great).

* **Strela** kills can be tough because it has a very small blast radius. I took it to Hardcore to get the kill requirements done, or you could just aim for direct hits because it is a very fast launcher. The Strela shines against killstreaks. It's a 2 hit kill on VTOLs. Only thing you'll have to worry about is *just* slightly leading UAVs when you shoot at them.

* **PILA** is by far the easiest launcher to do. Does decent damage against players and has a super quick lock-on and a very fast rocket. Just fire and forget. 

**Riot Shield**: Shipment is your friend. Take it to Hardcore, go to the middle crate (by the B flag) and drop a deployable cover in the middle of it to block your victim's escape. Camp in the back corner and cheese the spawn point that's in there. I got the 25 three-kill streaks done in an hour using this method. You'll have to sacrifice some K/D though because people love to hunt down riot shield users with thermites. If Shipments not available you pretty much just have to corner camp all the time and hope lol.

**Knife**: Seems difficult on the surface but it's actually really easy with smoke grenades. It's a one hit kill and you fly around the map with a knife out and Dead Silence active. Just smoke an area where enemies are and get to slashin'."
modernwarfare,fqekchj,t1_fqedo9j,1589308988.0,It's fuckin' easy compared to the launcher gold camos/all other Obsidian challenges haha. Literally just shoot down 100 Killstreaks. I just ran a PILA and took the ghost perk off my classes to incentivize myself into shooting down UAVs.
