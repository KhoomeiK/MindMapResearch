Makes you wanna sit back, enjoy the life
And do things you like doing, get to shine

But I gotta do it, they always stay outta line
Sometimes I wanna just chill and land
But I'm the protector of the Emeralds and gems
I stay knuckled up, I'm in a deep cut
I'm seeing skulls that burn, they trying to cut me off
Avoiding my luck, I'm feeling kinda stuck
I'm in narrow hallways running like it's a ballgame
Hand tracks be trackin' me to different doorways
In a maze, and I don't know what to do
Guaranteed though, Imm'a find the Emeralds
Don't call me Knuckles for nothing, I can't lose!"

A Tako Bhel 'nacho taco' (which has since been discontinued!!) Is a relatively simple dish: it consists of seasoned ground beef, nacho cheese, shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese and red corn chip pieces. For the nacho cheese I used a popular chip brands jarred cheese dip. For the corn chip pieces I used Paqui ghost pepper chips although Taki pieces would look more authentic. I browned ground beef on medium heat in a pan with a really small amount of olive oil and 'taco seasoning' that i assume was cumin onion garlic chili powder and salt with maybe a few others. Probably MSG too. When it was pretty much done I added a generous spoonful of cannabutter and stirred until the crumbles were coated then turned the burner off. Heat up the cheese dip, then in the taco shells put a decent amount of da weed beef, a bit more than half full, then add the heated nacho cheese, ice berg lettuce and chip pieces. Boom now you have a taco that tastes almost exactly like taco bell and gets you high."

Standardized Magnolia Bark Extract, Black Cumin Seeds, Valerian and Noble Kava have all work for me but are no replacement for professional help imo. Usually using one or 2 of those (and some doxylamine if I'm in Really bad shape) will get me calm enough to focus on an audio book or something else I can use to get my mind off it
