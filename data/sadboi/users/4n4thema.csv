AmItheAsshole,fpgdbsm,t1_fpgcjyz,1588600337.0,"I'm not really being naked, but I dislike wearing bras when I'm at home as it is uncomfortable. But every damn day they bring guests uninvited and especially their boyfriends who walk around the house like they own it. They even stay there even if my housemates aren't there. I've never really called them out much but when I get to a certain level of being pissed too much because they keep being insensitive to others that's when I get angry.

Also in my case and OP's she did say that she's wearing an oversized shirt and some panties, which do cover most of the stuff. Despite that, having uninvited visitors in your home or safe space can be quite annoying. Imagine just wanting to rest but you have to deal with them giggling in the room, fighting in the living room, using amenities like they live there especially when my housemates are not even there.

I did say in my previous comment that they are free to have visitors as long as they announce that someone's coming just at least the people who live in the house gets a heads up. In my case tbh I'm not only pissed about their boyfriends constantly hanging out and literally living in our apartment, but with the fact that they are also messy. I've had to clean dirty dishes piled for months, throw away rotting food with molds and/or maggots and generally keeping the house clean. I do feel I'm at least entitled to have a say because I'm the one who keeps our house from being chaotic and smelly. I'm civil and sometimes friendly with their visitors but I just hope they also have to respect the other inhabitants of the house"
AmItheAsshole,fpfw31e,t3_gd3855,1588585706.0,"Honestly though, I also live in an apartment with 4 other girls. It's kinda expensive to turn the AC on every damn time even if it's hot so I usually dress like that too. My problem though is that 4 of those girls constantly bring their boyfriends every day, and most of them usually let them sleep over every day. 

I'm not confrontational so I don't call them out that bad, but I do drop some comments about it. They get all mad because they say they have a right to have guests over since they pay rent and bills. But I also do too, and I'm the one who actually lives here. I think you should stand up to your housemates and tell them that you don't agree to it at all. It can be really annoying for guests or boyfriends to stay there all the time, but she should at least have the common courtesy to inform you guys whenever he is coming so you could dress up. That way you can still dress however you want and not get surprised when he suddenly shows up.

Obviously not an asshole to stand up for your rights and to assure your comfort in a house where you pay bills and rent."
antidepressants,fpelixc,t1_fpekqg2,1588549874.0,"Well since I'm no professional you might want to consult your doctor about it, because it would usually depend on the type of medicine and dose you currently take. If it's not possible though, I do think it will be easier for you to taper since you've only been taking it for a short amount of time. Just start taking your meds in half, then in quarters, then you can stop"
antidepressants,fpekact,t1_fpejsmo,1588549183.0,"I still think it's important to do it instead of doing it cold turkey. 2 months is fairly a long enough time for your body to already get used to the meds because you take them everyday.

I've also read that antidepressant withdrawal is possible if you abruptly stop taking an antidepressant, particularly if you've been taking it longer than four to six weeks.

Better to be safe than suffer the consequences though."
mentalhealth,fpej6bo,t3_gcy9jg,1588548575.0,"Hey, I can't imagine how you must be feeling right now. But do remember that it's not entirely your fault. You were mentally ill, she was too. It's really hard to point hands when there was this much miscommunication that happened. You shouldn't entirely blame yourself too much because you couldn't possibly know what was really going on and you were busy coping by yourself. It's not a crime to take care of yourself.

 This kinda served as a reminder for me too because I've recently isolated myself from people, including my SO. He's also having mental health problems and this made me rethink that maybe I shouldn't completely shut him off since he's having a hard time coping too. But I just want to make sure I'm well enough before talking to people as to not inconvenience them and to be capable enough to help them.

Anyways, I hope you are staying safe. I wish all the best for you. Don't lose your fight op."
antidepressants,fpehr9t,t3_gd01i5,1588547796.0,"I suggest you finish up the last month since it's about to be finished anyways. Also you were definitely prescribed that long for a reason. To some people, it takes longer for them to feel the positive effects of medication or they may not notice at all.

Like for me, I thought that it only made me feel numb and stuff and I stopped for a few days, weeks even, and that's when I realized how much it's been helping me. It made me feel really bad and have depressive episodes, that's how I knew it actually was working but not that obviously.

If ever you do plan to completely stop, I suggest you taper off it slowly instead of cold turkey."
antidepressants,fpecx5w,t3_gcymcp,1588545036.0,"I actually did the opposite and took antidepressants when I was in a really bad place instead for waiting when I'm stable. For me, if I was stable then I don't really needed them badly yet. I actually stopped taking them countless times, but eventually went back to taking them because I was spiraling down and becoming very unstable.

I found that usually, it helped bring back stability into my life or at least make days bearable and tasks doable. Antidepressants honestly has different effects for everyone, but I think based on what you said you might actually need them even more now. Talk to your psychiatrist and tell them your concerns about it so they can prescribe you what's the best meds they think that will work for you. 

I've also felt really suicidal before starting them and really unstable af, but when I did take them I didn't really do anything rash. It takes a lot getting used to and may be rough when starting due to some side effects but it'll settle quickly. For some though they dont feel side effects that badly so it's also a possibility for you.

Maybe you could inform your loved ones, support system or a few trusted people that you'll be starting meds so you can have a little bit of accountability to them. They can also help monitor you and you can even go to them if you struggle."
