EatingDisorders,f8uk8aa,t3_dqzcjg,1574832217.0,"Calorie counting honestly was the thing that set off my ED I was already in a mindset of losing weight and counting made it worse. 

While in recovery I watched alot of ED coaches on YouTube and by far my favorite has been Tabitha Farrar, She honestly helped my recovery she covers all sorts of topics from bloating, weight gain, food guilt to exercise after recovery and so much more I really do recommend watching her when your having a bit of doubt and thinking about relapse. And please stay strong ðŸ’ª"
