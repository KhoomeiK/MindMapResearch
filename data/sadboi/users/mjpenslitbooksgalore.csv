Hello all

I recently acquired some beautiful lilac T-shirt yarn. I have never worked with this sort of yarn before and so of course i scoured the Internet for what i could make with it. I did find lots of patterns but my question is if i can use it with any pattern? Sorry if this is a dumb question but i couldn‚Äôt find the answer and i have a tank top pattern i wanted to try with it. I know i could just try it but i don‚Äôt want to ruin the yarn. So i just wanted to know if anyone had some experience with the t-shirt yarn or any advice? 

Thank you."

Yea of course sometimes i get frustrated thats normal, but i dont have the energy to hate him. all my energy and focus goes to my mental health and my son. its NOT easy. but once you just let go, things will get better.

bonus once they realize you dont even hate them anymore, it bothers them more than you think. my crazy ex will do anything to try and  get a rise out of me now, but i dont let him."
