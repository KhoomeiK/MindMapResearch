But if heads of state and the leaders of these companies had heeded these warnings even 30 or 40 years ago and put policies into effect to lessen their environmental impact, we'd all be a lot better off."

The smell is another thing. As a rule of thumb, if it smells bad enough to make you gag, don't eat it. Could it be another ingredient causing the mixed product to spoil? If you're mixing older vegetables in with your chickpeas, that could be the problem. Mixed recipes are only as good as their oldest ingredient."
