LucidDreaming,f96z7yd,t3_e3viu9,1575155526.0,"Mine is from 5-20-2018 

So in the dream, there was a group of us that were kidnapped by this weird shadow organization. Chris S, me, and some elderly Chinese woman.

I woke up in a hospital bed in a room by myself. I pulled off the monitoring equipment that was attached to my skin.

I went to the next room, but only peeked in and saw a doctor and nurses around the bed with the elderly Chinese woman.

The doctor said, ""Ok. Terminate her."" Then the nurse brought over a syringe and injected the lady with it. She died.

I ran down the hallway and found you in a room, Chris was on a hospital bed unconscious. I overhead the nurses in the hallway saying, ""He is a viable test subject.""

Then I unhooked Chris from all the monitoring things. I slapped his face, ""Wake up. We're in trouble.""

Chris was very drowsy, I had to support him and help him walk out of the hospital.

A black SUV pulled up. It looked like the Chinese woman was driving. It was her twin sister. She yelled at us to get in.

Then Chris laid your head on my lap and fell asleep in the SUV.

The driver said that Chris had something special in his blood, and that is why the corporation was after him. Her sister was a mismatch and I was collateral damage."

SithOrder,f92luuj,t3_e2hpxh,1575036230.0," Thank you sharing, Darth Sazen. The articles are great resources. 

Sometimes it can be hard to differentiate between grief and depression because they share similar symptoms. For me it was difficult to navigate grief and depression at the same time.

I had recently lost a close family member very suddenly, but months prior to that I was having persistent thoughts of self-destruction that had grown increasingly worse over the years. It became difficult to perform normal every day tasks including working/functioning productively at my job. I had sought professional guidance from medical professionals/counselors last November. After 6 months, it was suggested that I visit the psychiatrist and try antidepressants. At first, I wanted to run from the idea of taking a prescription. I skirted around the suggestion and continued to attend counseling. I thought it was a sign of weakness, that it would make me a numb listless person. Eventually, I broke through the wall of fear that was holding me back and tried the medicines.

Some months have passed and now I can do most tasks, focus on creating art, and even take a job certification course. The thoughts of destruction have lessened but remain. I have also been able to grieve at the same time for my deceased family member. Thankfully from the guidance of professionals, much like the guidance of a few of my fellow Sith Order members, I have learned tools to take that energy and become stronger.

I am very thankful for this community and its members."

I am an artist and crafter. I utilize my crafts to strengthen my resolve. Recently, I have gone through some hard struggles due to loss. I have been in an ongoing battle with depression for over 30 years. Taking the emotional energy from darker times/thoughts and turning it into a creative power, helps me make my best art."

I was afraid to tell my mom also because she was emotionally weird and didn't talk about things of personal or emotional nature. So, I never did. Instead she found an email to a friend about it and called me a ""whore.""
