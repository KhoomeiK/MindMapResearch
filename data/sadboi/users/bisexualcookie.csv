Anxiety,fp1gsrl,t3_fzm0k0,1588235024.0,"Yes!! Something I found that helps is tricking my brain into believing I am being productive or actually make the leisure activity productive. For example, I now watch a lot more movies than I used to because I watch high ranked IMDB movies not trashy ones as a way of 'expanding my knowledge and perspective on the world'. Remember productivity is not one dimensional.

Edit: Another example is video games. I love playing Call Of Duty but I feel guilty when I do. I flipped my mindset to see it as a skill to improve upon instead of just a purely recreational activity."

Trading,exhk5s8,t1_exfol1p,1566307265.0,"Thanks for the advice; I've saved up a bit of money to start with but I'm definitely expecting to lose most of it. Not going to get into trading w real money till I'm as confident as I can be paper trading, but you're definitely right in saying that it's a lot different trading w real me as its a lot more likely that your emotions come into play. 

Are there any resources that really helped you when you were getting started? I'd love to know :)

Tysm for your response I'll let you know how I go."

I'm hoping by my last year of high school I could make trading a little side hustle if possible. Any pointers on where I should look so I can dive in and learn all I can about trading? I've been using Investopedia and YT atm."

Trading,exfct0n,t1_exfa6yo,1566237753.0,"thanks for the response! I'm currently quite interested in trading tech and marijuana ETF's so that could be something I look deeper into. However, I'm also curious whether trading forex might be a better idea? I live outside of the U.S so the 24/5 trading hours would be pretty handy but I would need to a lot more research. 

Is there a specific style of trading you think I should look into? day trading wouldn't work for me because I live outside of the U.S (market opens right as I go to sleep) plus I have school! Been interested in swing trading, however, I've heard a lot of negative stuff about it...

How did you start trading?

* More idealistic and spiritual could indicate that you're an intuitive type
* More altruistic... Fe
* Lower absolutism... Ti
* Less pragmatism **could** indicate that you might be an NF type over NT but it's debatable 

Leaves you with E/INFJ

One question, however... 

*  If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?"
