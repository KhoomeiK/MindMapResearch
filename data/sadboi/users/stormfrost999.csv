OH, I wish I was gone, (wah) OH, it's too hard (wah). Did the backbone of your generation disintegrate the moment you were born? Take a look and a take a que from the people of our grandparents and great grandparents generations. They had the spirits and souls that opened up this country and won two world wars. I doubt you pity mongers could figure out how to cross the street without breaking into sobs and almost getting ran over because you couldn't stop texting long enough to check traffic.  You have been given the greatest gift the universe can bestow on any creature - life and free will. If you are do weak not to wake up and realize that you're young and if you can stop feeling sorry for yourself for 5 seconds you can change your life into WHAT YOU want it to be. And NO, It won't be easy - It is NOT supposed to be easy. With Hard Work Come the Rewards. And I have some other BREAKING NEWS you definitely WON'T LIKE - toss those damn smart phones into a drawer or put them on airplane mode most of the day and LIVE YOUR LIFE!!!!! LOOK AT YOURSELF and THOSE AROUND YOU - YOU ARE LIVING A LIFE THAT IS A TOTAL LIE THAT IS BEING DIRECTED BY INFLUENCERS THAT ARE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO AND SAY BY HOLLYWOOD EXECS THAT PAY THEM. No Ariana really doesn't care about you boo-hoo.

You are being completely manipulated. I despise my phone - and yes - wow I'm 37- and only use it when I absolutely HAVE TO. It is a soul stealer and a brilliant invention to take your lack of a strong back bone and turn you into the automatron that they love - they can sell ALL sorts of things to you through their influencers - And I'm not just preaching to the 20 somethings on here. ANY AND ALL of you unless you are on your last days needs to get OFF your soap box and thing about the things you CAN do and WANT TO DO. Start by reaching out and helping people, plenty of people in today's crazy economy would welcome the help. It will make you feel like you belong and will help. Then maybe you will see that all in all - EVERYONE - regardless of how many Sht hands you've been dealt you're still playing at the card table. Make something GOOD happen EVERYDAY! and not just for yourself? See someone that could use a hand - give them that hand? Right how you are all wallowing around in the old pit of self hatred and loathing for no good reason. Hey - you're never going to be an internet 'Influencer' so throw down your idiot Iphone  and look around you. What are YOU good at??? Stop letting media lead you around by the nose. Make some of your own decisions. I actually think all of you twenty somethings could use a nice stint in the Peace Corp to help with an attitude adjustment. BUT you're probabaly too lazy - gotta get off of Mom's couch with free cable, and it may be too hard, I just want to watch TV and play games. WAKE UP> Life WILL pass you pay and you won't have anything to show for it."
depression,forxqjd,t3_g6jgq0,1588020353.0,"This whole shutdown thing has been a total nightmare. I'm sure most of us, like myself, were kind of OK with it for the first few weeks. I tried to keep busy and keep positive. But.... as this has dragged on and I lost TWO contract jobs -I'm in IT I felt the cold grip of anxiety and depression take hold. I actually feel like I'm going crazy most days. I'm very highly functioning technical analyst who pretty much needs to be busy for most of the day to keep my mind focused and settled. I feel like I'm also starting to lose hope. Now - with being out of work for over 2 months my landlord is constantly phoning and texting and wanting us out of the rental house. I'd gladly go - but to where now???? I'ts really hard to plan life, any piece of life, when you don't know what is going to happen and you feel sucked into a string of bad things that just don't ever seem to end. I understand what Trump was trying to do but it went too far and way way too long. When it got to the point that our livelihoods were being destroyed then the American people should have been given a choice--------- Keep working and risk getting sick or stay shuttered. But - Big Brother - must TELL us what to do. Not a true democracy. Sorry to say - but I believe that 80% of the population would have chosen to work and deal with the virus if they caught it. The fatality rate from this is very very low - right around normal flu. So this extreme reaction by the government is a very bad idea and makes me fear that every time a new flu virus comes out we will go into another 'shutdown'. I pray for all of us, for you, me, others that just want to make a living and try to live a decent, happy life."
