Therefore, it implies childishness or lack of refinement when adults over-use it as if they depend on it and can't eat anything without it. Personally, I too like ketchup on certain things cause yeah, it's tasty and definitely compliments certain foods, but I would not want everything I eat to be ketchup flavored and I do find it odd that some people do want all thier food to essentially taste the same, or maybe need all thier food to be sugary."
