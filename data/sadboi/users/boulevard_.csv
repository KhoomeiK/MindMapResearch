GothBoiClique,fpsjad8,t3_gf9kpx,1588874414.0,"An unofficial tracklist has Boyle Heights, Why Did We Ever Meet?, and First Kiss. WDWEM? features Jon Simmons (member of Misery Club and half of the coward. project), so yeah, I think GBC affiliates will feature. I don't think Peep will be on it considering he wasn't on the first one, although I am fairly certain JP will be on it (I talked with him about it on Instagram). 

As for release date, it's been shifted around and no one knows for certain, I don't even think GBC knows. As members have stated before in interviews, it's difficult to get everyone together in one place because even though they are based in Seattle, members don't necessarily live there. Wicca lives in Pennsylvania, Cold Hart in New York, and I'm pretty sure JP lives in Arizona. 

If the album was close to completion and in the mixing stage after everything is recorded, I feel like some hype would've been made by now. Considering that, I don't think it'll be out for maybe even a year or so if you factor in coronavirus. It'll make it harder to record together and be in the studio together as well as take promotional photos / make music videos / other stuff like that. Also, fish has WiLDFiRE to release and considering he is 1/2 of the two producers in GBC (excluding døves, JayYeah, etc.) making it less likely that it'll be released soon. That being said, YIT1 did feature other producers, but still."

ComedyHitmen,fo3dl9x,t1_fo3at8u,1587485079.0,"You have a poor understanding of Korean politics. Unification is not as simple as removing the Kim dynasty. You have to deradicalise the army, the police, the citizens, etc. Obviously many want to escape the DPRK, but many people believe that the DPRK is superior and would be extremely resistant to reunification under a South Korean government.  

On the other hand, the South isn't as willing to unify as you'd think. The inherited DPRK territory would be extremely expensive to assimilate: they'd have to provide welfare, electricity, water, transport, etc. to everyone living in the North, and again, they'd have to be persuaded to obey the South. The South Korean government currently provides defectors from the DPRK with money and housing, but they could not do that for all of the 30m+ North Koreans.  

If Kim does die - and I doubt the sources telling us that he's in a critical situation - then it's likely that his sister would take over because she's been geared towards that, or his child. We don't know for sure that Kim does have a child, but it is likely. Kim children are kept secret because otherwise, they'd become targets.
