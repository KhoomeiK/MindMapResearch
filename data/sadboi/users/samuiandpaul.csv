timferriss,excunhq,t1_exc99py,1566160029.0,"You don't sound arrogant. This all makes sense to me. Have you read eckhart tolle? What he writes about is very similar. The problem is I know all of what you said but can't put it into practice. I have all the tools in my toolbox but am having major trouble using them. I asked for peoples inputs and I for sure am getting defensive. When I first posted this nobody was contributing anything of substance and that frustrated me. There were several people saying stuff that flat out wasn't true about Tim and his depression. I truly don't think I'm jealous of Tim. Maybe I could articulate things better. Maybe my patterns of thought are still faulty. Maybe I've been through too much and a part of me is just gone leaving me incapable of certain things. That doesn't mean I won't try my best and keep grinding because that's all I can do. What was caused by others can only be fixed by  me. In my case I'm searching for some really little basic things in life that are essential to survival that I don't have and are out of my control. I can't control the trauma that was done leading to insomnia. I can't control that I picked the wrong group of friends as a kid and they all turned into addicts so I have no friends since I'm attempting to stay sober for good. Sleep and relationships are key to mental health. I recently realized what I'm missing. I have insomnia, depression, anxiety, PTSD, chronic pain and am still young. Tim is speaking on depression and depression only. I think that's why I have trouble relating to his case and my lack of ability to articulate things well (caused by insomnia) is frustrating myself and causing some anger. This post for sure helped me smooth out my thought process on this. Thanks."
timferriss,exctioq,t1_excetnc,1566159221.0,"That stuff helped me a lot but it didn't cure me. I attribute a good part of where I am today to acid. I suppose I am downplaying his case. Something I realized just now is that I have depression, PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, and have had heart surgery. and am only 26. So I guess I should acknowledge he's talking about depression and none of these other things so I'm comparing apples to oranges."
timferriss,excbsh8,t3_crq73h,1566147010.0,"Here's an updated analysis of this post from me: Tim and many others don't acknowledge the fact that sometimes the only thing that heals is time. To counter my criticism of Tim: maybe he thought to himself ""I have all this success, I'm at Stanford, and I'm still depressed. What the hell is wrong with me?"" and those thoughts making his depression worse. As I stated in replies his case seems to be biological and a chemical imbalance in his brain. Simply an organ not functioning correctly. To anybody that says comparing yourself to others is bad: it can be but not in my case. I'm not jealous of him. I have nothing but love for Tim. It's good to set a benchmark for positive actions ie what did he do that worked? Can I do that? What did he do that didn't work? Does that work for me? I'm not comparing the fact that Tim has a boat load of money and I don't or that he has a best seller book and I don't. I'm not comparing egos. I'm comparing circumstances and resulting actions ONLY after I have examined myself first."
timferriss,exbrm6x,t1_exbksto,1566136839.0,I appreciate the input. Assuming Tim isn't a liar we do know he beat his depression. He hasn't had a major episode for 5 years and has stated it multiple times. His success came from a number of things but he sold fart powder (supplements) in the early 00's and I imagine the profit margin off that was insane. Any uber successful person that's honest will admit luck played a huge part. Tim is smart and not a one hit wonder so I know it's not all luck. His marketing intelligence played a big part too so I wouldn't say his attempt to beat depression made him successful. Thanks for the input.
timferriss,exbr5ju,t1_exaqz0o,1566136609.0,This is for sure the top comment so thanks for actually contributing something of substance. I'm not trying to feel better about myself.

timferriss,exbqqyb,t1_exaf375,1566136400.0,I'll check that podcast out. I agree his success may be an outlet or distraction but it's a good one. I don't see how comparisons aren't legit. I'd like to set a standard to look to and strive to achieve. Not that I'm trying to achieve tims career success' but if I compare myself to him with depression I can further analyze where I'm at to where he was at and what he did to further himself for the better. I'm only doing this after I have made the positive changes in my life. I don't get how people see this is some big comparison contest. This isn't what I'm trying to get out of it.
timferriss,exbpypx,t1_exa89w4,1566135997.0,"I've done LSD over a hundred times, mushrooms countless times (microdosing does well for depression but not comfortable always having shrooms in my house) and DMT more than I can count.

This is an anonymous reddit page I'm not posting a sob story on facebook. I don't care if people know my story or know that I suffered. I agree completely that what matters is what I do after that. I still stand by everything I have said in this post. Being stressed out at stanford is what I'd call a first world problem but I'll be the first one to acknowledge that it's a biochemical problem that anybody can have.

FYI this post isn't coming from someone who is fat, negative, playing a victim, and unwilling to help myself. I'm in killer shape, finances are fine, diet is good.. some things are just out of your control and the only thing that will heal is time. I think people that discuss depression and sorrow should give more emphasis on time being the only healer and that all you can do is try not to self destruct. Sometimes the message should be to not let things get worse and not that they can even get better. Nothing can change the things that happened in my life in the past. Trauma sticks to DNA."
timferriss,exa1tex,t1_exa0u4g,1566097695.0,"Before you commented this I just posted the same thing in a reply about how his case may be biochemical in nature and probably is. And for clarity Tim has openly stated as recently as his last podcast that he hasn't had a major bout of depression for 5 years and he attributes that mostly to psychedelics. I'm assuming that means a shaman and ayahuasca considering I know he's done that and in the same podcast he was speaking very firmly against illegal use (which I'm sure he's done that too). 

&#x200B;

To discuss your third point: I'm not trying to measure struggles here. If I wanted sympathy I'd go to my mom. I'm trying to break down my own thinking and see if I have missed something in my analysis of Tim and how much hope he is giving on this subject to those struggling. I think Tim is awesome and I have nothing but respect for him. I know in text message like this it is hard to get the whole picture of where I'm coming from but I am by no means playing victim or trying to bring him down. 

&#x200B;

Like Joe Rogan I think Tim has a unique ability to combine all the stuff he has learned over the years from his guests. For that reason I think he really does add a ton to these conversations and I like to listen to him too. I'm with ya though, I only listen to episodes with good guests or interesting topics."
timferriss,exa0787,t1_ex9x5oe,1566096992.0,"I listened to his latest podcast and he mentioned he had bad bouts of depression ever since a young age. I can relate more to that and would call that a struggle. Yeah the guy struggled but it's hard to explain where I'm coming from without writing my whole life story and sounding like I'm looking for sympathy. I've been through a lot even compared to people that have been through a lot and that's kind of where I'm getting at. 

&#x200B;

I don't think he's at all being deceptive or overblowing his story. He hasn't spoke much about it from what I know. I'm familiar with the book that went to his parents that made his mom call him and ended up stopping his suicide. 

&#x200B;

I've seen the most hopeless worst shit in the world and being stressed out at Stanford isn't near a struggle compared to someone that is diagnosed with crohn's disease, starts doing heroine, and someone getting murdered as a result. I've seen that happen. Try doing time for a first time non violent drug offense (cannabis) and being in a place where it's so loud you can't sleep much for months at a time and being surrounded by the scum of the earth (that happened to me and that's not in the top 3 worst things in my life). How about the struggle of the native guy in the same prison for an open bottle ticket. I know it's not good to compare to others and you never know someone's own struggles but a good part of people in America (first world country) have it worse at their best than at tims worst rationally speaking. To counter my argument here: depression can be and often is a biochemical problem where the brain isn't functioning correctly so you could take someone in a great life and situation and the brain could literally just not produce serotonin-and I think this is partly the case with Tim. 

&#x200B;

Consider that he didn't beat his depression until he was extremely well off, surrounded by great people, succeeded and everything he tried, and had access to a shaman with ayahuasca. The money thing is important in this because it takes a ton of money to take time off and go to Peru and pay a Shaman to go into a deep session. 

&#x200B;

I still think Tim's the man and he does give me inspiration. His work with MAPS is awesome. Maybe I listen to his podcast too much but it's a little frustrating hearing hours and hours of people with major survivors bias talk about certain things."

timferriss,ex9x984,t1_ex8kk30,1566095747.0,"Not that he doesn't give me hope but 1) it would help me if I could relate to him because he has successfully tackled his depression (5 years since a major episode) and is a great guy. So to me, knowing that someone who has had similar experiences has beat depression (at least for the time being) makes me think that it's possible for me to beat it too. When I then consider the circumstances in which he tackled his depression and the circumstances that led to his depression I think to myself that ""yeah, that's easy for you to say"" and can't relate which fuels the hopelessness that depression can bring. Not that money buys happiness but he beat his depression while being beyond loaded and having a great circle of friends. Correct me if I'm wrong but he also worked with a shaman and ayahuasca, which you have to be pretty wealthy to afford the sessions and take the time to get to the places where it's legal. 2) I never said it did hurt me but it doesn't help me to not relate.--I'm not saying that Tim's not a great guy spreading positivity I'm just saying he's kind of on another level in terms of success and because of that it's tough to relate."
