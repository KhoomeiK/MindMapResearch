While he made a couple good points, he should understand why you’re upset. And if he knew she liked him, he should have known it would not be meaningless for her. That’s terrible. Also why even go there if he thinks she’s annoying?? I imagine how hard it must be for her, too, to have sex with the guy she likes finally and then he starts dating this new chick and she still hangs out with everyone and has to see you two together. HE KNOWS THIS. And of course you would be uncomfortable with this information. I mean how do you feel that he met you and just went to fuck somebody else because he could? I’m sorry. I hope you figure things out. Maybe he’s not terrible and he just fucked up, but I at least hope he understands how you both are feeling. 

Maybe it is a “not throwing away the leftovers” situation but either way it’s trashy. 

Men be having smoll brain energy."
creepyencounters,fm0tb5e,t1_flxafkg,1585665755.0,Is “I am a Killer” on any streaming service?
EatingDisorders,flgibzy,t3_fogdib,1585143292.0,"I’m sorry. I felt a lot of this reading it. I know my parents would say the same kind of thing after I told them. I know for the most part they’re concerned and don’t know how to really communicate that. But now that we’re quarantined my dad keeps mentioning how we all have to eat lighter. And he had a separate conversation with me about “not wasting food.” 

They don’t get it. Maybe they never will. And it hurts. But it IS a good thing you spoke up. You will get better.  Sending love. 💕"
creepyencounters,fkxm22u,t1_fk3tzdt,1584630961.0,Agree. Maybe I’m paranoid but I totally think that dude is a murderer. And what if the knocking on the ceiling was them trying to get OP’s attention asking for help. Either way murderer or not this dude is a freak and you should move ASAP.
creepyencounters,fkxk21m,t3_fgryuv,1584629793.0,I’m a little confused...how old were you at the time? If he was in his mid twenties and only a few years younger than your dad having known him in high school?
LetsNotMeet,fkttmyi,t3_fkgcp6,1584534220.0,How come you said you didn’t know his name and then ended it by referring to him as Brad?
TrueCrime,fj2uiuw,t1_fj2tzl0,1582954448.0,"I would’ve given her the same sentences as the kids. I understand they committed the murder, but they would never have thought to without her manipulation and persuasion. I believe they all got life, but were eligible for parole and are all out now. I don’t think she’d be a danger to society, so I don’t understand why she was sentenced WITHOUT the possibility of parole."
TrueCrime,fj2tmhx,t3_fb7oi8,1582953569.0,"It really is a case of he said, she said. I think she definitely had a big role to play (those tapes, man) but I don’t think she should be in for life."
LetsNotMeet,fgx6mmg,t1_fgqoahy,1581169646.0,"Reading through this, that was my thought too. And maybe that’s why he wants to be around kids-if his mind still works like a child’s."
LetsNotMeet,eq5k850,t3_bwygnd,1559804012.0,"Having my mother raise me watching LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK?? Haha she definitely brings up what to do in certain situations constantly. Especially being a college student, away from home. 
Her and my dad brought up the point of not solely trusting the app description either. Like what if someone stole the car? So you should ask who they are picking up as well. And I thought it was another security blanket concerning fake Ubers! :)"
EatingDisorders,epcozdt,t3_bl58lc,1559156763.0,"I’ve been struggling with my ED since early high school, but it progressed into not only restricting food but purging as well my sophomore year of college. So it’s been about two years of me consistently restricting, purging, and abusing laxatives. I will go through periods of time where I am “fine” and straying away from my habits, but I always hear that voice of never being good enough. Of weighing too much. So I continue to give in to my ED. So I don’t know if I miss it around those times, but it’s almost as if I don’t want to get better. Idk. I’m in therapy but I’ve never gotten official treatment."
