There is a bridge that will for sure do the job and I’m just gonna have one last “fun” night and get fucked up and jump. That plan just makes me more excited than thinking about waking up everyday."
SuicideWatch,fiv6voo,t3_eyjkyc,1582754897.0,"I’m 19 and my parents want me to continue school and if I choose not to then I have to ofc work a shitty job the rest of my life and honestly being dead sounds like a lot more fun than being miserable every day. I can’t stand school or work so that means there is nothing for me in this life  and life doesn’t get better and pretty sure a lot of people can back me up. I’m unattractive, dumb, lazy, and just not good enough for anyone. I have enough pills to do the job so I won’t have to worry anymore about life, that’s how comforting death sounds to me. I don’t care about what others think or that I’m selfish, it’s seriously like being tortured every god damn day and I just can’t do it anymore, I’m done with this life. Hopefully black is all I see on the other side and that’s it."
SuicideWatch,fiv5qoz,t1_fgi4cvz,1582754298.0,"I feel you I’m 19 and can’t stand waking up everyday. It makes me more excited thinking about being dead than thinking about the future. I know I’m going to go nowhere in life and am more useless than dirt. I have enough pills to do it and soon I won’t have to worry about any of this. People who don’t have depression can’t say shit to us, they don’t know what it’s like being miserable and hating yourself for every fucking reason imaginable . It’s not selfish to take your own life it’s doing yourself a favor if it’s truly what you want, therefore to all the people who say it gets better... it really doesn’t once you have this mindset it’s hard to get off of it and death seems the only viable option rn to make me somewhat happy"
