tinnitus,f6oe3dm,t3_do3hay,1573014777.0,I went back to doctor and was diagnosed with sinus infection showing inflammation in my sinuses. But I‚Äôm day 7 of antibiotics and still have pain and pressure and ringing ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I guess I‚Äôm going back again.
mentalhealth,f6oclp5,t3_ds61uh,1573013497.0,Good job. It can be hard to get the motivation for even the littlest things. So we have to claim those victories when we can.
antidepressants,f5jmoa1,t3_do0b44,1572232951.0,"I have the same question. I was just prescribed this for depression, anxiety and back pain. Would love to hear feedback. My mother takes it with no issues but she‚Äôs way older than me and we have different lifestyles obviously. She has depression and pain, but not anxiety like me."
AnxietyDepression,f5jm9hv,t3_dnzjxd,1572232593.0,Same. I will eventually remember but really have to concentrate to get the thought back. I find myself losing my words sometimes or calling my kids by the wrong names too.
PMDD,exs3ziv,t3_cu2bqi,1566531628.0,Your wife is very blessed to have you! This is amazingly thoughtful and so sweet üíï
antidepressants,exguzdf,t3_csm0wq,1566276398.0,Yes. lexapro withdrawal definitely happens in phases. You can google it and there is a timeline. First symptoms are early on and then others can be up to a month or so later.
AnxietyDepression,exgf3tz,t1_exeu35o,1566262441.0,"Check your insurance. I was actually covered for 5 sessions. After that, yes, was around $80 a pop! But the 5 really helped me. The acupuncturist said my tension definitely causes the tightening and constricting of my muscles which causes my pain. I made it 3 months without a follow up visit. And I probably could‚Äôve spread out the 5 further if I didn‚Äôt let it get so bad before I went initially."
AnxietyDepression,exdxmsj,t1_exdvlnp,1566190086.0,Good to know.
AnxietyDepression,exdxicg,t1_exdvk08,1566189966.0,I‚Äôve been doing sublingual as well. Hempworx 500mg. But I‚Äôm only doing like 4-6 drops a day which is basically 2-3 mgs. Maybe I‚Äôm way too low to feel affects? But they say to start low and slow and on the days I try to increase I definitely am way more jittery.  So then I back off again and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm getting anywhere. Maybe I just need to push through.
offmychest,exdsrv0,t3_cs9s1u,1566185613.0,That‚Äôs awesome. Happy for you!
AnxietyDepression,exdspgr,t1_exdrygf,1566185557.0,I‚Äôm wondering it I am too! Or if I‚Äôm just not taking enough. When I add more I think it makes me more anxious. That‚Äôs why curious to hear what others have to say. It‚Äôs definitely ‚Äúon trend‚Äù right now that‚Äôs for sure!
AnxietyDepression,exdnymy,t1_exc4ftw,1566181776.0,Same! Journaling is a great outlet at times like those. Especially the middle of the night.
depression,exdnclp,t3_cs27u9,1566181308.0,"I hate when people say this stuff to me. But if I say it to myself, I see it differently. When a friend of mine lost her son to a horrible disease, I sat back and just sobbed, not only for her, but because I felt so disgusted with myself. I spend so much time wrapped up in my own shit. I feel shitty so much of the time that I obsess over it and feel physically ill over it. I don‚Äôt live my life to the fullest, not by a mile. So seeing something like that happen, I felt like it gave me perspective.  Not that it will change me - I wish it would. I wish I would learn from it and take the perspective and apply it to my life. But in that moment and moments like it, I do believe some people do have it worse."
AnxietyDepression,exdlqzp,t3_cs3w1m,1566180065.0,Best first step is to reach out. There are so many of us that are going through something similar and I think there is peace is just knowing that sometimes. Hang in there and know that you aren‚Äôt alone.
AnxietyDepression,exdkgnd,t1_ex4skf7,1566179076.0,"Advil, Aleve those kinds of things. For my back and ribs, the only thing that really worked for me was acupuncture. They do stuff for anxiety as well. It definitely helped. But I also find when my meds are working well, it makes a difference. Right now, I‚Äôm struggling because the doctor put me on Lexapro and I hated it. So, I tapered it down on my own and I think I need something else. I‚Äôve Been trying cbd oil. That seems to help my pain too, but I haven‚Äôt found it be working much for my anxiety and depression."
AnxietyDepression,ex4s8g6,t3_crfldr,1566010044.0,"Yes...I have had back pain, rib pain, headaches, dizziness, all kinds of stuff. Generally each day can bring something different. It‚Äôs can be so discouraging."
HealthAnxiety,etb3td4,t3_cagcqg,1562636314.0,Acupuncture was the only thing that helped me. It resolved within a few treatments.
HealthAnxiety,etb2wn3,t3_caszlq,1562635645.0,"If you‚Äôre having a lot of anxiety, you could be subconsciously clenching your teeth. That would make your jaw hurt. Try a warm compress and some Advil."
