depressed,fc5xlqf,t3_egdyk3,1577468014.0,"I had a similar sort of opposite problem where depression runs in my family but my parents refused to tell me so that I couldn't get a diagnosis and so that I'd grow up ""normal"". Of course it didn't work, but I also remember when I found out from my gran that it runs on both sides of my family. Please remember depression can be caused by genetics and any corruptive things from someone's past, I've never had medication so I don't know if it works but keeping in communication with your parents is a very good idea - lots of love xx"
