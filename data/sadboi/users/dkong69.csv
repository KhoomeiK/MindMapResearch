Family might put up with this bullshit, but strangers won't. He'll find himself in the hospital or in jail. So not only try to convince your brother for your own sanity but for his son's own good. He sounds like a lil shit that needs discipline.

P.s If I saw/heard someone putting my sister down for her choice of who she dates (she does date women btw) I would harshly come down upon the instigator. It has zero to do with that person who you choose to be with. Your brother should be ashamed of his family and parenting skills."
