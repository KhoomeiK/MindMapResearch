Especially this might be helpful if you want to initialize really big matrices:
```mma
SparseArray[{},{n,n}]	a zero matrix
SparseArray[{i_,i_}->1,{n,n}]	an n*n identity matrix
SparseArray[{i_,j_}\[ThinSpace]/;\[ThinSpace]i\[ThinSpace]>=\[ThinSpace]j->1,{n,n}]	a lower-triangular matrix
```

You could easily make a function like this:
```mma
genm[n_] := SparseArray[{}, {n, n}]
```

If you want to change an element it is easy:
```mma
a = genm[500]
a[[1]][[5]] = 15

Head[a]
SparseArray
```

You can check that it is still a `SparseArray` with `Head[a]` which it is."
