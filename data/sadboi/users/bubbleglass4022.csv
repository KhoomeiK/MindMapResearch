depression,fpfcgke,t3_gcqww5,1588567268.0,"Folks, here's another perspective.  

I'll be 60 next months. I'm kind of a mess. Unemployed, can't seem to find the right job (I should be retired by now! 🤦‍♀️) never had kids, my husband is sweet but his adult son from a  previous marriage won't speak and it's terribly depessing, my kitchen needs redoing and I can't find a contractor, I'm kinda broke, my car sucks and I can't figure out what to do about it, blah blah. 

I had potential but clearly much has been wasted. Because, when I was young, there wasn't much they could do for depression and ADHD.  So I screwed up my degree choice and muddled through a confused career.  

In short, I am kind of a failure by many standards. 

Yet I resolutely keep going to therapy, taking my meds, doing the positive self talk and soldiering on even though I am pissed off that I can't seem to give up.  I walk a couple miles several times a week and do yoga when I can force myself, even though I'd rather sit on the couch and eat. 🤦‍♀️😏

There are so many times I don't particularly care about being alive. Yet other days, the sun is out and I see beauty. I can't prove that things WON'T get better. And so I walk, with my 3 pound weights. I put on my makeup and get dressed and damn it, I am not giving up.

A beautiful, smart friend of mine married a brilliant, gorgeous Wharton MBA. She had two beautiful children who have turned out to be gorgeous, successful corporate titans living the high life. Yet my friend is not here to see them. She was bipolar. She died by suicide some 20 years ago.  

Her death haunts me to this day.  Why?  Why?  She had the fairytale.

But she didn't. I learned back then that there IS no fairytale.

Keep trudging, people. NO ONE gets a perfect life. Those people you think are having so much fun are probably as miserable as you.  They're just too dishonest to admit it. 

That's not to say you should accept mediocrity. It's just to point out that if you feel depressed and crappy, don't give up.  If you have to quit school for a while, if you aren't an instant success (whatever success even IS) .. well, maybe my friend would have been better off if she'd succeeded less early in life. Who knows?

I read SO much smart, thoughtful writing here. Things are depressing and scary right now, but this world has gotten through bad stuff before. And we didn't even have smart phones to help us! 🤪😁  I think things are generally, slowly getting better. But it takes a long time to say for sure. 

Please, get therapy, get medication, heck, consider ECT or TMS treatments even... But don't give up! 

If you have to be a couch potato for a while, that's okay. I was. And I know no one here would tell ME to give up--right??

And if you DO want to tell me to give up, you'd better come ready to explain yourself. I've spent years brainwashing myself to be happy. I'll put up a fight if you tell me now I should give up after all the time and money I've spent. 😉🙁😏

Get help, don't expect perfection of yourself or others, remember that you can't prove things WON'T get better so you may as well stick with the fight to improve yourself and the world, and never, never, never give up. 

That's it! ❤️🌻"

flightattendants,fp6ymf7,t1_folhcvk,1588360878.0,"That's true. I don't have a strong opinion on this. 

However many career fields don't let you stay in a job 20 years with annual bumps and beneficial seniority just because you've done your job. At least the career fields I've been in haven't been like that.  I've been laid off from two corporate marketing type jobs just a couple of months from vesting in a pension plan, after like 4.8 years on the job. 

That said, current flight attendants have enjoyed this scenario for years.  I don't blame any current flight attendant for wanting to keep with the existing set up.  You've put up with the job assuming you'd have some longevity and seniority. It's not an entirely pleasant job, and you've made trade-offs assuming you'd be able to keep your seniority and associated benefits.


I don't blame anyone for feeling kind of cranky right now. I guess that's my point. 😉😏  This uncertainty is stressful.  Very stressful."
flightattendants,fp6whsx,t1_folhhuj,1588359799.0,"Here's another view. 

I'm 59. I have been bounced around in other careers and then out of the workforce caretaking elderly parents for years. I was lucky enough to acrue a little retirement and savings, but not a lot.  I definitely want and need to work again.

I'm in excellent shape and have no children or dependents to worry about, so I researched and decided being a flight attendant would be a great job fit for me. I respect the seniority concept, and would have been happy to be at the bottom of the totem pole. I didn't necessarily need to make a lot of money, but I was excited about earning something and having benefits again for a few years. 

I was well along in the Delta FA process and so excited about doing this as a final career stop.

Bottom line is: we are all individuals. You can't presume that anyone is luckier or not so lucky just because of their age or educational background. 

I can certainly understand why tenured FAs would want to keep working as long as possible. I can also understand the dismay of younger people who are looking to get a toe hold and earn a living. And then there is me, who left the workforce to care for elderly parents in prime earning years, and now wishes to resume her career and wage earning to make up for lost time.  I don't want to be totally broke when I am REALLY old! 

We all have valid points and there are no easy answers. The executives who make really big bucks will decide how this all shakes out.

Love and light to all. Be safe and keep the faith, even though it's difficult to be positive these days for many. Mainly we need to stay alive, or there's nothing to fight for. 🤔😔💐💗"

I'm not an FA, but was quite hopeful about becoming one as I was up for a face to face video interview at Delta. However, they cancelled it, as it cell on the first day of quarantine (or close) and the associated hiring freeze.

I was so excited. This would have been a third career for me. I had researched the pros and cons, and was truly excited about working again after years put of the workforce being caretaker for elderly parents.

I'm having trouble now seeing where my dream ever can become reality, as there's hardly enough work for current FAs to pay the bills. There ISN'T enough for you all, actually.

So as upset as I am, I can only wish all of you out there now love and strength. I have a new respect for those who unfriendly Skies. 

Please stay safe and if it all possible, try to enjoy your time off. I realize that's hard under financial pressure but hopefully most of you at least have health insurance.  If you don't, then I realize it may be impossible to enjoy this time in any way shape or form.

I used to thing men were mean. Now I know women can be just as bad. Too often, they use children as pawns in divorces and good men and the kids, get screwed over. 

It needs to change.  I feel for you. 😢"
DeadBedrooms,fnutmgr,t1_fnt6ky8,1587270762.0,"Yeah. I'm married to a nice man with a very mean ex-wife, for one. I used to think men were all the nasty ones. But when I finally started listening, I saw that women aren't always innocent angels either. It's a two way street."
excatholic,fnustgu,t1_fnta9uo,1587270156.0,I was joking around. No point debating the matter for sure. 😉
DeadBedrooms,fnusp8h,t1_fnsxhfl,1587270068.0,Why are people down voting this? Anyone who doesn't think women can be as mean as men... That's not the world I've seen. People are people. IMHO
DeadBedrooms,fnusezm,t1_fnu2uke,1587269860.0,"Talk to a lawyer. You have to think about yourself since this may likely head to divorce. If not, no harm done. Don't get mad. Get informed."
DeadBedrooms,fnusa3b,t1_fnu5bry,1587269759.0,"It'll be okay. I know that sounds flip but for whatever reason, she wasn't feeling it. 

You're probably much cuter/better than her, and it has nothing to do with you. She just flipped out. 

Try not to hate her. I guarantee you'll find someone better for you. At your age, it shouldn't be too difficult, though it may take a little time. But getting out of a bad marriage should be worth it. Maybe you can be friends and good coparents in the end. That would be great!"
DeadBedrooms,fnurum6,t1_fnu8w4g,1587269448.0,"Sadly, being ""nice"" during a divorce proceeding rarely saves a marriage. Once you're splitting assets, the time for sucking up is generally long gone. The time for sucking up is before anyone files. Sorry you had to see your mom go through that. Civil is one thing and good. Nice?   Not so much."
DeadBedrooms,fnujdlz,t3_g3wqo5,1587263495.0,Give yourself a couple days to process this before you try to do anything. That's all I got for you now.
domesticviolence,fntgnlj,t1_fnr8dq6,1587241268.0,You might end up dying on the streets if you don't call a shelter quick. Be honest with them but tell your abuser nothing. ❤️
