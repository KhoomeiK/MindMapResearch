Schools who make profit off students tuition are really in no better place to say what's qualified as competent. Then a students who gone through the curriculum and sees it's faults.

The value of a degree should increase because the achievement as it is now is broken. I gain nothing by failing them. Society as a whole gains more by having the standards set higher."

If you get a 2.0 in any class I would hardly say youre competent but that you scraped by the minimum because you chose either A not to understand the material or B not do the work required. Doing the minimum in either category doesn't make you competent it makes you a slacker. 

Sure you could raise admission standards however based on what an act? A highschool gpa? Highschool you are still a child someone wanting to pursue a degree later in life shouldn't be held accountable for their mistakes as a kid. it's difficult to raise admission standards then it is degree criteria. As everyone should have the chance to pursue it however it should have a clearer line for if you should. Raising the criteria for your degree let's people attempt it. I'd rather spend 8k for a semester to say hey this isn't for me then waste 4 years in a degree that isn't going to pay itself off. Misleading people that college is necessary at it's current price is predatory. They also do what your saying all the time to people who didn't meet a 2.0.

However I disagree with them saying a lot of science is memorization thats maybe for biology. Chem and physics is largely conceptualization. If you go into these classes thinking you can memorize the material and do well you're gonna have a bad time and not be prepared for the mcat at all. 

To actually do well in stem courses it will take more time and effort than humanities without a doubt. I majored in both so I know a little bit.  Humanities once your proficient enough is largely bullshiting your reasoning to ""that sounds right."" Tailor it to what your professor wants or likes and you got yourself an B or an A. Stem is different there's very little room to bullshit and it's no longer that sounds right its ""that is right"". 

If you go into genchem wanting an A and think you can memorize all the equations. You better memorize 50 different variations and conditions that will change each equation as well. Understanding the material is difficult at first but in the long run way better."

Another thing that isnt smart studying with this subject is reviewing things you shouldn't memorize but understand. Theres a few things you need to memorize for each exam that's every reagent and it's purpose and strange intermediate forms that don't follow the generic ochem arrow flow. The rest of the course you need to try to understand.  

Understanding the flow of electrons is an ochem 1 topic but it's heavily used in ochem 2. This won't go here because steric hinderance, this H leaves first because this is the most stable benzylic position ect. Understanding working synthesis problems by breaking down the end goal in to realistic components you know how to create then mend them together. Its topics like these that help the overall course go a lot smoother.

In the end if you understand the main ideas youre really just looking at flash cards the week before the exam as well doing synthesis problems and whatever else that is perfected with practice.

Shadowing is to show that you know the daily life of a doctor. As someone who's scribed in the ED before nurses exposure to what the doctor does daily is limited. Since your coming from ED experience try to shadow family medicine. Plenty of people have gotten in without shadowing experience it's not a necessity. It is however another thing you can check off and know if you get rejected it wasn't because of X.

Taking the prereqs depends on your Gpa. It would be pointless in my opinion if you had 300 credits at 2.1 gpa. It would take around 8 years of great grades to get up to a 3.0. If you had 2.8 that's another story the prereqs and maybe a couple years post bac would suffice plus a great mcat.

I definitely think I was getting to caught up in some guilt with the idea of ruining someone's life more than anything. It made me hesitant but after reading the most of these comments I feel better. The decision really is not something I should decide rather a board or someone with more experience.
premed,fi46010,t3_f67iuw,1582134661.0,"Talk to the dean of students if the department chair ignores it. Ask the people with similar answers for pictures of their exams. Bring up your case and tell them what you overheard, say you are feeling singled out and that the grading is bias. If they ignore you then keep collecting evidence and maybe consult a lawyer to see if you have anything. Back up plan should be to drop the course at the deadline of being able to receive a W if the professor stays a cunt."
premed,fi4573t,t3_f6837b,1582134204.0,"You could look into beta blockers. Or you could try exercising a lot the week before/ during your exam. Exams are stressful sure but it's nothing you have not done before.  If you fail and your class is nice you have a drop. If you fail twice aim for a B or C 1 or 5 C's won't prevent you from getting in medschool. If you're gpas hurting take a w. There's always a logical back up route that ensures that small exam you just took is not the end of the world, even in a ""high stress premed mindset"""
premed,fhfc3ft,t3_f2hsnh,1581540411.0,Mushishi. 10/10 would watch again. It's very melancholic and a relaxing pace that it's nice to watch and destress with.
premed,ff8morm,t1_ff8grn0,1579686183.0,I'm pretty sure that's poop and not a vein. She's flexing her decompacting skills on you lol.
premed,ff42rkv,t3_er5g5a,1579554281.0,Usually it's 5-10 years from graduation. Not from when the class was taken.
premed,ff3y9pq,t3_eriszq,1579551483.0,"Code it how you want it. Can be a stem or non stem however at the end of the day amcas will correct it to where it should be, so no guarantees."
premed,fdz5mvl,t1_fdxfzh8,1578786954.0,"Acid chem review pH/ pka when is it protonated/deprotonated. Enzymes and Gibbs free energy graphs, amino acid names of at least the common 20, CAC and glycolysis. That should get you through the first 2 exams easily."
premed,fdpeoui,t1_fdpd926,1578626701.0,"If there's no real reason you need to take it then don't take it. Take this as a lesson and move on. It's only going to get averaged out and you can likely explain it as it was a dumb freshman mistake.

 "" I had thought it was dropped and I did not verify with my teacher""

"" I missed my final as I did not see it was at a different time than the scheduled class""

Etc...

Just know you can't really afford anymore slip ups."
premed,fdpcrds,t3_emhucg,1578625353.0,"Do you need the course? If you need it for your major or something retake. If it's just an elective there's no real reason to re take it, although it might be alot easier the second time around."
premed,fdpcc0i,t3_emjfo4,1578625060.0,Gen.lib.rus.es usually has all the books I need check here it might have yours or others classes
premed,fdpblu2,t3_emkiku,1578624560.0,What?
premed,fdlhz4o,t3_elzrbk,1578524425.0,It's not ideal but as long as you maintain competitive grades at your 4 year you should be okay. Note tho that some schools will see your prereqs as less rigorous and it can put you at a disadvantage. Do well on the mcat to show academic competence and that you would have done well regardless of cc or a university.
premed,fdlhdn3,t3_em05b4,1578524056.0,When I used the book the new version was 55 while the old one was 30. Older one worked just fine for me. There's also probably a PDF of the new one or old ones online somewhere if you look hard enough.
