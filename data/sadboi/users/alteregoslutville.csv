Petioles,fq635lb,t3_gh22c5,1589123525.0,"The only CBD I ever used for that kind of help was Flow Kana CBD cannabis. It really did help chill me out. But I wasn’t actually ready to quit. When I was ready to stop I went cold turkey. It’s really fucking hard the first 5 days. I also took Gabapentin for the body pain. That’s the only thing that helped honestly. Also, get protein drinks so you can still have calories in your body. That’s the biggest thing I think. I know you won’t want to eat but your body needs it."
Petioles,fq62kyo,t3_gh05kc,1589123182.0,"This is part of my battle with smoking daily and only smoking on my days off. When my tolerance is low I can not smoke around other people. I straight up trip. Although I like the feeling, it’s very intense and I can’t handle being around anyone I’m not 100% comfortable with. If I smoke daily I can actually hangout with people and not over think and get super weird. 

The weed now a days is super potent. I also don’t like indoor as much as outdoor. Indoor feels  more like a pill high to me. When I smoke outdoor it’s the euphoria feeling. It’s really cool and strange how you can notice these things once you’ve stopped for a while. Cannabis really does help me though. I’ve been able to gain three pounds so far. But I can not control my munchies."
BPD,fq5x73u,t1_fq55ant,1589119751.0,This is how I react too. I can only watch Disney movies once. They ALWAYS make me cry. When someone does something kind for me I never truly understand the WHY. Why me? Am I really worth that? Were you really thinking about me? It’s just so nice I end up running away because I can’t handle the emotions. It’s actually kinda embarrassing. Especially when it happens at work.

If someone can’t understand that, they aren’t for you. 

I’m pretty sure he is waiting for me to “get healthy” and then thinks we will get back together. Not gonna happen. If you left me when I needed you the most, what’s gonna happen when something in the future happens? Like a death? Or literally anything ? He won’t be there. He sure the fuck isn’t going to get me when I’m “healed” I’m going to heal my self and love myself."

The week was really hard because I was a heavy user. But after day 6 I was fine. Now I only smoke on my day off, and it’s only at night when everyone around me is asleep lol. It’s helped a lot. I get the munchies again, yoga is even better and I’m not stressing on where and when I’m gonna get weed again. It feels good. It’s easier to keep boundaries too."

Anyways, when I smoked again on day 7, to the fucking minute , I barely got high. So that made me not smoke for another three days, and that’s when it hella hit. But I also bought my God strain. Cherry pie always fucks me up. I’ve been literally eating pounds of food. Everything is good. My mind set is better too though. So maybe this all plays a part, I really haven’t thought this far on it before. Until now."
Petioles,fpu97rd,t3_gfjzqb,1588907440.0,"I tried shrooms about two months ago and that’s exactly how it felt for me as well. It was pure euphoria. I had actual peace in my mind and soul. I like it better than cannabis. I never thought I’d say that about anything. 


But long story short, I took a T break for a week and now I only smoke once or twice a week. At least for now. I actually trip like I used to in high school and I have the munchies again. I haven’t had those in ten years. Food is amazing again. So maybe try smoking only 4 hours before bed. Or whatever works for you"

Then when I actually start my period I can literally feel the emotions disappear and life is good again. I’ve ruined so many relationships during those time because I truly thought the world was out to get me and everyone thought I was a piece of shit. Turns out it was my hormones.

I’ve learned the hard way that you have to accept that some people won’t care or react the same way you would. I personally could never just ignore someone if they wrote that to me. If someone I hated called me right now and said they needed me, I’d say “give me your address I’m on my way” but that’s the type of person I AM. Other people aren’t. And it hurts and it makes me angry, and even THAT is OKAY. What’s not okay is then beating yourself up and thinking you’re a shit person. You’re NOT bad.

Either the people did what happened to you, my first time going. Same thing. The guy said there must be nothing wrong since “seen to know what the problem is” like, mother fucker. I wouldn’t be here if I knew what was wrong. That was 10 years ago. Then I got locked up on a 5150. Got diagnosed bipolar. But no follow up from anyone. I saw the doctor there for maybe 10 minutes. He was nice, but still no real solutions. Another 6 years went by, I ended up taking a bpd therapy class as well as anger management. Those actually helped. They teach you what your triggers are and how you can cope easier. And they didn’t make me feel like I was just a crazy person. 

Do Not give up on yourself. You are the person who benefits the most from this. I know that first call was shitty , but keep trying until you find the right people. I had to go through my doctor. She found a lot of resources for me."

And why was the last trash aesthetic ?"
ActualPublicFreakouts,fjw4kbg,t1_fjvojcj,1583634894.0,He smacked/ punched him. The guy hates the security because he “stole his Uber money”. So he pretends to say sorry then hits him.
BPD,fjuc22m,t1_fjtyu9v,1583615459.0,"It’s gonna hurt like hell, but I swear, time really does help. It gets easier. And hey, if you end up going back a few times, don’t beat yourself up. It’s hard to just stop loving/ liking someone."
BPD,fjsoe2h,t3_feweyr,1583599131.0,"If you want to go through a lot of mental pain, keep him in your life. But the healthiest thing you can do for YOU, is cut contact. 

He said he loves someone else more, then both of you kind of had sex, he stops it, then says marry him, THEN tells you he was thinking of the other girl? I understand the obsessive thinking but this guy is super mean. That’s literally just mean to do to anyone. 

I also get you both were drinking but honestly if you want to be happy, you gotta block and delete him from your life. You can’t stay friends. It’s not gonna work. You both have too many feelings for each other. I hope you both find what you’re looking for. Relationships are so hard. It’s never black and white."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fj6l98w,t1_fj6kus9,1583074764.0,"I just ended a relationship like that. He was seriously so kind to me in the first month and a half. That’s what got me. Then when I finally let him in after three months, it’s like a switch went off. Not the same person anymore. It’s so bizarre. Total mind fuck that I’m not dealing with. Took a whole month and this sub to realize what the fuck I got myself into."

weed,fix9ch1,t3_fad3y2,1582815690.0,What brand is it? And if it’s from a legal dispensary there should be some long ass numbers you can type into their website and see the exact testing. Lots of companies like to be transparent.

Instagramreality,fix8u6b,t3_fad686,1582815358.0,"My new iPhone take pictures that look like they are already filtered. It’s actually kinda upsetting. I got it about a week ago. I purposely don’t FaceTune or edit my photos with filters because , well, fuck that. This is me. But since I got this new phone, all I gotta do is be in a semi lit area and my photos come out flawless. It’s insane how good technology is now. Because I sure as hell know I ain’t that dope looking, but my phone can take some rad pictures"
Petioles,fitwaxt,t3_f9uio6,1582730762.0,I’ve been in this nasty rut of waking up at 3-4am and smoking until 8-9am. I feel so burnt out. I need a fuckin t break so badly. But I just don’t have motivation this week.

It feels good , idk how long it will last, but I’m trying to enjoy it and not wait for the next crisis lol. It’s a good day!"
BPD,fiersvn,t1_fier8ha,1582381915.0,"How do I not get mad that I can put up with other people being exhausting but they can’t with me? I get people have limits, but I can’t let go of that anger. 

Idk. Just something  I’ve been thinking about. I’m trying really hard to accept the good and bad about myself and I’m at the point where I like who I am, genuinely. But it’s so frustrating when people can hurt me but I have to be the best me. Or they leave. Do I cut them how? I hate feeling this way. Hella rant lol. Sorry"
