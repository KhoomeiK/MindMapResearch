CBD,fq6egfa,t1_fq6dotj,1589129942.0,That's great to hear! I'm definitely going to check it out then and give it a shot.
CBD,fq6apwl,t1_fq69b4p,1589127886.0,I've done both. I don't like the taste either though. Do they have them available with flavor to them? Or is it suggested to add it to a beverage instead?
CBD,fq67xmw,t1_fq65l9b,1589126302.0,"Those are options I've tried, and I do use gummies but only for sleeping. I get them from my current doctor and they knock me out. I have a CBD cream for pain, but it's only for surface pain or muscle issues. And I've tried the tinctures but they nake me nauseous and give me stomach upset. 

In all honesty, my lungs have been improving thanks to my profession and changing my location. It's gotten much better as time has passed. But due to the current situation the world is in, it's slowed down my progress on check ups and seeing specialists to get those things evaluated, so I don't have a full idea of how sensitive or damaged my lungs are from recurrent and chronic illnesses or what other issues I'm up against. 

Vaping and smoking hasn't bothered me since I don't do it often and tend to limit myself, but it has helped in many aspects of my mental and physical health especially when doctors aren't helping. Because of shitty doctors and wanting to find what works best for me, CBD seemed like another beneficial option. There's just so many ways to consume it and I'm trying to find what will work during the day to help alleviate my pain and anxiety/depression."

What really worked well to help me heal and balance the bacteria and yeast down there was a bath concoction I made, perfected, and continue to use. I put apple cider vinegar, baking soda, and an Aveeno baby oatmeal bath packet all into the tub and soak for at minimum 15 minutes. At first it'll sting because, well, vinegar, but over time your body will adjust. And you can use it when you're not having symptoms to help balance you without being overwhelming. AND it's a more natural remedy than most! Give it a shot and see if it works for you.

Oh! Also I used coconut oil down there after I was done bathing and, if I felt chafed or in pain, a little A&D ointment with the open cuts/fissures/split skin."

Unfortunately, she's using you or feeling she's entitled to what you have. This will lead to more problems between you two if communication isn't made clear.

medical_advice,fnpivsr,t1_fnpe69d,1587146277.0,"Thank you for your advice. Let me give some background to what I mean by the serious implications of me taking antibiotics for most of my life and most of my illnesses that I've encountered.

Just over the past 2-3 years I've gotten what doctors have told me ""severely and chronically sick."" They contributed it to the change in my environment since I moved from a four-season area that gave me chronic bronchitis two or so times a year as well as caused recurrent asthma issues along the way. The fact that I would get sick so often would cause me to be on medicine more often then not. Moving to a warmer climate has made my body react differently to the pollen and plants. This resulted in me having severe tonsillitis (could not breathe nor swallow my own spit by the time it became obvious that it was more than a sore throat). This happened four times in the span of 5 or so months within the first year I was settling into my new hom. I was constantly on antibiotics that caused more constipation issues on top of what I had problems with, so I was going to the bathroom maybe 2 times in a week if I was lucky. The yeast infections were eventually under control once a certain antibiotic was found to be the culprit, but it still is a delicate balance to keep hold of and does get thrown off when I take a lot of antibiotics at once or over a long period of time. Ever since I moved and started getting sick, given the recommendation of probiotics, I took them religiously. This only helps ease a bit of the complications of not only being ill but having medicine to take constantly, but it takes a while for my body to rebalance itself. I have not stopped taking probiotics but have upped my intake and changed my diet as well as added a bit of exercise. It has helped my health but every time I face antibiotics, it wreaks havoc on my body. Maybe it's due to taking so much over my short life, but all I can say is it's been overdone. This is also leaving out the years of fighting UTIs with multitudes of antibiotics, but this is why I'm wary to take them at all especially in large amounts. 

In all honesty, I do believe that my tooth is an issue, but so was affording it at the time. Now that I have insurance, I want to get this fixed and taken care of. I haven't disregarded the severity of the situation, but it also wasn't forced as a severe issue by doctors either. Of course, you can only do what you can, and I believe that's the mentality my latest dentist took with this medical issue. I just fear the negative impact antibiotics have put on my body over the past 17+ years of consistent use, especially with the way my body reacts to a lot of them now. I'm lucky it's only certain ones, and I usually don't question what doctors give me but hope for the best, but I've become warier of what I'm taking considering I've been shoved medicine most of my life. I want this fixed and I'd rather just go in and get the tooth taken care of rather than wait to see if it subsides, considering this is what the doctor is suggesting. 

Again, thank your for your advice. Hopefully this gives more clarity and understanding with the information above."

He was there and still there to support me and help me through those battles. Before him, my relationships would deteriorate due to conflicts, fights, large indifferences. We've all gone through the pain of just not getting along with someone and it falling apart, but I chose people I wanted to help and it tore me down until I couldn't take it, which took longer each time I jumped into those situations. I've been brought down, belittled, abandoned, broken, and even beaten (punched right in the crotch). It kept feeding that idea that I was meant to be alone and that love was always supposed to hurt. I can't understand your painful shoes since I've never been through a relationship with cheating, but I know it makes you feel less. I'm sorry you've gone through all that pain.

The team jumped in during Spring Break to get started and figure out how everyone was going to get their lessons and resources out there as well as whether they wanted to use the system they already had in place. Eventually, they came around to it. Usually, we are all communicating and collaborating in school, but I know there are always downfalls and flaws in groups. I just didn't realize that the administrative team would take over and we would be just following their orders. Part of me wants to believe that it was teacher input that made the changes in the past few weeks, but I'm pretty sure it was more parent input than anything else and what we're doing is trying to make it work with what we have.

I've tried reaching out to teachers in my team but I don't get much of a response. It seems communication has broken down, though I can't blame anyone when we've all been stressed trying to figure out how to make what we do in class work for every family's situation at home. Overall, I did find out from another teacher that they didn't have issues like I am going through. 

As well, I've spoken to IT and they've been helping me through every step and every issue. It still isn't being resolved, not so much because I'm not getting answers but that everything we've tried so far seems to either do nothing or halfway fix it.

AmItheAsshole,fabfrk3,t3_e887ea,1575922552.0,"Let me give some perspective and then my vote on this.

No one likes change, so I get your thought process on why you don't like her hair short. HOWEVER, it's her choice in the end. You're opinion matters enough for her to ask but it doesn't mean that's the decision. Accept and just remember it grows back. It's just hair. 

I, though, understand the opinion of a trusted friend/family member/significant other can be helpful in making a final decision on something. Changing your hairstyle is a big one. Maybe she doesn't look great but wants to try it out. That was my experience. My husband looked back at my hairstyle and told me to never do that again. I think it was cute but didn't fit for long since the growth made it look ugly as can be. 

NEED MORE INFO but YTA if you can't accept and just deal with something temporary."

trichotillomania,faammvi,t1_faa2jd1,1575910792.0,"I'd say practice. And try stencils. Give yourself time to try out different colors, styles, and techniques."
trichotillomania,faaho3u,t3_e88ils,1575908945.0,I used to feel that way too. I had pulled my eyebrows so vigorously that I lost them years back. I started ~17 years ago and had watched them decrease their growth 5-7 years into it. Then they just never grew in. I get a few dark hairs sporadically popping out around or on my eyebrow line but it's nothing that makes up any portion of an eyebrow. I used to be tired of putting make up on and finding the right make up tools and tricks. But now I'm not so self-conscious and I see it as a talent. I have looked back and I used to miss my eyebrows as a kid (mind you I had a full on unibrow). But I'm happier now that I've accepted my look.
AmItheAsshole,f9xzaxi,t3_e6tzwu,1575720857.0,"First off, everyone's way of dealing with hospital visits is different. So I can understand it being a norm to have someone there all the time, have visits during specified hours, and just not going at all. Everyone's different and you and your wife just have different mentalities and experiences with it.

Second off, everyone's opinion on staying overnight is different as well. Since your wife didn't communicate that she wanted you to stay, you leaving isn't terrible. Her communicating to you years later is a problem and harboring old emotions. She should've spoke up. HOWEVER, you should have asked to play it safe. Now hindsight is 20/20 in this situation. It's too late to fix it but now you have to set clear and compromised expectations on what to do next time either one of you are in the hospital and that you must COMMUNICATE what you want.

You're not a bad father or husband. You're not a bad person. You both just didn't communicate. 

So..... ESH."
trichotillomania,f9xp4iu,t3_e6mt9o,1575715706.0,Ice if it's a bruise or simple bump. Heat if it's an enflamed hair bump. You'll know the difference if it becomes red and enflamed.
trichotillomania,f9xoqdu,t3_e7cvzt,1575715466.0,"You're not alone. Don't quit, but get help. Go to a counselor. It may be different where you're from but if it's similar you're university should have a counselor on site to help. 

I've had trichotillomania for 17 years. I started at 10 years old and it was noticeable that my hair was gone on my face. Don't let others bother you. Just keep going and try your best. Drink tea to help you sleep. Take a day off from uni and work to take care of yourself if you can. Don't give up."
MusicEd,f9k0ask,t1_f9hm8s3,1575389966.0,I actually spoke to easysonglicensing.com. They're a third party group and it costs to use their services and then you have to pay the companies they contact on top of that. It's the school paying so I'm trying to be economical and quick about this.
MusicEd,f9jzuvq,t1_f9hkjks,1575389680.0,"I re-read your comment. We paid in advance and the cost of the ticket is supposed to make the money back spent on reserving and using the venue.

But I read your last paragraph. I'm unsure and worried. Tbh I'm getting different responses in the school. And I'm having trouble finding the companies for the songs."
Marriage,f9hfvjp,t3_e52oie,1575314458.0,"I just went through this kind of situation just before Thanksgiving. It was the biggest eye opener and made me realize how lucky I am to have a husband who wants to spend the rest of his life with me. I hope that I can get to that 25-year mark and look back. The biggest regret was fighting and running off, thinking that being together was a mistake. I'll never forget, but at least we can forgive."
MusicEd,f9hebnt,t1_f9hbbj7,1575313717.0,I know we'll have to double check but THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MusicEd,f9hajnf,t1_f9ha0bc,1575311886.0,Oh! However the other music teacher is paying out of his pocket to have musicians support him as he is accompanying the chorus groups. I wanted this to factor into the situation as well.
MusicEd,f9haegw,t1_f9h9smm,1575311813.0,"Well we are performing at a local theater. Ae are charging admission but it goes back to the school and in a way makes up for the money we paid to use the venue. We are a private school so we fundraise and charge for things to bring money back into our programs and expansions.

Would this affect this ciecumstance?

Thank you!!!"
Marriage,f8wepvj,t1_f8w9er6,1574889133.0,I spoke to him in one discussion that I didn't feel important to him. He felt bad and consoled me which made me think things were changing. Then in the second discussion I expressed how I didn't feel supported and I was hurt by him not trusting me. This got blown back at me and he wasn't happy hearing it. I don't know. It was like seeing two different sides of him. Though both arguments were about how he went to help his mom and spent so much time there that our plans were pushed aside and never happened. I dunno. I'm so confused.
Marriage,f8vzoou,t1_f8vxf4s,1574880449.0,"Then I guess I've gotta ask myself what I'm doing in this relationship?

We weren't always like this and that's why it's so painful to think of it ending. I know things weren't always bad. And I know with help we could do better."
Marriage,f8vvaha,t1_f8vtxsn,1574877960.0,I've been trying in my own way to change until I can see a therapist. But we aren't on the same page about getting help. He believes you take care of it yourself.
Marriage,f8vv60h,t1_f8vtui1,1574877891.0,"Man I wish someone could talk sense into him but he believes his mom over anybody, even me.

And he is not."
Vent,f8vtcn8,t1_f8vs4gh,1574876875.0,"It's hard because so many times we're contradicted by our own minds. I've been taught a lot of my wants, needs, mindsets, and mental illnesses are wrong. Now I'm still fighting all of this and I'm slowly learning what's healthy for me and those around me.

Go to those you trust, reach out on here (and that's what I've been doing and it's given me more perspective and clarity and help), and write down what you want and need. Write/video record/audio record/blog/speak and vent. It helps. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via message. We can maybe help each other."
Marriage,f8vt0vi,t1_f8vrcu8,1574876691.0,"I don't plan to ever have children, so this makes things less complicated.

And I guess we'd have to compromise on making change together to make it work or else it will fail. I just hate the fact I thought this mentality and way of living would change because he said it would. Though he said it out of frustration because his mother upset and hurt him as she was moving out and living her own life, I thought he meant it. Maybe I was being naive."
Marriage,f8vsrfa,t1_f8vmmfd,1574876545.0,"He said he wanted to marry me and have me in his life the first moment he met me. We are in love and do love each other, but it seems we have a lot of separate growing to do. Plus the way our relationship started and progressed wasn't exactly the best way to have us grow and get to know each other.

I told him that I feel he doesn't support my want for medical help and this was during an argument, so he took it as me saying he doesn't support me at all. This was very recent but it all stemmed from a larger situation and pains I can't move on from.

Though I've been told it's the correct thing, he doesn't see it that way and finds my arguing and talking just trying to separate and hurt his relationship with his mother."
relationship_advice,f8vs9q7,t1_f8vm65k,1574876272.0,"I'm so sorry for the pain you went through. My family life wasn't so good either. They did divorce and it led to a restraining order and them living states apart. They're happier in their own ways but the damage over time is still affecting me to this day. 

I moved about 2 years ago from one state to another. I basically started over and haven't made any lasting friendships. I have my friends from my previous state and high school and such that I've been reconnecting and keeping in touch with. That's about it though."
Vent,f8vo0ye,t3_e2hqlr,1574873729.0,"You are not alone. I'm married and now I see the things I didn't want that I signed into. You always have a choice, and this is coming from those who I spoke to and received advice from."
relationship_advice,f8vltdj,t1_f8vlhsm,1574872338.0,"Thank you so much for giving me so much advice, information, and perspective. I've been struggling but over the posts I've backed off saying anything bad because I honestly only know parts of the problems and my own problems. It's hard and I'm hurting and I'm waiting for help. I don't know what else to do and I'm contemplating being fine with the way the family I've joined functions, but I don't know. My husband doesn't believe in divorce or separating at all, but I'm scared it's heading that way."
Marriage,f8vjey8,t1_f8vgmnc,1574870799.0,"Apparently asking that is wrong and he's very hurt by it. I'm afraid this will split us up.

Unfortunately I'm only part time and my biggest source of income out of the two jobs I have doesn't offer health insurance for part timers. I signed up to be on his insurance but that won't start until January. I screwed up getting it taken care of the first time and that was held over my head in our last argument. So now I just have to wait.

Well he used to take care of her. And I know that her terminal illness was the cause of her health decline and inability to physically and financially take care of herself, but she moved out with her husband so she's self-sufficient enough to be on her own now. I know they want his help with heavy lifting and hard work because he's good at it. I just get frustrated when it takes up so much time when I stay separate from helping them since I can't do much in most of those situations, I usually have my work to do, and I just feel awkward as hell when things are jumbled between us all."
Marriage,f8vej4b,t1_f8ve7hv,1574867524.0,Well I did the letter just last night and it all blew up in my face. We ended up arguing and he took a lot of what I said wrong. Do I need to try something else? Or is this a bad sign?
Marriage,f8vdvlk,t1_f8vdd1m,1574867051.0,I've tried giving myself a day to think it over and expressing to him I need space and time so I can talk to him calmly. I've also written a letter. I've reached out to friends. Do these count?
Marriage,f8vc2jb,t1_f8vau48,1574865717.0,He disagrees with it. He got help years back but did what was required (since he was in the service) and then just stopped after that. He hated how the meds made him feel and he made a realization that he could do this on his own.
