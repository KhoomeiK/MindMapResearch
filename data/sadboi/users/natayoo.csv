My dad literally told me that everything is fine now and that I am dumb because Sweden didn't go on lockdown and they are doing great and developed herd immunity. Which is bullshit because first of all more than 18.000 got infected in Sweden and over 2.000 of them died and nobody knows if you are actually immune after catching the virus and for herd immunity to work at least 60% of the population would need to be immune. But what do I know I am just dumb.

I am aware of the fact that the economy is about to die. But what's more important, companies or lifes? Cause if we get hit by a second wave as bad as the spanish influenza the economy will get hit even worse cause there won't be any people alive to keep it going. We don't know enough about this virus to say we are save and all is good now but that's exactly what most people think. Because we get informed every single day that they found out something new we just think we know a lot about this virus but that's just not true. We basically know nothing. We are not sure how long it actually survives in the air or on surfaces, we don't know if you can get reinfected, the virus is mutating constantly.

And people like my dad or my grandma who think we are save cause shops and restaurants open up again will be our downfall.

My dad's biggest argument was ""you are not always right"" and I told him that never in my entire life have I wished to not be right. But I'd rather look back and laugh about me being too cautious than looking back knowing that I was part of the reason why millions of people died."

tumblr,fox85yb,t1_fox79m5,1588136485.0,"In Austria the system is a bit different than in the US because we are one of the countries with free healthcare. When you call an ambulance usually only paramedics show up (depending on what you say on the phone) they are not doctors so they can't tell you that you are 100% fine. They are more like nurses on the go. When it's a bad case they will order a doctor to come and if it's really bad the helicopter.
And because it is free (the helicopter is a bit tricky cause it's part of some insurances but not all) calling it without needing one is against the law and then you have to pay for it.

I think that's why they have to take you with them cause a doctor needs to clear you. I am not sure tho. Maybe someone knows more about it.

It's probably a ""either come with us or pay up"" type of situation.

When someone dies alone in their flat first the paramedics with a doctor show up and then police and fire brigade cause the fire brigade isn't allowed to open a door without the police and if it's not really necessary the police won't open the door.
