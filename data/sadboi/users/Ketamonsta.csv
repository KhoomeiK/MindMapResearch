EDAnonymous,fqwn2nf,t1_fquj1e6,1589710582.0,It's silly. Yet we subscribe to it everyday at the expense of how everybody else perceives us except how we perceive ourselves. Social media is clever marketing... all it does is tap in to those insecurities to get you to buy things. The design of it is to keep you miserable so you keep consuming. All of these services are free because they come at the price of your mental health. A price that everybody is willing to pay because its free
EDAnonymous,fquf77t,t3_gko1x5,1589657854.0,"I feel like its some hardcore wiring as a female to be overly competitive and self-conscious about appearances. I don’t subscribe to the whole impossible Instagram standard of beauty and lies because I know those people are just as (if not more) insecure than people like us who feel its sting. Nobody is immune from self-criticism. Everybody is odd in some way shape or form. But yes, I’d be lying if I said I was entirely above the compare and despair train. It’s mostly in-person. When passing someone gorgeous on the street or at a festival. I’m a huge festival-goer so you can imagine it’s like instagram come to life and eating your heart out in-person. 

Some days are okay because I get dirty looks from girls every now and then who obviously want something of mine that they lack. It’s just pulling the ranty/obsessive mind away long enough to tell it that it’s not cool to talk you down in to nothingness. There’s a severe amount of awareness for what we lack rather than what we have going round this life"

You need to have a very strong grasp on who you are and how to balance productivity when getting blazed. Weed is a very difficult habit to kick because its almost second nature to want to give up on things before trying (for most people). Don't be too hard on yourself if you relapse.

Personally I haven't had any issues in quality. Sources are charging a minimum spend due to the risk of trafficking in these times, though. It's interesting that dealers are still willing to put their ass on the line in this heightened state of policing.

EUGENIACOONEY,fmxki63,t3_fxb7fs,1586466695.0,"Deflecting responsibility sums it up well. Although with her case in particular (Eugenia) I don't feel like it was gaslighting, at all. I just think its a very simple case of being too kind to be truly assertive. She puts others needs first way too much, and in return, she doesn't feel as though she can do this for herself. This is why she uses air quotations a lot and constantly apologizes even though she's trying to get her point across. This is the real issue, the disordered behavior is just a by-product or 'symptom' of this lack of self-worth. 

As a Youtuber (or influencer) you constantly have to be aware of how what you say and do is going to affect your viewers. Any little thing can be taken out of context by the person viewing the video, whereas the entertainer is just doing their job and trying to not piss people off. We, the viewers, get the satisfaction of hiding behind screens and saying vile things and making up problems/stories about said person who puts their ass on the line for us. She needs to acknowledge that she can't please everyone, and just be more assertive and confident about that. She's too fragile for this industry, and will dishearteningly always struggle to grow as a person if she doesn't adapt to find her self-worth outside of the youtube realm."

EDAnonymous,fmxhr9o,t3_fxxk5u,1586465222.0,"You're not a bad person, you are suffering. We tend to measure our self-worth with things that destroy us, which shows just how unhealthy our relationship with our sense of worthiness to ourselves really is. Inadvertently, it usually is the case of measuring our self-worth at an even grander and more impossible scale -- how we wish others to see us. But ultimately we cannot control others thoughts/feelings/actions toward us, we can only do the generous act of sparing ourselves the trouble by being kinder to ourselves. Once substances enter the equation, you're risking that low sense of self-worth with a chemically altered mindset. The low will feel twice as low, thus the cycle repeats itself. I think once we acknowledge that we are enough, it gets easier to eliminate problems one by one, such as substance abuse. From there, you can re-asses if the people we are trying to impress are worth our presence, and the fucked up thing about ED's is that we have convinced ourselves that being comfortable in our own skin is all for us, no-one else."

Anything in abundance isn't good for you, it's common sense that moderation is key with anything in life. While decriminalizing drugs may take away the taboo element of it making it less appealing (because lets face it, humans are pathetic in nature when it comes to going against odds), it doesn't take away the fact that they speed up chemical reactions in the brain which can flip that addictive tendency. 

I agree with some of what you're saying, but at the end of the day, one will always argue for what one believes in and will find flaws in anything that goes against that bias.

Last years set up was ridiculous in size -- micro-venues became the size of stages, and there was way too much space within the town and not enough for the campsites. I think because it has such a multitude of genres they feel it has to cater to a wider audience. This is where the whole capitalism, ""more is better, bigger is better"" comes in to play and then the concept of a festival is lost. Primarily, festivals are gatherings of close-knit communities celebrating one thing. Boomtown's unique in the sense that it unites people from all walks of life, but unfortunately the stance of being an independent festival means that funding is an issue. I am also selfish in saying that I'd much prefer a smaller Boomtown as someone whose been going for years now. But ultimately this has to happen. It will mean less load on workers, and an easier crack-down on safety and smaller queues etc. for all. They can incorporate this in to the stories script for coming years, and since they are already going with the eco-friendly vibe, this should be a huge reality check on the carbon footprint placed even on an annual gathering."

There's so much I want to say in response to this, but right now my mind is foggy, it is numb from trying to dull the pain and confusion that this pandemic has so suddenly caused. However. I will try my best (and may that annoying little self-conscious fucker of a voice in the back of my head that tells me not to post unless I'm being witty, be silenced).

What we are seeing now is the rise of the creatives. This virus is killing off the weak, and in exchange it is exposing the frauds of our societies. It is also giving us back the time that austerity has stolen from its people, which in turn, gives its survivors the chance at making something beautiful out of the settlement from the last of the decades dust. This 'sLUm' generation that the blog refers to is the most informed, most equipped, and advantageous beings of our time. We have access to privileges that past pandemics didn't have. And while we loathe the negative implications that Capitalism has put us under for so long, it has also given us this chance right now to access those privileges and run wild with the wind. Isolation is the sweet spot for self-reflection, for you are no longer being influenced or influencing others, the herd mentality dies in a sense. In essence, this self-isolating and social-distancing commandment that looks and feels like a punishment being inflicted upon us, is actually a get-out-of-jail free card for the mind to finally take a break. The rats stop running their races all over the world when they realize that their very own bodies are vessels that carry fleas. We become aware again. Awareness is essential for surviving these times of mental ill health. 

Everybody has the capacity to sit and make peace with their thoughts. To think about who they really are outside of their social circles. In turn, you will find an unfamiliar emotion that hasn't been felt since the 90s. That emotion is boredom. Boredom is where creativity thrives. That's where you become imaginative, resorting to the only resources you have within your radius. For some people that might be binge watching things, for others that might be cooking. Whatever you do, that is your time, and it's always been there for you to play with. Try not to feed the fire of the virus that kills outside. There are people out there who really care and are doing everything in their ability to try and make this better. For the rest that sit isolated in fear wondering when they will get their lives back - don't. You already have your life, and it's about to get better if you can create something from this turmoil."

Now I fear I’m going to start bingeing + no motivation to exercise at home has me freaking out and feeling suicidal. Honestly, I feel trapped. Not just inside my own head anymore, but literally trapped in a world which denies me my comforts. Fuck this. I’m better off dead."

My 18yr old cousin went with a huge group of friends a couple years back, and I was so sure they would love it (who wouldn't?) but it wasn't for them, and they barely left their tents. They didn't like D&B and they found it too loud and too crowded. Last year, one of my mates friends left us after the first day because it wasn't for him.

In my opinion it IS spectacular. I'm biased despite having been to many UK and abroad festivals, because Boomtown caters to all of my music interests and sense of humor. I do understand why some people don't like it -- at the end of the day its still a scummy squat rave no matter how much you dress it up with lights and theatricals.

Having said that, just go with an open-mind, don't let people predetermine your fate. Go without any expectations and you'll know by the first day whether you can get stuck in to it or not. The option to leave once you're there always stands."
