2cb,fobcue2,t1_fobcjfi,1587658512.0,okay good haha. it was extremely frightening at first because on my first dose i got absolutely no visuals and then suddenly the faces on my screen were dissolving. once i realised i was okay i had a good trip but none of my friends had reported that intensity before
2cb,fobc44h,t3_g6pg34,1587658314.0,every face i saw on my screen did the same thing - it was so so much like my last acid trip that i started to wonder if i‚Äôd accidentally taken the wrong substance or something but i still didn‚Äôt develop a major headspace so i‚Äôm convinced it was 2cb. as well as that video it was exactly accurate to this link https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dncWTBP1zfk just with added breathing and movement
2cb,fnil3bh,t1_fnil152,1586981867.0,gonna try that now thank you !
AnorexiaNervosa,fnb3bei,t3_g0nmn7,1586808476.0,i also reached a healthy weight today ! we can do this
RATS,fjx7gmr,t1_fjwej86,1583660379.0,yes !! i‚Äôve posted other even squishier videos of him on the sub before if you look at my profile
RATS,fjx78yn,t1_fjwz4fd,1583660071.0,"my advice would be to continue lifting them out of their cage to come out but not in a forceful way. if they‚Äôre under shelter then don‚Äôt remove them, maybe wait until they‚Äôre getting food or water and gently lift them out. when they‚Äôre out try not to grab them or stroke them, just sit with them and allow them to walk on you and approach you. rats loveeee being covered up so if you have a big jumper maybe sit and encourage them to hide inside that so that they can get used to your smell without feeling exposed"
RATS,fjx730h,t1_fjwt04b,1583659839.0,it took me maybe three months to get to this stage but the main reason these guys are so cuddly is because of the breeder they came from. they were handled really well in the first few weeks after birth so they‚Äôve always been comfortable with people
RATS,f6wsvjc,t1_f6wc1gy,1573234092.0,too chonky to hold with one hand and he loves it when i massage his back
RATS,f6usl0x,t1_f6uov9n,1573167721.0,he‚Äôs the most cuddly rat i‚Äôve ever had

RATS,f44938d,t1_f4490gg,1571349384.0,he wants you to squidge !!
RATS,f2mz6o0,t1_f2mvknw,1570310030.0,i‚Äôve had 5 pairs of rats now and they all seem to come in this dynamic. one of them is always quiet and cuddly and the others is full of energy
RATS,f0zjs6j,t1_f0zh8wi,1569097045.0,that is adorable
RATS,f0o1iv6,t1_f0o1ecw,1568789944.0,trust me we‚Äôve put lots and lots of thought into this. he‚Äôs been unable to walk for a while now too and we‚Äôve had to put him in a much smaller cage because his younger friends kept being too rough with him in the big cage and hurting him. i‚Äôd love for him to live forever but he can no longer properly clean himself and is at the point where his quality of life is about to become nothing
RATS,f0nzzab,t1_f0njfow,1568787769.0,he‚Äôs still enjoying life at the moment but his back legs are completely collapsed with age and i want to put him down peacefully before he‚Äôs in any kind of pain
RATS,f0nzxu6,t1_f0nulym,1568787713.0,thankyou so much üíò
RATS,f0bup5j,t1_f09phri,1568532060.0,he does üíñ
RATS,f0bunhk,t1_f0bi2tf,1568532043.0,yes it‚Äôs very very important that they aren‚Äôt alone so either get them a new friend or give them to a home with other ratties :)
RATS,f0buhzp,t1_f0b4q9a,1568531989.0,nearly 3 now :)
RATS,f08y1ui,t1_f08q8g8,1568490135.0,he is huge !!
RATS,eyqcit4,t1_eyqcdgk,1567337367.0,aweee I am very lucky to have such a loving animal
RATS,eyqcc1g,t1_eyqbqy3,1567337099.0,Thankyou :‚Äô))) he is the sweetest creature
RATS,eyp0kct,t1_eyp0d1t,1567287027.0,Thankyou :)
RATS,eyldub4,t1_eyldlhj,1567182191.0,his names Duckie after the character from John Hughes‚Äô ‚Äòpretty in pink‚Äô
RATS,eykvo86,t1_eykvfrt,1567169452.0,the perfect thing about this baby‚Äôs situation is that he shares a cage with my oldest rat who‚Äôs nearly three years old. Neither of them are very active for obvious reasons and they spend most of their time cuddled up together in one of their little houses. They love eachother a lot and spend a lot of time grooming eachother. He also spends a lot of time out of the cage with me where he gets lots of treats and uses my hand to hop along and explore everything.
RATS,eyku47i,t1_eyku2i2,1567168123.0,I know :( he still has a remarkably good quality of life and is in no pain but it‚Äôs obviously not an ideal condition
RATS,eyktwb4,t1_eykqt6o,1567167929.0,he doesn‚Äôt have proper function in his legs and has majorly stunted growth
RATS,eyknb9o,t3_cxew2a,1567160827.0,"Basically the only thing you can do is give them time. Make sure their cage has lots of sheltered and cosy hiding places where they can go to feel safe and protected. Leave some treats around the cage for them to explore and collect, and make sure you only pick them up from open places in the cage (rather than reaching into their hiding places to lift them out). Their cage needs to be a place they know they can retreat to and be left alone in, so as long as you respect that they‚Äôll be settled and happy within a few days"
RATS,eykm6ar,t1_eykjqgf,1567159197.0,mostly I just use my hand as his back legs and he propells himself forward with his front ones but I might look into that
RATS,eyjdbkz,t1_eyjd9ty,1567117056.0,He slither
RATS,eyizqs5,t1_eyiq1i5,1567110061.0,Thankyou :))))
RATS,eyiqb1a,t1_eyippth,1567106045.0,Thankyou !! Rex fur is so lovely to stroke and he‚Äôs such a cuddly boy
RATS,eyioj2a,t1_eyio37a,1567105240.0,I‚Äôm actually not sure what condition he has but that could be it. He was very active and able as a baby but his coordination and leg power started deteriorating a few weeks after we got him. He‚Äôs clearly in no pain and still loves life and is one of the most affectionate animals I‚Äôve ever owned
RATS,eyin8cz,t1_eyimoi9,1567104721.0,that‚Äôs so strange. I guess all the signs are pointing towards it not being a problem so hopefully they‚Äôll be alright
RATS,eyim4d7,t3_cx4yt9,1567104280.0,I‚Äôm not an expert on this but my advice would be to listen closely for chest rattles. Hold your rat up to your eat and see if you can hear any clicking or rattling from their lungs. Sneezing could be a sign of respiratory issues and some rats are much more prone to those than others. If there‚Äôs no rattling and their chest sounds healthy then I wouldn‚Äôt worry. If they‚Äôre active and eating well and aren‚Äôt behaving in any worrying way then you‚Äôre probably fine. Does sound odd though I‚Äôve never had particularly sneezy rats. Do they get any porphyrin (red sticky stuff) around their eyes or noses? When my rats are sneezy they usually get this too which can signify that they‚Äôre a bit under the weather - kind of like a human cold
AnorexiaNervosa,evgcti5,t1_evfwsyh,1564508814.0,"I understand what you‚Äôre saying and not eating those foods is completely your own choice but maybe an anorexia sub isn‚Äôt the best place to demonise a whole food group.  Junk foods are already a fear food for most people with eating disorders and, while it‚Äôs up to you what you put in your body, I think eating what you want when you want without guilt is much more important than worrying about it‚Äôs content (calories and ‚Äòcrap‚Äô alike)."
EatingDisorders,esrpesf,t3_c90ab4,1562232365.0,"An ED specialist therapist will be the only way for your daughter to recover. It‚Äôs impossible for someone without the disorder/without training in the disorder to understand its mechanisms because it‚Äôs a very illogical condition. The only things you can do outside of professional counselling are making sure your daughter knows that she can trust you and speak to you whenever she wants to. As an anorexic teenagers myself the most helpful thing my mum does for me is taking me to buy my own food from supermarkets. Your daughter is much more likely to eat if she can select her own safe foods and count the calories in shop bought food rather than eating home cooked meals. The disorder is all about control and, even though this isn‚Äôt a sustainable system, giving her as much control over what she eats as possible might encourage her to eat at least some food, rather than nothing at all. Once the anorexic mind has been activated it‚Äôs nearly impossible to combat it alone, so get her on to that ED specific therapist as soon as possible."
AnorexiaNervosa,erf8lp3,t3_c1se85,1560802547.0,maybe speak to him and explain the control element of the disorder and perhaps compromise on a way to restrict at a less dangerous level?? It‚Äôs hard when people without anorexia try to help because they can‚Äôt possibly understand the fear attached to food but maybe try and help him understand that what he‚Äôs doing is actually making things more intense. Hope things get better for you ‚ù§Ô∏è
