Luckily, most states REQUIRE continuing education before you can renew your license every year/two years/whatever it may be. Take this time to find and go to classes. Take notes. Stay excited. Don’t let your bad school experience drag you down. You’re almost free. 

My last school didn’t allow us to teach Brazilians and it got to the point where the director REFUSED to buy the students a little can of shitty GiGi wax because “they’re going through it too fast” so they then couldn’t practice on much of anything else.

AskReddit,fqp0v87,t3_gk52v1,1589531046.0,"I have an ex friend that my ex boyfriend would call “single white female” ONLY. It was so bad he didnt say her name and called her that for years. Eventually I started to casually say things on Facebook (when I had it) like “dying my hair black tomorrow night! So excited so be a spooky girl again” and she would run out for a $3 box of black dye, and do it/post it within a few hours, while I was actually going platinum/basically white. The following week she was stripping her hair and once it got to a brassy level she announced “I’m blonde again!”

I said something about shopping at a mall and a few hours later, she was posting about being there as I was leaving. 

She bought puppies in the same breed as I had, and when I quit talking to her she neglected them and they died. She specifically blamed me to others, saying “I hated those mutts because they reminded me of that other mutt” regarding me. 

She bought glasses when she had 20/20 vision and I’m legally blind. 

Whenever she COULDNT copy me.... oh god the insults were bad, or she’d take credit for it. I made a marbled rainbow cake, she attempted cheesecake and it looked like pastel puke. The caption on the photo was “any idiot can make a colored cake, but can they do a cheesecake?”. I did, in fact, make a neon cheesecake with zero trouble. Not sure why hers looked pale like it did. 

Even down to what phone I used she was talking shit about it, then she upgraded and got the newer version of mine and talked about how much better it was and she wasn’t a hypocrite because mine still sucked, bla bla bla. ITS A PHONE! 🙄

Two years after not speaking to her I got into a wreck because someone was texting through a redlight. An HOUR later she was screeching on Facebook about “karma” and car wrecks and I got fed up and texted her and told her to stop stalking me. She used her famous excuse of “not about you but if the shoe fits” then accused me of “distracting her from her grandmother being laid up in the hospital right now”. She told me & my friend defending me (that also walked away from her crazy life) “I hope both of you get raped and die”. A year later to the DAY.... my friend died during childbirth, and this person had the audacity to sign her guestbook as if she didn’t wish for this to happen. I still have that shit, too. Me and my friend even discussed if I were to die, to not let her come around. I just didn’t believe I would have had to do the same thing a year later for her instead of me. 

She basically was a in real life version of her internet troll self & I was terrified to break it off because I knew the obsessive lies would start. Once she obsessively kept calling her kid the R slur I had enough. I walked out and blocked and never looked back.  She did stalk me & lie about me and STILL lies about me to this day, but she’s being pimped out by her new dude for cocaine apparently... I can’t really get angry at her lies about me when her life sucks that bad I guess."
