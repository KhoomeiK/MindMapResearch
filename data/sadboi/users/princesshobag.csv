AskWomen,fls14gi,t3_fqpk65,1585432134.0,"Daughter’s perspective:

I don’t think our relationship has really changed. I don’t particularly like my mom, but I feel that I have to check up on her (and my dad) since I’m an only child. I call nearly everyday and have for years. My parents have always acted very old and as they are now in their mid-60s, I feel like their age is finally catching up to their personalities. Growing up, she never understood the need for privacy; a fine example is when I found out about her reading in my journal. She also had to read all my school reports and assignments. She claims she doesn’t remember any of this (and many other things). She has an undiagnosed mental illness, and I think it has a lot to do with how she acts and has affected her memory. She’s also never really taken care of her body, and her mobility has greatly deteriorated. Her primary concern over the years was taking care of her parents across the country; she would drive cross-country to be with them for a few weeks every other month or so. They’re both gone now, and she just has stagnated. I should also note that after moving to a different t state over 6 years ago, she’s only visited us once, and my dad had to convince her to come. 

She’s never been good with people, uninterested in crafts/hobbies, and hasn’t worked in over 30 years; connecting with her gets harder and harder every year. She’s also very judgmental and “devout” in a Jesus-way, which made things very hard for me as I tend to have a rebellious personality and challenge things that don’t make sense to me.  Over time, our phone calls are just her telling me the news, what the weather is like, what the birds are doing, and maybe any movies/shows she watches. I can’t really tell her anything about my life or interests as it usually causes an argument or some judgmental response. Anything we do discuss is very superficial. 

I think mothers and daughters are able to be friends if the mother allows the daughter to grow as an adult and if the daughters start to see their mothers as a person. I, unfortunately, will never experience that."
