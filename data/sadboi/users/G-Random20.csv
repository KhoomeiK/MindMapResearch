I think the idea that you should avoid political violence against Nazis because it might break into a ""civil war"" is a stupid one.

There are fascists in the US mainstream media, sponsored by billionaires to spread their trash propaganda. Generally fascists today don't say ""I'm fascist"", they say ""I'm anti Antifa"". 

And people that claim that Antifa is too violent or whatever seem to have a hard time saying ""Fuck the Nazis, fuck the alt-right."" Shouldn't be so hard to say.

Doing nothing and hoping that the cops deal with it when it's already too late comes across as indifference. Now i assume you're not a socialist and anti-state so i won't go all revolutionary about how much i disagree with that position.

If fascists wouldn't act, but would rather just stay closeted and theorize their sub-human ideology than i'd think that yes, physical violence is not necessary at that point.

Well they also killed innocent people. And i'm talking about the Nazis today when i say that.

I get what you're trying to say but, i think political violence is justified sometimes.

Let's say we have some Nazis that are holding up some ""Gas the Jews"" signs.

I'm going to explain to you my position and you can agree or disagree and share your position as well. 

First of all, i would never try to debate them. As i said, when you debate someone you automatically validate their position somewhat just by taking it into consideration. 

By assaulting them you make them uncomfortable. They'll think twice next time they want to spread their propaganda. If you do nothing, you're just enabling them. 

Now i see you place your trust in the law. Now idk if you're from the US, but Trump called the Nazis from the Unite The Right rally from Charlottesville ""fine people"". The cops were also poorly organised that day and didn't handle the situation well. One Nazi drove his car into a crowd of protesters and actually killed someone. You've probably heard of this.

I just can't understand how you can say that violence isn't justified when their very ideology advocates genocide. Even if you assault them, you still have the moral high ground. If you punch them in the face you're still leaps and bounds better than them, because you're not one of them.

They just want to listen to their hard bass and shitpost gulag/stalin memes.

The problem is that centrists, liberals, apolitical people etc. will probably stumble upon that subreddit if they want to learn about the left. When they'll interact with tankies, they'll think that  the left is full of lunatics. They make us look bad.

Meanwhile, fascists today drop the swastikas and dress in suits, making their way into mainstream politics, calling themselves ""conservatives"". With the help of think thanks sponsored by their billionaire sugar daddies, they spread their propaganda. Tankies themselves help spread their propaganda by the way they act. Fascists today don't say ""we support fascism"". No, they say ""we want to overthrow the terrorist, leftist organization Antifa"".

It is our duty to try and educate people about our concepts and ideas, to educate them about what REALLY means to be a leftist. 

We need people on our side."
