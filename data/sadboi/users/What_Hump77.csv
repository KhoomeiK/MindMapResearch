SuicideWatch,ffsl64o,t1_ffsg95n,1580184440.0,"Ugh, that's stupid. I can understand limiting meds for milder cases, but yours seems more severe. When it comes down to it, would they rather take a risk and medicate a patient or have the patient die? I feel like you should be allowed to try medication if that's something you want to do. I'm sorry.

Therapy is better than nothing, but I wish there was more they'd do for you."
SuicideWatch,ffsg3xx,t1_ffsajr6,1580180864.0,"I'm surprised that 21 is deemed to be too young. What country do you live in? If you're in the US, is there a low cost clinic you could go to? It's better to be medicated than dead."
SuicideWatch,ffsaesb,t3_euycir,1580177037.0,"Hey there. I'm sorry you're feeling so horrible. I'm also sorry that you're not getting the support you need from your family. You deserve better.

Are you on medication for depression? It can help sometimes. (Then again, sometimes it can make things even worse, or do nothing at all. Not claiming that it's magic.)

I'm not sure what else to say. I mainly just want you to know that I hear you and that I hope your pain begins to fade soon."
SuicideWatch,ffs9e3k,t3_euvbb7,1580176346.0,"You said that you'll probably delete this, but please don't. It was helpful for me to read how much your attempt impacted those around you and how much their reactions impacted you. I imagine it might help some other people to read this, too.

I hope things continue to get better for you and that someday your suicidal thoughts will be just a memory. Until then... well, I'll quote you since you said it pretty well:

>please stay strong. This shit isnt easy, but I believe in you. You can do this."
SuicideWatch,ff064ky,t3_er1h7l,1579465623.0,"I hear you on the sleep thing - it really sucks when you can't wake up for work or stay away while you're there. It's not like people are understanding if you fall short in that department. You're supposed to be able to make yourself function like you're supposed to... but you can't. 

It's hard to find reasons to keep trying when it seems like you can't even reach the minimal level of functioning required to be a functional member of society. 

I don't have any advice to offer. I just wanted to let you know that I hear you."
SuicideWatch,f7z4qxe,t3_dy49lr,1574105292.0,"Hey, are you there?

Life sucks. I wish I could say things will get better, but I don't like lying. Okay, this isn't very uplifting. But I want you to know that I care and am thinking about you."
SuicideWatch,f7mo3n9,t1_f7lwi9c,1573868715.0,Thanks for the advice - I appreciate it.
mentalhealth,f5609co,t3_dmyjnu,1572016540.0,I'll be excited with/for you! It really is a much bigger deal than some people realize.
SuicideWatch,f4eh3s8,t3_dkg26k,1571557821.0,Thank you for helping others even when you were hurting so much inside. I'm sorry things seem so hopeless - that's a horrible feeling. I hope you change your mind and don't go through with this. And I hope things get better for you soon.
SuicideWatch,f4efv7i,t3_dkgegd,1571557284.0,"In general, you won't get locked up in a hospital unless you indicate that you pose an immediate danger to yourself or others. If you admit to having a plan that you intend to carry out very soon, the odds of freedom are not in your favor. If you talk about urges to die without having a specific plan in mind, you're in better shape. 

You could try asking hypothetical questions to see how your therapist answers. 

Are you able to promise the therapist you won't try to kill yourself before your next appointment? If so, that bodes in your favor."
SuicideWatch,f4ee6w3,t3_dkg3tk,1571556521.0,"I have two main reactions to this:

1) I'm glad you're still alive

2) I'm so sorry. You think it's finally over... then it isn't. Crushing disappointment.

What now? I don't know. Maybe just go back to trying to live, as painful and unappealing as that sounds? I hope things get better for you soon."
SuicideWatch,f4ec4ed,t3_dk4rls,1571555552.0,"I'm sorry that you're having such a rough time. That feeling of peace is hard to move on from. I got it when I was on my way to death, too. For once, everything felt right. I didn't have to worry about anything anymore. 

I hope the weight on your shoulders gets lighter and things get easier for you soon."
