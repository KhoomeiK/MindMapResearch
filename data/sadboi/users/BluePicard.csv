He was physically abusive to my brother however. I have a vague memory of older getting his hair combed and my dad was being rough about it. I can confirm that getting your hair by my dad was painful. He had no patience. The other part of that memory was me hiding around the corner his bedroom, which had a small filthy bathroom. I could hear my older brother crying, then all of a sudden, he was launched out of bathroom from cannon onto the bed.  Like I said before, this is a very vague memory and it could be a dream. Though I doubt it. Like you, despite being male, I sought out approval and put others before myself. I haven't seen my dad since 2005 but we communicate through emails giving each other obligatory birthday wishes. I feel guilty for not having a relationship despite knowing that he never bothered to make one when we lived together. It just feels like I have unfinished business with him. At the same time I feel like you when it comes to my father dying. But thank you for telling us your story. I feel little better now and I appreciate it."
