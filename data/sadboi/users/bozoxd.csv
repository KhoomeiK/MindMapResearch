First, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but seller gets his money back if the product is lost. Second, to keep what item ffs? It‚Äôs been 2 months since it‚Äôs been shipped and 1 month in transit. I‚Äôm pretty sure it got lost and will not ever arrive. That‚Äôs the deal. Third, How am I abusing the system? I basically fucked myself in the ass cuz now if it doesn‚Äôt arrive (most likely won‚Äôt) I need to wait another 2 months until I get my money back.
