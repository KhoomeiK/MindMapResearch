The intrusive thoughts cause me to feel the need to do certain things in order to feel in control. Such as only filling my car up at pump number 8... even if it meant I was late to work and knew I‚Äôd be in trouble. The fear of what would happen if I didn‚Äôt use pump number 8 overruled the fact that I could lose my job. No I was not born with OCD, I suffer from OCD obsessions due to PTSD (from abuse I experienced over years as a child). Also, I also have a child that is on the Autism Spectrum. I‚Äôm not spreading false info.... OCD is a spectrum disorder like any mental health condition. Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, Autism, PTSD. It‚Äôs not the same for everyone.
