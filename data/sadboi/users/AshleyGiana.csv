This can just few like any other day at times and we don’t understand why people are so sad.”

She also said something about how now that the chaos is here it can almost be comfortable because we have the emotional preparation for it. Felt pretty accurate."

BPDmemes,fdib1hn,t1_fdh35x2,1578438978.0,"Compulsions are at their base “rituals”, Obsessions consist of intrusive thoughts that provoke anxiety. I have been having “Obsessions” increasingly since I became sober 9 years ago, as Ive begun to remember the trauma I experienced. The intrusive thoughts cause me to feel the need to do certain things in order to feel in control. Such as only filling my car up at pump number 8... even if it meant I was late to work and knew I’d be in trouble. The fear of what would happen if I didn’t use pump number 8 overruled the fact that I could lose my job. No I was not born with OCD, I suffer from OCD obsessions due to PTSD (from abuse I experienced over years as a child). Also, I also have a child that is on the Autism Spectrum. I’m not spreading false info.... OCD is a spectrum disorder like any mental health condition. Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, Autism, PTSD. It’s not the same for everyone. Your obsessions or compulsions may be completely different of stronger or whatever than someone else that has OCD or delayed OCD behavior onset. Don’t assume everyone is the same as you. 

And it’s a meme... chill."

We had dental insurance... 25 years later I went to a dentist that was horrified I had been through 3 sets of “temporary caps” in 25 years. They are supposed to last around 6 months max. My teeth had just been wearing away and I hadn’t bitten into anything harder than a saltine cracker in 20 years. Anyways, fast forward to last month. The dentist (amazing) made 4 beautiful crowns for my front 4 teeth. I have Medicaid but after hearing my story he sent them to a private lab that does better than average work. I cried for days after getting them in. I didn’t even realize how self conscious I had truly become until after. The pain that I let go of was amazing... from teeth...
