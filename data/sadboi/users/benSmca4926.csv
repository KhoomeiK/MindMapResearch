AirForce,flh9764,t1_flh5a9i,1585158401.0,">You would have to be off those meds for at least two years to even attempt to join the Air Force

wow. fucking great.

> you cannot say ‚Äúdo more harm than good‚Äù because the Air Force is not your last resort.

what i meant by that is that I was looking at this as a way to finally get some direction in life. Since thats the main reason on why I feel down most of the time. And the funny thing is that I have felt this way for couple years now and I think I have done a pretty good job with dealing with it without any meds. 

I guess what I am really mad about is how me seeking help and not just staying silent, took away this opportunity from me; if that makes any sense idk. I am fit health young adult male. I ran the 2018 marathon and I go to gym (sometimes). With a few months in training I could most likely beat the physical requirements.   Other than my than my depression I can do what is required of me. I just wanted to feel proud of my life. I absolutely hate where I am now. Thats why I was I hoping the AF could give me so kind of heading. 

thank you for the advice stranger"

I am just trying to get out this fucking shit hole that is my life and make something of myself. I have only been on these meds less than a month b/c i was finally able to afford insurance and just when I think I can finally start doing something, this happens. Sorry for the rant, I was just hoping this world would at least take easy but I guess not. 

The funny thing is that this rejection is most likely going to do more harm than good since I was counting on this as my last resort. Now I don't know what to do. ANy advice is welcome. thank you and god bless the us air force."
