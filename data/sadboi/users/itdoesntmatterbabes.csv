Psychonaut,flfb6x8,t3_focy1k,1585102241.0,"This has been happening to me almost every night before I go to bed since I’ve been a kid. I would always try to explain it to people what my body and I were going through before bed but no one could understand it. 

Sometimes before I go to bed; I feel as if I am everything in one; looking at myself, but I am myself, but I am also far away, and I can feel all these sensations. Beautiful sensations all over my body. A feeling of home, warmth, and as if I’m literally everything; a glowing embodiment feeling. I am the thing I am staring at, I am the thing behind the thing staring at the thing. I am everything.

It’s a very very euphoric feeling.

I can’t explain it as well as you guys can.

But I’m here to say, I have this too.

The first time I tried mushrooms; I had an ego death. But while I was tripping, I realized life is just a thing within a thing. Never ending. Never. Ending. The universe is one psychedelic big trip dancing and swirling. We are so blessed to be apart of the universe being aware of itself. We got lucky with such a consciousness. F*ck yeah baby!!"

Allowing him to process this on his own, keeping the lizard thing in check and once he experiences ego death; you’re right, everything will soon be stripped away and he can truly build from their on up on what this magnificent reality truly is. You’re completely right, some of us start off at different stages. He was raised differently, he sees the world much more different and he’ll get through all of this in his own time, figuring it all out for himself. What you said was very beautiful.

Shits RUDE bro. 

But otherwise he’s fine, he’s actually really really amazing and we are a lot alike. But then that side comes out when he brings up aliens and stuff. 

It’s just not what every girl would like to hear. 

And thank you so much for the kind words, that really means a lot to me :,)"
Psychonaut,fj0ab87,t1_fj0a4eq,1582894641.0,"I understand that, but why is he blaming me to be the only reptilian in this relationship then?

I’ll try to talk to him and see if he’s dead serious about this. Because if not, it’s rude to say that to me. In a way, I mean fuck.. makes me second guess myself in some ways.

Psychonaut,fj08xbf,t1_fj08c81,1582893413.0,"I’m not very judgmental, I just try to keep an open mind about how everyone views life. In the end, no one is truly wrong or right because it’s your reality, your mind and how you perceive things. 

He’s not always like this, he’s very genuine and actually very very amazing. But sometimes I think it’s all an act if he thinks I’m a god damn lizard person. 

I’m just wondering why he’s still around if he thinks that way about me."
Psychonaut,fj08qqt,t1_fj08aph,1582893242.0,"He’s only done shrooms a couple times and acid once. He’s thought this way for a very long time before drugs. And always watches documentaries on it and always is observing people. At one point he thought I was a sociopath, I’m not sure if that’s a joke or... because he brings it up a lot. But he always then makes a joke out of it. But again, vibe kill, you’re my boyfriend and we should be homies not “is she secretly a reptilian?”. At the beginning of our relationship he asked if I was a robot because I had never sneezed or coughed, but you only sneeze or cough when you need to so I guess I didn’t need to? 

But I agree, he’s taking shrooms too seriously as in what he sees/thinks he’s taking it way too seriously. When he should realize, is it a poisonous mushroom, we must remember. 

I don’t know, makes me paranoid when he thinks these things about me because of insecurities so I’m like fuck dude, am I demonic? Which isn’t cool to make someone question themselves like that."
Psychonaut,fj08355,t1_fj07rgw,1582892622.0,"I feel you. But he says people who think this way (like he needs help) he thinks people who say that are claiming that he’s crazy because you aren’t open minded enough and are brainwashed by the society you live in because they taught you to think people like him are crazy but in reality he thinks he is beyond “woke”. 

I try to be open minded and understanding where he’s coming from because I don’t really judge, as I said we’re all trying to get out alive. 

But, I couldn’t imagine being in that reality where I was untruth worthy of the people around me were lizard people? That seems like a very hard reality to be in. 

I’m also blinded by love, so you do think he may be on the brink of insanity or what?"
Psychonaut,fj07f9r,t1_fj0748b,1582891971.0,"He says he loves them and wants to try DMT and see if the Earth is flat too. He just wants to know for real. Which makes me think, he’s got a paranoid personality. 

Psychedelics to me, were a beautiful mind opening experience to where I got to see how the earth truly was, the trees were breathing, my visions was clear and I looked in the mirror and was very proud of who I was. I was proud of my avatar and how she’s been through so much and has turned out very great. Those were beautiful experiences I needed to grow my mind.

But when he uses these drugs, he’s using them to escape from reality. He’s not using them as a sacred tool to open his mind. And the fact he sees me as a reptilian person just it’s a complete vibe kill...


Wouldn’t he know if he should stay away from them, as he would be freaking out with anxiety? Because on shrooms he’s very calm."
BPD,fj04ovk,t1_fj00ld9,1582888916.0,"Oh yeah I have that big time.. more days than not my reality is altered and I feel between dimensions.

My eyes start to hurt and I just feel like I’m not alive but I don’t necessarily feel like I’m not my body. I just feel like I’m between dimensions. 

Does that sound like it or is that something different? I just always feel like I’m losing my mind when that happens and I just cry a lot and then take a 0.5 of Xanax and that helps.

Edit: I don’t have other identities. I’m just this avatar. Although the avatar I play, is everything in one. She is a pain in the ass. I wish I had another identity."

BPD,fih345k,t1_fih0x0e,1582405998.0,"It’s probably because I’m very unhappy with everything in my life. I don’t have a job, I haven’t seen the sun, I don’t do anything good for myself because I blame it on other things and never take full responsibility for anything, in return I’m very mean to the people who unconditionally love me (my mom) which also makes things worse. I’ve actually had a lot of trauma but I’ve never expressed it. I’ve covered up everything with sarcastic jokes and lying to myself but deep down I have a lot of issues. I’ve always been a terrible child though. And I’m pretty sure I got the right love but I was always so spoiled that I didn’t have any discipline or structure. So I’m kind of just lost at this point. I’m not really sure. I also just haven’t seen the sun which really sucks badly and there’s nothing to do in Alaska. I’m not taking my medication and my boyfriend is deployed which makes my anxiety go up the walls. 

I dissociate because I’m not doing anything with my brain except staring at my phone really or the same four walls. And I’m mean to my mother which makes me dissociate/anxiety attacks because i get scared with who to turn to in times of need. I just feel like she should turn on me for her own right. I’m always afraid my boyfriend will leave me because I love too much. I don’t know, I’ve been through a lot and my brain takes things very dramatically and traumatically no matter what. I can’t even go into stores without getting scared and scratching my arms and hands up. 

I’m mentally unstable and not on any medication or working with myself at all so I think that is my main issue. I just don’t know where to start. My mom fights with me a lot and brings me down and makes me mean to hurt and I lock myself inside my room. We are very toxic towards each other but then loving. It’s sad. And I’ve gone through a lot of issues but when I say I’ve never dealt with them, I haven’t. I’ve gone through SO much but I felt like shoving them deep down was best and making jokes out of it because what else am I suppose to do. 

So I just take Xanax everyday just to get by."

BPD,ffw90vo,t1_ffw6t5p,1580290242.0,"Right, same here. Same age. I remember in 3rd grade I didn’t want to be at school, so I told the nurse I was puking up blood (I knew that if I said that she would have to send me home) but she said she needed evidence if I was puking up blood so I took my little kool-aid packet, went into the bathroom and put the powder in a sandwich bag and gagged myself and shook it all together then brought it to her. She the called my mom and my mom talked to me and was like “are you sure you’re puking up blood?” (I lied a lot) and I started crying and using a certain voice saying “yes I don’t know what’s going on something is wrong mom, I need help, badly.” I was rushed to the hospital (backfire) and I had to do cat scans all day. They then got my blood test results back and turns out it was kool-aid. I then looked at my mom and said “can we go home now?”

I hated school and would do anything to get out of it. I could never do anything in school right. When they were teaching us how to write, my teacher would get mad at me because I came up with my own handwriting that I thought was beautiful. I always got F’s for being different and myself. So I constantly rebelled at a young age. I rarely ever went to school. So they put me on ADHD medication which backfired hard and I started hearing “voices” which was my teachers voice, I hated him and he never accepted me, so the voice would tell me to do bad things (it was actually my consciousness) they weren’t bad things, it was more like “go into the woods at recess even though you aren’t allowed.” the teachers not accepting me, and me putting through so much with medication put a lot of stress on me. 

The school system is completely messed up. I refused to be a robot.

It’s sad looking back on how that was my experience. 

So I learned at a young age that if people won’t let me be myself, I would just manipulate and lie my way through life and I would do anything to get my way. If you didn’t give me my way, I instantly hated you. You were a burden to my life.

If my parents ever told me no, I would scream and tell them how much I hated them. 

I would completely split. Which is sad.

I felt as though if I am here in this world, I am here to do what I want and get what I want. 

Which I still find somewhat true."

That’s the most special, most beautiful thing in the world. Whoever hurt you, shows something about themselves rather than about you. People who hurt other people are hurting or have been deeply hurt before so it’s a defense mechanism. It’s hard not to take it personal but we must try to remember that. They are hurting so they spread the hurt to others because it’s all they know, but someone who isn’t hurting, would never do that to you. Feel bad for them, wish them the best in the end with what they’re suffering with deeply in their mind and move on knowing you’ve done your best and showed all the love you could and keep loving like you’ve never been hurt! 🤗💗"
BPD,fdyz8a5,t1_fdyqpbn,1578785070.0,"That’s true, I always see someone as terrible to me if we are breaking up. No matter what. I’ll always think of something they hurt my feelings on and I’ll stick to that. I think it’s a defense mechanism to not get hurt in the end. All of my relationships have been toxic, especially with people nowadays trying to act like they have no feelings, play games, etc."
BPD,fdyz03u,t1_fdyley1,1578784989.0,"That’s beautiful. I love that so much :,) you know that it doesn’t work between you two as a couple but as best friends who are truly there for each other, that’s important!"
BPD,fdyypps,t1_fdyx7un,1578784888.0,"That’s crazy. I’ve always just disappeared from their life. I just leave one day and say never talk to me again and that’s the end of it and then they obsess over me and it makes me hate them more. I feel like I give people my all when I’m in a relationship and when they can’t live up to it I start to resent them and then once we are done I want nothing to do with them because they’re my ex. Stay away from me. I’ve had you I don’t want you anymore. And I feel like I also do that so I don’t get hurt by them if I cut them completely off. I feel like humans are always out to win the relationship or hurt each other and I can’t have that at the end of it all. I always have to be the first to go, to block."
introvert,fdxz0oi,t3_en5y83,1578774327.0,Yeah I have to pop a Xanax. Sitting there makes me want to die. Also just something about it erks me. Terrifying sometimes.
BPD,fcwh7t9,t1_fcv3mx9,1578025547.0,That’s very true. I completely agree. We just have a hard time regularity our emotions. Our emotions are like a heart beat. Rocking mountain type shit.
BPD,fcwh2pk,t1_fcv7zib,1578025440.0,I feel that! That is me. I’m super energetic and then I know deep down it won’t last and I’m like NoOoOoOOOO!!

LETS GET HYPHY! LETS GET HYPHY! LETS GET HYPHY!

2-3 hours later..

*worrying*

Am I too much? I feel like I’m too much.. I’ve embarrassed myself once again. Everyone must think I’m insane!"
BPD,fcr5ks7,t1_fcr4udt,1577897107.0,"Haha very true very true... 

Also while you’re here... while I was on the phone with my boyfriend the other day, we were talking about something and I had mentioned that the “male ego is very fragile” and he repeated back to me “the male ego is very fragile?” I said “well duh, of course!” And we moved on from that subject, I can’t remember what was said before or after I just know I said it. Now I’m worried that he thinks I’m insane and views men has insecure as if I look down on males. But that’s not what I was talking about at all. I hope he’s not upset and thinks I’m sexist...  what if he breaks up with me about that ugh why... I wish I was mute."
BPD,fcpki4h,t1_fcphrgn,1577866337.0,"Me too!! I completely feel you on that! 

Here is what I wrote on love:

Love is all you need
Love is caring for each other
Taking care of one another
Letting them know they are safe 
Letting them know they are never alone
Who knows if there is a god but I know there is love 
The human emotion of love is so amazing and so important 
We can conquer the world with love
Conquer the universe 
Come together as one 
Love is the answer 
Love will always be the answer"
Anxiety,fcp3vph,t1_fcof345,1577849664.0,I feel that. I would have too! Sensory overload. And that’s exactly what I was going to do! I have my noise canceling Bose headphones and a .5mg Xanax for the wonderful new year! 😂
Anxiety,fco8jxb,t1_fco19yj,1577826163.0,I know right. It’s terrible!
Anxiety,fcneiox,t1_fcne8zh,1577810065.0,"Sheesh, I couldn’t stand that. It’s just terrible for people with PTSD and also animals as well, etc. it’s a beautiful thought but the sound is very ..loud... makes me want to run for the hills and just sit there until society has simmered down. But as for living in Chicago, no I don’t lol. I live in Alaska!"
BPD,fcneats,t3_ei2x4r,1577809924.0,So happy for you!🥰❤️
Anxiety,fcne79s,t3_ei4t1h,1577809859.0,We will see better days. Happy New Year! 🤗
BPD,fcn5q8j,t1_fcn535v,1577803974.0,"I admire that mentality! You’re completely right. I should be myself and be open about who I am and if you cannot handle that, then we don’t belong together. And if we don’t belong together, it isn’t the end of the world. It just simply isn’t and as I grow I’ll meet new people who accept me for me!

Thank you for giving me a peace of mind and helping me see a different side of it.

He already knows I’m “crazy” and “obsessive” and loves me for it. He actually puts up with me so well! Such a good guy. But like you said, if things don’t work out.. it surely isn’t the end of the world. Something I must remember. 

I will say this, I’m proud of whoever can deal with me because I am too much of myself actually. He’s got a big personality on his hands lol. 

Another thing, I get so insecure about telling people I’m BPD because my mom has always told me to keep it from people and that no one needs to know that I am and I shouldn’t label myself like that so that always made me worry too."
BPD,fcmx53o,t1_fcmmwtq,1577796194.0,"Thank you so much, lovely soul. You wishing I feel better soon makes me feel better in spirit. You’re the best. That’s very true, I have to remind myself that this too shall pass! Thank you for your advice ❤️😊"
Drugs,fc7ijyf,t1_fc7ey7q,1577508525.0,I’m just going to ignore this one.
Drugs,fc729bu,t1_fc723lv,1577495610.0,"Dude hell yeah, thank you so much! I’m going to look into the one with 8 testing kits. Such a good idea!"
Drugs,fc71r6a,t1_fc7180u,1577495228.0,"I never drink haha it makes me depressed but when I do, I will and it so happens that all my medications say “don’t use with alcohol”  so fuck it I guess. And that would be awesome to look into, very smart to do with the tester. That’s good they work with you on that. I was on Buspar but it didn’t do much for me. Wish it would have. But definitely is better than taking that much of the benzo’s. I definitely need to get one of those tests though, that honestly would make me feel so much better in all of this!"
Drugs,fc70lol,t1_fc65wtk,1577494346.0,"That’s so so true! We should vibe together whether or not we’re in the same stuff. Very true haha and we do honestly. We have such a beautiful relationship. Sometimes I just get sensitive and want us both to grow as individuals but we’ll get there, I got a few years ahead of him in time so I support him in what he does!"
BPD,fc70fa4,t3_egcoae,1577494212.0,Yes lol I observe and look so deeply into people that I know exactly what they would love!
Drugs,fc6zkin,t1_fc6z01p,1577493574.0,"You’re exactly right. It is just a pacifier. What has helped you otherwise? I’m on Prozac but sometimes I feel it makes me manic and once I come to my senses, I’m like why was i this intense this whole time? It sucks but trying to find the right medication. Going to get cognitive therapy soon. I’m hoping that will help and I’m so excited."
Drugs,fc6zfmz,t1_fc6yvqh,1577493475.0,"My doctors wouldn’t cut me off if they knew I was only having a drink or two, which they know and don’t see a problem unless I told them I was abusing it and blacking out, etc. You have to remember, it’s the lowest dose. You can barely feel it, it’s just to stop the racing thoughts going back and forth in your head that starts anxiety and sensory overload. 

That’s cool you do LSD for medical purposes. How it that going? And how do you test it? It would be cool micro dosing with psychedelics. I wish I could do that with him, just for that experience."
Drugs,fc6z3br,t1_fc5t7f1,1577493222.0,"That’s true, that’s how we do it. I am a very trippy person just being sober so when he’s on shrooms, we laugh and dance together and be little freaks in the night. It’s actually nice when he’s on them, I feel like he’s entered my world, in a way. 

But you’re right. He use to be an introvert type like me, but recently wanted to have a lot of fun. And I respect that. I’ve just have already experienced it. We’ll see how it goes, it’s his journey so I respect him in what he doe and support it. It’s his learning experience! Which is beautiful. I’ll just be in the background to care for him in the end with no negative judgment. And hopefully in the end he’ll write poetry with me on the beach lol."
Drugs,fc6ydq2,t1_fc5tbqr,1577492691.0,"You’re right. In the end, I just want us to both be healthy and not get too messed up. Getting cocaine off the streets is very scary. You never know what it’s cut with these days. I just want what’s best for him and his body. But he will choose what he will do at the end of the day, I just hope someday it’ll be what’s best, that’s all. I respect him in whatever he does though. That’s my homie sugar muffin. I just care for him deeply."
Drugs,fc6y6je,t1_fc6sou7,1577492539.0,"Xanax just helps my anxiety, it doesn’t get me high. And champagne isn’t that high in alcohol.

But in a way, you’re right. 

I wish I could completely stop it but when I need to take it in highly anxiety induced situations, I do. If not, I would end up having a panic attack and no one wants to deal with that constantly.. 

Do you know what it’s like having severe anxiety? Truly, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy."
Drugs,fc6xysw,t1_fc6efrv,1577492375.0,"I’m prescribed .5 mg of Xanax. I have severe anxiety issues. It comes straight from my doctors. I’m sorry if I triggered you in some way. But cocaine comes off of the streets, it can easily be laced with fentanyl, heroine, meth, anything. Which worries me, I just want the best for his safety and his body. 

Taking the lowest dose of Xanax helps me stay calm in certain situations. I don’t get high off of it and if I didn’t have to take it, I would stop in a heart beat. I only take it when I absolutely need to. But having this severe anxiety has taken over my life, I’m trying to get on the right daily medication so I can become more grounded. I’m at least trying to better myself for myself. 

I just want to grow in the best way as an individual. 

I’m not judging him, I just want us to grow together for the better."
Drugs,fc6xemt,t1_fc5tmyz,1577491962.0,"I take the lowest dose of Xanax for serve anxiety attacks. I am prescribed it so for a fact I know it’s not laced, etc. 

Cocaine doesn’t come straight from the doctors, it could easily be laced with something terrible which worries me."
Drugs,fc6x9ei,t1_fc6mqie,1577491856.0,"Exactly, I’m not judging him. I just want better for the both of us, to grow beautifully in health and not stay stuck taking key bumps forever all of our lives. He says he doesn’t want to anymore but sometimes he’ll bring it up and it just worries me. Thank you for understanding! I really appreciate it ❤️"
Drugs,fc6x3q3,t1_fc5twq3,1577491739.0,That’s very true! I like that idea. I just get scared if he gets too messed up but I guess in the end I’m there to take care of him!
Drugs,fc5i3gk,t1_fc5gz2r,1577458210.0,"So his brother does it quite often, it’s his twin brother that influences him to do this.. and they’re twin brothers so in a way if one does it, the other one wants to join. He’s very easily influenced even though every time he says “I don’t want to end up doing key bumps with my brother all night” but then he ends up getting too excited and will say fuck it and do it. We don’t go out often at all, so his finances are doing fine but it does get expensive and you’re right, he should just do adderall or something. I have a ton of it.. and like you said, longer lasting 100%. And exactly, I think it does stem from that bad boy Hollywood type when people start watching too much movies... he is 21 so it makes a little sense because the ego is nice and strong at that age. Which I completely understand I’m just hoping he’ll grow out of it. Just for health reasons and maturity is hot as fuck. I don’t find it attractive snorting lines or even saying you’re going to do coke. It just doesn’t interest me. But I have no room to talk because I’ll end up doing it too... easily influenced I guess as well but fuck I don’t want to! I just do because I don’t want to be around a bunch of people sniffing and talking too fast while I’m on my lil Xanax. It’s definitely not something he should be investing in haha hopefully hopefully he’ll mature out of this soon. I’m about to be 24 and I’m just ready to grow as an individual, work on investing in other things rather than drugs haha."
Drugs,fc5hc4b,t1_fc5gxlh,1577457607.0,"You’re right. It’ll be a New Year soon! And it would be nice to set some healthy boundaries, not only for us but for our health as well. I just think his nights would be better if he didn’t go so hard! I can only imagine what it does to his brain chemicals. I’m going to talk to him about it but he’s only 21... he’s got a lot of room to grow but maybe I’ll just add it in as a think about it because it’s not something I truly want to be around these days."
Drugs,fc5gpqz,t1_fc5ggrr,1577457109.0,"That’s true. If it doesn’t flow in all ways, I guess it just doesn’t flow. If that’s what he enjoys than he deserve someone who enjoys that same thing, you’re right. If I brought it up, I think he wouldn’t do it but I think that’s on his terms and his agreements with himself. We’ll see how things go!

Edit: it sucks too because he enjoys psychedelics but I’ve done them so much that it’s like, even from my first trip, I had the most intense experience.. I legit wasn’t the same ever again. On some occasions (most) I feel like I’m still on shrooms so that’s why I take Xanax sometimes. So for me, shrooms will make me go insane. It makes my brain go above and beyond. But it makes him feel silly and happy. Wish I could do them with him but I trip hard. Usually people want that experience but it makes me uncomfortable knowing too much truth about life. Ignorance is bliss. And it’s hard for me to accept the fact of what life really is so maybe I just need to work on myself. But mental illnesses run strong in my family and my brain deals with stress quite differently so I don’t know if I’ll be able to poison my brain with him mayne. It sucks cuz I want that experience but I know I couldn’t do it and enjoy it."
Drugs,fc5gkar,t1_fc5fn8c,1577456982.0,"That’s true, you’re right. I only take Xanax because I have severe anxiety, so with going out I get pretty bad sensory overload and start to evaluate everyone I’m around and think damn, society... quite the place. Although I can fit in, I just rather enjoy my human experience with deep emotional bonds instead of fast crazy experiences with those who obviously don’t care too much about your health if you’re doing cocaine. I mean these days you never know if it’s cut with anything too. It’s just dangerous man and I don’t have time for that. But I definitely don’t want to be a buzz kill. He deserve to live the journey his soul wants to take, I just wish there was a way to get around this or like magically want to be safer or something lol"
Drugs,fc5g9re,t1_fc5fokn,1577456740.0,"You’re right but like it’s also a vibe kill when someone wants you to not doing something, I feel like it’s his life and he should do whatever feels right to him but man it’s hard keeping up haha. He’s easily influenced by his friends too and they do that stuff, he’s also 2 years younger and I guess I grew up slightly faster than he did. I want to be that fun ride or die but I’m the type to sit by the ocean with someone and get deep and build a beautiful bond. He wants to live wildly and I respect that, it’s his journey and we get along so well with everything else I just want to know if there’s a way we can work something out."
