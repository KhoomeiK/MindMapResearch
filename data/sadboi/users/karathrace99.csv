First, I create a calendar event for the scheduled time. Then, I get the time in seconds between the current time and the calendar event (set as “TimeUntilText”).

I did some investigating and saw that the “Wait” command will only run 170 seconds in the background ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9i2wzt/psa_the_wait_function_doesnt_run_in_the/)). So, I calculated the number of seconds in 12 hours (43,200s) and divided that by 160s ([to be safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9i2wzt/psa_the_wait_function_doesnt_run_in_the/) ; it equals 270). Therefore, I set a loop to repeat that number of times (repeat 270). Within that repeat loop, I check if “TimeUntilText” > 0. If true, I wait 160s, then decrement 160 from “TimeUntilText”. The loop starts again, running 270 times. (Effectively, if “TimeUntilText” is less than or equal to 0 from the start, each pass will skip that if-sequence. So, there is some time wasted; it won’t be exact. But I decided I was OK with that to create an approximate timer of max about 12 hrs, provided this works.)

Then, after this repeat loop, I do an if-statement so if “TimeUntilText” is less than or equal to 0, the text is sent to the specified recipient.

Do you think this will work? (Thanks for brainstorming with me.)

As for *Outlander*, though— I Love *Outlander*. I was kind of surprised at how much I loved it. My Mom introduced it to me a few years ago; she doesn’t always have the best taste in TV shows/books/movies. (Not so good to the LGBTQ+s, the disabled characters, or the PoC’s oftentimes.) It’s really hit or miss, though, because sometimes the shows she STRONGLY suggests I watch are horrible, and sometimes they’re fantastic. 😆 *Outlander* reminded me that.

There is a lot of sex and there is some sexual violence. In my view, though, most if not all of it is there for a purpose (and I’m relatively critical about this). There’s one episode y’all may want to skip where the entire episode is an account of a lengthy, gruesome, graphic male on male rape of one of the main characters. It’s horrible. Surprisingly, though, it is not a bad episode — and that’s indicative of the rest of the show’s quality. As with the entire show, it takes great care with its characters, nuance, and depth. It actually deals with the short __and__ long-term consequences of this. Its main character, Claire, is a FANTASTIC female character. Its main male lead is actually great, too. There aren’t any lesbians yet that I know of, but it treats its gay characters with a ton of nuance. AND, it’s great historical fiction with awesome time travel/free will/almost Sci-fi fantasy shit woven in there. Like any show, it has its flawed moments. But 9.5/10, would recommend. It’s awesome. 😁"

Also who you love is a huge part of who you are, and Disney’s continuous denial of the romantic tones of Finn & Poe’s relationship for 3 movies denied a huge part of who they are/their stories — to the series’ detriment. And those choices were overtly politically motivated and not backed by the cast, writers, directors, or crew. I look forward to a day in which people’s sexualities aren’t “relevant” in the same political sense we think of them as being today. But, part of what makes people’s sexual preferences “relevant” now is the fact that certain people’s sexualities are punished, outright banned, or denied to extreme
measures in media and otherwise, and certain people’s “sexual preferences” are not. *Because* of the very fact their romance was not allowed to be made explicit for explicitly political reasons despite just about ALL the creatives involved rooting for that the entire time the series was going is why it’s relevant to talk about things like this. (Don’t love your comparing incest to being bi, btw, but that’s another conversation I guess. 😂)

They were heading that way with Susie this whole time and then during a set, Midge said in a throwaway line that she’d had sex with a girl in college (she, like Lenny Bruce was, is always very honest during her sets, so I have no reason to believe she was lying about that). Late season 2, they introduce Shy Baldwin, this incredible singer who asks Midge to open for him on tour. He’s expanded on all season. He’s closeted gay (pre-Stonewall), and late in the season, he comes out to Midge. (I won’t go into detail, but it’s an incredible scene in an incredible season.) It’s heavily implied, to the point where I’m willing nearly to call it explicit, that Shy and his manager, Reggie, have been in love for a long time. Reggie (and just about everyone) compare him and Shy to Midge and Susie all season. Susie’s definitely a main character and has had character-work including in the previous seasons, but even more so in this season (and I’m pretty confident it’ll be even more next season). In the season finale, Susie has this incredible scene with Joel, Midge’s ex-husband, where she admits she has a gambling problem and asks Joel to manage her money from now on. This is the first time we see her cry (this episode). 
***
She turns to go and he calls after her: 

Joel: Susie, stop. You can't just come in here like that. I mean, why? Why me? There's business managers and accountants and a lot of other people who are trained to do this. I mean, hell, Shy must have a team of people - you could ask to-

Susie (and she’s red-eyed this whole time): 'Cause you love her! You'll always be in love with her. You won't let anything bad happen to her, ever. It has to be you. Just let me tell her, okay?

Joel: What, that I'll love her forever?

Susie: No, about the money. She knows the other shit. Everybody does. I'm only gonna say this once, so pay attention — thank you.
***
This time. All these other times... They’ve been playing with the dynamics of Midge and Susie’s relationship all show. But then S3, everything got more real. The whole season was — even more — about feminism, free speech, identity, civil rights. It’s real now.

I don’t know exactly where they’re gonna go with any of it; I’m inclined to trust Amy Sherman-Palladino, who’s an excellent writer, and anyone she chooses to work with, so I have some hope. But there’s also that uncertainty, S4 won’t be back for a long time, and Amy’s been thwarted by dumbass network executives before, so I just— needed a palette cleanser. ❤️"

They say they refuse because my therapist — who I’ve been seeing for years, she took years for me to find, and was recommended by my primary care physician — is out of network and they “do not approve independent non-network therapist/psychiatrists.” Anymore. (This is a change, as of this year.)

Do not approve, with the money you stole from hundreds of people and used me to steal.

I hate these people. I wish I never had to talk to them again."
mentalhealth,fl85lb0,t1_fl830wu,1584916349.0,"I’m a young adult (20), and they control my life as an adult because I’m disabled. I’m trapped. This has been my nightmare for years. 

I can’t work outside the house, keep going to in-person college (everything, including my University, is shut down/online), or hardly leave the house because of Coronavirus. The house isn’t wheelchair accessible. I can’t earn enough money to pay for therapy through online jobs. When I was born disabled, these people started a foundation and named it after me to use me to extort/defraud people and pocket large sums of money for themselves. They’ve controlled my life via that and my parents’ relatively small/lack of income; they get to decide my care by being the only ones who can pay for it, using money they raised by using me to steal from people (most of which, again, they extort for themselves).

I’ve been trying to cut myself off from them and they’ve been trying to find a way to get back at me for going to college far away from them for years. I was in a major accident earlier this year. When I was badly injured, they finally saw their opportunity to get back at me for trying to get away from them, free myself from them, or stop them from using me any further. They’re still using me and extorting money from the foundation they built while using and abusing me.  They’re denying me treatment and saying they “don’t approve” of my therapist anymore. There’s a clear chain of events, here. This is their revenge."

(And if you haven’t been on a date with a girl, ever—I’m in that boat—bring up a girl you were crushing on in the same romantic context as the men others are discussing.)"
