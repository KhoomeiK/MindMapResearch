When using OBS you can create different scenes that can either record different outputs (ie PC screen capture, PS4, Xbox etc) or just display different layouts based on what games you‚Äôre playing or your preferences. Using those scenes you can add sources for overlays or audio tracks or whatever. Instead of adding a bunch of sources into one scene, create a new scene altogether and only add the text that you want displayed, and perhaps whatever source is capturing music so that your viewers aren‚Äôt just sitting in silence.

[Here‚Äôs what my scene *essentially* looks like](https://imgur.com/a/7G8Qgle) 

No need to add much more unless you feel like it. For example, for me, when streaming that scene, above where it says ‚ÄúStay Connected Be Right Back‚Äù I actually have a chat box that displays the current comments in chat.

As for inputting passwords, as long as you don‚Äôt have a source that is capturing what you‚Äôre doing, nothing will be seen on stream."

Not too sure about the armor, sorry. Question is a little confusing to me.

If you‚Äôre still trying to get the key molds (should be 4 separate objectives) then what you‚Äôll need to do is go to each forge (changes daily, so should take 4 days at the most) and after collecting the first set of 20 orb-things there will be a break before the next round. When the next round starts, there will be 2 drones that spawn in the forge. Find and kill them to get a ‚Äúbuff‚Äù.. should be called ‚ÄúMaximum Temper‚Äù. Then you just need to beat the boss at the end and a giant cube-ish black armory crate will spawn next to the forge and just collect it to get the key.

As for the Leviathan, that‚Äôs a bit of a loaded question. Would depend on which leviathan raid you‚Äôre talking about, but I‚Äôm always down to explain via party chat/discord or whatever. I main on PS4 but I cross play on Xbox and PC."
