SuicideWatch,fm6kq55,t1_fm6kl3f,1585796308.0,That’s good and me too.
SuicideWatch,fm6kh9i,t1_fm6jjcn,1585796142.0,"Also, I’m sorry to hear about your old friends putting you down. I hope you ditched them, even I would rather have no friends than “friends” who constantly make me feel bad."
SuicideWatch,fm6kcye,t1_fm6jjcn,1585796061.0,"Oml, I’m so happy someone like you found my post, I really never know what to expect when I post on here but it’s really the best feeling when I can find someone understanding. I’m so grateful you even bothered to respond. Though I’m not so sure about my parents being there for me, they’d probably just treat me like I was unstable if I opened up to them, but still I’m happy you call yourself my friend and I hope you don’t mind if I talk to you again sometime."
SuicideWatch,fm6j01z,t1_fm6gs1q,1585795158.0,"Oh, okay. Well to start, I’m 14 and I’m a freshman in high school and I’ve hit the lowest point in my life, but I guess that isn’t saying a lot considering I’m still young. I’ve lost all my friends, I don’t know how or why, but they all slowly began to ignore me and cancel plans to the point where I’m stuck hanging out in the school bathrooms everyday at lunch. It wasn’t so bad at first, i felt mostly embarrassed and odd. But the past couple months, since October, I’m desperate for friends or just someone to hang out with. I’ve tried joining clubs but I’m always the odd one out in them, everyone gets along so easily but I struggle so hard to get out a single sentence, and when I finally do I hate myself for opening my stupid mouth. My social life is nonexistent, and now my grades are suffering. I used to be a straight A student, but now when I go home, all I can get myself to do is go to bed and stare at the ceiling, the mere thought of going to school gives me anxiety (I’m so thankful for this quarantine, my school shut down due to it). 

As for what I said about my parents and feeling hopeless, they’ve been putting a lot of pressure on me recently to pick a career. No idea, whatsoever. My parents’ relationship is a bit unstable as well, and I’d say it’s at its worst right now, but thinking about it stresses me out and I’d rather not talk about it right now.

I just feel like almost everything that could go wrong, is going wrong. I know my problems sound like a teenage stereotype and extremely first world, and they probably are. I know so many other people my age, maybe even in my town, have it way worse than me, and that I’m lucky in comparison. But damn, they sure know how to hide it.

I really don’t know what I expect, it just feels like I’m suffocating and I didn’t know who to talk to. My parents aren’t good with things like this, they would tell me I’m just being dramatic (you might agree with them, it’s okay) and I don’t have any friends at all to talk to, so I just went to reddit to rant.

Sorry that was long, I just kept writing without thinking. But ty for listening."
SuicideWatch,fm6gpq5,t1_fm6g1gg,1585793670.0,"I would love if you could help me, I don’t know how you would do that though. But yes, I feel horrible, it’s like I’m stuck and I have no idea how I can feel better or how to just get out there."
SuicideWatch,fm6fx1v,t1_fm6ei68,1585793169.0,"Sure it’s fine, I just feel so hopeless. I don’t like my life, I just live telling myself that this is not all there is to life, one day I’ll have everything I want or at least be happy with what I have. But I don’t even know what I want, I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I don’t know what kind of person I want to be, and I feel so behind. I feel like everyone around me  knows what they’re doing or are at least at peace with what’s happening in their own lives. I really hate living at this point."
socialskills,flj4pug,t1_flixm2u,1585198842.0,"Yeah your right. I mean, you could ask one of your friends to help you practice? It’s kind of awkward lmao but do what u gotta do. Just keep practicing til it just become a habit to grab their hand when they put it out. Like maybe you can ask them to start just giving you random hand shakes until it becomes second nature."
CasualConversation,flirlcb,t3_fox03s,1585189039.0,"Same, I’ve been trying to wear jeans at least 3 times a week💀"
socialskills,flijsb8,t3_fp0ao9,1585184038.0,Maybe you could try putting ur hand out first? So then they’d have to be the ones to grab ur hand lol
CasualConversation,fkyjr6l,t1_fkwnqgq,1584650115.0,Definitely will sometime :)
CasualConversation,fkwg4f9,t1_fk6gw6f,1584591524.0,"I get what you mean, I think it’s a lot easier to think clearly when you see things from an outside perspective. Tyvm."
CasualConversation,fkwg0c6,t1_fk6lcdm,1584591436.0,"Yeah, you’re probably right. But I’m worried that if me and my siblings were to move out, and if they were the only two in the house during an argument, my dad might hurt her. And I don’t think my mom would say anything if he did. Or maybe they’ll be more at peace with us gone, but you’re right. I can’t help that I was born, and I can’t file a divorce for them. It’s their responsibility, not mine. Thank you."
CasualConversation,fkwfrft,t1_fk6y35l,1584591239.0,"I’m so grateful to have gotten such a nice and helpful response. What you said about it not being my responsibility really hit me, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I posted here. I felt desperate to rant to someone but I don’t have anyone to talk to, so this was my first post on here. This really helped me feel better, their relationship isn’t my responsibility. I don’t know you, but I really like you and I just wanted to say thank you."
funimation,fk5ruhs,t3_ex08zp,1583886658.0,"Guys, you can watch it on pornhub. That’s what I do anyways lmfao"
SuicideWatch,fjpu5c6,t3_f9d5go,1583560899.0,"Exactly how I feel. I wish I were just never born, or that I had died of cancer or something when I was really young. I don’t want to live anymore, but I don’t want to kill myself bc it would devastate my family. I just wanna get into a car crash or get murdered, just something uncontrollable. I contribute nothing to this world and I don’t enjoy life, I’m a waste of space and realistically, it doesn’t matter if I die. I wish I had no attachments to anyone, so that I could just end it without feeling bad for anyone else. Suicide is selfish and I know that, which is why I feel like shit for even thinking about it. But I’m just so tired of feeling embarrassed about everything I do and am, I’m sick of being bored and pitying myself."
lonely,fjcb5z5,t3_fcoepx,1583213840.0,"I lost all my friends over winter break. I don’t even know what happened, it’s not like we had any arguments or any fights leading up to it. They just completely forgot about me. I was the only one making an effort to reach out and start conversation. They’re responses were all dry and I was left on read a lot. I tried inviting them out a couple times, but they were always busy. Even when I asked a month in advance. I got sick for a week and I didn’t start any conversation the entire week, zero texts. It’s been 3 months since break, we’ve talked like 3 times. Over text every time, and I was always the one to text first. They didn’t bother to try to keep the conversation alive, and they’d leave me on read half way through. I’ve given up, I’m 14 and a freshman in highschool. I hide in the library at lunch, if the library is closed I hide in the bathrooms. I’m sad a lot, I think the only thing keeping me going is my family. My younger cousin went through a phase of not having friends either, she has friends now but they’re not very nice to her and she had to pretend to be someone else around them. Her words, not mine, but I’ve seen them talk before, and I can see what she means. I live my cousin, she’s the only one I can talk to about this other than my brother. I love my parents but they wouldn’t understand, they would tell me to just make friends and continue to nag me into making friends all year, so I don’t bother to talk to them about it. I just make up stories about how great my day at school was and make up excuses as to why my friends “can’t come over”. I just wanna stay home, and stay with my family. They’re the only people who care about me, if I died they’d be the only people at my funeral. I know that’s better than a lot of people have, but I still would like some friends who I’m not related to. But it’s ok, life is ok when I’m outside of school. I don’t have much to do in the weekend though, I love playing video games with my cousin and my brother though. Sorry this was just a rant lol"
lonely,fjcab3t,t3_fckz6x,1583213081.0,"Happy birthday :) I know it sucks to know you’re nobody’s first choice and never really on anybody’s mind. I’m going through it right now and have been for the past couple months, but it’s ok. It helps me to just know that everyone else on this thread is going through the same thing I am. You’re not alone, you’re just in the wrong place. Try going somewhere new where nobody’s knows you, and just be a new person. Be a new, open, extroverted person. I’m only 14 right now, so it’s not like I can really do that yet because I still live with my family. But once I’m in college, I’m gonna reinvent myself and be the type of person I admire. You should try it too, it’s your birthday, so why not go somewhere by yourself? Go to a bar you’ve never been to or something, and just meet some new people who know nothing about you, and just be the person you want to be. Or, maybe just go watch a movie by yourself, or somewhere with a nice view and listen to some music. I like doing those things when I feel bad about not having friends. It makes being alone seem a lot nicer. Anyways, I hope you have a good night. Eat some cake, or a donut if you don’t like cake. Happy birthday!"
