BipolarReddit,fneh09f,t3_g17q33,1586889211.0,I'm on paroxetine/olanzapine duo. After 10 years of trying different medication this mix seems to be the best option. I also take metformin for hunger control. Wish you luck!

newbrain,fjciobb,t3_fcpba2,1583221703.0,I have disordered thinking patterns and self-deprecating thoughts stop me from doing anything other than sleeping or browsing. CBT really helps. Whenever I'm procrastinating I write down automatic thoughts and change them to rational ones. I end up convincing myself to do the thing.
depressionregimens,fhmecau,t3_f3x275,1581711637.0,"Maybe suggest your psychiatrist to add metformin? It doesn't make you lose weight, but helps with hunger control. Metformin is used together with antipsychotics to prevent weight gain."

depressionregimens,fh8kjdl,t3_f1pz7u,1581361687.0,I take olanzapine. Metformin really helps with hunger. I gained 20 kg but now I'm on 1200 kcal diet and losing weight. Metformin made it possible.

BipolarReddit,esrrgv3,t3_c8yp97,1562234338.0,"I feel you. Two years ago my medication mix stopped working and I tumbled down in to upswings and downswings with mixed episodes in between. It was terrible. I destroyed almost everything I have worked for. When I finally stabilized I was left with fear and embarrassment, no job, scared and almost all alone. Fat, alcoholic, smoker and with scarred skin where I burned myself on purpose. Now it has been two months that I'm stable. Trying to fix everything little by little. I still have where to live, my husband didn't leave me and I already quit smoking. Everyday I tell myself - it's not my fault that illness happened. It's not my fault that medication stopped working. But what happens from now on is up to me. Bad things happen to good people for no reason, but it's up to us to make what's best out of it. Everything that happened until this moment, happened. We cannot change it. But future depends on us. Fix what can be fixed, come to terms with what cannot be undone. And work for better future. Stay strong and hope for best. Hugs."
