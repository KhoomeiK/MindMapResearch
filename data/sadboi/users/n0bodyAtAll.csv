I started running yesterday hoping I will alleviate my dizziness and lightheadedness but it didn't work out, it was the same. But I sadly don't even have the answer to it. It's actually kinda nice to see that I'm not alone here. Although, I think it is a vicious cycle. Maybe try doing something else and come back to workout some other time? 

The physical symptoms actually got worse and worse for me. I started training soccer again around august and at first I just kind of felt bad for some reason, then I had the upper right abdomen pain, and then I started getting random headaches and now I suffer from constant dizziness and lightheadedness. Also I didn't go for the ultrasounds or anything just because I actually feel okay despite all of the symptoms and it's probably anxiety, because I did ECG's and everything and it turned out to be tachycardia (basically pretty normal for me), did a shit ton of tests with the heart... Everything came back normal. That's why I don't even want to go for an MRI or shit like that."
Anxiety,fg19xys,t3_evyvsg,1580423423.0,"I've been going on with psychosomatic symptoms since October of 2019. 

It all started with mild headaches, then it turned into upper right abdomen pain, then it turned into constant dizziness and lightheadedness. I was also diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD and Hypochondria somewhere around December. That's why my doctor refrained from sending me to do pointless tests because the tests that were done before were in range of normal. The way I try to rationalize this is:  ""Well, I'm thinking I'm gonna die since October, and it's already going to be February. I still haven't died."" 

I was always thinking I had a brain tumor or leukemia or something like that, so you're not alone. I can't tell you how to fix it because I'm supposed to start therapy soon, but I guess you should start working if you don't have a job or something like that. 

Another thing that helped me to chill was watching Jordan Peterson's videos. Do anything that makes you relaxed, don't try to fight your anxiety, and for the love of god, do not google your symptoms. I can't tell you how many times I went to see my doctor and when I started to tell crap I was on about, even I thought it made no sense, but in some way it did."

So I went, waited for half a day, got hooked up on the machines, they took my blood and did all the fucking tests on me. Tests turned out to be normal, got some pills for lowering the frequency of the heartbeat and some xannies. They lowered my bpm from 133 to 88. 5 months later, I'm diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder, OCD, and Hypochondria.

croatia,esji7n5,t3_c7be87,1562033690.0,"Moje iskustvo:


Igrao sam standalone (doduše cracked) od 0.59 na dalje. Zadnji update je 1.04 (igra je napokon izašla iz alphe i eto...), engine je reworked, npr nekad je jump bio bound na ""V"", sada je automatski bound na space, više nije toggle da ulaziš u combat mode nego držiš desni klik pa udaraš lijevim, ovo je malo sad već detaljno al jbg.
Promijenjen je cijeli sistem craftanja itema, reloadanja gunova, punjenja samih magova, dodan je stamina bar na kojeg utječe koliko stvari nosiš na sebi, etc. etc. etc.
Zeds u ovome najnovijem updateu mogu nosit gear sa sobom (ubiš zed, dobiješ backpack ago ga nosi) i tako dalje.

Što se tiće performancea, po čemu je DayZ poznat, ne samo SA (standalone) već i mod, u updateovima nakon alphe, igra je raj na zemlji u odnosu na updateove prije.

No sada ozbiljno: nema do originalnog Arma 2 DayZ Moda, ne pričam o Epoch i Overpoch (to je za pi*ke), nego pričam o Vanilla modu. Ako si u prilici, kupi Arma 2 Combined Operations i skini mod, iako je igra mrtva. Ostavit će jako dobru impresiju na tebe ako te zanima DayZ, po mojem mišljenju najbolja survival igra ikad, iako je engine gritty as fuck i neoptimiziran. Ako si nabaviš ekipu, ta igra: sati i sati zabave."
