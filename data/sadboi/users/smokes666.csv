crossfit,fqc7uel,t3_ghv3mz,1589251953.0,CrossFit milestones and physical milestones are so fun! Congrats !
Daylio,fq57opw,t3_ggpr84,1589095260.0,Me too. I just want to work so I can make some cash. Everyone is rolling in dough and my unemployment is MIA because they couldn‚Äôt confirm my identity. I already lived pay check to pay check. I just sit here every day wondering what I‚Äôm going to do. I have no spouse or roommate or fall back. I try to be patient but I already struggled with extremely poor mental health. Hopefully you get to resume life soon. Hang in there.

TrueOffMyChest,fpm9fi9,t1_fpka061,1588728271.0,No no you are 1000% justified and entitled to your opinion. If anything I want to say thank you for expressing it because I have a hard time doing so myself. Additionally it‚Äôs nice to know that someone understands what I‚Äôm going through because I feel like my friends don‚Äôt get it. They want to be there for me but they don‚Äôt really understand why the lack of closure is confusing for me.
TrueOffMyChest,fpjd6jb,t3_gdod0b,1588664248.0,I could not agree more. I haven‚Äôt seen or heard from my husband in over 2 years. I just don‚Äôt get it either. I wanted to let you know that you do matter and you are valuable! Easier said than done but don‚Äôt place your worth on one persons immature decisions. You will make genuine friends.

Advice,et9ka5e,t3_cam417,1562598955.0,Let me preface. I was married for 3 years. I found out my husband had several kids behind my back. He disappeared one night. I knew where he went. I served him 5 times as he claimed my divorce would end his life. I did time. I am now single and I live alone. Getting my job back was really hard. I do not have paid time off. To do my hours I have to take two days off of work which costs me an upwards of $400. Which means I can‚Äôt pay rent. It is a lot more important to me to pay bills that help me live. Not to lose time from work because I tried to get away from my husband. You cannot change my mind with your sob stories about fear of law enforcement. Rather take a $100 hit and buy my hours.
Advice,et9jzwh,t1_et9j9nm,1562598760.0,You are wrong but thanks. Try calling and asking for community service when you have a rap sheet. You get turned down for mostly everything. I‚Äôm buying my hours. Thanks though.
