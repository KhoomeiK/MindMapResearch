Which can be when you have genitals that are hard to tell which sex they may belong to or when someone has a different chromosome makeup than the binary.

One of the monks said he would get panic attacks and “made it his friend” eventually just acknowledging it, accepting it as something that is happening, and working through it. 

It’s okay to be angry. Emotions and feelings are something that everyone experiences and they’re all useful. Anger is expected to happen. Especially if you had trauma or a bad childhood (I’m also trying to work through mine and my anger that comes along with it) I think the first step is to let yourself feel angry. I admire that you’re trying to reduce your anger, I feel similarly. I’m sorry I can’t be much more help, but you’ll get there."

I met with a professor to ask for a recommendation letter for grad school. She not only agreed to write one, but complimented me in ways I never would have thought. She said she was going to do everything in her power to help get me placed into the master’s program at my university because she thinks our field needs more naturally empathetic, resilient practitioners like me. I went to the dentist for the first time in 2 years (anxiety and bad gag reflex) and they were really accommodating. A girl reached out to me to tell me she’s inspired by how open I am about mental health. My boyfriend and his dad were talking about us trying a long distance relationship. I guess his father told him I’m too special not to be in his life. 

People appreciated me all day. For the first time in a long time, I feel very loved."
