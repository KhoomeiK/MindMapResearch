My personal takeaway, which could be wrong as I am no expert, is that Putin's kremlin is desperately trying to play both sides of the game. Like, the economic impacts are already noticable and awful here in Petersburg, but at the same time we obviously have a pandemic on our hands. Kremlin desperately wants to open the economy so money can flow again, but it also recognizes that covid will fuck these plans up. So Kremlin has been relying on regional governors to handle the situation while shirking as much federal responsibility as possible. There are rumours theyll extend the lockdown till June now but without a state of emergency, the already dire social circumstances here will get much worse. 

Back to point, from the inside, the moscow mayor seems to be the only federal appointee who really tales this shit seriously (whether he is doing a good job, I dont comment on), but i doubt he'll be falling out of any windows. Hes keeping the capital together for now. I'm more interested in Putin's lifetime president referendum."

Apparently you think humans normally base their decisions on stat websites rather than personal experience. But your disconnect with reality has been pretty clear from the start.
2. If the only language you speak is one of stats, how about we compare some of the biggest cities from the US and Russia by homicide rates. Of 100,000, Moscow has a homicide rate of 2.3, Petersburg 3.3. By my count there are 82 US cities with higher homicide rates than that (counting only those included in the wiki page listing US cities by crime rate). Comparing the biggest cities - New York is a little higher than Petersburg with 3.39, LA is 7.01, Chicago is 24.3, Houston 11.5. Sounds like most of what you've heard about russia is from the 90s when things were really bad. Things have changed a hell of a lot in the major centers.
3. Of course if you try to boil the entire country down into one thing, Russia still looks like hell. I've never said the whole country is a paradise or a great place to live. I just like Petersburg and Moscow. If you dont believe me, you can look up all the stats you want - these are modern european cities with good services, a healthy young generation (life expectancy stats are slow to catch up with changing health). Of course I'm not saying it's perfect. Of course I'm not saying it's better than NZ or many other countries.

My girlfriend and I are keeping a close eye on things and agree that we'll move back to NZ together if things get tough. But that's a worst case scenario. As much as people love the idea that Russia is a trashy filthhole that is constantly on the verge of collapse, life still goes on, and it's very likely life will still continue to go on after this. 

Yes, I'm afraid to go out at night right now. 

I can tell you tons of places in NZ where I'm also afraid to go out at night, many parts of Auckland, one of the highest life quality cities in the world, among them.

Blink twice if I need help?  God you sound like a right twat"

Oh wait, no, that's just fucking stupid. Shouldn't surprise me from someone still using ""top kek"". It's the twenties dude. The time to be an edgy teen was over ten years ago."

worldnews,fogcmxm,t1_fog2rwi,1587750864.0,"That was a thing in the 90s. Russia isnt in the 90s any more. Russian girls are helluva lot pickier these days, as my colleagues who come here looking for hot russian tail find out to their dismay. 

Keep in mind I'm talking about the main cities here, not the rest of the country which is pretty much forgotten about. But still, been here 6 years and it's definitely not as fucked up as you think. Not great. Not terrible. I'd rate it 3.6"

worldnews,fo6een7,t1_fo6a4x9,1587556379.0,"While this is definitely true, its also important to be aware of the danger of attributing every geopolitical and social problem to Russia. Doing so can even benefit Russia, if it means voters are spending more time focusing their attacks on Russia than on the systemic problems inherent in their own system. I think of it this way, Russia is an exacerbator, not a causer. 

To be clear, as someone who's lived in in Russia for many years and is quite integrated here, the world absolutely could and should do more to curb Russian interference and taking advantage of instabilities and weaknesses in their system. But that solution comes as much from internal change as it does from punishing or defending against Russia."

worldnews,fnbfi1r,t1_fn8nr61,1586814618.0,"The only thing I dont really get, if those January-February cases were actually coronavirus, is why it took this long for it to suddenly swell into this crazy situation we have now. If our hypothesis is true, it means the rapid rise in cases is completely down to testing numbers, and deaths were not counted as covid but simply flu. It just seems a bit unreal that the worlds health organisation could have missed something that huge. 

Still, not everything really adds up here, whichever way we look at it. I agree, I'd love to get some antibody tests done. I suppose we'll understand it better on the other side."
worldnews,fn8j292,t1_fn82xrx,1586742786.0,"The regions of russia are pretty autonomous, much like the states, I imagine, maybe even more so. That's why every region here has different measures - in Leningradsky Oblast (around and outside Petersburg) the measures are much stricter than in the city, for example. Still, ""pushing towards a normal work schedule"" on it's own doesnt mean much. The month long lockdown is still in force and could be extended. We are all quarantined here in Petersburg and have been for weeks. This is my 3rd week working from home.

Where the Kremlin has failed entirely is economic support, rather than actual covid measures. The borders closed and lockdown happened basically same time as most other places, but businesses and workers are on their own, and crime has definitely increased."
