They lack the cognitive functions to speak, think rationally, or behave like they were before they became feral ghouls so I doubt that they are able to engage in intercourse. Radiation makes you sterile, in women a single dose of 1â€“2 Gray will cause temporary damage and suppress [menstrua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation) for periods up to 3 years; a dose of 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility. In men,  A dose of 0.1 Gray will cause low sperm counts for up to a year; 2.5 Gray will cause sterility for 2 to 3 years or more. 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility.  In the Fallout universe, ghouls and feral ghouls are shown to be far more irradiated than is possible for a normal and healthy human being to survive. Taking this information into consideration, feral ghouls lacking in cognitive functions and being sterile would not be able to reproduce while ghouls despite variations in cognitive function and intelligence, would also be sterile and therefore not able to reproduce despite being able to engage in intercourse."
