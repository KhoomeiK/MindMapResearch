SuicideWatch,fqirqda,t1_fqiph1k,1589399979.0,Anytime! Sometimes it helps to talk to someone else so you can vent how the conversation made you feel. That way you can clean your system before going back into the front lines again. It's very emotionally draining to help someone. You're very welcome! Feel free to message me if you need to.
SuicideWatch,fqiohc5,t3_gizqix,1589398734.0,"Sometimes my friend calls me in suicidal moments. He's got schizophrenia and PTSD and lives in a completely different state. He sometimes goes off his meds and I get calls late at night. I try to hear him out, and even if he lashes out at me, I simply and calmly say ""I still love you"". If you manage to get her to talk, don't interrupt, just affirm you're listening and wait for when it's appropriate to speak. Sometimes that takes awhile. When the situation comes into view better, you'll have a clearer understanding, but stay neutral and sympathetic. For my friend, I have to remind him that what he's feeling isn't really his fault. I usually add in that the situation he was put in wasn't his fault and that any reaction he had was entirely understandable. Don't guilt trip or make light of anything. The important thing is to stay completely calm and supportive of their right to be sad and messed up. If you get emotional, it makes people feel like they're inconveniencing or bothering you with their problems. I generally stay away from ""it'll all turn out alright"" or ""it'll be okay"". That's probably not what she wants to hear, she needs to be heard.   
You might want to start having a scheduled ""date"" each week on the same day to give her something to look forward to and a sense of connection. Meet up on the computer, just to have a chat, maybe eat a meal together via computer screen. One thing I've done is had a movie night with a friend in another state by us both on the computer and hitting the ""play"" button at the same time on the TV.    
I might also mention I've got Asperger's and occasionally feel suicidal too, so my ability to stay calm might be easier said than done for others. I really hope this helps!"

It sounds terrible, but just wait and see. Try to find things to look forward to, like a movie or new episodes of a show you like.

This is a great place to vent."
SuicideWatch,fqbk4c1,t3_ghjgnt,1589238477.0,"The hardest part for me was when I was having these thoughts a few years ago and confided in my mom. She decided to tell everyone about it and then people thought I was just trying to get attention. Some even made fun of me for it. I've stopped talking to her about it. (35 F, but started feeling this way in 3rd grade.) My mom is bipolar (usually in manic phase because of medications), my dad is an alcoholic, and my brother is a bully and narcissist. I'm really surprised I made it this far.  
Please cherish your dad and hold onto him. I think he would constantly wonder if there was more he could do to save you if you went through with it. It would eat him up inside."
