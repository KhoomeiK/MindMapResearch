Both fields have their pros and cons, some things to consider is having multiple patients at the same time so almost never any 1 on 1s anymore, and the usual administration that runs you as hard and efficiently as possible, being given orders by drs for medication to the point where you can't even do as much patient care as you want since you'll feel like a robot punching documentation and giving meds out as fast as possible. I agree our field isn't perfect as everyone knows. What are your current biggest complaints with being a PT?"

Even just sitting with correct posture for more than 5 min will feel like a workout for most people.
