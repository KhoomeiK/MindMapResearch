So, you're already ahead of the game. If you don't have friends, are there cousins or family members you can hang with when this quarantine is over?

Never give up. NEVER. Things are better now than they were 1,5 years ago. What if things get even better 1.5 years from now? This is a bad time. Everything is on hold. So, don't be so hard on yourself. One step at a time. Be the best worker at your job. Don't try to be perfect, just the best you can be on that particular day. If you can't be your best some days, just be okay. You want to create momentum so good things keep happening. Teach yourself how to play a musical instrument. Maybe the guitar or harmonica. Read up on some history or a subject that interests you and become an expert on that subject. Keep your mind occupied with something creative. You want positivity to crowd out the negativity.

I think she is acting out of fear that you are moving soon. In some instances, the parent, child and sometimes both are subconsciously bracing themselves for the separation. Your mom may be thinking she's handling things well even though she isn't. Expecting you to spend all of your time with her is evidence that she's not. Lashing out and breaking your laptop proves that she is having a hard time coping. She seems to be struggling with her emotions.Though your mother provoked this incident, it's common for parents and kids to argue and lash out at one another as the moving day gets nearer. We've all heard of empty nest syndrome. It's not just the obvious; having an empty house when the kids leave. There can actually be a period that's comparable to grieving. Some mothers go through a mourning period. The old relationship dynamic must die in order to make way for the new one. Your mom will adapt. Best of luck!"

Sometimes the images morph into others like some dark, twisted, even weirder series of Picasso paintings. I can't even explain some of them because they are so twisted.

I often wonder if anyone else experiences this but I have never asked or discussed it with anyone. So, thank you for letting me know I'm not the only one. My take on it is that I have a very active imagination. I think it's probably like the people who write horror novels or make those Saw movies. People think of these things even though they wouldn't actually do any of them in real life. A thought is a thought, whether good or bad. Take for example, we imagine kissing our married teacher. It's a thought. We know we would never actually do it and so it's a nonissue. Same with weird or violent thoughts. We recognize them as strange. We know the difference between fantasy and reality.
