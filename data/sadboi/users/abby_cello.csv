It's where you work for a short interval of time and then take a break for a shorter interval, then repeat the process again and again. Try to work for no more than 20 minutes at a time, because that's how long the brain is able to concentrate before getting tired. This is a great way to get a lot of work done while still letting your brain recharge like it needs to! 

A great app to practice the Pomodoro method is Forest. For each work interval you go without checking your phone, you get a cute little virtual tree planted in the app!"

Anxiety,fne9hp4,t3_fw3y20,1586885404.0,"I have GAD too, but even though some careers might be more difficult for us initially,  that diagnosis should not be a reason to not pursue them! If you really love a field and are interested in a certain career there, you should go for it. Your love for the field might end up beating your anxious tendencies. And being brave enough to do that will make you stronger and show that you can really do whatever you set your mind to! Of course it will be harder to be successful in one of these careers than it would be for someone without your anxieties, but you will also be stronger than them in the end.

And for most fields, I think that there are diverse options, some of which might be easier than other options in the same field. Teaching is one example I can relate to with this. I'm a music student in graduate school. Most people in the music field will go into public teaching because there's more job options there than there are in the performance area. I picked the music performance major though because of my anxieties about controlling and speaking in front of a large group of kids. However, since then I have started teaching private cello lessons, which are one on one. I've found that this is great for me because it lets me be a mentor without the stress of a large group! And while there is still anxiety, especially with new students, this job has made me more confident socially and more skilled musically!

I hope this makes sense. Overall I would say not to discount a career just because you or someone else says you couldn't do it because of your mental obstacles. Trying something scary will help you grow. This is NOT to say that you should keep trying to put yourself through something that is actively hurting you! If you try something for a while and it really never gets better, and there's nothing you can do to help your situation, then stop! But you can have more confidence in your abilities. ❤"
