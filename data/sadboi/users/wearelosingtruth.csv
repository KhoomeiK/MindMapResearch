√9=x 

√3²=x

x=√3²

x=|-3| or |3|

x=3 

Btw |x| always gives absolutely value of x, it never gives you negative values so saying |x| will result into a negative number is bullshit."

Advice,fpcfnuj,t3_gc4jfl,1588498810.0,"Well,same thing was happening with me few weeks back and I think I  took some  control over it by now. I started by taking microsteps. 
I'd suggest you to-

--> take a sheet of paper and note down all the tasks you think you can do in a day.

--> Make  time table daily,  keep it simple &   try  to follow it.  Include exercises in it and other important stuffs to keep yourself busy so you can avoid procrastination. It sure is difficult at first but it gives you focus. 

--> start with your favorite subject. 

--> take short breaks in between.

 Listen to music if the disturbing thoughts can't go  away from ya head. 

By keeping yourself busy you can avoid procrastinating you can keep yaself busy and you'd avoid excessive masturbation.

Also. I'd suggest you to not blame your masturbation for all the things happening with you right now. If masturbation is done in a right way (not in a addicted manner) it would  def give you a calm and feeling of relax and  you won't regret a shit that you did it."
