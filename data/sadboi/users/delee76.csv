He purposely had the paperwork sent to my old address. I didn’t know to show up anywhere to fight so I lost by default. For me to refile would be hundreds of dollars I don’t have. 
I’m in the USA, in Alabama. I have not seen my son since he was 9 and he is 16 now. The pain is indescribable for me and I worry he thinks I don’t love him. My ex made it where I can’t even call. Not a restraining order but I forget what it’s called.
No I’m not crazy, don’t drink, nor do drugs. I’m just poor. For example, I can’t drive due to my vision and his attorney spun it where “she doesn’t own a car” making me look irresponsible. He took advantage of my vulnerability and the fact that my family doesn’t believe in helping. One is supposed to get oneself out of ones own mess.

I grew up upper middle class and my ex was a PhD engineer. After the divorce I lost my way of life as I knew it and lived ten years of poverty, hunger, and desperation. I lived in shelters, could not treat my illnesses leading to the disability, saw poverty in a way I never knew exiting this country.
I’m married now and we have a son. Still poor but at least it’s a little better. During that ten year period I quickly found out who loved me and who didn’t, and what it means to be poor in this country."

mentalhealth,fp9127b,t3_gc2xrx,1588410230.0,"I feel similarly. I didn’t grow up with my mother and secretly craved her attention. Later in life she started a dog charity, then a transport business that became extemely profitable. 
Without going into too much I feel that she values those dogs more than me. One time I could go on a family vacation because there wasn’t room in the can for me because of the dogs. I’m visually impaired and can’t drive and poor so I couldn’t fly.
Anyway let’s just say I’m not a dog person but I do have a cat.
As for the killing of any animal, I am mostly vegetarian. I grew up with my dad and grandmother and they didn’t eat a lot of meat. My dad later because vegetarian. I never developed a taste for meat and the texture mostly repulses me.
My mother never ate a lot of meat either for the same reason and as her love of animals grew she became very conscious that if she ate meat that the animal laid down it’s life for her and we should respect that.
I held onto that belief myself. I may eat a little fried chicken twice a month.
Don’t let other people’s opinions make you feel wrong or doubt yourself. Everyone is different and this whole “raising a dog like another person” has gone way too far!"
