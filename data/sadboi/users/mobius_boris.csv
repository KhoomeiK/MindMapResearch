i know id slip into another if someone pushed for it.  i know i‚Äôd let it happen because i‚Äôm an unhealthy people pleaser. 

the only good thing coming from that experience is that i‚Äôm actually comfortable with being single and working on myself, as opposed to before the relationship, where i believed myself to have no issues and was second guessing whether i was ever worthy of external love, and whether i‚Äôd ever find it.

BPD,fa87fqh,t3_caprto,1575842186.0,"that last comment got me, where you‚Äôre <<doomed to go from friends group to friend group>> 

 along the years i have been in a constant cycle of meeting others and having a problem with one or two of the people in a group and then BAM i‚Äôm back to being alone again. 

BUT one thing that does annoy me the most is how people can be blatantly(or seemingly blatantly) disrepespectful 
to you, but when you decide to do something about it, everyone makes you feel crazy and overreactive. it makes me feel like i have no idea what‚Äôs going on EVER and i‚Äôm losing so much patience over it."

schizophrenia,f9ia723,t3_e4yaa5,1575332043.0,"half the time.  i walk down the street and everyone‚Äôs looking boring and normal, but here i am twirling instead of turning, picking up caterpillars at intersections, staring into blank space and smiling. 

other days, the <outside> is a minefield in which i have no business walking about"
