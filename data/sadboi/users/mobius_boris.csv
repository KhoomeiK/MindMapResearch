i know id slip into another if someone pushed for it.  i know i’d let it happen because i’m an unhealthy people pleaser. 

the only good thing coming from that experience is that i’m actually comfortable with being single and working on myself, as opposed to before the relationship, where i believed myself to have no issues and was second guessing whether i was ever worthy of external love, and whether i’d ever find it.

OCD,fai4w6q,t3_e9aof6,1576099901.0,"i was talking to my mum about adhd and OCD ticks and she tells me i definitely don’t have OCD  or else i’d be worried about keeping my pet’s cages clean and always cleaning my room. 

she’s such a hypocrite bc she tells me she’s super interested in medical stuff, but the second i tell her to learn about mental health, she asks, “why?”"

BPD,fa87fqh,t3_caprto,1575842186.0,"that last comment got me, where you’re <<doomed to go from friends group to friend group>> 

 along the years i have been in a constant cycle of meeting others and having a problem with one or two of the people in a group and then BAM i’m back to being alone again. 

BUT one thing that does annoy me the most is how people can be blatantly(or seemingly blatantly) disrepespectful 
to you, but when you decide to do something about it, everyone makes you feel crazy and overreactive. it makes me feel like i have no idea what’s going on EVER and i’m losing so much patience over it."

i was sitting on the couch and looking at my legs. i couldn’t process the fact that those were MY legs. it felt like they belonged to a different person."
schizophrenia,f9ia723,t3_e4yaa5,1575332043.0,"half the time.  i walk down the street and everyone’s looking boring and normal, but here i am twirling instead of turning, picking up caterpillars at intersections, staring into blank space and smiling. 

other days, the <outside> is a minefield in which i have no business walking about"
