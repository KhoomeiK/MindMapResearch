JUSTNOMIL,fp4wqhw,t1_fp4vtwn,1588309415.0,I wouldn't say this is an indication that they are investigating further. When my son's teacher called CPS due to a bruise he had from a baseball tournament the weekend before. They looked at our home and requested the same with the doctor. She explained that when they get a call about possible physical abuse they will seek out the kids doctor every time. So hopefully this is the same situation here.
