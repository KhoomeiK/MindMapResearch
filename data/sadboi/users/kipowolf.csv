BPD,fqa3r6r,t1_fq95yz0,1589212291.0,Exactly me.
BPD,fqa3o7s,t1_fq8wxzi,1589212249.0,It’s my biggest fear too that nobody will ever really understand because I can’t put it into words. So everyone assumes I’m being dramatic and inflating the situation because I can’t give them a clear definition of how I feel; the only thing I’m positive about is that it’s really really bad.
BPD,fn7d0qb,t1_fn6w7vj,1586717915.0,You are not alone. This is me to a T
BPD,ffj4jv6,t1_fffz0im,1579990216.0,Ughh yeah exactly. It’s nice to not be alone though. I hope things only get better for you <3
BPD,fffo776,t1_fffe5e3,1579888183.0,This is exactly what I experience. I know I can be  hard to deal with on a daily basis but I also know my love is extraordinary and sincere. I begin to fear the person I’m loving knows this too and is using me for their own benefit. To stroke their ego and use me as someone to blame when fights break out. I don’t trust people because I think everyone else is so arrogant ... DAE
