explainlikeimfive,fglja6g,t3_eyq9v1,1580900599.0,"Fake. Saddly, a lot of scenes are staged.
They lay out carcasses and pretend a pack of wolf's just killed a deer. 
They hide sweets inside a carcass and use a trained, tame bear that will rip it apart, trying to get to the reward, meanwhile it looks like he's viciously devouring his prey.
Drugged animals might also be a thing, but tame animals and a lot of staged situations actually filmed in Zoo's or Terrariums are just the confirmed things I heard  in different documentaries about how they actually film it.
It's necessary, but sometimes it goes over the top imo.
They also do a ton of dramatic scene cutting and show scenes that have nothing to do with the story of ""the lion that fights for his role in the pack"" (for example), they will just cut in a scene were one lion roared and make it seem like he roared at another lion to show dominance but in reality that lion was somewhere alone.
Zoom-inned scenes are a good indicator.
On the other hand I love this stuff, and there's still the cameramen/photographers waiting days or weeks inside a small hideout to get that _one shot_ .

The king was dependent on the nobility liking him, as much as the nobility tried to be liked by the king.

For example, French king Ludwig XIV die build a giant expensive castle, castle Versailles not only as living residence and center of power, but also to provide space to live for his noble-men, which were hundreds I think.

The game of power was between nobility, who managed to get a room closest to that of the king, constantly changing.

So in a sense the king had all the power. But he didn't. He had to care for his people of nobility, because they were essentially doing all the work, governmental administration, collecting taxes, contracts, laws, build streets, all that annoying but important stuff.
Much like a government today foes, and usually has a big building for this purpose like a Parlament.

I understand kings more as ""superstars for the public"" than imperators with solo power.
They were the governmental face for the common people.
Much like today, presidents or chancellors themselves don't hold any real power, but instead are ruling over the politicians, who, rule over the people.

Army might be one big part of power, but there are more branches that you need control over, to govern.

- this comment reflects more my impression, than historical facts. I recommend Netflix ""the Roman empire"" series. It's highly overdramatic and infotainment, but it can give you a rough impression of how complex power play in ancient Rome of who would be the next emperor."
