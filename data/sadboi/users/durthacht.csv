But one had a sorrow that never was said  
And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear,  
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.

So softly she came that her feet made no din

His is a really interesting story. He became disillusioned with football in England mostly because of the people involved and the attitudes of young professional footballers, rather than hating football itself. 

So he returned to Ireland and took up Gaelic football. Eventually, Supple set up a goalkeeping academy which re-kindled his love of football and he played for Bohemians in the League of Ireland, where he won an award as the best goalkeeper in the league. He retired due to injury and is now a successful businessman. He is a fascinating character and full of integrity.

They were lied to, and people foolishly believed it. 

Also, I think Europe pretty much has addressed most of the British concerns. They no longer talk about ever closer union and are focused on enlargement, which is what the UK always wanted. 

Finally, just about every credible opinion poll now shows that the public has changed their minds with strong majorities for remain. But they likely won't get a chance to vote on the actual deal instead of the lies sold in 2016, because of vested interests."

Depression is the leading disability in the world, is highly complex, and the experience is different for everybody.
