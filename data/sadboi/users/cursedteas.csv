ChronicPain,fpd4bb8,t3_gciai7,1588519547.0,This always makes me so frustrated - people will never understand chronic pain till it happens to them!
AskReddit,fo1vais,t1_fo1bbry,1587442295.0,"I've been in this exact situation. They never asked me ""how are you"", it was always only me who cared about them. Then I got sick with severe chronic illnesses, forcing me to become bedridden for quite some time. They never even knew. I'm still very ill and can barely manage day-to-day. It's now coming up on 1 year without any contact with my former friends. 

I may have no friends, but at least I don't have to deal with the selfishness of them ever again."

AskReddit,fjroq64,t3_felx7s,1583588285.0,A presenter on a morning tv show was speaking about how Reddit was the most popular social media platform. Everyone on the panel agreed that they had never heard of it before. This made me curious to understand the popularity of the app. The rest was history!

SuicideWatch,fhp31f5,t3_f42zm2,1581780899.0,"I feel the same way. Today I went to a restaurant to try to get out of a depressive episode. As I was leaving, I walked into an ex-friend of mine who was all dressed up and going on a date. I feel like absolute shit that I'm just trying to get my life on track and other people like her can just date around with ease. Life feels so unfair."
