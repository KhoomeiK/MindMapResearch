overcoming,fqprr69,t1_fqp3dd1,1589552746.0,"Self-sabotage is something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. One of the things that I am most curious about is why it happens. It seems really counterintuitive to me that a person can stand in their own way, and that they can ruin things that they strongly care about. I wish I had a lot to say about this issue. I'm not sure that I do. 

The best things I've read on this subject say that a person is not a single thing — a person isn't made up of a single personality that has a single vision for its life. Most people are actually a messy amalgamation of sub-personalties, conflicting desires, ideas that they got from elsewhere, beliefs about social judgement, the critical voice of their parents, traditional expectations etc. A person is a really messy combination of many things that can't always fuse together in a healthy way.

Maybe that's part of the reason why we're able to stand in our own way. There are all these conflicting motivations that we can't quite resolve. So, part of us says ""we need more friends, we need to connect more deeply with others"" but then another part steps in and says ""well, actually, people are only going betray you and you need to stay away from them"". It's impossible to go above and beyond that. It's hard to reconcile those two thoughts. Now, imagine if you had 15 different conflicting ideas! What a nightmare. 

I also think that self-sabotage in relationships and friendships has a lot to do with self-respect. It's hard to let someone into your life and soul if you don't believe that you're fundamentally deserving of respect and compassion. It's very hard to be a good friend to another person if you're unable to respect and have compassion for yourself. 

As you say, self-sabotage is ruinous but it can also be a sign that a person has some unfinished work within themselves. I find that the best way to overcome the urge to sabotage myself is to do an analysis of the parts of me that are in conflict with each other, and to try to find a way to either pick a side between them, or to transcend the conflict altogether. 

It also helps when a person isn't being too hard on themselves."

overcoming,fq9hbnr,t3_gh32dr,1589198245.0,"Friendships are hard, right? I feel that there's sometimes a huge contrast between the way we imagine friendships should be and the way they actually are. Ideally, they would be nothing more or less than the joyous connections we see in movies and tv shows.

But they get messy and complicated. People change. People aren't always willing to put in the work. People grow in different directions. We discover our own identities and quickly realise that they aren't exactly compatible with the friend groups we've had for years. Circumstances change. Life gets in the way. Some lie. Some hurt us too deeply. Some mistakes cannot be forgiven. Some people just grow tired of the friendships for no apparent reason. People move. People grow old. People die. Some people use you for their own gain. Some people become boring. Others are narcissistic from the start.

But some friendships work. And they work really well. Every so often there's a perfect alignment. A window opens and presents us with an opportunity to forge a deep connection with someone else in spite of the many pitfalls and obstacles. I think that friendships are a really dynamic thing that require a lot more effort than is made apparent in tv shows and movies. Sure, they can be lighthearted and deeply nourishing, but they require some input too. They require people to be vulnerable and open and participatory and courageous. It's hard, but so rewarding.

Your post makes me miss the simpler times when all it took to make a new friend was: *""Hey, do you wanna be my friend?""* I don't think you should internalise the reasons why some of your friendships haven't worked in the past. Often, life just gets in the way. It's not necessarily you. While it might be hard to make new friends given where you are in life, and given all the obstacles that life (and the kind of culture we've built) can throw in the way, there's still a chance to discover highly rewarding connections that last a lifetime.

In the end, I feel like we all just want to be seen. We all just want to be acknowledged and loved. We all just want to be appreciated for who we are. We want to be seen without judgement. We want to find people who can navigate around the barriers that we try so hard to put up. We want friends who can excite us and hold interesting conversations. We want people who won't use us for their own ends. That's hard to find, but it's possible to attain. Don't lose hope.

Actually, sometimes it's easy. Sometimes a person can just show up in your life and want nothing more than to establish a friendship for its own sake. Sometimes it's just that easy.

Anyway, what's life about for you? What do you care about? Where are you going? Are you happy in spite of everything you've written? Do you feel seen? Do you feel hopeful about the future? Are you on good terms with your conscience? I would love to know.

Advice,fpa76fw,t3_gc9stp,1588442189.0,"I understand the feeling you're describing. I understand what it means to know something intellectually but for that feeling to resist translation into your body. I'm sure you know that it doesn't help to compare yourself to others. I'm sure you know that there are things more important in life than your placement on some imagined social hierarchical scale. I'm sure you know that it doesn't help you to denigrate your own achievements by stacking them up against those of other people. But, how do you get yourself to feel this permanently? How do you get yourself to feel this with your heart and soul rather than just your mind?

I wish it were easy.

It seems that you've already found the beginnings of a solution: ""*But then when I come home to my wife and she’s happy as can be, and we have fun and play video games together and go on bike rides and I can read and feel happy, I realize that I have a great life""*. Concentrate on that aspect of your life as much as possible. Concentrate on the things that are actually of substantial value in the long run.

Give yourself room to breathe by acknowledging that you are still young. You have a whole lifetime ahead of you. There is a day in the not-so-distant future during which all the pains you're going through now will justify your future success. There's a day coming when none of your current fears and insecurities will matter all that much. There's a day coming when you will have earning the degree you're fighting for now, when you have a career related to that degree, when you have built an even more intimate and happy life with your wife, and when you're no longer striving to initiate the meaning of your life (there's a time coming when you'll be actively living that meaning).

This, of course, doesn't answer the question of how to get yourself to feel this with all your soul. Maybe there is no way to overcome it completely. After all, we are biologically programmed to be quite sensitive to environmental cues about social status. Maybe there is no permanent escape from this feeling. But, maybe you can offset any anxieties you feel by keeping in mind that your situation is temporary, that there are better days ahead, that you're actively trying to improve your life, and that comparing your *worst* to another person's *best* is not only unproductive but also bad form. 

Alternatively, you can go much deeper into your attempts to compare yourself to others by asking yourself *""so what?""*

Like actually, so what? Or, more importantly: why does it matter?

Write it out. Think it through. Go deep into your own fears and anguishes about this. In the end, you'll find that your self-comparisons are either without substantial value or that they're revealing something about yourself that is yearning to grow and fulfil its own potential. Either way, your fears and discomforts will begin to dissolve progressively.  

I'll stop here. There's lots more I could say about this issue. I hope this helps.

AskReddit,foy1j96,t3_ga884c,1588162963.0,"I think it's important to interpret the feeling of *""not being good enough""* in the most productive way. Most people interpret it incorrectly and thus extract the wrong lesson out of it. I feel like many people think something along the lines of *""this person is better than me and I feel compelled to imitate them and their life so that I can have self-value and self-worth too""*.

Don't do that to yourself. You're worth more than that. Imitation can be its own form of self-degradation. I think it's better to interpret that feeling as a sign that something within you feels that it's not living up to its own potential. Go into that feeling further. Examine it more closely. Don't use another person as a blueprint for your own self-construction. Rather, ask yourself which general traits you see in them that you would like to embody yourself. Then, I suppose, do your best to emulate the traits in a way that is aligned with your personal interests and desires.

And talk to them. Talk to them. Talk to them openly. Talk to them consistently. Talk about all of this. If you feel that you can't talk about this feeling openly with your partner then something else is clearly wrong in the relationship. Sometimes (and probably more often than not), it isn't the quality of a person in absolute terms that matters to their partner—rather, it's their ongoing commitment to growth and self-improvement, to living life to the fullest, being a kind person, and finding new ways to approach life in interesting ways. 

Be patient with yourself. Realise that such changes don't happen in a single instant. Make sure to keep close track of the things for which you're most grateful. Godspeed, my friend. 

CAVEAT: If you're making numerical comparisons like *""he/she makes more money than me""* or *""he/she weighs less than me""* or *""he/she has a greater number of friends than me""* then escaping that kind of thinking becomes a little more tricky, But, there are ways to do this too. A quantitative comparison of that kind can be escaped if you commit yourself to a macroscopic approach: *""yes, he/she makes more money than me but within a broader context, that fact isn't relevant to our interpersonal dynamic—which ultimately means that my value as a partner in this relationship isn't tied to my monetary value""*. Change the context of your comparison and you can generate a different result."

DecidingToBeBetter,fkq5mzd,t3_fk0qj8,1584431551.0,"Most of what I’m about to write is a paraphrasing of statements by Eve Sedgwick. I would say to you that it's hard for people to recognise that your soul doesn't move at the speed of your intellectual thought. It’s important to keep in mind that it could take you a year to really know something that you intellectually believe in a second. I’ll quote Sedgwick directly here because she said it far better than I ever could. It’s important for people to learn “how not to feel ashamed of the amount of time things take, or the recalcitrance of emotional or personal change.”

There are so many more things I would want to know about you before I even began to guess why you might not be feeling excited anymore. However, I can say that inner changes take time. Even though you’re in a new place, doing better things, earning money, and being around other people, it can still take time for your soul to catch up to your new situation. I know that sucks but that’s how it is sometimes. It can take a while to shed the pains of the past.

One last thing I would say is that it’s important that you don’t try to fix emotional issues with material things. Having money and the new PC is great — but there are limits to the things that can be addressed with material successes. 

Have you considered talking to someone about this? If possible, you should consider speaking to a trained specialist who can help you carry out a deeper analysis of you and your life to see if there might be more serious underlying issues."

The mission itself doesn't have to be a grand, lofty, noble or heavenly sort of aim; it can be as simple as ""I wish to be a better friend to those around me"".

I personally feel that once you have that kind of purpose in mind, you'll find it's easier to draw the lines between self-care and indulgence, and between healthy critique and berating. Once you have that kind of mission in mind, you can ask yourself the following simple question: does this help the cause? 

If the only thing that your self-criticism does is to make you feel terrible and thus less able to fulfil your objective, then you've probably crossed the line into berating. If the only thing your self-care does is to make you too comfortable and thus less willing to face the fears associated to your mission, then you've probably crossed over into indulgence.

DecidingToBeBetter,fknsy9m,t1_fknjxqd,1584373262.0,"I personally believe that there are many viable ways to tackle the issue of not feeling good enough. First of all, I feel like it would be really useful to challenge the idea that you will never be good enough. A person can't feel perfect all the time, but they should do their best not to hold onto the idea that they will always be terrible. 

You should definitely take the time to celebrate the fact that you're committed to self-development and growth even when you're currently dealing with the weight of your depression. That's no small feat. That's actually something to be proud of. 

It has been a long and arduous struggle. I haven't yet healed myself (and I don't know if I will ever be completely healed) but I realised that self-loathing wasn't getting me anywhere good. There's a statement by a philosopher called Alan Watts that I'm very fond of: “The alternative to self-love is self-destruction. Because you won’t take the risk of loving yourself properly, you will be compelled instead to destroy yourself. So which would you rather have?”

The terrible irony of depression is that it takes away the very things that you need to defeat it — and it also makes reclaiming those things feel impossibly difficult. I also feel that some paths are better taken directly (without hesitation or digression). The best way to love is to love. The best way to heal is to heal. I admit that there are some things that need to be done before someone is able to love themselves correctly, but I don't think someone should dwell on theory/plans/ambitions for too long.

DecidingToBeBetter,fkb4z9f,t3_fhc658,1584026225.0,"No, you aren’t truly pathetic and worthless. I don’t know the details of your life but it’s safe to say that your self-perception is being severely clouded by your lack of confidence and self-loathing. 

I categorically refuse to accept that there is anyone on this planet who doesn’t have a talent, interest, hobby or skill that cannot be honed. But that might be beside the point. Let’s start somewhere else. 

Are you sure you know yourself well? How comprehensively do you know yourself? Do you know yourself objectively? Are you trapped in a subjective and horrifically negative view of yourself? 

The reason I ask those questions is because there can be no self-respect without self-knowledge, and there can’t be adequate self-knowledge without a clear perception of your vices AND your virtues. And right now it seems to me that you’ve dug yourself into a hole from which you can only see what’s wrong with you.

You say you HAVE depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, low energy and ADHD. You might be afflicted by these things but they aren’t a fundamental part of your being. Imagine for a moment that you weren’t held back by these ‘disorders’, who would you be then? What kind of person would you be? In which things would you be interested? How would you interact with others? Thinking about such things can help you make critical distinctions between the person you really are and the disorders you mistakenly believe to be an integral part of your identity. 

True self-respect is a challenging thing. Self-respect is learned and refined across a lifetime. For some people it is a lesson learned a little more easily, but that doesn’t mean that it is impossible for others.

No one ever improves themselves or their own life unless they feel that there is something of value to improve. It’s very difficult to nurture a positive relationship with something unless you have some kind of respect for it in the first place.

As far as what you’re trying to achieve is concerned, a capacity for self-love is vital. Why would you go to class unless you valued yourself and your prospects in life? Why would you develop any hobbies unless you believed that you were worthy of having such interests? Why would you show up for yourself unless you truly felt that you were the kind of person worthy of such commitments?

There are very many threads in what you’ve written. I don’t think your issues need to be resolved sequentially, but it’s also important to not overwhelm yourself by thinking you need to resolve everything very quickly at once.

Deepening your self-knowledge might help you discover something within you that’s worthy of love and respect. And when I ask if you know who you are, I don’t mean that in a superficial autobiographical sense: *“my name is \_\_\_\_ and I grew up in \_\_\_\_\_ and I like \_\_\_\_\_ and I want to be \_\_\_\_\_ when I grow up”.* That’s the kind of surface-level material that inhibits true self-discovery. Perhaps if you discover something within yourself that’s worthy of respect, you might be able to generate a deeper motivation to resolve the other issues. 

And if you cringe at the idea of even loving yourself then that’s all the more reason to commit to it. 

All the other advice you’ve received still stands, go to therapy. Talk to others. It’s hard to give you advice when there is still so much more that I would like to know about you. There is no one-size-fits-all advice. It needs to be tailored to you and your particular situation — which is why you need to go to therapy (if you can) or to engage in deep conversations with people who know you and who can offer you different perspectives."

DecidingToBeBetter,fk7owvf,t3_fgvyfi,1583940803.0,"It seems to me that you already have the right conceptual approach to me. You already know that you need to be in competition with yourself and that you shouldn’t be comparing yourself to others. The question, however, is how do you get yourself to feel that way emotionally? It’s one thing for the mind to understand something at the conceptual level, but getting the heart to resonate with that idea is a totally different thing. 

Maybe you need to offer yourself better counter-narratives every time you find yourself comparing yourself and your life to others. You need to redefine your understanding of what it means to be “further ahead”. Just because someone seems to have amassed more professional, academic, and material accomplishments doesn’t mean that they are actually further ahead. I mean, further ahead along what line? The idea of being “further ahead” is even only conceptually possible if you have a predetermined idea of what it means to life a good life — and I understand that society will offer you very many templates of what it means to live a good life — school, university, job, marriage, house, kids, hobbies, grandkids…death? Life isn’t a linear thing that is comprised of a series of steps that need to be attained sequentially. Life is a multidimensional thing that can be lived in very dynamic ways at any given moment. Imagination can carry you into the future, memories can transport you to the past, a creative approach to the present moment can reveal joyous things that are hidden right under your nose. It’s very possible for someone to be “further ahead” materially and yet be “left behind” emotionally, spiritually, psychologically, psychically etc. Consider this: would you rather be where you are now or have all the material accomplishments that you envy in others but be suicidally depressed at the same time?

Still, this doesn’t really answer your question. How do you get yourself to really FEEL differently about this? You know all these things with your mind, but how do you get to know them with your body and with your heart? 

I think you need to redevelop your relationship to your ego. I suppose that it’s really your ego that’s wounded whenever your compare yourself to others. It’s really the ego that generates all those depressing considerations of “am I good enough?” or “am I worthy?” or “am I a failure?” or “did I make the wrong choices in life?”. The ego can never be satisfied. The ego can always invent a higher level that needs to be attained in order to achieve true happiness. So, disconnect yourself from your ego as often as possible. Or try to anyway. How do you do this? Well, there are many methods to dissociation from the tyranny of the ego. They range from ‘psychedelic/hallucinogenic annihilation of the ego’ to simple meditation. They include activities such as community engagement, volunteering, exercise, painting, journaling, better breathing, getting temporarily lost in fictional worlds — basically, there are an infinite number of roads leading to inner freedom. What matters isn’t so much the path you take but rather the quality of your effort against the temptation to compare yourself to others. Performing these activities as often as possible and in new and exciting ways might help you forget yourself. If you do these things often enough, you might even find that you don’t really have the time to compare yourself to others — or that even if you do have the time, that it’s not worth such an investment.

But how do you REALLY REALLY get yourself to FEEL differently permanently? How do you escape the pain/temptation of comparing yourself to others forever and ever and ever? Is such a thing even possible? 

Well, for starters, I don’t know if there is a road that leads to permanent salvation from these pains. We are human beings after all. We’re bizarre organisms running highly advanced intellectual software on really old biological hardware. Maybe you will forever be a victim to your monkey-mind to a certain degree — but that doesn’t mean you need to be tyrannised by your lesser, self-pitying self until the end of time.  

If you can’t escape the temptation to compare yourself to others, then at least do so in the right way. In fact, you can even cheat here if you want. Do so in a way that makes you feel good. Compare your best to their worst. It seems to me that what you’re doing here is comparing your worst to their best. And who could ever survive such kind of inner judgement? No one. 

Okay, here’s a curveball. What if there’s a hidden lesson in the pain you’re feeling now? What if your own soul is trying to communicate to you that there is something you’re not yet doing in a way that truly honours your individual potential? What if there is a lesson to be gleaned from all this pain? 

This reminds me of an ancient story of a wise Chinese monk who was asked by his disciple:*‘How shall we escape the heat?’* — meaning, of course, the heat of existential suffering. The wise monk answered: *‘Go right into the middle of the fire.* The astonished disciple responded: *‘But how, then, shall we escape the scorching flame?’* To which the wise monk finally replied: *‘No further pain will trouble you!’*

Maybe you’re prolonging your own pain by trying to run away from it. There is a chance you will learn something by leaning into your pain and witnessing what it has to reveal. I’m not saying that you suddenly need to start chasing after a PhD or a house or having a kid. No, that’s not it at all. 

Maybe what’s really torturing you whenever you compare yourself to others isn’t that they are doing better than you but rather that you aren’t doing enough to honour the best in yourself. 

I’m not sure how to end this looooooong message. I’ll end with a statement by Terence McKenna; it’s not entirely applicable to your situation but there’s something about it that seems to resonate with this situation and with your mindset: *“Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed.”* 

*PS: Forgive any typos this message might contain. I wrote this fairly quickly and don’t have the time to proofread everything.*"

selfimprovement,fipwd5f,t3_f97yzm,1582624851.0,"I think that anyone would be intimidated under those circumstances. If you focus on ALL 1000 things that need to be addressed before the task is officially finished you will never get anything done. You will never ever have to complete an entire project in a single continuous swoop. 

How would you feel if you divided each task into smaller micro-tasks and then committed to completing *only one* of those micro-tasks? You can really only take one step at a time, and there's a strong chance that taking a single step will give you motivation/energy to take another. And another. And another. And before you know it, you're halfway done with the task.

It also sounds like you might be experiencing a little guilt about not being able to overcome this ""flaw"". In situations like this, I believe that a little self-compassion goes a long way.

He explores many of the ideas that philosophy is commonly believed to be about (love, death, fear, meaning, identity etc.) but he does so by always grounding it in his own intense emotional experiences.

CPTSD,fi73vf0,t3_f6trw0,1582213748.0,"This is one of those moments that the philosopher Alan Watts used to call a 'Backwards Law' moment. In other words, the more actively and arduously you fight against your negative feelings the more powerful they appear to become. It's a very unfortunate situation to be in. It feels inescapable at times. It's an all-consuming toxic negativity that warps anything that seems even remotely positive into yet another reason to contemplate death and nonexistence. 

What if you didn't fight against it so hard? Now wait a minute, I'm not at all implying that you should accept these feelings and act upon them in a catastrophically decisive way. I understand that the pain you're in is demanding some kind of resolution, but what if you discussed these feelings with someone in a nonjudgemental way without struggling too hard to resolve them immediately? Would that give you a little more space to breathe and rest a little? 

I'm not a therapist but it seems to me that in moments like these, you need to be very careful not to make sweeping generalisations and overstatements about the way you feel. The way out of the pain you're feeling might depend on your ability to make the most of those tiny, subtle, and nuanced positive moments. Do you really feel horrible *nonstop*? Do you really have no control over your life *at all*? I'm willing to bet that if you talked about all this stuff with someone in a nonjudgemental way you would begin to find very brief moments that might give you a reason to believe that something positive could exist in the near future. Perhaps. And given how it seems you're feeling right now, ""perhaps"" is enough of a reason to want to try.

It's hard to be attentive and receptive to those good small moments when there's an overwhelming barrage of sh\*tty feelings, but I think that it's necessary now more than ever for you to do exactly that. And by ""good moments"" I don't necessarily mean moments that are filled with a kind of superficial bliss. I just mean moments that are less easy to interpret as blatantly terrible. Did a sunbeam stream through your window in a way that momentarily evoked  a distant memory of a long gone happy Sunday afternoon? That's a good moment.

There's no reason to believe that a short moment of that kind can't be extended into something much more durable and more sustainable. But you've got to be willing to try. And you have to be willing to try it with someone that gives you the space to do so in a way nonjudgemental (and understanding) way.

I think once you find and extend those positive moments, you can begin to address and resolve the deeper issues that are making you feel this terrible to start with. 

If you want to talk, well, you know how to find me. Send me a message if you'd like.

In any case, godspeed."

Modern art is, to me, a perfect illustration of the kind of art that Camus lampooned for ""taking shape outside of society and cutting itself off from its living roots"". I really hope that your prediction is correct — that we will enter a new age of technical and artistic mastery as the new counterculture.
