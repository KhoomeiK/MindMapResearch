This makes me miss my grandfather. I used to hate driving him around, he was very particular. But I went grocery shopping with him when he couldn‚Äôt drive anymore and still wanted to get out. Towards the end of his life, I would bring him to play poker at the senior center every week. The drive was long and slow, but it was worth it. It made him so happy to get to play his favorite game with his friends, especially after my grandmother passed. 

Cherish any moment you can with him. I‚Äôm not saying you have to actually fish yourself. But unless medically you can‚Äôt get on a boat, please try to bend in some ways to help him enjoy something he very obviously loves, while spending time with you. You don‚Äôt have to do it often.

Whoever said that is wrong. Anytime you‚Äôre in public, both indoors and outdoors, you must have a mask now. This is a major part of the reopening plan.

Tenant,fpq7y5c,t3_get5fj,1588816983.0,"What does your lease say?

ETA: Odd as it may seem, most state laws do not require landlords to provide major appliances such as refrigerators or stove, although many (probably most) landlords do. So, if you see a refrigerator or stove in a rental unit, you would naturally expect that if it breaks down, the landlord must fix it. Sounds logical, right? Think again. Some landlords, trying to save money, include a clause in their leases stating that the appliances are there for the tenant‚Äôs use, but are not part of the rent. These types of clauses usually say if the tenant uses the appliances, the tenant is responsible for the repairs and maintenance of the appliances

boston,fp0moel,t1_fp04v6u,1588212369.0,I didn‚Äôt realize the beaches were open. Though it hasn‚Äôt really been warm enough for most people to be out on them.
Landlord,fp0mlov,t1_fozy6dw,1588212323.0,"Seriously, I wouldn‚Äôt go after a company that basically did me a big favor. Even if it wasn‚Äôt ready to come down yet it seems it was only a matter of time."
VintageDisney,fp01017,t1_fowgaf3,1588200461.0,"And brides especially weren‚Äôt happy, I can kind of understand why but I still love the castle."
VintageDisney,fp00ycs,t1_fown54k,1588200436.0,This was from my family‚Äôs Disney albums haha I wish I still had any of the memorabilia from back then!
VintageDisney,fp00syn,t1_fovwkf9,1588200356.0,Yes!! I hope even with everything happening they‚Äôre going to make up the castle beautifully next year
boston,fp00kqg,t1_fozyi7b,1588200234.0,I wouldn‚Äôt even be a little surprised if I saw that in a store at this point.
boston,fozurbi,t1_fozj3zu,1588197219.0,Thanks. I was wondering what on earth someone would need a wetsuit for right now.
Pawtucket,fozu64b,t1_foy7yp8,1588196921.0,"That was even better to watch, he did do wonderfully"
unexpectedhogwarts,foxq277,t3_ga1vh6,1588152272.0,Pretty sure I‚Äôve read that as Ford *Angelia* since the books came out. Ive only reread them ten or so times since then. Wonder what else I‚Äôve messed up on for so long.
AnimalRescue,foxpc1x,t3_ga27yl,1588151530.0,"Location? Basic dog info? 

Is he yours, why does he need a home? Was he abandoned, medical issues, bred and unable to find a home? Details are important.

ETA: he‚Äôs insanely cute , though he looks possibly part pit and that‚Äôs a very important disclosure."
AskDocs,fovt3gh,t1_fovngps,1588107050.0,‚ÄúNo offense‚Äù and then ‚Äúit‚Äôs kind of dumb‚Äù. Maybe if you really don‚Äôt mean to offend try to work on your wording.
disneyparks,fovr42t,t1_fovjtgj,1588106076.0,"I bet they could pull this off!! It would look magical, and I bet would be more popular than the birthday cake"
disneyparks,fovqzzc,t1_foux4w8,1588106020.0,"I still can‚Äôt imagine they won‚Äôt do *something* special with the castle still. But I was reading a bit about the new Epcot earlier, very excited to see how that turns out."
disneyparks,fovqti7,t1_fovnwve,1588105931.0,Ah the birthday cake controversy üòÇ
disneyparks,fovqpn7,t1_fovj4wy,1588105878.0,It was Walt Disney World (Florida) in 1997 for their 25th anniversary. Their 50th is next year so maybe you‚Äôll get a chance to see something else incredible!
disneyparks,fovqlde,t1_fovercs,1588105819.0,Makes total sense but I didn‚Äôt actually remember they were inflatables until your comment! Sharing this has made me realize how little I remember from that age.
disneyparks,fovqbxz,t1_fov9ysl,1588105694.0,That would have confused me as a kid. I don‚Äôt remember anything leading up to it but I won‚Äôt ever forget so many parts of that trip.
disneyparks,fovcnxo,t1_fov8wql,1588099098.0,Haha that‚Äôs such a dad thing to do
disneyparks,fov4vme,t1_fov2dnc,1588095419.0,"That‚Äôs actually how I realized I never saw the original castle. I‚Äôve looked in my family albums before but it just didn‚Äôt click. Last year on this sub there was a thread about those brides and other people who were absolutely pisses about the change. I guess I can understand the shock if they were expecting the original castle, but do they not realize just how unique their Disney wedding photos are?? It‚Äôs crazy I would feel special haha"
disneyparks,fov3fcc,t1_fouz7i0,1588094745.0,Had no idea that was a sub. Not that I really need another one to scroll through endlessly haha Thank you!!
massachusetts,fov37vs,t3_g9l3z6,1588094650.0,At least the weather has kept people off the beaches and parks and mostly at home. I only hope when it warms up people don‚Äôt start ignoring social distancing
disneyparks,fouwfkb,t1_fouvx9k,1588091518.0,I cannot wait to see what they‚Äôre planning for the 50th!! I bet it‚Äôll be spectacular.
disneyparks,fouw599,t1_fouvpte,1588091385.0,I do too! Now I feel I‚Äôve got to see the original just once though haha
gifs,fouk96t,t1_foujrj7,1588085603.0,"He has gloves on, as long as he‚Äôs not using that gloves hand to touch anything else he should be fine. I‚Äôm assuming the tongs are to pass them without getting that hand-to-hand interaction."
Tenant,foufozy,t3_g9kgff,1588083190.0,"They aren‚Äôt required to continue to lease to you once your lease is up, but they tried to give you the chance to stay. You dropped the ball on this one. The mentioning of signs in your lease isn‚Äôt an extended deadline, the landlord clearly doesn‚Äôt want the unit empty for even a month and you weren‚Äôt guaranteeing that"
RhodeIsland,foub411,t1_fot1n7h,1588080518.0,"You must be fun at parties. It‚Äôs a little joke, and many people have nothing but time now so relax."
AskReddit,foq1vex,t3_g8sp1p,1587979943.0,"I don‚Äôt know if they would be worth anything, but I will forever be bitter about all my original Trolls that went missing in the divorce."
