schizophrenia,fr4dubv,t1_fr3bbom,1589885025.0,"I assume that last point you made has a lot to do with how schizophrenia is viewed by media. For example: when the movie 'split' came out in Germany I've read many many discussions about it. People claimed that he's schizophrenic ( often mixed up with the deep belief that DID is the same as schizophrenia). I maybe sound a little mean right now but: many human beings aren't 'disciplined' enough to check their fact or even inform themselves on a specific topic, they (at least where I live) take Media for granted... another example is the shooting in a city called Halle. 

To break it down for you: A racist ahole shot multiple people and tried to get into a synagogue by explosives. After that some German media said he was schizophrenic... 
Well turn out he wasn't, but he was into conspiracy theories, and just an racist ahole.
BUT : many people now belief that he was schizophrenic, and that this could happen with everyone who's diagnosed with schizophrenia...


for those who want to look up the whole story:
[Halle shooting ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_synagogue_shooting)

So yeah my therapist and I think that it is mostly how schizophrenia is, and was, viewed by media. And the fact that no one wants to do some sort puplic-education stuff. Maybe because the group of people is 'too small' so not many could possibly relate to it... Idk but to me it seems very needed since people not only have the misconception that schizophrenics are 'evil', but also often think that DID is the same as schizophrenia. 


Sorry for the poor English and the long text"
schizophrenia,fr042hc,t1_fqz759v,1589783125.0,well here in Germany it really depends on the doc. My old psychiatrist was more likely to just hand you another medication while my new one is just as you describe it. He tend to just brush it off and tell you to take it until the side-effects end.
