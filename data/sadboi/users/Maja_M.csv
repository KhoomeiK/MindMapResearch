Apart from what others have suggested about delineating home and work, keep in mind that almost everyone (including me) is feeling this way given the current circumstances as it's simply harder (almost impossible for some) to have ANY work life balance when you can't go anywhere and do the things you'd typically do.

birthcontrol,f992re0,t3_e48hm2,1575186250.0,"My friend, I think we might be related. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I too recall going to a GP asking for something a bit more permanent when I was your age and was denied. I don't have all the answers for you but maybe my experiences will help. So far, the best thing is condoms only. I know men whinge but they can fuck off - birth control should be equally their responsibility. However, condoms are only great if they don't break or slip off. Plan B is only so effective. Second best thing was the copper IUD. However, once it settled (took about 8 months) I bled for 9 days out of the month (an improvement from 11-12 initially and I'm on a 28 day cycle) and I had recurrent thrush. If you want to try this option I'd GP shop until you get it with anesthesia.

I've tried the following also with bad side effects from DVT to horrible acne to moodiness to never ending thrush/bleeding and both at the same time, i could go on (yay for me- I'm super sensitive): Implanon (rebranded as Nexplanon), combined pill (several brands), Depo. 

I'm using Microlut (mini pill) now and so far it's been terrible. I'm bleeding every 2 weeks (yay), fell pregnant and miscarried despite perfect use (that shit is taken within 10 minutes every fucking day). I've asked to try a different band of mini pill (noriday) and the GP has been uncooperative sending me for an ultrasound (at my expense). When the ultrasound came back normal he still wouldn't give me the fucking script. So I will never go back to that clinic again. I'm hopeful a real GP and new brand of mini pill will help... otherwise I'm pretty fucked, and not in the good way. Condom fail is high with my fiance who lubes up the inside too much and it's prone to slippage. 
Best of luck to you x"
