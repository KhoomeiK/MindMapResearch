needadvice,fo5m07n,t3_g5oi5w,1587529004.0,"I was very much a people pleaser at school - I suppose I still am now, although to a lesser extent. I let people walk all over me. I “helped” them with work and homework (ie gave them the answers), and took risks in tests by giving people answers (fortunately not formal exams). I was even the only person in my advanced Chem class to actually carry out the experiments for the graded laboratory section of the course, and they just “adapted” my results. I was very much raised with the attitude to be nice to people and offer help, but I can be quite literal with my thinking and didn’t distinguish between helping and being a doormat. The first time I learned to say no was really difficult. It’s taken a while and I don’t always get it right, but I can establish boundaries and only help if I am able (both in terms of skill and emotional availability). Thing is, good friends don’t mind at all and will respect boundaries. Anyone who doesn’t accept a no was never a friend. It’s not a black and white case of either helping people at college or seeming cold hearted - it’s just establishing boundaries that work for you. Some quotes that worked for me:
“I’m sorry, but I’m swamped and have no time to offer you any help right now” (depending on the situation I may offer alternative times, suggest help resources they could look into, or just leave it as is)
“I don’t know the answer to that I’m afraid”
“I want to support you as your friend, but this is a situation where I wouldn’t be able to support you in the way you need and I don’t want to risk making things worse. You need to get in touch with [relevant professional or expert]” (I would offer to help find said professional and be someone they can vent to, but not be a source of advice)
“I’m really struggling with X right now and am not able to help anyone effectively at this time”

Another thing I wanted to mention is that if you want to tell people about being misdiagnosed, you can do that! An example of wording can be: “So my diagnosis of Aspergers didn’t feel right to me and the support offered as a result wasn’t beneficial at all. After some persistence and consultation with doctors/therapists, they’ve concluded that this diagnosis was incorrect. It’s a relief to have this confirmed and for my medical records to now be accurate so that I no longer receive unnecessary treatments. Thank you for the support you have given me during this time of uncertainty!” (Obviously I kept this very formal and generic as I don’t know you or those involved - it can be personalised to fit you). 

I know there were other things you brought up, but know that your life isn’t ruined and you definitely can move forward. You just need some support! Keep working with doctors and therapists to find a treatment regime that works for you. Focus on yourself for a while. Look into some self-help resources for helping with drawing boundaries (gaining assertiveness), improving your confidence, improving your social skills, etc. Also, try reaching out to these friends again! Don’t go in with any expectations, just see where it goes. If a relationship isn’t reestablised then you’re in the same position you are now, so you won’t lose anything by trying. 

My final piece of advice (in an admittedly long and muddled post...) is to stop focusing so much on what other people might think. You’re not always going to know how someone feels or what motivates people to do certain things, and you need to learn to be ok with not knowing that. If you don’t do things because of fearing how someone may react, then you will never be happy. If you think something will make life easier for you and make you happier, then do it (within reason of course, nothing illegal or immoral) - people will have opinions and we just have to accept that. You also can’t change or control what they think, so it’s not useful to focus on something in order to make them feel a certain way. The only person you can control is yourself.

Overall, give yourself a break. You can get through the tough spot, it’ll just take a little work. Best of luck!"

askwomenadvice,fnr5gfg,t1_fnr4noc,1587179754.0,"I think that’s an excellent idea! Big changes are far easier when you take small and gradual steps. So for the example you gave, a response like “I’m having breakfast right now. Tell sister to Google it and see what she can find on her own, and I’ll check in with her when I’m ready” in the early stages, which could eventually lead to “sorry, can’t help”. 

It’s worth coming up with a back-up plan if they remain in denial and don’t alter their behaviour by the time you move out. You should be prepared for every eventuality and know how you will cope with each possible outcome. In the end, the only person you can control and whose actions you can predict is yourself."

I don’t want to sugarcoat it, but it’s going to be challenging. You’ll need to gather as much emotional strength as you can (counselling may help, you should be able to get something through your school). They’re going to guilt you, and it’s going to be hard to deal with that. They’ve depended on you bailing them out for so long that they don’t know how to survive on their own. But they need to. They need to know you are serious and you will no longer be supporting them financially. You can help them prepare for this and encourage them to start saving. Point them in the direction of financial planners, doctors and counsellors, but it’s up to them if they want to pursue this. But you’re going to get the comments - that you’re “abandoning them”, that you’re “selfish”, that “family comes first” etc. You can’t give into them. You can’t give up your life and dreams to support a family that won’t support you. Your sister made the choice not to support her mother, so why can’t you? She’s financially independent and needs to learn to live within her means. They’re all adults and know the basics, they’ll survive and figure things out - they just haven’t had to yet. 

To paraphrase an old saying - poor planning on their end doesn’t constitute an emergency on yours."
relationship_advice,fnr1eyk,t3_g3agev,1587176990.0,"I understand Kim is tiresome. I understand money is tight. But you’ve got 18 months to figure this out. Save up money and stay in a hotel for that week. You might not ever have to stay the whole week - just stay for the wedding/reception and leave if that’s possible. There are ways you can work around the accommodation arrangements so that you can avoid being with the in-laws. But please, please reconsider this. Everyone here is telling you that this will destroy your relationship with your daughter, and it will. She’s not going to see this as “dad’s just making it easier on us” but as “dad doesn’t support me and cares more about his own comfort than my happiness”. 

You can practice how to avoid Kim and not get dragged into arguments. This is something she is passionate about, and it’s something you can navigate. For example, looking at an example you gave and using it for the wedding:

“Kim, you look wonderful. Congratulations, I’m so happy for you both and delighted to welcome you to the family. You must be so happy!”
“As long as we are being oppressed, I’ll never be happy”
“I agree that it is so sad that there are many injustices in this world and that people are persecuted for being who they are. We are truly fortunate today that the two of you can marry and be happy together. We must focus on the positives.”
*attempts to escalate*
“Oh no, who let Uncle Frank get to the punch? I better intervene or he’ll be dancing topless on the tabletops before we get to the speeches. I’ll leave you both to greet the guests and will catch up with you at dinner!” *walk away*

Acknowledge the plight, deflect and distract, then walk away before more can be said. Remain polite and don’t show frustration. If she’s persistent, you can be more firm:

“Kim, I know this is something that means a lot to you and I can’t possibly understand the struggles you or the community have gone through. But this is you and [daughter]’S wedding day and we need to focus on that. Let’s not fight about this and focus on this day, for [daughter]’s sake.” 

Don’t engage with the arguments and avoid her as much as you can, while remaining polite and civil.

askwomenadvice,fnquiip,t3_g37zy5,1587172520.0,"This is not a healthy situation for you or the children. You need to stand up to your fiancé and insist he steps up to the plate or you leave. If you keep things as they are, you will spend your life in constant fear, you and your children will be in danger and this child will get worse. Your fiancé needs to get things sorted in court (whether he wants to or not), either to arrange a custody order or give up his parental rights as per the results of the paternity test (although having heard things from the legal positions he may still be liable for child support). If he is stubborn, you seek legal advice from a family law expert. And you need to draw strict boundaries - if your fiancé is not willing to discipline this child then your fiancé needs to move out and keep this child away from the house. Your children (especially the baby) are not safe around this child and as their mother it’s up to you to protect them.

As bad as this child is, he is also a victim. Neglected by his father and parental alienation by his mother. An intervention is needed by a professional, whether the parents want it or not. This isn’t about them, this is about a troubled 6-year-old. You can’t stay silent. This is beyond your capabilities and you need help. This needs to be reported to a specialist (I don’t know what social services are available to you, CPS?). I am absolutely not judging you and you are in a difficult position, but if your fiancé and the boy’s mother are more interested in hating each other, someone needs to advocate for this child. He needs a stable home away from such toxicity. It may make your fiancé angry so I get why that seems hard, but children are a priority- this boy needs help, and your children need to be kept safe from his violence. Stay safe, get help, and good luck. 

(This is difficult for me to write - I don’t ever want to come across as confrontational. But this is a situation that needs sorting and I want you to get help and be safe; and for the children to be safe)"

relationship_advice,fn58u07,t1_fn3msmf,1586658723.0,"I met my best friend at university- I was just starting my PhD and he was in his second year (different field, we met through mutual friends). I had to leave after two years (which included about 7-9 months leave of absence) due to my health and course struggles. Leaving a PhD basically sealed the end of my dream career in medical research (I had an interview for a part time lab tech and when asking for feedback was told “good luck ever getting back into science because I don’t see anyone hiring someone who leaves a PhD”). I was unemployed for a year and finally found my current admin job (4.5 years). It’s been devastating for me and I still struggle with that feeling of failure.

My best friend completed his PhD. He applied for one postdoctoral position, got an interview and got the job. After his second, he is now a lecturer. He succeeded where I failed. I have envied him. So how did I react? I congratulated every success. I consoled every interview rejection. I helped him with applications. I reminded him how amazing he was when his mental health took over and gave him imposter syndrome. I’ve been amongst his top cheerleaders. I may struggle with envy and don’t deny shedding a few tears, but I don’t put that shit on him because my failures were not caused by his successes. That’s what you do when you care about someone. 

You succeeding academically did not cause him to drop out. He should not make you feel so guilty that you’d consider leaving your course (which you absolutely should NOT do). I’m glad to see from your update that you understand he’s treating you badly and plan to get out when you can. And congrats on your amazing achievements and rocking the life of adulting!"
JustNoSO,fn55fk9,t3_fz9xja,1586656361.0,"I second suggestions of therapy and parenting classes. But as it may take a while to get something like that arranged, there are little things that could be helpful for him.

First, write down everything you usually do, then sit with him and agree a schedule that he can follow. I’m dyspraxic and really struggle with organisation and routine tasks, unless I have the full steps written out in detail. I then follow these slowly and steadily until I’ve done it enough times to become ingrained in my brain (I sometimes even find myself calling my mum and asking her to work through steps with me if I get confused). It’s frustrating for others and may be for you, but it might help in the long term for him to have this rather than constantly asking you for instructions. And not just a list for general household tasks, but also a feeding schedule for your daughter - beneficial for him; but also for her. Make sure to track how much she’s eating too, as that can help you both figure out if there are any issues.

Finally, when he is calm (definitely important not to approach him when angry), talk through why he gets frustrated with the baby. Then offer a way he can work through it. So when he feels himself getting angry, make sure your child is in the crib (and in a safe position) and get him to take a few deep breaths. If he can’t get calm, then he leaves the room and just breathes deeply for 10 minutes. He needs to learn to walk away when he feels angry and not release his frustration by yelling at her. Also, another list suggestion, but get him to go through a checklist of “why my baby is crying” and work through each one:

- does DD need a bottle? 
- does DD’s diaper need changing?
- does DD need burping?
- does DD need a cuddle/attention?
- is DD tired and needing help to calm her to sleep?
- is he getting stressed out and thus stressing her out?
- is she not feeling well? Check for a fever, look out for anything unusual, check if she’s shifting a lot to avoid a certain part of her body, etc.

After a few times, he’ll start to recognise her typical cries and feel more confident with which option to start with. 

Approach it with love and as an offer of help, rather than a criticism. But at the same time, if he’s not willing to change and get his anger under control then you need to be firm. Regardless, I think anger management is a must - my suggestions are only short term strategies for the moment, but he needs to tackle the root cause of his anger (and depression). He needs a professional to guide him through that.

The best approach is to avoid contact with him and avoid things that remind you of him. Return any of his possessions you may have, and get your things back from him (you can bring a friend or relative if you’re not comfortable going alone). I also recommend removing him from social media and deleting his number so you’re not tempted to contact him or trawl his profiles, and deleting any photos of him on your phone.

If you weren’t happy and things weren’t getting better, then you have made the right decision for you. It doesn’t matter if the relationship was 4 weeks, 4 months, 4 years or 4 decades - if it doesn’t work and you’re not happy, you have to do what’s best for you. It’s normal to feel guilty and wonder if you made the right decision. If you ever feel like asking him to come back, remind yourself why you left.

Hope you feel better soon. I emphasise to try and avoid being alone right now, reach out to loved ones!

And if they don’t have properties then to help you find alternative arrangements elsewhere. You absolutely should not be forced to live in such horrible conditions. Hopefully they can help you, but if the landlord doesn’t help, search yourself and get out ASAP. Even if it costs you a bit of money, it’s worth spending to get into a better situation. This is a big reason why I don’t live with others, but I get that’s not feasible in some areas, so if you can, try to view other places before moving in and ask potential roommates what their chore arrangements are so you get a better idea what your next arrangements might be like.

For now, just keep to yourself as often as you can. Get your own toilet paper, and get either disposable gloves or rubber gloves you can easily disinfect. Only clean what you use and don’t do anything for them. I also recommend getting a safe or something to protect your valuables, should you not be able to lock your bedroom (although even if it does, securing items is still worthwhile) - I don’t trust a petty roommate not to mess with things. 

If any of the other roommates are friendlier than the one you confronted, you might have some luck to make things a bit easier in the meantime, but don’t hold out hope. “I’m not expecting a show home, but especially in these times, we should keep to basic hygiene levels. I would appreciate if everyone could clean up after themselves. And if anyone had an issue with supplies, then I’m happy for us to agree upon a budget. I’d like us all to live civilly and I hope we can work this out”. But they sound rather immature and petty.

It’s probably too much hassle for her to think about what needs to be done and then how she should split the chores between you both and finds it easier just to do stuff herself. So don’t make her need to think - if you see something that needs to be done and she’s busy with something else, just do it. Ask your boss for some family time and simply say to your wife “boss has given me X days off”. 

Next, when there’s a moment of calm, ask to talk and ask what support she needs. Don’t discuss it in terms of housework and don’t make suggestions - just say “I want to help support you as I know you’re exhausted and frustrated. How can I best support you right now?” Don’t criticise where she’s gone wrong or mention her getting angry at your daughter. 

I should also note that if you need to let your wife know you’re going to do something, don’t frame it as a favour. So “we’re out of milk, I’ll nip to the shop, want me to grab anything while I’m out?” Rather than “since you’ve been so busy all day, I’ll take some time away from working and do the grocery shopping”. It’s a small difference, but makes a big difference in interpretation. Or if you want to do a bed time one night, say “I’ll tuck her in tonight, I’ve been meaning to *read her X story*/I didn’t realise how long it’s been since I last did it/etc” rather than “you lost it last time you put daughter to bed, so I’ll do it tonight”. 

If things still don’t improve, then she needs to communicate her needs with you - but that’s out of your control. The only person you can control is you, so you can only do what you can to make things better. Good luck, hope things improve."

Just talk to your girlfriend about it! Let her know you love her and miss her, and love talking to her, but you just really struggle with calls. But that you want to try things to make it better for you both. I think the issue for a lot of people is that when you’re in person, you can do things while you chat, but it feels like you have to focus so much more on calls. Not that we don’t pay attention in person; it’s just a lot more relaxed. So try doing things together while you chat. Or you each do your own things - crafting, gaming, drawing, scrolling social media, pampering etc. Something that doesn’t require too much focus to allow you to have conversations, but still gives you a little breathing room.

My best friend and I message each other all the time, but Skype quite regularly too (maybe once a week). We’re both quite introverted and it’s not that we necessarily need conversation, but rather having the presence of someone we care about and are comfortable with. When we are together in person, we can just do our own thing and only pass an occasional word, and it won’t be remotely awkward. So when we need that kind of closeness but aren’t able to meet in person, we will hang out on Skype. Sometimes, we have proper chats. Sometimes, we set up a board game and play together (we each have a copy of the game and move the pieces accordingly). Sometimes, we put on the same show and occasionally pass comment as we watch - I think Netflix has set up an app where you can watch things together from separate locations. We treat is as if we were hanging out in person, rather than a “formal” call.

The important thing is to be open and honest with your girlfriend and try different things. She’ll at least know you enjoy her company and want to talk with her, it’s just the channel of communication that needs adjusting!"

But I reiterate, do this for yourself and not him.

Also, get FDH on board. Tell him his father is being out of line and while you will be saying no, you need him to back you up. Again, don’t waste time trying to convince FFIL why you’ve made this decision, you just need to say no and FDH just needs to say “she’s made her decision dad, stop pushing it”.

Sometimes when people get into new relationships they’re oblivious to everyone around them and just forget to keep in touch. I think if he’d referred to you as a little brother so recently, he must care deep down!

depression,fk70s8k,t3_fgg60t,1583924040.0,"Don’t be nervous about medication! Is it bad for a diabetic to need insulin? Or for someone with high blood pressure to need beta blockers? Depression is an illness, and medication helps to treat the illness! It’s just a little more complicated as this illness is unique to each sufferer, so medication won’t be the same for everyone.

What you should know is it’s not a quick fix. You can feel worse before you feel better, and you may need to try a couple of different medications before you find one that works. I’ve been on a few over the years, with some working for a while before they became ineffective, but I’ve finally found one that’s good. Many people don’t need medication long term, but if long term treatment is what you need then it’s ok! Don’t think of it as needing pills to be happy, but treatment for a chronic illness. But maybe medication won’t work for you, and that’s ok too; work with your doctor. Depression will tell you there’s no point, it won’t work, etc - don’t listen to it.

It’s also not going to be the magic cure to make you happy - it doesn’t do that for me. But what it does do is allow me to function and have the energy to tackle any issues. It could be why therapy hasn’t been working - you’ve not been in the right mindset or had the energy to put the advice into practice. I personally struggle with therapy as I don’t have a set issue to work through, more a constant line of thinking. 

Also remember that recovery isn’t linear, but comes in waves with ups and downs. You will have good times and bad times. It’s especially tough when a bad time strikes after you’ve been doing well, so I understand why you’d feel like giving up. But it’s completely normal and doesn’t mean there’s no hope. As hard as it is, you need to ride the waves and keep an eye out for dry land."

Ultimately it’s your choice, but take care if you get back together with him. Sometimes people will get better temporarily to convince their partner to stay, and then go back to their old ways. So consider being wary and be prepared to go if he returns to his old ways.

Hopefully it’ll turn out as you want and things will be a lot better and you can both be happy. But it’s good to go into this situation prepared for every eventuality and making sure to take care of your mental health and well-being. Good for you for taking this step and best of luck!"
relationship_advice,fjrypl5,t3_feu7dw,1583591570.0,"I would generally recommend ignoring the email, as the moment you respond you become involved. Your brother is the best one to advise. I’d suggest contacting him with a generic “sorry to mention this, but [girl] got in touch to ask what happened. I haven’t replied to her and won’t do so unless you want me to. Would you rather I sent her a brief reply saying I cannot help her, or just continue to ignore her?” That makes it clear you have no intention to mention his past (which you shouldn’t), but let’s him know what’s happening and let’s him choose the response. If you’re relationship is strained right now he may not respond, in which case opt to ignore. If he decides he’d like you to send a brief reply, you can say something like:

“I’m afraid I cannot help you. But if he hasn’t reached out again then I think it’s best for you both to move on. I wish you the best for the future.”

This sounds like an awful situation for your brother and your family. Hopefully therapy will help him and your relationship will improve. I hope he eventually learns that while his ex was troubled, it’s not his responsibility to fix her, and he shouldn’t endure abuse just because of her struggles. If the guilt about not helping her arises, he should know that she wasn’t in a place mentally to be in a relationship and staying wouldn’t have helped her to change - she became reliant on abusing him and the temptation to continue while he was around would’ve been too strong. She needs to work on herself before she is able to pursue a healthy relationship. And your brother needs to take care and focus on himself - and most importantly, forgive himself."

I had to leave my flat and move back in with my parents because unemployment and housing benefits combined only came to 3/4 my monthly rent, never mind other expenses. I can completely understand why it would seem hopeless. But a temp voluntary position lead to a temp paid position and eventually the full-time job I have now. I have a friend who was unemployed for even longer, but she finally found something. It can take a while and hard work, but you can get there. Have you been getting interviews but not getting further? Check out some resources for improving your interview skills. No luck getting interviews? Might be time to refresh that CV. My volunteer position was at my local job centre and it’s amazing how improving CVs and cover letters increased interviews and offers. A common mistake is underselling yourself - we all have a lot more skills and experiences than we would ever give ourselves credit for. My tip is for each previous position, write out everything you ever did there (even if only once), look at the key skills involved and then condense and tidy. If you’re able to get any temporary voluntary work (that wouldn’t put further strain on you financially), that can also help to boost your CV, open doors to potential paid work, and gets you out of the house and into a routine. 

Will things get better? I can’t answer that with certainty. But you can’t know if there is a better life out there if you quit now. Reach out for help (hospital for now for the immediate crisis, then your usual doctor) and take things slowly. If you haven’t looked into it already, you could get temporary medical exemption from working and get yourself time to get used to any medications and get out of a crisis situation (and the appropriate government financial aid) - I don’t know what the rules are for different countries though so you’ll need to research that for your area. Then tackle one thing at a time; work on whatever means the most to you and whatever would make you feel more at peace, whether that’s securing a job, or meeting new friends.

That being said, still prepare for your future (particularly financially). Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and always have a safety net to fall back on. 

Life won’t always be easy, so it’s ok to struggle sometimes - never be afraid to ask for help."

AmItheAsshole,filgu1d,t1_fil65nb,1582501270.0,I think the “does” is referring to the “sucks” part of everyone sucks here (ESH). So commentor is basically saying “everyone sucks here but your son sucks way more than you”
AmItheAsshole,fi83fnw,t3_f6v3ao,1582232716.0,"NTA. I was a very shy child and so desperate to be accepted that I let people walk all over me. I would be bullied but accept it as “just friends having a laugh” because hey, they were spending time with me right? Am I not supposed to be making more friends? I finally made a casual comment to an actual friend, and despite asking her not to, she instantly told my parents. They sorted it out and those people stayed away from me. At first I was pissed off - I was alone again. I also confess that this happened a few times throughout school (I couldn’t handle loneliness). It wasn’t until I was older and encountered actual friends that I realised that was for my own good and I would’ve been miserable if they let the bullying continue. I already have long-lasting mental health and self esteem issues, so I dread to think what it would’ve done if they’d turned a blind eye. So your son may be upset now and may think a bad “friend” is better than none, but he will eventually realise that being surrounded by loving family who look out for his best interests is far better than letting a bully take advantage and his parents turning a blind eye. Let him be angry, he will come around eventually. It’s a great opportunity to highlight self respect and self worth and no company is worth suffering humiliation and bullying."
AmItheAsshole,fhx70jf,t3_f51csk,1581946646.0,"NAH, but I’d recommend talking to her and maybe getting her help (like an internet security course) and make it a temporary arrangement to avoid joint finances. I think work it as an attempt to help and keep you both secure, rather than accusatory and that you don’t trust her (even if that may be true, proceed gently). 

It can happen to any of us. I’ve been through training at work and am very studious with all emails and calls that come to our office (as well as being the go-to when anyone is unsure), but I’ve fallen for a scam before when exhausted (fortunately It was my personal account, I twigged instantly and didn’t lose any money). But it’s worrying that she fell for a second scam so soon after the first. Also tell her that if she gets similar calls in the future, she should say “thank you for bringing this to my attention, I will have my husband look into this” and hang up, then immediately tell you. If it is genuine, you can check your details and fix things - if it’s a scam, then you won’t have lost money. This way she doesn’t need to panic and that you will resolve anything that is genuine."

JUSTNOMIL,fhg7qqe,t3_f2thv9,1581560510.0,"Count this one as a loss. I agree with another commenter in arranging a craft day with her for this project:
“Hey MIL. It was kind of you to bring the supplies, but I’m sure you realise that with 2 little ones I don’t get much free time - I haven’t had a chance to work on any of my other projects, far less starting a new one! But why don’t I ask DH to have a day with the kids and I can come round to yours and we can work on it together?” Bring the things over - if she ends up avoiding that activity, you can just leave them there for “next time”. 

Next time she phones with a craft idea, just say “oh that sounds lovely, can’t wait to see what you make! When I get time, I’m thinking of working on [insert something you want to do]” or “I’m so glad you’re going to do X! I’m taking a little break from crafting as I want to [do Y with the kids/do Z with the family/save up money/etc]”

Try to avoid leaving anything ambiguous and make it clear that you’re not expecting to be involved in her craft ideas. As long as you stay chirpy and positive it won’t come across as rude or mean and be a reasonable boundary."

Women can still breastfeed after reductions. But even if your chances are affected, babies can still be fed with formula! Don’t make yourself suffer for longer than necessary based on theoretical kids that might not appear for years. 

Oh yeah, and your boyfriend can take a hike. Your breasts don’t belong to him and this is for your health. If he’s more interested in how your breasts look than your well-being, then this is not someone you want to consider marrying and having children with at this time."
JustNoSO,fhfmbtu,t3_f2kb7e,1581546340.0,"I want you to imagine that your best female friend came to you to ask advice. What she tells you is exactly what you have written here. What advice would you give her? 

You say you can’t leave because you love him - but love isn’t a reason to stay. And think - do you really love him as things are, or do you love the idea of what he could be if these issues weren’t there? Because as things are, is the love you have for him worth it? 

Driving is a great skill, but I think working on getting a job is more important- but for your own financial security, not to please her. Because like you say, nothing will ever please her, there will always be something else. She has chosen to dislike you, and it’s nothing you’ve done wrong. So don’t waste your energy trying anymore. He has also made his choice - he would rather avoid conflict and give in to his mother, so he will never prioritise you. He’s not willing to work to make things better. As has been said, you can’t change him or his mother - the only thing you control is you. Are you willing to put up with a life of feeling invalidated, alone and betrayed? To be second to his mother? To be accused of being selfish and controlling if you try to make your feelings and wants heard? Because if that’s not the life you want, then the only option is to leave this relationship. 

Maybe he will get out of the fog one day and become a better person. But you can’t stay based on that hope. While you’re in this relationship, he has no incentive to change, so he won’t do it. It’s horrible, and it’s sad. You will miss him. You will think you’ve made a mistake. You will want him back. This is where you need to be strong. Get yourself some counselling (or at least talk to a close friend/relative) and find the self worth that’s been taken from you. It doesn’t mean you were wrong to stay in this relationship for the time you did - I’m sure there have been good points - you’ve just reached a point of incompatibility, and the healthiest choice for you is to leave and start taking care of yourself. Good luck!"
