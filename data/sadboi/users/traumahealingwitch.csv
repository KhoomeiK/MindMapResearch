Trauma only gets the label of PTSD if you happen to see a doctor that diagnoses you with the symptoms. Not having a diagnosis of PTSD does not mean what you endured, and continue to endure, are not valid. The Western medical model of trauma/PTSD only tells a fraction of the story.

I highly recommend reading up on trauma from the perspective of the polyvagal theory. It frames trauma in a bigger, more complete picture, as a function of the nervous system that influences EVERYTHING in your life instead of a ""thing"" that you have. This is a much more actionable take on trauma, imo.

I reacted to rush hour traffic with road rage. This is my trigger. It's ""on me"" in that I am the one that's sensitive to it. It's ""not on me"" in that it isn't my conscious brain deciding to get angry, the road rage ""just"" bubbled out.

starseeds,fqi60ua,t3_giyn6d,1589390874.0,"Starseed or not, we are all here as humans, living a human experience. This is what the Starseed mission is too! To fully understand what it means to be human. The good AND the bad. It's this polarity, this light and dark, push and pull, sorrow and joy that gives us EXPERIENCE.

Because the Starseed mission is to fully understand the human experience, the path is to fully, truly love yourself. Your entire self. Not to condemn one part of you and lock it away. It's to learn to work with, make space for, develop unconditional love of-- ALL of you. You say your human brain and heart likes to expect and attach, and it kills you every time. Do you want to continue rejecting it? What good does that bring you? What if you could learn to love your Shadow, and know how to experience the pain AND be bigger than it?

So you put away your human pain and suffering behind a wall, you seal it off. You point to a part of yourself that says ""this is human, this kills me"". That you get attached too easily, you let your emotions run you, that you can't help it. **Yes you can.** But only if you can see that you are bigger than this. And that is literally part of the work.

No one is saying it's gonna be easy. It's really, really, really hard work. Some believe it takes multiple lifetimes... but all of it is ok, because *that's the point*! The Universe created everything in order to fully understand the answer to one question: ""Who am I?"" This doesn't differentiate between good and bad, all of it just IS. It's not about *finishing the work.* It's about *experiencing the work*. 

We are here so we can EXPERIENCE the answers to this question. Believing that we are powerless, and at the whim of pain and suffering, is part of the human experience. What IS the human experience? It is a multidimensional MIND and SOUL, driving a physical BODY for the purpose of experiencing all that it means to BE a human. You have so much untapped power. It's inaccessible right now because you haven't put in enough of the work yet.. but again, all of this is part of the experience. You know what else is part of the human experience? Empowerment. Transformation. Rebirth. <3"

Arghhh can't remember the phrase but it's called one thing when you ovulate on the New Moon & bleed on the Full, and vice versa. But really, 28 days is just an average cycle length.. so I don't really like this idea... I don't like that someone could potentially think ""what's wrong with me??"" just because you're not bleeding every.full.moon. ya know?

So with that said, one way to look at it is:

Ovulation happens around the middle of the cycle, and you bleed \~2wk after that. Ovulation is the literal start of life, ALL potential. In that way, it's similar to the New Moon. Then the bleed is ""release"", full activation, where you create into the world-- Full Moon. Some people believe that your own bleed is when you're the most potent.

There's some evidence that shows increased light exposure at night affects hormones, which some people (including naturopaths) think is how the idea of bleeding with the Full Moon started (I think? I can't remember exactly) It's also why some people benefit from blackout curtains & eyemasks at night, especially if there's a lot of light pollution in your area.

Not that these people can't also be empathic, but my concern is ""WELP I'm an Empath, that's just why I'm always bitter/ragey/pissy""

I briefly looked up aphantasia. Here are some other ideas for grounding that could work? (of course don't go with ones that could be potentially triggering in some way)

* Describe how the inside of your elbow feels. Then, describe how the inside of your knee feels. Keep adding different areas of the body. Can you feel them all at the same time?
* Name 5 things you physically see with the color blue. Name 5 sounds you can hear in-person. Name 5 different things you feel on your skin right now (like how does the inside of your socks feel? shirt? pants?)
* Coloring books
* Pick one mundane thing.. a leaf, a mug, a pen. Describe it in detail. Pick one adjective per sense.
* Breathing. Can you consciously make it feel like you're sending your breath into your left foot? Right foot? Both? Left ribcage? Right tummy? Upper back? Back of the head?
* Compassionate touch. Like literally finding something that feels good. Some people like putting their hand on their neck, head, etc. Some people feel good literally hugging themselves. Some people respond well to tapping certain parts of the body.
* My favorite, is self-myofascial release aka self-massage. You can use a foam roller, a massage ball, etc. Or even any mobility, yoga, flexibility flow in which you investigate what exactly you feel, where, and doing what."

I'm just saying it's possible to get some things out of your charts, and some maybe's.

I've gotten into a similar issue before, same exact friction. I realized something, and it made me less frustrated at this person: part of why trauma fucks with you so deeply is that there's a moment where you feel helpless to prevent your pain or a belief that you're going to die. This is the thing that BREAKS the belief that you can push through everything. The fact that this break is a *cause* of trauma-- a very deep wound as you know-- means that the belief that ""you can push through everything if you try hard enough"" is just as deep. That person that I got into it with over a similar issue-- I realized she was never going to be able to understand the full extent of this pain. And I'm glad for her. AND I'm frustrated as shit. AND it does amplify the isolation of trauma.

AND I remind myself that I know she loves me, but it is sooo fucking misguided, but that she's always tried her best to support me. I can't blame her for not being able to see a reality that I live in. It hurts, yeah. But I know there's love behind that divide. They're waiting for us to come home; they don't know how they can help bring us back, so they fumble around.

Your frustration & hurt are 100% valid. And the validity of these feelings don't exclude other things. I hope you guys are able to meet in the middle somewhere. Maybe it's a codeword that you say to her when a situation is starting to go bad (exercising boundaries is good for us in general anyways).

>I am tired of being the light for others while they leave me with nothing.

This is important for anyone but especially if you're empathic: PRACTICING BOUNDARIES IS SELF-CARE! Boundaries within ourselves & with others!

I can feel the cogs inside trying to churn, but the system is so rusty, faulty, catches on things, lags, stalls out. And it feels like I'm standing behind this thick glass pane, or like I'm moving underwater.

One thing that my therapist had to push me really hard to do lol but ended up helping a lot, was to step up the physical self-care. The catch was that I had to consciously be ok with doing it. Which meant it wasn't so much ""MAKE yourself do it"", but ""ask yourself if you would give it a try"". This part is important because part of trauma is feeling helpless, like you have no say-- so ""just making yourself do it"" doesn't help because it's similar.. a part of you clearly doesn't want to, so why keep forcing it? Try again later!

Over time, that helped relieve this issue (as well as other symptoms).. not entirely though. If I'm consistent about it, I definitely feel more ""on"" overall. If I get off track more than a few days, it starts creeping back. And there's no direct cause & effect, it's not like ""ohhh yeahh I'm journaling and I can FEEL my thinking getting better!"". It's like taking an antibiotic or something.. you feel miserable because of whatever infection, so you take the antibiotic & over time it starts working but it's not like you actually feel it.

These kinds of self-care things can be journaling (I recommend GUIDED journaling because it can be way too easy to get hooked by a negative thought that you end up writing about because.. what else would you journal about?), better sleep hygiene, practice feeling inside your body (literally try to feel how the inside of one part of your body feels, describe it with adjectives, see how another part feels, describe that with adjectives, and then see if you can be fully experiencing all of those adjectives in both areas), deep breathing & visualizing that you're ""breathing in"" to different areas of your body, art or even some coloring books (or even some color by numbers!)."

ptsd,fph231t,t3_gddt0n,1588613598.0,"How would you tell your story if you viewed it through the lens of self-kindness?

Maybe--

Maybe as a child in early high school, you figured out on your own that the only way you could possibly get through the days, get through high school & college requirements and all the unique difficulties of that time and age, was to put up a wall around the pain that you knew would be absolutely debilitating otherwise. So much pain, that you would just fall apart if you let it splay out. So just grit your teeth and keep pushing on, put up those walls to keep it at bay. No. Matter. What. Any leaks in the wall, you plug it up with more determination, more resistance. Just.. KEEP FIGHTING IT. Fortify those walls.

You already know there is no long-term peace in that. You must be exhausted. But how could you have known better? You were so young, and it's not like someone sat you down & explained all of the layers of trauma and PTSD. No one can fault you for what you don't know, and anyway, people are only just now understanding the depths of trauma. Maybe you even had a constant reminder or trigger for your trauma that you couldn't get away from, which probably meant whatever was behind those walls continued to grow as you had more that you had to keep at bay.

We react to reminders of our pain. It's like a warning system when your thoughts are getting too close to that wall, because whatever is behind that wall is UNTOUCHABLE. It's itself painful. You said it yourself, you forced yourself to get through it, in the only way you knew how.. and to see everyone else just putting it all out there? Wait, they didn't wall it all up? I pushed through it, why couldn't they??

Having trauma means you have intense pain inside. Made all the more painful by shutting away from it. The human mind is really resourceful and amazing, but it's not perfect-- it's totally understandable to build up a system that you view the outside world through in the same way we view our inside world.. it's just that we're so used to being in our own heads that a lot of things blend into the background and it takes a LOT of work to actually SEE it.

I think this was really strong, brave, and self-aware of you to post this. I think this a sign of a new step in your healing. It will be hard.. after all, how do you release what's behind those walls in a way that you don't get swept up in what comes crashing out?

Know that this is ENTIRELY POSSIBLE! Day by day-- and it sounds like you're already on that next step, noticing that you're getting triggered when you get these reminders from others. How do you relate to those thoughts? Do you get swept up in the anger, judgement? Is there a way you can note it, and see it for what it is-- that it's not YOU?"

witchcraft,fped8rd,t3_gcp77g,1588545224.0,"I totally feel you on this! I vet sellers on Instagram. I follow them for a while to get an idea of the type of business they're running before I even think about speding money. Most of these sellers go to the major gem shows and/or buy from the mine dealers (?)

If the seller isn't able to tell me the specific area they buy from, and don't interact with the people that are directly connected to the mine, AND can't answer my questions about the source, I don't buy. Instagram sellers usually sell via Instagram lives, private shopping by DM (if it's not a huge page), and/or Story & Feed sales.

It's definitely about trust between you as the client & the seller, as well as the seller from the mine. It's really hard to buy direct from mine especially if it's not bulk, and especially if you're not going to gem shows.

Some sellers that I can recommend: littlelemuriagems, organicpunkrocks, chasingluster & moonbodysoul (isn't focused only on crystals but she is the most focused/outspoken about supporting disadvantaged populations.. I have some citrine that she got from a women-run mine in Zambia.. not to say that others haven't sourced their citrine from that mine)

Sometimes I watch crystal mining videos on YT and it just breaks my heart to see how much they're fucking with the earth. I saw some mine in Peru where the miners use mercury with their bare hands :(  I have really mixed feelings because for some people, this is their only way to make a living. Bleh."

CPTSD,fpaukdi,t3_gc82v8,1588456011.0,"I like that analogy! My somatic experiencing therapist described it to me like this:

Imagine you're stuck in the parking garage of a building. This space is total shutdown, dissociation. The goal isn't to be able to get & stay to the penthouse (because that's not great either). It's to create a new home, somewhere in the middle.. not too low, not too high. But in order to BUILD capacity-- you can't have the room of the penthouse without building the walls around it first. It's definitely a new experience for sure.

Something else to keep in mind is definitely ramp up your self-care, practicing anchoring & making space around those difficult things! You can only push through so much difficulty before your system says ""this is enough right now"" & it's important to honor that. The last thing you'd want is to push through with so much resistance, pushing through your system's messages saying ""too much right now"", to have it send you back to shutdown/dissociation. I've experienced improvements, but goddamn it's hard to stop pushing when you've had a lifelong conditioning of ""PUSH HARDER! NEVER GIVE UP!"""

energy_work,fp0qmsm,t1_fp0nvyf,1588214780.0,"Have you worked on any strengthening with the physio? The foam rolling & all those other passive modalities (including acupuncture) can only do so much. They help create more space, but if we don't install a different (hopefully better) pattern of movement, it will just keep reverting back. And the way to ""install"" a different movement pattern is by actually DOING it, strengthening. And it's not so much ""raw strength"" as it is self-disciplined, highly-focused strength, aka mobility. (also sorry, can you clarify what PL is?) Usually, starting those exercises is suupperrr hard because you're literally trying to move in a way that has never occurred to your brain & nervous system before-- which means it's super easy to do wrong, and really hard to do right. That's one of the benefits of having someone right there with you, making all those little microadjustments that all of a sudden make it seem like 20 times harder lol

Injuries in the same spot are usually flare-ups of previous injuries.. I've come to view them as a message that says ""you need to improve this!""

That was actually one of the parts I struggled with the most, I don't know enough about the chakras to be able to understand much more than what he said. I guess what I could extract from that in particular-- I do kind of have an idea that the human chakras correspond with different areas of the body, so I wonder if figuring out which of your chakras is disrupted can help show you what you need to work on next... like an indicator or a flag. I'm really just wondering out loud at this point lol

I do think there are things to pull out and apply to living our lives (if that's what you mean by extract a way of life). Recognizing that we're all of the same thing, loving others unconditionally. That we're all here to experience our lives in our own unique way and that it's all valid in some way. This can relieve some of the suffering that comes from resisting something so much that this suffering becomes our entire reality. (Been working on this myself lately, making more space for pain & accepting it isn't a justification of it)

For me though, this starts to run into the idea of good/bad, right/wrong. There ARE bad things that happen to us as humans, and if we are here to experience everything- if we're supposed to fully live and experience life, then our beliefs about good/evil ARE valid from our perspective. I could totally go back & forth on this.. lol

Anyway, I do see what you mean about the dubiousness!"

energy_work,foz9jym,t3_ga9jgd,1588186951.0,"Hey there! I am a mobility coach. So here are my 2 cents:

Our nervous system is influenced by, and influences, our state. It's like the bridge between our mind and our physical bodies. Yes, you could be storing inter-generational trauma. Yes, trauma can be manifested in the physical body. Yes, stress (ANY kind of stress, including exercise) can be stored in the body.

It makes sense. When your system recognizes that you are not in an environment where you can truly relax and be safe and social, your nervous system will prime you to be protective. For some people, that means keeping muscles tight as if you're about to brace for something.

It sounds like you've tried a lot of the things I typically recommend in terms of physical work. And just to clarify, have you worked with self-myofascial release, is that what you meant by muscle work? (like foam roller, massage ball, peanut massage ball)

What kind of movement practices do you do, besides running & swimming? Are you stretching by doing static/passive stretches only?

Approaching this issue from another perspective would be looking at developing mental tools to help your entire system understand that you are more than this. It's the idea that resistance creates more suffering, so letting go of resisting will lessen the suffering. (very much easier said than done though)

Also keep in mind that our bodies are continually receiving input, and reacting to continued stimuli. Like if you're constantly in an environment that causes stress, then working on massage an hour everyday can help but not solve the issue entirely. But this isn't to say you have to escape the situation; you can put in the work to know how to make space for the difficulties, while realizing that you have an entire world around this.

It is NEVER TOO LATE."
