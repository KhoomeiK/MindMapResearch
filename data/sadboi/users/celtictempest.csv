magicTCG,f1lihws,t3_d9urnf,1569555748.0,"There is no ""official count."" However, accepted analysis of deck design and probability statistics would argue that it is (almost) always best to play the minimum number of cards allowed. Long story short, you want to maximize your chances of drawing a given card at the appropriate time of the game. Drawing the 61st card you choose to include on a given turn is most likely worse than drawing the 60th card you decided to include. 

Essentialy, playing the minimum number of cards maximizes your chances of seeing the card you want in any given situation because you have less extra cards to deal with. Very simplistic explanation but gets at the main point."
depression,ey3zgau,t3_cves26,1566777801.0,"Those days when you feel like you might be just doing this for attention when there are other ""people who really need to be noticed and loved"" are just the days when your brain is fighting you the most. Depression is a crafty adversary and uses our perceptions against us. 

Thank you for making the effort to reach out to this community. It is really difficult to breach the walls we (in large part due to depression etc) have constructed to isolate others from exposure to our burdens (I'm talking about ppl with depression firmly believing we are bothersome to others and should be able to handle our own shit without annoying them). The fact is, we are all in this together and those who love you (and strangers who can understand) will always have your back!"
