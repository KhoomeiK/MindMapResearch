JRPG,fdadim4,t3_ek9j9x,1578244825.0,Atelier.

FinalFantasy,fctzy9y,t1_fctoylf,1577967641.0,"No not really, but I mean, I’d still rather see it for myself."
FinalFantasy,fct8tpu,t1_fct8jis,1577935950.0,There’s more than that... I’ve seen things that shouldn’t even be in part 1. I want to go back in time and smash my phone now.
FFVIIRemake,fct8kyr,t3_eisix3,1577935757.0,"Yeah, actually I think I’m just gonna leave this subreddit until every single part of the remake is out... So basically never again is what I’m saying."
FFVIIRemake,fcr8yft,t3_eik7nb,1577898499.0,You can hear the sound of my heart shattering into a million pieces.
Megaten,fcov4e9,t3_ei8oav,1577842403.0,Drink more water first...
FFVIIRemake,fcmxs3s,t3_ei0vzb,1577796898.0,I really don’t care what all it is. I JUST NEED SOMETHING!!!!
FFVIIRemake,fc87f1j,t3_eggq8a,1577528549.0,"Knowing SE, they probably would do something like that."
rareinsults,fbikkg8,t1_fbi9t18,1576903838.0,I hate myself for falling for this...
depression,fbg159h,t3_eczhm3,1576829199.0,"Yeah... Ok, screw your family and go see your friend."
FFVIIRemake,f8xn5zp,t1_f8vp9v3,1574924826.0,Which technically broke with FFXV.
FFVIIRemake,f1c48b7,t3_d8oene,1569349542.0,I really regret pre-ordering it digitally now...
FFVIIRemake,f0fejbe,t3_d4plyc,1568582118.0,Their attention to detail is incredible.
FinalFantasy,f0enly2,t3_d4mf58,1568570893.0,Nice to see you here.
danganronpa,f08n1io,t3_d43vx6,1568483993.0,Nice disguise Junko.
FFVIIRemake,f06cl57,t3_d40hzr,1568434868.0,I just want to play that demo.
JRPG,f04xd6w,t3_d3nmw8,1568397806.0,Currently going through Nocturne and good lord is it dark and nihilistic. Not to mention kinda hard... Or maybe I’m just not grinding enough.
danganronpa,ezmh1vd,t3_d1fqya,1567991800.0,I did not realize how wrong this sounded out of context until you just pointed it out...
PERSoNA,ezlsjnp,t3_d19srw,1567980963.0,I always just use the canon name.
Megaten,ez10kd2,t3_czroxd,1567644178.0,What about TGS?
Megaten,eyutecm,t3_cyosw8,1567471649.0,Guilty as charged.
Persona5,ey1rr4h,t1_ey1ns7h,1566708776.0,The Royal Ending.
Persona5,ey0qhdt,t1_ey0pgjf,1566681947.0,I honestly hope the series returns one day. Maybe finally get to see all of those episodes that were never released because of the show’s cancellation. I read about the planned 3 part series finale that was planned a long time ago and it sounded amazing. So it would be really cool to see it actually happen.
Persona5,ey0p9dt,t1_ey0orky,1566681632.0,I was fine with the ending. It ended like any other Zim episode and after all this time... It’s all I could’ve really asked for. Plus it does leave room for more to come should Jhonen feel up to it.
Persona5,ey0myt5,t1_ey0mky0,1566680922.0,"Of course! Invader Zim was my childhood shit growing up. No way I was missing out on the movie. It was really amazing and kept the same charm the original series had. The new animation also, while I prefer the old animation the new is also really good."
FinalFantasy,ey0m5ez,t1_ey0lnkz,1566680640.0,Oh ok. I see. Thanks.
Persona5,ey0lpyg,t3_cut1b7,1566680600.0,I love that this is a meme.
FinalFantasy,ey0kund,t1_ey0jq71,1566680226.0,Nope. Still not working for me.
nier,ey06zie,t1_exzm5m3,1566675258.0,If the character creation does go that deep which it would be awesome if it does.
FinalFantasy,ey06rt7,t3_cuung6,1566675171.0,I couldn’t find it in the PS Store.
Persona5,excvee7,t1_exciakw,1566160555.0,I almost exploded in laughter reading both of these.
nier,ex028uo,t1_ex01x0j,1565903895.0,Yeah. Also as much as I love A2 and as much as I’d love to see her in Smash I think 2B is more likely than her unfortunately.
nier,ex01rq3,t1_ex011er,1565903713.0,Alright. Fair point.
nier,ex00ljr,t1_ex00e1o,1565903258.0,FF7 is on Switch and Joker is in Persona Q2. A 3DS game. Yes that counts.
nier,ewzutdj,t1_ewzufsh,1565901053.0,True. But I think if anyone as sexy as Bayonetta can be in Smash then I think A2 can too. The only problem I see is that Nintendo only allows characters into Smash that are on their platform. The solution for that would be to bring Automata to Switch.
nier,ewzodjw,t1_ewz70cq,1565898458.0,*Ahem* Bayonetta.
FinalFantasy,ewu287z,t3_cq45dy,1565761489.0,Prepare to cry... Alot.
nier,ewtzdrh,t3_cq2mqa,1565758556.0,Perfection.
JRPG,ewjw5e9,t3_cokswb,1565472851.0,"I don’t know if it counts but, Drakengard 3... Good lord that lag."
nier,ew96vah,t3_cn9x7m,1565220571.0,Persona style Nier spin-off when?
nier,ew8cwlc,t1_ew7e3lf,1565207688.0,You mean like you?
Megaten,ew5dkr7,t3_cmtitz,1565133685.0,You’re asking the difficult questions here.
cyberpunkgame,ew3iab4,t1_ew2knd3,1565080297.0,For a minute?
Megaten,ew3a4ar,t3_cmjsub,1565069566.0,One thing’s for sure.... That ain’t working.
FFVIIRemake,evzmaix,t3_clx815,1564961326.0,I pre-ordered it as soon as the “pre-order now” message popped up on the E3 stream.
FFVIIRemake,eums304,t3_cgvywp,1563919736.0,Get over it.
FinalFantasy,eumrms0,t3_cgu0ws,1563919569.0,Type-0 and Crystal Chronicles.
FinalFantasy,eud28rz,t3_cfw5zj,1563697413.0,Why is this becoming a trend?
FinalFantasy,euad3a3,t3_cfaq9d,1563612105.0,XIII. I never get tired of that transition.
FFVIIRemake,euacjxi,t3_cf76bg,1563611296.0,I just played this today and it’s unbelievably great.
FinalFantasy,eu6x99n,t3_cf33zi,1563511422.0,I think they said that it goes up to the escape from Midgar so probably yes.
FinalFantasy,eu0mpda,t1_eu0m9mc,1563351021.0,More like the entirety of Crisis Core.
etika,etq6tmg,t1_etq09jk,1563074432.0,Private. Can’t see it.
FinalFantasy,et0yrft,t3_c9n9kr,1562389152.0,Hell House could be a boss rather than a normal encounter?
cyberpunkgame,ernq4sh,t3_c2w1uv,1561058514.0,Dead.
FFVIIRemake,erj64eb,t3_c2anj4,1560916879.0,If they did that then they wouldn’t have had to have split the game in parts.
cyberpunkgame,erig83a,t3_c25jie,1560896879.0,I think the gameplay demo and the new trailer can answer that question for you.
FFVIIRemake,erifxwg,t3_c28l97,1560896678.0,It would be nice... But it probably won’t happen.
FinalFantasy,ergkv3e,t3_c1y78g,1560844372.0,That interview was 4-5 years ago. They better stay true to their word.
FFVIIRemake,er9v42z,t3_c10zau,1560630514.0,"Well I mean... I’d rather not have it be a PS5 exclusive but, if that ends up being the case there’s really nothing I can do about it. I’ll just have to start setting money aside for a PS5 now."
FinalFantasy,er3u0re,t3_c00sf2,1560472667.0,I’m just paying attention to the amount of detail on her fingers.
FFVIIRemake,er3tcun,t3_c0czgy,1560472153.0,It would be cool if in the remake you were flying through that vortex and charging at Sephiroth. I kinda picture it being like FFXV Noctis vs Ardyn flying all over Insomnia but better. More importantly though I wonder what the final showdown is going to look like.
FFVIIRemake,er36qh1,t1_er2l9w1,1560457003.0,It really depends on how long it takes them to release each part if they’re wanting to put each part on PS4 still.
FFVIIRemake,eqtj62d,t3_bzm6dg,1560312697.0,Just a bit. I’m excited and all for the remake but I really wish I could see FFXVI.
FFVIIRemake,eqt65ou,t3_bzkyvy,1560303263.0,I guess I’m okay now. I’ve just accepted it as it is what it is.
FinalFantasy,eqt1egu,t3_bzkcjb,1560299499.0,"I think they are really overcomplicating this project. All I really ever wanted was FFVII but with fully HD 3D environments, voice acting, and action combat but I think they are going way too overboard with it."
FFVIIRemake,eqsn8p1,t1_eqsj5e9,1560288845.0,Maybe because people actually want to play through the whole story before they die?
FFVIIRemake,eqqmha7,t3_bz71re,1560224995.0,What I want to know is do I have to buy a next gen system just to finish the damn thing? Cause if so then just forget it. I don’t want to pay thousands of dollars just to finish a remake of a 20 year old game.
FFVIIRemake,eqgt1vb,t3_byd129,1560042117.0,My brain is broken now from reading this.
FFVIIRemake,eq4ybrc,t1_eq4w8ni,1559788852.0,That would be dumb of them and plus I’d be severely disappointed.
FinalFantasy,epa4inh,t3_bu99x5,1559121747.0,If the series should last that long up to that point I’d hope up to FFXXX.
FFVIIRemake,ep43v76,t1_ep43pxs,1559033307.0,That’s just what I always called it.
FFVIIRemake,ep3uygq,t3_btvvfr,1559029071.0,I wanna see Cloud and Barret’s bro date.
FFVIIRemake,eom7nvm,t1_eom50b0,1558683380.0,Some people can be sensitive sometimes.
