Ok, let me justify it.

As I type one diabetic myself, I know how hard it is to deal with the condition, especially through adolescence and early adulthood, and neglecting it can lead to a consistent high blood sugar. Consistent high blood sugar is unhealthy, putting stress on the body, and causes intense unconditional thirst, as well as sometimes a constant, awful mood (I've found), where without reason, you blow up. It sounds like to me, your daughter is having a hard time dealing with her condition, and could be so volatile because of high blood sugar, which would explain her drinking milk so much, because of her thirst and her outbursts.

On the other hand, this is not your fault, and it's not fair for you to deal with the fallout of her neglect. I'm not sure as to suggest what to do - it's not in my place to say, but I would try to involve a therapist or a medical professional to help her control her diabetes, if that is indeed the issue."

AmItheAsshole,f05qh7w,t1_f04bcx4,1568416732.0,"She'd been on and off with this guy from what I'd heard, so I wanted to assure there was no cheating, with my friend, to make sure he didn't end up hurt."
AmItheAsshole,f05qd7q,t1_f037glh,1568416643.0,"The character flaw isn't that she wasn't into me, but the way she dealt with the situation. There was an overlap of taking yeah."
AmItheAsshole,f05q8et,t1_f037thf,1568416539.0,"Thanks, this is what I'm trying to set straight, I never said that she was cheating, only making sure she wasn't. There was however, a 6 week talking flirting overlap."
AmItheAsshole,f05q4ow,t1_f03plsh,1568416457.0,"Hey, I'm not saying she was cheating at any point, only saying she was leading 2 people on, but I do agree with you."
AmItheAsshole,f05py8a,t1_f02y5vi,1568416314.0,"I wasn't doing it for her, but more for the mutual friend who might get hurt from it. I wasn't intending to fuck it up, only to let my friend know what had happened."
AmItheAsshole,f05pojn,t1_f02xq3g,1568416101.0,"Once again, nah. I wasn't being a dick, I wanted to make sure she hadn't been with him while flirting with me. I told him what happened because he asked, and certainly didn't gloat."
AmItheAsshole,f05plpr,t1_f02xe2x,1568416040.0,"Nah, I was originally a bit bitter ofc, but the way she dealt with the situation is what annoyed me, not her disinterested."
AmItheAsshole,f05piyt,t1_f02skgc,1568415981.0,"Note the quotation marks, man. That shouldn't be the one thing you're picking out in this?"
AmItheAsshole,f05pgpr,t1_f049u6i,1568415933.0,"Just for context here, less than 12 hours after, not a week. I only found out from a friend a week after. I'm not accusing her of cheating, just being very unloyal, I think, leading on two guys at once."
