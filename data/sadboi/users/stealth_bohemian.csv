Lexapro 20 mg - depression and anxiety

Wellbutrin XL 300 mg - depression and anxiety

Losartan 100 mg - hypertension
 
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg - hypertension 

Iron - iron deficiency 

Vitamin D - vitamin D deficiency (more in winter for seasonal depression)

Ibuprofen 800 mg 2 - 3 times per day - rotator cuff tendonitis and lower back tendonitis and/or slipped disk, plus headaches from blood pressure fluctuations

Background: depression, anxiety, long term back problems, problems with knees, hips, and wrists. Doc tested me for fibromyalgia and supposedly the test was negative, though he was using a type of test that's coming into question by some medical professionals, so I'm not 100% convinced. 

Good or bad?  The psych meds, eh, maybe both. They may need some adjustments. The other stuff, doing good. I hate to make adjustments since I've learned to deal with the side effects well enough. (Dry mouth, dry cough, variety of gastric issues, insomnia, appetite ups and downs, fatigue, worsening of tinnitus ... the occasional muscle twitches can be mildly entertaining sometimes,  though.)"

I seriously think this is some kind of gender division thing. Lame."

mentalillness,ffxf0j9,t3_evoymq,1580323815.0,"I talked to my doctor about the same thing, partially because two of my three kids have a diagnosis of ADHD, plus my sister had it when she was a kid, my mom thinks my dad might have it as well. My doctor doesn't think I have it, but that's based on the fact that he's under the impression that it would have been diagnosed when I was a kid. However, ADHD diagnoses in general were not all that common when I was a kid, so I'm not so sure about that. The major thing that my doctor told me is that Wellbutrin is actually also used off-label to treat ADHD, so the fact that I was having these symptoms while on Wellbutrin, made it less likely that they were exclusively related to ADHD, so he upped my dose of Lexapro since I was already on the maximum dose of Wellbutrin. Supposedly those executive functioning problems can also be symptoms of depression, at least according to my doctor, so that's something worth considering I guess. I'm sorry I can't say anything that's actually helpful, but I can definitely relate to your situation. If you do find something that helps more, I would certainly love to hear about it myself, because I could use a a little more focus and memory in my life, too."
