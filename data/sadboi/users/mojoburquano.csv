CoronavirusRecession,fl5wku3,t3_fmj8kw,1584847600.0,"I work in mortgage financing. While I can work from home, I haven’t been. Honestly we’ve been so busy this last couple of weeks I haven’t had a chance to hoard, sanitize, or even really think about what the next month might bring. I’m glad that I can be helpful in some small way. This is a good time for people with equity to pull it out as an emergency cushion. Or just refinance so they can skip a couple of mortgage payments.

I’m hopeful that this crisis can shine some light on wealth distribution in the US. Plenty of my borrowers are waitresses and construction workers. They are absolutely fucked. One of my childhood friends is 2weeks our from closing on her first house, but she’s a bartender, and when the loan underwriter asks for her last paycheck stub I’m afraid she’s going to loose her loan, and her house. 

I’ll be working from home the next few weeks, but my boyfriend works in auto repair which is also a necessary industry. Sheltering in place is off of the table, so we’re going to be exposed. But at least we’ll still have insurance when we get sick."

DeathByMillennial,f8hb96k,t1_f8gejjl,1574572083.0,"In think the mortgage industry is part of the problem. I’m a MLO and the low end of the market is largely ignored. I see loans under $300k, but we’re not advertising to those folks. 

What I do see a lot of are loans with 3.5% down that’s the minimum) 45% debt to income (doesn’t leave a lot left to save or live on). 

People are told that a home is a solid investment and i is, except that the market is wildly inflated. There are a variety of reasons. I’m not an economist and I don’t want to get out of my lane, so I can only speak to what I see in my economy. 

What I see is that the current low interest rates are driving up prices in the lower end on the market. First time home buyers are competing with investors for the fixer uppers and the “rental size” 2&3 bedrooms that would have been starter homes if more financially established types weren’t able to buy them at 3 something % looking at 5% appreciation outside of any improvements or rental income. 

Outside of that the federal mortgage tax credit creates this “carrot” to save on your taxes if you own a home. That savings drives up demand/inflates home prices and makes it so you have to be above the mean income in your community AND super frugal to afford anything liveable. 

The housing market is a fucking mess."

Prepare for your dog to have some behavior changes as he adjusts to a new place. Like don’t be surprised if he chews things, even if he didn’t used to. 

I don’t consider having my dog with me a choice. Of course I also got a much smaller dog because it’s hard enough at 35lbs.
