Do at your own risk..... You may also be able to swing both... Talk to the post office and tell them you already committed to a 2 month position at a summer camp because you thought you didn't get the job. Ask them if they would allow you to start after the summer job. You can say something like I really want to honor my commitments but I also don't want to give up the opportunity with usps. It took them two months to offer it to you they maybe ok with starting later. They are always going to need people.
Also if they are OK with this keep in contact with them during this time. So that they know your actually going to follow through. Like an email every few weeks and see if you can do any paperwork ahead of time.
