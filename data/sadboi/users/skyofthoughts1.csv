birthcontrol,fr4xq9f,t3_gmiunn,1589898861.0,"Not familiar with Alesse. Is is a combo pill? I took a combo pill called tri-sprintec in the US. It affected my mood greatly, terribly. After 10 years I stopped the pill and it is amazing how much better I feel. I can look at situations with clarity and actually stand back from how I am feeling to observe what is happening. Never thought those were things I could do! Being off of the pill has been great for me mentally. 

I have had to switch to an IUD called kyleena now for birth control methods especially because I do not regularly ovulate. I just got it put in yesterday though so I can't tell you how it will go, but my Nurse Practitioner says her patients love it and seems to think it will be a good fit for me as the hormones are a lower dose, more localized, and don't enter the bloodstream like the pill does."
birthcontrol,fr4wlpy,t3_gmgegs,1589898257.0,"Everyone's body reacts differently. From what my Nurse Practitioner had told me, IUDs have localized hormones only in the reproductive organs while the pill enters your bloodstream. I had extremely adverse mental effects from taking the pill. For this reason she suggested Kyleena IUD (again, hormones localized, very low dose, does not enter bloodstream) and I'm trying it out. Currently on day two."
birthcontrol,fr4w7jc,t3_gmny6y,1589898046.0,"I dont have great skin to begin with.. it's combination oily and I'm prone to some breakouts.. most of this was controlled by the pill, which I stopped taking in January for mental health reasons.. by March I started getting more and more acne and my skin quality was pretty crummy/getting noticeably worse particularly along my jaw line...for now I kept my routine the same but have been using those little tubes of benzoyl peroxide to spot treat. 

I have a friend who uses Averr Aglow skin care system and I've seen her before/after photos. The results are great after a couple months of consistent usage. It might be worth investing more money in your skin care if that is available to you.

I'm not ready to drop that kind of dough so I just buy the little 5 dollar tube of pimple cream and use it a couple times a day on problem areas and makes sure to moisturize to counteract the drying. It has improved my skin for sure.

You could also ask your doc about other acne medications."

I had a lot of stress going on with both me and my partner. And I've been ridiculously preoccupied with my own problems and he his own so we have been butting heads alot thereby creating more problems. I stopped birth control pill for mental health reasons only to find out that I don't appear to get a period on my own and that one of my testosterone levels is very slightly elevated. My gynecologist says she does not think I am a candidate for PCOS and imaging would be the only way to tell. I had to go back on the pill to try to regulate my cycle but the mental ramifications were absolutely terrible and now she has given me the okay to stop taking it and I will be trying an IUD (Kyleena) to help me. All of this to say that I've been extremely bloated and have had a very odd appetite where I seem to only be drawn to bread, processed cheese, peanut butter, oats, and bananas for the most part. I could hardly eat at all last week and then over the weekend I stuffed myself silly to the point I felt I needed to vomit from being so full. Fortunately I didn't get sick. I guess my body was demanding food from me because my appetite had been so wonky from the new meds I didn't eat much at all during the week. I also am finally taking a break from exercise this week after 6 months at IE. I seem to have tweaked something in my back/butt and my primary care doc has me on anti-inflammatory pills to try to reduce the obnoxious pain. I will only be doing yoga here and there and taking light walks if I have time as opposed to my daily routine that typically consists of AT LEAST 2 physical activities. I'm holding so much water weight from the birth control pills and I'm accepting that whatever happens with my body during this transitional phase will be very worth it in exchange for my mental and physical health to know my uterus is safe (lol) and my emotional well being is manageable. I'm working on letting go and understanding I can't control most things. That's a big one."

EatingIntuitively,fouweaz,t1_fouq8fw,1588091502.0,"It's OK to recognize that some people do have foods that trigger a binge because they have labeled it as ""bad."" However, it's important to realize food has no inherent moral value and usually once you stop labeling a food as off limits and give yourself true unconditional permission to eat it, the desire to binge on it goes away. 

Also planning meals is totally okay because it can be really helpful if you have a busy lifestyle to have things planned out and prepared ahead of time. I always meal plan for work so that I have enough to satisfy me throughout the day and don't have to scramble to get something together or spend a bunch of money on takeout. But meal planning with the intention of limiting food is not in line with IE principles."

That's actually quite normal to be feeling how you are. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself to rest. It does suck being fatigued constantly, but honor it and it will pass in time.

Made me defensive for 2 reasons. 1) because I felt food competition then that I would not get as much as I wanted even though there is a whole other frozen pizza in the freezer if I truly wanted more and 2) because I felt attacked that frozen pizza is a ""bad"" food and should I even be eating it then? Compounded by the fact that he said he added extra cheese and pepperoni which kicked im my worries about not being able to control what I am eating even though rationally I know it is not a big deal.

It started a huge argument. Terrible argument. All because I was defensive. I want to work on being more aware of these triggers and work on stopping my defensive reactions to them. Didn't help that I accidentally got too hungry because I was so immersed in work. Very sad that I let that happen. Going to work on forgiving myself for being human and try to address the underlying issues at play. I am still really proud of how far I have come even though I made a mistake.

@mikazon on Instagram has a HIIT30 program designed for all bodies that is specifically HAES. I have not personally tried it but I hear good things.

I mostly rely on free youtube videos, especially Yoga with Adriene, as someone already mentioned. I've recently been getting into HIIT stuff with Trainer Kaitlin on youtube (also on instagram) because her videos are geared towards getting in shape (as in being physically fit, not LOOKING physically fit). Her workouts are usually a great combo of cardio and strength and don't need a bunch of equipment or can be done with modifications. She does a Sunday Sweatpant Abs series so lots of resources focusing on core strengthening. I love that it keeps me in shape so I can be ready to go back to playing the sports I love once stay at home orders end.

If you have any dumbells or kettlebells at home you could also try weight lifting. I started with [this routine](https://www.building-muscle101.com/dumbbell-workout-beginner/) until I got a little bored after about 2 months of it and started doing Frankomen's Dumbell Only Split (Google search will give you the workout). I have 5 lb, 10 lb, and 30 lb dumbells which is enough for me to do most things as a beginner (although I will eventually need to purchase some 15s and 20s). The great thing about doing new workouts from home is that is gives you plenty of time to go at your own pace and do what makes you feel comfortable. Plus it's highly convenient!"

Like if your ultimate goal is to love your body but you can't even imagine that or you struggle to get there think of something you truly believe right now instead of pretending you all of a sudden love it. I personally find the concept really relatable. I want to love my body but I'm not there yet so I say things like ""I appreciate my body for carrying me through life and allowing me to breathe, see, smell, and feel nature, to hold loved ones, to experience life"" (notice none of that had an emphasis on my body's appearance). Another common example targeted towards specific body parts would be ""this is a human stomach"" with a ladder thought of ""this is my stomach,"" ""my stomach makes it possible to nourish and fuel my body"" with the ultimate goal of ""I love my little belly"" or something to that effect.

EatingIntuitively,fmzsyy4,t3_fy0nq3,1586528905.0,"I believe it is possible to navigate having a medical condition with specific dietary limitations and eat intuitively.  My mom has had type 2 diabetes for my entire lifetime and she has always been an intuitive eater. She does have to be more attentive than most people to what she eats, and while there are foods she really enjoys that she has to limit, she still allows herself to have them every so often. These foods include things like white baking potatoes and ice cream. Usually she buys ""carb smart"" ice cream so she can have it without worrying about spiking her blood sugar. And she usually only gets a baked potato when she goes out to eat as a treat. She also is sure to check her blood sugar often to be sure she is balancing things correctly.  And of course, she regularly visits the endocrinologist to make sure her blood sugar levels and medication are being regulated properly. If it is available to you, I would see if you can find an HAES or IE dietitian who would be adequately informed to help you navigate a plan that works for you personally. A specialist is a good option as well, but a dietitian specializes in food, of course! The biggest thing I see with my mom is that she is ok with making compromises so that she doesn't have to feel like it is all or nothing."

EatingIntuitively,fmtg6qy,t3_fx9pzq,1586372165.0,"Your explanation of mimicing your typical once a week social meal makes sense to me honestly. 

I haven't ""eaten out"" at all myself since my state government began advising to limit contact with others. Sounds like you haven't either, and that you're literally missing that aspect of your routine as you say you used to eat out once a week or so. Maybe order some pizza, delivery, or takeout one night just to mix things up and give yourself a break from cooking three meals a day? A lot of places are offering contactless delivery. 

Also, it's a lot to be home with the family all day. Maybe you just feel that you finally have a moment to yourself to be free and eat and do what you want without having to worry about what your husband or child wants. So it's quite a normal reaction to feel the way you are I think. 

Also food competition (i.e., your son always wanting to share) is listed in the IE book as something that can disrupt our intuitive eating rhythm. Just something to consider! I strongly dislike sharing food or dishes with others because it makes me feel like I have to compete to get my share which usually results in eating more food more quickly than I typically would want.

Perhaps scheduling some alone time can help with all of this? Explain to your husband you'd like a couple times per week where you can be alone where he cares for your child and you can offer him the same courtesy in return. Sorry this response is kind of disheveled."

It means you may have some road bumps and hiccups but you understand that it's about the big picture and eating some cheezits isnt going to ruin everything. That was something I really struggled with before. Still working out all the kinks but I'm getting there
EatingIntuitively,flnggmx,t3_fpx9j0,1585318065.0,"Yes, I feel this way sometimes too. You're not alone. The more anxiety or stress in my life the more I to tend to think about dieting as a way of having control. I can't control what others think of me, but if I'm super skinny then at least I can control that one thing that people think about me right? I'm often so afraid of judgement. And afraid of not feeling comfortable in my own skin as I have been at a higher weight before and remember the unpleasantness of certain aspects. I don't weigh myself really but I have also visibly gained weight. I just try to keep it in perspective.  As you say you spend time taking care of yourself. There's so much more value in that than a number. And I think about how even though I've clearly thickened up, my body image is now actually much more tied to the respect I have for what my body does for me and so it is usually better overall even if I had some bad days or weeks. I try to move everyday too. Staying in shape by doing yoga, light hikes, and light weightlifting makes me feel better overall because it reinforces the gratefulness I have for being able to do such things at all--to be fortunate enough to occupy this body and experience life on this planet we call earth."
intuitiveeating,flezx7z,t3_fo5f6r,1585094981.0,"Yes. 100% agree. Thank you for your perspective. Dieting and the ideologies that drive us to diet are mere constructs. I've long been a subscriber to the belief that society/culture is all a human construction, created to serve the purposes of power. I saw it in the law, in politics, religion, etc., but for some reason I failed to notice it where it was right in front of me--my beliefs about myself and how I should look/appear in order to be deemed attractive or well liked by those around me."

EatingIntuitively,flb296w,t1_flavsvw,1584995900.0,This one is on my list of things to read!
intuitiveeating,fksgedj,t1_fkp691n,1584489484.0,Yes! This! Taking a walk outside in the spring weather has really helped it feel less like a sci-fi movie as you so aptly stated.
intuitiveeating,fksfzyy,t3_fk3ohn,1584489226.0,"That's so interesting! I'm just beginning to feel more in tune with my hunger and fullness. More than I realized was possible. I haven't observed any specific cues for fullness yet, but today for the very first time I observed/identified the feeling I get of ""neutral"" or 5 on the hunger scale. I never knew what to do with the sensations in my body before and just identifying what it was was like a revelation to me. I feel more equipped to understand those sensations and feelings without being disrupted by them now. It's so cool! Thank you for sharing."
EatingIntuitively,fkqctu6,t1_fknscu6,1584440757.0,Positivity is good too!!
EatingIntuitively,fknf810,t1_fkm4yse,1584364186.0,"It is normal to have mixed feelings about your body and struggle to come to terms with you weight and how you feel about your body as you go through IE and continue to educate yourself. Dont feel bad for trying to work through these issues for yourself. It's ok. And totally normal. Sounds like you're pretty aware that just working on acceptance and neutrality, and Respect for your body are the biggest steps here."
EatingIntuitively,fkkn5mu,t3_fixbo8,1584287764.0,"Obviously things are pretty crazy in the world right now. But I feel myself in a potential transition point in IE where my appetite and hunger are starting to perhaps level out a bit (4.5 months in). I'm beginning to understand my hunger/fullness more and that for me the difference between hungry/cranky/tired and needing some peace and quiet or needing a snack is sometimes rather subtle (as far as bodily sensations).  I also used to eat several small snacks/meals throughout the day and I'm beginning to find that frequency of eating inconvenient and have started gravitating a bit more towards larger meals with less frequency. I'm interested to see where this goes as I let my body guide me.

I also eat much more on a daily basis than I ever would have imagined was acceptable only 6 months ago. And I have more energy. In fact, I didnt even crave my morning coffee at work last week and forwent it altogether. I occassionally still have underlying thoughts and judgements about the amount I have eaten, but I am able to keep it in perspective and say if my body was asking for more food it's because it wanted more food (or because I ate that weed brownie yesterday...hmmm lol). Either way I'm willing now to accept that shame and guilt are not actually useful tools in thinking about myself or my eating. 

I believe I may be approaching my set point weight based on  the calming of my temperament and appetite around food. The prospect of being able to maintain a comfortable weight for my body naturally (no obsession, counting, or compulsive behavior) is so extraordinarily exciting for me. I reached a new level of calm in my life, I am more focused on my job, and have been able to better succeed, recognize my success, and accept rest time with less guilt than in the past. I also stopped taking hormonal birth control pills a couple months ago too, so lots of factors potentially weighing in here on my overall improved mental health (although I'm not all the way there yet)."
FitForFun,fkk8bdc,t3_fir2rg,1584276953.0,"Went on the AT yesterday. Probably stay home and do some yoga today, maybe another walk on the AT depending on how I feel. I've done basically nothing all weekend and I'm cool with it. That's self care too after a busy week of work."
intuitiveeating,fkerj8j,t1_fkdu6yy,1584119183.0,This is what The F*ck It Diet recommends and I feel it does really help to just slow down.
EatingIntuitively,fkeqoas,t1_fke6ute,1584118680.0,Yes I tend to be practically insatiable. I think it's quite normal because your body is at work.
EatingIntuitively,fkbuajn,t1_fkbkns2,1584040009.0,":) It was called ""make fudge not war"" it's chocolate ice cream with fudge chunks. So creamy and choc full if fudge! I love it haha. It's basically an Aldi brand knock off of Ben & Jerry's. And that sounds great! I love peanut butter anything haha."
EatingIntuitively,fkarlvx,t3_fhcfq2,1584017710.0,I ate a whole pint of ice cream last night. Not sure how I feel about it. I ate a bit past fullness but not a lot. And it was yummy. Felt sort of regretful this morning but moving past that because it wasn't a binge at all. I savored and enjoyed it. But I think I could have stopped a bit sooner than I did based on my own fullness. So I'm making that observation/collecting that data and moving on.
EatingIntuitively,fk5nce2,t1_fk5mdju,1583884052.0,Aw yeah. Lactose intolerant.
intuitiveeating,fk50z53,t3_fgff00,1583871394.0,"You appear to look more fit at a higher weight. But I'm sure you know this. I'm confused if you have been doing IE for a month how it is that your photos are relevant here if the ""progess"" photo is from three months ago? This kind of thing is difficult for some people on this sub to see. 

Also, I feel concerned that maybe you're holding onto a lot of diet culture with a post format like this (with comparison photos) that would really be more relevant in r/xxfitness. Bodies change. It is normal. But very hard for us to accept in a society that believes losing weight is good and gaining it is bad. 

Honestly this is hard for me only because I'm struggling with a lot of body image issues myself but you look great--strong and healthy. 

Just remember to be kind to yourself. I suggest you read the IE book and stop weighing yourself as your next steps."
EatingIntuitively,fk4z20l,t3_fg91wh,1583870346.0,"I took some rest after being sick a couple weeks back and feel much better.  I've eased up on exercise lately. Rugby season has started so I'm willing to let that shine as the number 1 exercise priority. And I skipped yoga the past two mornings because I slept in a bit. So I'm learning to value my sleep/rest as much as exercise when it is reasonable. It's sort of tough though honestly because the negative thoughts about maintaining an exercise regimen are still somewhat intrusive. But I'd rather re-train my brain to accept it instead of obsessing over trying to maintain a particular physique because it became physically and mentally unsustainable.

I think I'm finally beginning to approach my set point after 4.5 months of IE. I could feel the weight being added to my body, and I stepped on the scale for the first time in months the other day just to confirm. I dont want to restrict at all after seeing the number. Still it was slightly triggering to see it although I'm glad to use it simply as data for now. It acted as confirmation that I'm in tune with my body and aware of how it is changing, so no need to use the scale in the future. It's not a healthy behavior for me personally as it developed into an intense obsession at one point."
EatingIntuitively,fk4xpm9,t3_ffxofq,1583869616.0,When I was dieting I convinced myself I liked almond milk because it had less calories. Real milk is way better! No more almond milk for me!!
EatingIntuitively,fk4xcop,t3_fg3szl,1583869420.0,Your digestive system may just be more full on a consistent basis now. I used to walk around life empty and I'm pretty sure that included the waste being processed in my digestive tract if you know what I mean. May just take some time to adjust to eating larger quantities.
EatingIntuitively,fjzad9t,t1_fjz01nx,1583715068.0,I can relate! Salads for some reason seem so much more appealing in warm weather. Not as good in the winter to my tastebuds because I tend to crave more comforting/warm foods.
EatingIntuitively,fjslglp,t3_fep9np,1583598262.0,I used to think the same way. Even though I didn't want to count calories I still did because it was so engrained. Now most of the time I can finally just eat and not think about the numbers or have guilt. I'd say it took me 3.5 months to get to a spot where I didnt calculate at every meal. I try to remind myself how truly rewarding it feels to take cues from my body and not overthink my food intake based on numbers or arbitrary limits but on true appetite.
EatingIntuitively,fjnpwpv,t1_fjncmm8,1583512282.0,I love that someone else is having a bread and cereal phase. I definitely went through that at first! If was funny to me because bread and cereal aren't even crazy foods but it was all I craved for a couple weeks.
FitForFun,fjl3epv,t3_fddes1,1583439167.0,"I'm experienced extremely joyful movement on Tuesday night but I sadly noticed that the exercise stirred up some thoughts and emotions related to dieting, counting, and restriction and I felt the tremors of that negativity the next day. I'm glad I could identify it! It's  good to just notice. I'm a little worried and annoyed though bc I dont want one of my favorite hobbies to lead down a slippery slope again. Got to be mindful."
EatingIntuitively,fjl199i,t3_fdunqz,1583437964.0,"I can envision myself shoveling all the bread products in my face today. I get this image when I'm stressed sometimes SO WEIRD haha. I'm also a little extra hungry because I exercised a bit more this week.

My bf made split pea soup and spent a lot of time on it. I'm really excited to eat it for dinner tonight and appreciate it. with crescent rolls on the side. Three months ago I would probably been afraid (yes, actually terrified) to eat the crescent roll. Now I know it's delicious and I can have it whenever I want! Yay! No stress about crescent rolls. There are so much more important things to stress about."
