Also many of the dogs and cats are stolen pets, if I have a pig pet no one will come steal it and torture it in a public market."
AskReddit,fn7yix6,t3_g05zg4,1586730209.0,"Are you serious? In the US you have diversity, you can share your opinions, visit internet sites unrestricted, don’t have face recognition cameras following you everywhere and scoring you, a better living wage. 

We don’t savagely steal and torture dogs/cats in front of kids/families, burning them alive, causing as much pain as possible to their poor souls, and then serving them as meals in a PUBLIC  MARKET.  The way they treat the environment, and animals is fucking sad. 

We don’t hide the number of people killed from a pandemic so that it can spread around to other countries causing them economic loss.

Yes the US is not the best country in the world, not even close. But compared to China and how shady/fucked up they are? 100% better I mean would a low income American ever immigrate to China for a better life and make it? Why do you think Hong Kong protested so much?"

Your story seems much different she is still not owning up to it. I’m sorry,  family not recognizing something so serious really hurts and leaves a mark. Hang in there, and stay strong."

I cut myself because in that moment I feel really numb or drowned in negative thoughts to the point where It feels like I can’t breathe or think. Cutting doesn’t do much but seeing the blood come out reminds me that I’m real, I’m human and it gives me a quick release, for a second I feel as if depression has left my body, I feel peaceful and sleepy but only for a second, then it goes back to the usual. In the end it’s not worth it, the scars are hard to hide and the release doesn’t last long enough..."

depression,fn6wm5e,t3_fzzeev,1586708781.0,"I am in the exact situation. Nothing really phases me anymore, even though I got a great internship I’m doing a half ass job because I have lost interest in everything. When I say everything, I mean everything; friends, family, passions, reading, playing, talking, so life in general. I have noticed that this has caused me to become dumber as well, I can barely communicate any thoughts or opinions they kind of all come up scrambled. My memory is a whole other story, I forget things after 5 minutes. I think I’m really only running on 5% of my brain due to how disinterested and depressed I have become. 

I have started sticking to making some daily tasks thus creating habits hopefully. I think maybe if I discipline myself things might get better in the long run, I will stop just wasting my days and letting time pass me by. I have been working on starting a personal programming project, thats the most difficult part starting.I think that has helped a little because now I realize how fast time actually passes."
AmItheAsshole,fn1l2ym,t1_fn1juib,1586564305.0,"No. I tried talking to her once when she canceled plans we had made but went to a concert with other friends and posted pics. I told her something like: “Hey, It looks like you are having fun and enjoying yourself and that makes me really happy. I really miss you, and it seems like we have really distanced from each other. Sometimes friendships fall apart and if I don’t fit in your life anymore that’s okay,  just tell me. I love you and am happy to see you happy”. She replied with “ahahhha what?!?! this is a prank, are you being serious?” Then she hanged out with me the following week and I brought it up and explained to her that I wasn’t joking, at the moment I was really hurt that she canceled on me but hanged out with others, and she gave a valid excuse free concert tickets. So after that it seemed that things were good again but here I am. 

Maybe this is insecurity but I don’t want to seem like a clingy dog following her around asking please be my friend, please give me attention... that’s why I didn’t talk to her about this again."

Just because somebody is a full time engineer doesn't mean they have all of the answers either. BUT, they are probably better at knowing when to ask for help, and that's the key. I hope it works out for you!

Thank you I love your advice. Now my last question is what if you were scared of looking incompetent so you made it look as if you are fine with the project but 5 weeks have passed and now you are in a big mess. The solutions and code is not really functioning the way you want it to. What should I do at this point?"
