Don’t masturbate for a couple weeks before the time comes and you’ll be jumping at the chance. I’m so certain you’ll like it, that just try it and if you don’t like it I’ll send you a hundred bucks.

I bought pounds of glitter from meadowview when custom painting my motorcycle. Metal flake is glitter. Basically think of a Mylar balloon put in a cross-shredder the guy told me. I prefer old school big ass flakes .015” or .025”. But when glitter (flake) gets finer and finer it’s just a dust you add to paint to make it color shifting / pearl paint. Who uses the most color shifting micro flake? Green to gold? Mixed into ink?

- You wouldn’t notice it’s glitter and 
- They sure as shit signed an NDA because that relationship would reveal the secret ingredient to counterfeiters

P.S. If I turn up dead it isn’t a suicide..."

AskReddit,fmv5kw1,t3_fx78fd,1586406677.0,"I (40m) have wanted a gold Rolex day-date since I was 19 yrs old. Not to appear rich but because it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. I want to one day hand it down to a grandkid if I live that long. How cool would that be, to have your grandfathers gold watch? Sure I could buy a decent used one for 15k on credit, but I feel like a gold Rolex is a symbol of success, and going broke making this purchase wouldn’t mean as much since I haven’t “earned” that life milestone for myself. I want to be at a place financially where a new 50k Rolex would hurt my wallet to the same extent as a $500 watch would today.  Therefore I wouldn’t feel like I’ve “earned” my Rolex until I’m pulling in 100x my current income. 

Well crap that sucks...I at least want it while I’m still young-ish...any ideas?"

Tell him to buck up he has a family now. Instead of sitting around crying together start dealing with reality and find a place to stay immediately and take it step by step. Take it day by day. You’re supposed to be supporting him not bringing him down. F*ck your landlady she goes home at night, keep every cent you have. A months rent to her is nothing, to you it is life changing. Find your parents and tell them you’re pregnant and need help and deal with your husband later. You have the rest of your life to kill yourself, at least make an effort to save your own a$$ first! Take care of your baby and kitty if your husband isn’t making it happen.

We have so much fun playing together and reading books. I wouldn’t take her favorite toy and throw it away, and I’m the best toy she has. I need to be here to step in and protect her when my wife gets out of line and talks to her the way she talks to me in the future.
