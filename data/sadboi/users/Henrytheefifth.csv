Aquarians also know that they do this and are generally embarrassed by it to some degree.

Don’t shame them if you want to get close. If you want to talk to them ask them a complicated and weird question on a subject that they would be interested. Seriously— if you send me a message saying “hi” I reticulate back into myself, but if I got a message like, “I just found out that time moves faster at higher altitudes. If humans reached immortality (but not agelessness) would we see massive age differences over a millennia?”, I would definitely jump into a conversation.

Aquarians are weird. Don’t paint us into corners or try to run our time, especially don’t nag about missed phone calls and texts. It starts a guilt/resentment spiral that is a sure way to lose their affection. I once dated a guy who would constantly whine that I didn’t reply back fast enough.

In the next five-ten years we are going to see immense layoffs and unemployment. Jobs lost by COVID-19 aren’t going to come back and automation is going to rapidly expand which is going to leave a huge sector of the population underemployed or unemployed and our old ways of addressing this aren’t going to work.

I loved Harry’s crap outfits (and cravats!), his smarmy behavior, his complete adaptability to the world where he was operating.

The problem is that Harry was actually really smart. He knew how the markets worked and he, weirdly, had a vision. Harry’s dream is something very much like our current algorithm based entertainment market. He saw beyond the dream of creativity into a world of pure profit. So of course he has to be gross. He’s the embodiment of consumption and profit.

I run a non-profit for underserved rural students and offer free tutoring and resources to over 400 students. Yes, I am working online right now. I have to work hand in hand with kids who are struggling to get online. I help kids do their homework using my own internet connection. I’m one of the few people in my county that even has the internet. I am extremely aware of how the market works and I am surrounded by abject poverty. I live below the poverty line in one of the poorest counties in the United States now. Don’t buck up to me. 

Yes, I’m going to blame consumers and the endless black hole of consumerism that has this country by the balls. There are people who live in this country that don’t have running water or front doors on their home and the market isn’t helping to lift or liberate them. 

Hairdressers, as a class of workers, are in an extremely vulnerable position. Traditionally and historically hairdressers were servants. It used to be legal to beat hairdressers with their own brushes. Hairdressers are still widely underpaid, undereducated and overworked. It’s a shady industry that needs to be reformed. Consumers need to be invested in how they treat workers, especially those who work in service. It’s unreasonable that the market is so constrained that it cannot bear interruptions or provide equitably. 

People are losing a golden opportunity to enact serious reforms and replace decaying systems. I have yet to see any compelling arguments about the rationality of our current economic system but rather two groups saying that things aren’t sustainable in their own way. Don’t normalize what is happening or roll over to this shit, man.

It’s so sad to realize that #metoo was just a political tool when it was opportune and that people will turn on us when we are inconvenient."
Paranormal,fp5a4ar,t1_fp59qfp,1588321692.0,"Yeah, that does suck. If you want to test it you can try turning the water off from the street, but it’s a pain in the ass. Hopefully you get someone affordable and competent. 

I’m a girl, too! My husband and I lived in a century old house when we first married and we had tons of pipes problems and I’ve seen it all. It’s awful when pipes fail. Seriously, best of luck and stay safe and healthy."
Paranormal,fp598n2,t1_fp58wl3,1588320774.0,"It’s probably got a melange of different kinds of pipes at this point, some original lead might still be in the house. It was super common in older houses to run pipes near and below stairwells. I’m honestly 100% confident that this is absolutely a case of leaky pipes. The only thing haunting might be the plumber’s bill. Good luck, bro. Sorry this is happening."
Paranormal,fp58m5p,t1_fp58buu,1588320126.0,"Houses generally have a track of pipes that connect all water sources, they aren’t just in one place. Unless you want to draw me a floor plan of the house with all of your water sources I’m not going to be able to get specific, but if your pipes are leaking it could very well cause spots in multiple places in the house. How old is this house? What kind of pipes are they? Is his room on the ground floor? How close to the stairs? IDK what to tell you other than that. Everything you’ve said points to pipe leakage."
spicy,fp58852,t1_foip6vv,1588319729.0,Yes! Dave’s Ghost Pepper is gnarly and I hate it.
Paranormal,fp57ymw,t1_fp57qkq,1588319465.0,"The pipes are always under pressure, it doesn’t matter if you are using water or not, there is always water in the pipes. Unless you guys want to go out to the street and try to turn off the water yourselves for 72 hours to experiment it’s easier just to get a professional out to check on things. Pipe leaks are weird. The pipes could be in the walls near the stairs, leaking, but you’re only feeling where it is pooling in a certain area."
Paranormal,fp57b5o,t1_fp575dy,1588318803.0,It depends on the house. I’d call your landlord because this sounds like a leak and not a haunting.
Paranormal,fp56nox,t1_fp56h68,1588318135.0,It can go on for months as a trickle before the pipes burst.
spicy,fp56jxf,t3_g8kolc,1588318028.0,"A couple of years ago I was in Wisconsin for a wedding (I’m from New Mexico) and was invited to have dinner with some people at their house. The lady of the house set out the meal on the table, made us say grace, and then passed out the food. There was some corn that had some nice red spice on it and I was kinda relieved because I was in spicy withdrawal at that point. She even warned me that it was /super spicy/. Turns out it was covered in... paprika. I wanted to cry."
spicy,fp55x93,t1_fox9g0i,1588317395.0,It’s good on fresh chicharrones.
spicy,fp55ntb,t1_fowzjjy,1588317134.0,Happy (spice) Cake Day!!
Paranormal,fp54xy4,t3_gbd3oa,1588316439.0,TBH this sounds like a child who is extremely sick who should return to the ER before her brain fries. I would be more concerned with her having brucellosis-meningoencephalitis than a demon attacking her. Also your profile has zero karma and I have a lot of doubts about all of this and I find it disturbing that you didn’t immediately return to the doctor after this.
spicy,fp54ju7,t3_gbd3sx,1588316073.0,Chili oil with black bean is the best.
Paranormal,fp54g6c,t3_gbctoy,1588315984.0,Check to make sure you don’t have ruptured pipes. I had ruptured pipes that started as wet spots that ended up flooding my house.
breakingbad,fp54dlb,t3_gbcrlo,1588315919.0,Dude chill with all of the watermarks. They’re so distracting it’s hard to actually take in the piece. It makes it look like an escreen ad from 2007.
