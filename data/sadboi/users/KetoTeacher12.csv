JustEngaged,fqi3v9n,t3_gj2rb8,1589389585.0,"This literally JUST happened to me! I had a 7 and it was so big it went flying off my hand... absolutely terrifying. I went back to the jeweler yesterday and they resized me.. I’m a 5.25 which is crazy considering I thought I was a 7. Think about how much your body fluctuates. When you’re warm/hot your fingers will swell, and when you’re cold they’ll shrink. The jeweler recommended that you don’t want it too tight but you also want it to be a bit tricky to come up off your knuckle. I would ask your jeweler if you can try on different sizes and then see if they can resize it. If not, there are cheaper ways to resize. I was wearing scotch tape on the back (I don’t recommend this! It itches and is a pain) but I know there’s methods like a rubber back or two metal balls that can help with resizing. I say go with what feels right to you! I hope this helped :)"

They’re testing in their main parking lot- I pulled up and waited in my car until a nurse came and asked me if I was showing symptoms, was I diagnosed with Coronavirus, etc. I explained I wasn’t diagnosed but I believe I had it in February. After that, they give you paperwork to sign and initial and ask you to pull into a spot until it’s your turn. Then, a nurse comes and knocks on your door and asks you to come to the trailer for the antibody test. They have you sanitize your hands before you come in. They draw blood, and you’re good to go! Entire process took about 8 minutes total and I’ll have my results in 24 hours. I’m so hoping it’s positive so I can donate!"

I’ve become terrified of leaving the house. Today was the first time in 33 days I left to pick up takeout as my husband was in a meeting he couldn’t get out of (he usually picks up food). I put on my face mask and waited outside the restaurant as the employees were calling out names with food ready for people to take from them and go. Everyone waiting outside was NOT 6 feet apart and I stood as far back as I could. If someone was behind me I inched forward, if in front of me, backward. Then, people started just going in the restaurant to look at the to go bags that had been placed in the window that had not yet been picked up. Luckily, ours was handed to me directly (I did have to walk to get it) but I had a full blown panic attack because people weren’t six feet apart!!! I don’t know what to do when everything opens again because I feel so out of control. I know I can’t control other people but why can’t others follow the rules?! I don’t want people next to me, I want everyone wearing masks, and now I am terrified I was exposed to the virus tonight. I scrubbed my hands when I got home and I took a shower after dinner. My husband is concerned and told me I can’t stay in the house all summer, and is worried about my mental health with my anxiety. This anxiety is through the roof, worse than I’ve ever been and I don’t know how to cope. Help me please"
