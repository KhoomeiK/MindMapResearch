AskGayMen,fg5vyse,t3_ewziy8,1580541161.0,"Hi!

You sound to be a very kind gentleman and that's a good thing. So there's a lot of factor covering your concern including the demographics, environment (where are u from again?) and behavior of people towards gay in your area (example if bullying is rampant in your area for gay people).

Being gay myself, I have tons of male friends and made tons of male best friends from places I have been into. For me, I don't usually took advantage or befriend any male who I know isn't going to take my time seriously but nonetheless I still talk to them. So, gays and everybody else, are somewhat sentient enough to know that someone is genuinely interested to talk to us or some sort thereby helping us to respond accordingly. 

I mean, being nice can be tricky if its pretend (not saying that you are pretending) because friendly people are welcoming and that's easy to spot and to go along with. 

Also, I can be your friend too."

legendofkorra,ffw8jjn,t3_evcgmt,1580289533.0,"I personally don't think that the creators *only* have a one series in mind given how capable and versed they are in developing world-building narratives.  A ""could've been one-series"" thing for me is just marketing, that if the viewers doesn't enjoy that one series, at least they know when to stop. 

The way each season are woven together is really good. I mean, each chapters are world building in itself; ""AIR"" ""SPIRITS"" ""CHANGE"" ""BALANCE"". It speaks into the broader spectrum of the avatar world. 

The Legend of Korra is really good for me. Good that you don't want to compare it to The Last Airbender for the reason that it has a different setting, conflicts, generation etc. Good because the creators didn't made the new team similar to the old gang that we knew, but made them more mature and understandable to the generation that we can understand with more complicated politics, media, technology and different ideologies dragging each other."
