I don't know how to make him want to be good to me. He says he wants to, but he gets so angry whenever I ask for sex if he's regularly said no. He knew my needs before we dated.

BPDlovedones,ex0mhn2,t3_cqtqk5,1565916768.0,"I ruined probably the best thing to ever happen to me. I hope something better happens now that I'm a better person. I was mentally ill in a family that didn't (at the time) believe in mental illness and wouldn't help me get help even when I begged. Unless it was a threat to send me to the ward. Well, I grew up in a home where my parents treated each other like crap. My mom was always screaming and my dad was always lying and sneaking around. My mom would hit me when she was upset with me. My dad did twice that I can remember. I grew up thinking this stuff was normal. My uncle, grandfather, aunt, cousins, and mother were all angry/temperamental. They brushed it off as anger ""running in the family"". My jealousy, anger, and former need to control destroyed my engagement. My partner of 6 years ghosted me 5.5 years ago. It took until a year ago (with the help of weed, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin) for me to realise that I played a huge role in sabotaging my engagement. I still feel regret. I'm doing well now and have been for about three years (other than sorrow), but he'll never know, unfortunately. I'm in a relationship and I'm good to my current partner and I was food to my most recent ex, but I thought I was truly good to my ex fiance. I wasn't. But I did love him more than I will probably ever feel again."
