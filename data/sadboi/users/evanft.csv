CoronavirusMichigan,fr2pypr,t1_fr2ey7c,1589841683.0,You’re 100% right and it’s one of the things that concerns me about the data. My assumption is that the tested population has a higher chance of having it than the population at large since they actively try to get a test.  But there’s no way to be sure.

CoronavirusMichigan,fr2datw,t1_fr27zpj,1589835314.0,"It does give you a much better idea of the spread, though. When you see positive test rates decline, it tells you that the spread is slowing down, and obviously the opposite of the rate goes up. Raw data doesn’t necessarily tell you that.

If you had a sudden influx of virus into the region, I would expect to see an increase in the rate of positive test results. That does not appear to be the case in this situation. If anything, we’re seeing the opposite."

CoronavirusMichigan,fr26p7m,t1_fr1wd4t,1589832078.0,There has not been a spike. Look at the testing done after April 30. There was a large increase in testing. The positive test rate has been generally lower than it was before April 30.
CoronavirusMichigan,fr26k7z,t1_fr1obn8,1589832010.0,"Um, I don't think you're looking at this properly.
