if it makes you THIS uncomfortable, and the mans hasn't made an ounce of an effort to remedy the issue knowing how much it affects you... maybe he doesn't care enough about your feelings..?

however, i also like to create more abstract paintings or geometric drawings, which usually start as a concept. like, i can think about how the piece will look, not in terms of visualization, but more so how you'd attempt to describe a piece you're looking at in a gallery if you were on the phone with a friend. ex: ""it's drawn in [insert style] and uses [insert medium]. it makes me feel [insert type of way] because the overall vibe is very [insert adjective].""

you have your rights as a citizen and human completely stripped away. people talk about you as if you're an object that is ""broken"" and needs to be ""fixed,"" without even considering your wants, needs, or the facts of the situation.

the whole system is set up to make money from insurance companies, not to help people. i know this for fact because it's been studied, but also because i witnessed people without insurance (who sure as hell needed to be there more than i did) get kicked out almost instantly within the 72 hrs, while others with insurance, who were obviously more stable, were not allowed to leave. 

i could go on and on about the injustices and actual HIPPA / general legal violations i witnessed there, but that would take all day. 

i come from an extremely well educated military family with my mom being a lawyer + politician, and even then we had to hire a very good lawyer from the area in order for me to be released. i can't even imagine how it was for others there.

people who work in those places won't listen to reason; they just assume if you managed to wind up there, you MUST be crazy..

very valuable input here. my parents are both undoubtably mentally ill (i'm not sure of the exact diagnosis so i won't try to guess) and between them they've made a couple million dollars over the course of my 24 years of life. 

i also know a lot of people in med school and a couple in medical departments of the gov (CDC FDA etc) who pretty much echo the sentiment of your comment: that contemporary western medicine is absolutely not the be all-end all of wellness, due to it being a billion dollar capitalistic industry. 

i also have a theory that wealthy people tend to describe their mild schizoaffective symptoms as ""synesthesia,"" which is undoubtably portrayed as a positive trait, while less fortunate people with the same exact symptoms get diagnosed as ""schizophrenic.""
