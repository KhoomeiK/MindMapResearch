SuicideWatch,fpwkrjx,t3_gfsv5a,1588965184.0,"Maybe this won’t help but it took me a while to learn that not all therapists are equal. I spent years with the ones talking about breathing and telling me absolutely nothing I didn’t already know. Then, by chance, I ended up seeing a student health psychiatrist in college and it was a whole other world. She listened to me. Actually listened. Offered comfort when I clearly needed it and advice or sternness when it was necessary. She noticed things that no other doctor or adult in my 23 years of life bothered to notice. She is the reason I am now diagnosed adhd and have access to a stimulant medication that has done more to help my anxiety and depression than any anti-anxiety med ever has. She was so helpful to me and I am so grateful I was lucky enough to stumble into her office that day. 

I don’t say this to imply it’s easy. I went to school far away so now that I’m home I can’t see her. I’ve been told the only way for me to receive therapy is to find the doctor myself which has been comically difficult. And I know they even if I find one it might be weeks or months or even years before I find one that is the right fit for me. 

I guess all I’m saying is please don’t completely discount therapy yet. You maybe just haven’t been sent to the right people for you. And that’s not your fault. Unfortunately the answer isn’t easy and it isn’t fast and it isn’t guaranteed. But it’s insane how much of a difference a good therapist or the right medication can make. I’m still running on fumes from seeing that psychiatrist at school, where I haven’t been for over a year. It’s fucking hard. I won’t tell you it’s not. But just know that you don’t have to lose hope. Not completely."

With who I am I feel the odds are already stacked against me and with this added factor it seems impossible. 

Most days I am fine and thankfully my minor outbreaks are rare. But I always forget how much I need to hear that I’m still worthy of love. Worth pursuing. Worthy of a good life.

PanicAttack,fn45h1v,t3_fzfz58,1586634450.0,"I’d like to start by saying I’m sorry you’re going through this. You can do it. I’ve experienced panic attacks for years and unfortunately I still haven’t really figured out the let it happen thing. But my go to response is to try and distract myself with something I enjoy. I’ll play a mobile game or do a puzzle. Maybe some coloring. 
I don’t try to actively fight the emotions, but also don’t let them make you spiral. It helps me to know that my anxiety is something I cannot control, that the way it makes me feel is not always true. Don’t let it convince you of things you know are false. I think it’s also important (even while distracting yourself) to let yourself cry or whatever else your body needs to do to release tension. Eventually you’ll realize I’m out the other side. 

I wish I could be of more help, I’m sure you’ll get some great answers from other people here. I wish you the best of luck and I wish you strength. If you need someone to talk to feel free to hit me up.

Edit: also, I know you said you’ve tried meditation but have you tried mindful meditation? I am awful at meditation and mindful meditation actually helps me calm down when I’m having the worst panic attacks. Basically you focus on everything around you. My favorite way to do this is to close my eyes and list everything out loud by sense (helps to distract my brain from the panic). For example I will list everything I can feel like my clothes or my shoes or wind on my face. Then list everything I can hear, smell, and so on."

I’ve had various types of therapy and medication for things like anxiety, depression, and adhd (none of which were diagnosed until I was 20 so those slipped through the cracks too) and I’m baffled that it’s never occurred to anyone in my that I might be autistic. 
My two closest friends in college even worked with autistic children on an almost daily basis and those people understood me better than anyone has in my entire life. Took me a while to realize that’s probably not a coincidence.

DoesAnybodyElse,fm4uwq2,t3_fssyg8,1585761266.0,"Like many other people here have said, cleaning as you go is very helpful as you don’t have to face a giant mess when you’re done. Also, good prep is pretty helpful with letting you just worry about the cooking part and maybe figure out how to have fun with it. Chop and measure and separate every ingredient before you start so when you need it you can just throw it in and go. 

My other advice would be to try different styles of cooking and maybe you’ll find something you like? Think about what other activities you enjoy and see if you can find any elements of those that can translate to cooking. Try baking cookies, making soup, cooking a steak, roasting chicken, cooking pasta, or a number of other things. Also try using ingredients you really like and may be excited to use. 

I’d also recommend starting with smaller things that require less time and effort. For example, my favorite way to cook meat and vegetables requires a stove, oven, cast iron pan (and sometimes an extra sheet pan) and takes less than 30 minutes start to finish. Plus most of that 30 minutes it’s in the oven so you can do whatever you want while its cooking. 
I think it’s all about trying things and starting small until you figure out what you like. Good luck!"

PublicFreakout,fk98u4s,t1_fk6pmz3,1583971092.0,"I paid $900/month to rent a 7’x9’ room with no windows in an apartment that was old and rundown and owned by an old woman who had more strict rules than I or anyone I have ever known had growing up with our own parents, let alone some stranger treating full grown adults like literal children. 
Things like no trash can in the kitchen, renters not being allowed to put a trash can in the kitchen, but also being told we could not have a trash can in our rooms. Paying rent through money transfer that can ONLY be completed by going into a branch of the landlords bank and doing some form of direct transfer/deposit. And no shaving of any kind in the bathroom in addition to the expectation that you clean the entire bathroom after you do anything as little as washing your hands. And far too many rules to list. 

I actually chose that place because any other listing I found for less than $1000/month was for the opportunity to rent a bed in the shared living room of an apartment that always had at least 3-5 people already living there. Which is nearly impossible for me for various reasons. 

All that nonsense to live south of the actual city of San Francisco. Needless to say, I was out of there the moment my lease was up and thankfully my parents were happy to let me come back home (about an hour south of SF) until I sort out a new place to live so long as it wasn’t that insane.

autism,fizx5h3,t1_fizvz92,1582878576.0,"I respectfully disagree. I have spent a lot of time over the past few years coming to terms with my different conditions. I consider them a part of me and as much trouble as they cause me, without them, I genuinely believe I would not be the empathetic, thoughtful person I am. I would not want to even meet the version of myself that never experienced any of my problems because I am 100% convinced they would be a worse version. 

I recognize that everyone’s experience, even within the same diagnosis, is different. For example, with my anxiety, particularly panic attacks, I often get feelings of great anxiety and fear with absolutely no reason to feel that way. It is entirely irrational (it is not worth going into the fact that I am completely aware that there may be factors outside my immediate evaluations contributing to this because it is beside the point). 

I like to think I am a strong and extremely astute person 
particularly when it comes to my own mental health. I am very aware and accepting of the fact that all of my issues are a part of me and in that way, somewhat valuable. They helped to create the good parts of who I am and you better believe I put in lot of constant work in to consider them assets and almost friends as a way to remove some of their power and work through it all. But Id argue it is appropriate or maybe even healthy at times to think of this as a battle. 

I think most if not all people who have been suicidal (for example) would agree or at the very least understand that at a certain point you cannot help but accept your mental illness as an adversary. It does not listen to reason. You cannot bribe it. You cannot strong-arm it into submission. You must figure out how to ‘defeat’ it. To disarm it. And I believe in that way, it is very much a matter of battle and weapons. Defense and offense."

Something that has helped me is putting some kind of weight on my body while sitting or laying down. A weighted blanket I think would be the best option but they are generally not cheap so I am currently saving up for one. In the meantime I like to cover myself with heavy blankets (keep my feet uncovered so I don’t get too hot) and add a pillow on top of that and then add heavy books on top of the pillow. I find it most helpful to have the weight on either my chest or upper legs or both. Then I just lay there and try and breathe deep and allow myself to feel my feelings and just let it pass. Sometimes it takes a while but seems to be effective. I would also try drinking water, especially if you’ve been crying.

Herpes,fg25a7m,t3_ewg8p2,1580438553.0,"As someone with GHSV1 this is really really nice to hear. 

But the idea of not disclosing simply because there is a low chance doesn’t feel right to me. When I was diagnosed I was absolutely devastated. That coupled with the fact that the first few people I told, both new acquaintances and old, reacted really negatively and were incredibly mean about it, makes me feel very very strongly about the subject of disclosure. 

Don’t get me wrong, I hate that I have to do it and it stresses me out every time but I would never ever want to knowingly put someone else in the same situation I had been in when I was diagnosed. I didn’t know who it came from and there was no way for me to find out. The person who gave it to me either didn’t know they had it or was some level of ignorant about how it might affect me. Because of all this, I would argue that a 1% chance still warrants disclosure. A small chance is still a chance and I would personally be furious if I contracted it from someone who knew they had it and chose not to tell me because they assumed it would be fine. 

I know that it would be easier and better for everyone if we could instead just not have to deal with all the stigmas and false information about herpes but I think we all know that’s a long way off. And I don’t think the answer is to not talk about it. 

Maybe I am wrong and maybe these feeling come from a personal wound I clearly have not fully dealt with or received closure on. Maybe it’s a result of a toxic need to please people. But it just seems like the right thing to do."

Herpes,ff29948,t3_er2227,1579497570.0,"For me, my saving grace has always been the thought that people who will ostracize and judge me for my herpes are people who I wouldn’t want to be with anyway. Unfortunately I have not yet been in an actual relationship that proves this point but I have met people who decide that me as a person is more important to them than my diagnosis. Long story short, people that really value who you are will be able to look past the fact that you have herpes. 
True or not, it’s what gets me though the day."

Herpes,fef9n0k,t3_eny88m,1579051445.0,"I am female with ghsv1 and my first outbreak was a living hell. So many sores I couldn’t sit down at all and I couldn’t pee without literally screaming in agony. Since the first one finally went away, every subsequent outbreak for me have been months apart and only one sore at a time. 
Everyone is different so I can’t predict how it will be for you, but it’s very possible that it will get a lot easier once you’re through the first one."
Herpes,fef98fz,t3_eo5dcy,1579051176.0,"For me a big point is that when people are rude or mean and can’t see past it, it kind of automatically filters out people I wouldn’t/shouldn’t want to be with.
Sometimes it’s hard for me to take solace in this but it’s always what gets me by in the end."
Herpes,fdsp30o,t1_fdnxc5a,1578706111.0,"I was actually quite promiscuous during the time I received my diagnosis, but I was very careful with protection, talking to partners about testing, and getting tested regularly myself. None of that mattered when I contracted ghsv1. It had nothing to do with how many people I’ve been with and everything to do with the one person I contracted it from."
Herpes,fdsoazz,t3_emtwoh,1578705831.0,"I have known about my GHSV1 for a couple years now and have disclosed many times to both friends and potential partners. I believe it’s just as important to be totally honest as it would be with any other transferable disease. Whoever I contracted it from (I don’t know and cannot find out) probably didn’t understand that they had literal herpes and maybe didn’t even know they could transfer it to me. I still struggle with feeling like I’ve been tricked or cheated because there was really nothing I could’ve done to prevent it. I never want to put anyone else in that same position just because I’d prefer not to talk about it. Frankly, I feel like it’d be selfish not to fully disclose."
Herpes,fdsn31n,t3_emyeel,1578705372.0,"I know it’s not much of a consolation, but as someone who has hsv1 genitally, and constantly struggles with it, worrying about ending up alone etc, the only thing that keeps me going is knowing that people who really care about me won’t mind. Sure, the condition may affect how you interact with someone and when but to the right people, your diagnosis is just another fact about you. People who really care won’t let that get in the way. I know it’s hard to believe sometimes. But it helps me. Stay strong you got this"

Also I feel the need to utter the obvious comment that that movie doesn’t accurately hit a single point about the life of a tall girl."

socialskills,fcm36bb,t3_ehv5nc,1577763032.0,"You’re certainly not alone. I’ve struggled socially since middle school and am now 23. Sometimes it’s not you and it’s simply the people around you. I’ve learned that I don’t get along particularly well with people my age but do great with those a few years or more older. 
That and the fact that people who do like me, really like me and appreciate me for who I am. That doesn’t necessarily make the struggle of feeling isolated any easier but it’s good to know that you’re not an unlovable or broken person for it."

Then again, I’ve struggled to make friends since middle  school (I’m 23) so I’m incredibly socially inept to begin with."
