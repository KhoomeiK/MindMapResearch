I don’t see how my posts could’ve garnered attention. I don’t see how my posts could’ve satisfied any kind of fetish. And I *definitely* don’t see how my posts could’ve goaded others into self-harm: the intention was the exact opposite.

There were some clear changes in substance and goal, as there was a major update to the current situation. For the first one I needed to stop her from partaking in ongoing self-destructive behaviors. I showed her everything from that one, but it wasn’t enough, hence I posted again. For the second one I needed to get through to her how bad of an idea that was. And I knew that the comments would overwhelmingly oppose any method of self-harm, but I did not want to prime or bias their opinions.

Me and her are best friends - the closest either of us has ever been to another human being - and are both drastically happier than before we met one another. I’m doing better than I’ve ever been in my *life*, thank you very much."

WorldofTanks,fhbuadf,t1_fh838j3,1581450026.0,"Well I'm not talking only about major qualification, but for this let's assume I am.

Your options for getting trained crew for a tank are this:

* Pay 200 gold per man to train them to 100%, or pay 20,000 credits per man and grind the remainder
* Transfer them from the previous tank for the exact same price, for which gold is completely worthless if they have no perks, as it would cost the exact same as just training a new crew with gold
* Transfer them from a specialized training tank at 100% (or another percentage; maybe that would be more efficient?)
* Transfer them out from a premium tank (which undeniably works for this, but not everybody has gold and there are only a few premiums in there)

&nbsp;

While your calculations are correct, it doesn't take into account the effect of your crew's training level on performance and thus XP gain. Assuming commander bonus, 75% proficiency on all crew (82.5% with bonus) would mean 8.1% higher stats for things like loading and aim times, and 7.5% lower stats for things like traverse speed, compared to the 0.43% increase/decrease for 90% (99% with bonus). For the commander, the view range would be 89.3% with 75% proficiency, and 95.7% with 90% proficiency; so like 383m of view range versus 357m (7.2% difference). Obviously, 8.1% lower reload speed doesn't translate directly to 8.1% higher XP gains, and we can't really know for certain what the actual impact would be.

It also depends on what crew members you transfer over. The main point of training for the extra crew members is to transfer out said extra crew members: presumably the loader and/or gunner. If you only transfer out those two, then it is drastically less XP loss. For tanks that make less use out of view range, traverse speed, and/or spotting range, there is less need to transfer the commander, driver, and/or radio operator for their proficiency bonuses.

&nbsp;

Then there's the proficiency and equipment bonuses, or perks from dedicated training crew, that all affect performance and thus the XP gain of any crew in the training vehicle. Especially if you get higher XP gains in the training vehicle over the target vehicle (*ahem*, artillery XP gains), which would be expected because you're playing the target vehicle for the first time. If the training vehicle is elite, then that is even more XP gain over the target vehicle. 

Random tangent: I chose the Grant as my training vehicle for its insane DPS, and the first game I got Mastery 1 and 7 kills. This could easily be a fluke, but I just found it interesting.

&nbsp;

#TL;DR - Too many numbers... too many variables... my brain is fried."
NoFap,fh9sbbf,t1_fh8aeur,1581388466.0,Why does it happen only when I don't masturbate?
WorldofTanks,fh7sn4b,t1_fh7remc,1581343619.0,"Proficiency-wise, the gunner and loader are some of the most important, especially for tank destroyers and artillery. The gunner affects accuracy, aim time, and turret traverse. The loader obviously affects loading time, which is a direct impact on your DPS. Plus, if you are using a 4-man vehicle to train crew, then over a third of tanks you could move them to would be at least one man short.

While it sucks that you can only train one commander at a time, the driver is less important for a lot of tanks, and actually seems to only affect traverse speed. Although the driver's perks are really nice, if you are training him in a heavy tank destroyer or something, you can move him out without much loss."
WorldofTanks,fh7r4uo,t1_fh7pzmn,1581342398.0,"You can pimp it out and mount a bunch of expensive, permanent equipment on it; because no tank has two commanders, you can get Mentor on him and keep him in the tank; and you can get good at that tank, from playing it a lot - I noticed that my performance rapidly improves when I put my nose to the grindstone for a tank I dislike, instead of playing every tank in my garage sequentially."
