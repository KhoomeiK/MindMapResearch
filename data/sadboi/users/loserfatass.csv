SuicideWatch,fct3ibp,t3_eirbpp,1577931927.0,"""i guess whichever way our brain works,the suffering is the same""

exactly , even if one doesn't have the same mental illness....they would still feel like shit because ya know "" others have it worse than as, we must feel ashamed for being a whiny bitches and being depressed""

we all suffering here in the same hell hole

all im hoping is that we all magically wake up without this fucking sickness in us
god ? where are you? could you please help us?"
SuicideWatch,fct1ol4,t1_fcmnqxv,1577930574.0,"yes....i dont have any motivation or any kind of drive to do any fucking thing....

nothing really matters to me actually
not that i will magically be interested in doing something later...
video games? a played a lot


shows? i watched a lot


any other hobbies? i dont care


friends? i got none and i dont plan on making because most human beings are boring as fuck and they can back stab you


get job? fuck no, i got no drive in doing so nor any interest


get married? fuck no,why would i trouble someone with my sorry depressed ass?


travel? i got no money plus whats the point?


so what? is that all?"
SuicideWatch,fcl83wj,t1_fcjgtt2,1577741855.0,"its just me....really...like im the main problem here
i just dont care enough to live...nevermind working to improve it
i dont care enough for others
i dont even care if i live or die
but when im alive im causing others big troubles...
so it seems im better off dead
thats all...the problem here is me
not even depression , not even bad life Experiences....i dont know if it's linked to why im being like that now...but see? its all my fault for being this way...
thanks for caring about me ...it means a lot"
SuicideWatch,fciyuwx,t1_fc65r98,1577673120.0,"yeah lets find it....to me i wish i was strong enough to improve my life
i wish i was more hard working
i wish i didnt consider suicide and let go of all my life
but thats my only choice....i got nothing to do now to fix anything....i got nothing left of me....
but anyway....good luck with any steps your making"
