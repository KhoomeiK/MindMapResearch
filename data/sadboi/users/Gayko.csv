SuicideWatch,flzu0wn,t1_flztpzr,1585633550.0,You don't have to.
SuicideWatch,flztnlt,t1_flzt5o8,1585633220.0,Why?

Cringetopia,fcxnoer,t3_eikhdy,1578067257.0,"Hey just so you guys know, you are making people want to kill themselves for having an interest. Someone posted how they were called a pedophile for liking MLP. They do not watch pony porn or whatever the fuck you guys said, this person was a victum of pedophilia, and now is considering suicide because you brought up that trauma. Please do not shame others for having interests. It's not 'funny' or 'cool'. It's honestly disgusting how you treat others. The people you should be shaming are the ACTUAL pedos, molesters, rapists, and abusers. Congratulations. You could have killed someone.
Edit:grammar"
