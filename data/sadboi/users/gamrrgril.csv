Until they brought in Anton LaVey. In my opinion, it‚Äôs just disrespectful to portray someone like that, especially when they are no longer alive."

I was unsure of if this is a bipolar thing, or if I‚Äôm just lazy? I‚Äôve been on a concoction of medication, but I still feel like this. I‚Äôm an online student, and I wait as long as I possibly can to do my schoolwork. I tried volunteering at a shelter, but I‚Äôm having a hard time pushing myself into going back. When I first started taking my medication, I felt like I was motivated, and I actually get wanted & enjoyed doing work. Now, like you say, I just feel so numb. Having an occasional good day, here and there, but mostly, numb."

narcissisticparents,esn6e8l,t3_c8gvqt,1562123740.0,"Similar situation here, 

I didn‚Äôt tell my ndad until after I got married(to someone I‚Äôve been with for five years who he hasn‚Äôt ever met, because he‚Äôs a narcissist), and I was just telling him out of respect so he didn‚Äôt have to find out from fb. 

He was so incredibly angry that I didn‚Äôt have a big extravagant wedding and that I didn‚Äôt have my ‚Äúfamily‚Äù there. He just went on and on about how he doesn‚Äôt approve as if his opinion actually holds value in my decision making. 

To which, I hung up and sent him a text, because I never would have been able to tell him everything over the phone. But I sent him a very long text explaining why I‚Äôm able to go on with life without him present. He seems to think that because he created me that he just gets instant respect, and that‚Äôs all that being a parent is. He never replied to my message.

I hate that others have to have shitty parents, but at the same time I‚Äôm glad I can relate to someone else‚Äôs post. Truly sorry you have to deal with this. I just recently decided to go no contact with my dad for good. My happiness is more important."
