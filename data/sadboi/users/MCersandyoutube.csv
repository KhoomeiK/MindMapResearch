OCPoetry,flcot6b,t3_fmzrac,1585039895.0,"-Everything Dies-


Everything dies

Nothing makes it out alive



Fondness is consumed by the hour

Possessions will all be devoured

In time everything will grow sour

As life‚Äôs flames absorb all power



Everyone dies

No one makes it out alive



Not one heart will beat forever

Not one soul can endeavor 

To venture in the desert 

On and on through the ever 



All dies

Nothing will survive


So why is anything alive?"
