sex,foldk7b,t3_g7tx0o,1587859946.0,"My dad never talked about sex in any regard other than the fact that I could not be gay in his household.  Edit: actually, he did draw a diagram for me if how women get pregnant when I asked if I was gonna get pregnant from masturbation.
My Mom was cool, I asked her if masturbation was wrong when I was like 7 or 8 and she said of course not, it's natural. And when she was told by my girlfriend's mom that we had been having sex, when I was 13... She said ""it's just a phase"" --- regarding the sexual orientation part. Nothing whatsoever about the sex at 13 part. 
Dunno, maybe that was not ok. But the point is, now that I'm an adult I am very open with my partner and enjoy her being open with me. Sex is wonderful and amazing and so beautiful. And it should be enjoyed so much. 
I never thoughtk about what I'd be like now if things were different. Maybe I'd be with a man. : Shudder :"
