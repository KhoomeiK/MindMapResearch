And it can even be the case if you're really attractive. I have never complained about attention form men, but relationships didn't happen for me until pretty late. No high-school sweethearts either. Short lived relationships until I met my fiancee. Same goes for some other people I know. It will eventually happen for you, if you try to go and meet new people. It will still be difficult to find someone to date, as it is for most people, in my opinion. But don't give up, one day someone will want you. And keep approaching girls you like (just don't be too desperate about dating just any remotely attractive girl, they will notice; not saying you are like that but I've seen plenty of guys acting desperate). Even if you don't feel like going to meet people, do it anyway because you might end up liking to hang out with them. And if you don't like it there, you can always go home. Also, don't come off as too pessimistic and bitter to people, act positive, even if you have to pretend a little at first. Girls don't like guys that are too negative.

Also, it affects my relationship with my SO. I have gotten better but I still need to work on it a lot.
As for your situation, maybe you could consider moving out, if possible. This way, you won't be interacting with your family as much and seeing them less will make less opportunity for your anger to manifest towards them. If you can't move out, maybe try to avoid them when you're feeling angry. I know, it's not the best solution but I believe it can be better to try to avoid a situation instead of it happening more."

It gives hope that you can still keep your social anxiety in check and at least pretend to enjoy talking to people, despite all your issues. As for me, I can talk to people much better when I'm in a good mood, but it is much harder when I'm depressed. Kind of makes sense though, I suppose, because it's easier to deal with difficulties when you're more happy and optimistic, rather than when you're being sad and wanting to be left alone. I've gotten better about talking to people since I stopped working from home and moved to a job where I work with a lot of people.
Some people, however, have very severe social anxiety and they just can't manage to overcome this. Have you seen the movie Eight Grade? A berry good example of this. I hope someone like that messages you and hopefully you an help them."

Also, clamly tell him how it really makes you feel, repeatedly if necessary, at least that has helped me to be nicer to my boyfriend when I feel like getting angry. Him explaining the effect my anger has on him makes me want to treat him better and helps me to be more self aware about my behavior. And if it's that bad, maybe he can't help himself much to control it, he probably needs therapy. Also, exercise helps, it can take the steam off. Just a walk can help.

As if you did the opposite of killing yourself, you did something that can make you feel more alive. Kinda poetic, if I think about it, haha.
And I can also tell you what I told someone suicidal the other day on why you shouldn't kill yourself. The thing is, I can never tell someone that it will definitely get better but how will you ever know, if you kill yourself right now. If you have a long life ahead of you, anything can happen that will totally change things for you for much better, but nothing good will ever happen to you if you end it.
