I’d say we’ve pretty much achieved  a mostly bigot free society and that’s where New Wave Feminism came in. It doesn’t mean equality it means women over or above men. That’s not right. If Feminism is needed it’s needed in the Middle East where women are currently treated horrendously. I believe the only thing needed in first world nations is equality, not feminism. Feminism has fought its war and won here."

I’ll read up about these countries situations.
I agree that people shouldn’t be treated differently because of race but it’s still true that a lot of countries employ generational compensation. A lot of African Americans speak for it, I bring it up as the Native Americans seem to have been done quite a bit worse than a lot of others and America is such a first world country rated among the world’s most sophisticated yet they’ve done this weird avoidance thing.
Hmmm.. underfunded and ignored. That’s kind of what I’m asking about. Why is it so ignored by such a first world country? I guess I’m asking modern Americans why they think that it’s ignored?"

ShittyVeganFoodPorn,fph139y,t1_fp9k9la,1588613099.0,"Cream is a consistency. Butter is a stable emulsion of proteins/solids and oil/fat. That’s why ghee isn’t butter once you take the milk solids out. Peanut butter is made when the oil is released through the breaking down of the peanuts so that the tiny pieces of solid are suspended in the oils/fats of the peanut butter.
Think about the difference between coconut butter and coconut cream. And then coconut milk is also different. Milk doesn’t mean cow milk. That’s why the packaging says contains dairy.
Same with almond butter and almond milk. Cream and butter are different processes and products. I feel like there are a lot of vegans hating on this comment because they don’t like the fact that it is strange how you label things.
Milk and butter don’t mean body parts or products. Wings does. Why would you want to make ‘fake meat’ when you don’t like the idea of eating meat? If you want to replace something in your diet that’s great for you, but why emulate the thing you want to do away with?
I don’t want people to read this with an aggressive tone.
In a slightly more extreme example:
It’s like if a cannibal decided they didn’t want to eat people would you feed them ‘fake human’? No. So its honestly strange to me that vegans want ‘fake meat’ rather than no meat."

There are tonnes of laws in other countries that make sure indigenous minorities get free housing, discounted or free schooling and Uni. Cheaper healthcare and are put forward first for competitive jobs.
America doesn’t have any compensation policies for Native Americans? This is the weirdest fact for me. There was no national apology and they’re still put on shitty little reservations and they don’t get any benefits.
Example: Australia actually issued an apology to the indigenous inhabitants for invading and crimes against them and acknowledged that they had prior claim to all land and set up priority services for all the descendants.
America hasn’t done anything, their crimes were way worse, and they still seem to be proud of that chapter of their history. Wtf? Can any American explain to me if this is seen as a taboo in America and not just the rest of the world?"

Her mum was driving us when we stopped to ask if we could get some lollies from Woolworths because cinema candy was expensive and limited to the basic popular choices. I went straight to the Lolly isle and there was what I can only describe as a Sid Vicious  look-alike. Tall, dark hair, 18-25ish, moody looking, in front of the Licorice section. I shyly asked him if I could get a packet from in front of where he was standing. He said ‘Oh someone else who likes licorice!’ in a surprised voice. It was like being struck by lightning. I had this crazy need to know him.. it was like an instantaneous imprint.
My friend called me from the end of the isle that we had 5 minutes before the movie started. I ran for the checkout looking back saying: did you see him!? And then we left. I was literally glued to the window trying to spot him leaving the store and I told my friend in the car about ‘the guy’. I never saw him again. I still think of ‘Licorice Guy’ and I regret not speaking to him so much. It’s been over 10 years. That close encounter of another kind taught me never to walk away from that kind of connection ever again. 
And the last two times it happened I met my current partner and one of my closest friends.
Thankyou Licorice Guy, you taught me a super important lesson about instantaneous recognition of people I want in my life and about instincts."
