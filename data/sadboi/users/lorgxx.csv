BeautyAddiction,fpyrd8j,t3_gg6lps,1589008215.0,"I've tried 2 Clinique foundation when I had oilier skin and set it with setting powder but I didn't like both of them. I felt that they were heavy on the skin and started to break up on my oilier areas in just 1.5 hours. 
I do recommend though, Maybelline matte foundations or loreal true match"

offmychest,fogpew3,t3_g2v0hg,1587755449.0,"I know I'm a week late, but I have to say, you should never blame yourself for cutting contact with someone toxic, or even lying to them. After all, even if you did hurt them in some way, they hurt you way more and led you to do the same to them. I know it's easier said than done, but one Moto I go by is not getting close to people before you really see what they're like in certain situations. They might be nice at first, or at an overview, but the deeper you get to know them you realize they're not so great, or just aren't your type! Make sure to really get to know people before getting attached, and one more tip, if you aren't sure if someone would accept you being trans, try bringing it up in a different manner and watch their reaction. for example: ""oh did you hear blank came out as trans recently?"" or something like that. That way you can see if they're transphobic or not. Hope this little ramble helps :)"
