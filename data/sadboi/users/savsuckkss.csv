AskReddit,fpelug0,t3_gcswj0,1588550053.0,"Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2!!!!
I used to watch people play the first game when i was a freshman in high school and i thought it was the coolest thing ever, i would even watch the play through again once i had forgotten about it! I love the free-roaming aspect and i LOVE vampire and werewolf stuff! I also really like that there are different species of vampires you can choose while playing through the game! So excited for this to come out, it was supposed to come out in march, but they pushed it back for some reason

Letting him know that it’s hurting you and the relationship will hopefully help him see that."
