It’s bleak but if we choose to go on, we go on. If we don’t, that too is our prerogative, as it was theirs.
I relate in that my parents are the only reason holding me back. They’re aging and I can’t do without them and I know they would be destroyed without me. But I also cling onto this inverted sense to hope. To bear witness to the world for as long as I can.

Christian,fm7f9d4,t3_ft9lqa,1585824801.0,"I think God would also want you to be working on your relationship with your very own self. It’s a good time to reflect on the reasons for why you made a mean comment. I think we all have mean and judgmental about others from time to time but it’s important to catch ourselves thinking those thoughts and immediately bring God unto your thoughts and headspace. This way the mean and negative thoughts would lose its power. 
Regardless of what’s going to happen, I still think the best way to go about this is to admit that you felt jealous and insecure or whatever else, admit that you did it, and ask forgiveness. However, the quarantine is not the best time to do this because you can’t do it personally. So maybe wait when you can do this safely in person. It’s not good to lie or keep secrets. The enemy will always find that as a way to torture you. 

However you should still pray and confess your sins to God. Ultimately when we sin against each other we are really sinning against God himself. 

Your apology to the girl might not mean anything or add to her life. It could also be giving her ammo to bully you. And then that means you would really have to brace yourself. But she can never accuse you of being a liar. However, you would clear your conscience and could walk away feeling more confident. 

Either way, once you’ve confessed to God, it’s all that really matters. 

You will learn as you get older that having any kind of hateful thoughts about others will weigh you down like a bag of sand and any friendships forged over mutual dislike of other people are doomed to fail.  And it’s not good enough to give up and say “well I guess I’m a b*tch!” and build a caricature out of yourself either. I mean it’s good to be aware that we are sinners. But we have to try. 

I’m speaking from experience as a person who suffered the consequences of many years of resentful and bitter thought patterns. 

Basic lesson in cognitive behavioral therapy. There exists a triangular relationship between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Basically they all feed into each other and influence one another. As human beings, we have little control over emotions but we have more control over our thoughts and behaviors.

A good way to invite God into our life is to literally put him in the middle of the triangle and to fill your mind up with God as much as possible. Since God created us for himself and we are intended to think of him, we actually won’t be distracted or bogged down by him. Sort of like the best ice cream ever. I never feel it weighing down my stomach. Horrible analogy but you get the point.

Anyways, good luck. 

Protect yourself and do what’s best for you, because God also want what is best for you. That could mean fessing up or just shoving this thing into black hole forever. Whatever is best for you and your relationship with Jesus."

For example, what are the underlying personal/social/intellectual motivations behind your question? If you are shopping or looking for an institution to give you truth, you would be sorely disappointed by all three. In Christianity, every church is its own hot mess and you will not find satisfaction in people. However the root of Christianity and its message revolves solely around the existence of Jesus and who he claims to be and all the scholarly, personal, and archaeological evidence that testifies to his name and his life. He is the embodiment of grace and the message is that humans desire perfection and perfect fulminant but can never get there. It’s about humility and understanding that no matter what we do, we all need the forgiveness of God, who is willing to pay the price for it. A lot of people do not understand the need for forgiveness and debt. But an example is if one were to put a dent to your car. Even if you nor the person involved pays for the repair of damage, someone has to pay for it to get fixed. Also a lot of people believe that they do not need a savior or that they need to be redeemed. Usually that means the person has not fucked up something beyond repair. But most people fuck up something beyond repair. They either hide it and repress the matter in shame or they have to contend with it and surrender it. Unpopular example: Hooking Up or sex without commitment . It’s socially acceptable and even encouraged. But people don’t like to admit that it fucks them up and they blame their experience of cognitive dissonance on internalised Puritanism, Shame, or slut shaming. It’s not. In every culture around the world, people have said that sleeping around is bad because it literally damages the psyche and creates a tear in the heart. Contrary to assumptions of Christianity, Jesus did not slut shame. Instead he protects Mary Magdalene from those trying to shame her and kill her. He tells her to repent, which means to turn to God, or rather for her to turn to God for protection and hope. 
This is one example of how Christianity is anti-moralistic. It doesn’t (and isn’t supposed to) condemn. Christians are barred from ever believing they can be any better than other people of other faith or non faith backgrounds. 

The other two religions, as far as I know, revolve around   the idea that humans must work towards perfection to merit God’s favor.

Islam and Judaism are moralistic-oriented, despite the message of love.

They are not “wrong” but they are religions of “not yet.” Essentially they are incomplete as if waiting for part 2. 

Christianity is the belief that Jesus is the part 2.

To quote Rev. Timothy Keller, “Christianity is the subversive fulfilment of all other religions.”

Also I’m a very melancholic person and the fact that the only emotion ever ascribed to him was one of grief allowed for me to feel his realness. He’s the only God that could see me for who I am. And that set me free.

That’s what the hospital donations are for.

BipolarReddit,fj2w2xs,t1_fj1dmoz,1582956047.0,"Before anything I want to say:

-lithium is not just about putting the fires out of mania. It actually has an antidepressant effect for bipolar patients. That’s why it’s a stabilizer. 

-fun fact: lithium is a natural occurring substance and there are springs that are naturally lithiated . The Native American used them as healing springs for people who were suffering from some kind of mental breakdown. 

-it’s life-saving. The pros far outweigh the con (unless you react severely bad to it in which case you might want to consider depakote or lamictal or some form of anti-psychotic).

Now the bad stuff: 

Lithium is literally a hard pill to swallow.  Here are the reasons why doctors are more reluctant to prescribe it:

-lithium is highly toxic and may not be safe for patients who are at high risk for suicide.
-regular blood work
-possible implications for thyroid related problems
-slight weight gain but way less than any of the anti-psychotics

I initially avoided lithium because I didn’t want to be bothered with blood work due to inconvenience and lack of insurance. 
But once blood work tests out okay for the first few month, I am allowed to be more lax about the frequency of the blood work. By the way, the therapeutic level of lithium is anywhere between 0.6 - 1.6. Too low, it has no effect. Too high, toxicity. 

Nowadays I really don’t mind it at all. Blood work feels as normal as going to the gas station once a month but with a pinch of ow. 

Personal note: I have manic depression with mixed episodes. Unclear whether one or two. I did have psychosis a few times from mania. I have attempted on my life 4 times and died once and brought back twice. I’ve had over 20 hospitalizations. All because of my unwillingness to stay on meds and unwillingness to prioritize my health over academics and work. 
Many doctors didn’t think it matter to informed me that bipolar was progressive and that my ptsd was snowballing into it as well. You are all probably too familiar with the number of relationships and finances ruined through this disease. Those things ultimately gave me anxiety and contributed even further to the depth of my depression and despair. 

I have lost a lot of cognitive functioning. I now have learning disabilities due to the number of relapses I’ve had.

I now take lithium and lamictal. It’s adjuncted with two anti-anxiety meds, and a reluctantly prescribed dose of an anti-depressant (those can trigger mania so we had to be super careful about monitoring that.)

I run two miles a day for mental health reasons. It makes me less depressed. I’ve learned to enjoy it.

My life is still in shambles but at least I now have stability and I’m grateful for that. 

There was a point in my life when I was convinced I was going to die one way or another.  But now things are clearing up my suicidal ideations are gone."
BipolarReddit,fj1wkk2,t1_fj1qixx,1582929412.0,"You are absolutely right. It is a very personal and nuanced decision for everyone. 

Yes medication may not be the only path to prevent progression and I want to add that it is also undeniably the best help out there given cost/benefit. 

Medication has the highest rate of success in dealing with bipolar disorder. There is a lot of scientific literature to back this up. 

However, once again you are right. Everyone’s condition is different with different ranges of severity/occurrence. 

There is also the margin of error where some people have been misdiagnosed as bipolar and therefore do not respond or need stabilizers on a long term basis.

It may also be true that some people have lucked out with genes that enable remission. 

However remission is heavily dependent on the stability of a persons life. There are stressors in life that can trigger these episodes.

Given how life is extremely stressful for most people, relapse is likely. 

But I do want to validate your point: yes everyone should choose what they deem to be best. No one is going to shove medication down your throat. 

Did I go overboard with my post? Yes for some people and no for others. But I don’t work for big pharma and have nothing to gain from more people taking mood stabilizers.

BipolarReddit,fj0ufot,t3_fav1v4,1582907926.0,"Just want to add for people that don’t know this yet:

If you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it is a certainty, you absolutely CANNOT go off of your mood stabilizer (lamictal, lithium, depakote, etc) because bipolar is a progressive disorder. This means each episode will get more and more severe unless treated—both the mania and the depression. And trust me, at a certain point you will either end up at the hospital at best or die by suicide. The black depression and mixed episodes are unbearable and very dangerous to yourself and perhaps others. 

No one wants to hear this, I understand but there is insurmountable evidence that bipolar is a genetic disorder. It is highly treatable but has no cure.

I hear so many stories from doctors who are ticked and devastated by patients who get better with lithium/meds but who refuse to keep taking them regularly due to *stigma* and side effects.

Please please do not, under any circumstance shame or encourage ppl to stop their meds unless you are that persons doctor.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/opinion/sunday/pastor-am-i-a-christian.html

“The Christian Church is pretty much inexplicable if we don’t believe in a physical resurrection. N.T. Wright has argued in “The Resurrection of the Son of God” that it is difficult to come up with any historically plausible alternate explanation for the birth of the Christian movement. It is hard to account for thousands of Jews virtually overnight worshiping a human being as divine when everything about their religion and culture conditioned them to believe that was not only impossible, but deeply heretical. The best explanation for the change was that many hundreds of them had actually seen Jesus with their own eyes.”"
Christianity,fitp035,t1_fisb4rk,1582726052.0,"https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/do-we-receive-the-same-body-we-had-on-earth-at-the-resurrection

“It doth not yet appear what we shall be”..yes because our body shall be transformed in the same way that Jesus’s body is transformed after death. And in our transformed body in its new state we shall see him as it is.

As to your last comment—no we are not guessing because Jesus clearly resurrected with the witness of 500. If the resurrection of Jesus is not something you believe in, then it defeats the entire purpose of his atonement.

“Fourth, Philippians 3:20-1 says that our earthly body is transformed into conformity with Christ's body in the resurrection, not that God creates a new body from scratch: ""For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.""

If you consider the “body” of Jesus to mean the collective human body, this would mean that you are proposing that the human race was collectively crucified and collectively resurrected during that time. That is not what happened. It was Jesus’s individual body that was crucified and resurrected. The term and usage of “body” was literal.

I strongly recommend reading this article, as well as googling the stance points of prominent theologians and scholars.

As for my last point:

I was in a really painful psychological state when I wrote this and was simply musing about a hypothetical situation.

First of all, I want to say that I can relate and identity with everything you are struggling. 

Having a safe home environment is a basic human need and human right and it’s an atrocity that you and many others on the planet are denied access to that. I’m so sorry. It’s a cause I want to devote my life fighting for. 

Is there a way for you to negotiate with the source of the pressure you are experiencing?

Loneliness is an absolute killer. Speaking as someone who deals with severe mental illness on a daily basis, it is lonely enough even when people are around because they do not understand the kind of world we live in. 
I myself have no idea how I’ll be able to really reconnect with people on the level I need. 
It’s not easy, that’s for sure. I’ve been trying to go to church or find places where I can gather with people. It’s hard. Sometimes I volunteer but don’t have energy for that.

Fuck the pink people. They are either in denial or in such places of privilege in life that they can’t have compassion for people who don’t have it. But realize that even those folks will find themselves absolutely alone one day. 

I’ve also been struggling with needing some people to apologize to me but I’m trying to grapple with the fact that this is something we have to let go because we have no control over others. Trust me, it’s been fucking me up to the point of no sleep sometimes. It helps me to know that there will be a day when everyone awakes from repressed conscience and have to contend and feel all the wrong they’ve inflicted. For many people this will be the worst day of their life. (This part is my understanding of judgement day. I am a Christian but I’m not here to proselytize nor apologize and trying to explain my point of view). 

If you wish to apologize to others and still have access to such connection, perhaps it would alleviate your pain to offer the apology. Then you’d know you’ve done your part and what other people do with it, is their prerogative.

antidepressants,fin9rzp,t1_fimey6t,1582559019.0,"Hmmm that’s not been my experience. Also anti depressants take up to 3-6 weeks for its full therapeutic effect and the unpleasant side effects should go away after that. But given the severity of depression, it’s worth the risk to go on them and see if it helps with depression. You can always go off and switch meds if you find it intolerable or numb. Personally I would rather find my emotions numbed out than to feel horrible all the time.  If it does numb you out you can see it as wearing a mental “cast” to help you stabilize while you work through therapy and coping skills.

I am aware of the angst and popular conspiracy of big Pharma. I am also aware of the often misquoted Faulkner saying that “I would  feel pain than nothing at all.” 
After 5 years of botched up rejection of medication and seeing how it has ruined my life, I only developed very slow stability after I gave up and became responsible with them.

I just don’t want you or anyone else to go through when I did. 

Those 5 years of being on and off with meds costed me close relationships/friendships, tons of money, and events that furthered traumatic experiences"
Psychiatry,fiibd4f,t3_f81syz,1582419386.0,Yes it’s viable in the long-term provided that it’s kept at a low (or maintenance dose). When I was hospitalized once a psychiatrist said that I don’t have to try to get off it because my 0.5-1mg dose is a baby dose and can be used for maintenance.

There are days when running is the only time I can feel free and “up”!for a short while. Unlike pills, it eventually becomes its own happy time. 

The right medication(s) are your ally, not something to be feared. I literally don’t know anyone that has become dependent on anti-depressants. Yes there are withdrawal effects when you decide to stop taking them but they last for three to five days at most. It’s a bitch but it’s not addictive. 
Benzos are hard to get out of because some people take heavy doses. But they’re no big deal if it’s 1mg or below per day."

If God loves and cares for us individually and equally it’s safe to assume that he is as likely to communicate with us (with the help of scriptural references) on a personal level. As his adopted children, he would not think us on any lower terms than Jesus and the prophets.  I mean, that’s the whole point of Jesus in the first place—that god lowered himself to identify as an equal human being and to show that he cares for our life and our suffering."

BipolarReddit,fi6277n,t1_fi43gj1,1582176614.0,"I have excessive thirst, grogginess, numbness, weight gain, and low energy. But this probably coming from the whole combination of meds. Weight gain is probably Remeron and lithium. Tiredness comes from lamictal and lithium.

My mood isn’t amazing but at least it’s not rocky and tempestuous anymore. Just moderately depressed but predictably and consistently whereas I used to be severely severely depressed and compulsively suicidal. 

So it’s not much, despite the cocktail of meds (which I take twice a day), but it’s the “best” I’ve felt in a long time.

By the way I’ve also tried ketamine infusions, ECT, and TMS.

They didn’t do much for me"

Christianity,ffzgbfq,t3_evzz1h,1580377653.0,"It sounds like a case is compassion burnout. I sense some anger and bitterness and that you bore witness to unfairness and injustice. Was there a situation that tipped you over and throw in the towel? I realize that being a hospital chaplain (or being in pastoral care in general) is super stressful and that you are constantly called and demanded to act and speak on behalf of Jesus. And since it is hospital I am sure people are not their best selves when sick and that some simply need your pity or bear witness for their own selves. 

As far as I can tell “empathy” has become a kind of a new “pop” value for the past decade and half. It has been prized as a top marker of good citizenship and human virtue. However I think we are only as empathetic as our own personal experiences and/or imaginations can go. It is impossible to feel empathy for everyone, especially strangers with whom there is no established trust. I believe that Jesus had empathy and sympathy for everyone because he is God and knows everyone and himself understands the sum of human suffering. But mostly I recall the parts of Matthew when Jesus was said to have been overcome with “pity” or “sympathy” when he ministered to the sick. 

I was chronically and severely sick for 5 years and often ended up in the hospital. There were times when my family couldn’t be there for me and I was scared and lonely and called for the chaplain for short company and prayer. In those moments, at my own weakest state of mind, I needed to imagine the chaplain as some kind of Jesus superhero. In many ways, it is dehumanizing as being a retail cashier who is treated like a vending machine.  I think I would have been very distressed to feel that I was an annoyance or burden to the chaplain so I’m really glad that you were aware of your limits and quit the field. I don’t mean this in an acerbic way. 

In the past people who did pastoral care would often say that they are not ministering out of love for people but for God. I admire those people but cannot imagine myself capable of such patience and sense of duty.
I believe that God gives us abilities, gifts, talents to call us to serve his kingdom in different ways at different times and not all of them are as obvious as selfless-fields (social work, chaplaincy, etc). So I think it’s cool that you’re probably being called to another line of work. There’s no need for guilt for leaving work you despise, no matter the line of work. I believe that it’s best to just do what you know you are best at. 

I honestly started off reading your post feeling kind of hurt and angry because it made me panic about seeking or receiving future spiritual care.
But I think I understand now.

Thanks for posting."
Needafriend,ffz106m,t3_evz1xz,1580360503.0,I am also 28F. I need a friend right now too
weightlossdiets,ffywvog,t1_ffywtwq,1580357179.0,:) good luck! It’s hard to start but you can do it! Small steps
weightlossdiets,ffyworw,t1_ffywcb9,1580357035.0,"You’re welcome! I also forgot to mention that your gut flora environment will literally adjust to the food you give it. For example, you might hate broccoli now but if you continue to eat it for awhile, your gut will grow to like it and send signals to your brain to crave it. Right now if you are used to eating sugary things or foods, you will continue to crave it until you stop. It’s a lot like addiction in a way. Basically, don’t worry about being a picky eater. The latest science says that you will literally grow to like whatever you eat."
depression,ffyvd9l,t3_evvpym,1580356083.0,I think what your therapist said is totally wrong and unproductive
weightlossdiets,ffyuhhu,t3_evygen,1580355450.0,"Hey there, being constantly cold could be a sign of poor circulation which could also be indicative of slowed metabolism. But that can be helped by consuming some hot beverages (I recommend herbal tea). 
Very light exercise helps boost metabolism. I read that a short jog can help increase it by 15%. So it’s all about getting the heart rate up. I recommend jogging because it’s most effective. Most people fall off the running wagon because they get too competitive with themselves so the model is always “run as slow as you can without walking.” Do this for about 14-17 minutes a day and you’re good.

As for the keto diet—if you really want to do this, know that it’s a diet and not really sustainable because eventually you’ll want to introduce some carbs back into your life. Basically when grocery shopping, check the carb and sugar on the labels. Absolutely nothing with sugar above 5 grams and carbs over 20. I think the carb allowance per day is around 50 or so.

I never go the ketone strips but you can do without it. Switch to unsweetened beverages. My favorite is la croix. I made my own granola for awhile with small bits of oats and lots of nuts. Mixed it with unsweetened peanut butter and frozen blueberries. 

Lunch and dinner were usually some form of protein (sausage and eggs being the cheapest ) and some veges. Cauliflower can fill you up and you can even mash it to make it taste like potatoes. Any vege that isn’t starchy is okay. 

Unfortunately you can’t target fat areas around the body because the body loses weight like an onion unraveling and it’s different for everyone. 

But toning the belly helps build and strengthen core muscles so that you don’t hurt your back. For this I recommend doing planking for about 1 minute or two once or twice a day.

If you want to get into an exercise program, try Jillian Michael’s 30-Day weight loss videos. They are free and available now, I think, on YouTube. I think sticking through her program was hard but it was good for helping with my self esteem and feeling like I can stick through. 

If you can afford it, avocado is your best friend in terms of how easy it is as a fast food item that is both filling and healthy. 

By the way, I’m speaking as someone who is 5’ 6” and currently 143 lb. My highest weight was 175 lb. 

Also note that if you are taking medications, some of it could be contributing to the weight gain.

It’s really hard to go at this all at once so you can start small like cutting out all sugary beverages.

Best of luck and most of all, please love your body because it’s trying its darnest to help you."
