MS is the largest contributor to the Linux Kernel. They use it for recruitment. Why would they want to continue developing multiple Kernel when they can write an opensource one, that they've basically built and shaped themselves (to an extent), continue on finding talent cheaper.

Or you could continue to pay for developing 2 Kernel and piss away money"
conspiracy,f72ugw3,t1_f72u2on,1573380311.0,"Well, it only makes sense they would do that, guess who's the main contributor to the Linux kernel. Working on Open source and contributing to something as vital as the kernel is valuable to MS in recruiting high skilled developers. So why would they want to develop 2+ kernels?"
conspiracy,f72s8wv,t1_f72rll6,1573376787.0,Yeah that's the direction I expect them to head. :)

Basically whichever ""easy"" to use linux disrto it was convinced HP or someone similar to install Linux out of the box but then MS counted the offer by offering dirty cheap volume licenses, I think they were charging like $100 then dropped it to $10 or lower to keep the business."
