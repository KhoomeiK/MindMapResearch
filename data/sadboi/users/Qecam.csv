In the pinned extraction method, it says to cut the cotton into four pieces (which, mathematically, then, wouldn’t each fourth be 62.5mg?), but here I see you saying not to cut them as it’s inaccurate and then to just soak the whole cotton.

Wouldn’t consuming the lemon juice after you’ve squeezed out the remaining cotton equal the full 250mg dosage rather than 125mg (it’ll be my first time so going with the recommended dose)? Or does soaking it weaken the concentration? My understanding was that the whole point of extraction was to mask the taste and, ya know, not shove cotton in your mouth haha.

I see on the back of the package that it says the product delivers .40mg-.50mg of propylhexedrine per 800ml of air. That’s obviously when it’s being used as intended, but does that mean anything with the way we’re using it?

Am I making this way more complicated than it needs to be? Do we literally just only drink half of the concoction to get a 125mg dosage?

Oh! Last questions for now lol, how long does it keep? Like, if I make a batch and only drink half, how long can I keep the rest lying around before it goes bad or loses potency? Do I have to refrigerate it? Does the container I keep it in have to be sealed tight like the one used to store the mix for the initial 24 hours does?

I see people say things like, “well I’ll raise my kids right!” or, in the wake of a tragedy, “my kids will never do something like that”. But that’s not something you could possibly prevent.

You can raise your kids to be these perfect sweethearts, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be incapable of snapping. Plenty of people who do things that society accepts as intolerance (like rapists, murderers, etc.) had a perfectly good upbringing.

Raising a child well does not guarantee that they will be a good person. My mom raised my siblings and I relatively well, good “morals” in a very religious household, whatever, and one sibling especially is still what society considers a very bad person."

But boy, what I wouldn’t give for her to adopt that viewpoint before I was fucking forced into the world.

On top of all the other limitless amounts of suffering, there are sick people out there who abduct and harm children. Why take that gamble? If you claim to love your children so much, why would you take that bet? Something terrible could happen to them. And that’s “just” physically.

I genuinely wonder if my mom would still have kids, or at least “us”, these specific kids, if she knew just how much we would suffer. All or most of us have severe mental issues and I know she blames herself for some of it, but I wonder if that would be enough to stop her.

But I’m gonna look around on, like, Psychology Today, figure out which psychiatrists take Medicaid, and try to get that addressed first. The thing that sucks with that, though, is that payment can be kinda vague because they’ll list how much each session is and what insurances they take, but I’m not sure how much I’d end up paying myself. I suppose I could call them or the insurance to figure that out, though.

I admitted total fault to the accident when it happened. I was given directions on which way to turn, I started to sort of inch out into the road (was turning out of an apartment complex), I didn’t realize how close oncoming traffic was, and I hit the gas instead of the brakes by mistake, and I sorta jetted out into the road. Got hit by a big Dodge Ram that I was told didn’t take any damage and everyone inside (a man with his pregnant wife, kids, friends’ kids, and dogs) was safe. I just kinda figured there was no way to work that in my favor, and accident or not, I do see it as my fault. I’ve been working with the court on those fees (and reinstating my license) for a while but I’m finally on a payment plan and getting that all sorted out.

To be honest, I didn’t even know I *had* the insurance until a few months later when I was calling to check the progress of my application (since I hadn’t gotten any word from them about it) and they told me I was already accepted.

Veggie Tales and (most but not all) Disney movies were about all I could watch. Most cartoons on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network weren’t allowed (Hey Arnold used bad words like “stupid”, I think my mom disliked Helga?, couldn’t watch Rugrats because my mom didn’t want Angelica giving me ideas to be mean to my little sister, Ren and Stimpy was inappropriate/looked ugly, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters had, well, monsters, Danny Phantom had ghosts, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy had the Grim Reaper, Gargoyles had gargoyles which are ugly and Satanic [couldn’t watch The Hunchback of Notre Dame for similar reasons], Pokémon meant “pocket monsters” and that’s Satanic, etc.). We could watch nothing higher than G-rated movies/shows. Lots of Strawberry Shortcake, Barbie, Care Bears, etc.

Oh, and does anyone remember Feature Films for Families? Rigoletto is still one of my favorite movies. I don’t think I could watch The Buttercream Gang but I imagined it was like a Stand By Me/Goonies sort of thing (not that I’d been allowed to watch either, so honestly don’t know what either is about). And [K10C/Kids’ Ten Commandments](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/english-voice-over/images/f/f7/K10C_Kids_Ten_Commandments_2003_DVD_Cover.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20170503081333&path-prefix=sv). I really liked those as a kid.

ETA: Harry Potter! Not allowed either. Witchcraft."

me if this doesn’t make sense. But like... I don’t think we have terribly too long left? So it almost doesn’t matter.

Like, my depression has gotten to the point where I kind of really do want to die, and a big motivation, I guess, is to take myself out before the world takes me out. The end of the world is coming with how we’re treating the planet and it’s probably gonna be more apocalyptic than taking us out in a big, catastrophic bang and I don’t want to suffer. Maybe that makes me weak. I know how I’d go, given the opportunity to end things myself, in a way that is peaceful. Peace is all I want.

I just don’t want to be here anymore. Existing is so exhausting. The other day, I depression slept for 15 fucking hours and I was still so tired, I just went back to bed. I feel guilty and ungrateful but I feel like I just... wasn’t meant to live. Not this long, at least. Not here. I dunno."
