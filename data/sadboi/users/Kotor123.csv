Futurology,eue3dbj,t3_cfzt84,1563734281.0,"I think that towards the end of the century, architecture, by necessity, will be more Eco inclusive and practical. Said architecture will have to accommodate the looming threats of climate change, overpopulation, and energy scarcity. First of all, let's talk about cities. You will start to see bigger and bigger buildings being built, not only office buildings but apartments, as a growing population continues to flock towards the big cities. These buildings may start to become mini-cities on their own, with stores and restaurants housed inside them (think shopping malls). Such buildings may start to include plant life in their design, as Terraces may house miniature gardens, and roofs may house small ""forests"" of trees and other plants. You may also see more vegetation in the overall landscape of a city, as more ""central park"" like areas start to appear. This is not only aesthetically pleasing but also serves to clean the air by recycling c02 into oxygen (genetically modified plants could do this more efficiently, and may even be able to remove other pollutants). Buildings may also be mainly white in color, as white is highly reflective, which helps with the energy needs of internal heating and cooling (and looks really sci-fi, I mean come on). Windows may be constructed out of photovoltaic glass, meaning glass that doubles as sort of a solar panel. This is done by inserting a thin sheet of photovoltaic film in-between two panes of glass. All of this is the idea of ""[Arcology](https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Arcology)"" a sci-fi term and concept which basically means more practical, eco-friendly, and self-sustaining cities. Here are some example images of what such architecture may look like:

A note on fashion: I can't really offer much insight into how such clothing may look, but I can on how its practicality could evolve. Electronics are obviously getting much more compact as time progresses, and I expect to see this incorporated into clothing. Such clothing could include self-heating and cooling systems, dynamic size adjustment,  etc. The energy for this would likely be supplied by photovoltaic materials located in the (probably artificial) fabric."
