Third salary alone is not worth working there at all and nobody can make a living off it so tipping is to show how good they were and their performance gets them the money. If nobody tipped servers would simply quit and places would have to charge more to pay the servers more money anyway. At least with this custom it conditions the servers to work harder and if they give you bad service you don't pay them much and if they do terrible they basically get bearly any pay for the week.

You literally said you had the ""exact"" same thing which to me is implying that you knew exactly what I was going through.

>I've said absolutely nothing hypocritical or presumptive,

You acted like you knew what I was going through then accused me of doing the same.

>just salty that I beat you to the punch.

Salty that I didn't call you out on saying you knew what I was going through...? What punch did you beat me to? Lying? Being a hypocrite? Yeah I glad I didn't take either of those.. I already provided the quote which was where you claimed you were diagnosed with the exact same thing implying you knew what I was going through. 

>Not even to mention that telling me, ""You don't know what you're talking about; my depression is not the same as yours"" would have made little to no sense in the context of the comment you said you were going to respond with that to, which was almost purely about semantics

Um no..? I said that after you falsely accused me of saying I knew what you were going through. I don't and I won't and the same goes for you. You have no idea what I'm going through. So yeah it makes perfect sense in that context and the rest of that paragraph is an ass pull.. It doesn't really matter anyway as that's not the topic at hand so I'm not going to discuss this further.

>I never disagreed with this, and again, I apologize if that was not made clear enough initially.

It did seem like you disagreed with this at first but I think was a misunderstanding on both side so I apologize too I should have defined more clearly what type of people I was talking about.

>I've had many friends who either romanticized depression without actually having it or understanding it, as well as ""friends"" who genuinely had depression but used it as an excuse to demand attention and as a manipulative tactic to make people do/say what they wanted (like, ""If you don't tell me I'm beautiful and perfect at least 3 times in every interaction we have, I'm going to go home and hurt myself, and it's going to be all YOUR fault!"").

Yes these are the worst type of people and the types of people I was getting at in my original comment. I didn't mean to seem like I was denying people that say they have it and I'm sorry if it seemed that way."
AskReddit,fqxzh8x,t1_fqrobji,1589740190.0,">Lol, sure. Just ignore the primary dictionary defintion of the word ""depressed"".

Haha wait until you fucking read the rest of my comment. Plus it's the English language people go off the dictionary definition every day, dipshit. Remember when ""lit"" was a thing? Yeah they weren't talking about a fire.. you should check out urban dictionary you might learn something. Ir maybe that's impossible for you.


>I 

>tried to ""make it look like [you were] saying something else""

Well thank you for owning up to your mistake. :)

That's literally what you did you reorded my quotes to say something else..

>I also said in another comment, in direct response to you, that:

>"" You are causing the exact same damage and belittlement as the people you're so vehemently protesting by acting like you know everything there is to know about depression and the people who suffer from it.

Still you know you're completely lying here as I never said I knew anything about depression in the first place actually. In fact this conversation wasn't about depression until your ass turned it into one. You're the one over here pretending you know more with you ""10 years"" of experience. I'm not the one flexing how long I've been depressed because that literally proves nothing and that's none of your damn business. I'm still out here looking for who fucking asked about your personal experience with depression.

>Who's "" taking peices of what I said and moving them around to make it look like I'm saying something else"", again?

I wasn't it was a mocking quote. Like this: ""I know so much more about depression look at me I've had ot for 10 years so you're argument is invalid because I've been crying myself to sleep once a week longer than youuuu!"" And who's to say I haven't had it for 20? Would that invalidate your point? No. Your point invalidates it's because it's so utterly stupid and the fact you can't stay on topic. Which is the fact saying ""lmao I'm so depressed"" is as bad as ""lmao I'm so OCD"" or ""lmao I'm so bipolar"" because they're all in the same mental disorder type boat. But you came in acting like the grammar nazi saying  that be depressed isn't depression by dictionary definition but my dictionary definition you're a bullshit liar dumbass because yes it fucking is because depressed can mean of someone with depression and you're a liar if you hear someone say ""I'm depressed"" and think they're using it to say they're sad. When I tell someone I have depression I say I'm depressed just like everyone else.

>Okay, so you Googled the definition. But I'm the ""moronic idiot"" when you literally skipped over the PRIMARY DEFINITION of the word ""depressed""

Jesus fuck how stupid are you? Every word has multiple definitions, dipshit and every time it has never been the first one. You're just trying to cover your ass because you didn't read the second fucking definition.

>Is someone who says ""This part of the skull facture is depressed"" or ""the economy is currently depressed"" also mocking people with clinical depression?

No because they are clearly not using it in that was but ""haha I'm depressed very clearly is and you lie as naturally as you breath if you try to tell me in that sentence people mean it as being a bit sad.

>I spent a maximum of maybe 1 hour actually, unequivocally proving you wrong. 

No you spent an hour lying.

>You spent... how long? losing your shit, ignoring what I actually said in favor of your own wildly-drawn conclusions, and becoming increasingly hostile/agitated in response to being told that ""words can have more than one meaning"". And yet I'm the one who's clearly overly stressed out and just taking that stress & aggression out on randos on the Internet?

The same amount of time proving your a dumbass actually. It's right there and you're trying to deny it by making more shit up. Cute. Regardless I've proved my point and proved you wrong. This is a hill I will die in but I didn't die. You did. You have no more evidence to prove someone say ""haha I have depression haha depression funny!"" Isn't offensive to people with real depression.

>I'm the unqualified (studied college-level English and semantics for upwards of 5 years)

Proves literally nothing

>big bad man (I'm a woman)

Damn that's crazy wanna go on a quest to find out who the fuck asked or why the fuck that matters?

>pulling shit out of their ass (the Oxford dictionary)

And skipping the second definition that proves you wrong.

>read the actual entire dictionary definition instead of just cherry-picking

Again that's literally what you did and even with cherry picking the sentence ""I'm depressed"" means they have depression 99.9% of the time. Otherwise they would say ""I'm sad"" like anyone else. Have you actually been in the real world? You're like an alien trying to prove me wrong because by dictionary definition that people don't actually use in that context because that sentence *COULD* mean something else and yet never in my life has it been used that way. So from real world experiences added into the mix you're in the wrong here.

>(I was, by dictionary definition, right,

By the dictionary and how people use it you are wrong.

>I actually acknowledged the other meanings of the word pertaining to mental illness instead of just omitting and denying its existence entirely).

Bull fucking shit. That is EXACTLY what you did actually. You only admitted it after I called you out on it because you knew that I was right but still won't admit that the other definition is the one used when saying you're depressed. Go to the fucking real world and say ""I'm depressed"" and see how many people assume you're just sad. I didn't omit its existence because it had already been established. I was only proving that saying ""I'm depressed"" not only can mean they have depression but used as it is today would be assumed to mean depression 100% of the time unless stated otherwise and you're a liar if you say people don't mean it in those terms.

>just because I'm super stressed out about something external in my life (you're the one who just wrote 2 lengthy paragraphs about how much of a pussy and a special snowflake I am) and ""wanted to prove someone wrong because you're always wrong yourself"" (I was, by dictionary definition, right, especially considering I actually acknowledged the other meanings of the word pertaining to mental illness instead of just omitting and denying its existence entirely).

Then what..? You admit you're being a bitch and a liar because you're stressed about something in real life and that's it..? You can't even finish you se-

Anyway that concludes proving you wrong. If you can find proof that saying ""I'm depressed"" isn't used to say they have depression most of the time (even though in real life situations 100% of the time someone has said the word depressed to me they meant as depression) and saying ""Haha I'm depressed depression funny depressionjoke hahaha"" isn't offensive to people that have depression then maybe I'll consider accepting it but seing as you probably know yourself that term is mostly used as meaning depression. Oh but by your logic depression wouldn't mean depression either because it has other definitions too... de·pres·sion

Wow congratulations you proved my fucking point and restated what I said while was ""depression is not a fucking adjective"" and taking peices of what I said and moving them around to make it look like I'm saying something else is a defense people use when they have no argument so they just lie about what someone said or take it out of context.

You can't say that because saying you have depression and staying they're depressed isn't the same thing!!!!"" Fuck the hell off and cut down your fucking inflated ego.

But you wanted to prove someone wrong because you're always wrong yourself is that it? Well sensitive little snowflake that can't take when someone uses the incorrect version of the word and writes an essay to prove them wrong even though said snowflake was wrong themselves and just wasted their time to be a dick because he doesn't know hoe to shit the fuck up when he's wrong I guess it's time I say goodbye. I'm not even sure what you're arguing about at this point because your argument was easily wrong and anyone could see that.

He was saying how other kids would make fun of me and I'm just like... okay am I supposed to give a shit? So yeah fuck anyone who says that right to hell you can shove it up your ass dad. We were also planning to paint my nails with the most girly colors possible just to spite him before the coronavirus lockdown but we'll be sure to do so after."

discordapp,fqefrxq,t1_fqcge47,1589306823.0,Okay but it wouldn't m add ke a difference eith better grammar.. if the person is smart they won't be scammed right? But if a person is smart yet gullible they'll read the bad grammar and just delete it. With proper grammar you get dumb and just gullible people. If the smart people won't fall for it they will literally weed themselves out.... proper grammar will get many more people trust me.
