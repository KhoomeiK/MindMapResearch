Whatcouldgowrong,fm11y8i,t1_fm0t68g,1585670495.0,"Again, false. You obviously don’t know what ‘vetted‘ means."
Whatcouldgowrong,fm0p2yp,t1_fm0nac9,1585663265.0,Absolutely untrue. The ashes or just the cigarette itself can ignite vapors.

mentalillness,fjj0bwk,t1_fjizwlb,1583380014.0,You’re so welcome. Do be careful.
mentalillness,fjizu9q,t1_fjizor0,1583379664.0,I almost had one a few months back though. That stuff really helped.

mentalillness,fjizmxr,t1_fjiz7bq,1583379517.0,"Anyway, I’m sorry you’re having an anxiety attack. I didn’t have my first one until I was probably 23. They are really scary."
mentalillness,fjizefh,t1_fjiz7bq,1583379348.0,"There is a national scholarship to study German abroad for people in high school. It is called the Congress-Bundestag scholarship. Might be worth checking out. It was for me. That was my exchange experience. Theres also a college level Tier of the program, by a slightly different name."

mentalillness,fjiywff,t1_fjiyh9w,1583378991.0,I would love to learn Russian. It is very cool.
mentalillness,fjiyuxf,t1_fjiyh9w,1583378962.0,I know Spanish and German. Spanish is such a lovely language. It was the first one I learned.
mentalillness,fjiyccx,t1_fjiy6aj,1583378606.0,"By the way, what languages do you speak?"
mentalillness,fjiy9dd,t1_fjiy6aj,1583378549.0, Don’t thank me til you’ve tried it ;)

mentalillness,fjixiwa,t1_fjix6nk,1583378042.0,"There’s always something that causes an attack. In my experience, it always feels like I am “stuck”. That is, until I figure out what’s bothering me so. Meanwhile, something that will really help with a panic attack is skullcap. That is the best stuff but I’m sure none is immediately available to you. Your local grocery store might have some, though. Traditional medicinals makes a “stress ease” tea with a lot of skullcap that is very good. It’s widely available."
mentalillness,fjix5tp,t1_fjix1md,1583377798.0,"Be well, friend"
mentalillness,fjiwwwt,t1_fjiwofy,1583377631.0,"In my experience, ignoring my anxiety doesn’t help. It is still there. Especially not if it is an attack. You have to address it."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,fjc5x1e,t3_fce7ny,1583209453.0,"I couldn’t agree more with these comments. Almost everything about this movie is a lie. Such a terrible shame, because these books had so much character. They were so inventive. As a kid about the age of Artemis when I read them, I remember how wonderfully they filled my imagination. Here, Disney is eschewing real fans of the series in favor of profits, or their false sense thereof. No one is going to enjoy this crappy film. Fortunately, we still have the books to hold onto. My, how cool they were."
whatisthiscar,eq885ci,t1_eq870zw,1559860618.0,Yes! Solved. Any idea where the VIN is stamped on these?
