magick,fa26hb3,t3_e7mmcc,1575778391.0,"Want something to make you happy, calm, sleepy, peppy, help with colds, pain management, wound cleaning? Plants have properties like astringent, anti inflammatory, sedatives, adaptogens, expectorants, and so on. Start there.  Or you can look up plant folk lore and start with something like ‘must have herbs for your witchy garden’"

seaglass,f6qucvb,t1_f6qt7ml,1573086139.0,"We live near a rock beach and we usually go closer to low tide and will look more where the smaller dime sized rocks are this time we looked where all the rocks are a quarter to half dollar size and brushed off the top layer of rocks and dug around a little. We seriously found piece after piece, more then what’s pictured here. The big stuff will be up higher and under the top layer!! It would take 4-5 trips to get just this many big pieces looking in the smaller rocks."
