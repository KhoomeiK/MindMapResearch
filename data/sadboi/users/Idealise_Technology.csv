Watch that on youtube, for me it breaks down a delusion well and shows how one can easliy slip into it even if they recognise its a delusion at the start, it grows and kills those ideas of it being a delusion until it becomes the only explanation, the only reality, even if it is improbable we will believe ibecause our mind fabricates evidence to support it, and ignores evidence that contradicts it.

A few weeks ago I kept getting the random thought tha the bleach in ny hair was what caused my psychosis, it was justxa thought then, nothing more, and at that stage I recognised it made no sense, but I slowly started seeing more and more evidence to support it and eventually shaved my head because I believed it would cure me. I can recognise now it was a delusion and could recognise the thoughts before as delusional thoughts,  but when all signs pointed to it being true it became reality."
