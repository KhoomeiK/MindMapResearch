video games - actually it almost felt like i am forcing myself to ""go back to the past"" because i wanted it, i liked it. now it totally felt like wrong and something felt off

snacks - i dont think its the ""act"" that is tiring, but rather the decision making, thoughts, calories calculation, etc. all the nonsense thoughts that is fatiguing. making things worse is the spasm, cramps sore throats that i get after even attempting them

I literally just keep checking all corners, buildings, maps.

kept worrying I missed a scene, treasure, or crucial item.
I remember one where I missed out an important GF (guardian force) in FF VIII, which I realised much later. hence having difficulty in fighting the boss.

which slowly degenerated into a habit of checking walkthroughs and guides on how to play, what to check, etc.

slowly slowly, game plays now become me following guides, and constant worrying of missing out. till the fun, and supposed to enjoy became torturous.

now when I play, I ensure I walked every single little corner. constantly pressing action button to clear the room. just to clear the area or map. this became the focus instead of the game story"

Perhaps the only way to go minimal setup is to remove the speakers, mini-itx without GPU and maybe remove the TV"

I'm totally in shock of the use of solid colors and simplistic look of your desks.

Plus you even divided and designed them for specific purposes.

Did the regular run, which has been detoeriating in performance.
But during the run, I kept thinking about what the wise one ""Sadhguru"" mentioned about ""living"" and not ""sleeping"" in life.

Which then I finally decided, to not waste/wait anymore... since there isn't a perfect time to wait for.

I been holding back the overseas trip in hope to break my ""bad"" routine habits. I have my reasons to hold back.

but anyways, I thought of deciding to go back home, after bathing the first thing to do is to book without thinking of any possible negativity or lack of justification.

end up realising that the cost had bumped twice, and the hotel time slots are limited. I immediately pulled back again.

dwelling back into the rabbit hole. started self blaming again.
this feeling of failure, although not the first time. but the amount of time wasted... is just hiaz. too much."

well, for those markers actually they come with pros and cons. its like what type of gamer that it is serving. for those who save and goes, not always dedicated type will find it useful to get back after a hard day? while those who like to explore and get into the story then yea.
