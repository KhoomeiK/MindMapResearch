SuicideWatch,fobdtgm,t3_g6fbu3,1587658785.0,"I met an artist once who told me his story.

He'd gone out into the woods with a gun. He sat there leaning against a tree for a long time, crying and trying to work up the nerve to shoot himself. I guess his emotional turmoil exhausted him, because he fell asleep.

When he awoke, a hummingbird was hovering about 2 inches in front of his nose. He sat absolutely still, marveling at how beautiful it was. For those few moments before the hummingbird flew away, he felt blissfully happy.

He was so glad he hadn't killed himself earlier, or he would have missed that feeling. He decided that those few moments of joy had made his life worth living for one more day. He wondered whether something might happen the next day that might give him a few more happy moments. He decided to find out.

When I met him, he'd been living on this principle for over 15 years."

Approaching woman

James tusk has really good videos on day game approaches, essentially talking to girls you don't known, wherever you want and getting results out of it.

Dating apps

I really recommend day game, but if you like dating apps, create a high-value profile with good pictures and get some membership, the return of investment is worth it. 

PlayingWithFire has good videos on online dating and text-game in general.
