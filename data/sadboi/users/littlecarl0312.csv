When youâ€™re in a dark spot always remember some random ass person out there(me!) is sending you good vibes, happiness, and strength to never give up. We can get through this darkness, we deserve to be freeðŸ’“"
BPD,fk97dr1,t1_fk94qd0,1583970243.0,"Wow you explained my life to a T. I sincerely hope you find the strength and finances to stick up for yourself and leave. Iâ€™ve been trying really hard to get my shit together so I can leave my current living situation too and start finding myself and my happiness. Just when I think I am ready to let go and escape, I get drug back into my toxic relationship with an abuser, as well as severe drug abuse to escape reality and the negative emotions and feelings associated with my toxic relationship. I want to get out, and finally bloom into the happy outgoing human Iâ€™ve been dreaming of! Best of luck to you and your escape."

ballpython,fimb92w,t1_filwv59,1582523771.0,"â€”Hey I donâ€™t mean to scare you but this exact same thing happened to me with my ball python only he was a little younger, 4 months old. All of the same answers to the questionnaire about the husbandry and feeding procedure as well. And my snakes eyes were foggy also for weeks but he never went into shed even after I had given him a couple baths. But he never ate with me. After week 6 of not eating I brought him to the vet because he lost about 14g which was 20% of his body weight. The vet force fed him for the next two weeks and then he refused the food I offered at home for the next two weeks after that. Eyes still hazy. He seemed fine until Friday when his energy and behavior drastically changed and he started acting strange. When I tried to feed him that night he ran from the prey(per usual) into his water dish(not per usual!) where he stuck his head under water for at least ten seconds(extra not per usual!!) I panicked and pulled him out because he was motionless and I thought he drowned(& yes I know snakes can hold their breath for a while under water, I worry excessively when it comes to my animals) and when he was out of the water he began thrashing his head back and forth(L to R) and corkscrew twisting(he is not a spider morph, it wasnâ€™t a wobble) for about 20 seconds then finally lied still. He didnâ€™t move for the rest of the night & occasionally i couldnâ€™t tell if he was breathing or not so I brought him to the vet first thing in the morning which was just yesterday only to find he had lost another 20g and was deathly ill. The vet gave him a hydration shot & a calories shot and sent him home. He said itâ€™s possible he got a respiratory infection or was sick before I even brought him to home back in December, but he was too weak to draw blood from for testing. This morning I woke up to find that he died last night. Iâ€™m unbelievably devastated and confused and severely distraught. I know youâ€™re probably thinking like wow what a terrible story why would she share this with me and Iâ€™m not trying to scare you!! I just was reading your story and it all sounds scarily similar to what I JUST experienced and I had to reach out and let you know so you donâ€™t lose your noodle. I hope itâ€™s just one of the millions of trivial reasons ball pythons go off feed and nothing serious, but listen to your gut if you feel like somethingâ€™s off!! Best of luck (:"
BPD,ff7zcvx,t3_erx5wh,1579661990.0,"Absolutely. You couldnâ€™t have explained that better actually. Growing up, nothing I did was good enough for my father. He never praised, only criticized and I believe that is part of the reason I constantly alter my personality to fit the social circle Iâ€™m involved in. That yearning for acceptance has lead me into attending church & praising the lord when I donâ€™t even believe in religion, or shooting up dope every day when my biggest fear is needles. I feel like I donâ€™t know the real me, only the spectrum of masks unintentionally hide under to fit into every situation. The fear of being unwanted or not accepted by my peers is unbearable, yet I want nothing more than to discover who I truly am and live each day comfortably in my own skin. Iâ€™m just not entirely sure where to even start. Iâ€™m sorry you also experience the frustration of this struggle, but you arenâ€™t alone!! I hope you get the chance to resolve those terrible feelings of being misunderstood. & if you find where to start at please let me know(:"
