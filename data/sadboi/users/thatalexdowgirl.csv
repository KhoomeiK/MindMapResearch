BipolarAndSober,fqpkmoy,t1_fqpb4fh,1589548611.0,Thank you for replying! That was really refreshing to read. Congratulations on your 14months. I’m so happy I’m embarking on the journey although I know it’s going to be hard. 🙏🏻
leaves,fqgtivo,t1_fqgtfj8,1589356631.0,Thanks so much; I may take you up on that offer! I’m currently going into work so that should distract me but I haven’t had my morning bong... I feel anxious and uptight. I’ll definitely reach out when I’m done with work however.
bipolar,fj9f1nb,t3_fc1lbb,1583145575.0,"Hi,

This is absolutely amazing!! Well done OP🙌

What's the App? I'd really be benefit. 

Thanks!"
bipolar,fiwfycu,t1_fiwakh1,1582784465.0,"Hi,

I'm sorry that your S/O got hospitalised. It's really shitty for us when that happens, well it is for me. I fucking hate getting locked up in the hospital but know sometimes it's necessary. 

What my boyfriend does when I'm manic is ""let me get on with it"" but keeps a close eye on my behaviour so I feel in control and feel like I can still express my mania but he is still monitoring me and ensuring I'm not doing anything silly. If it's really bad then my family and I have a plan in place where I am not alone ever, as I tend to make bad decisions that could hurt myself or others, so they take it in shifts to hang out with me to make sure I'm okay. Overall though, these people are just there for me, listen to me talk and love me enough to help me through when things get difficult and I value that above anything. Of course, this is only what works for me and my family. 

All of this was a plan made by me and my family when I was going through a stable time. I have a document that we filled out like a ""survival guide to my bipolar mania"" and a ""survival guide to my bipolar depression"" that really helped us plan so boundaries were in place for everyone. I'd be more than happy to email you these over and send you over some links to useful sites if you'd like. If so, just private message me!😇"
bipolar,fiwfi0w,t1_fiw9qpp,1582783998.0,"I ended up taking sleeping tablets to get some sleep. Couldn't cope with it. However, I'm up again wide awake, so painting may be the one 🤷"
bipolar,fiw3p9f,t1_fiw3jit,1582774420.0,"Damn. I've been to sleep I've just woke up and can't get back to sleep. Don't think I could survive going to bed at 7am earliest. Hats off to you. 

I might try watching some things. Thank you 💫"
bipolar,fiw3jsq,t1_fiw3geo,1582774316.0,"I'm stuck downstairs and my boyfriend is sleeping in our bedroom 😭 This would have been such a good idea, thank you."
bipolar,fijeagi,t1_fijdr8q,1582444136.0,"Yup, I totally understand that. I managed to wake a family member but at least it wasn't everyone 😂😂"
bipolar,fijdjhc,t1_fijdidj,1582443241.0,It's so so satisfying 🤷🤷
trees,fidc44y,t1_fid2oxk,1582365242.0,"😂😂😂 Best of luck to you pal, I'm gonna keep as active as possible and just visualise moving in to keep me motivated!"
trees,ficzlid,t1_ficy48x,1582360101.0,I think I'm just apprehensive because I've never done it before. Thanks so much!
bipolar,ffcac5v,t1_ffbv5ch,1579795128.0,Thank you. I'm happy you enjoyed reading 💛
bipolar,ffca6gu,t1_ffbztb7,1579795029.0,"Thank you. I haven't done any poetry in years, this just came to me I guess"
BPD,fae8qpa,t1_fae8i9z,1575996106.0,"For sure. It's horrendous because I never want to change and be that negative person but I can't seem to get a handle on that. If anyone knows how, I'd love to be educated. 

Thank you though! That's honestly a lovely thing to say. Blessings to you💛"
BPD,fadzjtz,t3_e8jngz,1575990324.0,"I'm confident, bubbly and talkative. I'm quick whitted and love studying, working, and being social. I love working out and going to the gym and having a laugh with my gym friends. I'm creative and love drawing, painting and sculpting. I also love to read and any form of learning I'm 100% there for. I'm a loyal partner that has nothing but goodness to give not only my boyfriend, but everybody else around me. I'm a good listener and great at giving advice. 

Buuuuuut this got robbed from me like three years ago and I've been an unstable mess ever since. Sometimes the real me comes and says hi but deep down I know atm I'm still battling hard."
BPD,fadxdec,t1_fab0nri,1575988790.0,Currently going through this notion. Welp.
BPD,f9z5e8u,t3_e7at1p,1575738306.0,"Yup. Makes me selfish at times and unreliable so having friends is pretty fucking hard. I do maintain stable romantic relationships quite well, however. Dunno how they differ but🤷"
BPD,f8xswv0,t1_f8xsmq5,1574932605.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words. I've just had a big cry which felt good to do. Unfortunately my FP and family members aren't too happy with me currently because I raged at them last night and have been very stumbly this morning; Forgetting things and being slow when yesterday I was angry and fast. I cannot speak to them at the moment about it and I feel very alone. I hope you find solace soon, all my love 💛"
bipolar,f8uvqeu,t3_e29lsq,1574846790.0,Too true. Hits me like a fucking bus.
BPD,f8ibcqa,t3_e0phfq,1574586664.0,Honestly yes! It's the worst because I'm trying to write a uni assignment at the moment and I cannot for the life of me keep at it without shifting thoughts into something else. Happens with nearly everything with me. Sucks shit.
BPD,f89nx8x,t1_f89j264,1574376380.0,Literally just took it so guess we will see how it goes. Can't wait for this massive sleep 😂
BPD,f89con9,t1_f89cj76,1574370863.0,"Guess it's just anxiety because it's a new thing. Yeah I'll certainly do that, cheers."
BPD,f89b751,t1_f89b02v,1574370160.0,"I'm genuinely scared to take it, I guess I'll just have to keep an eye on it and see what happens. Thank you!"
BPD,f895h7t,t1_f895ci1,1574367342.0,"This is really insightful, thank you!"
BPD,f8956mp,t1_f893vpp,1574367188.0,Is it like a sedative?
BPD,f6w2cjb,t1_f6w26qw,1573213526.0,I'm just wanting to get better and apparently that's selfish. I just don't get it 🤦
BPD,f6w198l,t1_f6w0i94,1573212039.0,He said he understood my symptoms and wanted to help then this happens. It's all just an absolute mess
BPD,f6w0f05,t1_f6vyxdz,1573210794.0,"Yeah, there evidently is his side. Like, I get that I'm distant and the emotional switches are draining but the whole premise of needing space is to prevent me from being so draining. I'm just confused."
BPD,f6rxckf,t1_f6rwo2k,1573121758.0,"Honestly, thank you so much!!"
BPD,f6qi7kn,t1_f6qhfvf,1573077870.0,"It's the worst thing isn't it? Thank you so much, I'm so overwhelmed at your kindness.

God bless you 💛"
BPD,f6q7bmc,t1_f6q74lf,1573072150.0,"You've made me tear up by this comment alone! You will never know how much the phrase ""I'm proud of you"" means to me personally. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I've genuinely never felt this supported in all of my life 🙏🙏"
BPD,f6q1jur,t1_f6pwnvy,1573069020.0,"I have started to keep a diary and it does work, I'm so happy that you are able to see your small achievements!"
BPD,f6pw6be,t1_f6pmei3,1573065598.0,"Thank you, honestly. I'm starting to realise that it's the small things that make a big difference; I never used to think this way!"
BPD,f6pw3lj,t1_f6pk6fm,1573065552.0,Thank you! And sniffing Class A drugs like cocaine and MDMA :)
BPD,f6pfqrw,t1_f6pfdo7,1573055345.0,"This has genuinely made my day; I'd just started to dip into quite an angry couple of hours and this has really kept me driven. Nearly didn't go to work this evening but I've made the effort to get in the car and go because of your comment so thank you so, so much!"
BPD,f6pee5m,t1_f6pd97z,1573054470.0,I'm so shocked at the response! Its genuinely made me feel like I'm doing well and what I'm doing is good! Thank you 😊😊
BPD,f6p7nly,t1_f6p75ul,1573049692.0,Thank you very much! I'm sure your life will improve; Just take the smallest of steps and I promise you will get there. I am proud of you no matter what stage you are in 😊
BPD,f6p6jif,t1_f6p605l,1573048829.0,"Thank you so much! It's so fricking hard to function as a ""normal"" adult. I don't think I'll ever be able to work a 9-5, but I'm just proud I can do a little bit. I really hope your journey is going well💛"
BPD,f6p5cc3,t1_f6p53ku,1573047870.0,I am so glad I could help in some way! If you ever want to message me feel free to do so. I am here for you!
BPD,f6p4aom,t1_f6p3ux3,1573046994.0,"Mindfulness is something that has been a catalyst to all of this, so I can completely resonate with what you are saying here! I am so, so happy you have found a way to make your life work for you!! I really struggle with impulsivity and ""going fast"" and being mindful doesn't necessarily stop it, but makes me more aware of the fact it's happening which is a darn sight better than recklessly doing things, thinking it was a completely normal way to behave. It is all about compassion for yourself, I agree with you totally :)"
BPD,f6p2vrj,t1_f6p2q02,1573045730.0,"It is so so hard but I think if you get into the routine of it, it becomes second nature. Did you find that also? It's so lovely to hear from people that have made the steps and are working on themselves daily😊"
BPD,f6p24ue,t1_f6p2138,1573045035.0,You'll never know how much that means to me! God bless you🙏
BPD,f6p1soy,t1_f6p0xzv,1573044714.0,THANK YOU!! Honestly this has warmed my heart! I actually will message you because it's always great to speak to someone external that understands. Thank you so much 😋😋
BPD,f6p1qzv,t1_f6ovv0e,1573044669.0,"Yes I'm really looking forward to that! However, I know that my other half is going to find it really difficult to understand why I need my own place and I don't know how to explain him to it properly. Hopefully with the DBT I'll learn skills to be able to deal with them situations. Thank you so much for your support!"
BPD,f6ouscj,t1_f6otr6o,1573036143.0,"It is hard, but it's kind of one of those things where I have to force myself to go out and do what I've set out to do. Some days it's an absolute battle to get out of bed and when my moods are changing so quickly it is a challenge, but just being objective and knowing I'm more than what is going on in my mind and forcing myself to get out and achieve is paying off, even if I am crying uncontrollably in my car or feeling like I'm in a rage! 

Take care also, and thank you for your kindness 😇"
BPD,f6oti1k,t1_f6otglg,1573034110.0,Thank you so much! It's a conscious effort daily but I'm happy to be doing it 😊😊
BPD,f5sidcv,t1_f5shs5p,1572431920.0,"Yeah I agree, I just feel like I owe the people in this situation an explanation as to why I've got to not be with them anymore. I really need to sort all aspects of my life out and I guess I can't do that in a relationship right now. I'm scared of my behaviour if I'm totally honest, I just wanna get better."
