Anxiety,fpmeaxg,t3_gdwcei,1588731198.0,Yes I’ve dealt with misophonia basically my whole life. I get irritated by specific noises and need complete silence to focus or when I am about to fall asleep. Noises make me so angry that I begin to hyperventilate
Anxiety,foiaoyw,t1_fn8u62u,1587782313.0,"Wow, thank you for explaining what you experience in such depth. I deal with the same things. Sometimes when I’m drifting I think of terrible things that may happen to me or my friend, and then have horrible nightmares as well. It will be the most random thoughts and then I start to spiral and just start thinking of the worst things that could possibly happen. Whenever I’m alone in my apartment I think of someone coming in and kidnapping me all the time"
Anxiety,fn7o8pe,t1_fn7o1e0,1586724284.0,"I’m currently on no anxiety medications and deal with this. I just constantly wonder why I have such gruesome thoughts. It’s really worrying for me. Some of them feel like urges as well so I get even more worried. For an example I’m quarantining with one of my best guy friends right now and have been for about 3 weeks, I sometimes think of doing horrible things to him. Sometimes I think I may need to be institutionalized. Because he’s a wonderful friend and person so it does not make any sense whatsoever"
SuicideWatch,fkyn2jz,t3_fl87ug,1584652025.0,"You need to call the police, file a report and red flag your house. Physical violence is a crime and domestic abuse is not something taken lightly. He could have easily caused you a severe head injury and you could have been in critical condition. I also deal with a violent father and felt suicidal for so long because of him. The moment I started resenting my father is when I saw my brother had bruises and a swollen lip, I was young and it broke my heart. He beat up my brother. My mother stayed with him. Their relationship disgusts me. I sometimes leave my house because my dad is there, he makes me very uncomfortable. You need to make peace in your mind with him and get RID of him. Meaning, you need to find a temporary place to live or escape. Start letting people know what’s happening. It’s the only way you’ll survive. It kills me to see people suffer because of their fathers, they mess EVERYTHING UP. Remember, you or your mother don’t deserve it. Save yourself now"

I start picturing myself grabbing the gun, loading it and pointing it to either of those two places. Then I feel an overwhelming, helpless sense of urge come over me. I try to imagine actually pulling the trigger to see if it seems desirable, if it doesn’t then I’m fine and feel relieved, but it’s those times where it does feel like it’s desirable that haunts me"

Anxietyhelp,fiioq5j,t3_f7xzvd,1582424071.0,"People think anxiety is being “anxious” this is false. Being “anxious” is only a physical symptom of anxiety, there are many more aspects to anxiety. Anxiety is a way of thinking, it is a thought process. For an example, I have anxiety because of genetics, the entire side of my moms family has had anxiety, even her cousins. My brother, during a time, was experiencing weird symptoms throughout his body and thought he was severely ill, he got all types of exams possible that you can get. Nothing was found. People with anxiety think of the worst possible situation and outcome, they cannot help but going directly to that thought. Anxiety, in my opinion, is one of the most complex disorders, because you feel like you are trapped inside of your own mind. For the past week I’ve been dealing with panic and anxiety attacks, panic for hours on end, shaking, trembling, numbness and tingling, and I thought it was the end of my life. I honestly wouldn’t wish that feeling upon my worst enemy. Let him know that anxiety is a structure of thought organization, not just feeling “anxious”. That’s why it irks me when people say they have anxiety and they truly don’t, they have no idea what re current panic attacks feel like, losing sleep over them, wanting to die over them, having intrusive thoughts over and over again, feeling numb, emotionless, randomly tired for no reason. Depending on your phone, nicotine and caffeine as well as other substances to feel better. Constantly having a dark cloud over your head, feeling like your choking, stomach pain and digestive issues as well."

Suicide and death scares us so we think it’s relevant to us when it’s not. Dismiss it as an intrusive thought and keep fighting, I have to fight with urges and feeling hopeless everyday. Stay strong, these negative energies are only testing us! We all need to keep fighting. Also, please get good sleep in every night.

At the gas station my panic attack peaked where I felt my insides tingling severely like everything to the point of feeling numb. I started saying help me god help me god, over and over again, it was the scariest shit of my life. He drives me back to the emergency room and I’m so scared I’m dying.

He didn’t have a mother or father to support him well, so they took the lead. It ruined me, I completely lost it when he left. A part of me felt like it was taken. We wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. I knew it would end due to distance but I still tried my hardest. He moved back and became severely depressed and suicidal and completely changed into this person I didn’t even know. The love was always there, but the distance broke us. It was a real loss for me and effected me in ways I didn’t even know could. I’m healing, I’m getting used to my life without him. You will as well. I’m so glad you are working on yourself!

Update on my father. He took my laundry out of the dryer and left it on the floor cuz he was “looking for socks” for work this morning. I woke up and noticed all of my laundry was spread all over the floor, underwear, clothes, everything. He didn’t even bother to pick it up. He had socks to use in his drawer for work. Which makes this weird. I was shocked by this. I let my mom know and she immediately started excusing him and saying oh well he’s just looking for socks . So that gives him a right to leave my shit on the floor? Then she’s like.. well how long was your laundry in there, it was literally only there over night. And he decided to throw my laundry on the ground and not pick it up. I mean honestly insane, and she keeps defending him. She’s like he doesn’t even know whose laundry it is he doesn’t care. And so I respond , how can you let him misbehave like this? You are not sticking up for your own daughter???"

No one owes him sex, but their morals are not aligning with each other. If you are looking for a relationship you have wants and needs that you expect the other to meet. Yes you can have an emotional attachment without sex, but men feel less emotionally attached if they are rarely/ not physical at all with their partner. Especially sex, they always want to go further and if the partner is constantly rejecting them, it becomes extremely frustrating. If men aren’t getting it at home, they’ll find it somewhere else.

A big deal breaker is when your values don’t align with your partners,. You don’t feel as emotionally attached as you should and you’re freaking out about it! Sex is a part of emotional attachment. You could be obsessing with the fact of the possibility of you not loving her, when that isn’t the case whatsoever. You do love her but you are lacking a basic relationship need with her, you are a male. Let’s not sugar coat things.

survivinginfidelity,esb5j2d,t3_c6nzeo,1561778832.0,"I had a similar issue with mine, I’m his first girlfriend and we met in college. I looked through his phone one night and found sexting messages from last July and I found out 6 months after it happened. It was through Snapchat. I woke him up in the middle of the night which led to a huge argument. We were visiting his grandparents in Florida and I was floored. We are also long distance and still are. I sobbed in the bathroom. It breaks my heart that you have to go through this because I can imagine the pain and I know how the pain feels. It’s terrible. However, He blocked her and I haven’t caught him again. 

I know you don’t want to hear this, and you’re still in your honey moon phase so it will be a lot harder. But if you can (you don’t have to) let him experience how it feels to be without you. If he fights for you which he probably will, be clear of your wants and needs. And tell him that this is the deal breaker. I would ghost him, out of nowhere. Make him wonder why you aren’t responding, he will instantly start regretting everything he did and fight for you incredibly hard. I’m not saying you two are over, I’m saying draw your lines. Now, cuz he will keep thinking it’s okay if you take him back. Men love to take control in that way. I promise you. 

Also everyone in the comments thinks it’s a good idea to break up, which I think you should give him the silent treatment. I do believe couples can work through things like this. You just need to teach him the right lesson girl. Message me!"

Everyone likes to shame the response I had, but does not even consider what provoked it. I’m not rationalizing though it may sound like I am. I have expressed this same issue various times to him. So at some point when they aren’t getting the memo you have to threaten them with a split. I’m not manipulative, it’s just fucked up to not respect your partners feelings continuously. Not everyone in a relationship masters perfect communication skills. What I’ve admitted to multiple times is the fact that texting him “were done” was immature and completely unnecessary so you don’t need to go ahead and repeat your point again. 

“Stop being defensive about your bad behavior” no shit, I’ve stated in the comments multiple times that it was out of anger and completely unnecessary and that I regret it. Though, mostly everyone is saying how small and stupid the issue in generally, when it’s not, in my opinion. My reaction was a huge overreach and not cool at all, we haven’t spoken in almost three days. You happy?"
LongDistance,eqpowrz,t3_byea7o,1560202288.0,"I just want to make a last and final comment than mostly all of you have failed to see where I’m coming from. You are failing to realize that there are people bothered by it and people who are not bothered by it. You cannot shame me for being bothered by the fact that my boyfriend is following half naked girls who post slutty content on Instagram. I get the whole “as long as their looking and not touching” but you’re telling me if they had a chance to touch they wouldn’t??? Come on! Men worship these fucking women. 

I should not have reacted the way I did, but how would you feel if someone of continued to do something you didn’t like? Get a fucking grip of the real world and how social media is impacting the way people perceive reality and others. I’m done being nice to you all, and highly regret posting on here. Y’all are negative and just plain rude. I don’t need that on top of how shitty I’m feeling already."
LongDistance,eqpo28f,t1_eqhj6nl,1560201998.0,"Have anything to say? Easy for you to make that assumption that I “keep breaking up with him over little things” which I haven’t been doing at all. This is the first time I got super angry at something and said it. I think I know my relationship A WHOLE lot more than you do. Before you think you’re making a point, make sure you don’t create false assumptions about people and their actions :)"
LongDistance,eqpnpxh,t1_eqoot3p,1560201881.0,"It’s definitely not I completely agree, but I’ve told him I don’t like it before and it makes me uncomfortable. And he does it again. Honestly, that’s the thing about social media. People don’t think it’s a “big deal” when it actually is, it’s changing the way people perceive the world and others. He followed her in a sexual manner, how would that not piss me off? She’s posting half naked photos with her ass out and everything. It’s straight up disrespectful and I’m completely over these comments not being able to understand where I’m coming from. Like honestly I’m done being nice, it was stupid of me to even post on here. Y’all are straight up negative and rude as fuck"
BreakUps,eqmkbt8,t1_eqmfrwu,1560164206.0,"He sounds single now and it’s where he lives so he will go about his life as needed. Men really don’t think like women do. He doesn’t find it disrespectful to be seeing other people, it’s clear he’s moved on. But I definitely understand how you feel, it still bothers you. I would suggest finding another place to live! It will only drive you crazier"
BreakUps,eqmjlmb,t1_eqmdt0l,1560163886.0,"Everyone has different and valid reasons as to why the blocked that person. I was sexually assaulted and manipulated for two years by this guy and blocked him on everything, and still do. I chose to stop loving him, I don’t think I ever truly did and was infatuated/ manipulated. I never want to make peace or amends because of the severity. But if you’re relationship didn’t end that badly and was a mutual agreement blocking is stupid. Real love is being able to set them free and being able to see what they’re doing. It’s really about your mindset. Blocking & unblocking though creates a viscous cycle. So if you want to truly never speak to them again don’t unblock them :) cuz trust me it becomes a toxic cycle"
BreakUps,eqmimxr,t1_eqmgr2p,1560163448.0,"Really glad to hear that this worked for you and it probably will for a lot of people. But I don’t believe in blocking forever, definitely for a long period of time, but I think making peace is the best solution outcome"
intrusivethoughts,eqm652v,t1_eqlvjb6,1560157045.0,Idk like I never thought about chilling in a stair case but it felt calm and quiet and peaceful.
LongDistance,eqjr9v1,t1_eqj84xy,1560109951.0,"No I think there is a lack of understanding of where I’m coming from in the comment section.  To some it’s rational, to others, like you, think it’s irrational. There is a split opinion on following other women on Instagram/ liking other girls pictures. Yes there are different opinions on it. It’s how I react that is the problem. Since this happened I’ve asked my closest friends and others. It’s not something I want to worry about, but when I see it I get bothered by it, and it probably has some deeper causes to it. 

I’m considering breaking it off with him for some time, but currently we aren’t speaking and I would like to discuss with him where I stand. You also don’t have to tell me who to look for the next relationship whether it be local or long distance. Like you and others have been saying, I need to work on myself before a new relationship and if I become this new woman, I could probably handle long distance a whole lot better. I have a pretty clear vision of where my problems stand and it’s difficult to battle with your inner self everyday, along with loving someone else. You could form your sentences to sound way less brutal and hostile, since I’m going through a very rough time, I don’t need random people coming at me with just plain rudeness."
ROCD,eqir9z7,t3_byh2ac,1560092278.0,"Seek therapy, you seem to assume the worst and could be dealing with generalized anxiety. I don’t want to throw what it could be, out there. But he isn’t going to be the last guy you do this to if you don’t stop now. You must be peaceful within yourself if you want to have the strength to control your reactions. I’d say “just move on” and “break up” like everyone else, but this does not seem major."
ROCD,eqir197,t3_byh2ac,1560092143.0,"It’s okay, I said I wanted to break up to him over something so small the other day, which I usually don’t do. By the way he’s acting, he’s very hurt over you ending things and does not want to give you an emotional reaction. If he breaks up with you give him space and accept it, do not chase after him. Space is the best thing you can give a man."
LongDistance,eqimded,t1_eqikqze,1560089644.0,"To clarify, “Great “ as in going smooth and being happy with him after we got back together, things are changing and becoming better between us, is what i meant. I’m not contradicting myself, he has done this before and I expressed it bothers me and doing it again after everything just set me off.
You have no idea what I’ve been through in my past, these trust issues don’t just come out of no where. I’m currently seeing a therapist for anxiety so I am working on myself. Other women get bothered by their boyfriends liking another girls picture, this isn’t an irrational thing to be bothered by. Though I think my reaction was completely unnecessary. I posted on reddit to see what people had to say about my reaction so I can really see how it’s destroying my relationships. 
I’m currently out of a job and in a huge financial crisis, I have a lot of other stressors along with long distance and it may just be too much for me to handle at this point. I can’t live like this worrying this much. It’s really hard to work on yourself during a relationship, when you have anxiety as well. I’ve been diagnosed just recently. But thank you!"
LongDistance,eqijqfd,t1_eqhj6nl,1560088275.0,"I’ve actually never broken up with him before. I have anxiety and am currently seeing a therapist for it. I’ve been through hell and back with this man. I’m disappointed that mostly everyone in the comments are making incorrect assumptions about my actions. I’m not the kind of person who breaks up with the partner back and forth. I’m always willing to work it out, but this is something I’m truly bothered with so it set me off."
LongDistance,eqihx5i,t1_eqhud39,1560087317.0,"I never really used to care this much. In my past relationships I’ve been cheated on, even with some of my closest friends. I found out this guy I was seeing /sleeping with for awhile, was doing it with multiple other women at the same time and seeing his ex. What I’m disappointed in the comments here is a lack of understanding of where I’m coming from. If I’m getting so mad at these little things, it obviously has deep roots and I am currently seeing a therapist about this. Used to being worried about other women constantly. 

I’m his first girlfriend and there’s definitely a lack of trust between us cuz of our past. It’s a thought pattern that I can only get rid of. It’s sad to see that I’m the one creating such a toxic relationship. I’m clearly not over the past and if I can’t get over it then it needs to be done for good. It will just continue to be a cycle. I realized my post makes me sound extremely annoying/ insecure and dependent as well."
LongDistance,eqigs60,t1_eqhs0b2,1560086680.0,"I’m listening, and considering, in fact. I understand that it’s unhealthy behavior, why would I even bother to post it on here if I wasn’t looking to listen to 2nd opinions? Saying “just break up” is not good advice in my opinion. There’s a lot more things that need to be considered. I’m getting such negative feedback and I just wasn’t expecting this much."
LongDistance,eqgtl8j,t1_eqgtg1o,1560042425.0,I appreciate your comment. I’ve been doing LDR for well over a year now hoping to close the distance soon. It’s hard especially with all the other stressors I have currently.
LongDistance,eqgth88,t1_eqgt207,1560042358.0,"Yes, it is toxic I agree but, he’s the one that has done it before. I feel like it was a retaliation kind of thing, but I don’t know it really bothered me and I just got super irritated! Anger brings out the worst in people. He knew I wasn’t being serious but, it isn’t healthy you’re right."
LongDistance,eqgt9nu,t1_eqgsgfu,1560042232.0,"I love how you’re all so positive! Instead of working on things you suggest a breakup which honestly makes me feel worse. With any guy I feel like I would be bothered. It’s the act itself that bothers me. He went out with his friends and though I’m scared he met someone else I DOUBT he cheated on me, and I’m not thinking that far. We’ve actually like Ive said, been doing amazing since we got back together and really aren’t the kind of couple that is constantly on and off. Just because I have insecurities and have been cheated on in my past, does not mean that it’s “irrational”."
LongDistance,eqgsxar,t1_eqgseim,1560042053.0,"Okay basically, I wasn’t completely serious. I wanted to see if he would reach out and ask me why I was ending things to make it clear that it bothers me. To you it might be small, but EVERYONE is different. Like I’ve said above, other people have said it would bother them and some that say it doesn’t matter. You’re speaking like I’m the only girlfriend who is bothered with that? I do need to work on my insecurities but I have felt like this for far too long. He has been doing this and I’ve expressed to him it bothers me prior."
LongDistance,eqgshbt,t1_eqgscuy,1560041823.0,"Yeah, I agree it was a pretty extreme reaction. I am just unbelievably frustrated that it’s long distance. It’s really taking a toll on me and I’m in love with him"

LongDistance,eqgs3mo,t1_eqgrz5h,1560041625.0,Well it’s weird because some people are saying they’d be bothered too and some saying that it doesn’t matter. I’m just bothered by it

Anxietyhelp,eq92db3,t1_eq776gr,1559883381.0,No I haven’t. It’s had terrible side effects and reviews so why would I do that to myself? I just don’t know why she prescribed that and I’m pretty angry at it
