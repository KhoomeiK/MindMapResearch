birthcontrol,fn5s8ux,t3_fzoc4d,1586674124.0,"I had the mirena for only 5 months before switching to COCP. My skin broke out in CCs during this 5 monthsâ€™ time when it had always been smooth and non-problematic even with the amount of makeup I used daily. The discharge I was warned about by my Dr so I wasnâ€™t too surprised by it but the skin side effects took me by surprise. 

I tried to bear with the mirena, by double cleansing and using more active skin products to combat the acne but I eventually swapped to the pill which ultimately saved my skin. I only have the acne scars to deal with now."

I have combo dehydrated oily skin that is prone to redness. Iâ€™ve tried their most popular first essence a couple of years ago and decided it really didnâ€™t do much but Iâ€™m hopeful with this one"

AustralianMakeup,fjwl4st,t1_fjwkh4a,1583640533.0,"I dont get much or any residue from this but then again I donâ€™t spray too much on and only focus on the scalp which is where I get the most oily. I spray it onto the scalp after sectioning the hair, then I brush to distribute. My pillowcases are blush pinks and blues and I dont see anything on them. I have very long hair almost reaching my butt."

I try not to use dry shampoo too much because my scalp gets flakey between washes but I have used batiste, klorane and cedel brands"
AusSkincare,fhzg3cq,t1_fhrcqx0,1581998601.0,"This property here is exactly why I love the premium (the gold bottle) more than the plain gokujyun lotion (white bottle). I love how plump it makes my face, and also as a result of the ultra hydration it makes me less oily. The white bottle would absorb way too quickly on my skin and leaves my skin dry, consequently making me feel like itâ€™s not doing much for me.

If you dislike the tacky feeling I would recommend switching to the white bottled hada labo gokujyun lotion."

1) capsule them for each season/colour palette. See if I can get a theme going.

MakeupRehab,ewxxujv,t1_ewxx3x0,1565870754.0,"Mostly you start with what you have now.
1) Whats your current skin and hair like?
2) Whats lacking? What is the goal? Why are you buying?
3) What do you think more products will achieve? What is realistically achievable with more/newer products?
4) Go back to question one. 

Skin/haircare shopping can be a never ending endeavour if you dont know what your end goal is and especially if you were never happy with your current state."

Once I wet my hair I then use my medicated shampoo (usually either salicylic acid or coal tar ones) just in the scalp. I try to leave the shampoo on for a while before rinsing, but by the time I rinse it all off I try to get the lather down to the ends as well. 

This is what I do to get both my scalp healthy and my hair ends soft and hydrated (and less haywire-y) without product build-up because I have high porosity strands."

Due to my hair texture I dont brush my hair, even tho it is is good for scalp circulation; I simply do a lengthy scalp massage in the shower with this product then rinse it clean and finish with conditioner for my hair tips."
