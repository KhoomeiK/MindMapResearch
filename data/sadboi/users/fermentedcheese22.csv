introvert,fr0pky7,t3_gluyy6,1589803369.0,">when i say no i dont want to socialise they take it personally and feel the need to always be like why!?

This reminds me of my time with my ex. Whenever I told her that I don't feel like socialising with others, she would automatically assume that I'm being grumpy and moody, when in reality I only wanted to either spend some time alone or doing something with her. Mind you, I tried explaining this to her several times but it only made things worse.

What I suggest is to try and explain to them how you feel. Be honest and tell them that it's not because you don't enjoy hanging out with them, but that you need to have some time alone to recharge. Try to find a compromise with them so that everyone's happy. Using a calm, relaxed and happy tone when discussing this should make things easier as well."

On another note, him wanting to be a person on which people can rely on isn't a bad thing in my opinion, as long as he doesn't gloat or take unnecessary pride from it.

I don't blame you for giving up on him though, especially if he was overwhelming. In my opinion, he doesn't seem like a bad person. Maybe he's still trying to figure himself out. That's my own personal two cents on the matter."

AskReddit,fqer8jz,t1_fqd0kfr,1589312268.0,"I want to start off the reply by thanking you for your kind words. They really mean a lot to me.

\>  The way you approach this is incredibly mature and well-adjusted. That being said, you are still allowed to feel hurt. What you went through sounds incredibly mentally and emotionally draining, and repeated passive-aggressive manipulation to get you to do what she wants, without any regard for your feelings, is *definitely* not nothing.

I'm incredibly humbled by this paragraph. In reality, I'm so scared of being labeled as a toxic partner that I sometimes ignore my own feelings. Then, whenever I decide to stand up for myself, I feel intense guilt. This goes beyond romantic relationships, but that is where the feeling feels the most intense.

I think the whole thing hurts so much is that I never oblige anyone to do anything for me, regardless of whether it's for love or simply respect. I hate forcing people to do something that pleases only me. It makes me feel like a cruel tyrant.

\>  Some of those ""faults"" are things you never, ever would have done in a normal healthy relationship, they were your response to extreme circumstances.

If I'm being honest with myself, I completely agree with this, in the sense that the majority of my shortcomings were truly caused by an external factor. During our relationship, my life was constantly changing and I felt lost at times. She helped me stay on track and for that I am eternally grateful.

There were of course moments where I should've done things differently, or where I was outright in the wrong. I always apologised with honesty and tried to atone for my mistakes in various ways.

Overall, I can't really say that it was a toxic relationship. The last few months definitely were though, and I wasn't able to fully acknowledge it. When we broke up, she mentioned that I'll never be good enough for a relationship. Looking back at the unconditional love I had towards her, and all the sacrifices I endured for her, it's a very disrespectful and hurtful thing to say.

\>  Being a little gentler on yourself can go a long way. What you went through is bad, and you're allowed to feel hurt by the mistreatment you went through. Nobody is perfect in a relationship, ever, and that doesn't invalidate what you went through.

This paragraph summarizes everything perfectly, and it honestly feels incredibly wholesome and reassuring.

Your experience has definitely helped, thank you so much. I genuinely wish you nothing but the very best."

AskReddit,fqcjmql,t1_fqbsdrb,1589259943.0,"Thank you for pointing all this out.

To be honest, I'm not going to say that it was a bad relationship but there were moments where I felt hurt. She was the one who initiated the breakup too, because she felt like I wasn't giving her enough. I've actually been doing a lot reflection, both from my end and her end. I don't want to repeat the same mistakes and I want to know what to look out for in future relationships.

The issue was me being an introvert. She expected me to accompany her everywhere she went. At first I didn't mind because it gave me an excuse to hang out with her. Then after a while, it slowly started getting to me big time. 

My life was going through several changes at the time which I had little to no control over. She made me feel inadequate as a partner for not wanting to attend social events with her. I still ended up attending each event, but my behaviour during some of these events showed that I wasn't happy to be there at all.

I explained to her countless times that I'm not comfortable with it. She started telling me that if I really loved her, I would be willing to comply with her. Even writing down the phrase increases my anxiety levels. Having your love being put into question hurts a lot and made me feel very guilty. I felt like I was inadequate and that I had to find ways to make up for it.

I ended up suppressing a lot of things which I wasn't happy about because she usually turned it all round to me. I'm not the sort of person who keeps mental lists of ways in which someone hurt me or stuff like that, so I didn't want to tell her something and then she calls my bluff over it.

Deep down I know that I wasn't the perfect partner and that I have plenty of shortcomings as well. I'm not even gonna try to hide it. My problem is that at this point in time I'm riddled with guilt. Journaling helped me realise that she wasn't as ideal as I pictured her to be. Whenever we got into an argument, she tended to say hurtful words through a passive aggressive tone. Meanwhile I on the other hand, used to raise my voice but I honestly don't remember myself saying anything out of line (I come from a loud background but I'm still not proud of any of this).

Deep down, I've acknowledged the fact that the breakup was for the best. I have no doubt about it. What I'm feelng right now focuses on me, my shortcomings and my introversion. My self esteem was always on the low side but now too low. Subconsciously her words still ring around my mind, waiting to throw me off-guard at the first opportunity, resulting in me staring blindly at something while going through details of the event in my mind.

I apologise for the long reply. Sometimes I feel like I'm blowing my feelings out of proportion or that I don't have the right to feel hurt because I wasn't perfect either. Talking about it definitely helps though, so thank you for sharing your thoughts in your earlier reply."

Also, although I understand why some women prefer to vent freely without receiving any form of advice, there has to be clear communication about this. Just like you said, men are fixers so it's natural for us to try and find a solution. If however you expect your boyfriend to listen, it's better to talk to him about it rather than blowing him off.

unpopularopinion,fq2129c,t1_fq1chnp,1589051880.0,"I get this. My ex and I suffered from this a lot. Overall I tended to keep things in my personal life to myself in order not to overload her with my problems. However, whenever I decided to open up to her, she rarely offered a solution or offered one which couldn't be met.

Contrary to this, whenever she vented to me, I tried offering her solutions to her problems given that I had experienced some of them a few months earlier and was able to overcome them. Rather than telling me to stop and let her vent, she simply said that I don't get her and that I'm doing a poor job at being supportive which at the time hurt a lot.

However, there were also times when she indirectly told me to deal with it and stop acting like a child whenever I felt hurt or disappointed towards her. It genuinely sucked and I considered it to be highly disrespectful.

If you feel hurt whenever she tells you to man up, then I highly suggest that you sit down with her and have a lengthy talk. Explain to her how you feel and how this is affecting you as calmly and as lovingly as possible and listen to what she has to say. Don't let this get out of control because believe me, it will."
