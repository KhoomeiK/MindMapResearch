mtgfinance,fqv3vsr,t3_gks3i0,1589669353.0,"I personally play cEDH ever since Legacy events became very scarce.  I mean I have duals and leds and all and I barely get to use them, so I made some small investments and turned my already owned EDH decks into cEDH decks with my legacy cards + some extra's that I bought (e.g. wheel of fortune, mana crypt, mana vault).

This has been the case for most of the people I know from our local legacy group, they all play commander now and they all have relatively high power cards due to legacy, so everyone plays cEDH now. Especially since the coronavirus we've been playing a lot over discord/whereby and thus also been buying new cards.

So in short I guess that part of it are people porting over from modern/legacy to commander expecting the same high power from those formats in EDH. It's probably a small portion of the percentage points gain of new cEDH players but it can be taken into account."

First of all the number of people to have best friends for over some years is way smaller than most would expect. Friendships die out for various reasons, losing interest in certain hobbies or activities, work, moving away, marriage etc... So it's not something even most of us get to experience anyway. 

Second of all, it's not your fault. You can't force people to bond with you more than others and that's ok. You couldn't be best friends with someone who would force it unto you as well if you think about it.

Third of all, best friends don't differ that much from overall good friends. I mean for most it's just a word.

  
You can live a good life without a best friend, but I know that some things are very hard to accept and sometimes impossible. It took me several years to cope with not having a best friend or not being that friend someone calls to. Once you can accept that you can kind of ""move on"".

EDIT: a word"

I didn't play the dragon version but instead opted for a disinformation campaign build with nicky b's and thought erasures.

The deck was really sweet to play and aims to outvalue your opponent in both boardstate and card advantage. My manabase was still really greedy wich costed me some losses.

The list looked somewhat like this:

4 nicol bolas, the ravager

2 Jace VP

3 brazen borrower

2 murderous rider

1 bonecrusher giant

2 doom whisperer

1 scarab god

4 thoughtseize

4 thought erasure

2 drown in the loch

4 fatal push

3 disinformation campaign

1 kolaghan's command

2 dig through time

4 blood crypt

4 steam vents

4 watery grave

4 drowned catacombs

1 dragonskull summit

1 sulfur falls

3 fabled passage

2 swamp

1 island

1 mountain

SIDE

3 noxious grasp

3 collective brutality

2 abrade

2 mystical dispute

2 disdainful stroke

2 languish

1 anger of the gods

Obviously the manabase is a bit trash but I made the deck in like 5 minutes. I'd cut 3-4 shocks and put in some extra summit/sulfur falls and basics.

This deck is different than most lists as it uses disinformation campaign as a value engine, forcing you to play 4 thought erasure. This absolutely destroys control though (I playtested lots of times with friends, very hard to lose).

Fast aggro decks are an issue since they don't care about repetitive discard, therefor you need extra answers from the side and maybe some sweepers like ritual of sooth.

This deck can curve extremely well, going thoughtseize into thought erasure into disinformation campaign into nicol bolas is usually game. Top it off with doom whisperer for extra value (this card overperformed like hell for me, absolute powerhouse and gained some value now Oko is gone).

Wandering fumarole might be an option but I fear that curving out smoothly is more important so my lands need to come in untapped if needed. Fabled passage is an exception here, post turn 3 it's pretty good anyway and it activates revolt on push.

Overall the deck seems viable, I need to playtest it some more obviously but I think it's okay. Also last but not least, the adventure creatures are insane value. I might swap bonecrusher for something else since the 2 dmg is not always as relevant but murderous rider and especially brazen borrower are insane. Bounce something and then discard it with TS/TE/DC has been a common sight in this deck.

It's also a blast to play so I'd say go for it."

mtgfinance,fa9wbbw,t3_e85edi,1575894508.0,"Played in an event that fired modern and vintage on Saturday and legacy and pioneer on Sunday. I played modern and legacy.

In short: Oko is still real in modern, legacy and vintage but not as much in Pio, Modern and Legacy are still very popular (in Europe atleast) and Vintage remains the gentleman's format. Sell into Pio hype and buy into modern/legacy.

Legacy had the biggest turnout, vintage had 8 people, modern and pioneer had an average turnout.

Regarding Pioneer, the most represented decks were Simic Nexus and u/W control with a shoutout to G/B hardened scales. Oko was nowhere to be seen here, aggro/monored was also barely presented. 0 phoenix decks, 0 deathrite shamans, 0 delirium decks.

Regarding Modern, a lot of urza and death shadow variants. Bant control with Oko did really well, the deck is basically the modern variant of legacy bant miracles. Basically UW splashing green for oko, veil and icefang coatl. Especially burn gets hosed by oko decks but then again it can be good against death shadow. Valakut with field also did quite well.

Regarding Legacy, there were two groups of people here: 1. people who follow the meta and adjust there decks and 2. people who have ""their"" legacy deck and will always play that deck with some adjustments if needed. Oko was present in BUG delver and Miracles but ANT, Dredge and lands variants were also present. There were also painter decks, burn etc. regarding group 2. Urza decks are slowly on the rise as well, confirming that mox opal and urza will always have a home here if either one of those cards would be banned in modern.

Vintage was vintage, oko was there to make some 3/3 black lotus's but there's just so little people that can afford the format (it looked awesome though).

Hope this was helpful."

I was at Richmond a few weeks ago where not a single vendor was willing to buy any legacy staples of me (talking about sneak attack, intuition etc). They deemed the format ""dead"" with Pioneer + SCG replacing their Legacy event with Pioneer.

I'm sure the format won't ""die out"" like many are saying but I can see a drop in popularity because of Pioneer and big MTG events switching legacy events to pio events and I'm wondering how that'll affect prices.

Ironically legacy staples dropping could mean that the format will be more accessible for others and thus gain popularity.

Contrary to popular belief, Modern is quite accessible if you don't fancy midrange or control and even then there are budget options to those strategies that are still competitive. Combo and Aggro will always be cheaper. An even bolder statement, but so is Legacy (if you remember that you're playing a hobby and also the fact that hobbies are expensive).
2. I dabble in mtgfinances from time to time and buy/sell certain cards at their high or low points. This way I can lie to myself as how I'm ""making"" money while playing the game. In truth I can only cover some of my expenses by being careful when buying and selling certain cards, but it's nice to break-even every once and a while (for instance selling some spiked cards and using that cash for future mtg products). I basically see this as another hobby as I really like finding good deals on fleamarkets etc in general. Another factor is enjoyability. I'll pay a little extra if I enjoy a certain playstyle or strategy, I have the funds for it and I'll have fun playing it so why not (for instance playing UW control instead of storm).
3. Basically what I explained above, sometimes I sell entire decks when I don't play them anymore or need funds for other cards. I already spent thousands already and nowadays like to keep my costs to a minimum so selling cards I don't use for other cards I will use brings me to a nice status quo and no further expenses, if I sell more than needed then that's just a little bonus. I also used to sell my entire standard decks some months before rotation just to recoup some of the money and use it to build my next standard deck but nowadays I only play draft, modern and legacy. When drafting I always sell my standard staples almost immediately to fund my other mtg expenses.
4. I've started collecting during Rise of The Eldrazi back when I worked at a local toystore and got hooked on the artwork. Started actively playing since KTK and have been playing ever since. Magic has gotten cheaper for me as my playgroup used to buy a box per person from an LGS for €110 and now buy them from an online vendor for €80. We use these for drafts and almost always go break-even from the things we open or win at the end of the night, and €7 for a draft and a good night with friends is basically peanuts anyway. Stopping with standard or atleast selling my decks before rotation and ""investing"" in modern and legacy decks over time also made my hobby so much cheaper as I don't spend as much on rotating formats anymore and if I need cash quick I can always sell some modern or legacy stuff.
5. Just the one really, especially in older formats where knowledge and skill of your own deck/the meta is more important than buying into the new best decks and having little to no experience with it. This is also the reason you see way more people with pimped up decks in Modern and Legacy. For Standard one deck is also fine but be prepared to change it often during the time it's legal as the meta shifts way faster than eternal formats.
6. Lending and renting decks. Rent a deck a few times for €5 - €10 or so depending on the deck, this way you can keep up with the meta, don't need to do all the changes and you can eventually buy the deck if you want when you're sure you like the playstyle and can afford it.

In general I hope people just remember that it's still a hobby, too many people for some reason have the opinion that MTG should be profitable and that the sealed lottery tickets should always be in your favor by opening big $$ cards. I think this is due to the fact that MTG is one of the few hobbies where some of your product can go up in value after you bought it and can sell it afterwards with profit, but this is only the case for maybe 5% of the cards before rotation. It's still a hobby, it's still a game, you enjoy it while playing it. You don't expect your money back when buying into the settlers of Catan, don't expect your money back when playing MTG even though you easily can in some occasions."

I kind of get both sides, I wouldn't personally dq someone for bumping in a judge when hurrying to your seat in a gp, I mean who hasn't been bumped at least 20 times when going to the pairings or to your seat. But then again I'm not a big fan of shaming someone on the internet and he could've complained about it without naming the judge so eh. As always we should let the people involved handle it since I'm sure 99% here wasn't even there."

Cast it and saw 3 TKS and tron in hand, he had a mine and wastes on the battlefield.

After his turn playing his third land and something irrelevant my turns turned out like this:

- attack with clique, cryptic draw bounce your land
- attack with clique, cryptic draw bounce your land
- attack with clique, snap cryptic draw bounce your land
- attack with clique and snap, snap another cryptic draw bounce your land

Best game I've ever played, it's too much fun when you're beating down as control."
mtgfinance,eufmgw6,t1_euf47vx,1563780786.0,People tend to forget that mtg cards are also a collectible. What's the point in buying rare collectible cards if they're not rare at all. Don't get me wrong I get your frustration playwise but a considerable amount of people buy mtg as collectibles and a more agressive reprint policy could destroy that market.

mtgfinance,erwyj2n,t3_c4gpim,1561362296.0,"A theory around the difference in price between Horizon Canopy and the newer Canopy lands is the colors in which you want to use these lands.

G/W as a colorpair has almost no carddraw and needs the Canopy the most whereas u/R has lots. This is why Humans plays 4x Canopy and Storm plays it 1x.

Future testing could lead into more canopy lands overall but for the moment decks that already have lots of carddraw (see Blue/Red aligned decks) won't really use these as a 4-of which keeps the price in check (for now)."

spikes,er54a4p,t1_er520mc,1560517676.0,"Even considering you have all those spells available in your games, you need to pair them with a really fast clock (having one or two tarmo's for instance). Ghost Quarter and Assassin's Trophy still provide them basics which they'll use for Oblivion stone, Traghtusk, wurmcoil and the like.

Even if you get lucky enough to GQ a tronpiece and surgical it you're still down on cards and they'll reach 5-6 mana eventually if they keep hitting landdrops.

&#x200B;

In short:

\- GQ still provides them a land, leaving you one short

\- AT also provides them a land in any scenario (using it on tronpieces or walkers/artifacts)

\- Surgical is good but straight up card disadvantage

&#x200B;

Even if you get lucky with the fast land destruction into surgical I've found to be too slow most of the times to finish the game against tron. All this is not even taking into account that you almost always lose game 1 anyway so you have to get lucky twice afterwards.

&#x200B;

It's winnable, but it's a horrible, horrible matchup."

ModernMagic,er4ph6z,t1_er3ukgv,1560503328.0,"I don't know but IMO if you can afford a tier 1 modern deck you can afford a legacy deck, especially if you have some pieces in modern already (for instance miracles).

Of course some decks are stupid expensive but like in any format there are budget decks and budget replacements for still competitive decks (e.g. u/B death shadow, u/W miracles, u/R delver, Burn, High tide, Reanimate...)."
spikes,er4l8jb,t1_er46uw7,1560496813.0,"I've played abzan for some amount of time in modern and I could never make it work against control, I decided to just shift to control and I've never lost a game against midrange.

The problem I found with Abzan is that you have two miserable matchups, TRON and UW/x control and you can't focus on one matchup without losing to the other.

The GB/x package is really good against almost every other deck though where your cards just outvalue other strategies, but there's a lot of UW en TRON now so I don't see it being really good atm."
