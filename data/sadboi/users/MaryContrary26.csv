Honestly, it's a wonderful thing to practice anyway because there will always be negativity around us and it's useful to learn how to protect ourselves.

EatingDisorders,fluyux6,t3_fr4qhq,1585512875.0,"I'm afraid that any attempt to control your weight is risky. I would shift your perspective. If you're stress eating, maybe you could focus on controlling your stress instead. If you're eating out of boredom, maybe address the boredom. Tackle the issues that are contributing to your eating behavior instead of that whole I want to lose weight mindset because people like us who have eating disordered histories are a little too good at controlling our weight if we get into that mindset.

fuckeatingdisorders,fiz5zo7,t3_fado5q,1582854954.0,If you restrict consider how that affects your brain and numbs your emotions. So you might not even know what you're avoiding until you recover enough to think clearly and feel your feelings.

fuckeatingdisorders,fhqw51k,t3_f483no,1581812551.0,This is exactly how I felt one day about 15 years ago and that was the end of the eating disorder. You have no idea how powerful you are until you really make this decision. You're going to do it!

EatingDisorders,fg0w01x,t3_evlap5,1580416116.0,"Yes, full recovery does exist and I was about as severe as it gets. It took a long time though. My story will of course be different than anyone else's but ...I stopped resisting ""negative"" emotions and I didn't push any emotional pain away. I focused on being in my heart and allowing whatever was there. So when I was sad or angry or anxious, instead of using behaviors I just let myself be sad or angry or anxious. Interesting thing--it was much less difficult to suffer a wave of discomfort (and it does pass) than the eating disorder because in the eating disorder you're disconnected and that feels creepy. Much worse than just feeling the pain. Years later, I feel much more joy than pain. I think my brain chemistry actually changed-maybe from self-care because I protect myself. I never restrict, always get enough sleep, love my work, indulge my passions, have a spiritual life and try to help others and I do think we need to help others for our own wellness. xx ."
EatingDisorders,ffxykq5,t3_evq3ji,1580334963.0,"Be patient, it will come in time. For now, I would just focus on nutritionally balanced meals and try to incorporate some of your fear foods if you can. So for example, this week for dinner I had--ravioli stuffed with cheese, topped with tomato sauce with a side salad one night, fried chicken with rice and cauliflower one night, steak, baked potato and brussel sprouts one night and tonight I'm actually going out for an office dinner and I'll probably order whatever the waiter recommends.

EatingDisorderHope,fb7es6v,t3_ealfac,1576587618.0,You know it's ironic that you kind of have to recover enough to even be able to see how sick you are. Why? Because the brain needs nutrition to be able to think clearly and your eating disorder voice is raging right now with no one to challenge it. Of course it's telling you that you're not sick enough! It's sole purpose is to harm you. But the part of you that found the courage to walk through that door does want to recover.
eating_disorders,fb6brrk,t3_ebb99z,1576546383.0,"It happened to me too. My first go round with an eating disorder taught me so much about myself and I grew so much from the experience. The 2nd time? Nothing. It taught me nothing. It was just a colossal  waste of time that I could have spent actually living. (Btw, spell check changed eating disorder to earring disorder.

EatingDisorders,f9l5nf0,t3_e58a89,1575415025.0,"Maybe think of it this way-If let's say you were a recovering alcoholic. Your friends could understand how you might feel.Okay, we can't go to a bar because she will want a drink and it's an addiction for her. Okay. Makes sense. But people who haven't had an eating disorder really don't get it because the thoughts and behaviors are so foreign to them, so bizarre that they can't relate. For example: You're afraid of that banana???!! What? You're joking, right? Wtf! They really can't understand. So it's perfectly normal for your friends to talk about their bodies or food in everyday conversation and can you ask them not to? I guess but it's a pretty big part of normal life and they may forget that it's taboo because it's such a common topic to not be able to talk about occasionally. If they talk about it frequently yeah, it's a problem (maybe even an ED) but to accuse them of hurting your feelings?  You're setting the bar too high."

eating_disorders,f7vwhg7,t1_f7vvhj9,1574027683.0,I'm not sure what you mean. Boost or Ensure are meal replacement drinks you can buy in the supermarket or drug store or probably on line. Comes in bottles. They're like drinking a creamy milkshake but they're packed with nutrients.

EatingDisorders,f3i5wac,t3_dgx7a9,1570932635.0,I felt heavy depression from gaining weight in recovery. But the depression didn't have that nightmarish quality that comes with starvation. Remember how it felt? It was like living in this other dimension where you're always afraid and you never feel grounded. It's like you're disconnected from yourself and everyone else. Well I chose the depression and just plowed through. And eventually it lifted and I was able to feel valued for non weight related reasons . I just want you to know that if you stick it out your brain will eventually shift back to normal.
EatingDisorderHope,f1ksmqk,t3_d9nu93,1569539835.0,If you can't eat enough you could try drinking Boost or Ensure. Lots of them.
fuckeatingdisorders,f0wxg0i,t3_d6zrjj,1569015970.0,Most of the people in recovery programs aren't underweight. They're there because the eating disorder has taken over their life.  No one deserves to have an eating disorder. It's a living hell. I don't care what you weigh. You should have a life.  I wish you recovery. I wish you peace.

fuckeatingdisorders,etdl0if,t3_cavz2m,1562709002.0,Actually there are different levels of recovery and it is possible to be free from the thoughts. It sounds like you're getting by but not quite there and it might be a good idea to have a few therapy sessions to get past this hurdle. I guess having children would count as a major life event so I can tell you that I had 2 after recovery and never thought about my weight for a moment. I was just so over the moon that I could have children. Is there any way you can focus on how incredible it is to be starting this new life with someone you love?
fuckeatingdisorders,etav25q,t3_calpzl,1562629922.0,"I started doing serious spiritual work and connecting with the self that doesn't change.

eating_disorders,es98zif,t3_c6ecqb,1561730514.0,"Well, your body is telling you it needs more food (or liquid nutrition if your digestive system isn't functioning properly). Should you be worried? Yeah because you're stressing your heart and bones. I mean there's a lot more damage to worry about but the heart is the most immediate. I permanently damaged my hunger hormones so I have to rely on other signals to determine if I'm ""hungry"" and dizziness means I'm very hungry."
EatingDisorders,erwa5de,t3_c4c6q3,1561337608.0,"Oh you have no idea! When I was in my eating disorder I obsessed about everyone's weight, including family and friends. I was disgusted by overweight people and even many normal weight people who weren't thin. I even lost a friend over it. But the thing is, it was the disorder. It was hunger and want and frustration that they could do what they wanted and not care. I can honestly say that I'm now back to not having any reaction  to other people's bodies  (really!) but that didn't happen until years after recovery. Don't underestimate the power of the disorder."
EatingDisorders,erqu37e,t3_c3e5yz,1561152087.0,"Just so you know, it takes a while for the metabolism to heal but when it does, the weight gain will level off and eventually the extra weight will drop off. It's part of the recovery process. Focus on behavior, not results."

You know you don't really look like either one so maybe try to remember that what you see in your mirror isn't reality either. It took years after I recovered to finally be able to see what I really looked like and it was shocking to me that I thought I was so much bigger than I was.

I recovered the first time because I was literally days away from dying and when death wasn't just a concept anymore, it freaked me out. I recovered the second time because even though I was alive, I wasn't living. I went from feeling superior to everyone who had a few extra pounds on them to feeling jealous that they had freedoms I didn't have. I've been recovered for a long time now and I would never consider going back to that hellish dimension. (If that helps) And yes, I did suffer permanent damage to my bones and hormones but luckily not to my heart."
