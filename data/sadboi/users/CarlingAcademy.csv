BipolarReddit,fgf1mky,t1_fg2vs3d,1580719527.0,">It does feel good.... until you do something embarrassing, lol, which happens a lot with this illness, unfortunately.

I've been in therapy for a long was time and when I was in my upper teens I was in a group which helped me to learn how to not feel ashamed. That has helped so much. Being bp2 and only hypomanic has also helped me keep down the embarrassing stuff. Except for my sexapedes in my late teens and early twenties which is somewhat annoyingly guilt inducing since I know I shouldnt feel bad about it, but people are so god damn judgy! Being here and hear about other people's sky high libido is very reassuring though!

In my city there are free support groups for SOs of people with mental health problems, sort of like the support groups for family of AA participants. 

I hope you guys get back on track again. Talking too each other can be hard, but good communication can really be helpful. Small tip: if it's hard for either of you to open up - what I do is, firstly, we only talk at night, secondly, turn of the lights. There is something with the dark that makes it easier, at least for me. And thirdly, if no. 1 and 2 doesn't work we also usually sit with our backs turned against each other and talk. This really helps in my experience. I carry a lot of shame inside and looking into my SOs eyes when I say something I think will make him despise me is just too hard.

You say that you're taking your meds and everything is fine, but I would just like to point out that every one of your thoughts are thoughts I have when I'm starting to slip in to depression. Just something to think about. 

You need to have a heart to heart with your SO. Find out what's going through their head. Without arguing or judging. It's hard. The most important thing to always say what you mean and not try to minimize or alter what you want your SO to understand. 

Me and my SO tries to use a technique called non-violent communication. Basically that means that we structure our conversations in this way: 

SO - Right now I feel x because of y. 
Me - Okay, when you say x and y I understand it as a and b, is that right?
SO - Yes, exactly/No, what I mean is..."

AmItheAsshole,ffgg9fh,t1_fff6f3j,1579905551.0,"Okay, so, here is the thing about bipolar. It's extremely common that once you get stable using meds, you stop believing you're bipolar. And if you don't think you're sick, why take medication at all? This is a huge part of this disease, and combined with that it only comes in cycles which means that you can even go years without an episode - staying on medication is really hard. 

On top of that - medication is not nearly enough to have a normal life when you're bipolar. You have to have impeccable sleep hygiene, healthy diet, you need to exercise, go to therapy, get regular blood work done, practise mindfulness, not drink alcohol or do any drugs, not smoke, stay away from triggers, eat your medication every day at the same time and for most of us several times a day. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. 

Yes, he is responsible for himself but the difference is that he's not able to take that responsibility right now. He seems deeply depressed based on OPs post, he has no support system to speak of. I can promise you that he keeps pushing his family away because he feels like he have to do everything himself but it's simply impossible so he has fallen down an endless well of guilt more or less. This makes it even harder to start eating medication again. 

Depression, especially in bipolar, can be extremely dangerous. It literally convinces your brain that depressed is the new normal, and not only that, it's the only normal you've ever felt and the only normal you ever will feel. This is a big reason for why suicide rates for people with bipolar is ~20-25% higher than for neurotypicals. 

I agree, he should take an active role in his treatment. It's just not as simple as that.

NoStupidQuestions,ffevc7m,t1_ffei9l3,1579867119.0,"A good rule of thumb is to end the sentence when you have to breathe while reading it out loud. It's also a good idea to vary the length of your sentences to make it easier and more enjoyable for the reader. Here is a text written by Gary Provost to exemplify my last statement:


This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important."

But it's not a real diary, just a regular note book with a beautiful cover! I write down the date in the top right corner whenever I use it to keep track. This also allows me use as much or as little space I want to each day! 

I just started on antidepressant so the last 3 weeks I've written quite a lot about my side effects and how I experience them, if they're severe or not so I can keep track if my depression is getting better or worse and also to be on the look out for hypomania. 

I didn't like daylio either, right now I'm using Mood path which I really like. You get to answer a few simple yes/No questions about symptoms, choose your mood (with smilies like daylio) and there's also space for commentary. In the comments I usually just write what's on my mind, sort of like a diary. Right now I'm way depressed so I write a lot about which specific topic I racing through my mind and keeping me from finding any kind of balance. Every week you get a summary of your mood and your symptoms, and you can also see statistics for the month. 

I like it cause I can track my mood during the day. It notifies you 3x day (I think you can lower it if it's too much) and if you don't want to or don't have time the notification just disappear on it's on after like an hour maybe which has really helped with the guilt of not filling it in when I'm too depressed to even do that. Hope this helps! And just fire away with more questions if you got them, I've lived with this for 10 years and counting and don't mind giving advice when needed."

BipolarReddit,f4oag4o,t3_dl7f23,1571698582.0,"Hey, bp2 here as well. Don't beat yourself up for not recognizing it. It can be hard. I got diagnosed 10 years ago and I still can't see it coming every time. I get what you say about not perceiving time properly. It's exactly the same for me, I wake up one day and realize I've been depressed for a month or two. I think it has to do with how every day becomes the same. 

I study so for me it's usually get up, sit on the couch with anxiety, getting dressed and putting makeup over the dark circles under my eyes, go to a lecture for two hours, get home, sit on the couch with crippling anxiety, smoking weed to relax which helps, watching comfort shows on Netflix until SO gets home and cooks dinner for me otherwise I don't eat. Then rinse and repeat everyday of the week. 

What has actually helped me recognizing the signs are mood tracking apps. I use both daylio and Moodpath. Daylio to keep track of activities relating to mood and Moodpath for deeper reflection and sort of like a diary to get down the most pressing thoughts. I'm also lucky enough to have an amazing and supportive SO who I've lived with for five years. He's always on the lookout for signs of both hypomania and depression, we keep an open dialog about it. He's always frank with me and says stuff like ""you haven't eaten much recently or been very socially active, do you think you're becoming depressed?"" which helps me stop and reflect. 

Concerning life stress and depression, as you said, they go hand-in-hand. When something life changing happens, either good or bad, it can be a good idea to schedule a visit to therapist/pdoc to talk about how it can affect you. Like, my grandpa is really sick right now and I don't think he has much longer so I've booked more frequent and regular visits with my psychologist because I know it will plummet my already deep depression into a way scary place and I want to get ahead of that. 

Just remember, it's hard. You won't always notice. Sometimes it creeps up on you and you should never blame yourself for that. It's the disease, not you."

femalefashionadvice,f2b48x9,t3_dcbszn,1570121584.0,"I finally treated my self to a really good pair of black jeans from a company that also does free repairs for life. Best thing about it, they market all of their jeans styles to both men and women so each pair has actual pockets. I can comfortably fit my galaxy s7 in it's entirety. They also fit me like a glove! 

They're from the Swedish company Nudie jeans and you can find them here:

Also an honourable mention to my new second hand pair of really sleek and cute leather oxfords. Been craving oxfords for over a year but being a student I couldn't justify the splurge. Went to a second hand store and they just stood there, waiting for me and only cost me ~20$"

I'm a daily smoker and had to stop for a couple of months so I could pee clean and get my new meds, had horrible, extremely vivid and realistic nightmares for like a week and then just regular but still very vivid dreams for another 1-2 weeks. After that they lessened but I still remember dreams more clearly now than before."

I'm actually taking small steps in that direction with long sleeved shear black dress shirts with lots of ruffles and an amazing red lip as well as some long beautiful skirts that I can't ever wear because the weather's not right at all. But give me all the ankle length trailing layered voluminous skirts, beautifully cut capes, high collars, corsets and I wouldn't mind being even paler than I am today.
