PokemonTCG,fppofo0,t1_fppmax0,1588806068.0,"I agree big time. I feel like the big pull cards use to be the more badass Pokémon. Now it feels like everyone just wants the cute Pokémon to get all the attention. Which is super annoying. I mean sure, occasionally throw some out there, because I gather they are just listening to who seems to be fan favorites but, come on. Let's put the Pokémon that would actually dominate the stage, back on stage. Ya know?"
PokemonTCG,fppm1m1,t3_genz8a,1588804786.0,"Yea it's great when they are fully stocked, but I'm personally seeing too much S&S to get excited. Loved the base set, but Rebel Clash looks like trash to me. Not exactly the coolest Pokémon that received V/Vmaxx cards, but beyond that some of the card art looks rushed and incredibly uninspired. I was excited for a Dubwool V and full art card and that ended up being possibly the most bland of the set. Rillaboom Vmaxx is about the only card from this set that excites me. Which sucks. 


If there were some Hidden Fates or Eclipse on the shelves, I'd be all over it. Hoped you pulled something big though. Happy hunting. Stay safe, stay healthy."
whowouldwin,fpn0m66,t1_fpn058v,1588746708.0,"Ok so if Joe wins, theres your answer to this scenario. Joe Rogan, a pretty metal 52 year old man, bloodlusted and on hallucinogens defeats a freshly born chimp. That's our victory. 

Humans weapon without actual weapons in their hands are our minds. Our cerebral capabilities are suppose to help us steer clear from these altercations, because without a weapon in our hands, that out brains created, we are not a very dominate animal in terms of physicality. 

And I think the bloodlusted tag is making people over think what a human can do, but underappciate what that would look like in a wild primate. Biblical, ravenous, rage latent violence."
whowouldwin,fpmzunw,t1_fpmz1tn,1588746108.0,"What part is accurate? How does a man, especially the scenario that says a small boy with a clear mind, defeat a baboon or any primate for that matter? How does this look? 

I know humans are metal as fuck but I don't know if people's theories are way over hyping humans capabilities against actual wild animals in hand to hand combat, or tragically underestimating what a monkey can do. Even the tiniest of primates are nothing but insanely athletically fluent muscle. What are you going to do try an rear naked choke a chimp? Let's say by divine intervention you actually get to this position, then what happens? The chimp rolls or grabs your face and literally, not figuratively, but literally, tears it up like its a rubber mask."

I'm not trying to be insulting just, wrong. If the primate is blood lusted it's over. We are talking about a super saiyan human here. 10+x strength, vast proclivity for violence, low to the ground and fast. Joe Rogan once played with a baby chimp, and said he didn't want to hurt it while he was wrestling with it playfully. It scrambled from his grasp, got to his back and Joe says it clubbed him in the shoulder muscle and he claims the thing felt like wood. He said it was so hard or dense, and just playing, nearly knocked the wind out of him. A small boy with a clear mind is never...ever..ever besting a baboon.  

The baboon, another primate that is widely underestimated in terms of it's damage output, and possibly one of the LAST of the primate lineage that one would ever want to face bloodlusted."

TrueDetective,ffwbgrs,t1_ffw3mnu,1580293902.0,"I think it's unfair to say that Fukunaga is the reason season 1 was so brilliant. Pizzolatto was the writer and creator. Everything that fans loved about the interwoven details and the structure for the characters that Matt/Woody brought to Hart and Cohle all came from Nic's brain. 

Fukunaga is brilliant with a camera, yes, and the two paired well together. Keeping the same director all season long helped as well. Every piece of the Louisina landscape felt like a character because everything filtered through the same lense, in a cohesive vision. 

But, Pizzolatto also stated that he had been working, sculpting, revising, and living out this story in his head for 8-10 years. He knew he had something, and he chewed on it until he knew it was something special. HBO tried to recapture that magic in a year and a half turn around. With how bad and almost parody like, the second season was, HBO agreed to take time off and let Nic write. He came back with season 3. Nic is a brilliant writer. Especially when he's given the time to shape his writing and create something he wants, instead of something he's forced to, in short amount of time.
