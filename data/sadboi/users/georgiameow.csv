CPTSD,fncn72a,t3_g0ju1q,1586841171.0,"When I was diagnosed my therapist used the words 'high-functioning'.

I have a younger sibling I care for whose PTSD comes out in the typical symptoms, high fear and anxiety, her brain volume is on high when triggered so her trauma became validated quicker as you can see when she is being triggered. 

My symptoms are the opposite, very high depersonalization, derealisation, and disassociation, so my brains triggered to mute my surroundings rather than heighten them. Its harder to visually see my distress.

I think both are just as upsetting and neither is worse than the other, it's just our brains taught us different ways to cope with the situation as children.

 I was placed in a parental position as a  child, therefore this way of coping with trauma was more suitable, as my anxieties were very external and 'high-functional', my brain made the pathways of my symptoms. I was trying to protect myself and my younger siblings, so I turned off to fight.

Due to my sister not having the parental position, I think her brain coped in a different way, internal anxiety and made the pathways to the classic PTSD symptoms. She was in danger, her brain turned to flight."
