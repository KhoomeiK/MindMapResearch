Lay on your back and progressively ‚Äúflex‚Äù each muscle from your toes up to your head and release. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. 

Also‚Äî a great app I like is ‚ÄúInsight Timer‚Äù it has lots of free meditations, stories, and white noise.

Best of luck ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Anxietyhelp,fqvpoj0,t3_gkzh37,1589682387.0,"My advice would to carry water with you, wear loose fitting clothing, and have fans where you work if possible/near your bed/etc. Perhaps change out your sheets to be lightweight if you have thicker sheets. 

Also eat food that‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù like salads, fresh fruit, smoothies, etc. 

I‚Äôm sorry you are having this problem :( 
Does it make you feel claustrophobic or is it more of a sensory issue?"
Anxiety,fqug1nu,t3_gkttro,1589658347.0,"Yes, just a few months ago I went to the Urgent Care because of severe stabbing abdominal pain all over. They gave me a GI cocktail and it helped some. They checked blood work, did a urine sample, pregnancy test, etc. but everything came back normal. They said it was likely gastritis or stress. 

But abdominal issues were my first symptom of anxiety. Before I even had diagnosed GAD/Panic Disorder/Depression‚Äî abdominal symptoms were always around causing me to leave work early and such."

lexapro,fpxuzb9,t3_gg2ozn,1588990118.0,"I worked at a hospital as a patient observer, so I was there to monitor patients who may be suicidal, Have Alzheimer‚Äôs, or other conditions that prevent them from being safe alone.

I have had anxiety and depression since my early teen years and have generally been okay with working in a hospital, in fact I think it has made me more compassionate. 

But I remember there was a time I had a panic attack when helping a young girl after a suicide attempt. Nothing gory about it, it was just one of those things. 

I recommend taking it slow and making sure you have coping skills that can get you through those rough times."

Anxiety,foz4rpa,t3_gaarcc,1588184674.0,"I thought that there was something wrong with me internally or physically before I knew it was anxiety. 

I was nauseous, exhausted, jittery, emotional, and nearly fainting when I had what I now know were panic attacks.

When I went into the doctor to get myself checked out I realized I was having panic attacks and had severe anxiety. I thought that my thoughts and feelings were just part of being a teenager and was normal.

I thought that anxiety was all racing thoughts and hyperventilating. 

It‚Äôs hard when anxiety impacts you so physically because it can then be hard to utilize coping skills due to feeling so overwhelmed. 

Medication and therapy have definitely helped."

lexapro,fnhtr0f,t3_g1oy4t,1586968695.0,"I‚Äôve been on lexapro for about 2 years now. I started with 10 mg, went up to 15, and now am back at 10. I still have spinning anxious thoughts, irritability, etc. that come with general anxiety. However, I don‚Äôt have panic attacks anymore. My panic attacks were very physical (sweating, crying, nausea, feeling like I was going to faint, etc.). It took a bit for me to feel ‚Äúnormalish‚Äù, like a few months or so until the panic attacks stopped. 

I‚Äôd say give it some more time, and if no improvement, consult your doctor. 

Meds + therapy  + meeting basic needs = best combo"
