Gangstalking,fm3q18z,t1_fklh50a,1585732683.0,"Very excellent points made!  Thank you for being neutral and not allowing cognitive dissonance to sway your opinion.  This is in fact VERY MUCH REAL, and as aforementioned, there have been credible sources that have blown the whistle on their experiences with gangstalking, such as former FBI agent Ted Gunderson and Dr. John Hall.  Thousands of people globally, reporting eerily similar experiences aren’t having a collective hallucination or suffering from a collective psychosis.  To any genuinely targeted individuals reading this:  stay strong, protect your energy, document your experiences diligently and in multiple formats/locations, and do your best to spread awareness on this topic. Eventually, what is done in the dark will come to the light.  The only solace I have, is knowing that The Most High sees everything and these evil people doing this to us will one day have to answer for this.  

Take care,

It’s your job to make those without proper knowledge of awareness of this topic to automatically discredit those suffering through this awful experience.  This is illegal, unconstitutional, and unethical.  I can bet my life you’re a perp.  So former FBI agent Ted Gunderson and actively practicing doctor, Dr. John Hall are mentally ill too?  They’re making this up?  They were on drugs?  Didn’t think so.  I hope you suffer for eternity for participating in this."

However, I do believe that if we commit suicide, we are forced to reincarnate back onto this Earth to learn whatever lessons we bypassed by committing suicide.  Everyone was born for a reason and with a purpose, and until we fulfill our soul’s mission there’s no easy way out.  Just my two cents.

Perhaps not what mainstream religion tells us it is, but there is a loving creator.  While what genuine targeted individuals are going through is horrendous, one must know thyself and not lose faith as well.  Those complicit in gangstalking (which is illegal extrajudicial punishment) will have their day when they die and must answer for what they’ve done—participating in ruining people’s lives.

What is an “internet gang”?  That sounds absurd and you may possibly be a perp/troll trying to discredit TI’s by making outlandish baseless claims about “internet gangs”.  These forums as well as support groups are rife with trolls/perps who make commentary that makes authentic TI’s seem crazy or to discredit their claims.  While I’ll admit that SOME people claiming to be targeted may very well be suffering from acute mental illness, gang stalking IS IN FACT REAL as I’m a targeted individual myself.

BipolarReddit,f53i7z7,t3_dmkw8v,1571960077.0,"I’ve never personally had anxiety/panic attacks, psychosis, or depression induced by weed.  I largely attribute it to smoking only indica strains.

I do, however, feel like it’s best to abstain 100% but I prefer to smoke to help with my bipolar induced insomnia versus taking another pharmaceutical.
