Yes it‚Äòll still be ‚Äùsupported‚Äù, but you‚Äòll notice many games designed for current gen have issues running on previous gen, ie fps drops etc. Plus, the older gens continuing to be supported will always hold back new gen console. However if one has a comparable gaming PC, you‚Äôre only held back by the capability of the computer rather than both hardware capability & legacy support. Plus there‚Äôs more control, like if something runs poorly at high you can drop to medium. And instead of having to upgrade the entire unit in 3 years you need only upgrade the GPU.
