LarsVonTrier,f2u55f8,t1_f2ehpn0,1570407611.0,"I have watched this movie 3 times and I really stand firm with my perspective. He was just doing this movie as therapy. He was going through a REAL tough time. If you don't know, von Trier is very human, like all of us. He is sensitive. He is terrified of airplanes, he will not step foot on one. He has depression, anxiety...he admits that he drinks a lot to help his anxiety. I relate will all of those things as a human. He is a great artist in my opinion. It doesn't take a lot to kill a bunch of people ir abuse your family. It takes a lot to make it into art so you don't ever hurt anyone. Does that make sense at all?"
LarsVonTrier,f2g1pq3,t1_f2eh5mt,1570225518.0,Definitely. It was more of a therapy exercise for him than it was him trying to tell an unambiguous story. I feel like he was able to channel his sadness and depression into Charlotte Gainsbourg and I think that dynamic worked well for both of them. Gainsbourg is SO fearless in this movie. She really gets vulnerable and i really appreciate it. If there's one thing i love about his movies is the acting. Even the roles that aren't spot on like Stacy Martin in Nymph still somehow work.
LarsVonTrier,f2ebfdi,t1_f2ea1nt,1570189828.0,I like this interperetation
LarsVonTrier,f2e1lw3,t3_dd06vy,1570175277.0,"Yeah it's pretty fucking great. I enjoyed watching a von Trier movie that wasn't constantly making me cringe with violence and sex and all that. I loved watching Charlotte Gainsbourg smash Willem Dafoe's testicles and then jack him off until he cums blood in Antichrist, but the change of pace was definitely nice hahaha."
LarsVonTrier,f2d2tti,t1_f2b70d3,1570146185.0,HAHAHA pretty much. It was a horrible way to ruin a great character. But it seems to align with his outlook. There are no heroes in his stories. No one wins. If someone seems too good to be true then they are.
LarsVonTrier,f2ap9tc,t3_dcavns,1570116127.0,"I REALLY need to watch Breaking the Waves. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is possibly my favourite living actor. He's fucking brilliant. He was brilliant in Nymphomaniac too. The end was kind of divisive for me. I was in a really deep depression episode when i watched Nymphomaniac and I had an anxiety attack at the end. It was really scary for me because I liked Seligman so much. But when i analyzed it later after I separated my emotions from my analyzation i realized that it was really well executed and powerful. Especially for it to effect me like it did. I have a lot of respect for Gainsbourg, Skarsg√•rd, and von Trier. They have all known each other for a long time so the rape scene was probably not hard to film for them. I kind of went off on a tangent, sorry haha"
LarsVonTrier,f27y51c,t3_dcavns,1570048560.0,Let me know what you think. I LOVE Antichrist. Nymphomaniac was good but it was hard to watch. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. Same with Antichrist as well though.

It doesn't take much to tell when someone has a bunch of love in their heart or if they are full of shit. You can really feel Fred's burning love for humanity. I love it so much. Thanks for posting this. I haven't seen it in a long time and it made me cry like a fucking baby. So wonderful ‚ù§ thank you for this."
videos,etn4suu,t3_by2b3k,1562976736.0,"Did this get demonitized? I obviously hope not (fuck censorship 100%), but a Saberspark video recently got demonitized because he was talking about a Jimmy Neutron episode where Carl gets pregnant up his butt. So if this didn't then ill be shocked. Anyone have any info on this? I honestly thought the George Foreskin Grill video was amazing"
LarsVonTrier,erjkjrq,t1_erhdkwk,1560934524.0,"Yeah, i live in Phoenix, Arizona, US and I called my local record store hoping to find a cheap used copy of Antichrist, but all they had was a 16 or 17 dollar. Ew cooy of the criterion ( which I'm consideeing buying because of how much I love the film) I also am dying to find a copy of The House That Jack Built because of how much I love von Trier. Any help would be greatly appreciated"

horror,eosfm7e,t3_bszw2g,1558822437.0,"The House That Jack Built is a psycho killer movie. But it's hyperrealistic. The script is fantastic, the acting is out of this world, the settings and enviornment are absolutely consuming. The gore is very realistic. It's VERY dark and unforgiving. Hereditary is also good. Hereditary is a little more supernatural but not realistic like Jack."
horror,eosf61g,t3_bsxne2,1558822258.0,"I would have thought the ""newborn porn"" scene in A Serbian Film was going to be too much, and it was hard to watch, but it was so tasteless, over the top, and fucking absurd that it was easy for my brain to write off as ridiculous schlock. The whole movie was just so absurd that it wasn't even freaky."
horror,eoserzp,t1_eorlpid,1558822087.0,"The duckling scene is really hard to watch. I've seen it multiple times, and only after 3 or 4 times was I clearly able to tell that a fake leg was used. I actually had to Google it to make sure when i first saw it. But now I feel like i know Lars von Trier pretty well, and he would never hurt an animal for a movie. I think the scene where he shoots the kids is a little too hard to watch. I didn't like that scene much, but i understand von Trier and i think i understand the personal meaning for him behind that paricular scene."
horror,eoscabb,t3_bsso0k,1558820959.0,"I've seen all of 1 and some of the tapes from 2. The zombie tape and the cult tape were two of the creepiest, bad ass horror movie footage I've seen in a long time. I mean, it really was terrifying. I loved it. I was very surprised when i watched the first one that I really enjoyed it."
horror,eosa6dn,t3_bsyd8o,1558820017.0,Not at all. It's very aesthetically pleasing. Kubric was all about enviornment and setting when it came to this film
