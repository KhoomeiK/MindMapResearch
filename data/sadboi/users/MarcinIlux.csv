I actually respect the “I’m a virgin, but I’m not an incel” people, because they recognize the faults and grossness of the incel ideology. That despite you not believing in it, it very much exists. 

But regardless, I would like to see some sources on the idea that you’re not a cult. Maybe not a centralized cult, but the community follows most of the BITE model controls."
IdiotTears,foqgunp,t1_foqeqep,1587993253.0,"Yeah, exactly. :/ sadly as I see it, Inceldom is the kind of brainwashing that can really ruin a young person. I’m not sure what to do about them either, perpetrators of a garbage ideology."

He meows incessantly until I walk with him to the food plate and he just eats. He loves being pet while he eats."

Here it is if you want to take a look. Is truly eye opening and heartbreaking."
TheRightCantMeme,foe8b0p,t1_fodrjst,1587698075.0,"Listen, I get it. I don't want children either, and I hope I never become a parent.
But the word ""hate"" is a little much, and it is a sensitive subject as you may imagine. Discomfort, is not hate. Avoidance is not hate. 

But in the context of what the other person said, they compared them to spiders. And you know what you do with spiders? you kill them. Like pests. 
All I'm saying is that language like that can get insidious and hurtful, and while they will not literally kill a child, or a dog for that matter, it's still alarmingly strong language to voice discomfort."

AmItheAsshole,fodkfam,t3_g6ps43,1587685792.0,"NTA, excuse me? Children are not property, you don’t call dibs on them, and they’re not “off limits” like an ex partner. Her and sadly, the friends you mentioned, are appalling and horrible. I’m glad you blocked them, and I hope you now have a beautiful, peaceful family life."
