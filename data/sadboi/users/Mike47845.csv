Anyway here I am a 22yr old guy walking thru a 8 mile trail in the middle of Florida by the river. I saw a couple of alligators that day and they were pretty cool but what made me say fuck it and abandon the idea of walking this whole 8 mile trail. Was when I was about 4 miles in and I looked down about a foot in front of me and saw a decent sized Pygmy rattlesnake ( look it up for pics). I instantly just froze and just stared down at this thing. I will never forget the fear that came over me thinking that I‚Äôm all the way out in these woods without any help close by if I get bit. I ended up grabbing a stick and hitting the ground with it to get the snake to slither away. The whole situation felt like I was frozen in time just staring at this thing so close to me. But in reality this ordeal was over in like a minute. Still one of the most scariest moments in my life dealing with a animal.
