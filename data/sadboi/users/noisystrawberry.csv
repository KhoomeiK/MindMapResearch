I want to tell you that you can't blame yourself for the way you're currently feeling. You're the one who is suffering here, no need to add guilt to the mix. The way you currently feel about your children, you not wanting to do fun things with them and not wanting to be a mom, this is just a reflection of your mental illness. That's not really you, you have to remember that. You love your children just as much as any mother does, but the demons in your head aren't allowing you to enjoy their childhood as much as mothers do, cause everything feels like it's so exhausting, and you feel you don't have the energy. But you NEED to know that you are probably more needed now than ever, you have two very small children who desperately need their mother ALIVE. You can't let the illness take you from them. Suicide is a no go. People in your life need you. Have you ever tried medication? Might be necessary if you're clinically depressed. I'm sending you lots of hugs, OP."
