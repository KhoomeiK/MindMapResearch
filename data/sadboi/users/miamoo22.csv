Anxiety,fme6skx,t1_fmdk63m,1585991779.0,I found propanalol really helped with blushing. It’s definitely worth asking your gp about.
Coronavirus,fgw4u3d,t3_f0kqn8,1581156756.0,"I dont get why they're only taking the infected passengers off, surely they should just assume that whoever they are sharing a cabin with is more likely to be infected and take them off the ship into quarantine.  Then after the 14 days everyone has been isolated from each other and everyone that isnt infected can leave the ship."
conspiracy,fgf7nru,t3_ey24j8,1580728808.0,"This is really interesting. I read an article that the consequences of China having the 1 child policy, has left them with a really skewed population of too many men."
Anxiety,fgf5sjc,t1_fgbd99i,1580726005.0,"You're definitely not alone, and yes things are going ok at the moment considering! I dont know if you notice a pattern that you have periods when you're jumpy, and then it reduces for a while, then comes back, I do find that. When I start getting jumpy I think ok what am I doing (or not doing) to be kind to myself. Am I making an effort to message friends or meet up, am I eating properly, drinking enough fluids, have I taken my meds, my vitamins, am I worrying about something -if I am I'll write about it in the notes on my phone-can I do anything about it-get advice off anyone-etc.

I'm not saying any of the things I do will help, I dont know if anything helps, but I dont feel as helpless. I take it as my body giving me a sign that I'm overhwelmed, this sounds stupid but instead of being angry at myself for being a weak person, which is what I was doing before, I thank myself for the warning sign (see its stupid lol) and then go through the things above."
Anxiety,fg7l5e6,t1_fg7j45u,1580595175.0,"You wont get mugged or mudered with an alsation, I used to have a Doberman and people used to cross the street lol You could walk with your husband, for a few weeks and then once you get used to it go a bit earlier. It takes a long time to get back to 'going out without it feeling scary', but honestly if I can do it anyone can."
Anxiety,fg7knd0,t3_exbio1,1580594823.0,"Its not bad, its really good actually. Not only is it good, its a very brave thing to do, to admit hey I'm struggling here, and to not isolate yourself."
Anxiety,fg7k7i4,t3_exbod8,1580594515.0,"The first symptoms are a dry cough and a fever, if you dont get a fever then you definitely dont have it. To keep things in perspective when I start to panic, I think to myself, that there were 2 plane loads of people from the US and also the UK that were brought back from the centre of Wuhan, they lived there as normal, totally unaware while the outbreak was ongoing and not a single one is infected with the virus. So it isnt very easy to catch or they would all have it."
Anxiety,fg7jndw,t3_ex7gxp,1580594128.0,"The thing thats helped me the most is hypnosis (other than medication). I listen to the free ones online mostly but I also borrow cd's from the library and get some off audible. I started listening to them to help me sleep, and when that really helped I got a range of different subjects, anxiety, confidence etc"
Anxiety,fg7jahz,t3_exa6k3,1580593881.0,"I used to suffer from this terribly. I went to see the GP and got some medication that really helped and I'd say my blushing is now at a normal level, so definitely talk to your doctor. There are also relaxation recordings online using hypnosis that help with this, I've never done a blushing one, but I did a mouth biting one and it worked first time!"
Anxiety,fg7ikpy,t3_ex85xg,1580593388.0,"Yes!! I was only saying to my boyfriend I'm so jumpy just recently. It's such an over the top startle response. the neighbours closed a door and I jumped out of my skin, a floor board creaked, I jumped, it happens about 10 times a day"
Anxiety,fg7hya8,t3_ex97kj,1580592954.0,"I've struggled with this really badly. I saw my GP and he gave me some medication but what I also did was I started going out at night when it was quiet and I wouldn't bump into many people, I did find that easier. Then once you get the hang of it, and it feels more comfortable go a bit earlier if you can manage that. If you can find someone to walk with you at first then thats great, it really helps as it might distract you. I couldn't even go out into my front garden to put out the bins, and now I can go to my local town during the day on my own! I never thought I'd ever be able to do that."
Anxiety,fg6wuw9,t1_fg6vjax,1580578739.0,"That’s good, so you managed the routine side of it ok. You could always give it a try, ask them for a trial period and just see how you find it. It might take the pressure off you if you think it’s only going to be a week or 2 weeks and see how it goes from there?"
Anxiety,fg6ekd8,t3_ex4u7w,1580565661.0,"I find replying to posts hard. I have ADHD/anxiety/depression and suspected autism. Depending on how I'm feeling on any particular day I either write too much, I cant keep to a point, I find my replies come across as harsh and bossy compared to many others that are full of empathy or I write posts out and delete them because I think what I say has no value. I'm going to try and get involved more though"
Anxiety,fg6e14d,t3_ex4u1h,1580565175.0,"Well from what you've written you know that you can do the actual work involved, and I'll be honest it sounds like a perfect first proper job, you're worried about 'having' to turn up every day. Is there anything else you do/did regularly that you managed? school, college, a club? If yes then how did that go?"
Anxiety,fg6def5,t3_ex5woz,1580564571.0,"I can relate to this so much. I find it affects me even if the person isn't angry with me. If I'm in a situation where someone raises their voice at me, I let them speak a bit then say 'you seem really angry' and I'd say 50% of the time the person realises that they were raising their voice, and it calms them slightly. Do you ever get outwardly angry yourself?"
Anxiety,fg6cpkq,t3_ewyhxf,1580563879.0,"Do you think it might be because you never ask him a question. You said you barely speak to him, and never ask him anything. Maybe he's noticed that, and he's noticed you make a point of asking someone else, he could be feeling a bit left out, or wondering why you dont ask him. I'd try and ask a bit less if you can, but I would make an effort to ask him a question every now and again. I know it will feel really awkward now, but just try and see what happens. 

Asking questions is definitely a good thing though generally, you should never feel afraid of asking if you're not sure."
Anxiety,fg68me9,t3_eupik4,1580559122.0,"I’m in the UK and public health England are causing so much unnecessary worry and anxiety. They’re saying now that the 2 family members that are infected, one of them is a student at York uni, but not even saying if they’re male or female, not saying which classes they took, but then saying come forward if you may have been in close contact with them, which means within 2 metres for 15+ mins. How on earth are you meant to know! There giving such vague information out in such small amounts to try and stop panic but can’t they see it’s having the opposite effect."

Anxiety,ffwejkv,t3_eviowh,1580297973.0,"I know what you mean, I feel scared of what's going on in the world at the moment. Its one thing after another isnt it,  I've found that listening to a hypnosis sleep recording helps me relax and fall asleep, it just takes my mind off everything. But my anxiety is also really high, I'm struggling to keep things in perspective."
Anxiety,fbycd0i,t3_ef3vhg,1577213365.0,"I don't usually reply to posts, well I sometimes start writing, but then read it and think I sound stupid, no one will want to read my reply, so delete it, but I just had to reply to you. You did so well, I went out today too, nothing as big as yours. I just went to an appointment but I did it. I hadn't even thought about it as an achievement until I read your post! Hope you have a good day too"
Anxiety,f9jgz8y,t3_e59a70,1575373897.0,"Oh wow I thought this was just me! I do this too, I bite the inside of my mouth I don’t even realise I’m doing it most of the time. I found a hypnosis recording online to stop mouth biting and the first time I listened to it I just stopped! Honestly! it was amazing, I completely stopped for a month, but then I had a really stressful incident happen and I started the biting again. So I listened again and it wasn’t quite as successful as the first time, I would say it reduced the biting about 90%. I keep meaning to listen again but I never find the time."
therapy,f12c702,t3_d74sl2,1569138127.0,"I usually write notes on my phone straight after every session, how I feel at that moment. Sad, angry, anything I said I wished I hadn’t or anything I felt I hadn’t explained properly. Anything I wanted to say but couldn’t. 
Anything I learnt about myself during the session good or bad. 
During the week if anything pops into my mind I’ll add that to my notes. 
The following week I spend about 1/3 the time talking about my notes from the previous week, 1/3 talking about day to day life and things that have annoyed or upset me and 1/3 talking about my dreams. It varies, I might not have a dream one week, but generally I would say this is what we talk about. 
Occasionally I have sessions where I feel I have nothing to say, it’s a struggle to keep it going which is also relevant, that goes in my notes to tell him the following week. Sometimes it’s because I’m angry with him for a comment he made, from weeks before, that I’m either not aware upset me, or I’m only partly aware. 
If I don’t dream it’s usually because he’s upset me or made me angry, he likes hearing my dreams so it’s a kind of punishment. I’m with holding them. 
Sometimes I won’t write the notes, which is also relevant so I tell him that as well. That also means he’s made me angry, or I felt abandoned or our connection feels lost. 
I don’t know if this is a good way or a bad way of doing it, but it pushes me to say things to him I wouldn’t usually bring up with people. I couldn’t possible say things at the time, as I’m either emotionally overwhelmed or just unaware consciously that I’ve been affected."
therapy,f0rbqs5,t1_f0qkiiu,1568879332.0,"Its so weird because logically once the emotions have died down, I can see that it wasn't intentional and that I've cancelled on people with no ulterior motive, so I know that there is another explanation. But in that moment my feelings are so overwhelming it takes all my will power to not call or message them asking if they like me. Its so weird for me to feel like this, as previously I would always feel hatred towards them, I dont need you anyway.  

Thanks for the reply, it really helps to talk about it."
therapy,f0ra8vp,t1_f0p7sqv,1568878115.0,"Thanks for the reply, yes I'll definitely talk about it when he comes back. The diary is a good idea, I'll do that too. Its so hard to not supress it as its all I've ever done. But I'll try"
Dreams,ewzvv8p,t1_ewzfn8j,1565901431.0,"Wow that’s a fascinating perspective thank you very much for that, has definitely given me something to think about."
TalkTherapy,epx00y2,t1_epwn8e6,1559588802.0,"Yes I do have childhood trauma, and I dont know if he specialises in that to be honest, I dont know what he has experience of or anything, the mental health care in the UK is so poor at the moment, that you get what you're given. I asked for a female therapist, and after 16months was given a male and told I would have to continue waiting if I didnt accept. I was in such a state at that point I just needed some help."
TalkTherapy,epwgxib,t1_epw6udo,1559575561.0,"Just to add after re-reading your reply. I am assuming that this is the most trust I could have in a therapist,  but I can’t say that for sure as he’s the only therapist I’ve had."
TalkTherapy,epwgdlc,t1_epw6udo,1559575162.0,"Thanks for the reply it’s really appreciated, sorry you’ve been through the same thing, it really is awful. I really appreciate your opinion, sometimes it feels like ‘they know best’ but sometimes they actually don’t. 

The trust part, I think I had as much trust in him as I’m ever going to get in a therapist, but he seems to misjudge my reactions or make wrong assumptions alot. I’ve just got this constant feeling that he doesn’t ‘get’ me. 
For example a few weeks ago I told him of a family disagreement, about me not contributing much to the home, he asked what I did during the day, and said  ‘obviously you don’t just sit on the sofa all day’. I felt so hurt and misunderstood because that is what I do somedays. In that moment I said ‘no of course I don’t etc’. But the following week I told him his assumption was totally wrong, and I felt judged by him, and we did manage to sort that occasion out. There were other instances earlier in therapy that I didn’t feel able to bring up, but I feel able now. 
If I’m honest I feel like he’s out of his depth. 
I’m definitely going to go to the next session, I need to tell him how I feel and then decide where to go from here. 
The problem is on the NHS I will probably have a huge wait if I change therapists now, that’s if they even let me change (it took 16 months to get this therapy)."
