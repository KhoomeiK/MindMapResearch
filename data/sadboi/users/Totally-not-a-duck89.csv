The CGM helped a lot, but what really helped the curls come back was to add the juice of half a lemon with the amount of hair moisturizer treatment that I was using that day.

I'm sorry for the products not being in english, they are br and they are all free from: 
Sulfates 
Parafin 
Petrolatum 
Parabens 
Mineral oil 
Silicones  

And maybe some other stuff, so if you can get your hands on these products, I highly recommend for 2abc hair types"

When I am depressed it happens way less than when I am on mania (like 3 to 5 times, so little that now that I am not tracking, I can barely remember), I usually hallucinate about 15 times a month and they are very quick visual hallucinations. When I am maniac it REALLY shows.

Like, my mania lasts for about a week or two, and I can hallucinate up to 30 times during only a week (I used to track them before but don't do it now). I think I might talk with my doctor about it, tho they don't bother me anymore, I am starting to think something might be happening here"

I recently have started coloring my pieces (I used to only work with india ink and hatching), so I feel like I am having a bit of a hard time working with hues. I feel like the skin of the character is a bit too olive/golden toned for her (it's a self portrait and I have neutral/pink undertones). I tried to fix it (only changed her right arm) but idk if it looks better, if it needs deeper shadows or if it needs more blending. The left arm is not finished and I am gonna erase it, so please ignore that situation xD

truechildfree,fah9wdh,t3_e91ycp,1576082189.0,"Thanks everyone! It calmed me down a lot! First time I was putting it when I was not fertile, without dilation meds, not on my period and without sedation or ibuprofen beforehand. It hurt me a lot, to the point where I cramped and bled for a week, despite not being able to have it inserted. 

I was super scared it had gone wrong, but the pain now subsided and it's a lot more bearable now! I can see I will not regret this contraception method!"
TransDIY,fadc42b,t1_fadbh0m,1575963872.0,"The problem with neutral language in portuguese is that ""the"" in phrases is also gendered, and so are adjectives. So a normal phrase like ""o meu amigo √© bonito"" (my friend is handsome) gets changes to ""le meu amigue √© bonite"" which is pretty hard to those older folk or those that are not used to it. So I feel kinda obligated to settle on male or female pronouns so I don't have to teach this to every stranger I pass by. Which I lucky am ok with girl, because I feel like I could pass as a tomboy and not get much shit for it. But I feel like I could ask my trans friends to try to use the neutral language with me to try it out!"
