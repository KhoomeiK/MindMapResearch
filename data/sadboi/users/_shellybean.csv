When it comes to meat, chicken and fish are much better than red meats. The way I found this out was by doing Weight Watcher's, the reason everyone says diet fads (Weight Watcher's, for example) don't work is because after they're done their subscription to the diet, and lost their desired weight, they stop following what they were taught by the diet. I lost 25lbs on Weight Watcher's, but after I was done I went right back to how I was eating before, which is why I gained my weight back, because I stopped doing what I was taught.

The major thing that helps lose weight is **portion control** like if you're having rice to only have half a cup, as opposed to a full cup or more. Look at a box of mac and cheese or a bag of chips, it has a suggested portion on it, eat that suggested portion, as opposed to the whole box or half a bag. Instead of having potatoes as a side, have rice or veggies, instead of using sauces or condiments, use herbs and spices. If you want to use condiments or sauces, again, look at the suggested portions.

Paleo and keto aren't as good for you as people say, and going into ketosis is highly addictive, if you were to do keto it's actually suggested you don't do it for more than 3 months, because it's not good for you long term. Yes, have less carbs and sugar, but it also says to cut out good carbs and sugars, like fruits. Intermittent fasting is very hard on the body and hard to keep up if you don't work consistent hours, it's nearly impossible if you don't have set hours at work, like working a basic 9:00-5:00.

Your parents are very much TA's because they're giving him special treatment, even though he's no longer a child and doesn't need it, what he needs is to be held accountable for his actions.

My older brother is the one with Asperger's, I feel for him in a lot of ways because he has a much harder time socially and has no friends. I know from when he did have friends and partners that he treated them very well, but for the majority of my life he was abusive, angry and unreasonable, his anger issues still pop up every now and then, but overall he's changed quite a big in the last few years. He's about to turn 26 and my parents still treat him like he's 10 and give special treatment, they always make excuses for his behaviour (except my mom is the one that actually acknowledges the abuse, my dad does not and makes excuses for him). I know from so many experiences how frustrating it can be, I know when they're adolescents that they do need more help, but they get help so they can adapt to the neuro-typical world, so they should no longer be coddled beyond a certain age, unless their Asperger's is low functioning. I'm the only one who tells it like it is with my brother, him and my parents don't appreciate it, but he needs to be made aware of these things, or he'll never make a conscious effort to make a change. Your parents need to take responsibility and realize he's not a child anymore, in my opinion, you did the right thing here, kudos to you."
relationship_advice,fp69ftf,t3_fx5z2m,1588348454.0,"INFO: What chronic illness does she have? Because most chronic illnesses are disabilities and you can't really expect someone with a disability to contribute as much as you do because they're **disabled**.

Listen, I have a friend with multiple health problems, they've got EDS, POTS, Lyme disease, chronic fatigue and endometriosis, their life is hell, they can't even walk three blocks without passing out. Their partner has to pick up the slack because my friend is literally incapable of doing as much as he does, you need to have more compassion for what your girlfriend is going through, if she was capable of doing more then she would, she probably feels really shitty that she can't do as much as you do. The thing about being in a relationship and living with a partner that's disabled/chronically ill, is that you become their caregiver, which can be exhausting, it's called Caregiver Burnout and it's valid, it just means you need some time to be alone and relax for awhile so you can regain your own energy to be able to help your loved one again, even if that means doing the cleaning and cooking they can't do.

It's not like your girlfriend isn't trying, it's that she's actually incapable of doing certain things, stuff that's easy for you is extremely hard for her. With chronic illness it's really hard to find a doctor that will help with proper treatment and take them seriously, it's also really hard for someone to come to terms with the fact that they actually need a lot of help and aren't able to do the same things as other people. Chronic illness is debilitating, it's really hard on the body and it can greatly affect mental health, it often leads to depression and anxiety, which just adds even more to what they're already going through."

We didn't have sex for two weeks, which was already bothering me and causing more insecurities, then I found out he had masturbated during that time and I was devastated, I bawled my eyes out and called a friend because I thought something was wrong with me. Well, I talked to my boyfriend, he admitted to masturbating but it was because he wanted it to be a quick thing, just release the tension in a minute, as opposed to having sex when he's not feeling like it. Part of my brain is still telling me that it's my fault and if he really loved me and found me attractive he'd have sex with me, but those thoughts don't add up, he's constantly telling me I'm beautiful, sexy, cute, pretty, gorgeous, hot, literally any flattering compliment a partner could say about your appearance, **and** he still plays with my butt and bust, literally whenever he see's them he is all up in my business. Because of these thought patterns not adding up with actual actions he's exhibiting, and feelings and thoughts he's expressed, I'm trying to remind myself that *it's not my fault*. He loves me, he finds me attractive and he does enjoy our sex life, he's just not always down to have sex like I am, but that could be an age thing, because I'm 23 and he's 28, so his sex drive isn't the same as it was when we started seeing each other 2.5 years ago.

Communication is one of the most important things partner's need to have in order to have a healthy and thriving relationship, we need to discuss these issues with our partners and get to the bottom of it, so we don't internalize it and develop insecurities and resentment.

Hold on to him, this is a good sign, hold him tight and remember to never let a day go by without expressing your love, don't ever let each other have a single second to doubt the other will leave or stop loving them. My grandparents were together for 60 years, when I was a kid my grandfather told me the secret to a healthy and loving relationship was to never go to bed angry, no matter how upset you are with each other always remind him you love him and don't go to bed with any resentment.

Now, about therapy: I know how hard it is to seek help, I know it's hard to believe anything will help you, but give it a shot, it takes more than just 5 sessions, you need to constantly go in in order to see improvement. I was the same as you, suicidal as hell and didn't think things would ever change, didn't think anything would help, but everyone made me realize that I needed to make a change. A diagnosis to understand why my brain works the way it does, therapy to cope and get to the root of the problems, and medication to help my brain function all changed me for the better. I'm a completely different person than I was and it's because of me getting hospitalized and starting a program that made me realize that this wasn't living, it was barely hanging on while I was just existing. I know you don't believe in therapy, but what does it hurt to try? It's worth a shot, tell them how you're feeling, what you think about, **everything**, they ask the questions that need to be asked and you need to be 100% honest. Like I said, it won't be instant, but give it a few sessions and keep an open mind, they are safe and impartial, you are the only thing that matters in those sessions and they are trained to help better your life.

I have been through the process and after all this time I have the life I never thought I would. I'm living now, I've surrounded myself with people who support me, I have a therapist that's changed my life and is one of the reasons I'm here today, I sought help even though I thought I was broken and nothing would change, but things did, it took a lot of work but I'm finally content with my life.

I hope one day things change, I am so glad you are still here and I hope you find people in your life who will be there for you."

relationships,fotbnq3,t3_g9gd0e,1588049395.0,"Try Feliway! It's to help cats stop scratching and urinating/marking territory wherever they want. You can either get a spray for specific spots, or there's one you can plug into the wall and it covers the entire room.

""Feliway is a product that mimics a chemical that cats emit through the glands on their faces when they are feeling calm and want to communicate that to other cats in the area. This pheromone works on cats' brains to calm them down and help relieve stress and anxiety.""

Also, cat's puke when they puke, sometimes it's four times a month, sometimes none at all. From what you've said, it seems like he has an issue with food, which means he might be eating too much too fast, so he ends up puking as a result.

He might be peeing on your stuff to mark his territory, as in ""she's mine, no one go near her."" I had a cat who was ~perfect~, then our other cat came to live with us again and he completely changed, he started peeing on our clothes and beds so the other cat wouldn't go near our stuff/where we usually are. Basically, he was trying to keep her out of the bedrooms, and away from us individually by peeing on our clothes.

The fact that he only bothers you in the middle of the night means he probably likes you, if a cat doesn't like you they'll ignore you or be aggressive with you constantly. Is he swatting at your face and purposely clawing at it? Or is he attempting to make biscuits, but just on your face as opposed to your lap or stomach? If it's the first one, cat's a dick, if it's the second, then that means he likes you, he just doesn't show it the way a cat usually would.

Now, on to the food and waking you up to get some; Ignore him, he should be on a feeding schedule. He has to learn that he is not the alpha and you will not be giving rewards for acting out, he's doing it to get what he wants, don't give it to him. Either get him a timed feeder, or change his feeding schedule to at night, rather than the morning. Depending on his weight, it should either be a little over a cup or a little under a cup once a day, or you could give him half at say 9:00AM and then the other half at 9:00PM

I do stress getting Feliway, it changed my life, my cat used to go for the carpet all the time, now she just pick at it once and looks at us as if to say ""pay attention to me"" but we just raise our voice, or take her out of the room as a way to teach her that's wrong and won't have the affect she wants.

Hope this helps! I've had cats my whole life and I promise that 99% of cats are sweet little beans."
