SFSU,fqvn8k8,t3_gl3omr,1589680859.0,Maybe it was already allocated for something else. Or its for when there are cuts to the budget.  Normally funds are already allocated ahead of time for upcoming projects and cannot be used for anything else. Ever so often the state has surplus and sometimes deficit.

The psychiatrist doubled the Strattera dosage and I dont feel any improvement. He claims I should try it for a month."

CSUS,f1d80ea,t1_f1d33ap,1569376299.0,Yeah that tend to happen when you are ADHD. I have been on modafinil before. I think it helped me because things were so bad once that I couldn’t even count backwards with ease. My blood pressure was high today and the psychiatrist didn’t want to prescribe any stimuli until it back to normal. He prescribed Strattera (Atomoxetine). It might take longer to get into my system. I want to go back on modafinil and try vyvanse with it.
CSUS,f19adnp,t1_f18hdgs,1569269895.0,Congratulations! And thanks for commenting. I loved what you had to say. Its very valuable. How much was the high dosage? I used to be on adderall and it made very overwhelmed to the point where I just wanted to lay down curled up.

Thank goodness for modern medicine and that I went to the hospital within 72 hours so they could give medication to prevent me from catching any STD, STI just in case he had it. I don’t like the fuck that I was raped but ever since it happened I feel like fucking with him again or feel like I want a latino guy."
