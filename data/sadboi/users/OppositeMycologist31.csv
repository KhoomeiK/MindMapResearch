ptsd,fptunyq,t3_gfehad,1588898615.0,I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I have trouble eating too in certain times when I am panicky or upset. I haven’t been able to eat much today. Its mainly nothing sounds even remotely good and I can’t force myself to eat. I usually feel like this after a breakup and feel emotional pain in my stomach and just can’t eat. The longest was 3 days (ate on 3rd day when I started to pass out). It took months for my appetite to come back and i still have a screwed up relationship with food. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Just telling my story so you know you’re not alone. Getting my panicking under control helps make me have an appetite again but it takes me a long time to do so. It’s scary for sure. I’m so sorry your mother died and I know Mother’s Day coming up may be difficult for you. I’m sorry.

I believe it was worded something like “to keep the therapeutic relationship in one channel”. I thought it was a great idea to make that expectation clear up front. I am a pretty private person and don’t have social media but I am sure a lot of people would want to “follow” someone they admire or trust."

Frugal,ey1mfha,t3_cuw2dj,1566703766.0,"Yeah, Bully sticks are quite expensive. That price is the cheapest I’ve seen them, so since OP mentioned bully sticks i threw it out there. 

Usually they are $8-$10 for just a couple pieces/sticks that weigh much less than 1lb. Low-odor bully sticks usually cost more than regular. 

Antlers are more long lasting. Also, if you have split antlers and your dog gets tired of them, you can boil them in a pot of broth to add a meaty taste."
Frugal,exzkyi9,t3_cuw2dj,1566667798.0,TJ Maxx often has these things for cheaper than pet stores. Last time I was there i saw 16oz of Bully Sticks for $12.99. I’ve also purchased 16oz gullet bites there for $7.99. They have antlers too. You could also check at a farmer’s market or meat processor for antlers.
