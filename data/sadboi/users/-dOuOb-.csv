He saw stained glass splintered by stones cast at holy places, 

Leaving a scuffed rearranged mosaic of ignorant faces.

He remembered a stark cast of bones dethroned by homophones,

Sparks echoing schism upon cobbles whispering wobbled tones, 

Drum beats on a bass line for a parched backwards march, 

Pikes falling on the whet ground black as aces arched.

Hands in prayer moving pieces of self into hidden shelves,

Out pacing tongues singing spells in colors no eyes can delve,

What the blind felt displaced now casts for tastes in lifes art, 

Trades for graves dug in hindsight to bury the minds heart."

We had an amazing night, nearly got arrested by mounted police for 8 of us being in the tray of a ute going through kfc drive through. Anyways at this point in the night i was more drunk than ive been in a very long time. I grabbed the kfc that was mine and stumbled back towards the hostel  was staying at. Ever since leaving the bar i needed to pee and it was all i could think about. I got into the hostel and walked to the toilet and as soon as i entered the room and saw the urinal i started to pee full stream. I got to the urinal and realised i was pissing my pants and struggled with my button and belt to finally pull my dick out. After that i crept very quietly though the hostel to my room which had no other occupants when i left in the morning but now had someone on the opposite bunk. I Stealthly slid out of my piss stained pants and thought about where i could buy a new outfit for the plane the next day until i fell asleep. 

So yeah nothing super impressive, just drank more than i could handle (as ive not drunk properly in years) and pissed my pants."
