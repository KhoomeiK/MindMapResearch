ADHD,fdnbv5f,t1_fdk0ury,1578582431.0,"I have no idea lol. I like how you explain it. It's like whatever comes to mind first gets out. Even if it's the complete opposite of what I believe. Since I thought someone could have this opinion, that's the one I say I have by default lol"
ADHD,fdm8has,t1_fdkehwo,1578542410.0,But kinda relaxing to go me cause I just let everything go. I don't have to think about anything. I don't have to focus. The thoughts just come to me and I don't have to do anything with them. I just let them go.

ADHD,fdltm6p,t1_fdlbvng,1578532200.0,Omg that makes sense!
ADHD,fdk5ppe,t1_fdk0dks,1578496666.0,That makes üíØ% sense
ADHD,fdjyaxd,t1_fdjy7fv,1578491275.0,Yes! That too! It's so weird
ADHD,fdjy9zd,t1_fdjxtz8,1578491254.0,"Yeah, it's hard to change! For me, I'll say for example that I believe prisoners that committed terrible crimes should be executed. Then I'll be like... what?  I do NOT think that. Why did I say that with so much confidence?"
ADHD,fdjtkmn,t3_elqsqc,1578487012.0,I just forget to listen to names lol. It's like my brain doesn't think this information is useful so it's been 4 years I work at the same place and still know only 5-8 names in 90-100
ADHD,fdjteap,t3_elp2nq,1578486838.0,"I couldn't listen in class during all my classes. All I was able to do was write exactly what the professor was saying so I could try to study it later. It worked pretty well. Also, make friends with people. I'm not very social but I made some friends so I could ask at the end of the class ""so do we have homework?"" I thought I listened the whole class but I ALWAYS missed that info. No matter how hard I was trying to pay attention.

Edit: I was typing the whole class, not writing by hand. It's way faster"
ADHD,fdjt718,t1_fdi1973,1578486632.0,"I didn't think it was that common to do that! Like, if I don't have to focus to understand what the weird speeded voice is saying, I'll just fall asleep or stop listening"
ADHD,fdjsv9c,t1_fdj89l7,1578486294.0,I don't think about stuff in the shower. I just have a two way monologue that makes absolutely no sense. It's like the AI generated text from the office. That's why I started to count from one to 100 in the shower. I would just zone out and forget I exist.

BPD,f5f6p3n,t3_dnp492,1572178805.0,"Yeah but I think everyone has that to some level? Or maybe not? Alcohol makes people anxious. If I drink, the next day I‚Äôll be super anxious and won‚Äôt know why. It sucks"
BPD,f4uxdbc,t3_dlme75,1571832357.0,"Yeah, but it was worst when I was younger. I always described myself Like an empty shell that had to learn how to be human. I didn‚Äôt even know I was a lesbian, and I‚Äôm still not sure because I never feel sure about myself. I never understood who I was because I felt like I was no one. Just a reflection of others. Now I‚Äôm building on what I know of myself. But it‚Äôs really hard so I try to stop asking myself that question. I know that I want to be kind, nice, help others, not be angry all the time, stable, etc. So I focus on that. I used to switch ideas all the time. I would not even remember I said something completely opposite to what I was saying at the moment. It‚Äôs really weird"

AmItheAsshole,exd8m0i,t1_exbewwz,1566170061.0,Same here! But I‚Äôd be happy for the drama to be honest. But I don‚Äôt wanna get married so it‚Äôs not like I understand what mariage is about
