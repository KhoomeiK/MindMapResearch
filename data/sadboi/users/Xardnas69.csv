3. They simply don't care about tier lists, for one reason or another. Tier lists are constantly changing because of patches and pro-players who main low tier characters, but absolutely destroy with them.

4. This obviously only applies for some characters, but maybe they mained that character in a previous smash game and just want to stick with that character.
