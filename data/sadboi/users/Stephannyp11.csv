transpassing,fp94cf3,t1_fp947mj,1588413844.0,You know what i do that doesn't require a lot of effort; at night (or whenever) after a shower braid your hair and overnight it creates lil waves. â˜º kinda low effort curls lol
transpassing,fp93y45,t1_fp92vop,1588413394.0,"Oh thought of something else, you could also try to add some waves to your hair, to give it volume, that usually softens any face :) 

soft makeup would do wonders i think!"
transpassing,fp935sn,t3_gb1qr5,1588412522.0,"Just personal preference, because you have nice eyes, id skip using liner on your lower lid. honestly you could totally skip the liner! Mascara is definitely enough to accentuate your features. 

You could add some volume to your hair too :D that usually softens any face up. Like layers or some product to thicken it 

Overall I think you pass already though!"
transpassing,fp92nbw,t3_gbpaze,1588411950.0,"I'd say either side sweep hair, or bangs, shape brows (they dont have to thinner just shaped imo) 

If it's your thing you could go for the no-makeup-makeup look. Like just use some mascara and maybe a pinkish (almost your natural color) lipstick :D"

BPD,f4ke4h9,t3_dktvds,1571648279.0,"I think its really good to just step away from a fight and really pick at what's the real reason you're upset. I live with someone with BPD and they are rather impulsive with their emotions instead of actually taking time to process WHY they're upset. Instead or just spouting vitriol. 

I can only say it from the perspective from the other side, but most arguments/fights are over things that just need a simple conversation. But they turn into something hateful and nasty, which just avoids the original topic and becomes a personal attack. 

(Im not saying you do this, but this is an example) 

I have to say of course the other party will make mistakes, and it can and will piss you off, but sometimes its best to let small stuff go. And if you feel too angry maybe just talk another time instead. I hope this is somewhat helpful!"
