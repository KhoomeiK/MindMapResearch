Anxiety,flfcaz7,t3_focqfa,1585103004.0,"I’ll tell you what someone told me last night. Even if you have it, in your age group, with the information we have, your odds of dying are .2%. I know that number still sounds scary (I’m not kidding) but consider this.

It’s .2% of known cases that are fatal. Now take into account some speculative things that all could work in your favor. There could be 10-100x the number of people infected than the number of confirmed cases. That would lower the fatal rate to .02-.002%. 

Now take into account the fact that, I believe it was in Italy they said 99% of deaths under 50 were those with preexisting conditions, which you said you don’t have.

Do you exercise? Regular exercise 5 days a week gives you twice the odds of surviving the flu than someone sedentary (based on a study done on mice). 

Your worst case odds at your age are 1:500. Taking into account the other factors your odds could literally be 1:500,000 of dying (they are probably less than this, but that’s the optimistic number). 

I know I’m talking in broad strokes but again, IF you have it, chances are it will suck. But you’ll pull through."
