The council had explained why reaching Anothys on a refugee shuttle was necessary. She remembered questioning the decision in front of them, in the hall of councillors. She kneeled on the stone floor beneath the dark metal thrones. Each throne was set on its own platform, the height of which indicated rank. They were all above her station; she had kept that thought lurking at the fringes of her awareness. The silence that had followed her question went on a full minute. When Eurus realised the council would not answer her question, she stood and left the hall, keeping her flushed face hidden in the loose fabric of her imperial hooded robe."

A rocket in deep space is always a good example - it will keep moving at the same speed unless a force is applied. 

On Earth, we have an atmosphere, so more often than not, air resistance provides a force in the /opposite/ direction to motion. So to keep an object in our atmosphere moving at the same speed we need to keep applying a force to cancel out this air resistance."
