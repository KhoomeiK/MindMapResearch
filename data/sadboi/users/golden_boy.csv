If you have a problem with words that behave this way, I'm sure that the English language in general is a nightmare to you.

Edit: Let me provide a similar example. Consider the word ""great"". I baked cookies, and my friend Susan said that they were great. Should I be bothered by this? ""Great"" means large or significant. My cookies were not large, and they were not important. Did Susan forget about the phrase ""very good"", or the word ""excellent""?

If she had used the word ""excellent"", should I have then been upset? That would imply the cookies themselves excel. The cookies do not excel. I excel at baking cookies.

Generally the total production and amount of land used by the leakage is substantially less than the amount offset by the regulation, but if the leakage occurs in the Amazon specifically (which it would for beef, Brazil is a huge supplier), then there's reason to suspect it could lead to a net loss of biodiversity and carbon sequestration.

Yes, anti-semitism can come from self-identified leftists and self-identified anti-racists. No, it's not as popular as the neo-nazi belief that the Jews are deliberately elevating marginalized groups to destroy white people somehow.

The notion that the Jews financed the slave trade specifically is a [common](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1992/2/12/jews-and-the-slave-trade-just/) myth [dating](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/slave-trade-black-muslim) [back](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1992/2/12/jews-and-the-slave-trade-just/) [decades](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1992/2/12/jews-and-the-slave-trade-just/). 

You may have misread the Wikipedia page. Take note of the use of the definite article ""the"" rather than an infinite article ""a"" or ""some"". The Black Hebrew Israelites believe they are ""the"" descendants, to the exclusion of actual Jews. And since I assume that you're engaging in good faith, I'll also assume that you bothered to read the Wikipedia article that you linked, so I assume I don't need to tell you that this view of theirs is not in any meaningful way contingent on your suggestion that an African Jew or two might have ended up stuck in the Atlantic slave trade. It's not really a plausible hypothesis anyway, because the large Jewish populations in Africa during that time period were in the northern and eastern parts of Africa. Furthermore, Ashkenazim come from central and eastern Europe.

We're looking at a guy affiliated with a cult, most of which constitutes a hate group, abusing antisemitic tropes, talking shit about the largest group of Jews by number, calling us Nazis (like the ones who put my grandmother's in Auschwitz).

I still felt like I was part of the tribe, it's not like the cultural aspects all go away if you decide to stop taking the stories as fundamentally true.

These days I identify as a pananthiest Jew with a materially athiest cosmology. As in, my view of the material universe is identical to that of an athiest. But if you consider that which encompasses and transcends all things real (like the universe) and conceptual (truth, beauty, justice, arithmetic, etc including those which the human brain is incapable of conceiving), that's a pretty good approximation of G-d that the rabbis talk about. So I put on my tefilin when I remember to, and I go to services with my mother when I visit her (I'm in a crappy town for grad school and the only full-service shul does gender-segregated seating at times which is a huge turn-off for me). I take a moment to silently, mentality give thanks on a near-daily basis. Because i think G-d as I see them is worth worshipping, and it's not really anyone's business if I'm conceptualizing G-d in the same way as everyone elss.

changemyview,fp23vff,t1_fp1wdz0,1588254605.0,"I'm sorry you're getting so many obfuscating replies. The truth is precisely straightforward.

The basic jist is that gender theory is a study of what society believes and how people. As in, masculinity and femininity aren't real measurable things, they're just ideas in people's heads, but they're extremely influential ideas in people's heads that dictates how people are treating in society, so we should figure out how it works so we can make things better.

That's the whole deal."

statistics,fox7k39,t3_ga2ud2,1588136045.0,"It depends strongly on what modeling choices you want to make. Do you want to estimate application rates, acceptance rates, and then enrollment rates conditionally on acceptance? Or do you just want to treat the data like a time series? What plausible correlation structures have you thought about?

In either case, if you don't have a background in statistical modeling, I advise *extreme* caution if you're thinking about making decisions informed by a statistics model. Without the training, you don't have the fundamental skills to properly interpret your model. The model maps assumptions to resultant outcomes, but without experience you're not well situated to understand the assumptions are implicit in your process. Having a model might make your beliefs about the future slightly more accurate, but your confidence in those beliefs will be *vastly* higher. You can easily find that you've confidently misled yourself."
