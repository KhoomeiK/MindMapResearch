We just started edging the outside perimeter with crestone blocks and since the front yard sits higher than the sidewalk the bricks are half buried in front, but, as you can see, the backsides are almost fully exposed. 

So, our plan is to fill the inside with river rock with assorted planters and hastas. Just didn‚Äôt know what type of edging would be best."
