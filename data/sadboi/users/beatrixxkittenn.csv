I‚Äôm an absolute mess. We live in a small shotgun house so there‚Äôs not much room for isolating. I just have all the windows opened now and praying I don‚Äôt catch it... absolutely terrified."
Anxiety,fprmhvz,t1_fpm459y,1588857644.0,This is helpful.. my boyfriend woke up this morning and said he feels sick. I am in full panic mode.
Anxiety,fo5ctnw,t1_fo4w3ia,1587522605.0,I appreciate that he cites everything. Definitely some good bits of information there.. It‚Äôs just also really important to remember that he‚Äôs going to compile a list of anything that supports his theory that ‚Äúthe man is out to control us‚Äù. I‚Äôd hate a good news group to get too wrapped up in this koo koo bird..

Anxiety,flbdi40,t1_flb0lyw,1585002408.0,I keep constantly hearing this like we‚Äôre waiting for a bomb to go off and the worst is still to come. But if we‚Äôre all staying home and keeping space why should we be made to think everyone around us is about to be sick and hospitalized? If the hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed right now and people are home and distancing why are we being told this is about to happen? Maybe I just don‚Äôt understand the numbers or I‚Äôm being naive.
Anxiety,fl8sl1i,t3_fj2y1a,1584931270.0,"Just an appreciation post. This pandemic triggered a relapse in my panic and anxiety disorder that I haven‚Äôt struggled with in years. I‚Äôm also a new mama trying to navigate what it is to be a parent. Your continued work to give everyone a place to find some hope in all this is invaluable. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to be able to handle this when the news started breaking.

Anxiety,fl865ai,t1_fl7yyr8,1584916682.0,"I think people have this idea that the virus is just covering everything and will magically end up in their house. It‚Äôs not. Do not stress yourself. Give all the surfaces and frequently touched things in your house a good wipe down or spray with Lysol if that helps you feel better.

Coronavirus is also respiratory. It‚Äôs very unlikely that swallowing a piece of food with the virus on it would get you sick."
Anxiety,fl7ce9j,t1_fl6w2gu,1584898855.0,I think about this a lot. I hate constantly being told we‚Äôre waiting for this bomb to go off. If we‚Äôve all started quarantining ourselves why should we still expect this crazy horrible overflow if it‚Äôs not happening now?

It wasn‚Äôt til late the second day that I had the first bouts of diarrhea with some light nausea here and there but that lasted all week long and it was ROUGH!

I had a fever til the afternoon of 2/26 and my cough turned productive. I went to the docs 2/27 just to get an all clear on my lungs because I was worried. This was right before the hysteria so coronavirus was never mentioned. She said a bunch of people were coming in with a respiratory virus that had some GI symptoms tagging along.

My boyfriend and another friend of mine were sick right after me with the same flu like illness and awful GI symptoms. Strongly suspect this was coronavirus."
Anxiety,fkr8xca,t3_fk6hmn,1584464124.0,I‚Äôm in New Orleans which is a hot spot right now. I was able to call my doctor and they sent in a prescription for Xanax when I have panic attacks.
Anxiety,fkoo7l2,t1_fklvo0v,1584391339.0,"I‚Äôm in New Orleans and we‚Äôre getting hit pretty hard down here post Mardi Gras. Thousands and thousands of tourists and locals crammed together for days on end. I got sick the last week of February. Started with a mild sore throat and dry chest feeling that turned into fever, aches, and chills with added diarrhea. Fever lasted 3 days or so. Productive cough followed the dry and now a couple weeks later I still have an occasional dry cough although the lingering could just be allergies. 

My boyfriend and another friend of mine got sick with the same symptoms soon after. 

I went to the docs on day 4 (before mass hysteria ensued) because I was worried about my lungs. She said she was seeing lots of patients come in with a respiratory virus with GI symptoms that wasn‚Äôt the flu. Never mentioned coronavirus once!

Pretty convinced that was corona spreading in NOLA."
