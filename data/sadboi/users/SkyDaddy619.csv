The number of top level villains can probably be counted on one hand. But heroes have a whole ranking system of top level. If most of that list got leveled right here by Shiggy, it would balance that and create more urgency for the rookie level heroes to mature, thus elevating the story. Lets not forget the story is being told by adult Deku as he reflects on his origin. Maybe this is the big tragedy that propels him and the other kids to the top, while also giving the surviving villains more meaning since they wouldnt (all) just be fodder anymore."
