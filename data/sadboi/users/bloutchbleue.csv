I don't think you are an asshole, but I kinda get why he is mad. 
To me (but maybe that's what you did, that's why I'm asking) the best way to handle it is talk to him about you concern, telling him you are that worried that you want to call a doctor. If he decides to listen to you and call a doctor then perfect, if not, tell him that's what you intend to do, even without his consent because you are scared and can't keep going with the fear he is gonna die. 
Communication in a relationship is the key. 
You did what you thought was the only option and for that you are not the asshole, your heart was in the good place. But imagine someone going behind your back, instead of talk to you, and give you the chance to make your own decision.

We still don't really know what's going on... There are multiple leads, the last one are he might have had two problems at the same time, one ""hiding"" the other. 
At the minute the vet thinks it might be an inflammation of the adrenal gland, causing a cystisis too (he is peeing orange and red these days) or a problem with his prostate...
So he has an antibiotic, anti inflammatory, anti spasmodic, panucar (he was in contact with e. Cuniculi too), and an anti acid. 
It's A LOT to take for him. 
But since the beginning of the week, due or not to the new treatment, he started moving again, not quite like before yet, to there are still really bad days, but for the first time I'm thinking he might get better... It is so tough to see him like that, but I have hope.

He took antiinflammatory and morphine for a while, just stopped today and im not seeing any difference. 
I call her pretty much every two days, she always says ""let's wait another two days"" but nothing changes. I'm describing every symptoms to be sure the vet has every carts in her hands to treat it as an emergency, but she doesn't react.
I just called her today saying I want you to see him again and she said ""I can, but it's weird, and I don't think I'll do anything, seems like a brain issue"".
