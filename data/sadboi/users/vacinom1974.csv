bipolar,f3v4v2w,t3_di5h7n,1571171588.0,Such good news. Latuda did it for me. What a difference wanting to stay out of bed!
bipolar,f3p8tan,t3_dhgfrt,1571050018.0,Mine were the color of oatmeal. Tossed those bad boys...didn't need any reminders!
bipolar,f396p3z,t3_dfx5mk,1570744331.0,"Wish we had more public exposure, don't you?"
bipolar,f37ak2x,t1_f36zu3x,1570723529.0,"I had no weight gain on Latuda thankfully, but 350 calories when taking it? Can't manage that and it still works fine. It was hard to start eating breakfast.  Good luck. It totally knocked out my depression."
bipolar,f2cppfl,t1_f2cju72,1570141081.0,I get being scared to go to the gym. I have a new y near by with an awesome pool but just can't get there alone. Sucks big time.
bipolar,f26koux,t3_dbs191,1570014827.0,Someone who speaks from the heart. We can all learn something from that. Really nice.
bipolar,f1za6f9,t3_daykwh,1569839843.0,Congrats on the great accomplishments. Hope all stays well. Makes me hopeful.

BipolarReddit,ey68fbh,t1_ey649q8,1566849768.0,I've been off it for two days now and the jaw trembling is almost gone. I looked at web and for reviews on latuda and there are more good than bad...might try that.
BipolarReddit,ey55y3v,t1_ey52mwa,1566822851.0,"So did I, but have you taken any others?"
bipolar,ey4xkel,t3_cuqtr1,1566813360.0,"What is up with the shower fear thing? I mean if I let myself I could really freak about it. It's like entering a bear cave, occupied. If I could get away with it I'd just wash my hair over the sink and do the wash cloth thing. Then when I do take one I feel like I deserve a medal. What a bizarre symptom!"
bipolar,ey2fl39,t3_cuxepj,1566737974.0,So uncomfortably true damn it.
bipolar,exe9wp9,t3_cs50qv,1566205682.0,HELL YES
bipolar,evv9g7j,t3_cl2dz7,1564826676.0,"Sooo true. My relationships last at most 4 months,  just long enough for me get sick about three months in and go through the I don't have any feelings for anyone stage. It sucks. Then I break it off. I don't even know if someone would have stayed. I'm lonely but it's too exhausting. I give up."
bipolar,ev56rmw,t3_ci3s78,1564228603.0,"I have bp and have attempted suicide several times. Glad to be here now medication compliant. I have a brother who is severely depressed and is letting his once beautiful home turn to shit. I understand his inability to move on it and keep it up. Also have a good friend who is in and out of the psyc ward every few months because she would like nothing more than to not exist when the pain is so excruciating you can't fathom it. These posts have taught me to shut up and listen. Just be there. But then there's always the chance that their situations might trigger me so sometimes I just have to back off and be unavailable. Makes me seem undependable and fickle, but they understand. Gives credence to the phrase 'takes one to know one'."
bipolar,euaf92g,t3_cfg9pj,1563615443.0,Have a cup of coffee and there's breakfast.
bipolar,eu9f79q,t1_eu8roh7,1563578972.0,United we stand!
bipolar,etwml0k,t3_cdis8c,1563277306.0,I think yearning for understanding and empathy are reasons for over sharing.  But unless you have this extremely dreadful disease there is no way to even come close to realizing what it's like.
bipolar,etn5fvs,t3_ccf5y3,1562977255.0,So true! Just have to look myself over carefully for tattoos or body piercings. And have to make sure I don't have a new loser boyfriend.
bipolar,et06fkb,t3_c9jmne,1562373548.0,"But...big but here...without abilify which I hate, I get psychotic, and paranoid as hell. Its take it or see and hear unreal stuff. Bites!"
bipolar,esmv4hl,t3_c88id5,1562115571.0,I just wish showing myself compassion didn't include a handful of pills every day!
bipolar,esh0j9b,t3_c7l6di,1561976863.0,"Is it possible to be calm through mania? I feel like I have it together but my behavior speaks otherwise. It's my sexual behavior that worries me...I'm not sleeping around, but being tempted and want to. I'm ok money wise...don't have any...on disability. I take lamictal and abilify.  Just want the hypersexuality to vanish."
bipolar,es8t6zt,t3_c6aa9m,1561713430.0,"It works ok until symptoms pop up. I mean the kind I get where I need to be left alone until I'm stable again. Can't tolerate anyone trying to help, it's like I lose all my emotion and become a stone woman. Normally I'm very affectionate and into my partner.  I have lost a few, and feel it's really hard to explain my pattern. Then I become hypersexual. That really throws them off. So I agree with honesty, but I think full disclosure has to be done a little at a time."
bipolar,es5xa71,t3_c5z1dx,1561632900.0,I went out with a decent guy for three months after not dating for years...62. Then was suddenly repulsed by him. It was suddenly way too much way too soon and he was always there! I tried to explain but he thought his presence would help matters. Only made me feel worse. So I ended it. Feels like there's only room for one person in my personal space or I get sick. Damn.
bipolar,ersgn2y,t3_c3iept,1561213466.0,"Thanks so much for this. Yesterday  someone asked me what I've been up to and I answered just trying to keep my head on straight. She said me too. I thought you have no effing idea how different that is between us. She can work, handle a family, an aging mother, things that would make me hide out and get psychotic. So hell yes when we we make it through a day unscathed, kudos to us all!!"
bipolar,erpcd8t,t1_ernjte6,1561110943.0,"Yes and it feels amazing like a clear pool of water. I always wish I could put my brain aside until it feels functional again and then take it back to be spared the crud of it all. I'm going on a ten day vacation and am hoping I will stay level, but new bright shiny things seem to trigger mania. Wish me luck ok?"
bipolar,erftqnz,t3_c1o0wb,1560817668.0,Hippity hop. Mania won't stop.
bipolar,eqr6ega,t3_byxere,1560250436.0,"So what about that emotional flatline when suddenly you feel nothing? No love, no hate, no kind of emotion.  My partner of three months had that experience recently and took it really well. I hate like hell to hurt those people I care about but when I have a down episode all I want is to be left the hell alone. Then I fill my pail back up and pour it on. This shit's crazy!"
bipolar,eoz2l1j,t3_bt6fbc,1558952597.0,"Last time I was in wasn't too bad. I kept trying to get the orderly to see my hallucinations so that was even a little funny. The lack of mirrors is weird and the nurse station behind thick glass or plastic or whatever it is is weird, but I had a cool sociol worker, didn't have to go to any group therapies...did have to get approval for a rubberband for my hair. I had a good doctor. That was my third stay in that hospital and by far the best. Got out in three days under my sisters care. After one month of mania and psychosis though, and my poor baby dog dying while this went on, it took 6 months to recover."
bipolar,eosrsgw,t3_bsvuys,1558828160.0,Really putting yourself out there...thanks. very cool.
