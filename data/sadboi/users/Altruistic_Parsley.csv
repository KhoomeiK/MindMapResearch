needadvice,fbwdp3b,t3_ees83s,1577147201.0,Thank you for this thoughtful insight you‚Äôre absolutely right about the seemingly blurred lines between loneliness and being alone I guess I‚Äôve just been on my own for so long and had a really Traumatic several last year so I isolated myself from friends and family that did value me and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm learning how to just be human again and I want and need that human connection and know that I have a lot to offer people . I just get shy But I try to keep an openness and warm energy And I value that people pick up on that
