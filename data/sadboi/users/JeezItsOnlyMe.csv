Don't let jammies intimidate! When you make pj bottoms, grab a pair you already have that fit well. Measure your lines/material against those and leave some extra seam space. Always better too big than too little! If elastic is frustrating, try a drawstring. You can sew most of it right in while you sew the waist seam (just be sure not to sew the string to the pants) or work it through with a pen, and you won't have to worry about bunching.
