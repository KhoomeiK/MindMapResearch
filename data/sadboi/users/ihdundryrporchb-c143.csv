depression,fowsh78,t3_g9ndgw,1588126184.0,I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 11 and I died less than a year later. It will be 30 years next February and I don't know if I will make it.

marriageadvice,fo9k265,t1_fo9goxb,1587621802.0,"I hope things get better for you, too. I'm having a hard time figuring out my next moves with this virus thing. He screamed at all of us again tonight. I asked him to leave and he refused. Ugh. 

Hey, I am sorry you think you might not get to have kids. We got pregnant again after losing our first at 19 weeks gestation, and go figure it was twins and the pregnancy nearly killed all three of us. Then, I was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer when they were 5 months old and almost died again (my husband thinks he actually GAVE me cancer because of the trauma he put me through when they were little, which is pretty depressing). I am leaving with the hope that my kids still have a Mom in a few years, as the kind of cancer I had was nasty and comes back. This is part of the reason I feel so stuck. 

Gah, it's gotta get better sometime, right??!? 

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck."

marriageadvice,fo90g1b,t1_fo8ne7l,1587607761.0,"I am sorry to hear about your fiancÃ©.... I have lost many friends in the same way, and my ex had a problem with heroin, cocaine, crack... the heroin was the worst though. 

It is funny, going into this marriage I though that the weed wasn't going to cause issues like the ones I saw in my ex. I was surprised. While the acuity of the threat to my ex's health was always greater, I wonder what this new situation I am in does to families if it is left to inch forward like a slow moving trainwreck. I am not going to wait to find out. I am getting strong, have been in therapy, and we have been in marriage counseling for a little while so we can learn to be in the same house without wanting to murder one another, at least until things are better or this virus thing is over and we can get a divorce. 

Now that I am writing this all out, it seems worth mentioning that the toll to my mental, and eventually, physical health has been greater this time, probably for a couple of reasons but at least my ex could talk about things when he sobered up. All I get is avoidance now, and it makes it hard to have a healthy relationship.

Again, I apologize for sounding condescending... I really didn't mean to! Thanks for sharing what you did; addiction fucking sucks, and I agree that ""harder"" drugs are definitely more of a problem for the average person than weed is, in general. The biggest problem with all of this is when people don't have enough effective healthy coping mechanisms to get through the hard parts of life, I guess. 

I wonder what happened to my ex now. I know he's still around, because I think someone would have called me if he had died. The last time we spoke, he said he had quit heroin another time and I am not sure if he did the methadone thing again or not. He was smoking a TON of weed, had no motivation, and was very depressed... but wasn't using junk. That was years ago. 

I really hope you've found some happiness since your fiance died, and that you have been able to move through your grief in your own way. I am so sorry that he is not here anymore, and also that this new(ish) fentanyl threat is what took him. I just heard back about a newly deceased friend's pathology report/tox screen, and they found fentanyl in him but that is not what he bought. It is horrific. 

The world seems to be spinning off its axis lately."

I think we lose control of all kinds of things; food probably being one of the most frequent things on the list. It's hard being a human."

marriageadvice,fo5347p,t1_fo4jyk7,1587516477.0,"Please don't minimize this. My husband has a traumatic past he has not sufficiently dealt with and has anger issues as a result; he is a horrible communicator. Instead of actually doing something about this (a very similar situation), he blows up on his family. Cannabis has blunted his motivation. He uses it as a coping mechanism which may appear to get him ""over"" an argument that was because of a conversation he didn't want to have or something pretty benign.... ""over""... to the couch, where he falls asleep and never addresses the issues. He would tell you the same thing; it has helped to demotivate and disable him over the long term. If you think cannabis is harmless, you're in denial. For most it may not be a problem and it is true that there is not a lot of evidence of physical addiction, but there is dependence in other ways that are unhealthy. I live in one of the finest cannabis cultivation areas there is... for generations.... and for generations cannabis has harmed this community.  Besides, my husband has all the addict behaviors around weed-- he has stolen money from me to buy it, ripped it off from dispensaries, lied plenty about it, has chosen it over his family at times, and has put us in financial distress because of it, plus he is having one hell of a time laying off of it. Now, I am **not** anti-cannabis, but I have been very close with it for a long time and I've been watching both at home and around me.... it is harmful to some individuals for certain."

I am terrified for so many children especially; everyone's mental health will be affected and I am glad you brought this up because if we could add the deaths due to domestic violence  and deaths by suicide (now and into the future) because of this virus, I think we'd have a more accurate picture of how deadly it really is. Of course those numbers will be left out and categorized as unrelated."
