It’s very unfortunate his parents are shaming him for something he literally cannot help. It doesn’t sound normal to me. I work with children and see everyday how these interactions affect their mental health. If you’re able too, talk with the parents about it and tell them what their child said. 

If you can’t, be the example and show the kid that he’s loved and that mistakes are okay. You can’t shame a toddler for making them and expect them to be perfect.


Here are some articles that give tips on disciplining a toddler appropriately.

Atypical,f6s32dn,t3_dsvm9m,1573125829.0,"I agree 100%. People are upset and think she was playing with Casey’s feelings because she didn’t get with her right away but don’t understand that it’s not that easy for queer couples. When Casey and Evan started liking each other, they didn’t have to worry about being ostracized which is why it was so easy for them to accept their feelings and move forward with their relationship. Straight couples are the norm in society and are accepted without a second thought. Often times people who experience queer feelings find it hard to accept that part of themself and it can take YEARS before they come to terms with it or just don’t act on them at all. Honestly it’s something I really admired about Izzy because right away she knew she wanted to be with Casey and took that leap of faith despite what others might think. She knew that being with Casey was more important and I think that’s really brave."

I was sitting in the TV room in tears and I don’t remember what I was crying about but I decided to turned on the TV and episodes 36-37 (the eps where Koga is introduced) was playing and I just fell in love with it. I was having such a bad night but watching those episodes made it so much better. Unfortunately I had a rough childhood but this show gave me something to really look forward too during those hard times. I’ll never forget the first time I watched it and the feelings it gave me. 

12 years later I’m still a huge fan. I’ve gotten my boyfriend and a few of my friends to watch it and they really enjoy it. I’m going to dress as Inuyasha for an upcoming Halloween music festival. I named my cat Koga. I’m hoping at some point I can get an Inuyasha inspired tattoo as well. 😄"

BipolarReddit,eqktzty,t3_bypkcn,1560131095.0,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. I've been through this cycle before many times and it sucks.

If you want me to be honest, this just sounds toxic. It doesn't sound like a friendship that is bringing you happiness at the moment. I'm sure it did at some point but it sounds like you're torturing yourself in hopes that it will go back to the way it was.

Friendships shouldn't make you feel like you want to kill yourself. Even if you feel guilty for what you did, you don't deserve this type of suffering.  Normal, healthy friendships shouldn't have conditions either. I'm sorry but once a week contact? That just seems weird to me.

It sounds like this person is still angry and feeling that anger from them is only going to make you feel worse. I'm not saying that there is no hope for this relationship but for it to heal there NEEDS to be space.

You need let yourself off the hook. You can't punish yourself like this forever. You've realized your mistakes and your doing everything you can to change yourself and that's amazing. Please don't rely on this person, or any person for that matter, to feel happiness. You will always be let down. I know this because I have been in this exact position.

You are the only person who can make yourself happy and it takes so much time to learn how to do it but it is possible. Focus on other friends, if you don't have any, find some. Join support groups, take classes, or online meet ups. Find people who have similar hobbies.

Please. FORGIVE YOURSELF. You deserve to be happy. I know this sounds almost impossible but please trust me when I say I HAVE BEEN THERE. It took me years to learn this and I'm still learning how to love myself but with practice you naturally start feeling happier because you don't need other people to make you happy. When you feel more confident, people naturally flock over to you and you make much more meaningful, stronger friendships.

&#x200B;

Hang in there. Please DM if you need someone to talk to. Best of luck to you."
