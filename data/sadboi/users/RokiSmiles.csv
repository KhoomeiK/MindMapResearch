The only part that makes me question it is how much detail they gave about the physical interaction- but then again, people have different writing styles and tend to emphasize different things. 

My personal guess is that the coughing happened, but the “Palm-to-hand” didn’t. Like, the person was to close, OP of the tweet glared and they had their mini confrontation, and then the asshole coughed on them- so tweet OP moved up or told a staff member. 


But then again, there is the video of that dude coughing (?) on oranges and getting the shit knocked out of him, so who knows?

Now feeling uneasy, I grab both the dogs and have them walk with me into the house, where I notice a bloody hand print on the wall right next to the door and a few drops of it on the floor. When I get to the living room it’s completely ransacked- pictures shatter on the ground. furniture turned over, and our TV is halfway across the room on the ground and there’s more blood- all around the TV. 

I call my mom and 911 and the police (and my mother and I as well) quickly realize that the robbers broke in through the back door, (police discovered that our lock had been broken off completely) tried to steal the TV, but were attacked by the dogs. (With Dean being a German shepherd and Cassie being a hound/Pyrenees mix, It couldn’t of been fun) 

The police found more blood towards the end of the driveway (how I didn’t notice it myself I’m still not sure) and spent half the time just petting our dogs and telling them they did a good job.

I was in the community on twitter for a while, and it got so unbelievably toxic it was ridiculous. You couldn’t make a fucking *joke* without causing drama with someone, people were constantly sub tweeting one another, and people were making “troll” accounts where they claimed to ship members of the lunch club, despite them making a video saying it made them uncomfortable. (That video in of itself caused so much shit, people claiming that it caused “Stan hate fuel” ??? Like, they didn’t say they hated stans, they said they didn’t want to be shipped together-) 

I finally left when I made a simple joke in the comments about how “maybe Carson doesn’t upload much because all we do is bully him lmao” and OP and several others lost it on me-

I fucking hate twitter stans. I mean, there are plenty of good people on there, but the toxic people are way to prevalent for me to ever return."
