They are mostly conservative and have made it clear that they aren't interested in wearing masks (the mask part is based on the few regulars I've kept in contact with.) C. Masks aren't a requirement for guests and there aren't any guest # limits in place on Mike Dewines current reopen plan which is fucking insanity. 

My live-in girlfriend (age 28) works for two people whose immune systems are compromised and we've had to be tediously careful so as not to introduce the virus to them, and now my restaurant is opening and the last thing I want to do is contract the virus and pass it to them via her. 

I guess I'm wondering how to obtain a mask that not only prevents me from passing the virus, but one that actually filters some stuff I breathe in. I know they have been reserved for front-line workers, but the way I see it, I'm heading back into the buzzsaw.
