Coronavirus,fk3xvh1,t1_fk3vafk,1583848967.0,"It most certainly is not a cold. It has cold-like symptoms, and flu-like symptoms, but is neither of those things. It is Sars-Cov-2. A coronavirus that can give people the disease, currently named, Covid-19. They didn't add the words cold, flu, etc, because they didn't want people to think it was like a cold, or a flu, etc."
Coronavirus,fjwzqkz,t1_fjv9qzt,1583650525.0,"Optimism my friend, fact is, the virus is being pretty closely watched, and we'll get through this okay. Not to mention if NYC becomes another wuhan, which is unlikely, that'd mean that things would start looking better in a couple of months. Its important to remain positive! :)"
Coronavirus,fjwxjcb,t3_ff8non,1583648633.0,"It also doesn't make sense in terms of how these things mutate. If it were to be more aggressive, it would also, work in smaller areas and be easier to test for"

Anxiety,fjdi3ak,t3_eupik4,1583253128.0,"Went to work yesterday, my coworker just came back from a cruise to Florida and Aruba, came back sick. He was coughing and sneezing without covering his mouth. We serve food and he wasn't wearing gloves.. my anxiety got so bad about it I called my manager and told him i was going home. Idk if thats ridiculous or not, it feels justified, but i know it was also my anxiety talking, not me."

LSD,erwis7o,t1_erwicvn,1561344876.0,"Im sorry anyone else has to go through this. I actually similarly stopped cigarettes, weed, alcohol, and lucy. Because i was convinced it had to do with that, it helped. 
If you're like me, I'm pretty much always high except for if im working or attending a family function. I stopped, and then 4/20 came along. i still don't drink as much as i used to, and i quit cigarette 100 percent, but i went back to smoking weed, and im not trying to justify it, but it just helps me relax sometimes."
