mildlyinteresting,foo0uus,t3_g892eg,1587930295.0,"Hmmm, maybe it’s a little late to post this, but I wanted to be clear about several things.
First, my age has nothing to do with me considering if this is old or not. When using technological appliances, “the old one” is used for the one you don’t use anymore.
Second, this IS considered old. An average “lifespan” for a microwave is 7 or 8 years. I know many people still use their 15 year old microwaves, and yeah, their microwaves are old. 
Third, TOSTADOR is Spanish for toaster lol. I got a real laugh out of people pointing it out, just wanting to put this out there.

I’m aware that many of you don’t consider this to be old, but, as I said in one comment. 12 years is a lot of years in microwave years. Functionality goes down, increasing the time it takes to heat up something. It also increase the risk of not functioning properly, which kind of scares me a bit in this “toaster-microwave” scenario.
