LGBDropTheT,flm2des,t1_flk8rcc,1585272984.0,"This is why I never said I was bi,  even in my teenage years. I dated women because I was in doubt about my sexuality but I realized that even though I could fall in love with woman and date them it was different then being with a guy. 
Back then, sexuality was pretty much straightforward, lesbian, gay and bi. Period. And even though my friends started to tell me that I was a lesbian and not even bi I felt like a fraud and never even claimed being bi. In my head, claiming being bi or lesbian was disrespectful towards actual lesbians and bi people. So, I said I was straight. Even while dating another woman, I said I was straight. According to many people, it was internalized homophobia but no, not at all. I liked those girls and I was aware I was just like anyother teenager confused with my sexuality and experimenting. There was one time I really considered that I might be a lesbian after all because felt hard for a girl. 
But no, it passed. And I realized that I loved her not the fact that she was a woman. 
It's different with man. I like man because I like dick. I liked that girl so much that I was okay with the fact she didn't had a dick and wasn't a male. See the difference? 

So many teens and even youngsters in the lgbtq+ community lack this self awareness and long so much to be ""different"" and ""cool"".
Sexuality is something serious, not a quirky personality trait. It's okay to experiment to find out what you really like, but do it respectfully. It's okay thinking you like a gender but finding you actually don't but be honest with yourself and those around you.

IT'S OKAY TO BE CONFUSED.

what is not okay, is going around the Internet and life telling other people what their sexuality is supposed to be and how they should expressed it. Telling them it's a ""choice"" because for you it's a choice thus something you don't take seriously is disrespectful at the bare minimum. These people are immature and lack awareness and I can't help but cringe and roll my eyes at them. Ugh."
