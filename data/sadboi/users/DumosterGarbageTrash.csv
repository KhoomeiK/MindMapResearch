Going to just start with conversation though.

The biggest problem is that the college itself didn't really do enough to make me aware that money was coming. They kind of just send it every semester and don't say anything digitally, it's odd. Their loan and scholarship systems have been switched to be fully automatic so things just go through and I have to really watch the mail. The thing is is that he's never done anything like this before so I wasn't expecting it and I just kept thinking that the check was late until he admitted to taking it and depositing it a month or two later. Haven't been sure what to do about it until now, so going to talk to him about it tonight. Now I know exactly what laws he broke and can use that as leverage in the discussion to get my money."

What you are forgetting is that Destiny 2 is too close to its own max memory size in order for them to keep adding things. Bungie themselves are in a tight spot right now.

That’s just how competitive games work. You have general strategies for winning and not all equipment is going to work.

When you try to artificially throw things into the meta, you just end up with shitty gameplay (see Pre-nerf LoW).

Players pick the meta, it’s so absurd to be like “X gun is useless against Y change meta snackdaddy.” Like, a few thousand players got really good with X gun and you’re losing to it. If you’re gut response is to be for X gun to be nerfed so you can use your stupid toy, then you’re a scrub. You don’t have a winning mindset.
