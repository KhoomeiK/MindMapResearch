BipolarReddit,fpehv5h,t3_gcrsy7,1588547853.0,"I use a lot of DBT techniques in my day to day life.

Like if I want to binge eat instead I'll drink water or watch a video to distract. Just today I felt some generalized anxiety well up inside me so I took deep breaths, did a body scan, became aware of my sensations, took a walk and drank water. You just have to be aware of your mind and body and not let yourself fall down into ""rabbit holes"" of thinking. My friend calls them simulated hells. Like when you're ruminating on a situation that could even be a hypothetical or imagined situation, and your monkey brain is just preoccupied with it. That's mostly for the manic side, but it works for depression too. Just be mindful and aware. I also quit almost all recreational drugs like weed, acid, shrooms, etc. I think they don't act well on us. Since I quit these, I haven't had a full blown episode."

As for the Db chord, you can think of it as a substitution for the V chord I think. It's a bVII chord and you can think of it in a couple of different ways. It's a borrowed chord from the parallel minor, or you can think of it as the ""IV of IV""  because Db is the 4th degree of the Ab scale (which is the 4th degree of Eb which the tune is in!)
