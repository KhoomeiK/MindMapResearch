\- If I didn't understand how to do classwork, I would shut down and just cry. I could not just ask for help. Some teachers thought I was being resistant and would send me to the principal's office.

\-I felt uncomfortable being the ""line leader"" (head of the line of kids). 

\-I felt uncomfortable ordering different cafeteria food than the other kids; especially if others thought it was ""gross."" Similarly, I didn't like sharing my favorite food preferences if they seemed strange.

\-I didn't like revealing what toys I played with or my play-style. 

\-I think I generally just didn't like talking about my family, my experiences, or any of my preferences with others.

\-I felt uncomfortable being around others in my favorite outfits/clothes.

\-Being quiet or known as ""shy""

\-Sometimes playing alone or turning down the invitation to play.

\-Report cards always said that I needed to ""come out of my shell more.""

\-Being apprehensive to go to the library, the lunchroom, the front office, or nurse's office.

\-Being scared of teachers, the lunch ladies, the bus driver, etc.

\-Being sent to ""special classes"" or counseling because the teacher doesn't know how to deal with you.

\-Having to repeat a grade (I repeated first grade) because of ""mysterious reasons."" Because SA can be invisible to your parents--they don't understand that something is wrong.

\-Always clinging to your parents or siblings when not at home.

\-Avoiding family members at family functions.

That's all I got so far. Sorry for the inconsistent list. Honestly, I'm shocked because I just realized that many of them I still struggle with as an adult. It hurts thinking that despite all of these signs, my parents never noticed anything wrong and still act like nothing is."

I am constantly going back and forth thinking I do/don't have what it takes; especially dealing with social anxiety, being indecisive, etc. I feel like if I failed a class or something similar, I would feel super guilty about it and not want to go back.

Because we share a lot of the same fears, it's really hard for me to come up with advice for you. There is a lot to think about like: 

Did you *actually* fail? Would others say the same, or would they just go on with their life?

Do you have to go to graduate school to excel in life? Do you have to go to graduate school right now?

Do you need to try a different program or a different school?

Are you proud of what you have achieved already despite ""failing""? Can you pinpoint any benefits that came from your failure? 

Would it be better for you to take a longer break from school?

Anxiety,f4s0uec,t3_dllynw,1571773396.0,"Yes, I relate. I got my first permit early-on around age 16 but I didn't end up getting my license until I was 21-22 because of the anxiety. I never took driving lessons with strangers, so props to you! I recommend getting some chill training with a parent when/where there is little traffic. The more you drive and encounter people, the more your confidence and anxiety will get better."
Anxiety,f4rxmk7,t3_dljy60,1571772565.0,I relate. Sometime we need to scale how severe our mistakes are; most of the time they could be so much worse.
socialanxiety,f4rtq6z,t3_d6dswh,1571771513.0,I need help on this too. It especially sucks when talking with people who naturally scowl and furrow their brows when they are in deep thought or listening to people--- it's so off putting/unapproachable.
socialanxiety,f4rd119,t3_dlkgnk,1571765931.0,I would show the hairdressers pictures from online sources or pictures of yourself when the haircut is perfect
socialanxiety,f4rbfjs,t3_dlbm6q,1571765343.0,"You can somewhat find out if you are suitable (doesn't mean smart/dumb) by seeing how well you do in some of the related classes. Take a few and see how you do and how you feel about it.

Keep in mind that everybody starts out ""dumb."" You are learning stuff in college to build up your intelligence. Even outside of college, people are always learning. You can always ""correct"" your ""dumbness"" if you need, but I doubt you will need to :)"
socialanxiety,f4r6aeu,t3_dlfn5n,1571763373.0,I think it couldn't hurt
socialanxiety,f4r4pbz,t3_dlhtxy,1571762689.0,Try to choose the option you would pick if you didn't have anxiety. You got this!
Anxiety,f4r2e37,t1_f4oval2,1571761629.0,"This though. A counselor once trying to walk me through a grounding exercise to ""calm down"" but it didn't really work. My mind was fairly calm, yet my body just chooses to shake, etc. It makes it unpredictable how I will act if it is somewhat unconscious."
Asexual,f4mnzy5,t3_dl3es4,1571680621.0,I think many people don't understand that the vagina has very little sensation to begin with.
socialanxiety,f4mml6d,t3_dkpkwe,1571680181.0,"It's weird because in grade school I used to dress so plain and out-of-date because I was too self conscious to wear nice things---I avoided complements. Ditto with makeup. Fast forwarding to now, I feel more myself and confident, BUT GUESS WHAT

Now I struggle wearing things that make me look too rich, too pretty and perfect, and stuff that makes me look my age because my social anxiety makes me appear to be not those things. For example, I can't be rich/successful if I've never worked a day in my life, I seem way younger than I really am because I can't ""adult"" on my own, and what good is faking perfection when I know I'm not? :/"
socialanxiety,f4mimlq,t3_dl0ekq,1571678809.0,"Try to relax and take it day by day. Don't forget to exercise. You can use your free time to take on small social challenges. Better yet, why not email your classmates to study together?"
socialanxiety,f4mhbly,t3_dl1lma,1571678366.0,"Most of the time I present with a visual aid such as PowerPoint so that people look at the slides and not me, AND the lights go dim; meaning they can't see my red face. I practice so, so much. I get tired of presenting the whole presentation 10-20 times; but it helps me not stutter/forget. I also sing in the car or something beforehand so my throat is ""prepped."" I've also considered using red/bright PowerPoint slides, so if you are near the presentation, it just looks like a cast of color."
socialanxiety,f4l3mpn,t3_dkxegl,1571661823.0,"If there are many people who are spread out, then you don't really have to worry about eye contact, but if it's 1 or 2, you probably should aim to make eye contact with each person *at least* a couple of times. Sometimes you can get away by staring in their general direction but not actively making eye contact. Alternatively, you can just take the lack of points. Just try; and if you get some points off, don't beat yourself up. Good luck!"
socialanxiety,f4jknaj,t1_f4jfqo9,1571621288.0,I was thinking the same thing. It ends up not being that weird!
socialanxiety,f4jjpxl,t1_f4ihgxs,1571620813.0,Me neither. Maybe as time goes on things will go back to normal.
socialanxiety,f4gwvrd,t3_dke9ru,1571585824.0,"I relate, but I'm female; same age. I do sometimes feel art/ creative stuff is kinda the only thing I feel notable for, but I'm somehow okay with that. Talents go a long way in my opinion; so it's really cool you can do piano and art stuff. Lean more in your talents perhaps?"
socialanxiety,f4gtup9,t3_dkj5n8,1571584681.0,"Generally people's anxiety subsides as they get older; partly because they live long enough to get some degree of exposure therapy. Just don't jump into something too difficult at once, or it may back fire."
AskReddit,f4gjafv,t3_dkeh0y,1571581675.0,Actually reading the terms of use
AskReddit,f4cdp9n,t3_dk3ggz,1571527751.0,Introverts are less valued than extroverts
socialanxiety,f48zjz4,t3_djt81r,1571453264.0,I feel shi\*\*y because I'm boring adult-child compared to everyone else. I'll always feel behind in life and like I could never reach the top rungs of society because I have so much to work on in such a little time it seems.
