SuicideWatch,flo2f38,t3_fpp2qc,1585330367.0,"True. I got told that it's much better to be smart and have a good personality but honestly, whoever told that has never experienced the mortifying pain of the blank stare and other people's gazes skipping over you. 

Being ugly is so tiring. You have to be smart, funny and interesting just to compensate for your ugliness. It's a daily ""pick me! Pick me!"" nightmare."
lonely,flo1707,t3_fpumor,1585329725.0,I relate to this. It's partly because I experienced those embarrassing flashbacks where I finally gain some self-awareness that i'm being over-eager and annoying the people I'm around. I get so scared that i'm being clingy that I clam up. I just want someone to talk to me so that I'd know that they weren't just there because they were trapped into speaking with me.
