EUGENIACOONEY,fqxesnj,t3_glexm5,1589731131.0,"I was anorexic and bulimic, my low weight was nowhere near Eugenia, but I got to BMI 16. My goal had been to have the perfect healthy diet, not to starve myself, so i usually ate 3 (tiny) meals a day. I convinced myself my diet was amazing and my binge purging was just a flaw in me, not a side effect of malnutrition. Ha. 

Given how utterly awful I felt at the end, I cannot imagine how terrible someone feels at eugenias size. I am still afraid of the utterly insane hunger, all day, all night, only assuaged briefly during small meals. I remember one night I was so hungry I could not sleep so went to the kitchen and ate *literally raw cabbage* then felt really guilty. I was also extremely weak, not quite to the point of passing out, but feeling light-headed and dizzy all the time. I'd have to lay down on the ground sometimes after working out or playing flute, which for some reason I thought was normal. Walking around started to feel absolutely exhausting, it's a weird bone-deep exhaustion.

I'm lucky in that my new boyfriend (now husband 11 years later) knew I was extremely unhealthy and forced me to seek help before things got worse. The first psychiatrist I saw at my University was so clueless, when I started describing my symptoms she said ""so what size clothing do you wear? Must be the smallest?"" Like, wtf kind of question is that. But luckily she referred me to an excellent psych and eating disorder nutrition center, who helped me recover. 

Even though my life actually has meaning and substance now other than calories, I feel 1000x better, and I can happily go out to eat with friends without stress, part of my fucked up eating disorder brain *still* romanticizes that time in my life and the perception of self-control and organization I had. So I can see how someone like Eugenia who has been so ill for so long just cannot handle the anxiety of being recovered. Even though she obviously feels like utter shit, this is her normal now, and she'd rather feel terrible but have dulled anxiety, than healthy and have to deal with her feelings."

WeightLossAdvice,fp2qgez,t3_gavsd1,1588266171.0,"Hi! This is definitely getting towards eating disorder territory. As someone who is now recovered from anorexia and bulimia please believe me! My main advice as others said is to seek professional help from an eating disorders therapist, they will be able to guide you through this. 

My advice for how to change your eating behaviors and thoughts is that it is hard and it takes time, but with repetition, normal eating will become your new behaviors. It just takes time to rewire your brain. For example, week 1 could be a couple attainable but not too lofty goals, like, eat 2-3 meals during the day of healthyish food, even if you don't want to, even if you don't feel hungry. Then, you will be less likely to binge in the evening. I struggled a lot with binge purging and I always beat myself up about it until I realized that , lo and behold, if I was eating properly, my body wouldn't crave a binge. One more small piece of advice-try not to beat yourself up for slipups or not recovering fast enough. All or nothing attitudes are a huge problem with eating disorders, being able to exist in grey areas is hard for us. You got this xoxo"

My options at this point for my own sanity are to cut the friendship off completely or to somehow help her but I don't know how to help."
EUGENIACOONEY,fod263j,t1_focnru0,1587678923.0,"Severe anorexia is not about ""looking better"", but about being ""the best"" at your disorder. The wise she looks and the more posts and comments she sees about her emaciated appearance, the more her disorder is fed"
EDAnonymous,fo8uuai,t3_g6310b,1587604311.0,"yeah when I was restricting and really underweight I literally could not exercise without feeling super weak shaky and dizzy. I remember many times having to lay down by the treadmill after finishing 20-30 minutes because I just. could. not. stand. I never understood how ppl who ate less and weighed less than me could exercise! *Sigh*

Honestly a large part of what helped with my recovery is now I am super into healthy exercising like climbing running etc and I absolutely need to feed my body properly for that"
EDAnonymous,fo3ei8m,t3_g5gq76,1587485536.0,"Holy shit that is beyond fucked up. you don't deserve to be treated like that. Period. I would dump my husband's ass if he said anything like that to me.

You are not unworthy. Monogamy IS part of your relationship, not literally having trashy sister wives"
EDAnonymous,fo3dyd6,t3_g5dolk,1587485262.0,"girl I am SO SORRY this happened to you. You need to know that you are most definitely NOT a fat bitch, those girls were bitches who are so insecure they need to drag others down to make themselves feel better. 

I'm guessing you're in high school or so? I'm almost 30 now but I sure remember the terrible bitchy things teens say and do. I have some awful memories that still haunt me to this day. I also remember being an absolutely terrible mean person to others as well, teen years are a rough time. I know it may not seem like it now, but this all will change, I promise you that. A lot of middle/high schoolers tend to have very little sense of empathy, and this combined with being insecure and unsure of your identity leads to abject cruelty towards others. You clearly are a much more mature person, and I respect you so much for that. 

Keep with recovery ‚ù§Ô∏èAs others said, it takes some time for your body to redestribute the weight and realize you are not going to be depriving it anymore. And, there is NOTHING wrong with being very slightly medically overweight! BMIs are guidelines, NOT hard rules. Literally every single person has a different natural body shape. Is it worth hurting yourself again to please asshats like those girls? I hope you know you are beautiful and amazing and don't let this ruin your recovery. Xoxoxoxoxo"

EatingDisorders,fm2dgrq,t3_fsmm1j,1585695291.0,"People who don't have eating disorders view meals in such a completely different light, they probably just think it's kind of funny to point out your food choices, wouldn't even consider it would be triggering. That said, doesn't make it any less frustrating. 

When I was anorexia restricting (many years ago at this point) in college I was always annoyed at people constantly making comments on my food choices and how I just ate vegetables, small amounts, etc. Honestly, what was worse was when I started recovery and people would make comments like Oh wow you eat SO MANY TIMES in one day you're eating all the time. Basically anyone commenting on what I ate was frustrating. 

Now as an essentially fully recovered person I no longer can imagine caring about these comments. I think it's because after several years (repetition repetition is everything with recovery) of expanding my food choices and learning it's ok to eat ""normal"" meals, something shifted in my brain. So I know it sucks now, but if you stay strong with recovery, these types of things get better. Xo"

You have a good idea-in fact, those drugs are already in clinical trials! You don't actually need a system like LOCKR system to teach your body to eat cancer cells that express a don't eat me signal. You just need an antibody or protein that blocks the ligand on cancer cells (CD47) from interacting with the receptor on immune cells (Sirpa) . There's some great literature on these drugs, look up Forty Seven Inc, the company doing the clinical trials :)"
