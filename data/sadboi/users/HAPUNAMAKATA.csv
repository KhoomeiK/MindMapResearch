australia,fopnc8p,t1_foozdur,1587966210.0,"Lower wages, more unemployment, less opportunities, greater taxes due to government debt and/or austerity cuts to government services.

Different sectors of the market will be hit differently. Higher taxes generally means higher prices for goods. Produce and necessities will likely stay the same, but luxury goods will almost certainty go up, as businesses have to compensate for a dwindling demand base. Sectors like higher education and  tourism will shrink massively. Unemployment there will go up as people get laid off. This cascades as a lot of other businesses rely almost entirely on tourism or the presence of universities. 

Consumer patterns will change as unemployment and instability rises. People will become more frugal.... which often further magnifies recessions, as the circulation of cash dries up. The role of government would be to intervene in this effect, but unlike recessions that are caused by financial crises, there are some things that no amount of government intervention can change as they are almost natural laws of life. For instance the threat travel, large sporting events and concerts pose to consumers would likely make so it that - even if the government gave you $500 to go spend it on something like that, you’d just never go.

The good news: stimulus works in the long run to buffer the blow of recessions. In circumstances like this there is no real alternative besides spiralling economic destruction. If we are clever with this we can exit this harsh period ahead of most others. The world economy will likely never look the same, but in that is an opportunity for new industries and new norms to flourish"

australia,fogon6l,t1_fofkj95,1587755195.0,"The earlier outbreaks in East Asia occurred during winter. Using social distancing these Asian countries have managed to mostly control the spread, just as we have, albeit much later so the scale is still a problem.

Diseases don’t magically get stronger in the winter, they just get more contagious. Some heat sensitive diseases can’t last that long in the sunlight so colder weather and less sun might marginally increase the time they stay around for . Diseases like COVID that spread primarily through contact with cough and sneeze residue become more contagious, as when you sneeze in thin, dry air, the particles can travel much further and cover a wider surface area. Humidity helps prevent this. 

With proper social distancing practices and general hygiene these marginal changes in how contagious the disease is contracted become basically negligible. What is far more threatening to our progress is complacency and poor decision making - something governments and individuals alike can actually prevent (not the inevitable turning of our blue marble around the sun). Invest some effort practicing the latter and hopefully all will be fine :)"

I’m not sure if I have COVID, but I know 100% I have anxiety.

Anxiety can cause fatigue, occasional shortness of breath, dry your mouth and trigger cough reflexes,  even psychogenic fevers - all of which are symptoms of COVID. 

However, anxiety is rarely TRULY painful. Except in cases of muscle tension and headaches. Instead anxiety is typically just uncomfortable, distracting and painful to you psychologically. 

Focus then on physical pain. Asses if the fever you’ve been feeling has been persistent. Assess how bad the body aches may be. Determine if you have a dry cough. If it doesn’t meet the pain threshold and instead feels just like a minor annoyance, it’s probably not COVID, and even if it is, it’s only a minor form. 

Don’t waste time ruminating over what it could and cannot be and please don’t google the random symptoms. If you get it, trust me, you will probably know it. And if you get it without knowing it, congrats, you’re now immune with little hardship to get to that point.

NintendoSwitch,fbo339j,t1_fbne4tu,1577006187.0,"I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. There’s really like 5 types of weapons in BOTW: two handed weapons, one handed swords, boomerangs, spears and bows. As you’d progress through the game you’d gradually upgrade each one of those weapon types, refusing to hold onto less powerful weapons. You’d have no incentive to upgrade your weapon slots beyond 5, since you could just swap out your current gear for more powerful gear when u find an objectively better weapon OR you could just ignore the weapon on the floor. Having weapons break incentivises you to pick up shittier weapons and seek out better weapons when your best weapons break.

It also incentivises you to go out and get the Mastersword, another system that is balanced by weapon breaking."
NintendoSwitch,fbm3sjf,t1_fblzlcd,1576977645.0,"You’re not supposed to collect and do everything. You’re supposed to organically wander through a world in whatever order you please with the expectation of continuity when it comes to core gameplay. The open world is not empty at all and weapons break for a reason (to encourage increasing inventory and continual exploration, also spontaneous combat). You can literally defeat Ganon immediately if you want to. It gives you unparalleled freedom. That HAS to be respected. And you must appreciate the challenges that provides. Few games pull it off as seamlessly that the biggest gripes are stylistic nitpicks.

I suggest you read my other comment addressing everyone’s criticism. BOTW shouldn’t be compared to the Witcher, Skyrim or Fallout. It’s not an RPG game. Fundamentally BOTW is a sandbox open world physics game that just so happens to have a non-procedurally generated world. It’s like Minecraft. In fact pretty much all of your criticisms could apply to Minecraft as well."
NintendoSwitch,fbm37zq,t3_edpmyv,1576977186.0,"Not sure if this will be seen, but a lot of people are commenting that they’re unsure why BOTW gets so much praise and that they found the game overrated and underwhelming. Allow me to address these criticisms.

The gripes people have with the game are entirely legitimate. As an RPG BOTW is fairly barebones. The quests are simple, items and loot isn’t that diverse (it’s basically swords, axes, bows and boomerangs) and enemy variety is narrow. The puzzles are simple and the story is pretty much nonexistent aside from a few optional cutscenes. 

While these issues would be detrimental in most other RPGs, BOTW is hardly an RPG. I think the main mistake people make going into it is thinking the gameplay experience will be akin to Skyrim or The Witcher - aesthetically they’re similar, what with swords and horses and shit, but gameplay wise and emotionally they simply are not. 

BOTW is an open world sandbox game with a non procedural world. It hands you an enormous diversity of systems, most of which appear “shallow” in isolation only because they’re being balanced within a wider sandbox toolbox that would deteriorate with more complexity. For instance, many complain about weapons breaking. But of course the entire purpose of this mechanic is to motivate people to solve Korok puzzles so they can expand their weapon slots. By expanding weapon slots you are given more variety when it comes the types of weapons you can carry. Certain weapons are made for certain enemy types, like the two handed big damage weapons for cyclopses, and mobile one handed weapons for Lynels. Adding more enemy variety without a reciprocal expansion of inventory and weapon variety would throw the game out of balance. Similarly, the physics sandbox is made with balance in mind. Metal weapons are generally more powerful but attract lightning in storms. Better armour exists but it won’t protect you from the elements so you’ll need potions or special meals to survive in those environments. Everything seems deliberate in how it’s crafted and the player is expected to actually experience everything the game has to offer rather than a sliver of the systems that only apply to the character you’re role playing as.

What this invoked for me was a very emotional response, something that I don’t imagine would be replicated for everyone. I vividly recall my first moments leaving the great plateaue and stumbling across that electric dragon near Lake Hylia and being filled with childlike wonderment and awe. I remember my first time encountering a Lynel and being truly terrified as it rushed towards me and killed me instantly. I remember coming across a bokoblin encampment while it was raining and blowing a bomb attached to a balloon with a korok leaf right behind them without them noticing. I remember using my sword as a conductor for electricity to solve a puzzle in a shrine. I remember realising you could hit flint to light a spark on a set of logs and then throw food onto that fire to cook it. It wasn’t like in other games where you interact with these systems just by crafting a campfire and then pressing a “cook” button. No. Everything had to be interacted with through the organic sandbox tools provided to you. And it’s by your own volition that you discover these things and utilise them when necessary. Pretty much every system seems shallow in isolation, but when combined they give the game a level of depth unparalleled to most modern open world RPGs. Yes Fallout (4) has a bunch of items and equipments and character building systems, but rarely do these ever become deliberately relevant or engaging except in rare moments of skill checks or rng serendipity. 

Moreover, BOTW is just a beautiful looking game. It isn’t super realistic, but it has this almost painting like quality to it that makes you feel like you’re truly living in a distant fantasy world. In this regard I feel BOTW is far more Minecraft than it is Skyrim. In Minecraft the graphics are simple, low resolution and most systems are fairly shallow. For a game about mining there’s only a handful of resources to mine, most of which are antiquated by diamond. But of course, if you describe Minecraft’s mining system without also describing its crafting system, of course the game will sound shallow. The whole beauty of Minecraft is that from such a simple core idea so much is able to be achieved with the combination of other deceptively simple ideas. 

To conclude, BOTW is a game about combining systems in a well balanced sandbox and using those systems to overcome the environment and enemies of Hyrule. When you describe it as a game that has shields, as a game that has a glider and as a game that has rain - all in isolation, you fail to capture the simple and potent concentrated fun factor of gliding down a rainy Hyrule field hill with your shield tucked between your feet and hitting the wet, rainy slope with your shield, surfing all the way down to a river ruin with a buried rusty sword that attracted lightning at just the right time to strike a lizard that you will later use in a potion to survive the scorching heat of a volcano without having to swap your armour."
NintendoSwitch,fbm015x,t1_fbko3up,1576974736.0,"You gotta view BOTW as a sandbox game where you the player make your own fun. Most of the time I spent playing the game wasn’t doing quests or puzzles, it was messing around with the physics system and riding on a horse/gliding/shield surfing enjoying the view.

 BOTW is a game about emotional moments, not intricate details that are supposed to be unpicked and criticised. Leaving the great plateau and stumbling across the electric dragon above the Lake Hylia bridge right at the beginning of the game felt amazing to me. It was like stumbling across a genuine mystery and it filled me with child like wonderment. I remember trying to shoot the dragon and erupting in ecstasy when I saw it “did something”. 

I vividly recall my first encounter with those Cyclopes giants, or the Lynels. They were points of emotional excitement and wonder to me. It felt like I was living in a fairy tale. To that extent I think you need to be emotionally invested in the experience, not the story or immediate gameplay or puzzles. Trying to rush the game as fast as possible will rob you of everything in between. As cliche as it sounds it’s really about the journey not the destination. I’m honestly really disappointed, for your own sake, that you missed out on the experience I (and many others) had."
NintendoSwitch,fblz8cr,t1_fbl0giw,1576974151.0,"I think it’s pretty great. I can see why other people might see it as generic or derivative but I think if you see it that way you’re sort of missing the point of the game. BOTW doesn’t reinvent RPGs or Open World games. It focuses on polishing a handful of fun, albeit largely unoriginal systems/mechanics (IE: puzzles, inventory management, cooking, climbing, gliding, trading, quests, etc...) to create a fun sandbox for you to explore and manipulate. The physics system pretty much epitomises this idea. Metal tools attracting lightning, statis objects used as transportation, attaching balloons to platforms, shield surfing... it isn’t ground breaking, it’s just fun."

Arabs in particular are the most dehumanised group with about 85% humanity according to Americans and 80% according to Brits. More generally studied have shown Americans are more supportive of indiscriminate civilian bombings of darker skinned peoples, even bombing the fictional city of Agrabah in Aladin. 

It is implicitly and universally understood amongst Americans that brown lives really aren’t worth as much as white lives. I’m a white passing mixed person and anecdotally it’s pretty clear this is the case. Yes it doesn’t always manifest in explicit violence, but it does manifest in implicit biases which can systematically cause violence. IE: the bias of African Americans being viewed as drug dealers/addicts resulting in greater arrests and harsher punishment for non violent drug “crimes” that are committed at the same rate across people groups.

MurderedByWords,fai1zqb,t1_faho9ss,1576098193.0,"Post modernism is fundamentally a skepticism of grand narratives, norms and theories. While it’s often framed in terms of philosophy, post modernism is just as much an artistic and architectural movement as it is anything else. Some of my personal favourite works of literature are post modern, particularly Catch-22, which ”rejected” literature norms by being chronologically scattered, deeply ironic and meta fictional. Although it conveys political attitudes (mostly anti-war) it’s label as a post modern work has more to do with its construction than explored themes. 

In essence, post modernism is essentially what Deadpool is to super heroes: meta, ironic, third wall breaking, cynical, skeptical and self aware."

Pretending that there is anything even remotely close to the racism African Americans experienced 100 years ago, or heck, even today with the School to Prison Pipeline and Criminal Justice System by white people is fucking ignorant and absurd. 

It really amazes me how degenerate this site can be sometimes, mass upvoting a shitty self-pitiful tirade about how some guy felt uncomfortable once because black people reminded his race and history was relevant once. It really shows the freedom white people have to live a life where people really are “race blind” - and when that freedom is violated they feel the act of simply reminding them they have a race and that race has a certain context being akin to lynch mobs and slavey. 

For the record, I’m sure some anti-white sentiment exists, but has it manifested in violence or overt racism in the same way that anti-black sentiments have... no! So don’t be a precious little self cantered snowflake and conflate the two. Part of actually combatting racism is being mature enough to see the experiences you face within a richer context. OP has completely stripped away or misrepresented the context to make people feel sorry for him for an incident that would’ve been an absolutely mild and negligible form of racism if it occurred to a black man, both compared to reddit’s wider reactions and sympathy and that black man’s daily experience."

news,f9vjban,t1_f9vgbut,1575671873.0,"Polls of Islamic countries have shown they are actually LESS likely to see political violence as justified.

Other polls have found a negative correlation between how important an individual finds religion and their tendency to support violence.

Theologically I don’t think there is a strong case to suggest Islam uniquely encourages violence. You can find violent verses in pretty much all scripture, which with context don’t sound nearly as bad as extremists and New Atheists pretend they are.

A biblical example is: “Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”

The reality is socio-political conditions cause extremism and violence irrespective of the religion of that area. Using religion as a scapegoat is convenient because it creates a narrative of global instability and violence that ignores the West/US’ role in causing it.

OCPoetry,f9j4daw,t3_e58qvb,1575355632.0,"I am assuming your formatting got messed up? It seems like the first line is supposed to be split into four, given the capitalization and rhyme scheme of A-B-C-B, IE:  


Some lift spirits,   
While others describe   
Some are never read   
While others thrive.

Assuming this was your intended formatting, I think on the whole you've crafted a pretty good poem here. Its very tight and focused in its scope and gets its message across. I think this can be owed to your tight pacing. Even though it follows an ABCB rhyme scheme, you get the impression, through repetition like (Some and While in the first stanza), that it is to be read two lines at a time. IE: 'Some lift spirits, while others describe' ... 'Some are never read, while other's thrive'.  The only advice I could give would perhaps be including a bit more imagery (or more potent imagery) to charge the piece with some emotion or depth. Otherwise, good job!"

The only thing I could suggest is perhaps adding more imagery. You use words like 'beautiful', 'disaster', 'overwhelming' and 'fight' which describe what you are feeling not HOW you are feeling it. If you could throw in an image that relates HOW you feel to visual appearance of a storm, perhaps how the firing of lightning resembles the neurons within your 'mind' (just spit balling here) or something playing on the inherent beauty of destructive natural forces (like love), you could really bring your poem to the next level.
