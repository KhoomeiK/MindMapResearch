Screw whatever you perceive as what other people think of you. Failed a class for a second time? Oh well. Doctorates fail classes all the time. Too old for college? Fuck that shit. One of my good friends from college is 60 and getting her bachelors. Getting your degree isn’t a rat race, it’s about elevating YOU and no one else. 

Go get disability from your university if you can, my process was super easy and it saved my ass senior year. I wish I knew about it freshman year of college. My GPA wouldn’t be such shit if I did that instead of pushing myself beyond what I could handle. 

Inspirational story:....My last semester of college I was failing my advanced psych class. 50%. Failed every exam and only had the final left. I binged on pre workout, studied all night the night before, was the the last person to walk out of the exam and I was convinced I failed...3 hours later I got a 98% on my final and got a C in the class."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fqq25nx,t3_gju8pj,1589558109.0,"I started doing my own laundry young because I was annoyed with my mom complaining. Since you can’t use their washer/dryer here’s my recommendations. 

1. See if it’s possible to get your own portable washer. 

2. Wash your clothes by hand, and dry them first with a salad spinner. Throw an article of clothing (bras, panties will be okay) and air dry. If you have a standing fan that would work even better. 

3. Try to reuse some articles of clothing. General rule “closer it is to the body, the less amount of time you can rewear it”. Don’t rewear your underwear but your bra should be used a few times before being washed. Jeans can be put in the freezer, but wash if it’s heavily spiked. Shirts - you can usually get about two wears out of them.

Watch Clean My Space on YouTube. I’m a 23 year old woman; and this is where I learned everything. I learned to clean quickly/effectively. Lots of info on how to do laundry, what laundry symbols mean, etc. I even make my own cleaning products which saves me a good amount of money. I bought her book because it’s a great reference.

If you’d like to create better dimension in the crease you’ll need different shades of brown. You’ll also need different sized crease brushes to get the effect you want. The lightest shade gets the biggest brush, and as you get to the darkest shade apply it very precisely. Blend between every shade change. Make it as seamless as possible. 

Blend up, never down to your eye lid. You want to bring in light the center eye lid to make it pop. Also side not please no SPF in your foundation, it may have flashback with flash photography.

Dobermans that work as guard/protection dogs need to have their ear cropped or else it’ll get blistered, infections, stitches, etc. 

These breeds aren’t always bred for strong tails. Dogs with naturally brittle tails are again extremely difficult to treat. Good luck getting a dog to not wag it’s tail, I’d have a better chance of finding Jesus reincarnated before my dogs won’t wag their tails. 

Lastly it can be removed for severe medical reasons. My pit bull almost lost his tail due to cancer. The only reason they didn’t cut it off was because of how bad the mass was, it just wasn’t worth it. They did cut off his ear tho.

bipolar2,fl9ypb8,t3_fnekgg,1584972678.0,"Before I start: I’ve gone what you’ve gone through. I know that pain. If you ever need someone to talk to my chat is wide open with loving arms. 

Yes I did. I’ve been diagnosed since I was 13. Shit was not easy. Trying to get my bachelors was a nightmare, I’m surprised I was even able to considering the circumstances. 

Fuck what everyone else thinks or says. They don’t know that they’re talking about. Did they go to school for psychology? Most likely no. My old roommate and I took an abnormal psychology course together. I was really the only reason she passed. Even after going over the study materials a bunch of times she still never was able to understand. My fiancé has been with me for 8 years since we were 16. He loves me more than anyone else in the world and he still gets confused. Unless someone directly struggles with mental health issues it’ll always be hard for them to understand. They’ll almost always go off the stereotypes they know because they don’t know better. Lions don’t give a shit about the opinions of a sheep. 

I won’t sugar coat it, being sick isn’t easy. Being sick since you’ve been young is hard. Yes you have a diagnosis, you have some answers to the looming questions in your mind. 10 years of treatment and I’m still going under another series of changing my meds to find something better. I’ve had to fight for my mental health, it took everything I had not to crumble under the stress. I wanted to work through my disorder with absolute desperation. I want it more than anything in this world. I have had to sacrifice everything. Dedicated time, blood, sweat, tears and sometimes even my own sanity. 

But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But you’ll need to light a torch to find your way through it. It won’t happen overnight. I can’t say I’ve made it out of my dark tunnel, but I’m a hell of a lot farther than I was. I still have so much work ahead of me, it will never be easy. But it has made me one of the strongest out of my peers. I fight with everything I have and I never give up. Even at my lowest, when I’m feeling suicidal and want to die, I don’t give up. My mind isn’t wired that way. Don’t give up. It’ll be hard. Life won’t feel like it’s fair. It’ll be painful. But it’ll be so fucking worth it when the battle scars have healed. This shit sucks, I wouldn’t wish being diagnosed bipolar on anyone. Even the worst people in the world don’t deserve this level of insanity. But it sure as hell has made me stronger and I’ll fight blood and nails till I make it."

changemyview,fl47r1c,t3_fmdwc4,1584807767.0,"My past 4 dogs have all been adopted from friends whose dogs had puppies or were neglected by their previous owners. They are so loving and wholesome and id do anything for them. 

But there’s a risk with adoption, and if you have kids it can be harder. Dogs need to learn how to be around kids and vice versa. My pit bull is from a neglected owner and since he’s officially claimed me as his master he’s been super protective of male strangers. It got him into legal trouble but since it’s been his first time biting someone he’s okay for now. On top of that he’s cost me over 5K in vet bills due to cancer complications and other related health issues. I adopted him in his mid to late years so I only have about 3-5 years max with him. 

With breeders you can get health background checks on the parents. If you go through verified breeders you’ll see higher quality of care. They take into consideration future health defects and try to breed them out as they can. It’s also much easier to adopt a puppy. I have never been able to choose the breed of dog I wanted, and shelters can make that increasingly difficult. 

For my next dog under normal circumstances I would’ve went to the shelter again. But my fiancé wants a puppy because he’s never had one before. He loves our dogs, his parents never liked animals, but I think at this point we deserve to have a healthier puppy. I’d like to be able to pick the breed out, and check their temperament. His cousin adopted a golden doodle that’s way too hyper for his family. He has 2 young babies and it’s hard for the family to juggle everything together. If they spent more time researching the right dog for their family they could’ve chosen a dog that’s more calm. 

There’s a time and place for both. It depends on the needs of the family, what they can afford, and for first time owners adoption could have additional risks they’ve never accounted for. I always try to advocate for adoption when possible but I’d rather people adopt the right dog. If that means going to a breeder then that’s okay too. It’s better than adopting the wrong dog that ends up in a shelter (sometimes multiple times) because someone didn’t do the research. 

I do however agree with neutering/spaying. My dogs had puppies because my parents didn’t care (asians. They see pets as animals, not part of the family). While being able to see the miracle of life was the most adorable experience that I would never want to replace, it also wasn’t the best. Lots of care, crying throughout the night, cleaning up messes, birthing complications, etc. Leave breeding to the professionals and fix your dogs."

SkincareAddiction,fkw9byy,t3_fkj8kb,1584586523.0,"I get really terrible cystic acne as it heals it either goes away into nothing, it turns into gross pus, or hardens as a clogged plug/pore. 

I’ve gotten to a point where I’ve learned how to sterilize a needle at home and carefully extract it. Fire, alcohol wipes, new needles as necessary, etc. I DONT do this until the pimple is CLEARLY ready to pop. If it’s a plug it just won’t go away and becomes increasingly irritating. 

After all is said and done and I sterilize the area of extraction I use a hydrocolloid patch. This is really the only reason I do at home extractions. The patch helps things clear up and heal over night. If it wasn’t for this it would crust and scar. 

Be smart. Ask a dermatologist about it. Yes it’s best to not touch it but let’s be real we all do. We’re human. If you’re going to do it at least do it safely as possible and learn the signs for when a pimple is ready to be popped."

Also a bidet is fantastic. Highly recommend if you have the money."
selfhelp,fksnd0b,t3_fkbjae,1584494003.0,"Strive for excellence, not perfection. Maybe you’re late, but better late than never. Let’s be honest, plans never go perfectly. That’s why you have to make adjustments constantly until you get your goal.  

You’re on your own path and your own journey. As someone who is incredibly guilty of it, stop paying attention to what everyone is doing and focus on yourself. Did Michael Phelps look at his competition when he won by 1/10th of a second in 2008 Olympics? No he didn’t. He was focusing on himself, and pushing himself forward to gold. If he wasted time even glancing at his opponent he would’ve lost. Don’t focus on your peers, look straight forward and work towards your goals. Use the time you have NOW to keep moving one step forward. Before you know it you’ll have climbed a mountain, while those peers are chilling out on a small hill. 

Stop comparing everyone’s highlight reel to your life. Social media is full of lies of lives people pretend to be living. Follow your own path in life and you’ll get to where you need to be. Keep hustling, but the things you want in life will come to you only when you’re ready."
