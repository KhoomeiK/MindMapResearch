MensLib,fqm3kkd,t1_fqm0mza,1589470903.0,"I come from a community where there I've known a few on both sides, and also there is the issue with how we treat the data. 

So first thing's first. What the other guy said is only sometimes true. The way men and women are socialized, men simply don't put as much thought into what their family is going to end up having to look at. They do put thought into what their family will have to *DO*, and so I see more men leaving a little bit of money aside to reduce the financial burden. In fact, this is more than a small thing. Yeah, men blow their brains out more, but it's more than a ""YOLO WHATEVS"" thing. It's more than a ""manly"" if you're going to do a job, do it right thing. 

Men blow their brains out to try and make sure the job is done, leave a little money on the side for whatever funeral or something, but also because family don't get stuck with a million dollar bill for hospital stay, rehab, and otherwise putting them back together. It's a huge aspect of an average male, that their ability as a breadwinner goes on to define how they see themselves. Think men flying out of upper story windows in 1929 after losing their life savings. 

Women are indeed socialized that appearance matters a lot. Must appear put together, even when not. Must appear to have it all when inside depressed as all fuck. Must have 3000 selfies before picking the best one for the morning IG. 

It's not a women thing, it's a social thing. I had anorexia, am a dude. I shopped in nice places and got jacked in the gym later in life. I took 3000 selfies before we called them that. 

Women also tend to hold onto the hope that someone cares, and will test it. Fuck, my GF, progressive as hell, sometimes isn't even aware that she is testing me by seeing just how long it takes me to notice something myself with ADHD will never notice and then gets sad about it. It's like, just because you pointed it out, doesn't mean I appreciate it less. But that's not people are raised. 

So take a bottle of pills, drop some hints on social media, and wait. If you wake up, someone noticed and cared, and thus congrats, you deserved to live afterall. Fucked up, huh?

While men pretty much know that there are times their own moms don't give a shit, don't have no money to see a doctor that is willing to take the time to understand what they are feeling, and decide one day, fuck it, Boom, done. No hope, so why drag it out?

Regarding DATA: Drug overdose is in same category as suicide. Think about how stupid that is for a second and then question everything you thought you knew about the data, because now there is this additional layer, seeing as drug use happens for all kinds of reasons, where only some are because of depression or a desire to die. 

Some people don't want to die either. Some wish they didn't exist. Where do you put those people, because there are a fuck ton of them. There just isn't a way for that to be possible and so they are here, but you might as well add a row and call them Ghosts, because that's essentially what they are. If they could not exist without having to commit suicide, they would. 25% (at least, but seems like more) of almost every millennial I meet as at some time stepped into this category."

Like, I know where I am definitely not going to be putting a line or if I draw one off this one, it's going to curve off to the right, or else, if I curve off to the left, then the next one must be off that one and more off to the left, but after that it's ok to drop one on there and then go back out to the right, even all way to until it hits something else. That said, if it hits this thingie over here, if anything does, then I need to draw a circle around the intersect, later, join such intersection points in some way and so on.

That's what feels right to me anyway, but my point is, there are pretty much an endless number of things that can drawn onto some paper. Without a few rules to reduce the number of choices, it's really difficult to decide what to do next. In fact, I will sometimes further reduce them by adding additonal constraints, or in some cases, I will mix things up by doing something crazy like draw a big circle over here and now must come up with a way that feels right in which that circle can be incorporated without having to break too many rules, and occasionally, a new style develops out of that. 

But if I sat there and was like shit, I could start anywhere, and literally do anything within this paper rectangle, fuck. I wouldn't even know how to start. One time I would use the ink that bled through the page to help define the set of constraints for the next sheet. Then I would do it again. But I'd have not done anything if the choices were infinite and equal and all of that. 

""stream of consciousness"" writing is a good way not to make art necessarily, or to publish, unless you want to, but to get past writer's block.

If I want to do it, it would be done by then. But I'm not ""Wasting time"". On the contrary. My time is priceless and the most time I get to do what I want the better. Still, others don't agree with me so much on price, and so in order to afford shit, I still have to do shit I wouldn't want to do for any other reason. But I'm lazy and I'm going to wait until I absolutely have to. In the mean time, because I want to do the least amount of actual work, I will be thinking about how to do that. When I finally sit down to do it, I've worked out a pretty good plan for doing it as easily and quickly as I can. I'm sure some might not agree with my methods, but you asked me to do it by X, I did it by X, so don't give me shit for spending 95% of the time doing something else, and thinking about how to make it take 5% of the time you gave me.

MY point was that, despite this, if we had ethical leaders, it would be paramount to maintain as much of this ethos as possible, so as to not cause an inequity of justice and opportunity. 

David was not god. They were not a cult. He had no intention of leading them into suicide or anything of that nature. He considered himself a prophet, and the people followed him out of choice. He did not, nor ever forced anyone to stay or follow. 

A bit like how in BDSM, there is something called consensual non-consent. Obviously it's not legal as in you can't use it as a legal argument (it is legal to do, so long as you both really are consenting and nobody is getting hurt like they don't want to be), but there are people that seek to make a choice to give up their ability to freely choose in the future. The government doesn't give a shit what a bunch of LARPers do on the internet, or even in real life, for the most part. 

The Branch Dividians were a kind of LARP in this way, with David at the center. People wanted to follow him, and freely chose to give up what was necessary to do it. 

The thing was, David's prophesies were being made true as the government began to descend down upon them and enter into the siege. Besides from just killing people indiscriminately for doing what they chose to do on their land, things that were not abuse, and not worthy of being given a death sentence, besides that part, the biggest mistake the government made was just doing it Leroy Jenkins style. They had fucking people on the inside that knew, and were close to David. They made the government aware of all of this information. Despite all of that, they still thought it was a good idea to basically make a bunch of LARPers into true honest to goodness believers by using his prophesy as a fucking script in how to approach. 

What was their crimes anyway? 

The worst thing they could be accused of, and I don't know if it's true or not, but it is with many groups like this, is they don't pay taxes. The thing is, we have a whole procedure for how to handle that. They say they wanted to serve a warrant.

Imagine if the Branch Dividians in Waco had also Tanks and helicopters and and endless supply of generated electricity, support for keeping supply lines,and on and on. Well, those hippies that didn't hurt anyone would still be having fights over jealousy with who gets to sleep with David, and the kids would be alive, happy, well fed, educated, like they were every single time CPS showed up unannounced, but were let in to look around and observe as long as they wanted, each time determining no abuse. The local Sharaff would still occasionally see old David on one of his runs into town where he never hid from anyone or forced anyone to do anything or stay against their will, and he happily would chat up the locals and invite them by, including local law enforcement, which was notorious in the area for normally hating alt lifestyle nutters. 

Turns out the government at some point decided if it wanted to fuck us, we shouldn't be allowed to have the tools to stand a chance at fighting back.

Guns were one of the most advanced machines anyone would own at one time in history. I guess because all throughout history, people be trying to ""come and take it"". Then this country sprang up with the notion that the government should be unable to just ""come and take it"". It wasn't long before the government decided to get rid of the ""don't be evil"" clause in their constitution.

I am child free and I am 100% in favor of abortion. I am deeply empathetic to the point of crisis sometimes, but it is due to the suffering of people. Consciousness is something special. It's possible Dolphins, large whales, and Elephants have it. But then again, they have never really made the effort to communicate like we do. We have made many efforts to bridge those gaps, but it's a one sided effort. It's a form of domestication, not communication. If anything on earth understood it awareness as we do, they would come to us willing to learn, communicate more than basic urges, advance their culture. 

At least some of us understand that consciousness, awareness, in the way we have it, it so far and beyond anything else on earth, that there is a level of empathy I am willing to give, say a dog, but if that dog attacked my dad (68), I'd fucking kill it and be like well fuck, now I have no dog and a body to get rid of. I'd fondly look back on times when me and the dog did cool stuff and I could see he was happy, but if you deserve the empathy that I reserve for people, you need to be able to understand why an unprovoked, possibly deadly attack on my family member that merely had the nerve to come over and have a beer, you need to be more aware than IF THEN ELSE. People too. Many carry out their lives with IF THEN ELSE, and never stop to actually consider they are a living, thinking, thing. Perhaps awareness on that level is rare. 

So empathy towards the conscious and aware, the world can't get enough. This world was built by and for the sociopath. I consider people that compare my awareness, my consciousness, and the specialty of it, to that of a *cow* to be people I am not going to take a serious health and lifestyle choice advice from.

Back on topic, I learned from my GF, and understand that it is possible to feel something, although the feeling is not due to something rational. That does not make the feeling irrational. In fact, it is as real as any other, and somtimes the dissonance can make it worse because you know you know something isn't right, and yet, you feel a certain way. The feeling is real. Now, I can't count how many times I have heard on reddit ""feels don't real"". As if that is all that needs to be said. It's bad enough it's near impossible to *express* a feeling without someone trying to fix it. It's a lament. I know how to fix it. I know what's wrong. I may dislike what must be done to change it, or there may be reasons why the generally obvious approach will make something else worse that matters to me. And if it was about a bunch of bullshit, the feelings are real. 

I look at that as a lesson in an overall lack of imagination i see in people. It's not hard to imagine feeling some way that wasn't robotic.

schizophrenia,fp6yvwk,t1_fp6nlxb,1588361013.0,"if it has not already happened, you will reach the point where despite everything, waking up neurotypical, the idea of it, becomes a scary thought. I'm not glorifying mental illness. I'm glorifying the self. You cannot have a serious mental illness without it leaving it's mark on you, so that in your efforts to cope and to understand, perhaps also to forget, you become the self that you are, which includes your mental illness. It doesn't define you, but you wouldn't be yourself without it. How did you get here? Is ethical to say you're broken? To ""fix"" you would mean to lose yourself and become someone else. There is, of course, better living through chemistry, and I endorse this fully, but I have reached the point where in the event I was even still myself, where enough thread remained to connect the eras, to provide remembrance, if I knew the ""fix"" was to no longer be myself, I would regret ever wanting it. I used to be scared, and now I am not, damaged maybe, but me, myself, and I. For sure, I know that at least I am alive. The things I was scared of have been a part of my life long enough to have left their mark. Take them from me, and you cut away something I have accepted and embraced, come to terms with, and then grew to count on as a reminder that I have an opportunity to see things from a place that is not where most people get to stand. If I woke up, and it was gone, I'd panic and suffer as I did when it all started. That's what this is all about. we define mental illness by the negative effect it has on our lives, but our purpose in life is determined by the people that erected a brutal and dysfunctional society. It's a jarring change, and we are not given the opportunity and time to acclimate to it before we are told that it is dragging on our usefulness to the sociopaths that run all this shit. They don't seek to ease your pain, they seek to restore your ability to generate shareholder value, and if unable to do that, they seek to ensure you drag as little as possible. 

And yet, my purpose was never to generate shareholder value, and most of my problems stem from trying to exist as I am. I am not broken, I am alive, and it's quite insulting to imagine anyone thinking I am faulty because it simply hurts to pretend everything is OK with the world. The perception of the world around you and where you fit into it spins around the axis of self love and acceptance. Grow up in a society that believes that helping you is breaking you down to almost nothing in order to make you back up as someone else. I am actually quite good at many things. There is more than enough I can do to aid a society that values people and earn my keep. In fact, although I haven't experienced it, intuitively it feels like the right way to treat a large number of mental illnesses, even serious ones. 

By now, it should be entirely obvious why people don't take their meds. They are not themselves on their meds, but they want to be. A society built by loving and empathetic people would offer both medicine and a way to preserve the most important parts of themselves, and find a place within the world that is a comfort to them, as it's a big world, with so many things to do and to be done. A sociopath does not understand the value of the self. They disregard it as a drag on their performance, and at least in this world, disregarding the self, and adopting an obsessive and mechanical drive towards the goals defined by sociopaths throughout history, is one of the best indicators we have that they will succeed in business, finance, politics, an in fact, there are more confirmed sociopaths as a ratio of the number of mid and high cap CEOs than any other professional title. Who the fuck makes billions of dollars and keeps working? It turns out, that subtracting people that inherited the money, pretty much all of them. 

Who gets locked up as broken, requiring treatment to fit a definition based on your usefulness to said billionaires? Are you broken, or did you become different faster than you could process at the time? If you woke up without your illness tomorrow, how would you *really* feel, if it was possible to still have the intense feelings and thoughts that you can have right now? What would help you more, becoming an entirely different person to become a better servant, or for the world to open up and embrace you, for surely if you have experienced pain and loss, you understand love and beauty- things we give lipservice to as being part of the human condition, but the evidence makes it seem pretty rare."

ShrugLifeSyndicate,fp5g1pj,t3_gb7yn3,1588328041.0,"Time is a bit like a medium. Energy exists as the thing in which allows for the working of time into whatever happened. There is a process in creating something, and in creating anything, even if you skip a step, you did not skip time. If all that we know was a chess board, there are rules in place that place a limit on the least number of moves it takes to get a knight from one square to another on the board. But it's not a solo game. The game doesn't have to be one with infinite limits when the fundamental limits are set so that assuming the opposing players are giving it their best shot, you aren't getting your knight over there in the theoretical minimum number of moves. 

This is why algebra was insufficient as we grew to understand more about the universe and it's players. It only takes 3 three players interacting with each other in this game before the best we can do is running algorithms to give us the likely next move, at which time, we must observe and do it all over again, and again. We cannot say with a certainty what will happen in a year. We can give a statistical likelihood to the next moment based on the position of the all the pieces on the board we can observe. 

The thing to remember is that the game is being played even when we aren't looking at it, but until we look at it, it's as though the pieces could be anywhere it is possible for them to be. When we look at it, because the pieces could have arrived where they are any number of ways, we can't use our observation of the positions to determine what's going to happen next. We can sit back and watch the game being played, though. The medium of time is such that the true artwork is in watching the artist at work and marveling at how the art develops, or how the game progresses. That's one of our gifts. We get to be in the audience. The other being that we may also work this medium, in a limited capacity. We can zig instead of zag if we want to. And it will always be so. If we wanted to communicate with what lies beyond this universe, we should consider the one thing we can leave behind for them, and that is in our conscious ability to direct some of the energy that exists to power the potter's wheel, overcome inertia, and leave behind something in the clay that wasn't ever going to otherwise be. ""We were here"". Not every move we make will be the most efficient, or best, but it leaves a board with a unique layout that now and forever, affects the way the game is played until it's over. Kind of cool how much power we have, all things considered. It is said that we were created in god's image. Any one of you fucks can change the universe forever, whenever.
-------------
We may only know what happened. That is the cost of living here. There is nothing we can define as living if we knew tomorrow like we remember yesterday. No marvel, no wonder, no desire, no excitement, no love, all of that which gives us a life to live, is because of a sacrifice that was made that freed us from the having to do whatever was the most logical next move forever. We were not freed from the basic rules that define how the pieces move around, but from the commandments that forced us into what to do next. We are encouraged to play the game in our own way. That said, holding positions denies them to other players, and control of the board was thus discouraged. It is important to be a good sport, with a desire for other players to have a chance to be where you been, otherwise you are taking life from them, you denying them a chance at placing their own etchings onto time, and who the fuck do you think you are? The sacrifice that allowed for your life wasn't made just for you. Generally, how people act is based on whether or not they understand that."

schizophrenia,fp5dvp4,t1_fp4zf24,1588325703.0,"I used isolation as a coping method because it was the best one available to me. Almost 40 years old, and I can tell you that if you rely on isolation, it is going to mean that you will miss out on life, you will hurt people you love, and to show for it, depending on what you tend to do while you isolate, you might be wasting money, doing harmful drugs, or compulsively masturbating, I don't know, but bad habits are hard to break. Every relationship you have will suffer. I'm not saying I know a better way. After long enough, we stick to, and build on the coping methods that work, and if it's isolation, then it's going to become a, essential part of your life that others must accept, and few will. 

I am absolutely sure there are other, better ways. Don't wait until you are 40 to seek them out and try to learn them. Seek them out now and put the same effort into them as you have isolation. A long time ago, I was not happy to be lonely, like most 16 year old boys, if I didn't have a partner, I longed for one. But I would enter into relationships and almost immediately begin to check out. The call of the void became very much a scream. It wasn't long, maybe 19 or 20 years old, where what I wanted was to be left alone. Why? Freedom to cope in the harmful ways I knew worked, but others that grew to care about me, of course, could not stand by and just watch without wanting to lend their aid. People that loved me may not have understood what I was doing, nor that it may have been the most effective thing I knew, but they did see a guy being self destructive, and it hurt them to be made to stand idle until I was done. That is why I pushed people away. I was, and still am, extremely selfish. I am honest about it now, that is the biggest difference, but it doesn't make it any easier to maintain a relationship. You probably know as well as I do that there comes a point towards the end of a period of isolation where you desperately want that human contact, love, affection, all those needs that you have, and that you, while not thinking clearly, certainly push those away as you certainly push away those seeking to help you find another way to cope. 

My GF is an amazing person. I'm not schizophrenic, but I share some of the symptoms. I find that a lot of mental health disorders have threads in common with one another, and one major thread is that it smacks us in the face so hard at first, that it's almost instinct to isolate from the world. For one, we have to accept the reality of this thing, and two, we have to consider now the impact it will have on others. There is always a lot to come to terms with, and we can't do it out there in the noise- that is the perception we have. That isolation is the safest for all involved. It's simply all we know at the time. Had we known better, perhaps it would have been a different story. 

There is always time to make changes, but everything has inertia. It would have been easier to change 20 years ago before the velocity of my life, combined with the increased mass of adult responsibilities, caused it all to build momentum, and therefore the inertia will certainly make changing very difficult, and any change will take longer to reach a goal. 

No matter what anyone tells you, it is not possible to change overnight. Without a realistic expectation, you will only make matters worse by providing yourself endless opportunities to fail, and therefore, excuses to keep moving in whatever direction you are going.  

I'm not sure this was the best place to write this, but whatever. I can feel that desire coming on, and by monday I am going to feel like absolute shit, so here or anywhere, I am at least having the recognition that I am on the edge of another episode of isolation, and at least I have a chance to curve it a bit so it's not as bad as last time."

Need a place to live? Everyone does! It should not require going into debt for basic shelter. Debt should not be required for healthcare and education, food, water, electricity, communication, and so on. Basically, debt should be used only to go beyond the basic requirements for life. Debt for a PS5? sure. Debt for a basic smart phone, a modern requirement? no."

ShrugLifeSyndicate,fozz112,t3_ga0lax,1588199418.0,"If you look around, it appears that this society that we have constructed was not meant for loving people. Conclusion: most people lack something that we have assumed to be a fundamental part of the human condition. It's probably a much larger conversion on why we have simply assumed for thousands of years, pretty much anyone that isn't braindead or something is fully conscious. I find that to be a better mark of the human condition, hubris and audacity. So it is that success, as measured by the children of the society that created and defined the word success, this society I was born into, is a word withheld due out of hostility towards those that, not only wish *not* to accept the abject suffering and the quantity of all those that also know it, but understand that it doesn't have to be this way. There is enough wealth and resources for us all to live pretty good lives. Sure we would still have to work, but it wouldn't be slavery, and it wouldn't become our purpose in life, unless we choose a worthy contribution, one that we are proud to be our purpose. Or nothing. Because there is enough for a strong social welfare system that would be enough to sustain life without it being a depressing existence. 

It's a generally hostile place to people that want to love unconditionally as much as they are able to. It rewards evil. At the very least, it rewards an absence of the things we were brought up to believe are essential to the human condition, With wealth, power, golden parachutes, and good physical health. 

Having said that, love is real. It's the realist thing there is. To express it, to feel it, to understand it, to see it in others. This was, to me, a communication of pure love and happiness, and in between the two opposing worlds where the space appears barren, is full of universe and dreams, the things that unites us all and gives us life, and for those that are able to feel it, love and happiness. I can't explain it, but I get it. 

Only god understands the infinite, we understand the finite, and in between all of that, is a desire to share, which we do out of love. Without that, we wouldn't exist as conscious beings. The apes made it here, too, from our common ancestor, but some pressure was place upon us that required us to love each other to survive, and love requires a higher knowledge. Threat response won't get you through times when, without your neighbors, you lack the strength on your own. Something made it important to teach the next generation, and without the understanding they they are still here when you are gone, and it's desired for them to suffer less than you, why would you waste the energy?

Also, these flowers point towards the sun, the source of their energy. We are all stars. 

(and, dude, if you didn't mean that as on purpose, after what we talked about, having it point towards me, then I am falling into a synchronicity slipstream)"
