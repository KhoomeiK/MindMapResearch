depression,fq5arnl,t3_g9ndgw,1589098353.0,Yes. My time stopped when I was 17. I do nothing but look back at the memories from then. Life is just much worse now and I do nothing but blame myself and repeat the same mistakes.

Invisalign,fo9bbf5,t1_fo8qeo5,1587614984.0,I messaged him again and he told me to change to my fourth tray even though I'm behind schedule ðŸ˜” and to just use the chewies. I'm confused cos I thought switching trays early is heavily advised against :/

ADHD,fndnhon,t3_g0zlx6,1586873864.0,My university has moved their studies online and ever since then I've lost the ability to recall how many days have past or even tell what day it is without my phone lol. It definitely feels like a week can go by in a flash when I'm doing nothing productive but browse the internet.
