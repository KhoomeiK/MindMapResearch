Anxiety,fmc5zc3,t3_fu4pox,1585939538.0,"Hello , I know exactly how you feel. I actually started filming vlogs on how I was going to get better then this whole thing happened. I had to cancel my appointments to see the doctor in which I was hoping that they would refer me to a therapist but I’m isolating myself and had to cancel my appointments. I developed a slight cough even though I’m through I am isolating but some people that i live with aren’t isolating. My thoughts are spiraling."

Hello,

I would ignore his scream (Don't give him attention when he is screaming) That includes talking to him and then just go to your room if you can. you can also go to the bathroom and turn on the ventilator to block some noise and listen to music. Hope this helps."
