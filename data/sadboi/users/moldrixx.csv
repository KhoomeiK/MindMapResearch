I have been diagnosed with BPD just over a year ago. I truly felt like I had a grip on it. At my worst moments I was horrific to be around but with therapy i thought I had become more and to suppress it. 

I am going through a rough patch mentally so it's very likely that I've lost the grip I thought I had.

Am I okay to ask you to take a look at something though? One of my posts in r/advice. The person commenting back to be was the one who called me a narc and but has also called multiple people narcs.

JustNoSO,fqb0u7f,t1_fqazbkm,1589228611.0,"Yes we have an agreement. At the start of all of this we were both lucky to work from home. I since lost my job. We are able to go into each others space but because of how I've been feeling I've stuck to my space. And he is a very active person who is up early, does exercise, does a little bit of freelance work and then games with his friends. It was a mutual and healthy agreement especially because he is high risk and wouldn't go outside so he has the space to do whatever he feels like to not feel couped up. I on the other hand can go outside. 

The non speaking is the issue. I will hold my hands up and say that due to how I have been, I have been very tired and sleepy. But when I am awake I will go and see what he's doing, ask if he's okay and everything. I get the responses when I push for them but he doesn't really do the same. It could be that I miss him when I'm asleep. But whenever I check on him and he's fallen asleep I leave a message. 

The relationship was healthier when we could go outside and not be crammed down each others throats. I have since lost pretty much everything and have a lot of time for worry. 

I read another comment and I think I may have been underestimating the emotional toll my depression is having on him aswell. I guess I just pictured my in my own bubble but its more of emitting the depression around the house."
JustNoSO,fqazq0g,t1_fq9jajm,1589228070.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience, it has helped me see it in a different way. I think I will apologise to him for not appreciating the scale of how it affects him aswell. 

He has safety proofed the house which has been a big weight off my shoulders but in terms of communication there is none. He has not spoken to me properly for about a week. I left to go to my mum's for her help and whilst I was there I received no responses. When I got back I just get words. I have to initiate contact. I don't want him to feel he needs to be with me 24/7 but just a simply ""hey you okay?"" Over text would help imo."
JustNoSO,fqaz5y7,t1_fqay511,1589227796.0,"Because we've been locked in together we kind of have an arrangement where I'll occupy one room and he'll have another so we're not really in each others spaces that often. 

I don't think I want him in my space any more than what we have nor do I want him to have to feel like he needs to stop what's he doing to check on me. But he literally has gone 4 days with saying only words to me not even a full sentence. I had even gone to my Mum's for a few days to spend time in a different setting and the whole time I was there he didn't talk to me. So I guess I just want some kind of reassurance that he actually cares. I'm not asking for a big grand gesture from him, just a ""hey, are you okay?"" Even by text. 

When I was 18 I was very dependent on an ex for emotional help so with my current partner I've always tried to make sure that he is not responsible for my happiness. But I definitely understand the toll it can take on him aswell. 

I am in contact with my therapist and I am on prescribed medication. I'm also trying to set little goals for myself just to feel like I'm doing something.

After some therapy we decided that my BPD was most likely triggered by my childhood. I wanted to do my own research and came across some disgusting things being said about BPD. It honestly set me back. I will admit that at the time my BPD was at its worse, not made better by an abusive partner and family members I was horrific. Now that I've got a better grip on it I don't feel as ashamed. My mental illness could have presented itself in many ways, but because it chose BPD I should be ostracized from certain groups and people?

When I was getting to know my partner I told him and encouraged a little bit of research on his end to see what he could be potentially getting into.

Whenever you're ready and safe, send him a message saying that you're fine with the relationship and that any further messages from him you will consider harassment. That way if he does contact you, which he will, you can take it to the police.

Block him on social media so that he is not able to guilt you. Maybe collect some proof of his drug use to turn in to the police, or just as a threat to keep him away. In terms of all the other things he has done to you, you can persue it or you can let it go, but please open up to your counsellor. They will be able to provide support. I know it's difficult.

I cant tell you how validating it is to have seen your post today.

I hope you're keeping safe and well"

An action occured -

I played with the Gameboy, I broke it - OP posted about their sister.

A reaction occured -

My brother got angry, I felt bad - Sister received backlash, OP felt bad.

So the solution - 

Apologise."

Next month, let her rifle through the mail. Get a camera if possible.

Call the police and say someone has stolen your important mail.

Let the rest take care of itself.

Sorry you've got an asshat of a Mum. I know how it feels.

Also number 3 will always stand. As stated, regardless of intention she caused an issue, accident or not, apologise for it. She said she feels guilty about the backlash, so apologise. 

Lol it's not difficult"
AmItheAsshole,fnqzpxn,t1_fnqy9vt,1587175842.0,"1. She didn't manipulate your grandma.

2. I understand your fashion page highlights what the model is wearing. But your intention behind posting it, after she just snagged $800-1000 from right under your nose was to be petty.

3. She has a right to be mad at you. Regardless of whether you say you did it in purpose or not, you still caused her a lot of bother. You still have to apologise for your accidents."

Provided that the place you are driving to is a shorter time than the time you plan to be outside exercising at the place for.

You're also allowed to go to your friends home to cool off after arguments in your isolation home.

I've done the legwork for you. Please find attached 4 links. 3 for newspaper links confining the information. Not including the sun as we all know they're a bunch of lying asshats.

You can't have a 'professional' sit there and help you understand your thoughts and feelings if they're going to try and interject their own. It will not benefit you.

Small effort now = big pay off later.

Hope you are safe and well. Good luck"
AmItheAsshole,fnqeeel,t1_fnqe7gu,1587162972.0,Optometrists would have been better than eye dentist. But they chose what they were comfortable with and knew at the time. Hardly makes them an asshole.
