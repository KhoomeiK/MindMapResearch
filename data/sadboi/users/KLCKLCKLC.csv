Cringetopia,fps15zn,t1_fpryob3,1588865740.0,"I was probably considered an “outsider” growing up and I was miserable. I wasn’t quite as out there as this individual, but close, and I did not have many friends for it. My parents didn’t understand me or agree with my interests but they also didn’t ridicule me for my quirks. Rather they helped me understand and realize that I could be the person I was and like the things I liked while still being a respectable member of society. I hope the person in this photos parents will do the same for this individual so they can have a happy well-rounded life experience. But Im assuming it isn’t a full blown mental issue here, rather a case of a young person seeking an identity or a sense of belonging somewhere. You stand by your point and I can respect that. Cheers."
Cringetopia,fprxz7s,t1_fprwvsc,1588864145.0,"I understand where you’re coming from. But I would consider giving benefit of the doubt that OP would handle their own child’s issues differently and the likeliness of their child ever knowing they posted this are very slim. Not trying to argue your point, just saying things aren’t always quite that black and white."
Cringetopia,fprwlsv,t1_fprw5hg,1588863431.0,"All good points and I agree, I guess my main focus was that the person who posted it shouldn’t be deemed an unfit parent because they said don’t want this kind of life for their child. Posting it on a cringe subreddit is its own issue I suppose but here we all are"
Cringetopia,fprucb8,t1_fprbdba,1588862198.0,"There is a difference between being genuinely cruel and not wanting your own child to end up this way. It’s no way to live. This person in the photo could have a mental illness, but if so, it’s clearly running rampant and being enabled. You think they’re happy? No. If this was my kid it would break my heart. They would be bullied and made to be miserable, that’s just the way it is. What’s the alternative? Normalize the belief that they are a wild animal of the opposite gender so eventually 10 years later people don’t make fun of people for it? The damage is done. I wouldn’t disown or ridicule my child for this but I would definitely be trying to help them find their true character and personality because this isn’t one. And it could also simply stem from lack of discipline, might not even be mental illness, the internet is a bad place for young people to be on. I wonder if this person didn’t have unmonitored internet access they wouldn’t have been exposed to the concept of being a transgendered wolf at all. I doubt that was an organic thought, it was probably influenced by all the weird shit you and I see on the internet every day. Shit not meant for a child’s eyes. And before you call me transphobic, let me emphasize the wolf part. That’s the part I’m saying people are, without a doubt, not going to accept. Wanting your child to have a shot at a quality of life beyond being isolated and generally misunderstood for shit like this IS loving them."

todayilearned,fpql563,t1_fpnx4yo,1588825377.0,"I guess to me it’s funny because it shows how the internet shits on everything, not a single person took the contest seriously and all people contributed were hitler jokes, grandma sex jokes, and then Sierra Mist which among the other two obviously could not have actually been used for an actual name so it’s like a big fat middle finger lol"

It’s my most reliable method of coming off of a panic, but when it doesn’t work, I feel pretty hopeless. I also do journal frequently and find it can organize my thoughts and make them much more manageable. I am not sure if my doctor would prescribe Ativan, but it’s definitely something I’ll ask about if my state continues to worsen. Thank you for your time and plentiful advice, you are a very kind soul and you should know that people like you make these things easier to handle for others. I hope you yourself are doing well!"

benzodiazepines,fpa17bb,t3_g92dun,1588438744.0,I’m getting on buspar taking it for the first time tonight. Have you seen any positive or negative results? I can’t be prescribed benzos because it’s an online health practitioner and they can’t do anything like Xanax which I know helps me cause I’ve used it from friends when I have a panic attack. So it’s really my only option for right now. So I’m hoping it helps.

I 100% agree...I’ve always felt that way but if you actually pointed that observation out to someone who you think is virtue signaling, chances are they wouldn’t consider it for even a second before calling you a bigot or accusing you of being ignorant and insensitive to other cultures. Which is ironic because in most cases people are mimicking an aspect of a different culture because they really admire it. Not always. But most the time."

Marijuana,fp434yd,t3_gb4gfn,1588290753.0,"I think you’re right to assume it had something to do with your pre existing mental state, but definitely accredit the amount of thc as well as the fact that edibles take foreeeever to taper down which, when you’re high as all hell and thinking things like “am I broken? Am I going to feel like this forever?” they can really mess with your head. I love edibles but I don’t ever trust one first time I meet one now cause I’ve had this happen a few times too. I can remember once I was holding my face, shaking and telling my boyfriend “I got too high!” Over and over again until I eventually ate his entire salad with tears in my eyes. It was a really good salad. If I had been alone or my boyfriend didn’t like weed or me talking about it, I would have had a bad freak out for sure. I think all the pieces were there for you to freak out this time unfortunately. It sucks, maybe it’s your mind trying to tell you that you needed to take a minute to clear out the negative emotions you were going through."

depression,fekk0n2,t1_fe617hd,1579201659.0,"You hit the nail on the head and articulated it so well. One of the first things I told my boyfriend when we got serious was “I have these issues I deal with but I will never use them as a crutch to hurt you or behave poorly.” It resonated with him big time, and helps him understand what I’m dealing with isn’t quite yet in my control"
depression,fekjqu8,t3_enrs4c,1579201495.0,"I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, but I’m also relieved I’m not the only one. I’ve told my boyfriend I feel this way about my problems and he is shocked, because he can clearly tell me when my behavior is not healthy and that it’s coming from mental illness but I always tell myself I’m just lazy, self-absorbed, neurotic and controlling and weak, but deep down I know those are all just the splinters of my depression and most definitely anxiety and panic. It’s hard because these things make us feel worthless so trying to convince yourself that you shouldn’t discredit these problems is tricky. I already don’t like or trust myself to know what’s best. So why would I believe myself when I try to commit to the thought that I am fighting something I can’t always control let alone talk to someone about it. I just shoo it away and will casually dismantle my entire problem and write it off as being stupid or incapable of just being a normal happy person. I tried to talk to a friend last night about it and literally just froze up, backed out of explaining how I was feeling and blurted out loud, at a bar “I just hate myself haha.” And she deals with these things too but she was shocked to hear it. I was horrified. It led to me going home and sinking very deep into the same old shame hole. I always embarrass myself, and talking about mental health can be so hard and makes you so vulnerable, so of course that’s going to make you uncomfortable, and then you worry people will think you’re crazy and you’ll lose any credibility.  I’m sorry, I know it sucks."
