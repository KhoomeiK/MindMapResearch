The guy told me that since I didn't have amnesia (which I do, just not black-and-white ""how did I get here"" amnesia, because I am or someone is often co-con) I didn't meet the criteria. I tried to tell him, if he looks at the NEWEST DSM (DSM-V I believe), he would find that OSDD-1b is a thing, and it doesn't require amnesia. He didn't believe me. Pure laziness and ignorance. I was disappointed to say the least. Spent hours of testing and tons of my father's money only to be invalidated once again. This was my second time trying to get diagnosed. Sigh."
