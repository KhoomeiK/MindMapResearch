It's a very long story but to put it short: Some people hid the information from me about one person having a girlfriend. On purpose. And lied about it 1st.
My guess is that this is some sort of self-defense. As they hate me. They most likely think that I'd be jealous.

But I still don't understand why they've put themselves in this position of lying about this and hiding this information. It's not a kind of lie that go away. You have to constantly hide it. 
It might seem like not a big deal to some people. But it actually is. They'd have to keep on hiding this, over and over again.
