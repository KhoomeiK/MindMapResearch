Empaths,firsk2o,t3_f9gyth,1582670470.0,"You're not alone, I completely get where you're coming from. I have such a strong need where I feel like I always need to be able to support/help the people I care about to the point that I used to struggle so badly when I tried to help and couldn't, even though sometimes you just can't help everyone. I also feel like whenever someone I love shows me something they care about, I need to be engaged in it and understand what makes them love it and add music they show me to my music library even if I'm not a huge fan of it... just because they love it and I love them. and I have longed for that level of dedication to things I love from people for as long as I can remember, but I think most people just don't operate that way. not that the people I am close with don't care at all about what I have to show them or what I care about, but sometimes it feels like I care waaaay too much in comparison to most."
nonmonogamy,fclk8o2,t3_ehpyls,1577749736.0,"honestly, if I was interested in the person and I thought that we could build something I would probably respond again but I would ask about why they disappeared/weren't really very responsive to begin with. you can never know if maybe someone was going through a rough time in their life, thought they might have time/energy for a new relationship but did not, and then wanted to try again after some time has passed/maybe they are in a better spot. but I wouldn't want to get involved with someone that this would continue to happen with. but I would give them a chance to explain what happened and if they were willing to talk about that and were better about it after that I'd still give them another chance. course my rule is if something that was an issue happens more than once then I'm done. so if you gave her another shot and then she ghosted you again, I'd say not to respond again if she ever tried to come back after that."
polyadvice,fap3k8j,t3_ea99af,1576278990.0,this honestly looks super great and I currently don't have time to sign up right now but I definitely plan to! and I'll let you know how I like it or if I see anything that might need changing. I am also a web designer so I know how it is building something like this and being worried about releasing it to the public if there's anything you missed or screwed up!
BPD,fac3dth,t3_e8chmg,1575932914.0,"I do not have BPD but my best friend does and I've seen this cycle with her a lot. The one thing that I've seen be the biggest struggle with that is that when she gets motivated she is MOTIVATED and is ready to do EVERYTHING. but not even a completely mentally stable person can tackle all the things that they want to work on in their life at once. I feel like maybe she feels motivated so rarely that when she does she just wants to tackle all of her issues in her life and fix them all at once... but that never works out well and is able to last. Times I HAVE seen her succeed is when she takes a step back from that excited high of motivation and decides to focus on just ONE thing at a time. takes one thing she wants to improve and actually sits down and makes a plan of how she's going to improve it. for example, if you choose to work on  exercising, take the time when you are motivated to write down a specific process of how you want to work on that one specific thing. like ""do this certain work out every other day"" and then have a way for yourself to check off the days that you do it. that way when the motivation starts to fall, if you can just bring yourself to spend 30 min every other day doing something it doesn't feel so impossible to do, even if you aren't feeling great. This has at least been helpful for my best friend."

BPD,f9ndsbt,t1_f9lzegs,1575482438.0,"Aww thanks, that’s nice of you to say :) but yes, I totally agree with you. The BPD is not the reason anyone who has it cares so deeply. I’ve had a lot of experience with my closest friend having BPD (even though we didn’t realize that’s what it was until very recently) and as many struggles as she has and no matter how unhappy she is a lot of the times, she’s still the best friend I’ve ever had because of how much she cares. She’s the most loving person I’ve ever met, and I don’t think that is caused by the BPD at all, I think BPD is there because she is such a caring person and it’s led her to so much hurt and disappointment. 

BPD sucks and I’m happy that I didn’t end up with it even though I truly think if things in my childhood took a different route I could have... but I value how much love you guys have so much. It’s rare and no one here should discount that as an incredible quality that most people do not have. I’ve wished for a long time I could take away the pain from people that comes with that a lot of the times, but you’re all unicorns in my opinion :)"
NoStupidQuestions,f9l1wfd,t3_e5mvhs,1575412568.0,You’re definitely not alone. I don’t even have all the responsibilities you do but can barely have the motivation to go grocery shopping for myself after working all day and knowing I have to come back the next day.
BPD,f9kvmr2,t3_e5jpda,1575408776.0,"This is actually an interesting post. I have never considered myself someone who has BPD but my best friend has it, and she struggles with all of it - the depression and anxiety too... but theres one thing we always have related on which is the fact that we both have WAY stronger emotions than most people do. we didn't understand why we both had this but it caused her so much pain and didn't for me... but then she got a BPD book and read about how most people aren't BORN with BPD but just born with extra emotions, and having those extra emotions can turn into BPD dependent on what things you go through as you grow up. so to me I feel like I don't have BPD but I can strongly relate to the overpowering emotions and I think it'd be really something if everyone was like that."
nonmonogamy,f9k4l34,t1_f9k3n8h,1575392685.0,"It might sound harsh, but honestly love is not everything. I dated someone through part of high school and for years after high school (total 8 year relationship) and was even engaged to him but he was horrible to me and when things finally ended I thought I'd never find someone I loved like that again. let me tell you I was 100% wrong. you're young, life changes a lot and you WILL find someone who treats you so much better than this."
nonmonogamy,f9k2714,t1_f9k1exz,1575391178.0,"Honestly, this is going to be a hard thing to ""fix."" you need to demand more power, demand that if he wants to look at your phone you get to look at his. and in my personal opinion I think you should also demand that if he's seeing other people you should be able to as well. its one thing if you don't WANT to, but it sounds like he also wouldn't allow it even if you DID. It's okay for there to be an open-relationship where only one person is open, but really only if they would be fully supportive of the other person being with other people too if they wanted to. I honestly don't think this is a relationship you should be trying to fix and you should be getting out of it."
nonmonogamy,f9k13io,t3_e5iizm,1575390478.0,This doesn't sound like a relationship you should be in at all. You might be okay with him sleeping with other people when you cannot... but the fact that you are not ALLOWED to even if you wanted to is just a sign that he is acting as if he owns you. And then on top of that he looks through your phone and won't let you even glance at his? the power-balance in this relationship is ridiculous and he is controlling everything. I would get out of this ASAP.
AmItheAsshole,f2ybwx3,t3_dejq34,1570488856.0,"Gonna have to go with YTA.

maybe she takes more personal days than someone should, but you don't know whats going on in her personal life or how she handles it. Yes everyone has shit going on and still goes to work, but some people struggle with mental illnesses or just have a harder time dealing with things and its not right to just decide those types of people deserve less because they can't handle things and come to work like a normal person. coming to work every single day is sometimes just a lot harder for some people to do than others.

honestly I hate how the system works and think that everyone is treated like machines that can just handle working 40 hours every single week, and its not easy to do that especially when you're struggling with things. 

just going to say if my cat died and I had no days left from my job to take off and they told me that I might be fired if I took off I'd tell them ""oh well I'm depressed as fuck and can't come in."" my relationship with my cat is more important than my job. its cruel that you did not give your employee a chance to grieve her dog, especially when you know she was telling you the truth."
AmItheAsshole,f2yae18,t3_deglhq,1570488132.0,"NTA!!  
this is something that would help your daughter so much! not only with her ballet career but also her life in general. I am not even as large as her, but I am a DD and it has even caused me some shoulder/back issues as I get older. it would be a totally different story if you were pushing her into do this and she wasn't sure, but she clearly wants this and with what she wants to do with her life it is pretty clear she will not regret it and it is HER CHOICE. making her wait till she's 18 and can make the decision without your permission just causes possible issues with the career she wants to do and with how sure she is it sounds like she'll do it when she turns 18 anyway. might as well let her do it now and have a better chance at doing what she wants in ballet."
family,f2y8b0t,t3_delnhq,1570487401.0,"yup, definitely understand this. actually took me a long time to really realize that I shouldn't just decide that I should have kids based on this biological need/want for them. still hope to have kids someday and still feel this often, but definitely won't let myself give into this desire unless I get to a point in life where I can fully support a child or children. but definitely understand this feeling and it sucks because I kinda wish I could just not biologically want a child, because we don't need more humans in this world and its just a lot of work to raise one."
css,f2y51xa,t3_dd4i19,1570486259.0,"I often will use :before on a list. so if I have a list in my content and say I want to use check marks instead of the dots that a list has by default, instead of adding a check mark icon in the content before every single list item I can just target the list (ul > li) once in my css and get rid of the original list styling thats there and add my own check marks to the :before of every list item. makes it a bit cleaner and is easily added to every single list item with only one line of code."
css,f2y3e68,t3_ddl5kl,1570485687.0,"not sure if you got this figured out yet or not, but in general if you want to position an element within another element you make the outer container (in your case the whole slider container) position relative, then make the item on the inside (in your case the button) position absolute. then on the inner item (the button) you can put ""bottom: 10px"" and it'll be exactly 10px from the bottom of the slider because it keeps it inside the relative container around it. hope that is helpful if you still need any help!"

polyamory,ewglw04,t1_ewgl8ah,1565384825.0,"Yeah I do definitely know there’s mono couples who have become poly in a really healthy way too. I mean I’m even dating someone who is married and became poly after they got married and are doing great with it. Really mostly just wanted to meet some people who figured it out in similar ways that I did, cuz I don’t see many posts about that haha. But that does sound really lucky for you :) I was never bad at mono in the way that I would cheat, but I didn’t like the restrictions on how close you can become to people cuz I have a lot of love to give and want to explore that in any way it could happen! I also haaaated having to find “the one” that fits all my needs. That was my biggest struggle. Giving up people just because they wouldn’t work for me as my life partner even though I still loved them. Seems like a terrible way to live to me."
polyamory,ewgkina,t1_ewext1o,1565383919.0,"100% agree. I'm so happy I got to this conclusion about myself as a single person. obviously there were things in past relationships that pushed me towards thinking this way, but ultimately it was because I was personally uncomfortable with aspects of mono when I was doing it. I currently only have one partner but I'm so much happier with him because of the total mindset change poly gave me about relationships. it isn't always even about dating multiple people, but just the way you think about relationships and always having that opportunity to meet other people and let relationships grow into whatever you want them to all on your own. its great not having to dictate how you live/how close you are to people based on a relationship/someone else in your life. and sometimes I think people do that when they become poly through a relationship too, its just another form of letting their partner kinda dictate how they should live their life, instead of figuring it out on their own for themselves."
polyamory,ewgk3xi,t1_ewdx4y5,1565383653.0,"sounds great that you figured all that out for yourself and found a community that helped you with it so much. thanks for sharing :) and also good for you for talking to your partner about it and ending the relationship when it didn't work, instead of trying to make it work/have your partner learn to deal with it. I see so many struggling relationships that are mono/poly relationships."
polyamory,ewgjxrt,t1_ewdx1lt,1565383541.0,"I totally agree about it being way easier to start when you are single and a lot better to be able to figure out what YOU want personally with no one else's input, and then live your life that way with like-minded people. definitely what I have done and have been super happy with it. just have found sometimes its hard to relate to a lot of people on this tread who are posting about relationship issues with their partner who decided they were poly or that they opened their relationship and they can't handle it or their partner cheated and now are saying they are poly.... all just seems somewhat unhealthy to me so wanted to post and find my like-minded people! :P"
polyamory,ewgjqv4,t1_ewekpi7,1565383419.0,"yeah I would currently consider myself solo poly. but definitely not opposed to falling in love and being in serious relationships, but also want to keep my own independence. the longer I am poly the more I feel like I don't think I ever want to live with someone/have a nesting partner. just want to be free to love who I want and have whoever I want over to MY place. but yeah I feel like sometimes I read about all these issues people are having in their relationships because someone came out as poly or they decided together to open it up and I just sometimes think its a lot more important and better to figure out whats best for YOU before trying to do it within a relationship. not saying that everyone who starts in a relationship is unhealthy or anything, just sometimes feels like people aren't really thinking enough about it for themselves."
polyamory,ewdp4jn,t3_cmwhcl,1565304671.0,"this is definitely something I've thought about. I have a very solo-poly mindset too. currently I cannot see myself ever wanting to nest with someone, which is weird because it used to be my life plan before I realized that mono wasn't for me haha. but yeah idk, if it is more of an upgrade to your life than do it. that's kinda how I feel about it, if I meet someone that it just makes sense with someday and all my worries about it are discussed (like having people over whenever I'd like to) and an agreement is met then I think I would do it. just would have to be the right circumstances."

polyamory,etapgry,t3_ca6cud,1562625798.0,"you honestly sound very similar to what I want out of life. I have had some not so great break ups too, course mine were with mono relationships... but took some time to reflect about myself and just realized I had been spending too much time trying to find someone to complete my life and fit everything I needed instead of completing my own life and dating people as an addition to that, instead of a need. Currently am dating someone who is married and its been going great. I plan on living my life as basically single and poly. I don't plan on living with anyone/having a nesting partner... but instead I want to live alone have my own space and privacy and date people outside of that. and the more and more I live like this the more I like that life plan. and I don't think that its wrong or just fucking with peoples emotions at all. you can still have committed relationships without settling down with one person. in the same way you can be committed to friendships. do what you want with your life and don't let other people tell you otherwise. I have even been considering possibly having kids on my own someday in the future when I'm ready... my parents tell me thats not a stable environment for a child but I don't think thats true at all. you can make any environment stable for a kid, it depends on how much time and effort you put into parenting. but anyway, point is, this is your life and you should live it however you want to and in whatever way will make you the most happy because you only live once. don't just appease everyone else."
polyamory,etao5ns,t3_car1kw,1562624859.0,okcupid is the best I've found. actually am dating someone who is married who I met on there. you can put that you are seeing someone and are non-monogamous on there. also can link your profile to the person you're married to if you want to.
polyamory,etam674,t3_capyhs,1562623487.0,"In my opinion there is no such thing as a ""perfect match."" No two people can match perfectly and have absolutely NOTHING missing and when people say they've found their soulmate or perfect match they are just fooling themselves. It might feel that way at first... but it won't always feel that way. Marriages like that can work, and monogamy can work if the two people love each other and work together and work through their problems and have good communication... but I guarantee that if people are fully honest they cannot possibly say their one partner has EVERYTHING they could ever ask for and nothing could be improved.  


I have been through some hard mono relationships, and I am a pretty bit romantic and have gotten myself in pretty deep with a couple people who I thought would be my person. but they never worked out and now I'm happy for it. it has made me a better person. I feel like I can complete MYSELF now and I honestly have no desire to get married someday. not even sure if I ever want a nesting partner. currently just want to live a life where I live on my own and date people who I like. which is what's so great about poly, you can get different things from different people and not put so much pressure on yourself about finding ""the one.""  


don't be down on yourself or feel like you're missing something. in my personal opinion sometimes I think a lot of mono people are missing something :P poly isn't for anyone but I think it could be for more people than it is if we weren't brought up to think the world worked a certain way and that we are supposed to find one person to ""complete"" us. I say you should complete yourself and find people to add to your life instead of complete it. it sounds great that you have two partners that you love, you shouldn't downgrade those relationships just because you don't think they'd match as ""the one."""
