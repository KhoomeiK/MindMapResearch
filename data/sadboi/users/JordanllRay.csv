BattlefieldV,fmrw2y1,t1_fmr861l,1586337597.0,"Personally I disagree. Thought bf1 was a much more mechanically sound game, even if there were some trips. 

For me, planes really are just annoying in both games. But it’s very difficult to patch because they are meant to be overpowered in the sense they can clear large groups with bombs. 

Tanks felt powerful but damage with them is more consistent than bfv, due to the weird repair buff things. I have shot tanks with so many rockets as assault and then ,after being killed, find they still have half health, which is very frustrating. The whole aspect of a tank is that you work together to take it down.

To me behemoths were actually cool. It’s a lot more than bfv with its single cool event of the v1. 
Plus those squad leadership take a lot less skill compared to the behemoths which could still be taken down. 

Really the only thing I notice is the movement is much MUCH better in bfv. I like it’s fluidity more and actually that keeps me playing it over bf1."

When it comes to melody, he also made [this](https://youtu.be/twE9rR7re7c) on scales and how to approach making decent melodic sounds.
