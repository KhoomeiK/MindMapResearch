CPTSD,fae40cw,t1_fae3ym1,1575993220.0,Thank you for responding! Which one had the greatest impact on you?
CPTSD,fae3sld,t3_e8pxux,1575993086.0,"Good on you for sitting and acknowleging the discomfort! Not the easiest thing to do I bet 


I work really long hours (15+hr days), in one of my first reviews with my boss he said “sometimes the reality is *you just need to kill yourself at work in this job*, you’re doing great at it - what a strong work ethic” 


I’m still too afraid to change, and the work has become a debilitating addiction"

If anyone has read it and has some good takeaways, I’d love to know!

Edit: I just read this brief summary review , if anyone’s interested out there: https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/suffer-the-children/201206/the-drama-the-gifted-child

I believe that the body keeps score touches on CPTSD and this type of intense  parenting (which makes sense given that the child is an extension of a narcissistic parent)."
BPD,f9g3pee,t3_e4qkql,1575292795.0,"I’m going through weekly schema therapy and DBT. Currently I’m 23. 

Responsibility wise I’ve always felt older than I am, having to take care of household bills cleaning cooking etc from 14 years old (mum had clinical depression). I work full time and appear stable on the outside. 

But deep inside I feel like a child. My therapist calls this the “little (my name)” that I need to nurture and grow. It exists because my emotional and mental growth was stunted as no adult as properly raising me. 

Schema therapy makes me feel like I’m a shell adult raising a little girl inside of me to be the adult I eventually want to be. Working decently so far."

AskReddit,f92gysp,t3_e380ez,1575030678.0,"**This hit really close to home. My most recent attempt at taking my life was mid September 2018, just a little over a year ago. It was my third attempt.**

This might get lost in the sea of comments but here goes. After I got released from the hospital, I got some serious help, got in appropriate meds and attend therapy weekly (religiously! I never miss an appointment unless I’m not in town). 

Since my attempt, I got accepted into a magic circle law firm summer associateship and will be commencing to work for a judge at my state’s Supreme Court next year (where I am from this is equivalent to clerking at a circuit court in USA... sort of) before beginning my grad role I never thought I had it in me, I really didn’t. Even now I put this down to unbelievable luck. 

I also met a wonderful man who I’m about to move in with. He’s faithful, considerate, kind and makes me laugh on a daily basis — a far cry from my cheating abusive ex boyfriend (who triggered my last suicide attempt). My partner is supportive, proud of me and really understanding of my mental health issues. Today’s thanksgiving and I’ve realised that I’m really grateful for him. 

They’re just two major things that I would’ve missed out on. Writing this made me tear up, I really thought I didn’t want to live a year ago but now? I feel invigorated and really hopeful."
BPD,exswg6r,t3_cu077z,1566558315.0,"This speaks so much. With my ex boyfriend he was always quite invalidating and narcissistic (rhodes scholar style) so it would be so toxic and fire up immediately. So tbh, it’s just as much about your partner. Sometimes it’s valid to want to run away from toxicity to save yourself. 

With my current boyfriend, I’ve learn that the trick is to really slow down - actions, breathing etc. sensations also really help - whether it’s really cold water, holding my hand on a warm mug, or even going out and feeling the wine. 

Once I’ve slowed down then the argument doesn’t spiral in the same way that leads me jumping to “fuck this is not going to work I want to run away and leave”, and then that’s when you can constructively solve it, which really helps in terms of being confident about your relationship."
BPD,ew43275,t3_cmns4d,1565101663.0,"Odd question but must be asked because of the high rate of co-morbidity, do you also have a CPTSD diagnosis? I do so I told my bf that, and helped him learn more about complex trauma, and the symptoms that comes out of it (basically BPD symptoms), and in that funny circular sense that’s how I told him. 

Personally I think I did ok, as I didn’t lie, I just did it in a less confronting manner."

GetMotivated,euknxv0,t1_eukgouw,1563890879.0,"There are 900,000 members of the CCP, it’s like signing up to be a democrat... and CCP includes all levels of government that are usually divided in the west (federal state local council etc). *Civilians do win cases* but it’s **very** rare because the level of corruption in judges is way too high. Judges also don’t get paid nearly enough (compared to western countries), so they are more vulnerable to bribes too (and greedy)."

BPD,eq30cmc,t3_bx39cb,1559747352.0,Hmmm DBT is way better for pwBPDs than CBT I’d say. I’ve started with some meditation apps and it’s helped me a lot. Maybe give those a go?

BPD,ep1rky1,t3_btr5vh,1558994441.0,"If you can see yourself with them I would also hope that they’re the understanding type. I told my partner that I experienced a lot of childhood trauma about 4 dates in (give or take). I told him I had CPTSD roughly 6 weeks in, and I only told him I had BPD, much later, a few months in. He just shrugged and said “yeah that makes sense ... so? This all happened to you and you’re working on it still. I’m so proud of you” I was so anxious for so long about the stigma surrounding BPD. 

TLDR: you’d hope that the person you date is someone you trust. It’s okay to gradually reveal aspects over time."

BPD,ep0lwtb,t1_eozmgat,1558977184.0,"Day to day memories: no, I’ll have to rely on photos to trigger the memories. I think this is normal. 

But also if it’s a really really traumatic memory (like a lot of us have experienced) then i find that it’s often quite visceral and It feels like you’re reliving it in that moment."
