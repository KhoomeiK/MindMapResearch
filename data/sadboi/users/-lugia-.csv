I have 12 big sharks sitting in my bank rn and I’m at 91 fishing. 
I will mount maybe 1 or 2 of them in my house but no idea what to do with the other 10 apart from high alching. 
Would be so much better for them to have another use!"
skyrim,fpadjju,t3_gc63bz,1588445929.0,"Don’t just follow the main storyline. 

There are so many side quests for you to do where you can discover things that you wouldn’t normally come across. They also help with unlocking dragon shouts (these are really handy for progressing in the game, killing enemies and also just messing around). If you have all the expansions, in my opinion make sure you do Miraaks storyline pretty early on as the reward is pretty great/fun!"

relationship_advice,fel3d77,t3_eppp55,1579213181.0,"It is absolutely fine to take a break and focus on yourself if you are not feeling great mentally. Sometimes it can do wonders for yourself and for your relationships. 

Just make sure this break is for you and take into consideration that there is a possibility that you or the other person may not want to continue the relationship in the future. 
Communication is key so if you tell this person that you would like to continue your relationship with them after you have had time to yourself, make sure you let them know honestly throughout, especially if this changes."
relationship_advice,fel0dsp,t3_eppqfr,1579211366.0,"Your friend is awful for stabbing you in the back and your girlfriend is awful for entertaining him.

Both have lied to you in one way or another so your best bet is to cut them both off.

If he was truly your friend he wouldn’t be inappropriately speaking to your girlfriend and if she truly cared for you/your relationship she wouldn’t be lying to you or be going behind your back.

I’m sorry this is happening to you."
relationship_advice,fekyy8b,t3_eppqi0,1579210509.0,"It will hurt but I think the best thing to do is to cut him off and move on. 

It doesn’t sound like he has been all that great towards you in regards to your feelings (for example dating someone that caused a heartbreak, ignoring your heartfelt messages) and I can’t imagine that you would treat him this way even if the tables were turned. 

One of the hardest things to do is move on when you are in love with someone, but you just need to let go and remember he is not the person you thought you knew. Holding onto that hope that everything will go back to how it was may only be detrimental to you. In time it does get better.

Try and focus on things you enjoy doing, whether it be reading, going on walks, playing a game, hanging out with friends or even just staying at home and relaxing. 

You can always strengthen the friendships you have with people and can always develop new relationships.
Spend this time to focus on yourself and remember that you deserve someone who truly wants and cares about you, this person does not seem to fit that description and it seems he will not change his mind. 

You deserve better!"

Friday the majority of it passed but from Saturday - now I have been having cramps that are varying in intensity. 

I think it is normal to still be having cramps as I believe it is the uterus going back to normal, plus if you are still bleeding it will also be due to that.

I was told by the doctor that it can last for around 3 weeks, as long as the pain isn’t unbearable and there isn’t lots of blood I think you are okay!"
