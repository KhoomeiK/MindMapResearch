depression,fr4gub7,t3_gmdwmu,1589887795.0,"The things you act upon FEEL like distractions to you because you KNOW you want a deeper MEANING to all of it. If you feel something is boring under a depressive state its because your are not MOTIVATED with MEANING. Your life seems boring and empty watching netflix because you CRAVE UPON DEEPER MEANING AND CONNECTION. You are right, your current path is riddled with landmines to be dismantled by MEANING. You can even go out to a party and label it a distraction afterwards. We look upon the world through the eyes of the meaning we give to all things. Currently as I write this I am pissed of that all my life is derived from bullying trauma events that happened years before and screwed up my decision making abilities (just to name the thing I‚Äôm working emotionally now, because it screwed a lot or other things, namely my health) and my brain is searching for meaning, today I‚Äôm thinking about this aspect, tomorrow I will continue on other thing, but all of this is happening naturally... because I intertwine distractions with one thing... STOP.. STOP AND LISTEN. STOP AND LISTEN to current active emotional distress, stop and you will start thinking about things on a more profound level, it will be painful because the search for meaning is not without change. But... get this ‚Äúnothing really interesting happens without active doubt‚Äù. That ACTIVE doubt is what depressives suppressed by default and got really good at it... you feel empty because you are filled with unprocessed events to give meaning to.  Now, Distractions are great... they are a great way to not overload on the meaning discovery that is painful, and so we must take breaks, but if we do distractions all the time, one after the other... what are you distracting yourself from?.... the unprocessed pain."

Do the best you can to dissociate from being X, you are in a X symptoms state and that is all. Nothing is lost, at all. When the mind clears everything is back, you have not suffered brain trauma, the brain is intact and is just stuck in this weird pathology loop, I believe anxiety loops such as trauma are the cause of depression and once you uncover and dig up the psychological pain the brain unstucks itself and everything is back. Its unfair but that unfairness is one secondary reason to wallow in the mire and those reasons are always available, but those are dead ends to pursue. Reach for the light, get critical mass of ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù in and the next steps will be easier and easier. Its a dark alley without exit, the true path is to go back to the light. üåà"

There is this infinite streams of woman out thee and they are of all sizes and forms and a lot of pretty ones too.

depression,fqujxlk,t3_gktyww,1589660129.0,"Of course you don‚Äôt do them, you just said so. The reason depression stucks people in is because somehow, somewhere there is this bit that is flipped and gives reason to the most futile things ever and the key is to learn to say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and just give up the resistance. Why are you resistant to do things you say you want to do? Why do you even want them in the first place since you are resisting and insisting the futility of wishing things to be done and not doing them at the same time. This, and many depression aspects is like sitting in front of a door, knowing it will be always be closed, and just staying there sitting waiting, because somehow, who knows, the door might open.... and we stay forever waiting for futile things... the cure is to just give up, stand up, and find another door. Accept the futility to want things and never do them, accept the ridiculous of it all, don‚Äôt push against it, its futile to do so. Get up and go find another door."

Its better to go the right direction than not at all, in fact I think you were brave to do it, Or weren‚Äôt you? Its terrible to have resort to these things? It might but if you have trauma that locked your sexual self up you are entitled to use wherever means to get the ball rolling because those school years where you got bullying trauma or whatever happened to you are gone and you did not got out with girls at the right time and you needed to express your sexual energy somehow. Its not shameful, be proud. You could be home jerking one of and be there forever, instead it took guts to do what you did to get some kind of sexual ball rolling. Its step 1."

It demands a lot of attention and energy while you are going over on autopilot but what if you can actually change the past? What if instead of letting your current perception of wrongdoing take the pilot seat don‚Äôt you take the wheel and start imagining? I believe there is a lot to gain from going into the dark and confronting it in some ways to discharge it (therapy of all sorts) but also just going and throwing in some imagination acts of will of how things could turn out but this time without regrets, just feeling it as you did it and that was your past life. Why shouldn‚Äôt you enjoy your past while thinking about alternative versions of you? We spend a lot of time on negative bias so I say, fuck it, lets create a positive bias, so what its imaginary, the negative bias also is imagination but its detrimental instead of uplifting. So, what we choose we get, what we resist persists and all that. Also. There‚Äôs this quite real possibility that reality is all energy and information so, going back and changing that energy can have an impact on your present reality like a butterfly effect. Get the girl of your dreams in your imagination, why should you feel pain by that, that alternative has power and should feel good, it hasn‚Äôt happened in your current perspective but on the alternative reality that you are creating it did. All of reality is subjective as we all know from even standard therapy, reframing is basically telling a different viewpoint from the same story so, that‚Äôs all there is.

Fibromyalgia,flk3hzx,t1_flk2dj2,1585233144.0,"Yeah, my subject was probably hastily written.

Anxiety is such a charged word, varies considerable from person to person.

I use it as the medical definition which is known to create a mindless weirdness of somatic pain.

Trauma is really a silent killer, maybe we are all different and have different threshold of ‚Äútriggers‚Äù .

Maybe she would be happy if her mother didn‚Äôt died at the same time.

Randomness is hard to accept... maybe that was my point."
Fibromyalgia,flk1i27,t1_flk0wtc,1585231902.0,"My understanding is the following:

‚ÄúIts not in our heads‚Äù. I am totally on the same boat.

Also, 30 years of misery here and I have read papers as you pointed before. 

Its not in out heads but might be on the neurological fabric itself caused by traumatic events. A kind of feedback loop from hell.

That is my take on it. I am not at all a one sided person at all.

I just threw out a possibility based on an intense and personal conversation with a sufferer like us.

That‚Äôs all."

depression,fljyrya,t3_fp5gzo,1585230112.0,"I like this post! I like this post a lot.

I have been thinking if there is a way to think about all this Mistakes Forever Pain and these are my discoveries so far, it touches at least on the interactions with others....

Its All Feedback, positive or negative is a non issue. Why?

Every human being has a personal unique viewpoint.

There are no Knights coming to rescue in your tower.

Every human is up or lower on the I Am Okay scale on each and every subject/theme.

Each interaction with other human being is done point to point. For example you feel sucky and talk with someone who is okay in health. They will listen to you and be present if that is the case but then they will hang up the phone and continue on their merry life and that is OKAY.

Turn it around, you are talking to some other individual about an issue where you excel and the other sucks. You tell them everything, you scratch your head because they don‚Äôt get it. They walk away frustrated and that is OKAY.

This might sound philosophical but I believe a sort of grand relativization might be achieved. Might help to put thing in perspective."
Fibromyalgia,fljti0x,t3_fp2f9y,1585226085.0,"Accept. Let go.

This is not the last straw. There are always more straws and the bottom is not fixed.

Tough love? Sure. I apply it to myself everyday.

There is always, always something to be bummed about because of Pain. There is no escape, only relief. But the relief has many grades and it can be liberating sometimes, so even the prison has moving walls.

Accept. Let go.

Each and every day, the choice of overcoming the challenge. The major challenge is always the same. To let go and accept."

I lost everything about my Health and Mental Acuity two years ago. Mental breakdown with huge physical pain for 8 months coupled with acute insomnia.

For 30 years I struggled with bullying trauma that I did not recognized it existed

I struggled and struggled; found alternative doctor who healed my worst

Found a new therapist where the old one had failed me.

Recovery is ups and downs. We all know that.

We are all like rats on a treadmill but hey, look at the right side of that treadmill and what you see? The rat keeps going and going and yet the right side is open and he can jump if the chooses to.

We can choose everyday to get better, to jump out of the treadmill.

What is the alternative?"
depression,fljmc6p,t3_fozmk5,1585218745.0,"Yes. I think this is the most trashy aspect of it. I have a bad case of it so I understand.

So....

Phase 1: Cure Anxiety
Phase 2: ?
Phase 3: Profit!!"
NevilleGoddard,fljlx47,t1_fljjrqe,1585218242.0,"What‚Äôs the alternative indeed. That‚Äôs a most impactful comment.

The thing is, this feels like a rat race because the rat keeps pumping those legs and going for it turning the wheel over and over like an obsession.

What the mouse fails to realize is that the right side on the wheel is actually open and he can jump out at anytime.

This is what we are. Rat Racing sometimes but always with the option to jump out."

Its called Civic Inattention, I‚Äôm not making this up... its a really interesting concept, you can google it I‚Äôm sure. Basically we wonder this world not interacting and paying attention to pretty much everyone who crosses with us on the streets. If we did we would fundamentally delay us all to a crawl and would create tiredness and all sorts of issues just by acknowledging every single person there is out there. That‚Äôs why we have close circles of various degrees and many ways of interacting in the world or online. There are ways to feel the world and feel others that are not based on pure interacting; I dunno, lets call it sensitivity or standoff pleasure or mindfulness that capture the essence of the environment and allows us to navigate our life without overwhelming our circuits with randomness."

You are possibly under just brain fog and the underlying issues are there for you to dig and start the journey of recovery. Blank sheet of paper causes creative blocks on writers so might be like a version of that."

Discharges are damn important and you don‚Äôt need to take everyone shit and be silent, in some instances that Bitch might be asking for it on the right spot, maybe learn a thing or two on the interaction. Other people are not as bad as we think but sometimes they do act bad and may deserve a bit of tough love there. If you feel angry you might punch some can or something and that solves it, the other person needs something different, but random bad people should be put in their place.

Start thinking its hard to function as a human being, why should you pretend at all? Then start thinking as a human being just functioning, then start thinking you‚Äôre functioning as a human being with ups and down, then you go up bit by bit.

NevilleGoddard,fk159xe,t3_ffk07d,1583772680.0,"Resistance is our mind trapped in a loop mindlessly (as minds tend to do) calculating all the repercussions of this and that and major things on that calculus happen to be of negative scenarios being played and evaluated so, basically, we are focusing on ‚Äúnot wanted‚Äù by the Resistance process of evaluating/conjuring multitude scenarios and what to make of it.

The true pitty of all this for someone who uses mind and a tool to do this kind of navigating the world is that our very core operating system trashes our life to a pit because of the old model of having thoughts of bad things that might happen as a way to defend against them (even if that brought a tinge of bad emotion), however the reality is that all that mindless scenario running places our very Soul and core at the worst scenarios ever, spiraling down with each mind run because we are not just a computer, we are alive and attracting all of it.

So yeah, I wish someone explained this to me as a child... would save me from a great deal of suffering. But never mind. The past does not equal the future.
