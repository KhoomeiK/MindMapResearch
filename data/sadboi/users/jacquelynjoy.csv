Because that matters."" When he beats and strangles Bellamy while he's on the chip, when Clarke pulls the lever and everyone wakes up he cries because he's so horrified at what he's done. In a perfect piece of acting, he stares at his hands as if he can't believe how they've betrayed him. 

In Season 4 as he's coaching Bellamy to not let himself get hurt trying to save one person, he tells Bellamy that Bellamy's mother would be so proud of him. This absolutely destroys Bellamy, already on edge from not being able to save them, and he shoots back--""You floated my mother."" You can immediately tell that Kane is hurt and ashamed.

And you're right, he turns it around fast! Faster than Bellamy, for sure.

I could write a whole essay on Monty in Season 3 but I'll save it for another time. Suffice it to say, his characterization makes some big moves. Christopher Larkin's acting, especially in Nevermore, is absolutely amazing. (We always talk about how Lindsey is so great in that episode--and she is! But Chris knocks it out of the park too.) It kills me that we will never see Octavia react to Monty's death considering that he gave her such a pep talk about belonging to him/them and then killed his own damn mother to save her.

You have to remember that before they slaughter Trikru's sleeping army Bell is betrayed by Grounders in a significant way twice: Lexa at Mount Weather and then Echo at Mount Weather. Both ended in a lot of people dying, including Gina, his girlfriend. Bellamy knows that Kane and Clarke are trying to make alliances but his faith in Clarke has been shaken by the fact that she left him and the others after the events of Season 2. He's even more upset by the fact that Clarke is placing so much faith in Lexa, who let her down in Season 2. I feel like he absolutely has his head done in by that bit. He asks Clarke to come home and Lexa smoothly tells him, ""Clarke is safe here under my protection."" -- I can just imagine him thinking, where was your protection three months ago?

Not to mention that they were at war with The Grounders for all of Season 1 and are constantly on unsure footing. 

It's so crazy that Bellamy, the ""heart"" portion of ""the head and the heart"" goes so far so fast. I wish there'd been more episodes that season instead of us having to conjecture the hell out of it. In any case, when Pike is willing to kill Lincoln, Kane, etc, that's too far for Bellamy. I often wonder if he would have gone to the same lengths to save Lincoln if Kane and Sinclair hadn't been sentenced too?

Clarke is constantly harangued for her decisions, even when those decisions saved her people. 

Are we talking consequences? In Season 6 Octavia is literally cast out from her people because of what happens in Season 5--Bellamy tells her he wishes she was dead in the Season 5 finale, and Indra tells her she broke Wonkru. 

Bellamy's actions in Season 3 are not truly addressed because there was no time--we went straight from Lincoln's death to trying to get Luna to take the chip, to running to Polis to stop Ontari's ascension, to Clarke going into the City of Light, to trying to save humanity, to blasting off into space. Still, we see that Bellamy is torn up over what's happened--and he takes Octavia's beating for Lincoln's death because he thinks he deserves it. He apologizes to Nylah (and gentle as she is, she does NOT accept this apology) and later expresses to Clarke that he feels like he lost his way. He also deals with Octavia hating him for what happened with Lincoln and Trikru all the way up to Die All, Die Merrily. Even as late as Season 6, Bellamy says he sees the faces of those he killed in his nightmares. Even if there isn't anything that happens onscreen, I think Bellamy has always been written in such a way that we know his actions weigh heavily on his heart.

There isn't time for ""accountability"" among these people because they are fighting to survive. And as usual I have to say that we personally have no idea the lengths we would go to if we were in their shoes. Why should we want them to suffer for the decisions they made to save themselves or those they love? I want them to ""do better"" as they said last season, I really do, but I'm not going to judge them for the choices they make in the meantime."

I was just responding to what you said. 

I personally don't see them as having complimentary personalities because I feel we haven't really seen Gaia's personality. She does things, but do they really show who she is on the inside? And even if I do extrapolate some deeper personality there...I'm sorry, but I just don't see her, a third rate character at best, as being good enough for Clarke. They don't have a connection other than Madi. They haven't leaned on each other through terrifying times when their people were in danger. They haven't been vulnerable together. They haven't led together. Gaia hasn't stood up to Clarke nor reached out to share a burden with her. There are other people who have. Stronger bonds. I don't think Season 7 is going to change that and even further I don't want Season 7 to focus on that kind of thing. People who already love each other, who have already walked through the fire together--I want more of that.

He must be very handsome - it's the only reason I can think of that two kickass women would be willing to fight for him, because he has the personality of a dish mop.

THANK YOU! I absolutely cannot stand him."

* Linnet, the businesswoman, isn't surprised that ""Uncle Andrew"" has all this paperwork?
* I cannot be arsed to care about this communist character. There's someone like him in every book Dame Agatha wrote after a certain time period. 
* Simon, please shut up.
* Of COURSE Pennington is thrown by Linnet wanting to read over all the papers. He is soooooo sketchy.

The100,fqlyzui,t1_fqlxfbz,1589468624.0," ***But that doesn't mean its right and that is an observation I have every right to have, just like anyone else.*** 

I'm sorry, you said observation not opinion. Either way. I didn't say you don't have a right to it.

I have to get ready for work, but I think I've lost the plot on what we're arguing about anymore in any case. You're right--Luna is a monster Skaikru and Treekru created. My original point was this--I am only trying to express that Skaikru is directly responsible for Luna's anger at humanity in general."
NameNerdCirclejerk,fqlx6km,t3_gjlbb7,1589467704.0,Or they REALLY like the show Bones...
The100,fqlx0rt,t1_fqlwj6t,1589467623.0,I'm not saying you don't have a right to your opinion. I'm literally listening to your opinion and discussing it with you.
The100,fqlul4i,t1_fqlrxms,1589466354.0,"How I feel about this is how I feel about the show in general -- people say things like ""Oh, this is totally wrong, I wouldn't do this or that."" or things like, ""She acted in such and such way and it's so inexcusable."" But that's a ridiculous thing to say because in that situation we have no idea HOW we would react! 

Imagine--you are a child raised to be a warrior. You have to fight your friends and kill your brother, so you run. You make a small community that you love and one day a crew of people comes in and your community experiences a huge tragedy because those people brought horrible things to you. And then radioactive fish kill everyone you love and you THOUGHT that those people who fucked your community up could save them, but they couldn't, so they remain unredeemed in your eyes. AND THEN those people who brought tragedy to you drag you to a lab and torture you and take away your autonomy--for nothing, in essence. They can't save the world with your blood after all. 

We cannot say how we would react to all of that because for us there is nothing we will ever experience that can compare to Luna's life. Or Jasper's. Or Clarke's. So saying her decisions or her actions are ridiculous and not logical or don't make sense is unfair, because we don't understand on a deep level how we would react to such things, and with a little luck we'll never experience or understand them."

The100,fqlr7zo,t1_fqkpbpq,1589464524.0,True! I totally forgot about how she kills Emerson--even though I just watched that episode! That definitely raised the stakes for Clarke.
The100,fqlqyvh,t1_fql2zrk,1589464385.0,"She knew why they needed to do that, yes. But she didn't agree that living was worth torturing people--her experience at Becca's lab led directly to her feelings that people don't deserve to survive. 

I don't love Luna deciding to kill all of humanity. I'm just saying that she makes Skaikru's part in it pretty clear."
The100,fqkhfnx,t1_fqkgbia,1589427371.0,Bellamy's reaction to Clarke's death in Season 6 is the most extreme emotional reaction he's had to anything since he thought Octavia was dead in early Season 4.

I think the point of the episode is to pull everyone together again and have Clarke fight to save them, so they're a group united in purpose once more."
The100,fqk2izz,t3_gjbmli,1589419060.0,"I think they were going to attack--and if Jasper hadn't been extra attuned to them because of his PTSD, they may have killed everyone before being caught!"
