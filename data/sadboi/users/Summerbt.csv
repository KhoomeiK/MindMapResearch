It is clear you‚Äôve either lived through this or witnessed something similar because you get it. I hadn‚Äôt intended to acknowledge abuse with anyone that hadn‚Äôt already shared their story with me or reached out independently. It is a delicate time. I will stick close to my cousin that was and is the target of confused anger and hurt from my family she needs the support and she is the one I am closest with. Thank you again.

I was thinking of calling and sending a card to his son because he doesn‚Äôt have huge support system acknowledging the loss and offering my support, he was also subjected to abuse/witnessed abuse by this individual. I‚Äôm also checking in regularly with the other cousin. Anyway, it‚Äôs complicated I very much appreciate you sharing your experience and thoughts. All I can do is my best at this point.

minimalism,fcoauz0,t1_fcmi6gy,1577827746.0,Right! Got a bit of a [descriptivism v prescriptivism](https://www.thoughtco.com/descriptivism-language-term-1690441) battle going on in here. I just don‚Äôt like it when innocuous language is weaponized. I am a little surprised with how pro-consumption this particular thread is. üò¨
minimalism,fco9e1a,t1_fcm9fie,1577826737.0,That‚Äôs why I use what I have until it doesn‚Äôt work any more and scavenge when necessary. It‚Äôs difficult to use the non-consumerist technique when there is so much pressure to be minimalist in a very certain way. Granted minimalism had a very specific definition in the 60s-70s but even that definition evolved over time as artists were influenced. I think it is rad that we are ready to expand that now. Maybe it needs a new word maybe it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm with ya!
minimalism,fco8lj5,t3_ehvo6j,1577826194.0,I really appreciate your take on ‚Äúminimalism‚Äù. I plan to apply this to my life. There is a lot of consumerist pressure to buy things and redesign your hour in a ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù way which is really not what I‚Äôm looking to get out of joining this group. Maybe there is a better community for people like you and I that are not interested in minimalism for its aesthetic but we are looking for a community of people that don‚Äôt keep very many things but what they do keep is significant to their lives. I‚Äôve accidentally done this through poverty and a relatively transient life style recently. For me purging art supplies is one of the most difficult things emotionally because I think of myself as a creative person. I‚Äôm open to suggestions if anyone feel like there is a better community for this. Thank you for your post.

ptsd,f6u9z7r,t3_dsw9c7,1573160036.0,"At the end of the day it‚Äôs is okay to not be okay. It is okay to eat cookies until you puke or drink or not want to sleep or to sleep all the time. It is ok to cry in the shower or be obsessed with going to gym, it‚Äôs ok to become religious or cynical. I always get this image of a grown me curling around a baby me without away to properly protect it. Eventually the baby me sort of dissolves back into my body and I get up and do the things. But it‚Äôs ok for you to sit beside yourself and give yourself special care or attention. If you find yourself taking it out on others I would explain briefly if it makes sense to and then maybe tuck away into a mini personal vacation.

When I do this I take time to reflect on why consciousness is exciting and unique even if dreadful. It‚Äôs an opportunity that we know for sure that we get once, right now. Maybe not ever again, maybe not ever before. So I try to appreciate the experience of consciousness in and of itself. Takes a bit to get through but it‚Äôs a good way for me to reconnect with the fundamentals.

At some point I suppose I will lay down and decide ‚Äúwell that was interesting but I‚Äôm ready to go now‚Äù but I have a lot more experiencing and feeling and hurting and laughing and crying and being angry to do before then.
