I have had a number of psychiatrists during my adulthood, and all of them just seemed to want to throw in a prescription and get me out the door.  

At least where I live, (also a really hard-hit covid area), I am literally frightened of the thought that one day I will have to look for a new psych, even though I’m not 100% thrilled with the one I have...  my favorite psychiatrist was the one who misdiagnosed me at 21 years old (and I believed her for more than seven years).   Idk why it seems so hard to talk to them without issue, but OP, you are not alone with your problem, and I hope you can find someone else who doesn’t constantly compare you to them and forget sensitive things you told them...

Also, anxiety can be way more crippling than I think the mental health field overall realizes.   The reason I was originally misdiagnosed was because I had two psychotic breaks separated by two years...  and she thought this indicated a mood disorder.  My psychologist today, (who is incredible and I’ve seen for 5 years), honestly believes that they were nervous breakdowns caused by my anxiety getting completely out of hand and damaging my central nervous system...   interesting, eh?

Anxiety has always been an underlying issue of mine and it’s link with my adhd is undeniable, too.   (I clumsily break or lose something... and am “regretting” my lot in life....  snowball effect to me dropping, walking into, losing many things and becoming frantic).

There is one interpretation that can come from the psychiatrist’s statement, “what makes you think you’re different from me?” that does strike a rather positive note...  OP, you seem like a person who has succeeded in many aspects of life, despite (or in spite of) your mental health issues.   Perhaps that part is something that you can somehow remind yourself of.   I too, have succeeded with a post secondary degree and am in my second year of teaching, am about to celebrate one year wedding anniversary with my incredible husband, and my issues have made me more determined and more motivated overall, not less...  so even though it can be difficult to tell yourself that you’re awesome...  this stranger on the internet believes you are, from your story, so try to keep that in mind whenever you get into the mindset of beating yourself up about things you can’t help.  I get those beating yourself up moments, I’ve been there (just this morning), and we will be stronger for our struggles in the end!  😉"

therapy,fpfua0q,t3_gd4521,1588583742.0,"So, I can see both sides of this...   My husband is 10 years older than me...  which means completely nothing because we have the same values and goals in mind...  and some of OP’s descriptions of conversations with this older friend at first reminded me of when I met my husband and he shared with me his story...  losing his parents too young, basically raising his two brothers.  

There were some of the ways you (OP) described him picking on you that seemed not okay though...  and I met my husband when I was 26, so the dynamic was able to be very different, had we met when I was 14, I think things would certainly have been way different, just based on maturity level alone.  

That all said, however, your post seems to imply that you regret or are thinking of regretting your experiences with this person, and this is the mistake, I think.   Did you learn a lot by being his friend?   Did he help you through a tough time in your life at least at first?  It doesn’t sound like he was ever inappropriate with you or tried to do anything illegal, even if he did have a crush on you, so no regrets, or hard feelings.  20 year olds are kids, too, and everyone makes mistakes.   One day, perhaps any mistakes you both made can be attributed to youthful ignorance, and as long as you use what you learned moving forward in your life and relationships, there should not be anything to feel bad about.

I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder at 21, and was on depakote and abilify for more than seven years before I knew that it was a misdiagnosis.   

If you need to change meds, just be sure you will have the time and care you need to deal with the withdrawal.   Imagine if you were addicted to an illegal drug for all that time and recovering from addiction.   It can be done, even if it sucks!   I guess you just have to weigh the pros and cons, and decide if and when is the right time to change meds or get off of them, to see where you stand now...

Also, weaning off is way preferred to cold turkey all the sudden, although idk about your dosage.   Perhaps a good psychiatrist can help and monitor you while you try the transition?   I wouldn’t really trust my psych for something like that, although I suppose she’d definitely be on standby, but my psychologist understands a lot about meds and if I were attempting something like this I would have her aware and be taking her advice for sure.

Medication seems like the most experimental science that exists to me.   I can vouch that I have tried 99% more medications with terrible side effects I couldn’t handle than the 1% which wound up becoming my maintenance meds...  A lot of people seem to have this experience and I think trial and error, unfortunately and terribly perhaps is the only way, atm... 

That said, however, the experimental nature of medications doesn’t actually just apply to mental health medications.   My father takes a regular med for lowering his blood pressure, a he has for at least ten years.   He’s also a retired music teacher and multi-instrumentalist.  He was losing feeling in his hands and starting to be unable to play his instruments after years on this one bp med, and since the Drs thought it could be causing this, they switched it.  He still has issues sometimes with his hands, but not as frequently following the med change.

But I think my story just goes to show that, you have a heart condition and you take a heart med, that’s not 100% going to fix everything forever either.   So as long as we in the mental health field realize that, while our brain chemical balances are being treated (which I agree is a really difficult thing to quantify sometimes if we are succeeding or not), other treatments for health issues can and do have similar issues.   

Medicines are experimental, and I hope we all find the balance we can live with in the near future!"

Then there were friends that I really just wanted to be friends with, as I was in a relationship with someone else and they wanted more than that so I had to say, “well for now this friendship isn’t going to work...”. 

But now that I found my other half, and we got married last June, I would never be able to see another man in that light I am sure as long as I live.  I met my husband, and he is everything I didn’t think was possible in a person.   Hippie from the wrong generation like me, nerdy like me, loves nature, super organized, musician and incredible amount of appreciation for music, cat and animal-lover...  I still can’t believe he’s real sometimes, despite having known him 6 years now...  Relationships are hard work, and there are things in our upbringings that make our approach very different, and we tend to quibble a lot, but the hard work is so worthwhile.  

I dated quite a few people during my school years, and wasted time pining over others that would never view me in that way, and I suppose I don’t regret anything (because I learned from all of it).   But sometimes I wish I hadn’t felt in such a hurry to find love.   I met my husband when I was 26 years old.   We got married when I had just turned 31, and I wouldn’t have it any other way looking back...  My husband was like OP, anyone he had ever been interested in a relationship with before me couldn’t see him that way, and when I fell for him, he couldn’t believe it.   We were, and are both so lucky to have each other.   That person for OP is out there...  I am so sure of it!

I am not the most socially aware being by a long shot.   My husband is often reminding me when I’m missing someone else’s drift, and I often leave social situations feeling disappointed, “why did I say X?” Or “why didn’t I say Y?”  in my head and venting to my family (bc they understand me for the most part).   That said however, I never stop trying to be sociable, because the thought that “because I made it awkward this person now hates me” is just not true.  People are worth the struggle to me.   Whether they understand me or not, I won’t stop giving them my smile, an ear, having a conversation, disappointing as it may wind up being, I know that my thoughts that pop up about it probably aren’t rational, and some of the people I talk to probably benefit from our conversations more than I can ever know.

My husband is delivering mail every day and still on the front lines, as well.   Just remember what an amazing job you’re doing!   It is more important now, than ever before!!!  

When you arrive home, after a day of excessive sanitizing and hand washing, I recommend Vaseline as a hand moisturizer.  Especially after a shower and/or before bed (preferably both)!   It really works for us for dry skin, and if your skin heals on your hands you’ll be better protected from infection that way also.   I literally use Vaseline throughout the day, every day, after almost every hand washing.   It’s amazing stuff.

Taking the angle perhaps, of the people who need you at work, trying to think of your job in terms of their perspective...  especially now.   And then trying to let go of anything you have no control over.   Be proud of what you do, there’s no one braver.   ❤️"

So, for me, I realized that the reason I was in the scariest and most awful situation, was because at the time I had been interested in ‘hooking up’ with a stranger, and it went too far.   So when I thought about this later, I realized hooking up wasn’t and would never be for me.   When it’s a stranger, it’s impossible to be sure boundaries are kept!   

For you, may I suggest to keep an eye on your recreational drug use.  I have always been a one and done drinker, pretty much due to the fact I loathe the feeling of not being in control.  So perhaps that’s the live and learn part, and you won’t have to blame yourself for anything, because you became a wiser and stronger person, learning from what should not have happened to you.   We do have control over what scenarios we put ourselves into.  There’s nothing you could have done to change it at the time, so avoiding situations like that from here on out is your duty.

You should not compare your successes on a bad day with the successes you had on any other day, or with any other person’s successes for that matter.   Your rating system, of how you’re handling what your going through, should be relative to your experiences overall, and keep fighting the good fight, eventually you may realize you really did win..."

That said, however, the comments about “let people like things” and “you hate change,” are inherently hypocritical because every single person who has ever liked something long-term has experienced at least one change they didn’t agree with over time, number one.  

Another reason it’s not okay to criticize someone’s opinion for either of those reasons is my favorite amendment, “freedom of speech.”  The idea behind freedom of speech (although many seem to have forgotten this) is that we can all learn through intellectual discourse involving our opinions, and it’s better to try to understand all sides of any argument."
