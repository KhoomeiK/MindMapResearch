CPTSD,fjute0j,t3_fez3pk,1583620030.0,"Don't meet a lot of women my age, last time was 5 years ago, coworker who was a couple years older than me. I was slightly intimidated by her at first but as I got to know her I realized she found me intimidating and was jealous of me in some ways. She said I dressed well, carried myself well, and everyone seemed to like me. First time another woman has said such positive things to me.

I started to like her as a friend but soon found out she was sexist, racist, and sleeping with a married man. She's married to a different man now, but I'm in no way jealous of her because I know the person that she truly is.

I've got my own issues, but I'm not a terrible human being like a lot of people are."
antiwork,fjlvoj9,t1_fjkoj1t,1583455530.0,"I grew up being shy around my dad because he was gone working 3-4 months at a time. That's a long ass time for a kid. He was, and still is a stranger to me, 30 years later. 

He enjoyed working because he got to be away from his abusive wife, who raised his kids, who was abusive as fuck to them. Fuck both of them.

I'll never have children or talk to my parents again."
