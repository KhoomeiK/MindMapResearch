relationship_advice,fr5uu2w,t3_gmurc3,1589915035.0,"I mean I hope you're not just this concerned because it's a mental illness because really I guess it should have as much weight put to it as people who have a lot of cancer in their family and still choose to have children. 
If you really don't want the risk then adopt but then of course there's a chance they can have an illness too. 
You cannot avoid some form of mental or physical illnesses being passed along through families I think and there are people with mental health conditions like schizophrenia who live happy lives it is not a death sentence it isn't always as scary or dramatic as movies make it. 
With a lot of mental illness the environment can be a major factor or trigger so if you aimed to raise your kids with love and compassion it can only make  a better life for them anyway. Maybe you could do a lot more research into this and speak to a profession. 
Other than that I feel like your options are really just have your own bio kids or don't but definitely don't raise your own kids in fear they'll have a condition it doesn't make them any less human."
depression,fr5trfw,t3_gmtsy0,1589914529.0,"Maybe this is a sign that you do need a change of job and to put your enjoyment as a priority over other benefits if you are in a position to do that financially etc. 
If any job is making you feel suicidal I would absolutely say it is not worth it and your mind is trying to tell you something. 
Idk if you also have the option to take a break from your work and have some therapy as perhaps that would help too. 
Not everybody can get enjoyment for work and for some people it is a clock in clock out thing but if it's pushing you this far into depression it is worth looking at other options."
TwoXChromosomes,fr5tawa,t3_gmtt25,1589914306.0,It is so bad and I feel like it encourages so many women to fake pleasure and fake orgasms and just sends the wrong message to men that pounding away is how you get all women to orgasm.
AskMen,fr5sn53,t3_gmtt6n,1589913989.0,"I feel like because your kids are so young this is kind of inevitable regardless of your individual situation. 

I think a good way to break up any routine is do different things on different days of the week and plan trips to different places at the weekend. 
In regards to the cooking and chores you could try and get your kids involve and teach them basic skills especially when it comes to cooking young kids can find this quite fun and you'd no doubt get more enjoyment too. 
You could also get your kids involved in your hobbies or get your kids involved in hobbies you can all take part in as a family. 
Another good way to make it feel less like groundhog day would be to get a big wall calendar and write out all the plans for in the week and the weekend and the things you've achieved and done - you could work towards a family project building or making something together and then even when it feels like you've done nothing you can look at the calander or project and be reminded you've done something together as a family. 
I don't know what your situation is like with getting free time to yourself to meet new friends and more people local to your area but joining a sports team or gym would always be a good idea for just a few hours a week to have your own time plus again you'd be getting fitter/healthier or gaining a skill which could add to a sense of achievement."
AskReddit,fr5rcte,t3_gmtt7h,1589913368.0,"I feel like it's really sad when a 40hr week still doesn't provide enough income for people to live a nice life and they're in a dead end job which they can never advance in and it has no enjoyment. 
I worked a really shitty dead end job once when I was desperate and you could see how mental health could get so bad, people were working in silence for hours straight doing a repetitive task which required no concentration and everyone seemed so depressed and drained it was so sad to think people spend 30 years plus of their life doing that not having enough money to go on holiday, not spending enough time with their family just to be a cog in a machine. 
It seems unfair when it's people who have come from a disadvantaged background doing this kind of work and they have no chance to change it or develop another qualification and move up a ladder at all. 
Fair enough if you're working 40 hour plus in your own business/a job you really enjoy where you've got freedom and engagement to your tasks I think that's totally different."
relationship_advice,fr5px8a,t3_gmttan,1589912676.0,"I feel like I've been in this exact situation and it is so hard, I feel your pain! 
It is obvious your relationship is also pretty toxic and you need to get out of there even if it is less toxic than your family situation. 
You don't have to go back to your family there are other options you could live with a friend or flat share etc if you're worried about costs. 
I think ultimately a relationship dynamic like that won't improve and you're wasting your time there but you're just stuck there because you feel like you have no other choice - he probably knows this as well and so has no intention to change his behaviour. 

When you feel alone in a relationship I think it's really a sign that you're better off single because a relationship is suppose to be an addition to your life, not take away."

relationship_advice,fr0dr4k,t1_fqyw872,1589792003.0,"I think paying attention to someones small off comments is really important and the hardest thing. If it is a red flag I feel like you'll have a gut response that won't sit well with you. Another sign of a red flag comment would be them saying something that is actually deeply offensive/rude/incentive and then saying 'I didn't mean it like that' 'you're overreacting' 'it was just a joke'. 
E.g. you've already told this person you were bullied for being fat in elementary school and then some time later they see a picture of you in elementary school and laugh and say 'they're right you were fat' but then they say something along the lines of the things I previously said e.g. 'sorry I didn't meant it like that, you're overreacting' just 100% back away from that friendship/relationship there and then. 
People to avoid are people who say things that mean to hurt you and they're doing it (consciously or subconsciously) to push your boundaries to see how much you'll take so they can keep putting you down and ramping up their comments. 
While cutting all people out who treat you like this is preferable if you're in high school or another environment where you're kinda stuck with these people I'd just advise to cool off the friendships and like I previously said don't be telling them your personal problems or past just keep the friendship to being civil."
relationship_advice,fqyvj8y,t3_glojvg,1589755277.0,"Firstly absolutely do not blame yourself for being sexually harassed, stalked or cheated on - these things are absolutely not your fault and it is wrong that they happened to you. Whilst there is no sure fire way to avoid these things happening again there are some ways you can aim to prevent getting involved with these people hopefully.

This is definitely a situation I can relate to so here is my advice. (They kind of all mesh together but I've tried to be as clear as possible) 

1. Only give out one second chance (if that) - do not keep giving people multiple chances when it comes to bad behaviour do not give people another chance. 
(A thing I found so confusing was being tok forgiving - when someone hurt me I would forgive them thinking I'd expect the same back from them in the future but I kept forgiving them multiple times for their bad behaviour when I had done nothing wrong to them but kept thinking that one day maybe I'd slip up and want forgivenes for something in return but this is not a great way to live and people will exploit you for this as they won't feel the same way)

2. Walk away at the first red flag and this will be early on. 
People ignore red flags in the beginning out of convenience and bias because you want the new friendship/relationship to work but if you listened to the red flags from the start you'll have less sticky situations to deal with later on. A red flag could be a weird behaviour, a harsh comment, or maybe things are suspicious with them and don't add up but you gloss over it thinking they'll either change or it was a mistake - do not do this just leave at the first red flag.

3. Have clear boundaries (I feel like this ties in with the first two) but if people know they can't take advantage of you/if people see you're not a push over then they won't be able to push your buttons/create drama as they know you won't tolerate it and if they're after drama they'll hopefully leave you alone if they see you don't stand for it.

4. Do not mention your previous experiences/past with someone unless you have been with them for a very long time and you absolutely trust them 100%. Especially do not be telling people from the get go as people can exploit this as they know you've accepted bad behaviour in the past. 

5. To avoid being in toxic/dramatic friendships I would avoid people that seem to be obsessed with their appearance/sex/drinking/drugs etc - maybe you could meet people through a sports team/gym/class/hobby, if you find people who have healthy passions and goals and aims for the future they will probably be a good crowd to be around. & avoid those situations where everyones getting drunk, doing drugs, getting with each other as this will no doubt lead to drama

6. Avoid gossiping or wanting to gossip as I feel like this leads to those toxic friendships where it's always about being in other peoples' business 

7. I'd also say see your friends a healthy amount of time don't depend on them fully, don't use them as therapist. Keep a good balance between seeing them/your family and doing other things that are important to you e.g. school/job/hobby whatever. When you start to depend on friends or have a friendship group where everyone depends on each other things can get really messy.

8. To stop appearing to others as a girl with drama just always remain calm, don't react to situations, don't talk about your problems or drama in public and just act mature and laid back - don't let things get to you. 

Lastly I would say you're only 18 and maybe just finding it hard to deal with people which is totally understandable after everything you've been through. I'd 100% ignore the people calling you 'crazy' as you shouldn't listen to what ex friends/ex SOs have to say about you anyway.

Sorry that this was all so negative and instructive but this is my advice I hope it helps."

insomnia,fqwivrm,t3_glc5zy,1589706056.0,"I have had similar issues to this with stress about a relationship meaning I was having 3 hours sleep a night but then anytime I went to drive I'd keep nodding and jerking myself awake too and it was really scary and I did not know how to combat it at all. 
Obviously after I left the guy the sleeping improved 100% so until you do that this would be my advice .
1. Sleep in a different bed/room/house if you can, even sleeping on the sofa would most likely improve your sleeping,
2. If you said you do take naps and can sleep in the day then I'd do as much of that as possible so you are getting in more hours of sleep because the less hours of sleep you have the more paranoid and irritated you're going to be by things anyway
3. If you've found ways to help you sleep I think you mentioned the TV then utilize that (also might relate back to sleeping in a different room), things that helped for me were eye masks, earplugs, the room being totally dark
4. This is good advice for not sleeping in general - do not stress yourself out for your lack of sleep, if you wake up and find yourself unable to go back to sleep DO NOT beat yourself up for it or start mentally spiraling thinking I'm going to ruin tomorrow/ I'm going to crash my car now etc - when you do find yourself awake or unable to go to sleep just relax, stay calm and be really compassionate towards yourself view the fact that you're still in bed and comfortable and lying down as rest and still valid and valuable - maybe read a book or watch TV in a place or position you could still fall asleep again easily if it happens.

I hope this helps"
TwoXChromosomes,fqwh7pt,t1_fqv72e3,1589704303.0,Maybe it's because they don't want to acknowledge the fact the women in porn aren't actually enjoying it - someone did a documentary a few years ago where they got porn addicts and took them behind the scenes of porn and all of them never watched porn again from what they saw.

Absolutely not.
Tell him straight and honest he will no doubt be horrified he's causing you pain/you're not enjoying it just for the sake of him - you just need to tell him straight up and come to a solution together."

relationship_advice,fqsp0rj,t1_fqrj7yi,1589613881.0,"If you have grown up in a dysfunctional family and noticed how much it has hurt you then you really need to get your kids out of their dysfunctional family situation - they are your family, you chose to bring them into this world/this situation and you should really be putting all your energy into making sure they don't live the same life as you - surely you would want to break the cycle? 

I think you've put this high school gf on a god like pedestal - you know nostalgia makes us remember things so differently. You say you didn't fight but guess what you might just not remember this was years and years ago chances are you're remember this with a rose tint. Even if you didn't fight that is not realistic for any relationship past your teenage years. 

Like I said I think you're just using this as a mental escapism out of your current situation but I don't know why you're not more concerned out of getting your kids out of an abusive marriage. 

You don't always have to have the perfect romantic relationship - if you can focus all that effort on having a relationship and connecting/supporting/loving your kids then that will make up for your fuckups of the past. 

Maybe try and flip the situation but say a girl you dated young in your 20s or whatever perhaps she treated you a bit badly- what would you think if this person came to you now and said I've felt cripplingly guilty for years and its ruined all of my following relationships, my marriage and my relationship with my kids. Personally I would think this is a mad thing to say and really is is not about that one person but more about you. Soulmates don't exist, you can make it work with a solid few thousand people as long as you're both secure, compatible and willing to make it work."
relationship_advice,fqso89z,t1_fqrlcmf,1589613137.0,"Yes I agree to keeping it platonic with the new boy I would also say it will probably help if you're single right now because then you don't have an additional factor to add drama or stress you out. 
In regards to being civil around you're ex, I've been in a situation where I've had to spend a lot of time being civil with an ex and I would absolutely say approach everything logically and not emotionally for example if you have to help him with something in class or even pass him a book etc just do it like you would any other person and be completely poker face to the fact he is your ex - do not let your mind go down any nostalgia of the past, do not bring up the past with him in your head/out loud/to others and absolutely do not let anything he says get to you.
In this situation just really keep your head above water and act as mature as you can - if he sees repeatedly he can't mess with you it should set the tone and he should act normal to - if he is immature he might try and really test you to provoke a reaction but this should just prove to you more he's an idiot."

I'd give it a miss and be single for a while to get your head together and as a point don't talk to people in relationships to a point where you start to like-like them and it sounds harsh but dating people who are emotionally a bit of a wreck or recovering from something isn't always a great idea it is usually best to give them space to heal and recover on their own and be a supportive friend and then after time if they've healed then go for it.

You can support both of them and be there for both of them when they're upset. There is absolutely nothing that says you have only agree with one of them and cut the other out. 
I think this situation has upset your sister more because she has been going through a lot recently and I think in normal circumstances this is a forgivable offence. 
I'm ngl but I do think it is an over reaction to be screaming with rage from your friend kissing your brother whilst there were both drunk - I think it will be important to consider they probably did this without thinking and did not know it would hurt her - especially not this much. 
If your brother & her friend didn't know this would have been a betrayal to her then I do not think they've betrayed her - I think most people would see kissing a friends brother a bit risky but whilst drunk most people would probably say it means nothing? So unless she's specifically said in the past if you ever get with my brother I'll I'll deeply hurt then I don't think there is a leg to her argument.

Firstly I think the 'what ifs' thing is partly you beating yourself and doubting your decision but does indicate you're not secure enough to be in a current relationship. 

Ultimately you need to be secure in yourself and your decisions to be happy in a relationship and if you're insecure you will always doubt your decision. 

Going back into a past relationship won't help, I absolutely would not go back there & I'd end things with your current situation as it's not fair on them that you are thinking of someone else.

Sometimes I think the soulmate and star crossed lovers thing is drilled into our heads and we think going back to an ex means it's meant to be and if it a relationship where there was suffering then it's true love but really I think you can make it work if you have any two secure and relatively compatible people.

I think with talking to people via social media it is very easy to get carried away and at the start of ""dating them/seeing them/talking"" whatever you want to call it, the tendency to over do it is heightened by the fact you can see/talk to them constantly with social media and then with lockdown this has had the double effect and maybe this one wasn't meant to be and its just burnt out - I think it is important in the start of talking to someone to limit the interaction else there is a tendency to over shoot it and then have nothing left to say. 
Either way I really wouldn't take this personally or see it as 'I don't understand girls' thing because people do things for a lot of man reasons and 99% of the time it has nothing to do with you.

I think regarding this 'crazy teenage life' thing I think people get really hung up on this but I think maybe you have to ask yourself what is it that you're really wanting because maybe going home a few hours later/ at midnight shouldn't make that much difference on having fun with your friends - I think everyone does get that FOMO feeling at any age and you just have to reassure yourself that you will have other fun times and fun times to come but you don't always have to be at every single thing.
Since your friends/boyfriends parents are less strict obviously this is amplified and probably seems quite intense but really if their parents are giving them too much freedom then it is going to disadvantage them in the long term and/or put them in danger in the short-term.

I think in summary I'd just try to enjoy the time with your friends/boyfriend that you have and if you always have to go in later you could suggest meeting up earlier so that you have more time & I think you have to stop assuming that they're having loads of fun without you because really it might be quite boring but we live in an age where everyone has to look like they're having fun all the time. Maybe if you had a fun hobby or TV series you could really get into when you're at home so that you didn't concern yourself with what they're doing that might help - or maybe even spend time with your family as maybe they're being strict as they don't want to lose you? I dont know - but I do know a few people who did really well in school because of strict parents but are really upset about the fact they missed parties and stuff when really you'll realise those parties weren't that great anyway."

Ultimately I think you just have to accept the situation as I really don't think you can make anyone talk to anyone and you shouldn't be taking on this responsibility or stress.
To be honest I think it seems like your sister has made the right decision for her and in the future she probably will forgive your dad but I think you definitely just need to give her that space and not make her feel worse than she does right now - to choose to cut a parent out is a really difficult decision for anyone even with maltreatment so the last thing she probably wants is another person making her feel guilty or pressured into seeing him again.

relationship_advice,fqri67e,t3_gkjbc4,1589584839.0,"I think people really have the tendency to completely glorify and romanticize their first love - in some cases I really know people idolized them and cannot see past this and compare others to them. Really I just think this is because it was your first experience in love, sex, relationships etc and you're at a time of your life when you had no other real world worries like job/money/house/kids so the ""love"" was very intense and consuming.
I think you'll be surprised at how quickly that illusion will be shattered if you get together now as you're both adults with baggage now and it will not transport you back to high school (not in the long term at least). 
I think if there is kids involved they should absolutely be the priority and nothing is worth messing their life up especially not for your own romantic fantasies. 
Also I don't know what you discussed in therapy obviously but you said you felt so bad for a lot of your life for treating her so badly (or another girlfriend I can't remember sorry) and so you've taken on that guilt for years, I think that guilt is really misplaced and I think there isnt many people who wouldn't be able to say they mistreated people in their early relationships - you were young and hadn't worked stuff out yet so maybe another part of you wants to get back with her because you still feel guilty? Idk but regardless I think you need to let the guilt of the past go and really focus on the present.
Going back to the past isn't going to help you with your current situation. 
If you're in an abusive marriage you should focus on leaving that and focusing on your kids and growing within yourself- if you're getting a divorce you shouldn't be occupied with dating anyway. 
In summary I think you just need to forget about the past and focus on yourself, your kids and your current situation as I think the ex girlfriend thing seems to be escapism into a romanticized high school relationship.

relationship_advice,fqrgv7n,t3_gkjd80,1589584098.0,"I think this is a very clear red flag that he is insecure and this will only build. 
You should absolutely be able to wear whatever you want/whatever shoe you want - you said you love the heels and it would be sad if he ruined this for you."
relationship_advice,fqrgehv,t3_gkjdp7,1589583835.0,"I absolutely don't think you should let your ex ruin a class that you really wanted to take - I think you're just going to have to be super mature and ignore the fact he's there/be civil. 
Also it sounds like a weird dynamic with the new guy 'getting clearance' from your ex? I think maybe stay away from both of those boys if they've talked about you and discussed things it just seems like a weird situation."
relationship_advice,fqrg3hu,t3_gkjdxv,1589583662.0,"It really sounds like he has no positives other than being a 'nice guy's but you really don't have to stay with someone just because they are nice and really it sounds like he takes away from your life more than he gives and is just creating a negative environment. 
I agree with another comment here - he seems immature and like he needs to work on himself. I'd also advise to leave him I don't think he will get better and I don't think you should stick around to help."
relationship_advice,fqrfr7m,t3_gkjf64,1589583469.0,"Personally I also like to remove or block exes as I think it just makes it easier/ less problems. I know some people think it is extreme but I think it makes more sense. They're not apart of your life anymore and you don't need or want to see them so what's the issue. 
I think go for it."
relationship_advice,fqoxxmd,t3_gk4kg0,1589528287.0,"To be honest unless you see this as a problem that you would like to fix because you would like to cuddle people more then I don't think you should aim to change it. 
Some people just have different levels of needing intimacy and in my opinion your SO sounds like she is needing a lot.
I think maybe you have just been with people who are overly intimate because I feel like 3 times a day of long extending and/or spontaneous cuddling really sounds not normal to me but idk I wouldn't think that's 99.9% of women, there are definitely women out there who don't do/want or need this. 
Maybe the women you're with are over shooting it with intimacy because they think you're pulling away? 
But again we can't just sit here and analyse lol.
I would honestly just say take daily intimacy needs into consideration when starting your next relationship and go for someone who is more like you and/or more understanding. 
If you have claustrophobia your SO should be more understanding of that anyway and not call it an excuse."
relationships,fqn6qjc,t3_gjtpwv,1589489605.0,"I think he seems very insecure and way too concerned about your appearance - if he loves you it shouldn't change with the colour of your hair. 
Seems like red flags to be honest that could turn into much more controlling behaviour.
I think it is difficult for anyone of any age in long distance relationships to make it work as you do have to be very secure in yourself and in trusting your partner and he doesn't sound like currently he has the maturity for this. 
Personally I think you should end it as he is displaying red flags here."
TwoXChromosomes,fqn5upl,t3_gjtq34,1589489184.0,"I think this seems like as it doesn't bother him and/or it's not something he even notices he clearly has different standards of hygiene than you - in this situation I feel like you either have to accept that you'll always be doing the cleaning or it is a deal breaker to you and you leave him. 
I think knowing other people who have this problem even when it is discussed and promises are made eventually they'll go back to not cleaning/ doing chores as they will always know you'll just do it. 
If hygiene standards are important to you and a deal breaker it is probably best to consider this before being/living with someone as ultimately the arguments can build - because from his perspective he genuinely might just not see any problem with the mess. 
I personally think this kind of behaviour is trash from him and it should absolutely not be all your responsibility and that you're too young to be spending your life cleaning up after someone else who can't be bothered - but that's just imho."
dating_advice,fqn4hzq,t3_gjtq3g,1589488530.0,"I think in the start of dating anyway it is important to keep a balance of not speaking too much as it may burn out too fast so I would avoid over doing it with calls or facetimes. 

So maybe I'd try to have catch up just in the evenings and ask more varied questions than just how was your day and then have one virtual date (via videochat/facetime) once or twice a week and (I'm not sure what restrictions are/will be like for you) but a date in person where you could meet in an outdoor area and stay 6 ft apart.

I think a lot of people really appreciate planning, effort and thought going into things so maybe when you have virtual dates you could send her recipe ideas and both make the same thing and then cook and eat over facetime, you could both watch the same movie or a TV series you've never seen before and watch an episode every few days, you could do random challenge and activities over facetime like drawing or making something & then ultimately I think just making it clear that you're serious about dating and want it to last would also just be reassuring to her as maybe she's worried you'll lose interest too."
relationships,fqn278o,t3_gjtqb9,1589487426.0,"It is completely normal that this bothers you as your friends are crossing boundaries here - I think you need to speak to them individually and seriously and say I don't appreciate you telling your SO my business it should be between us and if they can't respect that or break your trust again I feel like you have to stop telling them your business. 
As your friends they should be able to respect this and maybe even say to them how would you like it if I discussed your business with someone else if they are struggling but yeah they don't seem like they're being great but maybe they've just not noticed how inconsiderate they've been. 
Unfortunately I feel like sometimes it's a given you know certain friends are going to tell their boyfriends things so it's best to avoid telling them very personal things."
relationships,fqn0v56,t3_gjtqdo,1589486784.0,"I think you have 3 options here - you can just continue ignoring her and she will no doubt get the message eventually if her messages are annoying you you could just mute the conversation, you can tell her look I just don't think we're compatible because of the replying issues so I don't want to talk or you can just block her. She's obviously not the one for you so I'd just keep it moving."
relationship_advice,fqmqh6s,t3_gjorus,1589481798.0,I think it might be a case where he wants to end things so just starts saying mean things randomly in a hope you'll break up with him because he doesn't want to do the dirty work. No one deserves to be spoken to like that and you should leave if this was his intention or not - I feel like the comments will escalate and get worse as he's trying to push boundaries to see how much you'll take.

survivorsofabuse,f8axe2p,t3_dzt0fn,1574417114.0,"I totally get the anger and what you mean but I think if you did this to him you have more to lose.

This probably wouldn't bother him or freak him out he's probably in denial the situation ever happened, he might have suppressed it so much or done it to so many others that he's forgotten. I don't think these people can or ever will get freaked out or scared in the same way unfortunately. 

It fucking sucks their life is unaffected and you feel like its been destroying yours daily, I totally get that but I think staying away from them & having no contact even through false accounts is probably best. Trying to heal and live your best life is a better F you to the abusers. 

You don't know if you message him (even on a fake profile) what he's going to say or do back - there is a much bigger risk of it hurting you more."

rant,f84z3bc,t3_dz0im0,1574264055.0,"On a similar sort of note.
I worked in a workshop for furniture repair - people would pay quite a lot of money to have old stuff done up etc and one woman would bring her dog into work, the dog would piss on the floor daily and sh*t maybe 2-3 times a week inside the workshop instead of being told off the dog was hugged/given a treat and she would use the baby voice and apologise for not taking the dog outside. 

Seemed super wrong to me that the dog was sh*tting inside the workplace if I was someone paying a lot of money I wouldn't want the possibility of a pretty big dog doing its business on my furniture and secondly it always smelt awful and that I'm sure the dog thought it was supposed to sh*t indoors as everytime it did it was hugged and fussed over - basically praised."

AskUK,f77weyf,t3_dumxdx,1573478188.0,"Only have first hand experience for Birmingham & Leeds here.

If weather is important to you it will be the coldest & rainiest in Leeds (although obviously not drastically to the rest of the UK but still). However, as a city Leeds has a lot to offer(I have visited this city a lot due to friends and family however never lived there myself), I think people are very friendly and there is a lot to do there & things are definitely cheaper than the south. It's close to cities like Manchester & Newcastle which are also great. 

I lived in Birmingham for a few years and I have to say it felt so big it was hard to get to know the city. But again it has so much going on & a lot to do always. It isn't a long train  journey to london. It also has really good transport all around the city in terms of trains, trams & buses. 

I'm pretty sentimentality attached to Birmingham but without bias I'd have to say Leeds is a bit more edgy. But i would say they are both pretty similar so it might depend on what other cities or parts of england you want to be closer to - for example if its better you're closer to London for flying back home or whatever."
