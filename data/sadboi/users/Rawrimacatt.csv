narcissism,fdzy2rd,t3_e8wjbq,1578798617.0,"I am in a similar situation. Been in a 6 year relationship with my bf. I love him dearly and thought i was being supportive and doing all the right things but i wasnt. We recently found out im actually a narc and that stems into a lot of the reasons ive hurt him so terribly in the past and hes kinda on his last legs.. regardless of how much we love each other. 

I wish you well, i know its so hard and painful."

Anxiety,f9l3xas,t3_e5adb5,1575413874.0,"I use a liquid sleep aid like ZZZ Quil or Melatonin chewables for my anxious sleep. I have GAD and a Panic Disorder and a pretty high resting heart rate. Dunno if that would be something that would assist you but just wanted to share :) 

I also was originally terrified of my anxiety and panic meds. I however was able to find one and a dosage that worked out for me well enough to even get off my depression medication. You just gotta find what works for you. Its never a cure all, but being able to grab that bull by the horns and at least hold onto it is helpful."
