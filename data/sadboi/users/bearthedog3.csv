My first love was also a very abusive, codependent relationship.

This made me feel indebted to him, for *way* too long and through *way* too much shit.

When I moved in to the house it was full of old charcoal bits and styrofoam. The previous owners had used it as an ash tray was my guess since there were a considerable amount of cigarette butts in it too. I cleared everything out, laid down a layer of medium sized stones, then a layer of peat moss, and then about two monster sized bags of dirt on top of that.

I hated it, because I was *never* hungry, and it was always a struggle to eat as much as they wanted me to. Eventually I asked to trade some of the snacks and meal side dishes with nutritional drinks, because those were just easier for me to get down. But I'll tell you, after about a month of this schedule, I felt my body getting back on track. It felt normal to eat this much, and I even started getting hungry between meals again. Looking back, I knew I never would have been able to fix my eating or hunger cues without being in inpatient. So I'm thankful for that. It wasn't permanent, I did relapse basically right after leaving outpatient, but I think it was an important lesson for me. Im not saying you should check yourself into inpatient, just that it *will* feel wrong to you, in the beginning.

AdultChildren,f3edy0e,t3_dgs3ms,1570871412.0,"I feel for you in your position. I know addiction changes people, and even when they get sober I feel like a lot of sufferers still carry that addiction burden with them every day. It might even be harder for them, despite feeling physically better, because they now have no (or at least, do not have what they might consider to be their most effective) coping mechanism for stressors. Additionally, since alcohol is all around us and not something you can easily forget about (as much as you could ignore heroin or meth, for example) I feel like sober alcoholics are almost forced to be constantly on edge and overly strict with themselves. Maybe your mom found it hard to let up, even when it came to being your parent. 

I resent my mom's sober periods for different reasons. I've watched her attempt sobriety so many times, I'm not even impressed when she hits milestones anymore. I never celebrate. I'm cynical. When anyone asks me if I'm proud I just shrug and say I know it won't last. And it doesn't, which perpetuates my cynical feelings. I'm just tired of that cycle. And when my mom is sober and I can talk to her, she feels fake because she won't address her alcoholism. It's like the only way she stays sober at all for any stretch of time is to completely block it out of her life, so she can't even work on discovering the reason my she feels like she must drink so heavily in the first place. 

Different situations but I still feel for you, for sure. No part of alcoholism is easy, on the sufferer or their dependents/family. Unfortunately I feel like it is a lifelong curse."

houseplants,ezp9in6,t3_d1pmcy,1568036101.0,"That's so funny, I got a head planter too (my only one) and put the exact same plant in it! Do you have any idea what the plant is called though? I never found out and gave it away as a gift."
plantclinic,ezp3zo9,t3_d1q8jk,1568032540.0,"No expert, but if the roots are completely white it likely needs a good soak in water. Not the whole plant, just the root system, and that might possibly bring the leaves back. The good news is it doesn't look diseased, which is what ends up getting most of the orchids I deal with (in a retail store). I've always felt like every other issue was 100% more manageable than trying to win an orchid back over a disease."
houseplants,ezj7lvm,t1_ezhgzyr,1567939969.0,"It is a anthurium, I am just bad at taking care of it! I had it in a low light spot and overwatered it by accident, and lost most of it's leaves and all of it's blooms to rot. I have been letting her dry out and just moved her to a spot with brighter light and am hoping she will bloom for me again!!"
houseplants,ezj7flg,t1_ezg9tza,1567939871.0,"Yes! I have three syngonium and they all were getting pretty leggy and droopy, so I built them all some moss poles and used wire to secure some of their stems to it. They don't really wrap around it or climb it very well but it certainly has helped them stop drooping. I saw a post earlier where someone had their syngonium sitting up on a high shelf and it was hanging down, and it looked really good! I think once they outgrow their poles I will try to hang mine and let them trail like that."
houseplants,ezf7z01,t1_ezf6bgy,1567874189.0,"I've always kept mine indoors. For some reason my green one does much better with the lower light. You can see the purple one reaching for the window. He has always had long and sparse leaves, no matter how many times I prune him or how close to the window I move him. They both flower regularly, although the green one does flower more and obviously retains a more attractive shape. I have kept the purple one for over a year now and it survived the winter just fine indoors. I grew the green one from a few cuttings this spring and was amazed at how fast it became a full plant. They are really rewarding, one of my favorites!"
houseplants,ezf6zor,t1_ezf3fq7,1567873810.0,"I believe it came from Amazon. If you search for A-frame shelves you can find a large selection. The one I got was on the cheaper side so it is a tad bit flimsy, I can't put heavy pots on the edges of the shelves or they will bow, but I definitely saw some really high quality models if you are willing to spend the money!"

houseplants,ezbaz0m,t3_d0lhry,1567817118.0,"Lovely lovely wall mountings, I've always wanted to put up hanging propogation stations! This is probably too big of a question for you to answer thoroughly but *how* did you mount your staghorns?? I have one that is in desperate need of mounting but I have absolutely no idea how. I tried to take it out of it's soil once and got scared because of how jam packed it's roots were. 

Question aside this room is gorgeous, I love the natural light. Great work!"

plantclinic,ez0w406,t1_ez08f16,1567642736.0,"Lol, I work at Kroger in the floral department. Usually our hanging baskets come in overwatered from the warehouse, but there is a good chance someone saw it looking not so good and decided, without checking the soil, to water it to see if that would help. My clerks do stuff like that all the time, breaks my heart."
plantclinic,ez06890,t3_czqg4c,1567631691.0,"I have the same plant and, although not as bad, some of the leaves are definitely curled up like that and I cannot get them to uncurl. Is there a cure to this if they have not been overwatered??"

badwomensanatomy,eyyl3ws,t1_eyyauma,1567592897.0,"Hi, fellow paranoid hypochondriac here so please dont take my words too seriously, but if ibuprofen and asprin are not getting rid of your period cramps, there is a chance you could have endometriosis. Although that is certainly not the only symtom and of course only a doctor can diagnose you, it's something I recently thought I might have so I did a lot of looking into it. Cramps unreleivable by pain killers and cramps that have increased in pain over time are some of the biggest indications of the condition."
insaneparents,eywqv5t,t1_eyw5yo4,1567535807.0,"Yup. I had both parents incarcerated at the time I was trying to file for aid. No mercy whatsoever, they said it was no excuse for not being able to obtain their signatures/ info."
houseplants,eyvqxcw,t1_eyv40ox,1567508160.0,"I got it from a local nursery as just a tiny vine with a few leaves. I've never had a marble queen pothos that was so predominantly white though. I've read that the more light you give them, the lighter their variegation will be, but I honestly haven't ever done anything special for mine to grow this way. I just had her on a windowsill for a year and recently moved her to this shelf when I moved into a new house. I must have just been lucky to get a predominantly white variegated vine."
EatingDisorders,eypgyo6,t3_cy2k6u,1567299801.0,"I had a really bad experience in inpatient too. The structure of the ward seemed really poorly put together, I would switch doctors constantly, I was held in the ward way longer than I should have been and a doctor straight lied to my face. It was very sketchy. I think especially for juveniles, there is not much adequate and even less good treatment options for eating disorders. It's sadly just an area that has little medical research or widespread treatment options. And they are especially not organized, where they do exist. Your experience is not abnormal, unfortunately. I feel for you. I struggled for many years after inpatient. It is certainly not a magical cure all.

The most important thing for you to do is focus on yourself right now. I wish I could offer more specific advice but truly you are your worst enemy, but also your best help. Try to learn to turn the mean voice inside yourself into a positive one, or at least to tune it out. 

Don't give up, try not to feel discouraged. The journey to recovery is rough and bumpy. Good luck friend, sending hugs and good vibes your way."
