infj,fm3s2b3,t3_fqzf5r,1585734856.0,"Same. I love regularly connecting with others on a deep level but find most activities to be more enjoyable on my own. To me, being alone isn't inherently lonely. Loneliness comes from being misunderstood, lack of validation, etc. I think most of us are craving connection right now though. Time spent in isolation has definitely highlighted the downside of me keeping such a tiny, almost non-existent circle."
Anxiety,fm3podh,t3_frslfn,1585732298.0,"Came to this sub for this exact reason. I am experiencing a heightened sense of anxiety due to not being able to get the reassurance I need in isolation. Tonight my anxiety was triggered by a group text gone poorly. I loathe group texts but this one was unavoidable (work). I made a comment that was ignored by the group. It made me want to die a thousand deaths. Yes, that sounds dramatic but I'm telling ya, it's the isolation talking. I can usually get over something like this in a few hours, maybe a day, because I know I'll see or talk to that person, read their tone and/or body language, and be able to rationally assess the situation. Not having these regular opportunities kills me. I know I'm approaching week 3 of isolation and being extra hard on myself though. I think we are all under stress learning how to adapt to these new ways of living and it's exhausting on many levels. Isolation does weird things to the brain. This won't last forever though. Try to be kind to yourself, don't believe the lies your brain is telling you, and maybe talk to someone who understands. You're not alone!"
