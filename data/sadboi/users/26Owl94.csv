JordanPeterson,fkqed0h,t3_fjrbxh,1584442616.0,"Honestly it’s a struggle.  I really thought i was heading that forward direction and then end up injuring myself which I used for the excuse to go back to smoking weed. It’s real hard getting out of this ditch when the dirt used to step on starts to bury you.  

Though admittedly reading over this simple sentence reminds me when one find something meaningful it can definitely illuminate the way along a dark path.  Sorry I’m just babbling none sense to any who would read.  

Best days ahead."
SuicideWatch,fciyj0w,t1_fcfjy1e,1577672893.0,Life milestones I suppose.  Knowing that I’m way behind that I’ve impeded my progress and have done nothing but just allow my life to unravel.  At such a young age i knew what I’ve always wanted to do. And when i lost job i drank even more and add the lost of my grandfather that yr due to drug abuse piled on me.  On top of which i had quit school to focus on my job ironically before i was let go.  And lastly my close friend was and probably still is suicidal and at one point was taking advantage of our friendship thru gaslighting and now i dont want to look like him.  This happened four almost 5yrs ago and I’m just stuck. What makes it all the worse is my mind justifies me not trying anymore.  Honestly if my mom wasn’t who she was i would be on the streets selling myself
JordanPeterson,fc515jk,t1_fc4z6cq,1577437767.0,I think I’m definitely at that point.  I constantly put myself down quicker than i can even come up with anything remotely positive. It’s rather disappointing because ppl had high hopes for me in my family i just suck at life ya know.
