- I don't know what you mean by ""if women want autonomy over their own bodies"" - that's again, thinking that they need to/are required to adhere to some sort of moral code which someone gets to decide - which again, is bonkers. That's also putting women in a inferior and subservient position to men. 

And all women should have autonomy over their body - they don't need anyone else to ""decide"" that just like no one else should. 

Now, to your earlier point : 

That's why I added emphasis on quality education. Most people do mess up - I do agree, and then they have no choice but to face the harsh consequences.


At the same time, the moment you decide to enforce your will on another, and take away their right to choose, that is also something which is messed up. 

Now, if there was a society in place which could take care, provide and ensure stability for victims of assault and those faced with an unexpected pregnancy (some of whom may wish to give birth) then that would be ideal. (Of course this isn't including those who don't want to give birth) So, establishment of such structures will make it far more easier for them. 

However, we do not have that in place and hence people do resort to other options and well, unless we are doing something to directly help them - then that's their choice. You can't complain if you aren't doing anything  directly to help them. 

It's a horrid situation but one which has evaluated fairly which includes taking the mothers choice into account as well.

I mean, obvious refusal aside, there might be health complications to the mother which might leave no option but abortion as well. Now how do we solve that dilemma? 

That's why just follow the middle way. Take everything into account. 

If you can help a person who might want to give birth but cannot due to constraints then pro life people must be willing to do everything to help.

conspiracy,fpn24r6,t1_fpn10gb,1588747910.0,"What your saying is ludicrous as that's something which no one can answer objectively as that is something no one can agree on given the religious, political and other dimensions to this whole debate. And that's also the reason why people start choosing the wrong people and wrong doctrines to follow - in which individuals choice and rights are taken away for the greater 'good' regardless of what they feel about and during which power almost always ends up with the oligarchs.

No can can agree on this topic and that is why you need democratic platform where everything is weighed on all counts along with the individual's right to choose if they themselves want to undergo the result of a process of something they didn't choose. 
Not pro abortion but PRO CHOICE.

Again, the very reason why people get triggered is because of such deep conditioning. 

And that's is why I said - after you've presented and educated the mother to be in time and then it's her choice. About what help she can expect, if adoption is an issue and her own future. 

Anyone saying anything else (who gets to decide etc) is basically mandating that women do not have a right to their own bodies especially if the person doesn't want to undergo. And if you are pushing for other people to be pro life then you better make sure they have a solid reason to follow you in the real world where they will be responsible for a life and where a child might have to face a lot of neglect if given into the system. 

I'm pro life, but I totally understand that my view doesn't have to be anyone elses. I personally do not like the thought of abortion but the world is a messed up place when you force someone to have child which they don't want to have.
Many factors shape  the outcome and that is why you need to educate people first. 

And most importantly, it is a person's right to refuse should they wish to."

Later commentators have compared these accounts with similar ones from Greek and Latin sources speaking of the offering of children by fire as sacrifices in the Punic city of Carthage, a Phoenician colony. Cleitarchus, Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch all mention burning of children as an offering to Cronus or Saturn, that is to Baal Hammon, the chief god of Carthage. It has been suggested that the practice of child sacrifice may have been exaggerated in Roman post-war propaganda in order to make their arch-enemies seem cruel and less civilized.[8]

Cleitarchus' paraphrase of a scholium to Plato's Republic has a description of the practice which predates the fall of Carthage in 146 BC:

There stands in their midst a bronze statue of Kronos, its hands extended over a bronze brazier, the flames of which engulf the child. When the flames fall upon the body, the limbs contract and the open mouth seems almost to be laughing until the contracted body slips quietly into the brazier. Thus it is that the 'grin' is known as 'sardonic laughter', since they die laughing. (trans. Paul G. Mosca)

Diodorus Siculus (20.14):

There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire.

Diodorus also relates that relatives were forbidden to weep and that when Agathocles defeated Carthage, the Carthaginian nobles believed they had displeased the gods by substituting low-born children for their own children. They attempted to make amends by sacrificing 200 children of the best families at once, and in their enthusiasm actually sacrificed 300 children.

Freeman in The History of Sicily from the Earliest Times (1894) states that the Carthaginian nobles had acquired and raised children not of their own for the express purpose of sacrificing them to the god. The author states that during the siege, the 200 high-born children were sacrificed in addition to another 300 children who were initially saved from the fire by the sacrifice of these acquired substitutes.[9]

Plutarch wrote in De Superstitione 171:

... but with full knowledge and understanding they themselves offered up their own children, and those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds; meanwhile the mother stood by without a tear or moan; but should she utter a single moan or let fall a single tear, she had to forfeit the money, and her child was sacrificed nevertheless; and the whole area before the statue was filled with a loud noise of flutes and drums that the cries of wailing should not reach the ears of the people.

The 12th-century Rashi, commenting on the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7:31) stated:

Tophet is Moloch, which was made of brass; and they heated him from his lower parts; and his hands being stretched out, and made hot, they put the child between his hands, and it was burnt; when it vehemently cried out; but the priests beat a drum, that the father might not hear the voice of his son, and his heart might not be moved.

A rabbinical tradition attributed to the Yalkut Shimoni[10] says that the idol was hollow and was divided into seven compartments, in one of which they put flour, in the second turtle-doves, in the third a ewe, in the fourth a ram, in the fifth a calf, in the sixth an ox, and in the seventh a child, which were all burned together by heating the statue inside."

Buddhism,f5sh0v7,t3_doqctg,1572429988.0,"Differences (me/other, negative,  positive) exist to the conventional mind, and while we acknowledge that, it's more about not concentrating on the negative factors of said differences while balancing the important parts which make practising and living in virtue easier. Openly promoting secretarianism - which by itself is more negative isn't wholesome as it clearly draws one back into the ego game and samsara. There are different paths, but which part one is drawn to is a result of one's karma. And if said path is benefiting them and they are not doing anything evil in the broad sense,  then there is nothing wrong. You can advise as long as its welcomed, but slandering other paths (whose main principles are not negative) is just wrong. Cos you aren't a Buddha so you aren't omniscient so how can you say you are totally correct and prove it?  

- hence why we follow the teachings of the Buddha and try not to do wrong. We ourselves aren't at that level to do anything more than control ourselves first and try, if we can, to help others. Getting embroiled in stuff which we can not even ascertain is highly problematic. 

Better to keep a clear mind and the higher picture than get involved in skirmishes of furthering/promoting the ego which will inevitably pull you - or worse,  others down."

Buddhism,f3t0xai,t3_bk1xml,1571114644.0,"As a relatively new buddhist, I want to express some of my thoughts. 

It's a very strange issue as the 101st ganden tripa  and trijang choktrul rinpoche also do and endorse this practice. I listen to tsem rinpoches teachings,(along others) and I find them very valuable for a beginners pov. 
Both sides have given arguments and counter arguments and from a neutral pov I say it's up-to the practioner themselves. As, many cite that they cannot give up the practice as it was passed down by their gurus and in most cases their gurus aren't around to be consulted on whether to give up the practice or not. (guru Samaya, tantra rules) 
Breaking commitments in tantra is a no go in any case. 
Also, I do find the hate against them highly perturbing to say the least. I mean, you can just ignore them or separate from them,  but why the excessive hate?  People have been kicked out of monasteries and attacked on some cases for not giving up the practice.

They are caught between two impossible extremes, and I can't even imagine what they must be facing. No one wants to be called a demon worshipper or seen as anti dalai lama. Of course, violence and slandering from both* sides should definitely be avoided for sure. Essentially, I do understand this is a very controversial decision but in the end it's a matter of personal faith and a person's interpretation of their guru samaya. Some people may wish to give it up, but find themselves in an impossible place as they do not have the authority to do so... 

If you don't agree, isn't it better to separate? I have seen both arguments and found this controversy very strange.
But everywhere I see online, these people are pelted with such overwhelming vitriol. I say this an a non Tibetan and after observing both sides.  DS lamas and practioners are basically outcasts in every sense. It's jarring, to see.

Both sides have aggressive people who should not act out with hate and anger, but practice patience and understanding for the other. I mean, as an outsider, I do understand that this is a gelugpa issue, but again, nothing about ridicule, hate and slurs are Buddhist practices. It's very off putting to see people act like this and makes one wonder just what the hell is going on. Whatever the issue, actions speak louder than words. If they manifest in segregation, violence, hatred and anger from any side - how are these in any way Buddha's teachings? Plus, negative and positive,  like and dislike all stem from the conceptual mind no? If the practioners maintain that it's manjushri, then what is the difference? By making people question and believe that they are demon worshippers and doubt everything... That's scary tbh.

Same goes for those ds practioners who are casting slurs against the dalai lama and are promoting the cultivation of negative attitudes. 

True practioners would just agree to disagree politely right? People are hating on lamas and degrading like they are satanists or something. 

I mean no offense to any side. I genuinely wish that people wish no harm to each other."
