The dog doesn't associate you with anything positive and will act as such. If you positively reinforce good behavior, ie praising or treating when he's friendly or gives you guys space, then he'll continue to do those behaviors. If you give him treats when you see him, he'll associate you with treats. They are incredibly simple creatures who are a product of what's around them. Good luck."
