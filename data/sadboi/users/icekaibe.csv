sleep,fk8e8ul,t1_fk8cbbu,1583954421.0,"Totally. For health related problems and even problems in general I'm finding it's best to deal with things holistically. Most things are not black and white and often require a variety of changes in our thoughts and behavior. It's really the same as someone who's dieting to lose weight. It doesn't take just one big action but multiple small actions throughout the day that promote health and weightloss. THC is just one factors of many, not getting enough exercise is another, caffeine consumption could be another, racing thoughts at night can be another. Try to find as many habits you have that might be inhibiting sleep onset and replace them with good habits that promote sleep onset. Everything you do is either helping or hurting, anything you can do to be proactive is only going to help you.. Be patient, apply things one at a time so you can really measure progress. Progress not perfection. I believe in you lol good luck."
sleep,fk8btgy,t1_fk89hjb,1583953128.0,"Hard to say. Withdrawal and what works for you or anyone else can vary based on many factors. All I can say is that if I was in your situation I would abstain for a period of time so you can really narrow down how THC and withdrawal affect you and your sleep. It's just so much easier to do when you're abstaining altogether and takes away a lot of the variables/guessing work that smoking occasionally would hassle you with. Maybe withdrawal is causing you insomnia, or maybe isn't (though there is a VERY good chance it is). You'll only be really able to find that out by abstaining for a bit and getting over the withdrawal symptoms. Also worth a post over at r/petioles , they have some really smart people and the audience has a wider variety of experiences. I'd say they are also generally less biased than the r/leaves and r/trees subreddits"
sleep,fk887d8,t3_fh0fgz,1583951193.0,"\>  I also smoke quite a bit of marijuana and have for 10+ years and recently have been cutting back SIGNIFICANTLY due to just wanting to better my life. Is it possible my body has become so reliant on the amount of weed I was smoking that now it forgot how to get to sleep without it? Now that it's getting a fraction of the THC consumption in a ""normal"" day it's messing up my sleep pattern? I now only smoke in the evening but even then, less than I was a few weeks ago.

This could be it. You could be going through minor THC withdrawl. One of the most if not THE most prominent symptom is insomnia aka difficulty sleeping. When I quit THC I cannot sleep for 2-4 days afterwards but my habit is not as ingrained as yours would be as a 10 yr smoker, so don't use me as a comparison. For me after those 2-4 days of completely abstaining and making sure to be diligent w sleep hygiene (getting exercise (MAJOR key for me), good diet habits, limiting screen time and other stimulating activities before bed etc.) my sleep goes back to better than it was with THC which has been shown to inhibit REM sleep. I would encourage you to look into the r/leaves and r/petioles subreddits as they have some good info about what you may be experiencing in terms of withdrawl so you can see if your symptoms match up."

Upwork,f46xjau,t1_f46vczj,1571414699.0,"I do agree. For me though I didn't have trouble moving away from UpWork once I had a few core clients after a year or so.

I guess the stipulations here would be that this isn't my full-time income, and I had the benefit of having long-term clients, though I made sure when I started to specifically scope these out similar to op. No terms were broken since all initial projects were completed on UpWork, once I decided to go on my own I let my clients know and they followed me there. I haven't had issues with payment but I could see if this was the case for you why you'd be apprehensive about it, though I do believe there are precautions you could take to ensure this doesn't happen.
