BPD,evdupf6,t3_cjd06w,1564447969.0,This kind of made me....realize a lot.   I always sit in a depressed state but My mind is constantly moving.   I always tell my FP that I need to relax and they say “all you do is relax”  but it’s really just perpetual daydreaming and dot connecting and theorizing and noise.  I sit and think about everything I’ll do to make my life better.
BPD,eu93az9,t3_ceykzo,1563570698.0,Yes.  This happens. I will come back to reality and not even remember what I was gazing at during my daydream.  I used to think I was just “making my life a music video” in my head to the songs that were playing around me but it turns out I was just escaping into another world.  The hypotheticals and the almosts.  The would’ves and couldves.

Feminism,eu8qgqj,t3_cf7va7,1563562424.0,"When I was a sophomore in high school, I lied to a man I met and said that I was 17 years old.  He was 23 and in the army.   We were intimate, he told me he loved me.   I won’t ever forget him taking me to this Olive Garden restaurant and telling me that he was being deployed.  We carried on for a while when he was overseas but I eventually told him I was 15 years old thinking that it would be my ticket out.  It was summertime and I wanted to go to the pool and hang out with my friends, not chat on Facebook and webcam.   He told me he loved me regardless.   I was 15 years old.   I think about the things we did together.  The things he participated in with me and...he had to know I was lying.   He had to know I was a child.  I’m 28 now and I have a brother who is 14.  His friends come over to the house and I see the girls just a year younger than I was.  They are chidren* 

Years later he told me that 99 out of 100 times he masturbated, he was thinking of me.  The child.

BPD,eu4us5j,t3_ceppis,1563463672.0,"I struggle with this.  My partner is amazing and well aware of my issues.  I try to find strength in the hard moments to be wrong.   To stop spinning the web and just say I KNOW ITS IRRATIONAL BUT HERE I AM. Forcing those moments.  Forcing the habits to change.  Asking for isolation when it is the last thing I want because if I am alone, who can I control but myself.  Reflecting hard and honestly.  Not buying my own bullshit and just accepting that I have the option to communicate. To be vulnerable.  To be alone.  

It takes changing habits and being uncomfortable but it’s possible.  Understand that the responsibility is yours and find empowerment in knowing that you are capable."

I always venture into my mind and get stuck on specific people and circumstances I can’t change.  I recently just stopped letting myself “check” on those people...remove them as far from my mind as possible.   They still exist in some thoughts, more than I’d like to admit....but I’m aware and I just tell myself “they aren’t that great, this is my BPD, there is an explanation” it helps a little bit.   I also try to see myself from the eyes of people that love and value me.  People who rely on me.  In your tough moments, try to see yourself from the view of your children and hopefully that helps.  Being aware is the hardest part to get to.  You’re doing great."

It’s never fun to recognize that you’re wasting your energy in places that doesn’t deserve it.  And I hope you can understand that while I relate and empathize with your desire to help them, you haven’t been presented the problem on a platform that enables you to do so. 

The best way to help the community you are speaking about is to donate time, energy, love and money into those with the same issue who live locally.

Does the club they were at have a cover?  Have you ever been out on a Tuesday? Maybe they have alternative work schedules and Tuesday is their Friday. The emphasis on Tuesday is illogical, stop. 

Your inability to recognize the underlying bias in your words and tone leads me to believe that you aren’t educated on the history of this nation.

mentalhealth,es6oz4q,t3_c60uul,1561654171.0,"Hi friend.  I'm going to reply to your original question because that's the only thing that deserves your energy.  When my partner and I got together, we immediately realized that \*we\* both suffer from MY anxiety and depression.  He was as supportive as he could be, but I don't think he understood where the feelings came from.  My emotions are abrupt and unconcerned with surroundings or timing.  He often felt like I was intentionally setting myself off to gain ground in an argument.  It sucked but I had to be the one to initiate the conversation.   I would say things like ""how can I communicate my feelings better to you?"" ""how does my anxiety make you feel?"" Opening up the conversation and giving your partner the opportunity to share their feelings first often gives them the mental space to acknowledge that there are two parts to the equation.  Often, I feel like our partners feel trapped by the responsibility of our emotions without the freedom of truly controlling the outcome.  I hope that this helps you"

I derive ZERO energy from being around others - it's actually quite the opposite.  Finding ways to draw boundaries and holding myself to those boundaries has been the test of my life.  But, I no longer have the label of a flake - I'm just the friend who would rather be at home....alone :)"

You're a really strong woman and I hope that you know that.  I want you to feel better.  For me, feeling better usually requires some kind of emotional release.  Creativity comes in many shapes, sizes, mediums.  It could mean creating a playlist for your flight and finding new artists that allow you to channel this angst or it could mean you doodle in a journal.   It could be collecting interesting soda cans you find on the street or making bracelets for the people that mean something to you.  The options are endless.   So often we think of grief and loss as this soul-sucking madness that has to be shoveled somewhere else....I say, HARNESS IT.  Use that energy and pain to create something that could not exist in any other moment.  Be brave and understand that we can feel freely without the weight of permanency.   It is all fleeting, babe.  Please reach out to anyone, even me, if you start to feel suicidal.  You aren't alone."

So, thank you for clarifying what a ""sane"" member of society would do but that doesn't seem to apply here.  Your argument here is pretty troublesome.   Comparing the two crimes is inherently wrong.  Bringing up black-on-black crime has literally nothing to do with this.   The black community is and continues to be outraged by brothers killing brothers, sisters killing sisters.  Jussie Smollet?  Again, you're grasping here.  The ""white man"" this woman is referring to is the same ""white man"" that allows dogs to be homed in places of poverty, places where affordable animal care is not readily available.  The ""white man"" that takes away adequate mental health care.   I understand your point - there is no excusing this behavior.  But fuck, are you that angry at this man that you cannot understand the underlying issue here?  The way this dog's life ended was terrifying.  But a family losing their father over this is arguably worse for society.  Mental health issues and our inability to support those who suffer is the argument here.
