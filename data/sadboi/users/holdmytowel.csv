millionairemakers,fqsh94m,t3_gkjiqo,1589607224.0,Hello I am a struggling college student. :)
adhdmeme,fqa43ej,t1_fppue42,1589212463.0,"I tried to read it, but after getting about halfway ADHD brain was like “no more want”

I totally just stopped reading your comment without realizing it too! 

But I appreciate the effort you put into getting info out there. :)"
ADHD,fqa05cp,t3_ghikbt,1589210406.0,"Medication helps correct the neurochemical imbalances of ADHD, but not brain structure. You’ll find that you can focus better and will be better at taking action, but unlike neurotypicals you will still lack the ability to be self-aware of what you are doing majority of the time. 

So it’s important to back up medication use with mindfulness practice, to help build that awareness. 

Enjoy and embrace what medication does! But don’t be like me and slip on symptom management because you feel like your ADHD is cured. :)"
bipolar,fpuyebk,t3_fxmuy0,1588928152.0,I imagine this would look amazing with a clear and glossy resin on top too! It would add that “depth” you feel me?
GetStudying,fpuy2s1,t1_fpuumog,1588927807.0,"I have ADHD too, and agree that music generally doesn’t help me focus. When working, I can’t listen to anything with lyrics and/or too “intense” —  EDM and quickly paced classical music falls into that category.

However if the work isn’t challenging enough to keep my attention and I start getting bored, I opt for chill Lo-Fi beats and colored noise: white, brown, etc.

Also, a better alternative to studying on Facetime for people with ADHD, is to study over discord. My friends and I video chat and study while keeping ourselves “deafened,” so we don’t hear any noises from others in the chat. 

It’s also important to be selective with who you study group with, avoiding those who’ll constantly want to talk and derail your attention."
ADHD,fnrgxa5,t3_g3enb2,1587188609.0,"I have a lot of intrusive thoughts! However besides occasional depressive episodes, I generally have no comorbidities with my ADHD. 
Regularly my intrusive thoughts are about food, cute things, and fun distractions. 

But when I’m in “ADHD Rage Mode”, I get intrusive thoughts about what’s made me mad and methods to punish and/or get rid of the annoyance.

:-[  It’s a battle to take a step back and logic the anger away. Growing up, I was pretty toxic and abusive towards people around me because I lacked a diagnosis and knowledge of how to calm myself. Took being an “angry teen” to the next level."
