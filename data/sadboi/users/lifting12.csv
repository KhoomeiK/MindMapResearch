sarmsbible,fklgu6d,t3_fj0nvy,1584306009.0,12 weeks is a great amount of time. I wouldn't take for more then 6 months without a break. One reason is because it could lead to insulin resistance like the other poster stated. The other is because it's been shown to have a diminishing return effect in studies. There appears to be a desensitization after a period of time.
Sarms1,fkkx68p,t1_fkkwn0c,1584293818.0,It's possible yes. Even if you're on TRT you probably produce at least some T naturally.

Shoulder injuries are notorious for not healing properly so do it right the first time. There's also some good data to support the fact that if you continue to work out the uninjured side of your body that your injured side will retain/gain more muscle because your body tried to balance itself out.

Copper peptide is supposed to help with skin, but not acne necessarily. The best things you could do for acne would be proper topicals such as retinol, benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Never use retinol and benzoyl at the same time.
Orally you could either go the natural or chemical route or a combo. Natural would be eliminating trigger foods for acne; usually dairy and sugars and focusing on gut health. Chemical would be minocycline, spironolactone or accutane. 
If it's really bad (cystic) it's so worth it to see a derm and get on the right stuff."
sarmsbible,fkjcc46,t3_fit1ig,1584241906.0,Ostarine might help with healing a bit. I'd definitely use BPC and TB-500 as far as peptides go. You could also do PRP injections or prolozone to speed healing as well.
