cults,fial61z,t1_fiakvme,1582303315.0,"Iiiiiinteresting. It was always presented to me as, yes Christian, but it's own brand. And they tried everything to make the separation seem more distinct"
cults,fiak3el,t3_f7cvvg,1582302678.0,"Ex Mormon here. While the members don't view it as culty, they also consider themselves an entirely different religion from general Christianity. The doctrinal systems are derived from Christianity but with pieces of Masonic rites, Egyptian bastardization, and even pieces of the spiritual movement (like theosophy). They'd never admit to any of that and would call themselves a separate religion.

To sum up though: Very culty. Very controlling. Very manipulative. And damn near impossible to leave."

Its like sensory deprivation and I've never been happier to work out. Dunno if that helps. Otherwise, headphones and music and kindness to yourself."
exmormon,ffr9bjh,t3_eupg7g,1580153264.0,"That is unbelievably unprofessional. You should absolutely demand a refund. Don't give up on therapy though. It can really be effective in easing your pains. You could try an app like talkspace too. I have specifically requested therapists (app and in person) who are not religious or help to deal with religious trauma. You don't need a preachy asshole making everything worse.

Also, the folks on this sub are always willing to help. Myself included. I'm not a therapist, but I've been there. PM if you need someone to talk to."

exmormon,feygmj9,t3_eqrtb2,1579445259.0,So familiar. My mom showed up at my house and took me on a drive that turned out to be an intervention. I lost my job because she kept me in a place with no cell reception for 3 days while we talked about Jesus and chastity. In glad you stood up to your mom.

Anxiety,ey805po,t3_cw3c7w,1566907366.0,"I worked in finance for a year and completely get your distaste for the capitalism hypocrisy. It's definitely hard to stomach.

Make a pro/con list for staying at your job then make one for doing your project zero. See how it balances. Then do what YOU want to do.

Alternatively....you could look for a job in a different industry. Not all companies are 100% evil. I just left the finance industry and my new job is much less gag-inducing."
