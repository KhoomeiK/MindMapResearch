worldpolitics,f8timb6,t3_e2115y,1574804164.0,"The democrat / republican divide is very interesting from a systems perspective. Let me lay out some logical conclusions and if you disagree with them for logical reasons let me know why. I'm persuadable. I will even give this an edit here -> (this spot) if you prove me wrong.  


First, either party has had enough of a majority at different times that they could force any law through. So if they didn't pass a law for something the party ""agrees"" on then it dosn't really agree.  


Secondly: Campaign contributions rather than voter preference overwhelmingly determine the outcome in Washington.  


Thirdly: Republicans overwhelmingly receive more large campaign contributions than Democrats. They are also the party accused of having the most outside assistance (Just ask any boomer yelling at someone and claiming they are a russian bot)  


Lastly: Despite the amazing tactical advantage to the democratic party rank and file if they banned large contributions, given that republicans simply receive more, Democratic leadership is firmly against this and calling for it is a sure way to get smeared because while mega donations hurt the party as a whole they help leadership stay in power and control the rest of the party.  


So either side could pass laws to block online botting and external interference in elections (and a law doing this is blocked in the house by Pelosi, currently). Either side could have also passed the ""No More Arming Terrorists"" act that forbids our intelligence agencies from arming or training foreign terrorists. Either side could impeach members of the executive branch (it's not just for presidents) who lied us into Iraq or who refused to prosecute baby Bush for war crimes.  


And they haven't, so (except for the few members who have been smeared by the media after calling for these things) they don't want to.

&#x200B;

Structurally Republicans are less likely to be corrupt as they have more ""true believers"" - be it in Libertarianism, Alt-Right ideology, Laissez faire capitalism, or Evangelism - who see the money as a tool to win that makes sense to accept. But their ideas are also so far outside the mainstream and affect certain minority groups so negatively that it makes it possible for an entrenched, intelligent, and corrupt DNC leadership to maintain a rough balance that prevents anything but tax cuts for the wealthy and the budget for more wars from going through.

&#x200B;

Ultimately this is unsustainable as the republicans get more and more ""fringe"" representatives in their party, the DNC leadership gets more corrupt and out of touch, and more and more people suffer the result of both these things. We are seeing that now. The hope is that the systems in place can provide a way to fix these problems before they break it entirely. Fix it or watch it break are the two options long term, as temporary relief would only lead to the system reaching a point of crash again."

Libertarians: We aren't getting any services that are of value to us from government, they should stop taxing us. (Instead of wasting it on wars, corruption, and a bloated prison industrial complex.)

Progressives: If we have playing taxes we should get what we pay for, and if some goods can't be provided ethically by the private market that's where we should step in. (Instead of wasting it on wars, corruption, and a bloated prison industrial complex.)

There's actually some surprising crossover there, and even if you are heavily for one I think it's easy to see that the other one would be better than what we currently have. (Wars, corruption, people locked up for things that shouldn't be crimes.)"

Yogscast,exq2z7i,t3_ca6ylr,1566497269.0,"I know this comment won't make a difference, but it reminds me of this character I really liked so I thought I would say it once.

There was this character Sjin, played by a guy who kinda based the character off himself (to some extent) but whose name I don't even remember.

The character was cool and enjoyed building, and when people started getting lazy or cheating he did amazing trolls. He never said that was why he did it, but as long as people were engaged and working together he almost never did, when he got bored or they messed with a build he went full ham. It kept things lively.

Given the public information avaliable the actor (Paul something? I'm probably wrong) definitely acted very unprofessionally, in a way that reflected a deep lonliness and a bit of pure stupidity, and got caught up in the wave of the yogs CEO being a predatory bastard and canned.

People had a strong reaction for or against. Either they felt betrayed by Sjin or like it couldn't be true at all and rushed to his defense.

But Sjin is imaginary, and you don't know the guy that plays him.

I liked the character and I'm disappointed his actor didn't get the chance to learn and grow from his mistakes because someone who produced great content that I liked got booted out the door.

But I'm aware there may be more behind the scenes that I don't know about, or UK liability laws I'm not aware of, so it is what it is.

Still, I will miss the character (and I doubt anyone else could play him right.)"
