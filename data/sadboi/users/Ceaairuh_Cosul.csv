depression,f9mwxnv,t3_e5q279,1575472082.0,"I cope by making a lot of depression, suicide, and self deprecating jokes. During the day, with my friends, I’m good at bottling things up and can feel genuine happiness, but the anxiety or knot in my chest never goes away. It’s more so that my happiness with my friends is fragile and any small thing can set off depression"

depression,f813ubi,t3_dyazjo,1574148815.0,I feel you. I want to die but it scares me and committing suicide is hard so I would like an accident to take me out of the picture for a few weeks-years
mypartneristrans,f7n16n2,t1_f7n15h8,1573880358.0,I totally understand that. 100%
mypartneristrans,f7myaw0,t1_f7muplx,1573877537.0,"I’ve been feeling like the things my gf values are things that I hate about myself. I hate my boobs. I hate that I have to shave my legs. I hate sitting and dressing “lady like.” I hate having curves. My partner keeps telling my I’m lucky and beautiful, but they’re transition is making me feel like less of a female. And in a way it’s a little bit of jealousy because they can fit into being female. They can wear dresses and make-up and feel normal why can’t I? 
I definitely feel what you are saying about internalized objectification. I feel very much the same way as you do."
aaaaaaacccccccce,f7dls2u,t1_f7dlo36,1573620638.0,They wouldn’t believe me. They’re open and all but... know I’ve had sex. Or at least did before i knew it was okay to not want it.
mypartneristrans,f7dklko,t3_dvlo5p,1573619565.0,Tell him how you feel. My gf is going through the same thing and I keep trying to treat them how they wanted to be treated but they snap and get mad and I feel upset all the time because I know I can’t help. I feel like my very existence defies their new found feminism. I told them this and they apologized for snapping because they realized I was just doing what they asked of me and said exactly what was wrong and our relationship has been stronger

demisexuality,f4k5ajk,t3_dkqmkt,1571635996.0,I didn’t even think I was a Demi I actually thought I was asexual for a while (though I didn’t use that word cuz of homophobic family and friends who don’t understand terms). I fell in love with this guy and after 11 months of dating and falling 100% head over heals I suddenly felt like it could be okay. We tried stuff and it was. Now I’m experimenting with all kinds of things and beginning to open up to who I’m allowed to be and trying to be myself despite my homophobic parents. (I should also mention I’m dating a not yet out trans woman)
mypartneristrans,f1g63ot,t3_d97mqe,1569460727.0,"Honestly I think that she’s using her new identity in a bad way. I don’t think dysphoria is a valid excuse for treating you the way she did in that moment, and I think that telling her how you feel about your own identity in relation to hers is the next step. I don’t think it’s fair for her to tell you to dress more feminine when you don’t want to. 
Also therapy is always important. Convincing her to get some when she’s having a hard time is important"
mypartneristrans,f0klj8x,t1_f0khha3,1568682025.0,If this doesn’t work maybe he can try to find a different job. Start some applications on there.
mypartneristrans,f0k5x4j,t1_f0k1nvl,1568671120.0,I still don’t quite understand what you mean here. Also just don’t push them too hard. Wait for them to open up to you.
mypartneristrans,f0k4yd2,t3_d52zvj,1568670427.0,"I’m only a high schooler and I can’t imagine two years of going through what you did as it has been a month since I’ve had to actualize this, but for one I know you’re not alone.

Your feelings are completely justified, and your actions understandable. That’s what I’ve learned through this reddit. You are very much mourning your husband as well as celebrating the “birth” of your wife so I believe having a ceremony is okay. Just make sure everyone involved is okay with it as well :)"
mypartneristrans,f09frd2,t1_f08wavy,1568500231.0,Oh no I know I just meant come to a “agreement” about where we stand with each other.
mypartneristrans,f08rr86,t1_f08kbf8,1568486586.0,Thank you so much. I’m feeling a lot better about being somewhat uncomfortable and knowing that it is justified. I think I will talk to her about this and see how we can come to a compromise of how we’re going to take this.
mypartneristrans,f08az0c,t1_f089f9o,1568478602.0,"Thanks for this. We have a group at our school that they have been going to, but I’ve never really felt like it’s my place to go. They have a group of people they can trust there and I don’t want to infringe on that. 

I 100% support this person as a friend but it’s a bit more complicated as SOs. I want them to be happy but ur right. I don’t think both our needs can meet up like this. I’ll start talking to them about what was advised here"
mypartneristrans,f06vvmj,t1_f06qetr,1568446915.0,Thanks that’s really helpful. Ive been so anxious about talking to the councilor about all this. I might try and do that now I just have a lot going on.
mypartneristrans,f06nx0a,t1_f069w30,1568441854.0,"We’re kind of at a standstill with talking about it because she knows I’m having a hard time accepting it.

But this became present when I had one day opened up about being attracted to females (freshman year I went through a spot of depression where I was dating a guy but kept seeing females that were attractive chalking it up to jealousy that I couldn’t look like them) but I wasn’t even sure about it as I told them. That’s probably the same day they told me about their dysmorphia. 

So we’ve talked but it’s been strained and really hard. Tomorrow’s homecoming and she hasn’t come out to anyone, and asked if it was okay to wear a dress. I stated honestly that if they did my parents would find out and it would be really bad. (they already hate my so) I also honestly stated that I was scared of the public knowing about this and wanted a chance to see them in dresses and skirts before it was public."
