\-Why did you graduate a 5-year uni course at 25? 

What i say: Well I had some financial issues I had to take care of myself. I was working and studying and it was too much to handle so i left uni a bit behind.

What i dont say: I suffer from chronic depression ever since i was a teenager. In my undergrad years it got so bad i almost killed myself numerous times. I got so anxious going back to uni at 24 for my senor year i was getting mild panic attacks.

\-Why dont you talk more around us? 

What i say: Well I dont like talking while having my lunch.

What i dont say: I spent 7 years in isolation and I have zero social skills and I have nothing to contribute in a conversation."
