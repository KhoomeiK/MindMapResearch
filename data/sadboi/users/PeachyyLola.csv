notlikeothergirls,fr36qkw,t3_gltry7,1589851064.0,I saw an animated one with this sound and all the comments were unironically filled with not like other girls.
AskReddit,fr0boi9,t3_gln8tu,1589790004.0,"My grandfather had it. I’m not sure how bad it was but he died 2 weeks after he got it, in April. He was in his late 70’s and his nursing home had been infected. We expected him to live longer but he was suffering so long with dementia I kind of feel relieved. Covid-19 really sucks, I’m really sad he died suffering more than he should’ve."
bipolar,fr0b64p,t3_glq0e7,1589789521.0,"Dude, I always want congratulations for the smallest of things. THIS IS HUGE! You’re not selfish at all! You made it! Be proud! You’re family is probably so proud, my oldest sister was the first to graduate college and I still cry because I’m so proud, she went through a lot too. College can be tough on anyone, but you really went through it and you pushed through. And I’m proud of you! Congratulations, you really deserve it."
TwoSentenceHorror,fqgfbsi,t1_fqg7w2u,1589344819.0,I could’ve gone my whole life without seeing that
mentalhealth,fpmxgqq,t3_ge1dz0,1588744282.0,"My sister was really suicidal when she watched that show, the warnings never helped and I had to talk her out of suicide. I think it’s an abomination to the mental health community and shouldn’t even be up. I hate that show to it’s core."
AmItheAsshole,fpczcgl,t3_gcoc8s,1588516434.0,"YTA. You have a problem with your sister but she didn’t ask for this, she’s just trying to get close to you and you’re being a brat. I’m the same age as you and even I have the capacity to see you’re being unfair to her. Your problem is with your parents don’t take it out on an innocent person and don’t lie to get your sister in trouble. That’s so wrong and you’re very immature."

notlikeothergirls,flmutlg,t3_fpc54y,1585297581.0,"She’s 5’5” and thinks it makes her manly... I’m 5’8” and literally it’s no different from being short, just the occasional “wow you’re kinda tall” comments. And I’m not even that tall. Girls really trying to be quirky for being AVERAGE height."
AmItheAsshole,fleljuw,t3_fo2nzc,1585086703.0,"YTA because she’s in a weird situation too, she is aware she’s not your mom. As a teenager myself I understand you want to do as you please without authority. You could’ve made her feel better by saying your going to bed and then just being really quiet while you do what you want and pretending to be asleep when she comes to check. It’s not that hard. I’m 15 myself and even I know that."

teenagers,fl04go6,t3_flqony,1584691140.0,"Okay to clarify I was just curious what people actually do when they’re no longer a teenager. Like do you stay on the subreddit, does it even count if you post without being a teenager?? I’m just very curious about this stuff and it’s 4am so why not ask the subreddit."

insaneparents,fko1dqk,t3_fjjmbl,1584378188.0,"My boyfriend has very narcissistic parents and he’s genuinely considering running away and I’m seriously worried about his mental health. His parents like me and it’s so hard to pretend that I like them when I know how horribly they treat him. It’s his birthday and they’re forcing him to do something he doesn’t want to do, and I’m coming along to make sure he has at least a little fun. I feel so horrible for the people going through so much more than that. I can’t believe parents can be so cruel to an innocent child. For all of you stuck at home suffering, I hope you find a way out eventually. Stay strong and stay safe!"
AmItheAsshole,fkimljn,t1_fkhy83o,1584223577.0,Yeah with that information you are 100% NTA! They don’t force their second child to see you as a sibling so you shouldn’t have to give them the title of grandparents when they skipped the work and are being hypocritical.
IDontWorkHereLady,fkikjyi,t1_fkijsjb,1584222191.0,"They don’t work there though, they don’t have to be nice."
creepyPMs,fkajl5j,t3_fh4zwi,1584010653.0,"It’s kind of crazy how he knows what this subreddit is and still has that kind of behavior, normally people on here realize you probably won’t get your pp sucked when you try to blackmail someone. Key word: try."
AmItheAsshole,fjhvbgd,t3_fde4qr,1583355721.0,Tell her you won’t and that you’ll cut her off from your life if she doesn’t stop trying to force you to pay for something you didn’t have much of a choice in. You 100% are NTA! Let her know this argument won’t hold up in court and that she can’t do a single thing to make you pay. It was her choice to pay so much for something you could end up dropping.
AskReddit,fawg45e,t3_ealj7k,1576370689.0,"My boyfriend has been mentioning me drawing him because I’ve been wanting to do it since we started dating but I haven’t found the right picture until now, I’m still working on it but my point is he’s definitely getting a drawing of himself this Christmas. (I’m an artist and I do pretty awesome with anime styles and he really wants to see what he’d look like as anime character lol)"

unpopularopinion,f6xne4i,t3_dtebay,1573253395.0,"I think it’s okay to read them and find them interesting, it’s a good way to pass time for me, but using it to excuse toxic behavior is wrong. I think that’s why people feel negatively towards it, they have people in their life using it to excuse toxic behaviors."
