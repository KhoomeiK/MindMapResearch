lonely,fdkecky,t3_elpetb,1578502072.0,"I disagree. I'm good looking but I've never really had any friends because I'm pretty quiet, awkward and don't talk very much. I always see less attractive people at school with friends and such having a good time. I also see lots of them with super pretty girlfriends. It mostly has to do with personality. If you talk a lot and have this bubbly personality, people will be attracted to that. But if you're like me, quiet and reserved, you're unapproachable no matter how good looking you are."

socialanxiety,f7xj0fu,t3_dxxi9o,1574059528.0,"The best thing to do is relax and take it one step at a time. Take deep breaths and ease your anxiety. Then ask your landlord if you can be a little late with your bills. If they say yes, then good. If not, then ask your parents. I'm Filipino too, so I know how the older generation of Filipinos are with mental illnesses. Regardless, you should still ask them or someone in your family to help. Afterwards, start looking for a job. Remember it doesn't have to be all at once. Take it one step at a time. If you need someone to talk to, message me."

So when you tell them about that, I'm sure they won't care too much. I'm 24 too, and I lost my virginity last year to my ex ldgf (long distance). She's the only person I've ever had sex with too. Prior to this, only had one real gf, which lasted only a few months, and only kissed 3 other girls. So my experience was pretty small and still is tbh. You said that you're attractive to the opposite sex, so it shouldn't be a problem. Just be patient."
