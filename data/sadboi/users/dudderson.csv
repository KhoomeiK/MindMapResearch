""No one wants to see that"" ""gross"" ""only pretty people should be seen"". I am aware its wrong but i have lived my whole life hating myself, thinking im ugly and being way to over critical, that it spills onto thinking the same of complete strangers. It was never as bad as it has been these past few years. It has many similarities to my paranoid delusions-I know its not normal or healthy and i know its not real, but i cant stop it from rearing its ugly head and thinking its reality."

I empathise with pretty much everything you are saying and then some, and i just found this sub after looking over all the symptoms of body dysmorphia after watching a video talking about the DSMV's description of agoraphobia and its link to body dysmorphia. I was like-omg. Omg. I have both, this is a thing, this is an actual thing and im feeling all of this. Then coming here, i see myself in almost every post. I have an apt with my psychiatrist next week (thank god over the phone due to covid19 so i dont have to leave the house)  and i want to try bringing it up. Also, i agree with the other poster who talked about how poor mental health care is and that most girls and women grow up with some form of this. But mental health is so stigmatised, people just want to jump on the ""they are faking it, toughen up, just ignore it"" bandwagon."
BodyDysmorphia,flqrzkd,t3_fo0suo,1585404698.0,"Omg everyday i think about how much i wish i could import myself into Sims and change my entire body. I make myself in the sims sometimes and make myself work out obsessively so i lose the weight, give myself fuller hair that isnt thinning up top, and never have to worry about stretch marks, loose skin or the inevitable saggy breasts. Then i give myself a chin and pit on cute clothes. And if i put on makeup, its not like putting lipstick on a pig like now where if i try putting on makeup i know people will just think im trying to hard."
BodyDysmorphia,flqrf4b,t3_fokrm0,1585404266.0,"I relate to this a lot. I was skinny my whole life up until like 10 years ago when multiple psych meds infamous for extreme weight gain, my binge eating, inactivity from chronic pain and only being able to afford crap food all piled on so much weight that over time i gained 100lbs. I dont remember having a problem with overweight people before, but now that im morbidly obese and disgusting, i think almost every fat person i see on instagram is gross too, because i see myself in them. I judge them like i judge myself. Its gotten so extreme that i think no one should be fat, everyone should be their healthy weight because since even i dont want to look at myself, no one should have to look at any fat person. I know its horribly toxic, but i cant even leave the house let alone go to therapy. My PTSD and dysmorphia make it so its incredibly difficult to leave my room. So i relate. But this guy youre interested in and who is interested in you clearly likes you. He's seen your weight and obviously it doesnt bother him if he is pursuing you. I know its a big hurdle to jump, and telling you to just accept that and try to be comfortable and forget about it isnt as easy as saying it, but i hope you start to believe that he is interested in you for who you are."
BodyDysmorphia,flqq8tg,t3_fp1lpy,1585403353.0,"So many times i have thought about this same thing. I wish at least i was still skinny but the psych meds im on and not being able to afford good food has packed on the weight and made me even grosser and hideous. For like a week or two i started an instagram and posted cleavage shots with the intent of gaining a following and doing onlyfans, but hardly anyone liked my stuff as usual and i hated it so i stopped and turned it into an art insta. I constantly look at tummy tuck, breast reduction and bbl surgery before and afters. Im trying to get my jaw fixed through a medical surgery that i need anyways but if i can get it, i can at least have a jaw. I hate my body and every 5 minutes im wishing i had the body of this person or that person."
BodyDysmorphia,flqplcu,t3_fovnup,1585402830.0,"This lockdown hasnt changed a thing for me. The only time i leave the house is to go to one of my many doctors or my psychiatrist. If i have to go to the grocery store, i only feel safe with my brother or sister right there next to me. On top of that, every time i go out i feel even more ashamed and disgusting and hideously fat and i dont want anyone to see me. I know im ruining their day. I know they are all looking at me and thinking about how disgusting i am. Im immensely grateful that my psychiatrist office has closed and shes taking all appointments by phone now. I hate myself, i hate mirrors, or any reflective surface. Going on the computer is even hard because sometimes i can see my reflection in the screen. But its better at home because my dogs protect me, and im not seen by anyone but my brother and roommate."
BodyDysmorphia,flqoyyn,t3_fpd95z,1585402319.0,"I feels the same but a little different.

And basically i think almost everyone is better looking than me and im just ruining their day by leaving the house. Im sure even my doctors and psychiatrist and medical specialists all hate when i come in because they have to look at me."

It sounds like you live elsewhere since you said you are living with parents due to college being cut short. Also are you home enough after quarantine to be there for an animal? If you were living in a dorm prior and busy most of the time, it's not like you could take the cat to the dorms so she would be the one taking care of the pet for the rest of the year(s) you are a student. Also how would you financially take care of the cat if you don't have a job? That would mean your parents being financially responsible for the adoption fees, food, litter, supplies and any health costs for however long. And you said she hates cats. So how would you expect her to be responsible for a cat?. I know firsthand that living with an nparent is immensely painful and damaging, but if you wanted a pet just to get you through these two months of being home without planning for being able to provide for and take care of said pet for 14 years or more, then maybe its not the best idea. Yes, wanting to help an animal in over crowded shelters is very noble, and I wish everyone had a heart like that. I worked in animal rescue and i wished all the time i could give every dog and cat i met a safe and loving home like they deserved. But from what you wrote, and maybe its just how you wrote it, it seems like you just need someone to get you through quarantine and are desperate to find a solution that might not be in an animal's best interest."
