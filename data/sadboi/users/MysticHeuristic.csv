schizoaffective,fmz8af6,t3_fxfzum,1586510339.0,All the time. The longest I've gone without having a hallucination is a week. But with meds I'm better at ignoring them and they arent as intrusive as they used to be
schizoaffective,fms7bas,t3_fx4whx,1586348714.0,I hope for a normal life. I'm tired of being tired. My hallucinations are just too much sometimes
schizoaffective,fkvom4b,t3_fkklfq,1584573485.0,Playing guitar and hanging with friends as well as a nice walk on a beautiful sunny day
schizoaffective,ff05wva,t3_eqyyf5,1579465545.0,"I often have dreams where I'm psychotic and vividly hallucinating. 2 years ago I was having constant, loud, and vivid hallucinations 24/7 because even in my sleep I was still having hallucinations."
schizoaffective,fel6aza,t1_fej9ldx,1579214983.0,Anyone can do it if they sit down and do it!
schizoaffective,fel68gk,t1_feh8gie,1579214940.0,Thank you!! I'm proud of myself
schizoaffective,fel67fw,t1_fegsp1g,1579214921.0,Well it must have been the teacher's name intimidating you the second time lol
schizoaffective,fel64at,t1_fegs7ob,1579214868.0,How far did you get to?
schizoaffective,fel62r3,t1_fegkz3m,1579214841.0,So far it's just vectors and multivariable calculus
schizoaffective,fel609p,t1_fegbxyk,1579214799.0,Thank you!
schizoaffective,fcjbey1,t3_eheix7,1577682096.0,I think a lot of us have been there. I know I have felt this way before. All I can say is that I've gotten better. My hallucinations dont bother me anymore and I've actually become happy. Just please dont give up. You can regain what you lost except you'll be even cooler because you've been through darkness and come out the other side.
schizoaffective,fbjj71e,t1_fbjg0r6,1576934552.0,Definitely call her! My mom passed away a year ago and I sure wish I could see her these holidays. Nights are bad for me too. I would try and spend time with friends soon. I'm sure you have some people you can go to and express your mood in an honest way. If you don't have friends then try and make some! People ate generally pretty friendly if you're an honest person.
schizoaffective,fbjew24,t3_edeoie,1576931999.0,"Sometimes a good conversation with a loved one where you vent your feelings is all it takes to change your mood positively. I would try and refrain from depressants like recreational drugs but I understand that sometimes it's all you have. Remember that gratitude goes a long way so count your blessings, be thankful, and live in the moment. Enjoy your life. You're only guaranteed one. Hope this helps, bless your soul these holidays."
schizoaffective,fbcb7sh,t3_ech075,1576719955.0,"My mom died of cancer last year. This year has been the hardest ever. Not wanting to scare you but if he passes you will have to stay strong because life will get very difficult really quick.. Keep your head up and use your support system. One day, one breath at a time. I believe in you. You're in my prayers. ."
schizoaffective,fach7iz,t1_fa9rm7k,1575939469.0,Yes. Started in early 2018
schizoaffective,fa8p71x,t3_e7yee0,1575851430.0,I've been on Invega 2 months and I've had what you're describing but I thought it was a symptom not a side effect because it went away
bipolar,f9tcmb9,t3_e6tawl,1575617451.0,It's like we are either driving 15 or 90 down the highway. Both are dangerous.
schizoaffective,f9tc1mq,t3_e6rdyz,1575616707.0,Pleeeeeaaaaaaseee don't fucking do it!! The pain you feel will get 1000X worse once you make that decision and you hang there dying full of regret. You can get better. Praying for you. Suicide is NEVER the answer.
schizoaffective,f9tbiu0,t3_e6tiit,1575616036.0,"I've been there before. I thought that everyone was basically a hallucination of sorts and that I was the only being in the universe. I felt very alone. I can tell you that you are not alone. I don't know you but my real name is Cole and I am 23. I have had a full crazy life with this illness. I have had delusions similar to what you're describing but I made it out okay. Reach out to people you trust and make them aware of just what is going on with you. When I finally reached out to my best friend, she responded with love and I began to stabilize almost instantly from my psychosis (I thought I was Jesus... again). I wish you peace and love while you battle this dark period. I believe in you, stranger."
schizoaffective,f9tb43q,t3_e6u3ys,1575615521.0,Better safe than sorry. At least get a professional evaluation.
schizoaffective,f9tb1mo,t3_e6thz6,1575615438.0,"Just take them. Even if you're right, which you're not, they will punish you for not following their plan so just go with it. If it really is a big conspiracy then you truly are powerless. Might as well take them then on the chance that they HELP you. Which I can assure you 100 percent that they will help you. I used to think my lithium was going to make me infertile. Just try and find a combination that works. Tell your Doctor that you really wanna get better and that you are willing to comply and they will find out what meds work with you. It's their JOB."
schizoaffective,f9t8p4e,t1_f9t5tgz,1575612731.0,I smoke homegrown and use a CBD vape to calm down
schizoaffective,f9si82e,t3_e6o0yj,1575592930.0,Weed gives me panic attacks as well as vivid paranoid hallucinations. However when I come down I feel great and I sleep really well. The great feeling lasts for about a week then I smoke again. I also learned to open up to friends about my hallucinations while on weed so now I'm less bothered by them because I have more evidence that it's just in my head now. Unsure if I should continue smoking because I'm in a great place now but I know that if I'm depressed it IS an option. Peace and love to you all in your mental health journey
schizoaffective,f9paj81,t3_e68sw6,1575527310.0,"Listen. Don't give up. I became stable when I articulated exactly what my hallucinations and delusions were to my friends and family. Try journaling if you aren't already. Write what you're experiencing. Getting it off your chest will relieve some inner pressure. Also you will be able to see patterns that you can use to predict an episode and mitigate the consequences. You WILL get better. It just takes time and a little effort on your part. Again, communicate what's happening PRECISELY to someone you trust like your therapist. Have someone work logically and emotionally through your delusions. A trick I learned is that I admit there is an ""enemy"" out there like the devil. When I realize I'm having a delusion I go ""oh is this your master plan? To trick me into thinking []? Well it's not gonna work because I know Jesus. Apparently he loves everybody. And he is the most powerful thing there is"" it really works for me. Let me know if I can help, I hope this does"
schizoaffective,f93pv4g,t3_e3kvl2,1575065360.0,"New member here, I feel more alive when I am hallucinating or psychotic because I feel like my homeostasis is shaken up and I feel simultaneously closer to the universe, like the things I'm hearing are guiding me to an absolute truth that there is more to life than meets the eye, while also feeling isolated from humanity because the rapid ups and downs when I'm hallucinating makes me feel like I'm abnormal and unable to Be with everyone else because I'm frankly terrified of death and then feel more alive that way. I'm currently writing this in a bedroom while my family is enjoying Thanksgiving festivities of football and monopoly. I think when I'm ""normal"" (as normal as I can be) I feel like I have this big thing to share, like if people would understand what I've been through then they would finally let me in the circle.i didnt even get invited to play... I don't know why your psychosis is primarily demons and extraterrestrials themed, mine is this reoccurring theme of me being some science experiment and people can read my mind and I have a chip in my brain making me hear peoples thoughts.i also have pretty dark ones of my dead mom but those are really too painful to talk about right now. Maybe yours are that way because you are afraid but also curious about beings above us in dimensional understanding..I dunno I could guess why yours are that way but I need more specifics about You because I think psychosis is a very personal experience. anyway I wish you the best"
