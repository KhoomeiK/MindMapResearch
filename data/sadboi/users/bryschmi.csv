sales,fmzrrvz,t3_fy6ldl,1586528178.0,"See a lot of great advice on here. I’d also personally recommend you try out CBD for these calls. 

I have anxiety and my presentations/meeting leads were infinitely better with CBD. My bosses even told me I was very improved from the first time (without CBD — they didn’t know I was on it, they just told me I was a lot more collected and comfortable). 

It won’t make you foggy minded either."

UpliftingNews,fm954hk,t1_fm8mq6z,1585861894.0,"Anxiety can cause chest pains and throat discomforts. If you mention paranoia, I’m assuming it’s just that. I have anxiety and never had physical symptoms until last week, when I couldn’t stop thinking of it"
benzodiazepines,fm87big,t3_ftoyil,1585844155.0,Get CBD from a gas station. And weed if you can but go heavy on the CBD.
CoronavirusUS,flull7l,t1_flul3pz,1585505066.0,"Oh I didn’t know that. Maybe this bidding war will incentivize companies enough to just make this medical/protective equipment (as we’re already seeing with dozens of huge corporations). Sounds initially fucked up, but I think it’ll help the economy and lead to a sufficient amount of supplies.

Who knows though, I’m both an optimist and a capitalist, so I may be a bit biased lol"
Catholicism,flu7d11,t1_flu75il,1585496812.0,Thanks! I’ll check it out right now
Catholicism,flu3vph,t1_flspqko,1585494633.0,"St. Patrick’s legendary Cathedral in NYC is life streaming mass right now! I’m sure a recorded version will be up on the internet for free within an hour or two. I have also been reading the Bible in a recommended logical order (not chronological); there are plenty of suggestions on what order to read it in for first timers (like myself, although I’ve been raised a catholic my whole life)"

Anxietyhelp,flr2go7,t1_flp1wl0,1585411579.0,"How would you describe the throat feeling? I have a weird feeling in mine the past 4 days, but I know it’s not COVID and just my anxiety because the sore throat comes in waves, and it doesn’t hurt at all to swallow (virus patients say it feels like tiny sharp knives in their throat when they swallow), plus my temperature is fine"
benzorecovery,flquv5u,t1_flpl9w5,1585406756.0,"I could barely smoke when I was first getting off it, I get the feeling. My advice, since weed is awesome lol, would be to baby step your way back into weed. Do this by buying CBD flower and mixing it in your blunts/bowls/etc. This will ensure you have a indica dominant, high CBD strain that won’t tweak you out too much. Then slowly scale down the proportion of CBD to THC ratio over a couple months"
benzorecovery,flqumt6,t1_flpmbvc,1585406595.0,"Yeah I was probably “only” averaging 2 mg a day towards the end, was still certainly risky though. And it keep working on it; only easier from here!"
benzorecovery,flph2ux,t1_flpglk0,1585359322.0,I think “beans” are just associated with Xanax but not 100% sure

Anxiety,fksiimx,t1_fkshlpc,1584490865.0,Even cut out smoking and going solely the edibles route for now — had dabs the other day and convinced myself I was the very first person in Indiana to get corona lol. Fuck having anxiety during this time.
Anxiety,fkshoyu,t1_fks4mu9,1584490332.0,"I had one the other night. I bet you’ll be fine, could easily be allergies this time of year. Just keep taking your temperature and if you feel bad at any point it can’t hurt to get tested, and don’t worry, you still have a 97% chance worse comes to worse, great odds!! You’ll be fine, I know it’s scary though"
Anxiety,fksheuz,t1_fks1nfn,1584490147.0,"Same here! I know I don’t have it, but when I have been having some edibles the past few days I get shortness of breath and focus way too much on my chest and trick myself into having minor chest pains just from the added anxiety weed gives sometimes. Good to hear a lot of others on hear are dealing with this"
Anxiety,fksgxdx,t1_fksb7gm,1584489831.0,"Same exact thing here. Took my temp, no cough at all, but I’m like even convincing myself i have minor chest pain. I usually smoke a lot of weed but have been too scared to lately bc my anxiety gets so bad I convince myself I have corona every time. Can’t even kill the boredom of these shutdowns :("

Psychedelics,fkjr707,t1_fkjqv7t,1584256006.0,"You’re very right. I’m calming down a bit now. But I think the internal struggles psychedelics give me only strengthen me. I’m fighting some internal demons right now, and honestly it’s hell but it’s therapeutic. I look at it as I’m struggling now, but it’s all worth it in the end (of the trip) lol"
Psychedelics,fkjpzta,t3_fix9ii,1584254577.0,I just don’t want to wake up and be right back into the swing of things of popping Xanax like it’s candy. I love being clean. Life has been awesome since I got off and the worst of the withdrawals stopped.
Psychedelics,fkjor09,t1_fkjoa1y,1584253169.0,"I was so addicted. The withdrawals were horrible. Don’t want to go down that slippery slope, but like my anxiety is so bad right now I’m having trouble breathing. But then I calm myself down. But then it comes back again – it’s like it’s waves of bad and good"
Psychedelics,fj8i5w0,t1_fj75a0c,1583113958.0,"Was thinking the same thoughts last weekend on shrooms. I’m convinced that’s truly the scary part of psychedelics — just thinking you’re permanently stuck in a “crazy” mindset. Only way I somewhat calmed myself down was telling myself it’ll all be over soon, but I didn’t even really believe that in the moment lol"

sportsbetting,fdpjo1h,t1_fdph2c0,1578630453.0,"Look up George Kent and Vegas Refund on Twitter. There are more, I’m sure, but these two I know are around 59-60%. Vegas refund in his “primetime” picks is around 70-75% for NCAA FB and NFL. They post their records and update periodically. And you can’t edit tweets and they have a big following so it’s legit"
sportsbetting,fdmit1z,t3_em2jao,1578551437.0,"Vegas always knows... with that being said, unless these bots have a competitive advantage over the average sports bettor, wouldn’t more hours of betting = more losses??? Are they AI bots that improve over time and become as good as some pro sports bettors out there (around 60-65% winning %, to my knowledge)?

EDIT: I guess I technically mean “machine learning” and not “AI”, but you get the point"
