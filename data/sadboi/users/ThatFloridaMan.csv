cigars,eub3hzu,t3_cfncno,1563638798.0,"I'm still new to cigars, and after enjoying a few dozen or so, I decided it was time to really stock up and fill my humidor. I made an order from Fox with mostly budget friendly sticks, and a handful of samplers, so that I could continue to explore and find what I like. I included in my order note that I didn't receive any stickers on my last order, so they gave me an excessive amount this time around! Everything along the top row (next to the note) was freebies. Because I'm a nerd, I did the math on how much of a 'discount' I got with the freebies. It should be noted that last order my 'discount' equaled about 8.6%. This time around, my 'discount' was about 16.6% **not including** the unbranded stick, the cutter, or the bottle opener (which is awesome, and I will be using all the time). Overall, the 'discount' you get with Fox is on par or better than what you can get with other online cigar merchants, plus they have good prices, free shipping, and (from what I hear) great customer service. I am extremely pleased with the turnout, and I will definitely be using Fox again. Thanks Fox, and Lake (new guy)! :)"

One day there was this guy at the marina, who was talking to my sister and me, and innocent 10 year old me didn't see a problem with it. My Mom noticed, and came over from the boat (probably about 50 feet away) and asked the guy to leave us alone. I remember being kind of upset that she was being mean to him because he was nice.

A bit later, he was talking to us again, and (if I'm remembering correctly) went in his hotel room at the marina, and asked us if we'd like to come in. My mom saw this, and she *went off*. I've never seen my mom so angry in my life, and don't think I have since. She's always been upfront about how she feels, but was never the yelling type. She tore this guy a new asshole.
