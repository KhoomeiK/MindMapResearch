BPD,fp1lk0z,t3_gaqpvd,1588239719.0,"I resonate with that so much! Unfortunately, I haven’t found an easy fix. It is a day to day struggle, and every day is different. Distracting yourself (especially during times when you know your FP isn’t busy or they’re on social media) is very helpful. I work with my FP and on the days we work together I feel like a child in boarding school who has to act prim and proper, because the minute she changes her attitude towards me I become consumed with my black and white thinking and assume I’ve ruined the relationship. I also have to assume that we aren’t friends until she says otherwise, or else I’m going to keep setting myself up to be hurt."
BPD,fp1dk8d,t1_fp0cg7l,1588231965.0,"Man I feel this too. I have to take it literally day by day, and I have to treat her cordial and assuming we aren’t friends until she says otherwise. I’m almost ashamed of how quickly I will run back to them. It almost feels as if they are gas lighting me, knowing how my anxiety and abandonment issues are."
BPD,fp1d4w7,t3_gajrkb,1588231564.0,"I am struggling hard with my FP right now. And I sent my FP a message (weeks ago) explaining what that means and what they mean to me, and she has not responded to that message, but treats me completely normal when she sees me at work. Not texting her and not reaching out is a daily struggle that has its ups and downs. Some days are easier than others. I’m realizing that even if I text her, assuming I get a response, it’s never going to be the response I want (and I don’t even know what that is). Distraction is one of the best things you can do, especially during a time when you know your FP is online or just lounging at home. If you need to vent, talk or support please message me!"
BPD,fp1c8fj,t3_gadzsv,1588230753.0,Holy shit this post speaks to me. This lists so many symptoms that I feel like I’ve been trying to describe but haven’t figured out how. Not learning from our past choices and continuing to use negative coping skills time and time again is something I’m really struggling with.
BPD,fmui1iw,t3_fwy9gb,1586391813.0,"I can relate to this. I tell myself that I am not good enough to be in their life anymore, so I start to distance myself because the hurt of them leaving is waaayy worse. And you’re right, everyone becomes more distant once you start distancing yourself, which is a shitty feeling. Because you would think your real peer supports would see that as a sign and check in, or stop it."
BPD,fmp62ab,t3_fw5x9x,1586275109.0,I am totally down to chat and gain more peer supports!! This offer is for any and every one!
BPD,fmg34ze,t3_fuh1xv,1586040264.0,"I can empathize with you on this. My FP is a co-worker, and I sent her a long message explaining that she’s my FP (with an article) and ways I’m going to improve on my emotional dependency and other things. It was a pretty vulnerable message honestly. She literally hasn’t responded to it, and didn’t/doesn’t mention it when I see her. I had to ask her if she got it, and she said yes, and said she was working on a response but hasn’t had the chance with “everything going on.” It just feels like she is refusing to make time for me about this important topic, which often eats me alive sometimes, sends me into a spiral of emotion and crying about the possible abandonment (and goddamnit am I’m struggling with that hardcore). And I’m not going to continue to bring it up because things have actually been good between us lately, so I don’t want to ruin that."
BPD,flqfhgc,t3_fqev2m,1585392578.0,"I feel this too. As introverted as I am, I miss having that human connection. I’m going through FP troubles and can understand not being able to see your boyfriend.
I want to encourage you to try and seek therapy somehow, someway. I know there are places doing video and phone appointments. I’m not trying to give advice, I just want to help. Or maybe I’m just really clingy to therapy right now and talk about it until I’m crazy eyed 😬 For me, I’m realizing that increasing support is the only thing I can hang on to during this crazy time."
BPD,flesahp,t1_fleq9e2,1585090523.0,Thank you soooo much for that article!! It literally describes me and my situation to a fucking T. I can’t believe other people go through this like I do.
BPD,flejfy0,t1_fldks3g,1585085553.0,"I’ve noticed too that my mood can change drastically based on our interactions. And if I feel like she is upset with me I freak out and constantly check in and ask if we’re okay. And if she starts treating me different I get really upset and stand-off ish because I’m afraid I’m going to lose her, so then I do things to push her away?! I am so confused with myself. I feel so weird and creepy."
BPD,fkgrqqu,t3_fi8fuf,1584171147.0,"I’ve done both in patient and out patient programs and I have a designated outside therapist. From my experiences I’ve learned that if you don’t feel connected and trusting of your therapist, you won’t feel comfortable enough to open up. It takes a shit ton of courage and strength (even if it doesn’t feel courageous at the time) to dive into your trauma box and unravel the tangles inside. Especially since a lot of us have attachment/abandonment issues, it is important to feel safe and supported by your therapist. 
In these experiences these therapists have learned what to say to trigger me into opening up, and how to bring me out of the spiral and ground myself again. One thing I found helpful is writing down what you want to talk about or work on and bring it in and start off a session that way. I hope any of this word vomit helps!

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I also feel the same way sometimes! Especially with my old therapist, I often would sit there thinking of what to say, and I believe it’s because we didn’t have a great connection. She didn’t really know what to talk about or where to go, and she wasn’t great at comforting when I was a tearful mess. 
She quit her job without notifying/warning me (knowing I have abandonment issues) even though we talked two days prior while I was heading into a crisis. 👎🏼 
Therapists and counselors really don’t get upset when you ask to find someone else, they understand it’s all about the connection!"
BPD,fjz2huc,t3_ffd320,1583709874.0,I’ve learned that catastrophizing situations like that is something we do to protect ourselves. I constantly go through several random confrontations in my head to see how they would play out and what would happen so I could be prepared. In real time confrontations I just apologize or get rage-y (mostly to my mother who is a big reason I’m fucked up) or I just shut down and cry 😬
BPD,fjx0m88,t3_ff1l3e,1583651483.0,"For me completely restricting it makes the urges and cravings that much stronger, and the binge quicker and larger. I understand what you mean between knowing you should quit but not wanting too. I’m trying to set some limits like only smoking after 6pm and maybe trying some more CBD heavy weed to see if that helps the emotions. I like what the above commenter said too, I’ll try that!"
BPD,fjtjdck,t3_fesijx,1583608362.0,"I have never related to a post so much. What’s fucking with me the most is when I’m feeling like I’m getting better or having a good day, and somehow something happens and either I self sabotage or internally self loathe and have self hatred and get depressed. I constantly think “what’s the point? I’m not strong enough to do this and it won’t work anyway.” And we deserve to be happy, to feel good about ourselves, and to not hurt. Someone somewhere at some time went through the same feelings and emotions we are going through, and they were able to get through it. Growth is a dance. Something that has helped me is to feel those feelings and work through them, suppressing them makes them worse, and you might even learn something about your thought processes and coping skills in the process. I think having supports (peer and groups) and consistent therapy is what’s going to help us in the end. We can do this! 💪🏼"

BPDmemes,fizl06h,t1_fizch6c,1582865759.0,"I’m being honest and legitimate with this question, but do you think we can somehow manage to smoke weed and stay sane and safe? Do I really have to give it up completely?"
BPDmemes,fizkuke,t3_famazj,1582865628.0,WOW I feel so personally attacked right now 😬😬
BPD,fiweqa4,t3_f9zg5z,1582783234.0,"I always feel like people say positive things like that because they have to or they feel like they should. They don’t really mean what they’re saying, they’re doing it to try and comfort me so we can move on."
BPD,firv864,t3_f9enr6,1582671841.0,How do you stop yourself from letting yourself wallow? I know it’s not good for me but that’s what it feels like I need. Either that or I’m at the beginning of a crisis again.
BPD,fimajrb,t1_fill8p6,1582523113.0,I am starting to notice that this is something I’m doing as a means to protect myself related to my fear of abandonment. It’s almost easier if I just leave before they have a chance to hurt me.
BPD,filw86v,t3_f89uvh,1582511838.0,I feel this so much. I feel obsessive and clingy when I check in with people and asking if we’re “okay” or making sure they aren’t mad at me. I’m sure it’s exhausting for them and I feel like I’m pushing people away because of it. I hate knowing that others feel the same way I do. I thought I was alone in this completely.
