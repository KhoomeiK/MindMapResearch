BPD,ewlw98c,t1_ewl9h8q,1565537487.0,When we were first learning about it I had so many questions so honestly I may have said something offensive but openly communicating when you‚Äôre triggered is the best thing to do so your partner knows how it makes you feel.

BPD,ewjh0xv,t1_ewjb09u,1565466535.0,"Long response, but I wanted to give examples 
The more we talk about it the bad episodes are less frequent maybe one time in a couple months at this point (she spent years constantly disassociating and that was when things were often bad also that was before we ever even heard of bpd) 
You & your partner have to be willing to put in the time & communication. 
We‚Äôve spent many days/nights falling asleep in our living room, hallway and dining room floors yelling, crying, hugging or even in silence. Sometimes I have to walk away which I know fuels her feeling of abandonment but I‚Äôll tell her I need to walk away I will be back if I need a lot of time I will text her and reassure I just need a bit more time before I come back, I know I may sound selfish but I have to take care of myself in order to take care of someone else too and she‚Äôs learned to understand that as well (which took time & is still hard at times) 
There‚Äôs also times like last night she got super down but we talked through it and realized she was feeling a lot of financial guilt for mistakes made in the past. So we literally wrote out all our debt and talked about our plan of action to tackle it then went on a walk.
Once we got back home she was feeling better and even cooked us dinner. 
The reason I stay is unconditional love, I know that‚Äôs cheesy but when you find your person you‚Äôre willing to do everything you can for them and your relationship to survive. Also when they‚Äôre willing to try even when it‚Äôs super freakin hard for them it makes you want to push them to be their best self and cheer them on over every obstacle they overcome."
BPD,ewj8cmh,t1_ewj7i06,1565462821.0,That doesn‚Äôt make you either of those. Honestly sometimes hitting something helps üòÖ maybe next time though try a pillow lol
BPD,ewj606d,t3_colitw,1565461827.0,People SUCK. They see BPD and just start with their assumptions and stereotyping and don‚Äôt try to understand it. I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you.
