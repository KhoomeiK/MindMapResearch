Radiology,fr042zy,t3_glko0w,1589783137.0,"Looks like you already got most of the advice you need, but I didn't see anyone say this yet: 

I just graduated with my AS & BS on the same day. My program had it worked out so if you take a couple extra classes (16-18 credits/semester) you can do both at the same time. Not sure I would have been able to do it if I had to take an extra year. If you have the opportunity for this type of degree plan I can't see it hurting you in the long run."

Radiation from the sun is ionizing and can damage your cells. Yes, it is filtered by Earth's atmosphere. Yes, it still can cause damage.

5G is nonionizing radiation. It does not damage cells, interact with DNA, or any of that conspiracy crap."

You are free to refuse any exam you don't want. If you don't want an exam, that's between you and your doctor to decide what your options are at that point."

mentalhealth,erwu3vf,t1_erwto8d,1561356381.0,"I get that, I'm just tryin to say a walk-in mental health clinic would be treated differently from how urgent care clinics work & that's probably why they aren't really a thing. At least in the US I don't think we have a model for how that would work. Most urgent care providers are usually GPs, NPs, PAs, etc which is part of their convenience.  I would expect a mental health specific clinic would probably want providers with specific experience/training which would make them more challenging to staff"
mentalhealth,erwsmcn,t3_c4i02g,1561354643.0,"""Mental health emergencies"" is the key here. Urgent care clinics are for non emergent illness/injury. Most emergency rooms (that I have seen) are equipped with a mental health/monitoring room though. It makes more sense, like any chronic illness, to regularly see a specialist as opposed to rolling into a clinic that doesn't know your history. 
I'm not saying there should not be access to mental health specific emergency services, just that the needs of patients in those cases is probably different from someone with strep throat getting a script for antibiotics and being sent home."
