NarcissisticAbuse,fqaonsa,t3_ghqwb2,1589222630.0,"Yes I’ve done this. I used to cut myself as a kid but never slapped or hit myself until I was with my narc. I started feeling such rage towards myself after arguments that I would hit myself.

I think it’s because I was unable to be angry at him. So my brain turned my anger inwards against myself instead: that’s always been my coping mechanism, not sure why. But I always end up angry at myself because it’s “safe” to be angry at me, but it’s not safe to be angry at him because I’m emotionally dependent on him. 

I eventually stopped hitting myself because I was worried about damaging my head (I can hit myself pretty hard) and destroying my last brain cells.

The scariest part tho was after a rly bad argument I kept thinking about this huge knife in the kitchen and fantasizing about using it on myself and then he’d be sorry etc etc (he would probably have been relieved to be rid of me!)

The more you do it, the more it becomes a knee jerk reaction. I would suggest stopping it as soo  as possible."

If I try to bring up the stretch marks, loose skin that most women experience after pregnancy (and I already have stretch marks on my thighs!) he shows me edited pics of “hot mom bods” on Instagram. 

I think that if I have his kids and end up with stretch marks or saggy skin, he will blame me and say I did something wrong. And I will be stuck with a man who refuses to touch me."

Maybe she hasn’t left her boyfriend because she’s not sure if you’d even want to give it another try. I wouldn’t just ignore her though, that would be very painful for her.

I guess it would be your choice to decide whether you’re willing to stay in a relationship where the resentment is building and you have to bite your lip to make sure your needs don’t eclipse his own, or whether you’re willing to risk a breakup. 

(But even if you do break up, odds are 99% he will come back. They always do.) 

Btw, he may have depression but I have depression too. It’s not an excuse for treating your partner like you don’t care about them."
