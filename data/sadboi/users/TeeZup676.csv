SuicideWatch,filtl7w,t3_f7yaoi,1582510021.0,"depression and suicidal ideation are not diseases. the addiction and bad habits we fall into to cope just  as well should be diseases because they are just as infectious and debilitating. 

you may not see it but FOCUSING ON YOURSELF is the way you are showing your love to those in your life. how will you be able to love people if you yourself are broken and suicidal. I understand that for family and love you may make the exception to do crazy things, but you continuing to put forth an effort to get better in this life is also crazy, and I pray that it will give you peace while here on earth."

Thank you for sharing. Your story helped me know that I am not alone in my life experiences. Our stories are very similar with what you've shared. The only things holding me to this life is that I don't want to die with the music that I want to make in me. I also have a family that loves me. I can NOT frickin imagine your mind state as a music lover and maker with Tinninitus. I hope you can find some solution to make and enjoy music. I partially can relate because I am an attractive male that turns away female mates because of an embarrasing condition that ruined my sex life. As a horny and attractive male this makes me want to fuckin die. 

at the very least...

 DO NOT DIE WITH THE MUSIC STILL WITHIN YOU. do whatever you can to produce and release the music you have. then maybe think about death. probably a stupid thing to say but it's better than the default solution our brains are thinking of."

this experience is a part of introversion so maybe check out an introvert sub."
