You seem like exactly the person I have been looking for. 

Someone that would be willing to rp as many characters is wonderful! I have nothing against people who rp only 1, but I love character heavy rps and I focus on emotional arcs with the majority of mine.

I've been a worldbuilder for about 10 years now, and I've been developing a world in the last three that is still in the works, but it's almost done.

While not inherently medieval, it has aspects of it. The only real way to describe it at the moment is it's inspirations: a combination between Dungeons & Dragons, Adventure Time, and Fallout 4? 

Haha! 

If you're interested, I would love to rp with you.  Just lemme know what you think. If you have any other questions, I'll respond back to them about it!"

eden,fqxfgeg,t3_gldf0f,1589731458.0,"This is exactly what makes me angry. I get that people love the songs, but No Future felt like he was in a better mindset. Vertigo is sometimes painful to listen to, and revisiting those things are basically like saying to the artist: 'Oh, we don't care about your recent stuff. Appeal to our nostalgia and play your old shit that will remind you of how awful you felt when you wrote it!'

I wrote this angrily, so I may have contorted what to was trying to say, but I think it's ridiculous that people want him to play a song around something that he doesn't really want to revisit."
eden,fqb2uvw,t3_ggb8th,1589229616.0,"I don't listen to lyrics much. I don't look into them as much either. After all the songs that I've heard, I can really attach myself to only a few out of the thousands I've listened to.

What I've noticed is that when there's less of a  memorable chorus, or emotional tug, people don't cling to it. I think that's where people found their appeal in Jon's music.

To me on the other hand, it was the instrumentals of the songs. I've always loved the ones in Vertigo. The ones in No Future are splendid! 

Here's where they differentiate:

No Future had more ambient textures/ aspects about it. I've known for a while that people really don't...pay attention to that stuff. Maybe I do, but the vast majority of them probably don't. The ones in Vertigo felt more moody, and followed faster moving grooves/jives, while a lot of the songs in No Future are more mellow, and happy.

Like I said, I don't know how they differ lyrically. I've seen comments in this post saying Vertigo is very much like walking through a story and what not. And some say that No Future is a collection of songs with no cohesive story to them.

That's at least my take on this. I haven't listened to either album in a while, but that's all I know."

Volant's style has changed quite a bit since we last saw them. 

Other artists that would be wonderful include:

-Karma Fields(though I know they release independently now[and I've been keeping up with them], it would be nice to see them stop in).

-Soulji(I also know that they release independently, but man I really enjoyed their remixes)

-Varien(oh my God do I miss his music. I mean, I follow his stuff on his channel but it would be nice to see him return sometime.)

-ROYAL(remember her? The singer from City Lights? Her voice is beautiful. I actually listen to another one of her singles, Vessel, that was released independently and it's awesome. It would be cool to see her featured on another track).

Monstercat,fmtacsx,t1_fmt8phd,1586369419.0,"I somewhat agree. The sound in his music changed for a more chill/ popish sound. And I understand the disappointment when you say that the rappers/singers just don't compliment his music anymore or that his music doesn't have the same energy.

It is understandable, though, to have a sound change, and especially with how long he'd been away, maybe he was doing just that? I'm not sure. I've not really been as invested in his music as I used to, but I will agree with you that it is a bit more basic. 

That being said, it's not inherently bad. It's just bland, and with how Instinct looked, there will be some 'bland' artists thrown in the mix. For instance, I kinda forgot that Dexter King existed after his first few releases flopped. I don't want to spend my time listening to something generic I could hear from a radio station around where I lived. Monstercat has been up there with some other labels in their innovative music, and it's sad to see some artists take a more basic sound. In all honesty, usually it's to get more money or followers as let's be honest, not everyone is going to like a Infected Mushroom song for instance. Some people just don't like experimental things. I'm not saying LVTHER's sound became less experimental but more recognizable as a pop/low energy sort of sound. Maybe in the future he can make a return to his more danceable songs? Who knows.

To be honest, I have to agree with you. A lot of experimental artists and maybe even others probably stray away from the label because of their sound being too different. I will comment  that somehow, Mr. Bill and Infected Mushroom did have better luck, but that's most likely because they were already bigger names than Karma.

What I was thinking, however, was maybe somewhere along the lines of[Hypothetically] if Lorn or perhaps Shurk were to release a song. They have fanbases(Lorn certainly does), and it would be cool to shake things up a bit. I'm not sure, however, if their music would really be appreciated by the EDM community. Monstercat has always been pretty heavy on Dubstep, Future Bass, and the like, but something abstract here and there certainly helps breaking things up.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!"

As always, your artwork is spectacular!! I'm still in awe at how consistent the quality of them is. You've really got talent!

With this, here's some things I've found that i wanted to further investigate:

1. *Centinuus. Who exactly was he? And also, how did that become your username?*- So I used some context clues and came to the conclusion that he is the king of the Unitine Empire. Judging by the word itself, one could infer something about it being related to Center(am I looking a bit too deep into this? I sometimes over analyze things 🤣). I did a search of the word to see if it actually was one, but I found more lore posts from you which I may check out later! ( lol!) Also, how did he become the username you wished to go under?

2. *Lunari Tablets*- So I'm guessing the spirits that guided the Zigrati King to find these and then the Zigrati people found them. Lunan made them, but how did they create them? (I've always been fascinated with the actual creation of powerful items, so I'm just curious about this one!)

It's not much, but this is what I was curious about immediately. Thanks for posting once again, my dude! Its a joy to read more about these small things here and there. Thanks again!"

I actually love Nebulayo as well, which is a shock because I didn't like Everlasting Motion. Dun Dun Ba Ba is completely funny and I chuckle everytime I listen to it. It's a goofy tune. Here Comes The Sun is a wonderful rendition, but the one part that works me is that off-kilter jive towards the middle. Other than that, still a solid piece! People tend to forget about Bakumbe, A Noite, Make Me Cry, and Time To Rest Your Weary Head, but they are really beautiful as well. I love the folk inspirations in this album. The intro and outro are spectacular and beautiful. I think I let out an audible gasp when I heard Kathryn tickell's bagpipe playing. It was just awe-inspiring. Of course, talking about all this would undermine the stupendous Moon River rendition, which is just astounding on so many levels. Production, mixing, and sheer size of the sound is what really pulled me in. Plus of course, the insane microtonal harmonies that Jacob pulls off, as well as the plethora of voices at the beginning. The only real 'miss',(if you can call it that), was the more minimalistic It Don't Matter. I like the song, and I'll listen to it and enjoy it, but it's just not as memorable as some of the others. Still a cool song tho.

Overall, I'd give this album a 9/10. He seriously brought the best out of everyone's voices and the atmosphere and magnitude of this album is just gorgeous. I really hope that with Vol.3 that he can pull this off, but with the more funkier, electronic groove that he had going on in In My Bones. And if there's another groove like Time Alone With You, I think I'll be even more excited for what he has in store."

To me, she seemed like a spoiled brat, but her upbringing did NOT help her situation. The Diamonds, as we've seen, have done many bad things.

In a way, Greg and Pink were...alike. They both rebelled against their incredibly strict and degrading enviornments. Greg felt pushed to be someone he didn't feel that he was. Pink wanted to be a proper diamond, and when she got her colony, she felt pushed into going through with it. Both rebelled...and it left consequences. Greg's parents and him cut ties. They tried to reconnect, but it didn't work out. Pink started an all out war and went after her dream of protecting the earth. 

HOWEVER.

They both seemed to have some plan for their future, their ideal future..that is. Pink wanted to be on Earth and around humans. She witnessed the beauty of the planet and did fight for what was right to fix the mistake she made. While she did have her problems before(temper tantrums, a sour attitude, and other things), she grew up to understand that those actions were bad(at least I believe she did). Greg grew up and started his own gigs, and followed his passions. Instead of being crammed into a future he didn't want, he became who he wanted to be. They both wanted the best for Steven, and even though there were repercussions on both sides, they tried their best for him.

Skip ahead to Steven. I'm so deeply concerned with what's going on with him.  I am concerned especially for the training he had with Jasper. The shattering kind of brought to light to him what he was doing. He is spiraling out of control, and instead of trying to reconcile with his issues, he is reacting angrily to them and to people who care about him.

I will state that I understand that he must have some form of trauma/PTSD. This would definitely affect his mental state, and probably his thought process. What has me concerned is how he *decided* in his powerful state to go through with that attack. The 'rematch' was supposed to be just a simple fight. However, he BLOCKED Jasper in from escaping...and then proceeded to shatter her. I'm concerned that the fighting and aggressiveness he displayed was simply brought out by Jasper, and now that he's not afraid of his power that it will drive him crazy. 

Unlike Greg and Pink, Steven wasn't given structure and a normal life. He, being young, wanted to be a crystal gem...much like Pink wanted to be a Diamond. You know why? Because when you are young, you look up to the people around you. You don't look at the bad things that may accompany it. You see the hard work that someone else has put into their identity, and you want to be something like that. He didn't understand, and yet he still wanted to be a crystal gem. The crystal gems, unfortunately, are not good parents and Greg's style of parenting was not good at all on the poor kid. Because he didn't have some form of life outside of the crystal gem work, becoming a human and leaving Beach City will be incredibly hard for him. I could see him becoming the villain. At this point, isn't he already? 

The major point I wanted to make with this is that yes, he is basically becoming the opposite of Pink. He is becoming the villain and it's really awful to watch. He went from being this lovable and fun character to such a shadow of a person we once knew him to be. It's heartbreaking, really. He needs to open up and find consolation with his feelings. He needs someone to understand him, and to talk him through his problems. He may be able to help people out, but like my own mom said to me: ""Even the helper needs help""


Apologies for the long comment. If there's anything that you feel is out of place or wrong, please let me know. I typed this when I was like..half awake. Lol."

HomeDepot,fl5egbz,t3_fm1h2q,1584834809.0,"It's funny. Originally, I was supposed to be an OFA. Because my availability isn't the best, they balance me between both OFA and Lot each day. When it's an OFA day, everything is mostly chill. When it's Lot, it's usually just me rushing around trying to get all the carts in while swarms of people pour into the store. They won't change the schedules to overlap work time, and they don't schedule a second person! Ahhh!"
