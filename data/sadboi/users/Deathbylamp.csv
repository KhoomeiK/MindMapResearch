Also, anxious attachment.... wanting people to like us and fear of abandonment.  I have had a problem for years to not saying no and being agreeable.  I often overworked myself because my boundaries were too loose and took on other people's problems as my own.  Some of it is also that I'm generally empathetic person... at least that's why I try to help.  However, I use to do things I didn't want to because of self imposed guilt.  Some of that is rooted as a mechanism my family used to control me.  However, having strong boundaries comes with better self esteem and it's good to speak your mind and say no."

A lot of people get cheated on.  It's your fear of telling people which is a bit absurd.  Maybe reflect why you think it humiliating because clearly that says something about your own sense  of self worth.

No you should never have to jump out of a window to avoid someone unless your in actual danger.  That comes across as dramatic and childish.  Grow some balls and confront your family and your ex and tell them all what a horrible piece of shit she is for cheating on you.  You know what's more humiliating jumping out of a window because your too afraid of confrontation.  That's pretty humilating and embarrassing in my opinion.  It does speak highly of your own sense of self worth.  If you can't deal with these sort life situation how are you going to survive more difficult challenges in your life.

I hate to break it to you but people fucking cheat and relationships end.  If your family is a decent family then they should support you ending it because she was unfaithful.  Also,tell your family to stop meddling in your life.  

In general, stop being a coward."

It's the other men's fault for sexualizing her.  No matter what women wear we get sexualized.  It sucks that men can walk around topless and it's no big deal, but boobs... boobs are a fucking big deal.  Fuck that.  


You should be able to trust your wife to know that she isn't going to do anything.  Two, you should also know that no matter what she wears or where she goes there's going to be some dude out there thinking or saying inappropriate things.  It's not her body's fault for this.  It's the guys' fault for thinking it.  


I think you should go to hot yoga sometime with her.  Not say anything about her going topless, and continue to not say anything after.  Then think to yourself who is sexualizing who in that class, and whose fault it is for it.  Why do you feel so insecure about the fact other men are looking at her?  Why do you feel the need to be possessive enough to tell her what she can and can't wear while exercising?

ptsd,ewvnp7n,t3_cqb6o4,1565810145.0,"The enteric nervous system is effective by ""Flight or Fight"" responses and high-stress stimuli.  It is why when you are nervous you feel butterflies in your stomach.  Also, people who are not good at handling stress are more likely to have IBS.  Originally this part of your nervous system was created as sort of an energy storage.  Stress causes your stomach/digestion to slow down thus giving you more energy to deal with an emergency.  Unfortunately, we don't stress about physical danger as much anymore, and our brain does not know how to tell the difference between a physical endangering situation or one where we think we are... especially in incidents of trauma. PTSD can trigger flight/fight responses and cause digestion pain.  


Also, have you ever noticed how indigestion also makes you feel anxious?  Unfortunately, our brain sometimes can not always tell the difference.  Our mind understands reality by signals sent to our brain and when our stomach is upset sometimes our brain misunderstands that cause as stress instead of illness.  Perhaps this was once useful if we ate something and didn't know what it was and needed to alert others of sickness.  


Regardless, it serves less purpose now other than bad digestion and stomach pains."
