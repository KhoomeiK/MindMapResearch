factorio,fp9xes8,t1_fp9a6ou,1588436545.0,"to somewhat better explain what i think of it:  
factorio is a challenge. but not stress inducing. or rather put, i don't like the stressful aspect of Factorio at all. I enjoy the laid back nature of having biters off where i can create a factory as best as i can without the added concern and distractions of dealing with monster. The challenge and fun in factorio is discovering and designing and building, to me. i rarely use blueprints from previous games and prefer making new ones from scratch each time. This is what i find engaging in the game. Biters detract from that experience.

&#x200B;

Have you ever played games where they have a really great idea that they build a game around and then fill in the rest with less interesting shit to keep you occupied - and away from the more interesting aspects! if i'm allowed to exaggerate greatly that's how i feel about biters"

increased healing is nice but you usually put it on a character with pretty low dodge.
prot is nice too. but again, characters with this usually won’t have much dodge.

otherwise, it is very seldom a single individual’s fault a relationship collapses. maybe you messed up somewhere. she probably did too. this does not mean you don’t deserve love or affection. it does not mean you won’t find good people and close friends. don’t give into the self-pity.

i would rather see my pos4 mirana with a forcestaff or glimmer than a maelstrom. that way she can contribute more than damage which is already accounted for."
wholesomeyuri,f0mh44z,t3_d5jd2v,1568744837.0,such an amazing series. 3 episodes left to watch of the anime and i keep putting it off. keeping then for a bad day when i just need to feel a little fuzzy and warm.
Anxiety,f0mgxxw,t1_f0k45mc,1568744725.0,"not sure how available it is outside of south africa but i drink a lot of Rooibos. it’s a different plant from other teas and has no caffeine at all. also it apparently helps you sleep. but i’m always a lil’ skeptical of those claims. 
i had to cut out coffee earlier this year. then cut out green tea as well. it hasn’t been easy but rooibos and other herbal teas have helped a lot."
darkestdungeon,f0lqy6f,t1_f0lipl1,1568727244.0,"personally i think it was done really well. only had a single crash. the saving and updating seems to work well too. i honestly expected to run into more problems than i had.

i do miss the mod support when playing on ios though."
Stormlight_Archive,f05u24k,t1_f05r1pk,1568419694.0,Navani also points out that Dalinar is partially to blame too. the way he treats Elhokar  and his insistence if security such as when they went hunting the chasmfiend.
anime_irl,ez9in20,t1_ez97hmo,1567783157.0,"the anime is great. i’ve gotten quite a number of people to watch it who all, except one individual, seemed to thoroughly enjoy it.

the manga never got its hooks in me quite the same way"
anime_irl,ez9ic6x,t1_ez8qnye,1567782952.0,"i agree with Bloom Into You but i wouldn’t recommend Sakura Trick in the same way. i personally found Sakura Trick trying to be too sweet and the episodes feeling inconsequential. which is fine for a comedy if the humour is funny.

if it’s just drama you want to list, perhaps Strawberry Panic."
