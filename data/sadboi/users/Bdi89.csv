I've unfortunately already uncovered and dropped says down in all those sectors you recommended not to haha.

I've got about 8 miners and just got my first trader and just finished HQ mission at time of writing this post, as well as having added an energy cell product line (Teladi are screaming for it in my sector). 

The rest is fantastic advice and I'll be throwing a lot of credits towards getting my trader fleet growing. 

Also grind doesn't bother me. Prior to this I spent 100 hours in No Man's Sky looping between crafting and jumping, and much more than that on grinder games. I play to relax so it's fine looping through similar things and watching the empire grow :)"

But it's consistently helped me a lot for years on end and that, other than exacerbated psoriasis, is what I'll take for good-ish mental health and an otherwise very low side effect profile compares to many other drugs.

1. I become very interested in washing up (I fucking hate washing up and always piss and moan and complain about it otherwise, why the fuck would I enjoy thi - oh)
2. The volume on my car stereo/home speakers is consistently louder
3. In my bulletjournal, i go from making a couple of realistic goals for the week in bullet-point form, to endless tirades of stupidly complex and unrealistic goals for the next week
4. I mince my words. I really mince my words all the time on lamictal, but when mania is approaching I turn into a stutterer and cannot put two words together. I'm not flying high babbling incessantly just yet, ironically that comes when it's already too late. In a hypomanic state i end up more like [this kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sRuLfr22BE) (really fucking frustrating when you're a social worker and paid to have cogent conversations with people all day).

I never had insight into these warning signs until the umpteenth time I'd burnt my social life/career etc with mania and it was too late, so I decided to start taking notice. It took a long time. Both highs and lows can still creep right in under my radar though, and often do.

Mania definitely works on the same cognitive loops as you escalate as obsessive-compulsive/ADHD/anxiety related behaviours (all share similar neurological deficits in the frontal lobe) - I find it easier to monitor in terms of things like putting a sentence together, my capacity to sit still and finish a task versus just my emotional warning signs. I don't trust my emotions as good cues anymore, lol."

It's not an on-off switch for me - manic episodes pick up in pace over a while for me and there's a fair bit of warning period most of the time. It's just that I can't trust either that hypomanic state, a state of relative stability, euthymia or any other variation on not-depressed."

I think it's good to have something positive as a measure of consistency and focus, in my back pocket on a daily. But it's when I tread into territory of being \*obsessed\* that it actually becomes really harmful.
