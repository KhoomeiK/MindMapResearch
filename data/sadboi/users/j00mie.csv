Hey guys. I posted on here a few days ago. Not so scared it's gonna get in my water now.. (i know it's irrational) but I spent the whole day in tears. I was begging my dad to stay home, or telling him not to travel and being worried sick about him attending meetings. He is 69 years old. My mom is a nurse as well, but she is 11 years younger. This whole thing is terrifying to me because so many people think this isn't a serious thing and I feel like the media needs to be more matter of fact with more specifics. I heard that the virus doesn't leave the body for 37 or 38 days in the longest case? WHAT?! and it can leave damage? My family doesn't take this as seriously as I do at all.. and my brother and dad just cough away without covering their mouths. I am paralyzed to my room because as much as I love them I REALLY do not wanna get sick. I've been sanitizing like crazy. Im so scared of catching this. Im so scared of losing one of my family members. I lost both my grandpas this last year and my dad was septic.. this all happened during the summer. Im having a hard time accepting reality. I have never felt this paralyzed by anything in my life. I feel helpless. I have PTSD, anxiety, depression, BPD, and slight agoraphobia. I honestly don't feel like I can make it through this as a severely damaged person. It scares me so much to be traumatized yet again by another death or traumatic experience at all. I am deathly afraid of life now.. and I'm scared I'll never be able to feel calm again. I have learned some coping skills from DBT but it's so hard to use them right now. The fact the US congress is attempting to pass an encryption privacy bill while this is all going on slightly disturbs me, and makes me very suspicious. (Never been this paranoid) The lies make me sick. The media makes me sick. How careless and cruel some peoples attitudes are about this virus makes me sick. I honestly just might throw up from this whole ordeal at some point from stress. I know stress lowers your immune system, so I've been trying to play my Nintendo switch when I can. I have no masks or wipes because they were sold out everywhere. I should try meditating but then what.. what's the point? Im hopeless right now guys. Really hopeless.. this doesn't even feel like real life to me. Im dissociating like crazy into my phone, and experiencing derealization and depersonalization as well. I feel like my heart, mind, stomach, are all gonna explode. I can feel this deep sorrow for all the people who have lost their lives and their families. 

I just can't believe this is happening. If this mutates and becomes something worse I'm never leaving my house until that thing is eradicated. 

Thanks for reading loves.. I just needed to get this off my chest. 

Advice appreciated.

""The world will literally end if we break up and everyone will die."" He was a master manipulator. It was disturbing the things he would do and say to get your skin to crawl. He could control people by simply pissing them off or upsetting them. He definitely developed this tactic through his foster care. 

He drilled that shit into me for a year. He basically charles mansoned my ass because I started believing them after a while. He wouldn't let me deny them. He would have vague explanations as to what he was talking about but it scared the shit out of me. I truly thought we were all going to die.. and the end times were happening. 

Then comes the time when I wanted to be done with the nonsense once and for all cause I could feel myself literally losing my sanity. He would hide in my yard at night and he would put flowers on my car and on my deck just obnoxious amounts.. i caught him on camera at like 2 am putting a rose on my windshield... Fucking creepy. 

To this day I have to do trauma therapy because of this. 

When you see a red flag such as a delusion... RUN. 

Needless to say, i got a restraining order and created a huge case file of evidence against him in case he rejected it in court. 

He came into court in shackles because he had been arrested that morning for breaking the temp restraining order in place before the verdict.

Use lube when having sex, always. Feels better, doesn't break condoms.. less likely to get irritation.. or vaginal rips.

I would switch foods, but I've tried to in the past and he refuses to eat anything besides the food I have always fed him.. he literally would rather starve himself. Any recommendations for cat food?"
seniorkitties,fijdgnl,t1_fijd0vx,1582443148.0,"Thank you for easing my anxiety, seriously.  He doesn't look starved although he eats like he is. He's always going nuts when he's eating like he hasn't eaten in days but honestly it might be because he sleeps all day and is too lazy/ in pain from arthritis to get up and get food. When he is done half eating he goes and sleeps for a long time. He does look like just a young skinnier cat.. honestly he looks pretty healthy other than his limpy paw that hurts him all the time from arthritis. Poor Lil guy has to take gabepentin like every day now."

He almost died, and had I not found him when I did he would of. Im so sorry you have been through this. I know how sudden and scary it can be.

My condolences hun. 
I hope you're doing alright. ðŸ’œ"

AskReddit,fiijf45,t3_f7yk11,1582422267.0,"My grandpa always said ""you're the prettiest girl in your class.."" 

He developed dementia about 4 years ago.. and sadly passed away 2 days after Thanksgiving 2019. Ever since his disease progressed he hasn't said it since. 

I was rummaging through old birthday cards, and stumbled upon one from him when I was 16 years old before his dementia took him away. In the card, he said ""happy birthday honey.. you're still the prettiest girl in the class.""

I'll never forget him, or his cute little line."
AskReddit,fiihwft,t3_f7wvsg,1582421823.0,"Being someone with bpd, this is something I am an expert on given the consistent suicidal ideation. You definitely should be worried if they text you out of the blue saying ""I'm sorry.."" or just ""I love you."" That's when you need to spring into action. Leading up to it most likely they will be completely withdrawn.. emotional.. angry.. irritable. Another sign may be them being extremely pessimistic to everything you say or suggest in support. ""It will get better I promise!"" ""it never gets better. Im never getting better."" If you're worried about someone who is contemplating suicide I would get police involved. Most of the time they will be very angry with you at first, but then when they realize you saved their life they will be thankful. At least that's from my own personal experience with it."

WomensHealth,fi6cigf,t3_f6pr1k,1582188123.0,Idk how you even made it 4 years. I was in so much pain. I had it in for one year and sex was fine during but after I would get these HORRIBLE cramps. You're definitely not alone. I had to get it removed. I could eventually feel it being hit over and over during sex and it just made my skin crawl. There were many times I was moaning in pain after. If I were you I would just take it out for a year and do the pill or use condoms. Give your ovaries a break.
