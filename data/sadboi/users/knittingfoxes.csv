I'm starting to really take care of my body now but my KP is the one thing I can't seem to ""fix"". I've lost 35+lbs, I started dressing better, wearing makeup, doing my hair, moisturizing and keeping up with hygiene, etc. so it's frustrating to have this one ""ugly"" part of my body that I can't hide. My arms always have scabs from those deep ingrown hair ones. I always have to get the darn hair out!! 

I luckily don't pick/pop every day but I think my picking gets worse with stress because like I said, it's calming. I had a super deep ingrown hair one on my forearm and I spent two separate times trying to pluck the hair out but now that I got it out, I have this huge scab and it's all red.

Whether that be hard drive in your computer, or flash drive, or even cloud storage platform. Cloud storage is MUCH more reliable than one hard drive because these companies build redundancy in and are CONSTANTLY swapping hard drives, but they still rely on two things that aren't guaranteed: access to the internet, and the cloud storage company providing you access to your files. To be extra redundant, cloud storage on one or more services plus two or more hard drive/flash drive backups with at least one copy being on an internal hard drive (anything external is easier to lose).

Trust me though, because of the nature of how it blends in, neither would be completely unusable for you. I still plan on using up my G10 but G11 was just a better match."
glossier,fpl67ut,t1_fpjtx55,1588707088.0,"Not OP, but I just got and started using skin tint and wowder and I'm really happy with them. I thought I would be G11 but it had been out of stock for SO long I just settled for G10 skin tint and G11 stretch concealer. Next day I was browsing the website (quarantine probs) and saw G11 was back in stock. I ordered G11 too. When G10 got here yesterday, it still worked but I could tell the undertones just weren't correct for my skin. G11 got here today and it's much better. I'm still going to use up my G10 but G11 ended up being better. In terms of picking shade I would definitely still try to pick a lightness or darkness that matches your skin, but focus more on undertones as it really does change the look.

As for the skin tint itself, it goes on really nice but also absorbs into your skin like a nice moisturizer while not being greasy. Because of this though, I do worry it will get used up fast. I'd love some input from someone who has gone through a few bottles to let me know how long they last. The concealer will last me much longer though I think. The skin tint kind of is exactly that, a skin tint. It kind of evens out your skin a bit and and really complements your natural skin. If you like a full coverage look, this isn't for you but I'm sure you already know that. Stretch concealer is great for those spots where you need just a bit more coverage and I use it under my eyes and at the corners of my mouth to just even me out a bit more. Concealer builds great though and I'd definitely recommend getting the bundle of those two. 

Wowder is also great. I like how it dispenses because you don't end up
with loads on the brush and its easy to shake any excess off and save it for later. Doesn't smell fantastic or anything but definitely not bad. I feel like it finishes the skin tint and concealer perfectly though and leaves my skin feeling soft and not too matte looking."

Now though, every delivery person I've got with them has been awesome. They take photos of where they left your package and email it to you. The delivery people I've gotten with them are usually new immigrants (I assume, not sure) and they are all super nice and caring. 

As for Canada Post, my dad ordered a really big rack computer and they didn't even attempt to deliver it. They left a pickup notice for the next day but my dad knew it was bulky so he called the post office right away to see if he could pick it up when the truck got back.

Noom,fm5ks9m,t1_fm0x5fc,1585774786.0,"100% for me, it's the lessons they have every day. I have depression and anxiety and struggle a lot with positive thinking I guess you could say. When I tried diets in the past and then couldn't keep up with them, I blamed myself. I told myself I would never be able to lose weight, etc. 

Noom crushes that right away. Their food ""scoring"" system is green, yellow, and red foods. They tell you from the beginning that red foods aren't bad in the same way that green foods aren't necessarily good. It's all about how calorie dense the foods are, and they allot green, yellow, and red foods within your day.

The key for me personally has been not letting myself feel guilty about ANYTHING. Totally broke my diet and ate an entire pizza? Log it. I look at how I ate 3000 calories that day, I accept it, and I move on. No guilt, no shame, no ""I won't do it again"" because I probably will. For me, not letting myself feel any guilt has been extremely hard but it's what I attribute to my success so far. 

Noom's lessons have been a great addition to that mindset though and to my therapy sessions that I attend. I've actually found that a lot of Noom's lessons are similar to things my therapist has taught. So the daily lessons along with the way food is ""scored"" has been been my favourite part. I also am really happy with my coach, but I know that is hit or miss for some people. Remember though that you can always request a new coach or group at any time."

That's why I stated that my parents are okay with it. Parents and their children will all have different relationships and parents will all have different values. This is what works for my family and it won't work for everyone. Also, if I do happen to get pregnant even taking the proper precautions, abortion is still an option. While I wouldn't want to be put in that situation, hence why I'm taking birth control, I understand it's still a possibility. 

If you think the fact that my parents love my boyfriend and I and are okay with us being able to sleep together in the comfort of my home is ""rachet af"", then that is fine. I know that when I have children, if they're in a safe and loving relationship and they want to have sex in the safety of my home, I will allow it.

We enjoy ourselves and we share that passionate intimate part of life together which I think is a beautiful thing. 

I don't think sex has to be a ""dirty"" thing and I think it is beautiful in a loving, committed relationship. I don't think having a loving, committed relationship is exclusive to just people over 18 but as always, depends on the people.

TLCUnexpected,flm2x26,t1_flm0xjp,1585273340.0,"Very true. If two people are willing to make a baby or not willing to prevent it, it can happen. I'm glad even though you are religious/went to church that you were able to get access to birth control and were educated in preventing pregnancy. 

My boyfriend's dad was adopted because his birth parents parents had him at 14 or 15 I think, so he had a very uncomfortable ""sex talk"" with my boyfriend when we started dating. His parents are still religious and quite traditional (he's from southern US vs me in Canada) so when I'm down there I stay in a hotel with my mom out of respect for his family. 

I wasn't raised Catholic but I went to a Catholic elementary and high school and while we got generally decent sex education because it was mandated by the government, it still wasn't nearly enough and I'm thankful I had my parents (specifically my mom) to talk to about any questions. She's a nurse as well so that helps. When I was 15 she bought me a vibrator.  I think this idea that masturbation is ""dirty"" is another contributor to teen pregnancy. Give kids a safe space and all the tools and education they need to learn about their bodies, sex, relationships, and consent. Teen pregnancies will always happen but at least that would make them much less likely."
TLCUnexpected,fllxv8v,t3_fpm607,1585270066.0,"My boyfriend sleeps in my room. I'm 20 and living at home but he has been since we were like 15. To be fair, we're in a long distance relationship and have been for nearly 6 years so when he comes here a few times a year, it makes no sense to pay for a hotel for him. My parents are totally okay with it and my mom and I are very open with each other. I'm on birth control though and I've been taking it religiously since I was 13. I think this comes down to not being educated on sex and birth control methods and possibly the girls WANTING to get pregnant. I really value having time alone with my boyfriend to just cuddle and sometimes yes, have sex, but pretty much all we do at night is sleep. When we have sex it's usually when my parents are out of the house just out of respect. If kids are going to have sex, they'll do it whenever. They'll get better at hiding and parents might even catch them having sex which is just uncomfortable for everyone. It's easy to blame teenagers getting pregnant on them being able to easily have sex. 

Where I agree with you is saying they should have done something BEFORE. They should have had an open dialogue with their kids (male and female) about sex and relationships and how to prevent pregnancy."

TLCUnexpected,fklsquu,t1_fkl4fpv,1584313770.0,I watched 90 day fianc√© from season 1 because I've been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend in the US for nearly 6 years now. It got so dumb I had to stop watching. I think it's because I'm in a long distance relationship myself that their idiocy annoys me so much. I still love the drama of Unexpected though.

LongDistance,fk96b84,t1_fk82h83,1583969597.0,"I've booked a flight for my SO in May, trip for us to Disney in July, and possibly a trip for my friend to come visit me in August and NONE of us are worried. This is the problem with this mass hysteria. People aren't living their lives out of fear. 

My mom works in a major US hospital and they've been testing for six strains of corona virus for YEARS as part of standard testing. It's the same as if we're having a particularly bad year of a specific strain of influenza, just obviously the mortality rate of those infected is about 8x the rate of the flu which is why it IS important that it is contained. I'd only be mildly concerned if you're travelling to, and staying in a very big city. I'd also places like Italy right now just because of the higher than average rates of the virus. 

Regardless, what people aren't talking about is the rate of people who have already been cured. Also, the mortality rate for people in my age range (early 20's) is 0.2% of people who are infected and it's going to kill those who are already immune compromised, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy and the elderly. 

I could go on for ages but you get it.

EDIT: Just want to say I understand the severity of this virus but a lot of the precautions people are taking aren't necessary. I am flying within the continental US, and I understand why people may take extra precautions if flying outside of their own country. Be smart, wash your hands, if you feel sick get checked out and wear a mask. Just don't put your entire life on hold and don't panic. Panic does no one good."
ILC,fk6jv4d,t1_fk5dst3,1583904385.0,"I used to be super guilty that I was only taking one course but every. single. person. I've told about my concerns just reassured me that everyone does things at their own pace and to not worry at all. I used to be a total perfectionist, straight-A student though and I thought ""dropping out"" was just for ""bad"" kids so when I couldn't return to school, it felt like my world came crashing down on me. Obviously, I'm older and more mature than I was at 13 and I realize now that people ""drop out"" or delay school for SO MANY reasons. Through my time dealing with my original high school, they told me that school is designed rigid so that if you can make it through, that's great, but if you can't they develop another path for you. The admin at my old school said that a lot of their time is spent finding alternatives for all the kids like me, who don't fit into the traditional school path. 

Anyway, thank you for your comment because it's also nice to see other people who have the same issues as me trying to finish high school. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
TLCUnexpected,fk4q0to,t1_fk2e69q,1583865345.0,Season 1 I actually liked her. I watched her on Youtube before the show was even announced and she's the reason I watched it. Season 3 she just got SO much worse. I can't stand watching her now. I was rooting for her at first too.
Noom,fk4cb4l,t3_fgbqgj,1583857637.0,I was super skeptical of Noom at first because no diet has EVER worked for me. I'm on week 6 and down 21lbs. Just try and keep your spirits up as much as you can because I've found that really helps with having motivation. Also don't ever deprive yourself and log EVERYTHING! Good luck :))

LongDistance,fk004x6,t3_ffknjy,1583735823.0,Oh my gosh! Brings back memories. This was my boyfriend and I almost 5 years ago when we pulled up outside his house after 9 months of dating online. We're now on almost 6 years LDR.

RDO has been surprisingly pleasant most of the time and I've even met a few respectful guys in my time playing, but I've also gotten a few bad apples. The hackers are the *worst*. The weird sexualization gets way worse when they can teleport you off the map and send an entire city to attack you. I hope R* read my damn report because that one guy was a dick."
LongDistance,fjq70rf,t1_fjpnz9x,1583568831.0,"Yes! Then when you DO get to see them, you spend the rest of the visit being sad and being reminded that this is temporary and they leave again in X days and then back to not being with them. Also the struggle of when they're with you, wanting to spend every second doing things with them and snuggling with them and everything being wonderful, but also needing to live your life and go get groceries and run errands and boring stuff. It's also hard because you spend so much time apart, that sometimes being so ""together"" can cause fights or arguments that you have to work past. Then when they leave your bed just feels empty and you just feel EMPTY for a few weeks until you ""get used"" to not being with them. The time right before, during, and right after a visit is exciting, exhausting, sad, lonely, happy, frustrating, and about every emotion a person can imagine. There's almost an element of grief when they leave.

&#x200B;

Then there's also the fear of breaking up and getting no closure. It could just be done, and you might not be over them, and you NEVER get to see them again. My current SO broke up with me once four years ago and it was the most sickening feeling you can imagine. Nothing to grasp onto. No closure. Just never seeing them ever again. Of course we happened to get back together a month later but that time where I was still madly in love with him and thought I would never see him again was a period of complete grief for me. It was as if he had died and it was a horribly sickening feeling. I wouldn't recommend anyone try to have a long distance relationship and it should only be done out of necessity."

I obviously kept it for quite a while but as soon as an opportunity came up to switch, I got an 11"". It's much more portable (fits in my purse) and I don't feel like I've ""lost"" anything at all. I feel like I've gained a portability that I didn't have before. It's also much easier to prop up in my left hand in times where I don't have a stand and I feel a lot less fatigue from holding it. It's also easier to maneuver when I have it in bed. Absolutely happy with my change in size."

Sleeves are usually made with a tiny bit of wiggle room so you should be fine. If you aren't sure, I'd go to Walmart or Best Buy and just hold your iPad up in front of a sleeve and make sure it will fit with a little bit of room around it. Good luck!"
ILC,fjjgo4n,t3_ekcrx5,1583395216.0,I know this post is quite old but I'll share in case anyone else comes by to read this. I was a straight A student through elementary school and got high 90's in my first semester of high school. I had unknown and untreated depression and anxiety though and between first and second semester I had a complete mental break. Six years later and I'm now 20 and only have 10 credits. I've gotten six of those slowly since I was in real high school back in 2013. I have goals in life and I want to go to university so of course I am going to finish high school. The last six years has been a LOT of rebuilding my life and healing my mental health and I'm finally in a place where I'm excelling in school again. My mental health had to come first unfortunately and now I'm quite behind. Better late than never though and I'm a much stronger person because of what I've been through. :)

disabled,fjcrf4e,t3_fcoimw,1583233540.0,"I have Erb's Palsy so one sided partial arm paralysis and limited range of mobility. I love bras that do up in the front. I'd also love a bra with straps that I could adjust myself so preferably from the front. You have no idea how many times I've had to use my teeth to adjust my bra straps or get help. Another commented mentioned high waist pants and I totally agree with that even though mine is probably more of a personal fit preference than a disability need. I will say though I would love stretchy jeans that are stretchy in the band so they can be slipped on, but have the decorations such as buttons. I love the look of buttons on my jeans but it's so hard to do up buttons on jeans because I have limited strength in my arm and hand grip strength to do up buttons, especially when squeezing into my beloved skinny jeans. I also have a large-ish scar over my collar bone so the best tip I could recommend is limited/zero tags. My skin around my scar is super sensitive and even just my arm in general is sensitive. When I was a kid I used to cut all the tags off my clothes because they drove me CRAZY. I love when shirts have a soft material and use some sort of printed on tag information or just no tags in general. Soft materials are a must especially for people like me with nerve injuries. Good luck and keep us updated! :)"

It wouldn't have seemed possible. I've only ever tried diets for a couple days and then cracked because they were too strict. I'm not shaming myself about any decisions I make and when I have slipped up, I got right back on track because I didn't feel shamed.
