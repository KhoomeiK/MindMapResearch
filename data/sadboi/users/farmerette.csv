TalkTherapy,f8ma3kj,t1_f8lwkbm,1574629529.0,"this.  and because of it, I would suggest that you hint or kind-of-ask, like 'i'd like to draw something nice for you, but wasn't sure if it would be awkward or if you would feel ok with me giving it to you?'  You don't have to spoil the surprise by telling him what it is.  :)"
TalkTherapy,f8kouz4,t3_e0tiv2,1574613500.0,"I find that recovering from a relationship with someone who is abusive takes a long time - years, even, before you (general you, not you-you) get strong enough to see where the boundaries, etc get broken and how to have the strength to stand up for yourself.  I'm not trying to be mean, but I do see where diving back in before you've built yourself up sufficiently with the same person is harmful and would be a sign to your therapist that you aren't committed to taking care of yourself - just the sheer comparison of contact hours with your abusive boyfriend is going to overwhelm the hour every so often that your therapist spends building you up, and you will go backwards again, and you will suffer but there isn't an effective strategy your therapist can use to help you if you decide to go that way.  If you are crying as you go back to your boyfriend, to me that is a huge red flag!  You are just beginning your recovery, but aren't giving yourself a chance.  It's ultimately your decision, but just don't be harsh on your therapist - you asked for his/her outside perspective and help, but are declining to take him/her up on it, and I would see where they would feel like their hands are tied in terms of helping you.

&#x200B;

edit: imagine yourself as someone who is hitting themselves with a hammer and asking someone (your therapist) to help yourself stop, but when the person (therapist) actually starts trying to help, you tell him you'd rather ignore him and keep hitting yourself with a hammer.  What else can he do except leave you to your own methods to figure it out that you should stop?

again, not bashing on you, I have great respect for you as you weigh out the situation -  I think you are much stronger than you think, but since I'm a stranger, I'll just say I think you should seriously reconsider your decision - you have the envious position of having chance to get out of an abusive situation now, with real support, before things get much much worse, and believe me they will.  You will look back on this point someday and wish you had done it differently.

edit again: also it is NOT your responsibility to keep your boyfriend's personality disorder in check.  That is  ridiculous and abusive for him to assign that to you, because he will attack you later on that very thing.  His behavior is his to manage - and it's something that only his going to therapy would help with.  You have barely started in helping yourself, and you are pretty much stating that you don't have the skills to help yourself yet, so how could you possibly manage his abusive tendencies as well?  

Again, not trying to roast you - but I've grown up in and lived in abusive situations and I really really hate to see someone else go through that, especially by choice."
TalkTherapy,f8kn0jt,t3_e0rd8f,1574612944.0,"I've had serious issues also with religious-based counselors, and I was also a minor at the time.  It was very threatening and abusive and very scary, along with other things in my life.  It took 25 years of ups and downs and gradually changing/worsening life circumstances and mental health and trying out various therapists and ditching them all after just one session before I finally got connected with a therapist who was a trauma specialist.  Even just going and telling him about how horrible that religious therapy was brought on a really harsh (freeze) response for me, that he wound up having to spend extra time helping me out of - I was just completely stuck reliving the overwhelming trauma therapy experience from before.  But from all the folks I've worked with before he has been the only person who has the training to deal with previous things like that, and the only one I felt like opening up to - it's been a year now of twice weekly sessions, and I feel like I am finally at a place where I really trust him.  I've had a lot of just basic things to work through about therapy itself and that relationship.  Trust is built over the little things - you don't have to disclose a ton to 'test the waters.' It's something that hopefully builds naturally over time and positive experiences - don't do what I did and just dive right in to the deep stuff.   you'll just find yourself backing off in shock, and having to recover from that before you can get back to it.  

I only say all that because I hope you don't waste as many years as I did in feeling lost and distrustful of help.  Once you have the chance (maybe have to fight through the years as a minor and then later when you have a job, find your resources to get what you need) -  find yourself a good therapist that specializes in trauma (not 'trauma informed therapy') and you will hopefully have a much better experience processing not just whatever you need to process in the first place, but also the whole prior therapy experience.  I really, really wish someone had told me there were therapists out there like that.   
 A trauma specialty is important - mine did his post-doc at a VA, but now is in private group practice and works with civilians like me.  I am very lucky to have found him, but I guess I would just emphasize that you can also work with someone like him before you get to the end of your rope like I did (I was actively suicidal).   I am sorry you are going through this right now with the religious counselors - they are certainly the worst of the bunch as far as I have experienced.  But as far as therapy goes in general, go for it.  There are some really good, outstanding therapists out there that really want to help, and they are patient and amazing enough to actually do that.  I hope you find what you need sometime, just don't write them all off - I did that and could have saved myself a couple decades of misery if only I had known."
schizophrenia,f8f8q3d,t3_e0m9ba,1574539954.0,"this is a big decision for you - I get the weight of it.  If you are raising kids, they will benefit from your strengths but will push you to want to grow in ways you never imagined or wanted to before - and also they push you that way whether you want to or not.  The answer to whether parenting is positive is...it depends.  Everybody's story is different, so strangers' stories may be informative, but they won't be *yours,* as in, your story is not going to be theirs in hindsight with the advantages of 20/20.  I'm sure there are people who have chosen different routes and they can speak more to how it worked for them, but remember this is just the interenet, so yours may be similar or gloriously better or hearwrenchingly worse than theirs, whatever your decision is.  How you will see your experience depends on you, and on the kid, and on the folks who surround you and support you - something that may be really easy for you may be pretty much impossible for me.  Whatever you decide, I'm sure folks here would support you.  I am hesitant to share my experiences in that regard because I am such a stranger to you and your life and situation - that is a heavy thing for me too to feel like I am influencing your decision.  Having children has so much potential to either go amazing, or normal, or heartbreaking, or tough, or the most wonderful thing in your life - it is drastically different for everyone, and every kid is different too - they could be 'easy' babies or cry a lot, or have health challenges.  Whether you feel like you are in a place to ride the unknown waves of that experience is only something you can know.  It is a long journey to raise another person into an adult that can function in society and feel that they belong.  No parents are perfect, but many mean well and do their best and that is all anyone could ask of them.  Rather than give you my experience to compare to, I would gently suggest to set aside some time to think about it and make a decision that you are satisfied with and can move forward with in confidence that you made the best decision you could.  I would even say to take some days off if you can to really give yourself the time if you think you need it - and if you still need advice, and if you have people you can trust the most and talk to them about it.  I get that you are looking for input, I hope I'm not at all dampening that search, I'm just not the best person to talk to in terms of whether parenting is a positive thing or not, or 'if I could do it again, would I.'   I hope that others will chime in if they can help more, and I hope that you find your way, and that it brings you peace."

schizophrenia,f8bbx5s,t3_dzvmyn,1574433053.0,"I started training my dog for this.  But then I just lost steam, and also got to the point of finally being able to go out to the store, and such - and complete short errands without completely falling apart (like winding up just sitting on the floor of the store hiding my head - not as bad if you're in target, harder in the grocery store - wound up just panicking and leaving the store without finishing my list).  

Part of the change for me was tons of therapy (twice a week) with someone that I clicked with.  Part of it was that training my dog required that I go out in public - leash training, socializing, and such.  That really pushed me beyond my comfort level, but it also made it so I can complete my errands (I'm a stay-at-home mom).  It's at the point now where most of the places I go with the kids (soccer practice, etc) I can take her without having to go all the way through a certification program, so I dropped out of the program.  Another reason I decided to stop as I got better, was noticing and hearing stories about people who do not respect how service dogs are supposed to be left alone to work - maybe that would not happen where I live, but I like keeping a really low profile in public and the idea that having her with me in certain places would raise my profile really started to bother me.  She keeps me grounded, and breaks up my moods, gives me confidence that I am ok, and helps me know what is real and what is not.  

You can totally train your own dog.  It is a commitment, but it is worth it if you need it.  I signed up to work with a place called compass key.  You do not have to go through a program in the US.  You do have to meet certain standards, and you should be able to answer the question of what is your dog trained to do (what 'service' they do) and usually you are expected to have 3 answers - calming anxiety, stopping self-harm, etc.  In the US, you do not have to pay anyone to register your dog, nor do you have to even have them wear certain gear.  But your dog is certainly expected to behave according to certain standards.  It is helpful to me to know that if I decided to, I could finish out her training as a service dog myself at this point.  Meeting with a trained trainer though that I paid for through compass key was very enlightening though, it helped me see things through a different lens as far as training goes and really speeds things up.  I would recommend them as a group."

To me, it seems like it happens more and more now to me, that whenever I meet with a new authority figure in my life (even drs) that is going to have some sort of opinion, it throws me entirely into the 'they are not going to believe my story' and an extreme state - last year was awful and I wound up in the psych ward for SI.  This year I'm 'better' in that I haven't shut myself in my room for weeks on end, but now since I can't just shutting down, my mind has started scrambling.  I have no idea what next time around will bring whenever that is, but I can't imagine it will be pleasant.

I would sit and stare at it when that hit and just be kind of paralized thinking....""is THIS feeling bad enough to warrant taking this now?  I mean I could walk across the room if I wanted to right?  how exactly does one define high anxiety or panic attacks?  would my psychiatrist think this counts?  should I wait an hour and see how it goes, or should I have taken it 20 minutes ago?  It won't start working for a little while, maybe I can just chill myself out by that time anyway.""  Meds can be sooooo frustrating."
TalkTherapy,f7we25o,t1_f7vzxa2,1574032399.0,"actually, these sound like really good ideas.  I will bring them up with folks, of course generally reinforcing things with my kids, and particularly the one with my T - will probably try to find a way to bring that one up tomorrow."
TalkTherapy,f7vwfdj,t1_f7vtzjd,1574027663.0,"Thanks, so much to absorb!  
In thinking about it, my kids are young (7 and 5), and they have never met him, so I worry about him somehow managing a way to run into them, even if not to molest, somehow to twist up their minds or whatever, I don't know, just mess with their lives or whatever (imagine a man who does not possess compassion).  

As far as myself is concerned - I am not very stable still in a lot of things  right now - thoughts, behaviors.  I think my T gets that I'm trying very hard to improve, but things could totally be construed if taken out of context.  All my dad would have to do, as I understand it, is call the police and tell them things that he 'heard me say.'  As a relative, it would look like he is so kindly concerned.  I guess I should look up the laws in my state."
Psychosis,f7vqaea,t1_f7voyzc,1574026087.0,thank you.  (just edited a little of my last answer to explain myself better.)  being able to write on this sub helps too.  thanks for listening.
TalkTherapy,f7voq8d,t1_f7vn9of,1574025645.0,"worst case scenario, he'd find a way to create trouble for my husband, or molest my kids, find a way to get me committed again (last year my T convinced me to go voluntarily because I was completely suicidal).  My dad once had my mom involuntarily committed before I was born - given the circumstances she probably just needed rest, not that.

My therapist only works 2 days a week, so our agreement is that if I get hospitalized again, then he would ethically have to refer me out (still within the group practice) for more care than he can provide.  I don't think I would be able to start over, so if my dad did that, it would leave me...pretty much screwed."
Psychosis,f7vnuyi,t1_f7vlee4,1574025489.0,"that's a good idea.  I'll have to imagine that first before tomorrow , I feel like I'm starting to get afraid of everywhere... :("
Psychosis,f7vm4qe,t1_f7vl3cj,1574024963.0,"I see what you are saying, but only grudgingly.  I'll talk to my therapist tomorrow, before changing anything.  I wish this whole thing wasn't here to basically turn everything into a huge trust issue between me and the rest of the world including my therapist and my psychiatrist.  Any other time, I'd be more likely to want to listen.  I'm going to have to make myself, and I can't even trust myself anymore since the whole thing looks stupid on paper and nobody is going to believe me, but that's what the whole thing is about - my dad gets away with stuff that no one would believe, simply because no one would believe it."
Psychosis,f7vkklq,t1_f7vaygz,1574024553.0,"that sounds reasonable.  All my lines are blurred though on when to ask and what to ask for help with - it sounds like maybe this would count, but I somehow feel like it would be weak to avoid the whole thing, kind of like meds would be the easy way out for me, and somehow I need to be fully conscious of ALL the pain in order to really do whatever it takes to get rid of it.  It makes me feel like I should even quit the mood stabilizer I'm on so I can really dig at the wound.  That probably isn't a good idea, and my logic probably doesn't even make any sense."
TalkTherapy,f7vi9gp,t1_f7u4xa9,1574023948.0,"Thank you for this - it gives me a lot to think about.  the numbers thing helps some - but I wind up automatically breaking it down between 0 for proof and 10 for needing to be aware it is just like my dad to do something like this, and my T is only left at the 8.  arg.  

I don't think I've ever gotten to the point of trusting someone quite the same (good) way as I trust my T, and it probably isn't even all that much, in a purely objective measure. (I trusted my granddad very much, but in a different way).  I guess this all just feels like it throws everything back to the beginning - he doesn't believe me so why trust him?  Like, who's side is he on anyway? -which is just entirely not even a fair question.  But he does have that good track record you are talking about...

I think you are right though, in the last paragraphs, the whole thing has over-activated the suspicious/scared/untrusting parts are like, what on earth have you been doing, self?'  But for the sake of feeling like I'm surviving, I can't *not* listen to them.   

It doesn't help that I don't even trust the idea of seeing my psychiatrist and taking medicines.  She is the next door down in the hallway, and I used to like her, she is the one that connected me to this T, but now I don't even want to see her or take anything at all - I feel like it will only make things worse and cloud my judgement and mess things up.  however, I haven't stopped the one Rx she gave me, and I'm supposed to see her again at the turn of the year because I had to make contact and she was like - we're way overdue for a session! I've just been avoiding her by having the pharmacy call in the refills instead of doing it myself.  

I have an appt to see my T tomorrow.  I feel terrible that all I can think to do is go in and be a pathetic, distrusting blob that doesn't want to talk about anything because I can't see a way forward.   So now, on top of everything else, I pity my T.  At least he only has to put up with me for 50 minutes twice a week.  Here's an 'ug, sorry' to all you poor therapists who have to deal with people like me."
TalkTherapy,f7vcru4,t1_f7v1tnd,1574022633.0,"You are right.  Part of me says why even try to work through this? Like I should just go with going back to feeling watched and hunted all the time.  Because I know my T doesn't shift into fears like this about the office.  So if he doesn't believe me, why should I ask him to even try and understand?  And more than that, why would I ever *want* someone to understand how completely awful my dad was?  There's no way my T could believe me unless he could know how it was/is, but there is no way to know how it was/is without believing me...It just feels like maybe I should just ignore the whole thing for the sake of saving myself and him the trouble of working to find out how to communicate.  Like maybe it's just better to live with the misery of who I am and the life I grew up with.  But then if I can't figure it out, why even stay in therapy? 

Sorry, I just keep winding up going in logic-circles...."

TalkTherapy,f7tapvc,t1_f7sj1mo,1574002682.0,thanks for this.  I am lost as to how to overcome it.  Maybe he will have some skill?  I guess this is likely going to take up a significant chunk of therapy to work through.
TalkTherapy,f7t9lkz,t1_f7r2n94,1574002334.0,"I haven't talked to my dad since I was 13, that was 25 years ago.  Didn't stop him then from tracking everyone like he had some right to do that.  Nobody's ever stopped him or stood up to him.  Excuse the analogy if it's offensive, but he got away with things very similar to the way the current US president\* has - the past few years of politics has been a trigger in and of itself to see the same patterns repeated, on varioius national levels.  Only my dad wasn't dumb like that, so *everybody* liked him and *nobody believed* us.  Talk about growing up with a bunch of crazy making."
TalkTherapy,f7t810w,t1_f7qyaxy,1574001772.0,"thanks, it just feels really hard to get the feeling across.  If I could do that, I think it would be easy to believe, but still there's just nothing to be done about it."
TalkTherapy,f7t7vjt,t1_f7qr4q9,1574001721.0,"thanks.  I've tried to tell him that it was bad, but my dad's levels of manipulation and selfishness my dad was is just truly difficult to describe, and even harder for anyone who hasn't lived through it to believe; I'm not sure he *can* get it.  How can he help if he doesn't get it, how it feels to be hunted/stalked for years on end?"
TalkTherapy,f7t3gn6,t1_f7qgg4i,1574000613.0,"I'm usually think of him as on my team, but it's suddenly getting harder.  More backstory: the 'therapists' we saw at the time this was all going on back in the day never believed us about the very real abuse issues and only made things worse - they were truly awful.  So now I am starting to feel the whole tornado again - I feel like he is going to be just like them, even though I've spent a year just working  up to enough trust to even talk about this with him.  It feels so irrational.  Total clusterfuck and I have no idea how to sort it out."
Psychosis,f7swjb5,t1_f7qemu4,1573998845.0,I'm glad that went away!  That sounds like the ideal situation - where coping actually works!
Psychosis,f7swbn6,t1_f7rymoa,1573998773.0,"Thanks.  I can't believe anyone else has been through anything so similar.  The person who would have the place bugged would be my dad, who is just such a twisted and evil person, full of gaslighting and crazy-making techniques.  I'm almost 40, haven't talked to him in 25 years, and am still feeling it.  Going through some other things, and it's been intense - I started seeing people in my head, that I know aren't real, but they are really real to me, and very disturbing how they interact without my control of them.  Plus this issue.  I think I have crossed over the edge, and I can't see the way back anymore. I guess at least it is happened in real time in therapy - nothing worse than taking your car/self to the mechanic/therapist and it not doing the thing wrong that you went in for."
TalkTherapy,f7qekbb,t1_f7qbdpw,1573962771.0,"I probably will...I have a family and they expect me to.  it's just hard to go when one of my core issues is not being believed, and I'm not believed.  How could he possibly do anything to help me get through this if he doesn't believe it too?  I consider myself normally a very rational person, but to me this is very rational also, given my family."

I will - might take me a bit to figure out how to do this - I don't have a printer and this will be the first time I've tried to 'make' a temporary tattoo, but it *looks* like it should be pretty easy to have done, especially if I take the right paper to an affordable print shop like the UPS Store here in the US."

Thought about just doing it, but since I know you are the artist, I kind of feel weird about doing it without asking.  Feel free to say no, though, that's ok too.  At least this has given me an idea of a coping strategy - I could just draw whatever comes to mind or doodle with a pen."

You may be able to find something to drench the soil with to kill the larvae etc, but they are hard to get rid of.  Another option is to repot the plants in fresh soil, but make sure to get rid of *all* the old dirt first, even wash off the plant roots, and such.  

Hopefully this will help your peace of mind if nothing else!  :)  Things happen, plants and dirt get bugs.  It's life."
