She said I could contact her when I feel like it, but I didn’t want to so I didn’t assured her I would talk to her again.

asktrp,fnxz94v,t3_g4j2vg,1587349641.0,"My ex told friends and family a bunch of lies, because I didn’t want the relationship anymore. Here is how you deal with it: fuck it. If someone asks, just say she lied and that you don’t care because she is crazy. Don’t give attention to it, do not give explanations to people, or show you are concerned. It will only make it look like it’s real. If people bought what she said, fuck them, it’s their problem. You don’t need to try and explain your part of the story, only if someone asks. This was months ago and people don’t even think about that stuff anymore. Not going to lie, i lost 2 good friends because of what she did. But in the end, they chose to believe her and not me, without not even asking to hear my say first. So meh, it was probably for the best"

I do believe I could be better next time, now that I realized what went wrong. I’m afraid I’m definitely losing her if I don’t reach out. She wanted to meet up but I kind of refused. I just let it go. I tried one time to talk to her about wanting to come back, but she said she couldn’t do this/wasn’t ready. At the same time she keeps saying all this stuff. My impression is that she is expecting me to change for the better, and to go after her. But I could be wrong, and mess everything up by contacting her."

She never trusted this much on somebody, and I was her first really serious relationship. But I did some bad things. I never wanted to get to know her family and friends because they were all very rich and spoiled people, it made me feel bad about myself and my situation (I’m very, very poor compared to them)I see now that I was overreacting.I deeply regret this. There is more stuff, but I can’t write it all.So she is actually right about wanting to break up."
