She thinks her small butt is not getting her enough opportunities. She also goes on to say how all instagram models are fake and basic looking but they have big fake asses and therefore get more opportunities than her.

My Netflix account got hacked then my Google password was changed. It was a freaking mess. Took me a while to get it straightened out. I know it all started from POF because that the first app that got hacked. The password changed then my pictures got deleted and some Asians girl pics were posted. My Google alert kept saying that my account was being used in the Dominican Republic so that's where the culprit was from. Anyways, be careful about giving out your phone number or texting a given number on POF. That dating app is full of scammers just asking for phone numbers. Good luck everyone."

TrueCrime,fem6p5b,t3_epsq0e,1579241686.0,"Seen this on Dailymail and made my heart sank. Thank God they found her. These stories are always the worst for me. When I was about 10-11 years old I almost made a big mistake of getting into a stranger's car myself. I was stupid and argued with my parents over something and thought that I would punish them by running away from home. At around 9pm I ran out of the house and started walking in one direction as far from home as possible. When I got by a park called Chopin Park (if anyone is from Chicago) a black Toyota Corolla stopped next to me by a stop sign and a guy started asking me if I needed a ride. He even said that it's dangerous out here and that he can take me anywhere I wanted so jump in!. As I was walking to his car a teenager from the park that was sitting on a bench smoking something yelled to the guy to ""fuck off pervert!"" Or at least that's what I remember it. The guy sped off pretty fast. Anyways, I didn't thank that teen I just ran off myself and after a couple of hours of walking I went back home and nobody even noticed I was gone. I would def thank him today if I met him. I hope he knows he did a very good thing. I don't know why I'm sharing this but yeah."
