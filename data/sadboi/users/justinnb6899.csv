SuicideWatch,ff8jvum,t1_ff7io62,1579681931.0,Tbh i think I’d prefer the poetry to stay the same lol
SuicideWatch,ff65lta,t3_eqy2fj,1579619690.0,"Depression. It’s such a tease. You get these highs. It comes back with ease. 

You wake up everyday. You beg and you beg. Let today be the day. I turn my life around please. 

As the money gets lower. The debts get higher. The oxygen runs out. And so does the fire. 

You’re left there. Thinking of all the moments you wish you could fix. The rooms silent. The clock ticks. There you go again. Wishing you had super powers. I mean you day dream about the shit for hours and hours. 

Truth is. I can’t fix the past. It’ll never get better. These highs they’re light like a feather but these lows could rip leather and this life is the worst weather it’s cold and warm never I just. Want. To be. Better. 

It’s hard not to feel like I have a curse. It gets better. And immediately worse. Than ever before. I mean honestly. In my heart. In my mind. I know where happiness I find. It’s me. Who makes me blind. I know exactly how to ease my mind. Some need meds. Some need someone to call. I. Just need to end it all. 

But tomorrow I’ll wake up and continue with this disease. Because depression is such a tease.  Here’s a comment with the poem for those who can’t see."

SuicideWatch,ff17fre,t1_ff0sxp4,1579476018.0,It’s a life long battle. People expect you to just get this or that and be better. If therapy was helping. Go back. Even when it’s not a low.

SuicideWatch,ff16vpt,t1_fezix17,1579475831.0,Yes I do. This one was on the spot tho. Not a lot of revision. Surprised people liked it so much.
SuicideWatch,ff16m5n,t1_feyu4jr,1579475736.0,Yes. Up late so I decided to write.
SuicideWatch,feyjc6c,t3_eqr5t3,1579446240.0,Same lowkey. Don’t know when I’ll hit a big enough low to do it. But I know in my heart I’ll do it at some point. Its not just the depression. It’s not just how my life has gone up to this point. That’s all shit too. It’s about the fact that I genuinely don’t enjoy life or society. I’ve always been outcasted. Always been done wrong by anyone who’s ever came into my life. Only time I was ever liked was when I was on drugs and hitting licks on fucks. I’m not meant to live a good life. So when it comes time. That’s how I’ll go.
depression,feyh7a9,t3_eqs4h8,1579445508.0,This idea that we’ve had our whole lives that’s been instilled is that life will magically get better. And stay better. And that in itself helps drive depression. Because we get a few days where we feel okay. And the low hits. Something happens. And there ya go. Weeks of feeling like your life is just a waste.
