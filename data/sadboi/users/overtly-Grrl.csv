BorderlinePDisorder,fq6qipc,t3_gh41re,1589136472.0,I’m very glad that you mentioned the mood swings within an HOUR because that is the tell tale sign of Borderline. Bipolar mood swings are characterized over hours opposed to Borderline which is characterized as mood swings  **within** the hour. If this is your specific realization I would strongly emphasis this to your doctor because that was the sole identification to me getting treatment for Borderline. I would be screaming in one instance and go back to sad then happy within forty five minutes.
BorderlinePDisorder,fq6o496,t1_fq3cxwf,1589135274.0,"I definitely agree. Therapy has been the sole reason I’ve done so well without medication. I believe the discrepancy is how hard it becomes to manage yourself without treating the comorbid symptoms without medication. Yes, therapy is the best way to treat this; however, if you are doing therapy without the medication management it’s way harder. I definitely believe that OP should seek therapy, I’m just saying that I definitely feel that constant struggle to get medicated for the comorbid symptoms. I know OP doesn’t want therapy, which is why I still mention that it’s the best treatment, I just feel for OP on wishing they could be medically treated for the comorbid symptoms."
BorderlinePDisorder,fq2uqp7,t1_fq0n0cp,1589059938.0,"I very much agree with this comment. I hated therapy growing up. I’ve been in mandated therapy since the ripe age of nine due to being in foster care. I didn’t even get a POSSIBLE diagnosis until about a week ago, for BPD, and I’m 21 now. 

My psychiatrist had said the same exact thing to me, that therapy is the main source of treatment for this; however, I feel for OP when they say that medication could be the turning stone for them. I haven’t even started medication treatment for BPD yet, but I’m already seeing so many correlations to the book definition and I’ve been in therapy for more than a decade. 

In my opinion, I believe there’s got to be a good balance of medication **with** therapy. Medication won’t solve all of our issues because this disorder is a distortion of our fundamental thinking. Medication can’t change how we think/respond(not totally). I suggest doing both, OP. If I find anything that works for me I’ll be sure to refer e this thread again, but please take therapy into consideration, it’s the basis of this diagnosis. Best of luck❤️"

Through that time, I’m now 21, I had many fights with them and caused them immense pain. The suffering and neglect was shown in my presence at my new home. After about a year, like your daughter, I came to realize that this **was** my family and that they would refuse to abandon me. 

They spent the years before my adoption understanding the interworkings of my life with my bios. They never judged or made me feel bad about where I came from. If anything, they were upset for me, and showed it. They wished they had me from birth and acclimated me as such. No one knew the turmoil I had been through before.

ADHD,fka1a77,t3_f5r0lr,1583989106.0,"The biggest thing to do is make it a point to show your doctor you are educated in the subjects of your illnesses and the side effects of your medication. You have to explain, point blank, that this is not working and that you are not happy. Provide your argument via informational sources that back up your point. If your doctor sees that you’re not playing games with your mental health and you Know Your Body better than Anyone, they should get it. 

Truly, I had to have this conversation with my psych while off my adderall, and it was a shit show. She still thought she knew better than what I, myself, was experiencing. So after she neglected to up my SSRI and offed my adderall, I called her a week after. I viciously snapped into the phone about her not listening to me that my depression would cause suicidal ideation if she stopped my adderall cold turkey, and that’s what was happening atm. I told her that she should’ve upped my dose and rather than giving me hope after our appointment, she made me feel like I made a mistake trying to get help. The next appointment she had completely changed tune and said that she understood that I do quite a bit of research on my diagnosis and their counterparts. She also said she should have listened and that she wanted to try and listen a little better. 

Sometimes you have to stand up for yourself. Everyone kept telling me I needed a new doctor and second opinions but after I held my ground, she understood that I didn’t want to play games. Maybe your doctor needs your reality check."

Like your friend, my friend always reassured me that she Gets It(ie that it’s ndb) and I continuously feel so bad. She’s so awesome for that and I just always make sure to let her know how much I appreciate her understanding and help. Also similar to you, my parents made me feel incoherent when talking about ADHD and it deterred me from ever asking for help, as well as realizing some people Don’t MInd Helping. It’s extremely important to surround yourself with more people you come to know that are erratically different from your parents. You are deserving of a little help as a treat, once in awhile.

We are so deeply passionate for our lovers that we forgot that other people make new connections all the time. The only problem is getting the courage to do it. It takes us so much time to form that connection that I believe we become subconsciously complacent with who we’ve connected too. Not only that, but I personally seem to feel as though the thought of connecting to others and wasting so much energy becomes not worth it. Why would I leave when there’s history here?

It covers a wide variety of topics Lesbians face in relationships and why BDSM plays a role in that.

If this is a book you’re interested in looking into, I suggest keeping an open mind. This book really preaches Lesbian Solidarity and acceptance to the fact that everyone performs sex differently. I love it because it’s also helped me view the world a little differently too. Ugh it’s amazing.

AskLesbians,fii4l9l,t3_f7vuff,1582417287.0,"I really think it depends on where you grew up and what the peoples around you experience is. 

I grew up, until I was nine, in South Rome GA in the projects. No one ever called me a slur. My moms drug dealer was a Huge Butch Dyke and it was rather normalized. When I moved to central NY, in the suburbs with my father, **everyone** had something to say about the local dyke. There wasn’t a moment that went by where I wasn’t chastised for my sexual orientation by other women. My high school friends and I even discuss it like “wtf” now. With that being said, it was enormously accepted in my Ny high school to be a gay male, even fetishized by straights for clout, but as soon as a lesbian came out it was GameOver. Now I live in Western NY and would BEG someone to say something about it at my liberal college. Its pretty accepted here considering Buffalo had the largest lesbian population around the 60’s-70’s. I really think it’s where and the people you’re around."
ADHD,ficbp92,t3_f7hozv,1582342607.0,"This is happening to me right now. I just went to see a psychiatrist to get prescribed for my ADHD and she **brought up my IQ** asking, “You didn’t seem to have any difficultly during your assessments?” When she left the room to grab paperwork I started bawling because I felt so hopeless. The easiest way I can describe it is:

When I went without glasses until I was 15 the way I recognized people was blurry blobs and the way that blob walked. I found out I have an astigmatism in both eyes and my vision was -4.50 in contacts. My eye doctor asked how my school didn’t notice for so long and it was the fact that I did so well in classes and compensated for my lack of visual intake.  I won’t say my IQ because I truly believe it has nothing to do with how smart someone presents themselves as a person or how they interact with life and their retrieval of information, but my current therapist(whom I just switched over to after a therapist of 10 years due to a move) said the same exact thing to me. My grades and testing don’t show that; however, I have still yet to receive the FULL ADHD examination. So I have only been diagnosed preliminary. It’s infuriating that some people don’t understand the full extent to which we make up for what we think is normal. Us pushing this hard is not **normal**, it’s criminal."
ADHD,ficare2,t1_fic75y6,1582341910.0,I just talked to the doctor and unfortunately they want me to go through a withdrawal process for two weeks before switching to Ritalin. I don’t know how I feel about it(more upset than happy) but I told her I just want to function properly.
AskLesbians,fi8i1kh,t3_f6z1mu,1582240811.0,"I recommend reading Coming To Power by Samois. It’s basically a collective of oral history explaining, in depth, the inter workings of BDSM. It goes from vanilla all the way to knife play. It has medical information on keeping yourself safe, as well as information about how women function in a wlw relationship. It covers a wide variety of topics Lesbians face in relationships and why BDSM plays a role in that. 

If this is a book you’re interested in looking into, I suggest keeping an open mind. This book really preaches Lesbian Solidarity and acceptance to the fact that everyone performs sex differently. I love it because it’s also helped me view the world a little differently too. Ugh it’s amazing.

Edit: I wanted to add that it’s a little expensive and if you wanted I would send you a pdf of the book or something. I believe the price is FULLY worth it though. To understand Lesbian history and the antics of queer women is empowering. It’s brutally beautiful."

AskLesbians,fi61zdg,t1_fi4aaf7,1582176428.0,"I do agree that involving sex in a 9 year olds life is a little absurd; however, in regard to your comment on sexuality with age, I find that to be quite untrue. I’ve known I was a Lesbian since I was about six years old and I had a crush on my best friend Amy. Of course I never knew that that’s what it was at the time, because you’re definitely right, kids are clueless to that, but I think my point is that kids still know who they’re attracted to regardless of if they know it’s sexuality or not. I remember coming out as a lesbian to my grandmother and I didnt even know that my grandmothers roommate was her wife(I was nine when I expressed this to her). I was so clueless to what sexuality was but I still knew that I was overtly fond of girls opposed to trying to chase boys on the play ground. It’s just like when you’re four and you and your friends pretend to be married or date or be a family, I just kept trying to do that with my female counterparts instead. The funny thing is, everyone thought exactly what you’ve said and brushed it off as I couldn’t have known anything but my grandmother saw it in me before I was even aware. It’s definitely possible that OPs daughter heard it at school and just thought “Yeah sure i’m that” but it’s also very possible that she’s completely articulate in the way that she feels and **knows** where her loyalties lie with romance. Solely because she had the chance to hear the word Lesbian opposed to when we were younger.

Edit: I also wanted to add that was why I expressed that OP may want to just have open conversations with her daughter about how the daughter feels and knows that."
AskLesbians,fi6197p,t3_f6df51,1582175811.0,"Thank you for your solidarity! Sometimes, as a child, the way your parent reacts to a life changing moment in our life makes a huge impact, and for sexuality that is especially true. I admire your bravery in being so candid with your knowledge on the topic and expressing an interest in how your daughter expresses herself! I can 100% say it will help in the long run. Nevertheless, in regards to your question, there’s definitely a few things you can do to help keep that bond strong. I wouldn’t say bringing her to a pride parade would be the *best* thing, just because there are an array of people who go. This does not exclude furries, bondage/fetish gear, nudity, drugs etc. Something that helped me before I went to pride when I turned 18 was having older lesbian representation. Seeing older lesbians out and about doing their own things really empowered me to love myself and who I was becoming. It also helped me realize that caring about the heteronormative opinions society suppresses us with was useless because I didn’t even like men. Their smelly opinions(at that age) didn’t matter. It helped me grow into myself. Not to mention, if she has questions, she’ll likely get her answers considering how open lesbians tend to be with up and coming queer youth. One more thing I would mention is simply having a conversations with her. Yes, sexuality is very uncomfortable(for some), but if you start to normalize the conversations now, she’ll be more likely to express other concerns in the future and feel able to talk to you about them incase she has wavering thought later or true concerns with Lesbianism. The most important part is what you’re already doing and that’s being open to accepting you don’t know certain things. Her identity will bring a multitude of things you’ve never even dreamed about but in the end, helping you understand will also help her feel more comfortable confiding in you. Being a Gender and Sexuality Studies major, I have a plethora of good reads on Lesbianism and the oppression/suppression we receive as a specific  group in our heteronormative society as well as how that effects our growth as queer women, if you’re interested. I send the best of luck and love to you and your daughter throughout this beautiful journey ❤️"

Most people are saying that it probably means you need to change your meds as well as discuss it will your doctor.

If I regard depression as this separate entity inside myself it’s 1. Easier to be lenient with myself if I can’t do anything and 2. It’s easier to fight against. By viewing the depression as an entity that is not actually me and just some parasite, I can sometimes rationally work through those shitty days  i. e. “No, I don’t really hate myself. That’s not me. I wouldn’t think that”. Obviously there is a lot more thought going into it than just a sentence or two but I hope you can gather what I mean from it. Glad you’re here with us❤️"
