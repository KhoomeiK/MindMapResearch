BPD,fq5qcoy,t1_fq5poqw,1589114490.0,"That’s what I mean by educate your self. With Bondage you are putting a lot of trust in to the other person. I mean there’s little things to think about. Fo instance, how do you signal you want to stop if you have a ball gag in your mouth and you are tied up??? A squeaky toy in your hand! I recall seeing a form online that someone had made, it had a ridiculously long list of things/situations that you could fill out and say yea or nay to. See if you can find one and do it with your partner?? As far as crossing boundaries you have to be comfortable setting them for yourself.  Of course start small/slow and explore. If it’s something you can both enjoy don’t let your partner make you move too fast. There’s lots of fun to be had in the learning. Also, maybe find out if your partner desires you to be “submissive”, again that’s a whole lot of trust and care they need to put in if they want that kind of relation ship with you. You might not be comfortable doing certain things. Talk about everything!!!! Hahah, you don’t want to find out 9 months from now your BF can only get off if he’s in a full gimp suit while you beat him with a frozen mackerel dressed as a golden girl with feathers up your butt  , as unlikely as that is, you get the idea."
BPD,fq5piht,t3_gh0czc,1589113766.0,"It’s all about communication and consent. As another poster said, find out specifically what your partner is. “In” to.  If you aren’t familiar there are plenty of primers on the web , just “google” “kinky sex 101” or similar. Educate yourself and discuss specifics so you both know what to expect. I mean if it’s the type of thing you are interested in 🤷‍♂️. You. Mentioned BDSM so, immediately things like spanking, breathe play/choking, slapping , tying up, spitting come to mind. You also mention your BF “gets off” on pushing boundaries ?? You need to find out exactly what he means by that and make sure you are comfortable. If you think you are vulnerable you may want to think twice."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fn2i0d7,t1_fn2frj0,1586589723.0,"🤷🏽‍♂️ this is the main issue at least as far as I see it here in Australia. Under our quarantine rules we are encouraged to stay home and people are allowed to be out for : purchasing essential’s, exercise, compassion/care, and work and education. 
There’s also rules about the numbers of people that can gather etc. 
that’s what we’ve been told. Obviously it would be a bit problematic to try to specify and define each of those categories into specific activities, so authorities are giving the power to exercise discretion. You can’t uniformly apply “discretion” under those circumstances. For example, a truck driver here was fined for washing his truck at a car wash that was still open. He was the only one there. Who doesn’t have the common sense to know that that person shouldn’t be fined. Why did the police even approach him he was By himself and acting according to all the rules we’ve been told by the government during this time of quarantine. Another example a mother was fined for having her daughter out for driving lesson. Why? As far as the rules that we’ve been told that would fall under education I think. Common sense. I don’t trust police, and I think they like having these powers and will abuse them. Also I’m deeply concerned that this sort of thing is going to become the new normal and I’m not keen on giving away my freedom After this pandemic ends. So, we should be holding authorities accountable now."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fn2flb7,t1_fn2fgyr,1586587275.0,Depends where you are. Restrictions are different everywhere. Cops here (Australia) are fining people illegally and often for doing things that are legal under quarantine/restriction.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fn1zqag,t1_fn1tjq4,1586574101.0,"Absolutely! I think if a cop stops someone in a situation like this, they should be fined for breaking quarantine themselves. The problem is, cops are loving all these expanded powers and get off on fining people. 😂 they have to make up for all that lost traffic fine revenue somehow. Also, they’ve been given powers to use thier discretion but unfortunately most police are narcissistic control freaks and don’t have more than two brain cells to rub together."
