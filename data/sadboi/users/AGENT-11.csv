It means a lot actually. Using the wrong pronoun for someone is insulting. You might as well use the wrong name for them too. It's about identity and showing respect. It shouldn't be too much to ask to show someone basic respect to a transgender person, especially something you do for everyone else already. Maybe people wouldn't be victims if people like you didn't victimize them all the time. You're the one making a big deal about pronouns. But you're right, trans people are not special. So treat them like everyone else.

The military isn't the place for people with psychotic symptoms, its a high stress and competitive job around people who aren't going to have sympathy for you when things get rough. While being discharged i met other people being kicked out for similar reasons. If you're not accustomed to high stress environments and being around people, it's a really bad idea. You have very little to no alone time to recharge and examine yourself, so breakdowns easily happen even to the most mentally stable people.

I get the distinct feeling of my opinions and thoughts being invalidated because im schizophrenic, thus what i think *must* be irrational. It's an everyday thing because i can tell the people im around respect me less because of this illness. Then you have people who act like mental illness isn't real, that im just lazy, and my fears are invalid. The absolute worst is when someone suggest that im dangerous. I will never forget the awful feeling of my family telling me i can only come home after the hospital if i prove to them im not going to hurt them. I still cry about that. Being treated like ive done something wrong because im mentally ill gets very tiresome and is very hurtful and i personally deal with it from mental health professionals, family, and friends. This illness is so misunderstood, and even people who believe in mental illness and are friendly about it are guilty of bias and discrimination. My entire family acts like im just a lazy loser. The mental health system treats me like a criminal. Psych wards are prisons. It's all just very disheartening to suffer this much and have virtually nobody understand.   


Schizophrenia is so often a punchline or narrative device to show how crazy someone is. It's a term that invokes thoughts of The Dark Knight, serial killers, school shooters.
