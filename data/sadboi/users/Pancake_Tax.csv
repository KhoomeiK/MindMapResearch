Being ""quarantined"", or separated, can be a cause of loniless, depression,  and lead to suicidal thoughts. I don't know your situation and I'm not going to pretend too. Truth is, it is you against yourself, a seemingly losing battle. There is a way! Suicide, by definition, is fatal. There is no coming back, and no getting better. You die. All that you ever were or were going to be is gone, erased from history. Talking to doctors, to family, to strangers, and can provide relief.  Medicine can be relief. 
You might think that these things will only makes things worse, and YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT. But they WILL NOT be fatal side effects like suicide is. The statistics are in your favor, people who seek help live, but those who commit suicide always die. You can be a light to change others. You can be the one to help those in the same situation your in. Every day your alive is another day you helped, people like me. People like you. And complete strangers.

Anti-depressants, therapy, psychology,  telling people around you.
 While all these option may have serious side effects they won't be fatal. Suicide is a choice that is final, and forever. Put if off until tomorrow, and then put off again, and again.
