selectivemutism,fows2u1,t3_ga010n,1588125943.0,"I was told by my therapist that selective mutism and social anxiety are connected, but she didn't tell me in exactly what way. I just looked up some scientific journals about the relationship between the two disorders and it seems that most of them find that having social anxiety doesn't always mean you are selectively mute and having selective mutism doesn't always mean you also have social anxiety. However, in general, people with selective mutism who also have social anxiety score higher on social anxiety tests than people who do not have selective mutism. Some psychologists consider selective mutism to be a subcategory of social phobia, but some believe them to be different conditions. There is no solid answer and people are still researching how the two conditions are connected."

You kept getting back up. I hope you take the time to realize how truly amazing that is. Not many people have the strength to do anything near what you are doing. You are working on bettering your life despite all the shit life has dragged you through. Most people would have given up and given in. You are an amazing person with a great story to tell. However, your story isn't finished yet. I know it's hard right now, but if anyone can power through, you can. Don't give up now. You'll be depriving the world of an amazing counselor.

It may feel like you’re betraying her trust, but this is what’s best for her health. She may be mad at you, or even not accepting of your help, but if she’s too far gone to help herself, you need to figure out a way to step in with professional help. Unfortunately, our mental health system makes that difficult to do, but I’d suggest asking a doctor or mental health expert on where to go."
mentalhealth,f3hmvkh,t3_dh2ytw,1570925893.0,"Firstly, you are not a horrible person. It’s not your fault that you can’t keep your word. You have mental health issues, and you’re struggling. No matter how it feels, there is no shame in that. Everyone needs help sometimes. Your family in friends would be much more sad knowing that you’re not getting help, and that you’re in danger compared to knowing that you’re struggling to keep your promises. They want what’s best for you, and won’t be disappointed with you for needing a little help. It’s what makes us human. I suggest going to visit a doctor ASAP. They can set you up with some medications and therapy. You don’t need to endure everything by yourself. If you need anyone to talk to, I would be happy to chat."
mentalhealth,f3hlx66,t3_dgxuwm,1570925531.0,"I too struggle with this. I have borderline personality disorder which my therapist tells me in the reason for those thoughts. It’s similar to bipolar disorder. Relationship problems are common in people with both issues. Try to remember that most people don’t think so deeply about relationships like that. You care for other people, or at least sometimes feel like you do, and that’s what should focus on. Sometimes you might feel like it’s useless or question if you really care at all, but try to remember that there are times that you do. Force yourself to use logic instead of having your actions being controlled by your emotions."
mentalhealth,f3hkz3v,t3_dgzqln,1570925149.0,"I was in a similar situation in high school. My mom was suicidal and her moods were erratic. I didn’t know how to talk to her, as I didn’t know what would set her off. It stressed me out loving like that, and eventually planned to go live with my dad. But she had told me she would commit suicide if I did that, so obviously I felt like I needed to stay. Looking back now, I would want myself and you to know that your mom is an adult. It’s her responsibility to care for herself. There’s only so much you can do, and whatever happens, it’s not your fault nor responsibility. I know it’s hard not to worry, and you probably want to help her. But don’t sacrifice your mental health for hers. You should be your own top priority."

mentalhealth,exge7bv,t3_csobwg,1566261792.0,"What many therapists will tell you, is to ride the wave of panic. It’s a difficult skill that requires practice, but is very helpful. Basically, you need to recognize when you’re having a panic attack, involve yourself in the situation and understand that you’re in no real danger, try some breathing exercises to calm yourself, and take control of the situation. Ride through the emotions, and try to use logic to get through it. It’s hard to do so when you’re panicking, but once you get the skill down, panic attacks won’t haunt you as much as they do now. Also, if your symptoms are severe and badly affecting your school life, you might talk to your doctor about medication you can take when having a panic attack. There are types of medicines meant to be taken at the time of a panic attack to calm you down faster."
mentalhealth,exgdcu6,t3_csozda,1566261178.0,"I’m like this too! I think deep down, many are. I don’t know if there’s a term for this, but I do know something about the appeal psychologically. When you cover your face, you feel more anonymous. This makes you feel safer, and less self conscious about your actions. People are more likely to do bad or bold things while wearing a mask as opposed to not wearing one. It’s akin to how you might say things to someone online, but wouldn’t say those same things face to face. That’s most likely why you feel more comfortable. Also if you have low self esteem, and you find your face unappealing, then wearing a mask may make you feel more comfortable and confident."
mentalhealth,exgcfwj,t3_cspqwg,1566260510.0,"Depression does not have to be caused by trauma or a sad event. You could have a great life, friends, and family, but still feel depressed. It is quite common for depression to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. For example, your brain may not be making enough serotonin leaving you to feel empty or even sad eventually. My advice would be to go talk to a doctor and get screened for depression. If you are diagnosed, they can give you some medications that boost the chemicals your brain isn’t making by itself. Hope this helps!"
mentalhealth,exgbxoj,t3_csnfvk,1566260139.0,"Hello. Thank you for sharing your story, and I’m sorry for all the pain you’ve been put through. In my opinion, no one should be able to justify being friends with someone who sexually abused you. Especially not your boyfriend. Your boyfriend should be angry and disgusted, not friendly towards that person. I think you should bring up this concern. An honest healthy relationship is best. If he still insists on being friends with your abuser, that doesn’t say much for his “kindness.” Personally, I would break up with him, but you are in charge of your life and you decide what your feelings tell you."

mentalhealth,ewu98sz,t3_cq3ton,1565770326.0,"I took lexapro from my freshman year of high school all the way to my freshman year of college. I know it sounds hopeless to learn that you may be on medication for the long-term or even life-long. But that’s not always the case. When medicine is paired with therapy, you may find that you don’t need the medication anymore once you e healed. If your problems are stemming from purely chemical issues in the brain, it’s more likely that you’ll be on medication for the long-term, though. In either case, yes antidepressants really work. Lexapro will not change your personality. You will most definitely still be you. Lexapro is a type of antidepressant called an SSRI. SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. What these medications do, is boost your serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is commonly known as the happiness chemical. Sometimes your brain does not make enough which leaves you unable to feel overall happiness. Lexapro fixes this deficiency in the brain, putting you back to a normal level of serotonin. When you have the correct level of serotonin, depression and anxiety symptoms are decreased. I personally took it for both depression and panic disorder. I went from having multiple panic attacks daily, to having a few a week, to a few a month. That was medication alone without therapy. If you have any specific questions about my experience on it, feel free to ask!"
mentalhealth,ewu8rni,t3_cq3wtb,1565769654.0,"Hi! Thank you for sharing your story. I have gone through something extremely similar. I don’t know if it’s the exact same, but I was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. It causes extreme mood swings, high emotions, disassociation, and a couple other symptoms. Maybe research it a little? Your situation sounds very similar to what I felt about myself a few years ago. Hope this helps a little. Feel free to talk to me, if you’d like!"
mentalhealth,ewu8l6t,t3_cq4umd,1565769395.0,"I know this isn’t probably what you’d like to hear, but if you’re thinking that you need help for mental health, then that is what you should do. I know giving up a dream is devastating, but is being a fighter pilot worth dying over? It might sound dramatic, but mental health can deteriorate fast. While it may be thoughts of suicide as well as self harm right now, that can quickly lead to more permanent actions. Before you let yourself get that bad, you should do all you can to help yourself. Depression itself is a slippery slope, now to mention bipolar disorder. I have borderline personality disorder which is considered to be very similar to bipolar, and know exactly what the symptoms you’re describing are like. I left my symptoms alone and forced myself to keep going and attended my first year of college last year. However, in late November my self harm got really bad, and someone at the dorms called the cops. I was escorted to the hospital afterwards and had to quit school. Your dreams and ambitions can wait. They will always be there for you to return to. But your life isn’t something that you can play around with. Once you’re gone, you’re gone forever. Don’t let yourself fall down that hole if you can help it. If you need any advice in who to go to for help, or just want to talk more, I’m always open."
mentalhealth,ewu82hp,t3_cq576c,1565768676.0,"I believe you both have valid points. It’s important to look at your past to understand what has gotten you to today. In that way, you can understand your current issues better. But your therapist is also correct that it’s extremely important to not get caught up in the past. The past cannot be changed and you will need a great deal of simple time to make amends with your past. Therapy is not meant to solve your past issues, but help you cope with the issues your past is causing you right now. You can’t change the past, and must learn how to deal with the situation you’ve been given. You can’t solve long past traumas. You can only learn what to do now that you are where you are."
mentalhealth,ewu7uaz,t3_cq5pt0,1565768363.0,"I may not have the best advice, but I hope this helps. I think you’re comparing yourself to others too much. Telling you not to do so is easy to say, but no doubt hard to do. I know when you’re deep in depression, compliments fly over your head. They’re hard to believe and feel like flattery. But I don’t know you, and would gain nothing from flattering you. I do a lot of art as well. I think everyone has their own things to choose tribute to the art world. How many people can say they are in your situation? How many people can say they have experienced your experiences and have felt your emotions? You are unique and amazing in your own way. I’m not trying to play light on your disorders and health troubles, but I do think they might have a silver lining. You have so much to add and express in a way that only you can. Do not underestimate the power of pain and hardship. They will make you a better person ultimately. Just from the little I’ve read about you, I’m already positive you have an amazing sorry to share. Please do not deprive the world of your specific talents and stories by ending your life. There are people out there who need you. Every person on this planet has an expanding effect on the world however small. You affect those in your life, and those people will affect others in a never ending chain. Your life has meaning. Don’t listen to those too afraid to understand you. People are afraid of the unknown, but that doesn’t mean you are worthless. There are people somewhere out there waiting to hear your story and be a part of your life. If you’d like to talk to me, please feel free."
mentalhealth,ewu7ato,t3_cq5w74,1565767615.0,"I understand this completely! I cut as a way to cope with the pain I felt. I felt like if I didn’t, then I’d do something much worse to myself. Like it was the only way to press on in life. I didn’t want people to know, but at the same time I yearned to have someone notice. I wanted people to understand the pain I was going through. Suicidal thoughts felt like physical headaches when they got intense enough. I felt like I was going crazy, and needed someone to know. Like as if someone did know, they could help me, or at the very least understand me. I don’t think it’s something to be ashamed about. Your brain is quite literally calling for help. If you’re really struggling, and have someone you can trust, then I think you should try to talk about what you’ve been going through. It most definitely feels like it, but you’re not alone. Even a stranger has empathy to spare. People care about you, and you matter. Feel free to talk to me, if you’d like."
mentalhealth,ewu6yb9,t3_cq5olu,1565767141.0,"I think you should definitely see a doctor to rule out any serious possibilities. Sure it could be your imagination or sleep deprivation, but the symptoms all together are worrisome. The best time to catch this would be now in the early stages. And if that doesn’t convince you, there is a possibility that you could be having brain issues as well. You’re young, so it’s not likely, but you could have a brain tumor or something that’s causing this strange behavior. I would strongly suggest talking to a medical professional. Better safe than sorry."
