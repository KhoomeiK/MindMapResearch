In her case, its narcissism + stimulants.  She drinks a 6 shot coffee first thing in the morning, plus who knows what else (pretty sure cocaine). She will steal any conversation to talk about herself and her accomplishments, and also speaks at 2x speed, ALWAYS. It's fun (in a sad way) to watch the reactions of people meeting her for the first time. It takes about 10 minutes before they can get a word in to introduce themselves. It's like merging onto a highway, from 0 - 80 MPH within the span of 2 seconds. Very difficult to do, always just incredible to watch people try and process what is going on with her."

They would give the client’s current mortgage details but the client is considering refinancing. They would present multiple mortgage options and you would need to calculate all them to figure out what is best. The ones I had trouble with would have ARMs as a few of the options, or also have answers like “none of these mortgages are a good choice”, “client should keep looking at other options”,  “do not refinance”. I found those to be frustrating and very unclear"

askwomenadvice,fhax0wq,t3_f1w6qv,1581429377.0,"The same thing happened to me recently. There was an instagrammer that I’ve been following for 5-6 years and she died in a very tragic accident. She was in her early twenties and one the most physically gorgeous people I had ever seen in my life. I had always lived vicariously though her, and would have done anything to live her life. Except until it was all taken from her.  It really fucked me up for quite a while and I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I was not expecting to have the reaction that I did. I felt like I knew her and it hit me really hard. I also felt so strange for having lusted after her lifestyle and then suddenly being so grateful I wasn’t her. It is hard to mourn something that you don’t feel like you have the right to mourn. I’m sorry for your loss. Life is so so short and it can be taken at any minute. The pain of loss makes every day that we have less a little sweeter, don’t let that feeling go to waste."

Even the seemingly best men become so incredibly selfish after the woman essentially becomes an indentured servant with the kids as her chains. I watched this happen to my brilliant mother, and I promised myself I would never let myself be in a position for it to happen to me.

This is so much better than the usual narrative that ""Other Girls"" are bad or not deserving of respect. Why? For what?? What do ""Other Girls"" do that is so disdainful and disgusting? Why are we so intent on distancing ourselves from them? By disregarding ""Other Girls"", we dehumanize them and write them off as being lesser-than, allowing ourselves to pretend we are better-than.  The ""Other Girls"" are  human and deserving of respect.  Why would we leverage disrespect in this way? Who are we attempting to appeal to? Are we trying to win the approval of other ""Not Like Other Girls""? NO. This behavior is an attempt to appeal to men. An attempt to win the approval of men. Why? So we can opt out of the harsh realities of being a female? Not possible. This type of thinking hurts women and girls. If we grew up seeing more comics like this one, perhaps we would hold more respectful views of the women and girls around us. We are all ""Other Girls"", and that is why we need to support and love each other."
