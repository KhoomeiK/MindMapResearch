Also, you can move your music from apple music to spotify by website called soundiiz. (I have used it for moving from yt to spotify, and it worked well for me)"

lgbt,evowe98,t3_ckj0cp,1564659947.0,"Try to tell them there's a reason why the representation exists and is important. People from minorities like/love to see themself in movies, shows, ect. I remember a kid being excited to see a representation of himself! It shows that lgbt people are same as others. It shows kids that have never heard from parents about us that we exist and are same as them. It can speed-up the process of them learning about their own indetity. (I heard and experienced myself that some of us didn't even knew that being trans/gay is possible) I would bring up those things in situation like yours."

But if you feel pressure from yourself (or whatever else) to come out, I would also recommend doing it in jokingly way.  Prepare yourself to explain to them what does being pan really means, what means to you, your feelings. Think what questions they may have. I hope it will be a fine coming out!"
