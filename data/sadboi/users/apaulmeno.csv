bipolar,f7v7utl,t3_dxl5xh,1574021403.0,"Unfortunately, for myself yes. I used to be be very articulate, and as I have gotten older my bi-polar has gotten more extreme with no treatment that enables myself to have what I used to consider a pretty normal social life. My wife and I fight because I know what I want to say, but sometimes the simplest thought takes me going around and around babbling until she tells me what I wanted to say. Sometimes I can not stand to be in my own skin and communicate a thought a fifth grader can easy communicate. Has anybody ever have this happen to them? You just want to crawl into a dark corner and cry. It sucks. I took such great pride in my verbal communication. I refuse to play the victim and continue to search for ways to improve areas such as my memory that my bi-polar has affected. People that do not have bipolar say they understand. I say hell no. I don't think half the doctors really understand the disease."

bipolar,f7oxcqh,t1_exzejpn,1573936723.0,"I have tried no meds non medical treatment what I am seeing is my bi-polar is exponentially getting worse as I get older. I want off my meds. The first time around things did not go well any suggestions?. I had not worked in a long time. This week I finished my first 40 hour week in forever. Far below what I used to earn, I will lose everything without this income. It was so difficult, not the material, but the coping. I do not drink or smoke weed or do any other non prescribed med. WOW maybe 10 hours of sleep and the anxiety creeping in. F### bi-polar."
insomnia,f7oviu1,t3_crlnsu,1573935372.0,Usually on maniac high I do not even feel the effects. I can pump myself full of sleeping meds and they ZERO affect. The night will will fly by as if it was only half an hour. BOOOM. sunrise start the cycle again.
bipolar,f7ouny7,t3_dwhuf4,1573934748.0,"I have been out of work for a long time. Can not hold down a job. It has been a struggle to find the right medicine and combination to even function and be productive at home. My poor wife has stuck by me all this time, while I don't know if I would have had the strength to do the same. Within the last year, I finally decided to file for disability, even though it goes against every principle I believe. I just keep telling myself, I'm  gonna get better why file, well 10 plus years later I and  keep telling myself that. I have tried and continue to try non medicated ways of dealing with my bipolar along with still searching for the right medication.  The disability case is on going, but keeping a positive outlook again , but now say I will be better. I just can't accept the fact that actually as I am getting older it seems to be getting worse exponentially. Well I am not throwing in the towel, this week I completed my first full 40 hour work week in forever. I am scared to death. It has been so difficult. 10 hours of sleep in 5 days. I could feel the switch start to flip and anxiety creep in. I do not know how I will do it.  What I am certain about is if I can not hold this job , I will lose everything that matters to me in my life."
Antiques,f7n8sis,t3_d0o9gs,1573889651.0,"They are complete set of informal dinnerware my Oma got from Hitler. Each piece has an engraved monogram of AH at the end of the piece. They all have the official watermark on the back and the  manufacture stamp. I have spoken with dozen of collectors who have seen similar sets, but none with the detail of this set. WMF made them. I own two complete sets. The knifes have the unique markings associated with Hitler's informal patterns. The antique dealers showed me a a partial set far less detailed sell for 9000. I just wanted to show them off. Since she has passed. I just want to get them appraised so I can properly insure them.  So if any knows an expert in this  area please get me some contact information. I would be greatful. The story behind these sets is she had an affair with him and it was his gift to her. Who would have ever figured. So please if you know of an expert help me out. Thanks."
