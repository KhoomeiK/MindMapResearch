FemdomCommunity,fqz59a4,t1_fqz47jo,1589760159.0,"Haha right.  My last girlfriend was a former coworker.  Far from a leather clad vampiress.  Cute/pretty outdoorsy blonde.  

I’m fortunate to work with a ton of women.  I work at an environmental lab, always hiring young, intelligent people.  And it’s at least 60% women.  And it gives me lots of opportunities to test the waters.  I have like 5 of them right now that bully me and boss me around all day.  Some know I’m into it, to some it’s just my persona and my sense of humor (I guess I’m a huge brat).  It’s always light and friendly though, and it’s very subtle.  Gotta stay professional.  But hey I enjoy it.

But anyways my last girlfriend was so naturally bossy and loved to pick on me.  Unfortunately she wasn’t into any kink though, so we had this weird dynamic where was she cruel to me for real and not so much in bed.  Needless to say it didn’t work out.  

And thanks for your input!"

But that’s how it’s gone, more or less, with the three women I’ve been with.  They were the only ones patient enough to be with me.  I’ve had a couple other very awkward attempts.

It took a lot of painful lessons and many therapy sessions for me to realize it’s ok to need to establish trust.

I’ve been left by every woman I’ve ever loved feeling very inadequate.  I’m not quite into the sissy stuff as much, more general femdom I guess, but I’ve always struggled with vanilla stuff.  

So I guess all I’m trying to say is I get it.  It sucks.  It sounds like you really love him.  But I also want to say your needs are important too.  I have some regrets from past relationships not shelving my desires a little more.  I worry that maybe I was selfish, and if I tried to balance things out a little more maybe things would have gone better.

But I was also always very up front about my fetishes.  I never wanted to get deep into something and be in the dilemma you are in now.  As a consequence I feel like I rushed into things and didn’t try to build more trust first.  I feel like if I had more trust and wasn’t afraid of being abandoned I would have more confidence to perform vanilla and switch.

But it sounds like you’ve established a lot of trust, and I think you should be honest about your needs.  Even if his feelings might get hurt.  Because you are suffering in silence.  I hope this helps.  And goodluck!"

I’ve heard some people had success at meetups or maybe fetlife or something, but I think ultimately that starts everything from a sexual basis.  There’s more to a relationship than kink dynamics.

X women I meet per year times the probability I’ll connect with them times the probability of mutual attraction times the probability we have stuff in common and then, the biggie, the probability we’ll be compatible sexually which is like 2%.  Not great odds.

But yeah, I would recommend a therapist.  I struggle with anxiety and depression pretty hard, and sex and relationships are at the core of it for me.  My therapist has a lot of expertise with sex because she also does couples therapy.  It’s helped me a lot to accept myself and try to be optimistic about dating.  We’re stuck being who we are.  We can’t change that.  So we have to find ways to deal with it.

And yeah I fall in love super hard and fast too.  I became highly suicidal after my last breakup, which was the catalyst for me to go to therapy a year ago.  I’m doing much better now.  But I still have my days.
