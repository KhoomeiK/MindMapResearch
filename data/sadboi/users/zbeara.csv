I find this to be an exceptionally annoying assumption because I don't like relationships for feeling less lonely. I like relationships because the satisfaction I get from having that intimacy is very fulfilling. It makes me feel stressed and uncomfortable to divide my love between multiple people, so I particularly enjoy committed relationships. That's just how I am. However, just because relationships are fulfilling, doesn't mean there aren't other fulfilling things in my life. I can be perfectly content while single and I don't want to feel like I'm *supposed* to be in a relationship."

Saltoon,fotaf51,t1_fosr7pb,1588048485.0,"Tbh it's not a hard set role, it's just something you'll notice certain people gravitate towards. Sometimes someone will be sitting back and getting a lot of kills but not pushing. Like, if you're playing and a round and you notice that there's a lot of turf inked and the enemy team is pushed far back on their side, but you haven't gotten a very good push on the objective, that means you've probably got a few teammates who prefer the team support. They'll also likely be using fast and/or longer range weapons. It's good to notice openings that they create so that you can take the lead and make the push. You'd be surprised how far you can take a push just by being bold and intimidating the enemy team while holding the objective. Especially with a good support team. Being a carrier is about being able to fill any role at any time. And being flexible with team dynamic shifts at any point during a round.

I can say from personal experience, getting low kills absolutely does NOT mean you did a bad job. In fact the only thing kills are good for is making sure that you can gain advantages and make openings. You could win a round without getting any kills if you were good enough at pushing the opposing team back with intimidating advances (however this is not recommended because good players will notice the lack of kills and capitalize on that). If your teams are getting a TON of kills while you're not getting a lot, it more than likely means you were just paired with a few players that have significantly higher powers than you and therefore were likely more experienced and had an easy time getting kills. I would still recommend getting kill counts up, but not for the sake of kills. Try to get as many *useful* kills as you can. If you see someone being aggressive, try to catch them off guard and get rid of them. Or if you have an advantage over someone, don't be afraid to take an easy kill.

The most important piece of advice I think I could give you (only because you remind me of myself in the way I used to compare myself a lot to my teammates) is don't compare your performance with your teammates or excessively good enemies except with the intent of seeing what they do in order to adopt their techniques to improve your own playing. Outside of developing your technique, you won't gain anything by worrying about how you're not measuring up.

It also helps that I've played around 1,300 hours. Some of this stuff you pick up just by getting used to the gameplay to the point that your brain can process everything that's happening (I have a friend in the top 500 and he says he has 3,000 hours including the original splatoon, which I actually never played)

And one last thing, I've played with lots of top 500 players (not quite there myself but I'm getting there), and there are *plenty* of rounds where they don't get the most kills. In fact, I have seen lots of rounds where they will get the LEAST amount of kills, and that's when I started watching what they do and realizing that kills are not in fact all that important. However, they can still get loads of kills when necessary. What is more important than anything is battle strategy and being able to fill any role when needed while maximizing the abilities of your main weapon."

Splatoon_2,fnsnck0,t1_fnsl1hy,1587225110.0,"Oh, oof. The S+ grind was literally my least favorite because it's just that; a grind. You just have to keep playing and developing your battle techniques as you go. Keep in mind that S+1 is not much different than S+9. The difference is that because of your higher power you will be put in rounds where you have to carry more often. But the plays you see in S+1 will be essentially the same as you see in S+9, so while you're grinding, use that time to figure out how to be one of the carriers. The best advice I can give is try to be observant. And watch what the good players are doing. (It can be easier to watch a good player on the enemy team if you're still learning because then you can still keep your head in the game) If you see someone wreaking havoc, try to note where they go, who they splat, and what they do if they get splat.

There's not a lot of advice to give, because this is where you'll learn to apply the basic skills you've already learned and actually start developing techniques and speed up your gameplay. If you just keep playing you'll see your rank go up."
Splatoon_2,fnshkym,t3_g3l6gb,1587221774.0,"It took me a LONG time to realize this, but patience is extremely important when you have a subpar team. Don't try to get pushes immediately. Even if you have to stall for half the match, make sure your team is the first one to push. And if the push dies down, don't let the other team push back. You control the map. This is a mind game, not a power game. Power will only take you so far. Also remember that especially in the lower levels, the better you do, the more likely you are to get paired with smurfers. So really just taking those losses and trying not to get thrown off in the next match is super important if you want to rank up. You'll need to focus on consistency in your playing so choose random aspects you could work on each round such as aiming, speeding up your actions, battle plans, etc. Develop your skills. One huge thing that helped me was occasionally just sitting back and waiting for an opening. Watch what everyone else is doing. You'll start to see people's mistakes.

These are just a few things off the top of my head. I usually play in high level X rank games... not quite top 500 but I've gotten close. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask

Edit: Oh! And since you were asking about controlling your fate in Tower Control I will let you know that there *are* in fact specific sorts of ""dynamics"" for each mode that can help to understand. First, remember that for each mode, the objective is top priority.

In Tower Control you want to make sure you keep the other team away from the tower. Try to keep a sort of ""barrier"" around the tower. Make it so the opposing team feels afraid to access the tower and be diligent about keeping people off of it. Don't think of the tower as a just the thing that needs to get from point A to point B. It's an ever-moving battle ground. You can even use the tower to your advantage. Everyone's playing around it so once in a while climb up the tower and shoot at people to push them back and then jump off (a very common intimidation technique, and sometimes you'll get a splat in too).

In Rainmaker, it's all about pushing. Push, push, push. Don't let the team have openings. Literally all I can say about this is create a wall. Once the rainmaker is taken, whoever has it will be doing everything in their power to make a push. Backline weapons (chargers, splatlings, splattershot pros, jet squelchers, etc) are great for this mode if you want to carry (unless you can work in high energy, intensely focused situations because front-lining requires you to push). If you use a backline weapon you can keep the other team at bay and get easy rainmaker kills, and preventing pushes is half the battle. Also, I don't really use them, but tenta brellas are great for pushes. Anytime you're in a pinch or trying to get through a tight space, just let the brella go and shoot from behind it.

In Clam Blitz, it's honestly about observance. You want to make sure you're always controlling what other people are doing. Clam Blitz is hard because it is by far the most team based of the modes. So in that one you have to practice being the ultimate team player. Use ""this way"" wisely and your team will hopefully listen to you. I'm not sure if people are paying as much attention in lower levels, but still communicate. Be aware of the entry points for throwing in super clams and pay attention to the amount of clams your teammates have. If you have a noticeably high amount, try to clear an opening. If you see someone with 8 or 9 clams **and they are close to the basket** give them the remaining clams and make a push. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to wait until you have an opening to give them the rest of the clams, because otherwise you're just exposing them and likely losing that super clam to a splat. And when it comes to defense, just make sure you are paying attention to the entry points to your basket and keeping the enemy team away from them. Especially target people who are alone trying to collect clams. They could wind up being the one to make the push.

And finally, for Splat Zones. This one is all about patience and consistency. Once you have the advantage, it's a constant battle to keep the other team from pushing and trying to work them back farther into their side. You have to be aware of all entry points and intimidate the opposing team into staying back. Imo, it's the most straightforward mode. Keep a strong barrier when you have the advantage and make strong pushes when they have the center. *However* there is one extremely important point a lot of people miss; Always. Ink. The. Center. It is much easier to keep an advantage once you have it, so even if you don't have a lot of people around, trying to get the turf on your side is absolutely essential unless you're literally the only person alive and need to just prevent the other team from pushing further into your side.

A few more final notes. As always, pay attention to your team, look at your map to get an idea of the battle field, *especially* as you're spawning after getting splat, and if you see an easy splat, take it. Every splat is useful but don't focus solely on splats. Just make sure you *are* getting them. The most important splats are the ones that prevent people from ruining your walls, pushes, and plans. If you see someone sneaking off to the side, *that's* the person to splat. If you see someone standing back and getting a lot of splats, sneak around and splat them because they're the one preventing a push. Look for the person causing the most trouble and get rid of them while getting any easy splats to thin out their defense. 

And with that I conclude my unexpectedly long presentation on Splatoon 2 battle techniques."
