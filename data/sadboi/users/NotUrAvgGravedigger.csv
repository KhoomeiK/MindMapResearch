Perhaps your ""delusions, episodes, disorganized thoughts, grandiose thoughts"" stemmed from your emotions. And now that you're not feeling so emotional, for example, you're not rushing the neurons that create your thought processes, keeping you from having disorganized thoughts."
schizophrenia,fejlsks,t3_ephilm,1579179217.0,Yes.
schizophrenia,fejlpqt,t1_fej8owr,1579179142.0,"Meaning.

For example, the title ""I'm not a schizophrenic, I just wanted to tell all of you that we hear you and support you"" is not reasonable. Op wanted to tell me(apparently) that everyone hears and supports me. 1, that is not true, everyone doesn't hear and support me, with that first statement it had already started to sound like mushy words meant to make me feel hope and OP look like a support group(which they probably aren't). 2, ""we"" statements don't often mean anything, because one person often doesn't actually speak for the group. 

Another example, ""just"". ""Just wanted to say"" statements sound humble and nice, which is why so many people hoping to gain emotional leverage/wanting to virtue signal, use it. Because of that those kind of statements don't sound so humble or nice any more. Companies use them all the time, ""we just wanted to say, we care"". Who's we?

 Some people only care about niceties, so the logic part doesn't matter to them, some people(fewer in this thread) like me care a little more about logic in these allegedly humble statements. You just wanted to say it? then why didn't you just say it? Who hears and supports me? How? Why are you saying people you have no control over [or knowledge of] are doing something i would like? What does support mean in this context? Hear me, why does that matter? 

It probably doesn't sound as nice, but if the post only said sorry, more people might have ignored it, but it would have had the same meaning or maybe even more when you realize OP doesn't say sorry anywhere in their text. Not that it matters, sorry doesn't do much unless you really want to hear it. After reading the title, i got a bit suspicious and read the body message as carefully as i could.

You don't understand what my schizophrenia is like, we need more awareness. Why, i'm not saying awareness is bad, but why, what reason are you giving for this statement? It sounds like pandering, by this time in internet land, we should have all heard ""need more awareness"" panders by now, and by that i literally mean everyone should have heard it. Emotions don't repeat themselves like that, there are many other ways to express sorrow than buzzwords. 

This sub has opened my eyes in a way i didn't thought it could, other than the grammatical error, this was the most honest(according to me) phrase in this message. I've seen many people say it before, but it could be completely honest, and the possibility is not something to take lightly. 

""I send everyone a big internet hug"". Well, i wasn't sure what this statement meant or why it mattered, i've seen this many times as well, but i'm still not sure if it actually has any meaning. 

""I'm so sorry, this sub has opened my eyes in a way i didn't think it could."" There are no logical errors or meaningless statements in this one, so i don't feel quite the pinch of disgust(me personally). Most online praise is virtue signalling, i usually judge the context of the text by the reasoning behind it. Or if there's any reasoning to begin with."
