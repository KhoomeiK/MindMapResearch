mentalillness,fnpmatb,t3_g379p6,1587148004.0,"The best advice I could give to you on this is to CAREFULLY choose what you decide to accept as advice on this question because it's a reasonable question as I've asked myself this one a million times before but in the past year or so I have learned first hand that any mental health concern shouldn't be overlooked and we shouldn't try to come up with our own conclusions because sometimes it could make you feel worse if you're just getting advice and answers from people based on their personal experience but we all are our own person. 

With that being said, remember that whatever it may be that you're struggling with can be remedied . Whether you come to find (with a proper assessment session if possible) that you may be dealing with some mental health concerns or that you may not be "" mentally ill"" (hate that term btw, so negative sounding) but there still may be an underlying cause as to why you tend to result in the same patterned behaviour....there are solutions and ways for you to improve on this part of your life. 

I went years undiagnosed with what I've been ""diagnosed"" with and if I'm completely transparent here, a lot of coping skills that are taught within mental health concerns also work for day to day behaviours so maybe you could look up ""coping skills for...."" and research into what you can pinpoint are triggers for you to which cause these negative behaviours to come out and google a coping skill for that. 

Don't be too hard on yourself,  be aware but mindful of advice you seek for and we all have the ability to be shitty towards others at certain points in life but that doesn't necessarily mean you're  shit person, who the heck is the one to decide our own life manual and how to control it lol 

Hope you get some answers to help you and ease your mind"
AskWomen,fnpj8ze,t3_g34y3g,1587146457.0,"Even if this may seem redundant, after years of trying different coping skills the one major one that seems to have a higher success rate (with myself at least) is the in-the-moment pause what you're doing, close your eyes and breathe in and out deeply 4 times (if you have to walk away somewhere to feel more comfortable then do so without saying why because it's no ones business but your own I believe) and don't think of anything if possible within those 4 in and outs. Then, I like to bring my attention to this thought process: 

1. I acknowledge the FACT that I am facing a situation or thought that has angered me and doesn't make me feel good 
2. With that acknowledgment is your understanding that thoughts and emotions come and go as they are meant to and they are intangible so we can shape them more then we may think 
3. Then depending on the situation or the people involved, i usually temporarily part ways with the situation that angered me and tell someone that in this moment I've relaxed and don't want to become upset again (this doesn't have to be a selfish thing either, I often don't want my anger spewed onto people I care about) and that you'll process what angered you when you're relaxed enough to do so, and I tag along ""I hope you can understand"" because sometimes other people who may not know what it's like to deal with anger issues may have a hard time empathizing with what someone may be feeling so that little remark is a reminder to them that this is important to you but also a reminder to yourself that you don't owe anyone you're emotions (negative or positive) they are your own and you should be comfortable with owning that. 

There's a lot of little in between stuff I work on daily because my issues are up there, lol, but this whole in the moment anger process takes me about 5 minutes which is reasonable and doesn't feel awkward and the only time decisions should be made are when you're at a relaxed enough state mentally as in that state, I've noticed my subconscious doesn't takeover my conscious mind so habitual thoughts and actions aren't being naturally portrayed so it's more effective to come to solutions with what angered me. 

If any of this makes sense, I'm sorry if it doesn't. If you would like an further explanation let me know! 

Take care of yourself and remember it's okay to be selfish without coming off as selfish and thoughts and emotions come and go"
