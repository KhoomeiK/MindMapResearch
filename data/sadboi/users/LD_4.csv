You get REALLY weird looks and questions after that. Especially when they ask what kind of eating disorder because you feel insane saying you have a hard time doing something that’s so normal.
AskReddit,fquvrxt,t3_gkwoe8,1589665298.0,“Why did you go to rehab?”
EatingDisorders,fnwiu81,t3_fyau65,1587319200.0,"First, I’m sorry your wife is sick. That’s very hard and eating disorders are very confusing. Second, boundaries. My eating disorder looooooves to compare myself to my husband. And it HATES it when he tells me certain topics are off limits. He won’t entertain my conversations about my weight. He is very supportive so he will always listen if I am sincerely having a hard time or need to vent. But he won’t comment on my weight. He also shuts down conversations about starting new diet trends and tells me when I’m becoming too obsessive. He won’t talk to me about fitness if he feels like I’m taking it too far. And I don’t mean he won’t talk to me if he feels like I’m endangering myself. He just won’t keep the conversation of “yeah let’s workout more” or “oh that workout sounds fun what else are you wanting to do?” Etc. He also doesn’t tell me if other people comment on my weight. He also reminds me that he can do things that I can’t like skip meals, play around with calories, etc. because he does not have an eating disorder. He tells me that it’s not fair but it’s just how it is. Different bodies different paths.

All that to say, I don’t think you should give up cycling or exercising how you want. It sounds to me like your wife needs more help. If it’s affecting her life (having arguments with you) then it’s time to really do something about it. I have been in inpatient, in residential, in intensive outpatient, and outpatient programs. And in my experience, most of not all of us don’t feel like there is a problem. But once I got help I realized how sick I was. It’s not going to be easy for either of you. But telling her how important it is to you for her to get more help even though she feels she doesn’t need it could help. In my experience with eating disorder treatment, professionals will place you where you need to be in terms of level of care. They aren’t going to put you in inpatient if they don’t feel like you need it. So tell her to let the professionals decide how much help she needs. Chances are, she won’t realize how sick she is until she is well into recovery. 

I feel like this was all over the place but I hope it was at least a little helpful. Feel free to pm me!"
EatingDisorders,fnwf6b5,t3_g2c2gp,1587317219.0,"I was inpatient for a few months and what was helpful was not talking about the staffs personal experiences with eating disorders. They had rules that they couldn’t share too much personal stuff with patients and I found that helpful. 

After that I was in intensive outpatient and I had a TERRIBLE dietician. We had to eat dinner together and she would constantly compare us to each other. I was upset about eating one night and she asked another patient why her eating disorder wasn’t as strong as mine. Then legitimately asked another patient if she felt bad because she wasn’t skinny. Absolutely insane and awful.

That was 10 years ago. I have a therapist now but for anxiety and ptsd. I do still struggle with the Ed but not nearly as bad and I can get myself out of a relapse. But the first time I told her about it and that I still struggled with it she told me she also struggled with one. It threw me off and made the Ed thoughts immediately compare mine to hers. Now I don’t feel comfortable at all discussing it with her. Which is ok because I’ve been in recovery for 10 years and, like I said, can get myself out of a relapse. And even the relapses I do have don’t last more than 3 weeks at a time. 

This might be personal preference that I don’t like knowing the personal struggles of my therapists. Others seem to do well with being able to relate. I just already have people and friends I can relate to. I want a professional to help me. So you could feel out a patient before you dive deep into relating vs listening and finding a route to take."
EatingDisorders,fnwdv40,t3_g2z78m,1587316500.0,You don’t need a diagnoses to get help. I promise you that you don’t want to slip into a full blown eating disorder. I would see if you can talk to someone virtually. You mentioned not being able to get a therapist? I’m not sure why but if you really can’t talk to someone then I suggest trying to find workbooks and other books (jenny Schaefer has some good ones) and trying to find a free support group? Right now I’m assuming groups are postponed. But look for EDA (eating disorders anonymous) or even celebrate recovery. These are not therapy groups and can sometimes be triggering. But any help is better than none. Feel free to message me if you want to talk!
EatingDisorders,fnwcraf,t3_g2z40o,1587315892.0,"Different bodies, different needs. You won’t gain weight based off him not eating breakfast. I feel the same and that was a huge trigger for me when I was really sick. But try to remember that humans need food. It’s not a weakness. It’s just a normal thing. His body can handle skipping breakfast, your body doesn’t care what he’s doing and feels sick when you skip. On the weekends, my husband fasts allllllll day long and then eats one meal for dinner. Because of my history with eating disorders I can’t afford to do that even if I want to. I would look up @megsy_recovery on YouTube. I don’t normally recommend those channels but she is very helpful. She talks about this a lot!"
EatingDisorders,fnwbmm8,t3_g47kus,1587315270.0,"There’s nothing you could have done. It’s obvious she felt loved by you and your brother and honestly, that was huge. I’m so sorry for your loss."
