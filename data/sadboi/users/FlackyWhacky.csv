I work retail as a cashier currently. Customers forget to grab there bags all the time. All i can do is bring it to the service desk a note it in the book that its there. Yesterday a customer came all the way back to the store for that one item and to come complain to my face about how i put “Too few items” in the bags. It’s awful. So, you woulda also complained if i put more that there was too much in the bags? It’s also the same when i run the liquor portion of the store, I don’t Care if you look 105 years old, I’m IDing you or get outta the liquor store! Some customers create the biggist fuss about things. And somtimes thats all it takes to send you into a spiral. Your not a bad person. Fact, you were probably being manipulated.
