As for cheaper brands on Colourpop's price level, I like Catrice. They aren't as bold with the colour choices but they're good quality at a low price. Their blush boxes are the stand out product for me. Plus I can get them instore so I can actually swatch them.

unitedkingdom,fpatu7u,t1_fp95wh6,1588455582.0,"> The biggest issue I see with travellers is that education to 18 isn't mandatory for them, and in many cases is actively frowned upon in their culture.

I'm in Ireland and I personally know quite a few travellers, but I admit that they are outliers in that they've all completed second-level education. 

One of the reasons so few travellers don't finish education is the expectation placed on female travellers - gender roles in traveller communities is like the 50's on steroids - I know female travellers who regularly would miss a school day because they were expected to be at home doing housework or whatever needed to be done. It didn't matter if there were plenty of men to do it, those lads would never be seen doing 'women's work.'

And when it's normal not to have finished second level in your community, it doesn't seem like a big deal not to attain it yourself. School is also a lot harder for you when your parents can't help with homework;  they may have an untreated learning disability, or may never have learned to read because of their own lack of education.

A lot of travellers I know also have plenty of stories of mainstream school being a hostile experience."
