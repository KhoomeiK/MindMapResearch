bipolar,f6yabn5,t1_f6y9jp8,1573272575.0,"I saw him & manson live a few weeks ago (finally) been waiting for years to get the chance after listening to them for over a decade.

Let me tell you why I think Rob Zombie is an incredible depression-flipper soundtrack for us:

It's uplifting, energizing, and moody. It also makes no goddamn sense. I recommend getting hyped up off of ""Well Everyones fucking in a UFO"" to start. its easily a catchy tune to sing along with, and if you really look into the lyrics (and music video) its just nerdy absurdism. The combination of hype energy with the realization of the absurdy brings me out of my rut most times.

Just thought id share my two cents. good luck :)"

Epstein,ezv8d37,t3_d2iq1i,1568169917.0,"TL;DR:

Some kind of Piano/Study Room  


* The floors appeared to be made of wood and were covered with a large Oriental rug.
* The interior had two levels, with the first four to six feet at ground level and the rest on a slightly raised platform accessed by a single step.
* To the right, against the eastern wall, was a nondescript gray couch or sofa.
* Directly ahead was a desk, about 10 feet long, made of dark wood.
* Behind the desk were several columns of floor-to-ceiling bookcases.
* The bookcases went high enough to require a ladder. But there was no ladder.
* The bookcases were filled with hardcover bestsellers. (Baron said he didn't notice ""anything scholarly."")
* To the left, against the western wall, was a small black grand piano. According to Baron's notes, it was manufactured by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company, whose piano-manufacturing operations were acquired by Baldwin Piano Company in 1988.
* Above the piano hung a portrait of Epstein and the pope. (Baron wasn't certain which specific pope, but when I showed him photos of the most recent three, he said his best guess was John Paul II.)
* The interior consisted of only one large room; there weren't any doors or stairwells that may have led to other rooms."

Satyrias is  hypersexuallity in males (where as females used to be considered nyphomaniacs). It used to be considered a medical term but neither is no longer considered as such. Basically a pathological sex addict.

TBH the second article got me lost real fast

The MJ interview was interesting to hear the insight of a long time associate of JE, but quickly turned into Pivar doing mental gymnastics to try to paint JE's actions as sympathetic. Downplaying to say the least. He on multiple occasion noted that if JE did it ""One time to some 16 year old no one would notice, but he made an industry out of it."" Then went on to yadayada about how he couldnt help himself with his conduct due to his ""pathology""."
Epstein,ey8tbax,t3_cw7lf3,1566927839.0,Well that was an uncomfortable few minutes spent.
