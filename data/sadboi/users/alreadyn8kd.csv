Thank you"

relationship_advice,fcnno0z,t1_fcnej6i,1577814932.0,"I should have included more details for sure. We've known each other 16 years - we were childhood sweethearts for 6yrs. We just reconnected after 10yrs and went on this uber romantic trip to Paris, then spent time when he visited in Philly and spent time with his family. So there's a lot of history. I'm moving to Cali in summer. But we're not monogamous. I'm not sure where we go from here. Complicated."

BipolarReddit,faogros,t1_faoep3h,1576263992.0,Thank you! I'm so glad I found this thread it feels good to have other people to talk to about this. :-)
BipolarReddit,famvtkg,t3_e8ef5m,1576214366.0,"This has been really soothing to hear so many stories. I recently had my 2nd episode (I call manic me ""The Imp"" which is what my mother called me when I was naughty as a child). My best comparison is to equate this condition to being a werewolf. The Imp is wild, vicious when she wants to be, cunning and resourceful and finds everything hilarious even when it is far from funny. Every decision is the most brilliant idea anyone ever had. This episode really showed me how much my true friends care for me. I am so relieved I didn't do or say anything to hurt them. My granparents however, have stopped talking to me, which they also did after my 1st episode. They are visiting my aunt in the UK and my aunt wrote me a very long fb message today and the most hurtful line was ""I know what you said. You should be ashamed of yourself. You really should."" 
She was referring to things I said in the hospital to my grandmother while manic. Obviously I have no memory of what I said or why I said it. I don't want to know. But I so wish they understood I was sick and I am still learning. I don't know how to fix it."
