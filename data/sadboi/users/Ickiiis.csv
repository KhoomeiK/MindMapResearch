That’s not to say some can’t be, but the majority are not and usually you will be informed by your OB if there may be complications. I’ve had the boyfriend of the woman we are picking up sitting on the couch watching TV, and when we told him he should be driving her, he says “Nah, I’m kinda tired, babe just call me if you give birth.” This platypus looking, banana-throat-tickling, mother fucker had the audacity to say he was too tired after gloating about not working for a month. 
 

In case you’re curious, when we arrived he was trying to see how far back he could put the banana before he gagged. He said it tickled instead."

OurPresident,fo1z96o,t3_g4x4vo,1587445178.0,"This picture says a lot to me. Like the fact someone had the time to take a picture, rather than run over to flag the ambulance down. In an emergency if you have time to take your phone out to document something, you clearly have your priorities mixed. Stop to think these are humans working on an ambulance, many of which are currently under high stress and working extended hours for your safety. If you in fact had great concern over the well being of a fellow man down, you would have made the effort to run over to the ambulance to at the very least get their attention. Hell they may tell you they can’t stop because they have a patient on board, but they will radio it in to get someone there ASAP. This picture to me, highlights what the fuck is wrong with the general public. There is too much concern in documenting and not acting. Fuck your phone, get their attention. There is a very good chance they did not see this happening. There is more cause for concern to me in someone taking a picture of someone down rather than running to check if they are ok or in this matter getting the attention of ambulance personnel. They are allowed to be tired, they are allowed to be human. But it’ll please you to know this will more than likely reach their administrators office and an investigation will be done to see if they acted correctly or not. What troubles me is the alarming rate at what lengths people will go through to get another person in trouble. Because this can very well get these guys suspended or fired over what could have been a non issue had someone simply flagged the ambulance down. Yeah this bothers me because I’ve had it happen to me before. Sometimes we are merely focused on not getting hit or not hitting anyone while driving because accidents can easily cost us our job. I would have to say the chances of them (the crew) just saying “fuck it leave him on the floor” are slim to none, based on people like this existing with their phone always recording. But how would I know? I’m only a paramedic that works 48hr shifts at a time. At least in my opinion, if you had flagged my unit down we would have stopped. Not everything is corrupt political bullshit, this could have just been as easy as “damn didn’t see him there, thanks for stopping us.” But thanks for taking the time to take a picture during an emergency situation where seconds can in fact matter, while an ambulance is right in front of you. Yeah that’s what I see."

The assumption here is they wanted to take care of what they could at the urgent care, and determine whether this complaint warranted a trip to the ER. Believe it or not but a lot of people call the providers hotline in order to get advice over the phone. Chest pain with shortness of breath?

Ok a little background, I work as a paramedic in a town that can be said to embody trashy. the majority of the women I have transported out here that wear that hairstyle you have also present with the following: sweat pants or Jersey shorts, slide sandals and socks, immature and bitchy, 2-3 baby daddies, every other word is “fuck.” I’d add in more, but I think I made my point. Now it’s not to say you are trashy, because you may not be. But the style you have chosen screams it. 

I’d suggest getting a new hairstyle. One less likely to say juvenile, because that’s mostly where I’ve seen that kind of hair, in high school. 
Keep the nose ring if you like it.
If you’re going to head out anywhere, slide sandals and socks are never a good choice. 
Confidence because you are attractive. 
Personally I think those large earrings look terrible on anyone. They remind me of a chola about to get down telling her home girl “hold my earrings girl I’m about to fuck this bitch up.” 


As far as everything else goes, yes you are pretty. I’m a sucker for green eyes. You could try smiling more, showing teeth is always a plus. From the looks of your picture, your boobs are big, cleavage or no cleavage is entirely up to you. Depending on the person looking you’re either gonna be “showing off” or displaying confidence.

I’d walk by backpacks left unattended and snatch them up, run over to the bathroom, check them, and put them back.
