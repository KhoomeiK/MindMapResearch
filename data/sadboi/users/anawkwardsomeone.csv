TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fqsj7bt,t3_gklyez,1589608774.0,"I don’t think it’s something you can just “switch off”. And it’s probably not even your fault. It’s probably been subconsciously engrained in your braid from childhood (especially if you were born prior to the 2010s). 

I was also intimidated growing up by “pretty girls” because I wasn’t feminine like them. And up until college, I assumed that any woman who is beautiful/dresses up nice/has lots of makeup/etc is either stupid, shallow or mean. That’s not the case at all! 

How I changed my mindset was through movies, YT videos, podcasts.... Thankfully we’re living in a new age and concepts such as “the cool girl trope” are widely used now. When I was growing up I took it as a complement when guys would tell me “you’re not like other girls”. Now? If a guy tells me that, I’ll get up and LEAVE.

You have to slowing change your mindset and I guess “re educate” your brain into understanding that women are not a two-dimensional thing. We can be lots of things at the same time. And a woman who’s into nails doesn’t automatically mean that she can’t be into fast cars too (just an example).

I’m sure that we (as a society) will discover down the road even more little micro misogynistic things that we’re not aware we’re even doing right now.

You just have to slowly re wire your brain, IMO. Also, stand up when you witness other people being misogynistic. If you notice something even in your friends and family that’s not right, stand up and say it. Call them out. That will reenforce your beliefs in your brain.

That’s how I changed some of my bad misogynistic habits."

You’ll see coworkers openly slacking off and somehow they’re never getting a lecture about it, they’re never made to feel like they’re not doing a good job. But you, who’s actually trying and care, will get micromanaged, controlled, go unrecognized and made to feel like it’s not enough.

Do the bare minimum is EXACTLY right. Nothing more, nothing less. Clock in, clock out. That’s it. Don’t try, it’s not worth it."
