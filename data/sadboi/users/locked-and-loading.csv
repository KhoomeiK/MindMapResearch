With barely any lockers (which are useless in nightmare anyway) and having to search around the burning rooms and corridors to find your way out with barely any flamethrower fuel whilst also having the alien dropping every 5 seconds made me feel terrified, scared and desperate to finish the (what felt like) impossible game. I've watched plenty of speed runners do nightmare difficulty speedruns but I have never felt more fear and as much cold and sweaty hands as I have ever felt then in my life."
