aww,fomegml,t3_g7y7n5,1587887081.0,"Guess, I should have added some more details. So here you go, 
1) The black dog (Karma)  was rescued December 2018 from the roads in India. At her time of rescue, she had a fractured tail(twisted by a monkey), broken but self healed front right leg, no mother's milk, parvo and tick fever. Her foster mum did the best she could and Karma survived. When I adopted her she was 4 months old, didn't know how to chew, ate all the dirt and sand around her, wasn't able to digest cooked eggs or chicken. She is now 1.5 years old, 10+kgs and healthy as fuck. She eats two big meals a day which includes, veggies,lentils, turmeric, rice,chicken liver and gravy. She gets dewormed every month, walks twice a day, plays in the evening and goes to the beach every Sunday. The reason she looks skinny is beacuse of lack of nutrition in her puppy stage. The vet said, she is a medium size Indian mongrel who can gain bone weight and stamina but no flesh weight. Hence Karma looks the way she does.
2) The pup is 40 days old. I am fostering her since past 4 days. Her mum got run over by a vehicle and she was rescued, put in boarding since just 10 days old. She also doesn't have mom's milk and is yet to be vaccinated. When she came to me ,she was even skinnier, but dewormed. I'll continue to deworm her every 10 days, make sure she gets all the shots. I've been feeding her 4 times a day with puppy starter, mother's milk supplements, mashed rice, potatoes and carrots, turmeric, bread and scrambled eggs. I'm slowly increasing her meal sizes to make her gain weight. But it's gonna take time, I would say atleast a month before all her bones stop showing. Then, I'll try to find her a forever home.

So,  I think I am feeding them correctly and also following the vet's instructions. Also, maybe the pup looks even more skinnier coz her fur pattern has black vertical stripes. Hope this clears some concerns."
