OP can take it or leave it, and so can you. No need to be offended.

OP, if you are reading this, I am not trying to be harsh. There are parts of the job that bring joy, too, but it is up to you to decide if they outweigh the negatives. Talk to as many vets as you can, see what they say. I just know many a veterinarian who swears up and down they wouldn't do it again, but that message is never conveyed to pre-vet students. And I encourage you to make your own decisions, like anyone. I just consider it a disservice not to make you aware of the other side of things. Not just the ""follow your dreams and everything will be okay"" aspect. You asked if school is hard, if you bring work home a lot. Here is a reply from another vet in a different thread about this career path:

""Veterinarian. 

Insanely competitive schooling that crippled you with debt, with a depressing debt:income ratio after graduation. 

Most of your patients don’t like you, and most of the owners think you’re getting rich upselling them unnecessary services when their dogs’s exploding eyeball cancer can be cured with raw organic exotic meats/cbd/coconut oil, but you’re withholding that information because you’re in bed with Big Kibble.

Veterinary,fd7iqri,t3_ek57jb,1578205187.0,"I only offer this advice because you are still in high school and not invested in the pre-vet path, and you can take it or leave it: dont go to vet school. I am a recent grad of vet school, and I regret my decision to go, and honestly, my determination to go (something I wanted since I was 4 yrs old). You can find other jobs that give you more satisfaction, pay you better, and don't tear you down like vet med can.  There are other ways to work with animals, as your job or outside of work. Just my two cents."
AskReddit,fcwogw2,t1_fcwobba,1578031621.0,"Agreed. Everyone works hard in a vet hospital, and everyone has their role to play. Everyone should be appreciated for the role they have.

Edit: Idk about egos, I struggle with imposters syndrome, but people should just be kind and stay humble, and everyone should work toward what's best for the patient.

Edit 2: I've never worked in a hospital setting where techs decided dosages of meds...this really should fall on the vet IMO.

Edit 3: I do have to point out that vet med is not just a handful of the most common diagnoses you see in GP, and believing it is probably lends itself to a false sense of confidence in regard to what you know vs what you think you know."

Everyone in a vet hospital has a lot of work to do. Vets are taught that they should be focusing on performing the work that their vet techs cant do. A tech and draw blood, a tech can give fluids.

That's all it took, nothing strict. But at the end of the day, every diet and lifestyle in existence comes down to calories in/calories out, my friend. It's science. Not pseudoscience or opinion or anectdote. It's just the facts.

If you were as big as you imply, do you think maybe you were eating more calories a day then than you are now? Because that would explain weight loss, even if you eat 2000 now. As you continue to lose, eventually, eating that many calories won't get you the same results...

My ex did the same thing to me, except he didn't even ask me- I just looked up to see the phone in front of me, and I was too passive to make anything of it in the moment. Fast-forward five years, and he continued to push and completely ignore boundaries, but I slowly got more angry every time and eventually asserted myself when these things happened. Even though I had watched him delete the video, he had it somewhere else. He continued to take pictures here and there without asking. Despite clear communication and even arguments, I left that relationship having been raped multiple times, and him never having accepted responsibility for it.

I am not saying this will escalate with your SO like it did for me, but I am saying that people who don't respect boundaries don't learn to do so with hand-holding. Instead, they find every excuse to make it ok, and IMO only some real wake-up call type shit, such as ending things, will make them see what they did was wrong. But, even then,  it may never change them.

Just be careful, please. Your privacy is a precious thing and only you should have control over who is invited in.

Hopefully that is not the case for tiny turtle, but I would be surprised (pleasantly) if he ended up prospering and living his normal life expectancy. That being said, sometimes the other defects are more trivial than having your legs face the opposite way"

It may take you a few therapists before you find one you click with, but don't get discouraged. The effort you put in to find the right fit, which you will be able to recognize, will seem worth it when they know way more about you and your experience than you ever thought you would share and you don't decide you want to go start that over with a new therapist for one reason or another."
