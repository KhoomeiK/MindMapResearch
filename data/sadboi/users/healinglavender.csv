wowthanksimcured,fib2lbt,t3_ezrly3,1582313332.0,"something I get a lot when I say I have CPTSD is ""no you don't."" like... okay??????? I don't even know??? what to say to that??????????? you can really tell someone's had a perfect life when they are physically incapable of compassion ugh"
CPTSD,fi6fi7g,t3_f6q6ab,1582192370.0,"ack, I feel this so much. I can't understand why or how to fix it and it really bothers me."
CPTSD,fhdxs4v,t3_f2omzs,1581506843.0,"it's the worst. since im still in high school we have a bunch of class discussions where we talk about family (ouch) so I feel you 
also, whenever I bring up that studying is really hard for me, or when a teacher notices I'm not doing well in their subject, I often get ""why don't you ask your parents for help?"" and they just can't process the fact that that's literally the worst thing I could do. it sucks. a lot of people are really bad with compassion I guess"
CPTSD,fgja3z3,t1_fgj5804,1580839994.0,"I know how hard being vulnerable is. So far, I've only really opened up to people online, where I have the safety net of just being able to disappear if something bad happens.
I also still live with my abusers. I can't legally or physically do anything about it yet, but I can imagine how feeling like you could get out and not being able to must feel. But living with someone who doesn't treat you as human is so rough, you cannot blame yourself for not being able to change your life drastically (moving out is really Something after all). Humans can only thrive on love, help, and support, and trust me, when (and not if, when,) you find people that are willing to give you that without expecting anything in return, things are gonna get much easier. It's still gonna be very hard, I won't lie there. But what I'm saying is, when you lack something that is essential to every human's wellbeing, you can't expect yourself to be at your best. I know it's gonna take a long time to learn to be gentle and kind to yourself, but starting today will get you to that goal sooner. You don't have to love yourself immediately, but start with neutral. Things like ""my body carries me from one location to another, therefore it's useful.""
I also have nobody in my biological family that's safe to open up to, much less live with. It's really hard to survive without those connections that just seem to have been handed out for free to everyone else. I don't have much else to add here, I just hope knowing there's someone else that understands how much it sucks helps.
I also have problems with trust but on the opposite end, I trust way too easily, and it has hurt me quite a bit. I've met dozens of cruel people, whose only purpose seemed to be to hurt others, with an ego bigger than any object in the universe, with morals and ideals so distorted I can't even begin to comprehend them. I know a lot of the ways humans can hurt others, aggressively or through inaction, directly or subtly, keeping it secret or showing it to the world that doesn't seem to care- or that even enjoys my pain. And it's horrible, terrible, terrifying and disgusting, and for a while I thought it was all hopeless, but for all the bad there is in the world, there's just as much good, if not more. I've met people so wonderfully kind, so eager to help others, that after over a decade of being mistreated by so many people the way I was, it simply did not seem real. How could anyone willing to listen to my problems exist, with such a patience that even after I complained almost daily for a month they'd still be there for me? How did people so ready to remind me they support me stick around despite all my flaws? And the jokes that don't rely on making someone feel bad, and the little gestures, like checking up on me when I've been quiet, making sure I'm not isolating myself, or even just asking me how I'm feeling occasionally and actually being interested in the answer, and the genuine compliments, and listening when I talk about my interests, it was all so wild to me, completely undiscovered, never seen before, but it was so real, and it still is. And that's just on a personal level! I can't help but think about all the people that dedicate their entire lives to helping people they've never even met before, or those who do what they can to help others, ready to give some money to those who need it when they don't have much either, or even just treating others with kindness and patience when it's just been a horrible day for them.
So, I don't know, I guess to me the risk of meeting those who truly suck is worth the reward of when I meet wonderful people. And, again, I've been really lucky, I could still be searching. And I know how alienating it feels to be sorrounded by shitty people. But good people really are out there.
Sorry if this is a bit incoherent."
CPTSD,fgj3hwz,t3_eyml3q,1580836282.0,"I promise you there's still some you left. Your trauma didn't take every part of you away. Through recovery and healing you'll find a purpose. You just have to give yourself time. 
If it helps, I'll share my reason to live; other people. Humans were designed to love and it's so wonderful. I could never exist without it. Connection with others is what gives me a purpose. And I'm a massive introvert! But no matter how often my brain tries to convince me I burden the people around me, no matter how hard it tries to guilt me into self sabotaging my friendships, the time I get to spend with those I truly love convinces me to stay. And I recognize that I've been extremely lucky to find people I click with so easily, but I promise you there's at least one person out there that will truly love you, even the parts of you you feel are 'broken.' (It doesn't have to be romantic love.) The hardest part is finding them. You really have to put yourself out there, be open, ready to welcome people into your life. What I've found has helped me is picking up hobbies that require teamwork- in my case what lead me to some of the best friends I've ever had was Dungeons & Dragons, oddly enough.

I recognize this might not be helpful at all, so if that's the case feel free to just ignore this, but I thought I'd try."
CPTSD,ffw5jb7,t3_evj3mc,1580285308.0,It's truly the worst.
CPTSD,feq5b90,t3_eqdeyx,1579337822.0,"I promise setting boundaries won't make people feel uneasy around you. Abusers tend to 'teach' you that setting boundaries makes you selfish and that people won't make the effort to respect them, but it's not true. They only tell you this so they can control you, so rebel by standing up for yourself and treating yourself like a human.

Unfortunately the only real way to let your friends know that what they talk about is triggering you is... to let them know. It's terrifying, I know. And I can't promise you that they'll be decent human beings and respect your boundaries either, so it's even scarier. But you deserve people that respect you.

I suggest perhaps 'testing' how they react to you setting boundaries by asking them not to talk about or do something super easy to avoid. I don't know what that would be, since I don't know how they act, but maybe ask not to mention a somewhat common but not essential item (like maybe paper clips, or gloves [those might be essential depending on where you live though]). They might slip up a few times initially maybe, but as long as they are genuinely sorry and do try  their best they should be fine with heavier stuff as well.

Ultimately, in case they don't respect your boundaries, only you can know what's gonna hurt less between two evils, loneliness or not so great friends. But I truly hope it goes well. You can get through this, I believe in you.

Also, I just wanna say that, although I don't know when or where you'll find them, there are truly wonderful people on this Earth that will respect you and appreciate you, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes.

I hope this helps and sorry if I'm not very coherent or if a few things don't make sense."

depression,eysrzb8,t3_cuag6c,1567410258.0,"First thing, professional help should be the top priority. If they won't find a therapist by themselves, sit down with them and do it together. Explain why it's important, not only for them, but for both of you, as this seems to be affecting your own mental health as well.
Also, I think once they start getting better you should express your feelings of loneliness with them. For now, though, I'd say ask how they feel and for their opinion on things and such, and they might start doing the same with you.
It's not the best idea to rely on one person to talk about your feelings. I'm sure the friends you already have wouldn't mind you venting a bit. If anything, you could seek professional help yourself. Anyone can benefit from a therapist/psychiatrist."

CongratsLikeImFive,exsfbw4,t1_exsetg1,1566542615.0,"Oh gosh. I had French for three years, and it's very similar to my native language (Italian) so it wasn't too hard, but I can't imagine learning it while sleep deprived.
Although, something that your comment made me think about: what exactly about the night makes you work better? Cause if you can figure that out and recreate those conditions during the day, it might help. It might just be the quiet, cause that's most of it for me.
Also, putting yourself under very stressful situations too often isn't very helpful to your mental health. Ideally they should never happen, but the best we can do is minimize them. I know it feels like you end up putting out better work, but if you can create something while calm and happy you'll find that you can appreciate it much more."
CongratsLikeImFive,exseiq4,t1_exsebjy,1566541885.0,"That's fair. I don't really have a lot of advice about insomnia, as I've never struggled with it, but what's important is that you get 8 hours of sleep everyday! My sleep schedule is also kinda whack to be honest, but I'll try to fix it before school starts fjdjfjsjf
I also write better at night. It's a curse and a blessing.........."
CongratsLikeImFive,exsdthn,t3_cu9l2o,1566541249.0,"That's awesome! I'm proud that you managed to do something creative that you're satisfied with. I'm sure it's a great story! However, you should put your health first. The best way to be productive is to be healthy, and a good sleep schedule is very important. 
Something I've been wanting to do recently, as I like to write a lot also, is to just write at least one phrase a day of the project I'm working on (and if then I feel like writing some more I can). I encourage you to also try this! And don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a couple of days. It's a pretty hard habit to pick up."

LFG_Europe,exqs0km,t3_cty510,1566506571.0,"These are the two ways I've found a group in the past:

Be willing to DM. Most people are just looking for a DM, and you can get a couple of people for a game in a few days like that.

Comment. Comment a LOT. Under every open post you can find, listing your qualities as a player. It's... kinda like trying to get a job fkejjfddksjdjd

Don't have any open groups myself, but best of luck! Trying to appear positive and welcoming helps a lot. People wanna play with positive people.
The second method is gonna take a few tries so don't get discouraged if the first groups don't work.
Can't think of any more advice off the top of my head but feel free to ask me anything!"

As someone else said in the comments here, it's way easier to find a party when you DM. You're the one who makes the rules, and there's just not a lot of DMs in general, so people will take whatever they can.
If it helps, I can probably run two campaigns in the summer anyway, so maybe we can keep in touch and when school ends we can form a new party?"
