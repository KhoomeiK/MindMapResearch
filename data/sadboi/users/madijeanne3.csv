PelvicFloor,f4z07vi,t1_f4vulxz,1571890183.0,"The first few months I was really depressed, I thought my life would just be like this forever. Always in pain, feeling uncomfortable with where the pain was, crying, etc... it was really doing my own research about pelvic pain and changing my perspective from feeling like a victim of my own pain to taking control of my life that really flipped the switch.

I have carried all my stresses in my body for my whole life in the form of tension. Every muscle is so tense it might as well be bone. I started small and learned how to belly breath and check myself to see if I‚Äôm tensing up anywhere in my body and then release it, multiple times throughout the day. Small steps, but it helped SO MUCH.

I‚Äôve spent a lot of money as well on pelvic pt, massage therapist, and with my cognitive therapist, but I‚Äôve had good people helping me. I first saw the pelvic pt twice a week for a month, then went to once every week for 2 months, then once every 2 weeks for 3 months, and now I go once every 3 weeks or as needed. I see my cognitive therapist every two weeks. I see my massage therapist more sporadically, usually when I need to relax more and have her do some alignment, fascia release, and deep tissue.

I recommend listening to Katy Bowman‚Äôs podcast, and reading her books. The most relaxant for me where the Diastasis Recti book and the one about foot pain. Both give wonderful stretches and a variety of exercises for relaxing and strengthening the muscles that have deteriorated. She‚Äôs a pelvic and foot specialist, so it‚Äôs some of her best work.

I hear you on the life issues. I‚Äôve been in a committed relationship for 5 years, and my boyfriend is so amazing. He‚Äôs so understanding about my pain and limitations with intimacy, and just wants me to get better. I want to have children in 3-5 years, so I really need to resolve this and get my strength back."
PelvicFloor,f4uftb8,t3_dlj1pt,1571808886.0,"I can very much relate! I have multiple on-going health issues and pelvic floor problems just felt like the worst possible cherry on top...

HOWEVER, I believe you can still improve. It‚Äôs taken me about 9 months of treatments, but my quality of life is about 80-90% better depending on the day.

What‚Äôs worked for me has been: internal massage and dry needling with my pelvic pt, seeing my therapist (for generalized anxiety disorder, childhood trauma, and PTSD), taking regular walks almost daily to keep my body moving even if it doesn‚Äôt want to, self compassion (because it‚Äôs so easy to hate yourself when you feel like your body has betrayed you), and trying to fill my life with positive podcasts/books/people."

PelvicFloor,f4uf2kv,t3_dlr2h7,1571808077.0,"Female, and while not my main symptom this is definitely in my top 3. I would say the only thing that really helped me improve with this is stretching the surrounding muscles, but mostly internal massage and dry needling around that area. 

My pelvic pt will do internal massage to loosen up the area, and the dry needling helped immensely with releasing pent up tension. Elevating my legs (think Squatty Potty) while on the toilet also helps to relax while ‚Äúgoing‚Äù.

Have you tried either of those things? Also, do you have low back pain/tailbone pain as well?"
PelvicFloor,f4b6t60,t1_f4b61lt,1571507702.0,"The following cycle I noticed a difference in the intensity of my symptoms. They were more tolerable and not as severe. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was being stabbed in the pelvis or vagina when I was on my period or during ovulation. I also made a point to walk every day even when I didn‚Äôt feel great, which helped my muscles relax as well."
PelvicFloor,f4aet0l,t3_dhjqid,1571493764.0,"I went off birth control and have noticed a difference. I also flare up around mensuration/ovulation, but it is much less now.

My hormones are also out of wack. My estrogen is wayyyy low and my pelvic PT has noticed that my vulva does not have the right coloring, likely from a lack of necessary hormones down there. So a big focus for me right now is naturally balancing out my hormones."
PelvicFloor,f4ae23z,t3_dju02e,1571493293.0,"Try walking! It seriously helps loosen my muscles up, so I usually walk and then stretch. No pain either from it!"

PelvicFloor,ezi71c1,t3_d0xpf1,1567922281.0,"I hear you! I also thought I had the worlds worst UTI but really it turned out to be a not so great pelvic floor... I also had a lot of pain in my urethra and took AZO which did help some, but not enough for my sleep either. 

What did help me was dry needling and learning to use a dilator in pelvic floor therapy. I don‚Äôt know if that works for everyone but it works like a dream for me! 

I had to start stretching my abdomen and hamstrings really good as well. My abs are so extremely tense, and it literally feels like it‚Äôs pulling on my urethra sometimes! So I do a gentle cobra pose to stretch and do some gentle massaging of my abs and pelvis. 

Also, have you tried propping your legs up while sleeping? If I sleep on my back putting a pillow under my knees or between my legs if I‚Äôm sleeping on my side, takes a lot of pressure off of my pelvis."
PelvicFloor,evmeaxs,t1_evm96hi,1564606853.0,"I can relate! My posture is terrible... I have almost no flexibility in my hips, torso, hamstrings,  calves, and low back.

During my walks I‚Äôll try to take a break every 15 minutes to just stretch down to my toes. I always just test to see how far I can get before my walk, but I always get closer my toes the longer I walk!"
PelvicFloor,evm8f9e,t3_ckca4c,1564604628.0,"I would try to do more movement if you notice that walking/jogging/etc seem to help. For me I was very afraid to move in the beginning, but now I realize that movement is what helps me feel best and increases my range of motion. 

I saw my symptoms get a lot better after 6 sessions, but after that it‚Äôs been more about changing my lifestyle to keep them from coming back or being aggravated."

I could never get through a Pap smear cos of the pain, but I was able to handle the internal ultrasound, if that puts it into perspective. Yes, it hurt, but it honestly wasn‚Äôt any worse that what I was already experiencing. Plus, they found and ovarian cyst, which while not the cause of my pain, was causing much more than I would‚Äôve had without it. I would‚Äôve never know without the ultrasound. Plus, they can always do an external."
PelvicFloor,eus6v4u,t1_eus663u,1564004040.0,"I‚Äôll do that in a bit!

That sucks that is all came on quickly... at the very least, I would try a probiotic. Not the refrigerated kind, but the regular powder capsules. My PT said to take one in the morning and in the evening, and take a magnesium supplement in the evening as well to help with muscular tension. And you want to take between 80-100 parts per billon a day. So I had a capsule that was 40ppb, that I took twice a day for about 3 months. I noticed my symptoms go away completely from that and my stretches and therapy, so now I just take them when I flare up."

I had to initially stretch only laying on my back, and doing a deep belly breath every 5 seconds. I started with a hip rotator stretch and a pelvic floor stretch, and it was HARD. I had to modify it for my pain level, but the more I did the stretching and the better I learned to listen to my body, the easier it got. 

I had to let go of my fear of the pain to be able to work through it and lessen it."
PelvicFloor,eurllks,t1_eurkycy,1563995700.0,"Okay, if you‚Äôre that tense you haaaaaave to stretch!!! Like non-negotiable. Stretch your abdominals, rib cage, and low back to focus on the direct area. Also work on stretching your glutes, hamstrings, quads, and calves. 

All the stretches that I‚Äôve gotten from my PT are in this book: Heal Pelvic Pain by Amy Stein. It‚Äôs very affordable (like $13 on Amazon), and it‚Äôll walk you through a lot of things to help heal yourself and minimize pain and discomfort."
PelvicFloor,eurcl6j,t1_eurbdpk,1563992385.0,"Hmmm. That is interesting in that it‚Äôs the movement itself that you think is causing the bloat... Do you have a doctor or PT that you are currently seeing?

If it only happens after you have a bowel movement or empty your bladder, maybe something is irritating your middle enough to cause inflammation, or air is getting into your system causing bubbles, or maybe you just aren‚Äôt emptying out all the way?

I would see some sort of professional about it if you haven‚Äôt already, but as far as the relaxing goes what have you tried?"

Also, I took an 80PPB probiotic for a few months and that helped me immensely. I had been misdiagnosed for a while and was given so many antibiotics it really messed with my stomach and my gut health. My Pelvic Floor Therapist recommended I take the probiotics to combat that and it improved my digestion in every way. Now I just take it as needed for a few days when I feel bad/yucky in my middle."
PelvicFloor,eumcurs,t3_cgd1km,1563914078.0,"I started having pain after I started working out, specifically resistance training, for the first time in a few years. I think injuries I had in the past made me more susceptible to pelvic injury, and the working out just pushed my body to its limit for tension in my pelvic floor.

Your injury definitely could have contributed, or you could have had a less stable core than you thought. It can be hard to tell if you have a fair amount of tension in your abdomen."

As far as passing the time, you maybe should look into some creative outlets! While my pain isn‚Äôt at the place where I cannot do anything anymore, I‚Äôm still not as active as I used to be.

It wasn‚Äôt until I found a pelvic floor therapist that I found any relief, and it gave me hope. She helped me with stretches, dry needling, and internal trigger point therapy. 

I 100% recommend finishing a PT who can help you with pelvic issues. I have tight muscles in my entire lower half and a weak core, which is what caused all this. Try some stretching ASAP. That should help. And do belly breathing to help relax your core. I‚Äôll link some stuff.

PelvicFloor,etud1q9,t3_cdbspt,1563209809.0,Definitely work on relaxing all those muscles too. Especially Calves and Hamstrings. If mine are too tight it feels like they pull on my pelvic floor and make everything worse!

PelvicFloor,etabjjf,t1_etab1mj,1562616545.0,"I know for me a lot has been working through a lot of muscle groups that have become extremely tense. My low back is better after needling, and I‚Äôve regained a lot of flexibility in my hips. I have a lot of work to do on my abdomen, hamstrings, IT bands, and calves still but I‚Äôm very hopeful! 

The dry needling has helped me immensely. But I‚Äôve been needled in other areas besides my pelvic floor and found that it helped my entire pelvic region. I‚Äôve had my back, glutes, inner thighs, hamstrings, quads, calves, and some of my feet done with the needling. If she‚Äôs able to confidently try any of the other areas that you know are trigger points, I would go for it.

PelvicFloor,eta5vps,t1_eta0bjs,1562612894.0,"I sit all day for mine too, so I can definitely relate. I‚Äôve had to get up at least once or twice and hour and do a full body stretch, but especially for my legs, glutes and core. I‚Äôve sat on an exercise ball at work which helped a lot since I cannot get a standing desk. 

What helped me a lot was having dry needling done by my pelvic therapist. It really helped with the trigger points in my glutes (these are the worst for me), my calves, pelvis, and my upper thighs. I would use the foam roller on your calves as well, mine were SUPER tight and my PT said that‚Äôs been the case for every one of her patients."

PelvicFloor,et6pk9x,t3_c9gijl,1562517084.0,"Do you stretch other muscle groups or just the ones in the pelvic region? 

For me, I have to work on my hamstrings and hip flexors as well because they have tightened up to the point of being able to throw the progress I‚Äôve made. I have to make sure my whole body is able to relax muscularly. 

I would also seek out some sort of therapy if you have issues with anxiety/depression. It helps immensely. You can learn mindfulness and grounding techniques to better deal with the fight or flight reaction to your pain."

I would highly recommend finding a physical therapist that specializes in pelvic floor issues. I went two months searching through so many different doctors, desperately seeking some sort of relief from extreme pain, to finding a pelvic floor therapist, who was able to help me find relief after the first session. 

So much of this is from muscular issues, for me at least, and finding someone who would recognize and work with me on that has been invaluable. I would 100% try some of the pelvic floor stretches that focus on relaxation of the pelvic floor. Gently stretch your hamstrings, quads, glutes, abdomen, and lower back to see if it can bring you some relief.

Everyone in this office is so kind and will do everything they can to help you feel better.

I‚Äôve always been a thin person, but I ended up losing 10 pounds in about 2 weeks. Now I‚Äôm struggling to put the weight back on. 

It‚Äôs such a strange thing because I love food! But when I have flashbacks or am triggered it can leave me without and appetite at all for days. I had to seek the help of a nutritionist to try and get my appetite back and get my body‚Äôs nutrition back to healthy levels.

Some people may surprise you, and really be open to hearing your struggles, but it‚Äôs your call who to open up to, and who you think can actually be receptive to your feelings.

Talking to my therapist has really helped me in this aspect. She‚Äôs also helped me come to terms with the fact that some people I‚Äôm close with will never understand what I‚Äôm going through, and that‚Äôs okay. I don‚Äôt need everyone in my life to be on that level of understanding, as long as they‚Äôre respectful and courteous of when I‚Äôm having a hard time and what triggers me.
