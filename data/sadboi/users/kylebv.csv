Loving yourself has to come first! It's not easy, not in the slightest. But when you can love you for you, your own happiness will be magnetic. You don't have to do it all at once. Hell you don't have to start to do it today, or tomorrow, or next week. You just have to get your mind ready to do it. If you can get your mind out, you can get anything out."

I lived alone for a few months. It was horrible. I kept escaping to see my family and my animals every time I felt despair. Then I decided screw it, I'm gonna move back in with my family for a few months. It was the only place I felt homely. And yet when I moved in, that feeling turned into doubt.

I managed to break through that doubt but trying to connect more with my family. I got close with my mother and step dad, and went full disclosure on what I was going through. It was worth it. We're not the most connected of families, but I feel happier than I did before."
