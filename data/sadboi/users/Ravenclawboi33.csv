AnorexiaNervosa,fr1yggd,t3_glp85w,1589828069.0,"Thatâ€™s one of the cons of same sex relationships, itâ€™s too easy to compare, especially when your partner has a different body type to you. If you talk to her about it and say that her saying that is triggering to you Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™ll understand. Also how she feels about her body is also relevant, she may not suffer from an ED or have unhealthy habits around food but itâ€™s important to keep in mind that she may not be feeling the best about her body and may have been looking for validation for you.
What I found useful was looking for what I found attractive in a girl that was the same as what I have if that makes sense. Like; sheâ€™s really pretty and has the same shaped eyes as me, or sheâ€™s really handsome and has a similar build to me. If you look at the ways you are similar rather than contrasting your differences than that can help. Feel free to dm me if you would like to chat."

ControversialOpinions,fr0pypd,t1_fnogv0s,1589803683.0,"Because the mum is carrying the baby and therefore more at risk of any health complications etc. It's why hormonal birth control is given the okay by drug regulators in women but not in men. Both have similar side effects but in men the side effects outweigh the benefits, so none are on the market. In women the health risks of being pregnant outweigh the side effects of the birth control, so drug companies are allowed to produce and sell them.

In the whole debate thing one side stands to lose more from the decision than the other. Even if there are no changes to the health of the mother (and the entire body is shifting to build a new human being so most pregnant women will experience some impacts) it will impact her life for the 9 months. She (if she is responsible) will not be able to drink, the father will. Not be able to eat certain foods, father will. Will lose a certain amount of mobility over time, father won't. 

When it comes to birth as well, that takes a massive toll on a women's body. A C-section is still surgery, carrying all the risk of infection. Prolapses are nasty. The baby can year structures down there coming out. Her pelvic floor will be weakened and that will continue to affect her for a while. All this is even more important in counties without sufficient health care, where the risk to her life is higher.

Also, although your question presumes a caring, competent father, in many societies the burden of care forms mainly on the mother. More women give up their careers after having a child then men. Overall the child will have more impact on the mother's life than the fathers.

So yes, both opinions matter but the mother's opinion cares more weight as she has more to lose."

AskLGBT,fo2lnhm,t1_fo1x04x,1587467029.0,"I agree with the majority of your points but I believe it's harmful when people say that ""there are no permanent effects"" to hormone blockers. It's even said on the NHS website which annoys me as potential side-effects should always be mentioned.

It's a common misconception that hormone blockers are 100% reversible and have no effects. The truth is we don't know as there have not been enough long term studies into the use of hormone blockers at transitioning.  
 It is true they have been used to delay puberty in people with certain medical conditions with symptoms including early onset puberty however these people then do go on to have puberty at the normal age. Hormones don't only produce the secondary sex characteristics that would cause trans people dysphoria, they also play an important role in [Bone density](https://adc.bmj.com/content/67/12/1472.short) and fertility. 

This has been shown in studies of cismen ([study 1](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/81/3/1152/2649656), [study 2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199202273260904)) who had delayed puberty due to a medical condition or treatment - they have lower bone density than other men in their age group. This may not be an immediate concern however in later life it can lead to osteoporosis. 

This is a greater concern in, for example, a biological female who was on hormone blockers before realising she wasn't trans and coming off them. [Women](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/75/2/383/2649243) have an smaller time window to build bone density than men - from around 14/15 up until they are 30, when oestrogen production drops. From that ""peak"" bone density gradually decreases throughout life, which is why old ladies are more likely to suffer from osteoporosis than old men.The lower the peak the younger bone density will drop below the osteoporosis line. Shortening that window with hormone blockers could cause serious health conditions later in life.

Also, fertility. We dont know the full extent of the impact on fertility although in my opinion this is less of a concern than bone density. If a transperson wants to fully transition after hormone blockers but also wants to have a biological child in the future [eggs and sperm can be harder to retrieve](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/aogs.13188). In most cases it is successful as this [case study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X19309255) in transmen shows. The case study also shows that most transmen aren't fully consulted about fertility which is a concern.

The only studies done in humans are on children who had hormone blockers due to cancer treatment and fertility is decreased but that can be due to a variety of factors and treatments. Other studies have been done on male rats but that is unlikely to be true of humans as well.

I agree that trans-teens should have access to treatment however like any major medical decision they should be fully informed of all the potential consequences. Saying things like hormone blockers are fully reversible and have no consequences is at the best incorrect and at the worst harmful to young trans people.

A good overview is this [short essay](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101)"

The Dutch TV host suggested that maybe Ellen knew the effect she had on people and liked her guests being a little in awe. The tabloids took that and ran with it and then there was the Twitter thread which I think is unrelated."
truelesbians,fnthus5,t3_g3so0z,1587241961.0,"I don't think it's anything to do with Nikki being trans. She had a huge online following before anyone knew she was trans (from what I know she transitioned very young and was forced to come out by someone attempting to blackmail her) and was a big part of the beauty community on YouTube with lots of supporters. I have a friend who can speak Dutch and he says what she said on the show isn't particularly rude or blunt, just a statement of fact. Nikki said that unlike the Dutch TV host Ellen didn't see her before the show so she was super starstruck when she walked on in front of the audience as that was when she first saw her. The direct translation into English made it seem more harsh then it was and the host pushed her a bit to try and get laughter and drama for his audience. Then the media took that and blew it up in a frenzy and cancel culture ran with it. 

If you treat other people badly it'll come back to bite you in the arse and that's what's happening to Ellen atm. I don't believe what they are saying about her marriage etc etc because tabloids will make up anything for a story and it's none of my business, but if multiple people say she treats people ""beneath"" her badly I'll believe it.

A potential sexual partner might be into someone and their gender but not into the genitals they have. That's not transphobic, that's just the nature of sexuality and attraction. The majority of straight people aren't sexually into same-sex genitals, the majority of gay people aren't into opposite-sex genitals. Even with bisexuals it can be tricky as I have some friends who say it doesn't matter at all to them and some who say they prefer if the gender and genital ""match"" if that's not too crude a way to put it.

If the person has had bottom surgery (which, from what I've heard is more risky and traumatic than other gender affirming surgeries) so that their genitals ""match"" their gender identity I don't see a problem with choosing not to disclose they're trans. However if not I feel like that is something that has to be disclosed and discussed before sex.
