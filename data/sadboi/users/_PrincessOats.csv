Whatever you are feeling is valid. It is incredibly complicated when a family member who is an abuser dies. I was happy she was gone, mad at how she treated me, guilty for being happy, sad because she was still my mom’s mom, and mad again that she treated half our family like angels and the rest of us like demons.

In my case, my best course of action was to avoid the wake and funeral. I could not stomach the idea of having people say good things about the woman that is, in my opinion, 50% to blame for my mental disorders.
