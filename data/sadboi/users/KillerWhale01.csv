Edit: sorry it took me some time to watch, rewatch and understand everything... so here’s what i think: 

-first of all i like how she made analogies and incite people to actually dialogue which isn’t what most pro-choice think of pro-lifer. I, myself was very apprehensive about asking about it for this exact reason.

-so onto the main subject: human foetus are human and therefore they are a person. I think it’s right. No. I think that most people even in the prochoice side of the debate believe it too it’s more of a way to not have to feel guilty. That said yes, i believe abortion to be murder. I like that she gives the example of a woman who regretted her abortion and still respect her. 
 
- most of it are though i already had but just ignored for my own convenience/ piece of mind. However I’m sadly a coward and probably won’t be an active member of the movement. I might discuss these with people around me but that’s all i can handle to do."

We went to visit one of her childhood friend for their group reunion. It’s a tropical country and it was very hot so i wear shorts (they reached the middle of my thighs) and a tank top, noting special, everybody wear similar clothes. 

Going out my uncles tell me to change because my clothes were too revealing. I didn’t and told them it was too hot to wear anything else i brought with me. 

So we went to the “party” and of course, like every time, i know nobody and was very uncomfortable but then a guy i don’t know(my mom’s friends son) said that i couldn’t be dress like that, “it was indecent and asking to be raped” so he offered to give me one of his T-shirt as it would cover me more. I declined because, again, it was way too hot that day, plus i didn’t like the way he said that.

Everyone then turned towards me and took the guy part and every adults there told me to take  and put the shirt on so i won’t look like a prostitute. I told them that i didn’t need the shirt and they could ask my mom i always wear those clothes when it was hot. They did, and my mom told me to go with the guy and take the shirt. I did, i followed him in his room to take the shirt (I’m short and the guy was tall so it reached my knees) and looked like i only wore a t-shirt for the whole night. 

When we got out of the room, one of the adults told us that i looked like i went to my lover’s room and stayed the night *wink wink*. I know it was a joke but i was already humiliated enough by having total strangers gang up on me to make me go to that guy room and change because “i looked like a prostitute” but they are my mom’s friends and i didn’t want to cause a fuss so i just locked myself in the bathroom and cried of frustration trying to calm myself as i was starting to panic.
