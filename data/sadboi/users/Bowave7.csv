Anxiety,fpk7va5,t3_gdwcei,1588689684.0,"I have never tried the dark room thing but it sounds helpful and I will try it. I definitely get the sensory overload situation... especially when I'm trying to work and others are being disruptive. I just have to focus on my breathing. Breath in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breath out for 4 seconds. Helps ground me"
Anxiety,fpdh031,t3_gcu55x,1588526809.0,"I have wondered this too....
But looking back, I think it was always there, I just didn't know. Because it was my normal. I think It started when I was a kid.
I started smoking weed and most times it helped the anxiety. Some types of weed do tend to make me anxious, but for the most part I think the weed helped.
I haven't had any now in almost 3 weeks. The first few days I felt great, but now ithe anxiety is creeping back in again. I'm not sure what to do about it. 
Do you think weed caused your anxiety? Have you tried to quit and found you were anxious? I would be interested to hear.....
I have this fear that the weed could make it worse but I don't know what else to do about it"
Anxiety,fp2h8lx,t3_gaxyk0,1588261717.0,"It's difficult to predict what your reaction to weed will be. It depends on the person, the type of weed and how you take it. 
For me, weed got me through my anxiety and depression. But for some it can worsen these symptoms.
I would suggest talking to somebody who can recommend a dosage and type that will suit your needs (here in Canada it is legal and I can discuss it with a sales person...)
Also maybe if you're going to try it, do it with a close friend who can look after you if you feel anxious or paranoid"
depression,fp2fdui,t3_gav5s6,1588260811.0,"You seem to be trying too hard to find something wrong with yourself, when really I think that there is something wrong with him.

Maybe he does care for you, and is unable to express that verbally and make a commitment.

Whatever the situation, you deserve to be loved. Take care of yourself ❤️"
depression,foysozd,t3_gaau45,1588178456.0,"I read your whole post.
My advice: Don't apologize for expressing the way you feel. I kept quite for too long, in fear of being a burden to others and it kept me from healing.
Other tings that work for me: 
1.focus on one thing at a time, like making it through until lunch, then reward yourself with a break somehow.
2. Marijuana has given me instant relief from some dark places. It affects people differently like all medications, and I am not a doctor to prescribe anything, but I know of a lot of people who use this to get through every day.
3. Anonymously Posting a feeling on reddit, where others can reply anonymously and show you that you're not alone. Where toucan write something freely and get it off your chest. Oh wait, you already did this one, way to go!"
depression,foyqgkt,t1_foxsme3,1588177286.0,"Then that is not true depression in my mind. I withdrew from everybody, I wanted nothing to do anybody's pity and hated myself even more for anybody who saw what was happening and tried to help. Please be very careful with these comments, I seriously believe this line of thinking can be harmful to vulnerable people"
depression,foxs48k,t1_foqnqrk,1588154357.0,So true. I have to learn how to live normally again.
depression,foxs2k6,t1_foqijdc,1588154311.0,"That's a little offensive, like you're suggesting I chose to be depressed because I saw it on TV?
I went through a traumatic experience o certainly didn't have a choice in the matter, I just had to adapt to a new way of living"
Anxiety,foqding,t3_g8fqgc,1587990895.0,"This happens to me too. I could be having a great day, everything going well, then the minute I lie down to try and sleep I remember something from years ago that makes me cringe, and I can't get it off my mind"
