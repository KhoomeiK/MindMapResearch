AskReddit,fnhp3aq,t3_g1jljr,1586966388.0,"When we were 10, my best friend died from leukemia. As a kid, my parents told me how many friends I was allowed to invite to my birthday parties (I’m sure you know the drill). There was a girl in my class that hadn’t been invited before because we weren’t that close, but we sat on the bus together. After my friend died, she asked me if she could come to my birthday parties now that she’s dead, seeing as I “have a spot open.”"

As a social worker who has worked with ED, one of the reframes that we help people focus on is to try to focus on your health, and not your body/calorie intake etc. 
Food is medicine! Everyone needs to eat to survive. Try to respond to your coworkers with health-focused statements. This is easier said than done depending on where you’re at, but remember that food makes your body and your mind strong and you have no reason to feel ashamed for nourishing yourself 💕 (That said, it sounds like maybe you’re not nourishing yourself as much as you deserve. I really hope you can work to focus more on the nourishment you need rather than on the ED thoughts that are stopping you from getting there)
Ideas on how to respond:
“Just keeping it cheap and getting my vegetables in!”
“Doing what I need to do to survive!”
“I’m a creature of habit- I found something I liked and I’m sticking to it!”
“Im eating everything I need to keep me going through the day!”
“I appreciate your concern for my boring ol lunch but I think I’d shock the whole office if I changed my ways, so if ya don’t mind I’d rather avoid talking more about my same ol meal cuz I’m not planning to change!”
Or some variation of those, depending on your personality. Humour is my favourite because you can get people to shut up and still come across as nice! As a vegetarian, I used to hate people commenting on whether I got enough protein (you don’t see me asking them if they got enough of their daily nutrients!), but I learned to realize people are just looking out for me because they care, and they are just genuinely curious! 
Be kind to yourself! (And to those who care about you). I would also highly recommend looking up some CBT exercises to help with your negative thoughts, a thought record is a good place to start!"

EatingDisorders,eufztmc,t3_cg6m2r,1563796274.0,"I expected that story to end differently, so well done for eating the food despite their comments!! Your progress isn't about how those comments made you feel, it's about what you were able to achieve despite what was said! I don't have disordered eating and that would still bother the fuck out of me. They have no right to make those comments so it's a huge win for you that you were able to be confronted with a trigger and power on despite it, even if you may not feel like you did. Keep going to parties! It will only get easier as you get stronger every day :)"
