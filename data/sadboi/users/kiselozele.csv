LeagueOfMemes,fqopdxn,t1_fqnrfvj,1589521031.0,"Draft came long after blind pick. Why should they remove it? Also you get the chance to play your champion no matter what. 

For beginners - smite is unlocked at level 9. You first have to get used to laning, then jungling and objectives. Step by step. You have free champs for each role I believe."
yuumimains,fqokdjt,t1_fq9jq02,1589517290.0,Why is everyone ignoring the W passive though? I can easily give my anchor insane amount of ap/ad while getting some too. I think this is much more important than the heals.
