kratom,fouoqac,t3_g9m1bw,1588087862.0,I would say to just start to dose low. It can take some time before you find your ideal dose but it's definitly better than taking too much trust me haha

kratom,fbb39sj,t3_ecch6w,1576692389.0,"From what I've heard and read, Kratom can be wonderfull to help with addictions. If you already were clean for some while, it might be difficult to limit your Kratom use. I would try to find a good balance that works well for you. Definitly don't replace one addiction with another."

benzodiazepines,fb8drqn,t1_fb8aveb,1576611719.0,I'm currently prescribed an SSRI but I definitly prefer benzo's. Definitly no long term solution but it works for now.
benzodiazepines,fb88r9i,t1_fb886s6,1576608606.0,Might be a good idea. But in general I don't think benzo's are really that common where I live.
ForeverAlone,fb4m2jc,t1_fb2v29f,1576511480.0,Thanks bro!

depression,f84v2d3,t3_dyw9tt,1574261409.0,I know this probably doesn't mean anything but I sincerely do hope something good will come your way soon. I defnitely get what you're saying although I haven't reached this point myself. I feel like I'll eventually end up with the same realization.
benzodiazepines,f827h5g,t1_f824u8c,1574185590.0,I really do appreciate that you take your time to share your experiences. The big thing for me is that I basically just don't enjoy life while being sober which makes taking breaks difficult. But I'm glad that you got out of that difficult place you were in.
benzodiazepines,f81n9zt,t3_dy4egs,1574172589.0,"Look man, I get why people give negative reactions because they see this sort of question every day. Just do some reasearch first before asking something that hundreds of people already asked before you. That being said, just be careful. Nobody starts with using xans every day. I started of with twice a week, now it's 4 times a week."

benzodiazepines,f81bo3v,t1_f80wx9w,1574160479.0,I'm afraid I eventually will go down this road but after reading this I sure as hell will try to stop myself from doing so.
benzodiazepines,f80tkvl,t3_dy9acz,1574137951.0,Thank you for this.
depression,f7ympzz,t3_dy38sl,1574097571.0,I get what your feeling. Never been diagnosed with anything (at this time) but you just feel when something's off. Mental illness can be different for everyone so definitely don't let anyone tell you that you're issues aren't serious.
depression,f7ym4y7,t3_dy4utk,1574097324.0,I feel you my friend. Been in that same position multiple times. Stay strong 💪
benzodiazepines,f7ylk6j,t3_dy3py2,1574097084.0,Damn man that's intense. I'm a bit scared that I might end up like this (not exactly the same ofc but you get what I mean) Xans and Kratom are the things that give me some joy and let me cope with this stupid life. Anyway stay strong brother 💪
kratom,f7y82gz,t3_dy2gpy,1574088975.0,"I get your concern. It's always important to take a moment and think about how much you're exactly taking and how often. I myself started off with taking Kratom a couple of times a week, now I'm dosing multiple times a day. On top of that I take all kinds of other drugs. I guess my main advice is to always keep in mind why you're taking it. And ofcourse taking a break from time to time is never a bad idea."
benzodiazepines,f7y3epz,t1_f7xtslw,1574085325.0,Wow that seems like one hell of a ride. I'm happy that your at a stable place right now.
kratom,f7xsytf,t3_dxuluj,1574073868.0,This story makes me so happy. Best of luck in the future!
depression,f7vfphj,t3_dxp0co,1574023342.0,I get the feeling man. I still sometimes do find some joy in games and music but it decreases drastically.
depression,f7lh34h,t3_dwq600,1573840309.0,I did exactly the same last year. Now I have to work full time and it just sucks. The difference between doing nothing day in - day out and working is just too big. I hate it.
Drugs,f7er37k,t3_dvrs9f,1573663950.0,Wow respect for typing down your story. Stay strong bro!
depression,f7dx4eo,t3_dvittj,1573634487.0,I feel the same my friend. I'm actually crying right now.
depression,f77ls5o,t3_duk05s,1573463294.0,I agree so much with this post damn.

benzodiazepines,f6z5yz8,t3_dtu0id,1573310011.0,Amen.
Drugs,f6z4kfw,t3_cv2w1g,1573308764.0,That's a nice combo for sure. I use Kratom daily but doing these 3 every day seems a pretty too much imo. Like someone else sai it's better than beinig an alcoholic but I would try to taper a bit if I was you.
ForeverAlone,f6yx54y,t3_dts605,1573302224.0,"Same until last year, when I went to a stripclub while being pretty drunk. Was pretty fun in general."

Drugs,f6wjgw7,t1_f6umk0x,1573228003.0,I agree with that. But I also do think that people shouldn't be blind to the dangers that can be caused by taking any kind of drugs on a daily basis. That's why I think it's good that OP shared his story.
Drugs,f6u4hsw,t3_dt0jjp,1573157991.0,I take Kratom daily for a while now and this is the first thing I ever read about this. It's good to also share this kind of information although lots of people won't like to hear it.
kratom,f6tfvxy,t3_dsyuw2,1573148316.0,Sounds familiar. Just stay hydrated and I also wouldn't start with 3gr.

kratom,f6ll7gc,t3_drobvn,1572951224.0,Only my mother and some friends know. I don't tell a lot of people because I think most aren't very open minded about that kind of stuff. I work in an office and I always go eat by myself when everyone else is working so I can toss and wash my kratom.
depression,f613zh7,t3_dpzezp,1572632571.0,It seems like you put a lot of effort into trying to make your life better. Ofcourse I'm never gonna recommend suicide to someone but after reading all of this I definitely get why you want to end your life. I hope you do find some joy in your last days. Peace.

Drugs,f5h8wzr,t3_delb7v,1572202271.0,I would say just some amphetamine. Hear a lot of things about NEP and Hexen but don't really know all too much about that.
ForeverAlone,f4r0xlp,t3_dlgeyn,1571761025.0,You still did great tho! Going to a bar alone is something I'm scared of doing and somehow you managed to do that + have some decent conversations. Well done!
