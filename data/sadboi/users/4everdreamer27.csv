AskHistory,fcp4tlw,t3_eia85r,1577850491.0,"It all depends on the era added in with culture. From most sources that I've read, women would typically use rags or would make underwear-like articles of clothing to wear during their cycle. Here's an article on some of the various ways cultural groups did this: https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/stressbuster-epaper-strbusen/10+unbelievable+things+women+used+to+handle+periods+before+sanitary+pads+and+tampons+were+invented-newsid-78841309

As for free bleeding, this more than likely happened within tribes or groups that had a custom of sending women off to a particular location during the span of their cycle.

The best bet would be to talk to her about her asexuality so you can hear more about it from her viewpoint and get a better idea on how to go about things. If you're already accepting of it, and she seems pretty open about talking about her sexuality, I don't think you have much to worry about. Remember to be patient if necessary and to communicate any time you're unsure about something. I'm sure you'll do just fine."
