I started with weekly blood draws then to monthly and now every other month. At 33 I am underweight and active and fit and you‚Äôd never know my liver and spleen are crap, I have gastrointestinal issues (cyclical vomiting syndrome) and simply will never be able to be 120 or even 130 at 5‚Äô6‚Äù like the doctors want.

Hemochromatosis,f6x7x2w,t1_f6ufhyi,1573244028.0,You too!!!!! And I am so happy I did! My old primary was terrible. Literally would walk in the door and he‚Äôd auto insist on bloodwork and then a 2 minute ‚Äúexam‚Äù. And yet never caught hemo and was deaf to my concerns galore. But being married at the time and very sick - I was under then husbands insurance and his family‚Äôs doctor and so on..... unfortunate. Go figure we divorced bc he couldn‚Äôt handle me getting increasingly ill. The irony hah! But man daily issues..... I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 105-108lbs atm. And hemochromatosis but anemic due to organ damage so I‚Äôm pin thin and covered in bruises and that‚Äôs the tip of my health issues. Day to day for everyone is never easy. We all just need to try our best!

Swapped to a new physician and boom, she figured it out instantly! My liver enzymes hit 700s and I have organ damage (sorry spleen, we had a good run lol) and a slew of health issues despite looking so healthy and being active as heck unfortunately. It‚Äôs really sad.... I wonder what could have been had it been figured out years ago before physical and mental illness was triggered hard core, and sadly with it, substance abuse (I went to treatment willingly)! I‚Äôm just trying my best and am grateful for my amazing primary, hematologist, gastroenterologist and hepatologist.

She‚Äôs just very controlling over everyone and everything and impossible to please but fortunately she‚Äôs had some breakthroughs here and there. She keeps forgetting I‚Äôm 32 and pay my own way and so on and have my own career though. I‚Äôm genuinely exhausted of days off like today spent doing her errands bc just when I think I am bad I know she will explode if things don‚Äôt go her way.

However, this is the environment I grew up in here - private schools, controlling moms, always pushing us to the limit. She and other friends moms do not believe in self care and if it were up to her I would have a tracking device on me. I am barely able to leave for work let alone a trip to the store and yet I happily moved back in to help them out post retirement. I regret it as apparently I‚Äôm the bad guy and up to no good for even stopping to eat alone for 30 min after a 2 hour stop and go traffic filled commute from hell.

My uncle had the most amazing street smarts, sass, ‚Äòtude, understood he was different and owned it!!!!, turned every trip to the hospital into a positive experience and was grateful for every moment of his 56 years of life and was literally the life of every party! He never let anyone, any illness or incident along the way, any comment, any looks or so on bring him down. His Alz/Dementia was a 10 year downfall however and began so gradually it was hardly noticeable. A huge shout out to UCI here - we have a pioneer in this field who took him on and while it was heartbreaking, she did house calls on her own time and was such a comfort as he was able to go in his room at home and she made the final visit to let us know it was time. Gait Apraxia was the worst physically for us as one literally forgets how to walk or stand instantly on top of the moods and behavior of course.

I am tired of people describing and treating this debilitating lifelong illness as a joke, condition, trendy term, excuse for their bad mood and so on. Last time I checked, it‚Äôs resulted in handcuffs, hospitals, rehabs, constant anxiety, lots of medical conditions co-occurring and daily guilt bc of how much shit I‚Äôve done while hypo with no fear of consequences combined with blacking out that has led me to try substances to cope at times and so on.

Go home. Sleep. You develop a thick skin for this line of work. If it was a maaaaajor case for the team we would legit celebrate with a spontaneous quick break and hugs and then get right back to it.

technology,f510glr,t1_f50movt,1571935533.0,"Agreed. Father is highly educated and retired now but was one of the most highly respected LCSWs here.

EMTs are also paid peanuts! The people who save you and are overworked! I also moderated for certain huge companies that (sarcasm) low key rule and are known world wide.  Just like any other job, still needed my B.A., still needed to at least be working on a grad degree - to ‚Äúsimply moderate.‚Äù Sadly what it got down to is the basic crap aka ‚Äúrequires TONS of education and experience! Also, ‚Äúcan you maintain a sense of humor/sarcasm when confronted with horrific situations?‚Äù ..... oh and still be referred and get hired. First time I was 6 of over a 1.5k applicants during round one alone - we were the only ones hired.

confessions,f4wyiym,t1_f4s3x2m,1571860870.0,"‚ÄúPre-Suicide‚Äù tends to mean immediately giving away items from small to of irreplaceable value as if a sudden life will was written.

I could go deeper but that being said - take advantage of the services, hotlines etc in your area. It is true sometimes we do simply need a friend and it‚Äôs loneliness - but that‚Äôs a lot to carry and a broad assumption as often it is much deeper and as sufferers-we may have not even processed this or that unfortunately.

Your pup has had a full life and if anything, I recommend calling a vet who does house calls as a major surgery this late is most likely going to cause even more stress. My two Schnauzers at the time got to grieve as my big girl passed peacefully at home in the place she knew and loved with her best buddies and all of us with her in comfort and peace.
