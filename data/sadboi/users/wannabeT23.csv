I'm middle aged, quit real estate, went back to school  full time for a masters in mental health counseling, just finished the program and start full time as a therapist next week.  

It's harder than you think.  You can go months without a sale, and then have several close all at once.   You should have 6 months worth of living expenses saved before you even think about giving up  Your day job. And if it's a buyer's market where you are, make sure that you're representing buyers. If it's a seller's market, make sure you're representing sellers and not vice versa. 

The worst is to be representing buyers in a seller's market! There's bidding wars on every property and you have to find 4 or 5 properties before an offer is accepted. So basically you're doing your job 4 to 5 times for one paycheck.  It's very competitive and cut throat in most markets. 

 If you have the opportunity to do rentals, absolutely do that. It's a much shorter sales cycle, more consistent income and much easier.

GOOD LUCK!"

psychotherapy,f95asdu,t3_e3rbw9,1575123543.0,"I am both a client and a Master's level Therapist and i greatly prefer the original layout.  I think that the angled couch could be very interesting therapeutically as you could see if anxious clients move closer to your chair as the therapeutic bond stengthens.  Additionally, having the client be able to gaze out the window is giving the them the best seat in the house.  Having the  client with their back to the window can be anxiety provoking AND It may prove distracting for you and potentially reduce your ability to be fully present for your clients.  

I'm a big fan of color and would want to get some fun pillows or an interesting patterned rug to spice up the space.  

Let us know what you decide."

mentalhealth,exzpst6,t3_cuvh0g,1566669375.0,"I can totally relate!  One thing that i learned a while ago was that everyone in this world will die with a to do list.  I found that information to be very freeing.

However, i still want to feel accomplished so every day i look at my to do list and make a short list of what things i can reasonably get done that day.  At the end of the day, if i completed my list i feel that i have 'won' the day and earned a 'W"" which i put on my calendar.  At the end of the month if i have 25 'W's"" i reward myself with a massage or something else I've identified to work towards.  Obviously, you can make your own rules but doing it this way has been a life changer for me.  Good luck!!"
