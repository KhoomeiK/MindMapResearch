DPH,fn55iim,t1_fmqaheh,1586656418.0,"I know. Thing is, I have a shitloaaaaaad of benzos on me right now (including clonazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, bromazepam and the mentioned diazepam), and trying a lot of combinations right now. I agree it made it more like ""What the fuck is going on?"" No visuals, or only mild visuals, but the delirium and brain fog made it even more insane"
DPH,fmo6z7j,t1_fmmku51,1586247695.0,"That was kind of obvious to me. I wanted to know how it would affect the delirium and hallucinations, rather than the generic, shallow info they would put in a leaflet"
DPH,fmo6vr9,t3_fw50em,1586247592.0,"For any of you interested, the visual and auditory hallucinations were suppressed greatly (felt more like 250-300mg visuals), but the anxiety and restlessness were also greatly suppressed
Overall I'd say its not worth it to take DPH while any benzo is in your body"
DPH,fmj625h,t3_fv9zhj,1586123764.0,"Cheers man! I'm tripping on DXM and DPH today as well. Going for \~500-600 HBr, and maybe 250 DPH"

dxm,fhxqyiq,t1_fhxq6wj,1581960412.0,"Understood. I'd like to be able to smoke on dxm.. Unfortunately weed is too strong for me.

I don't understand people taking insane amounts of benzodiazepines, to fall asleep in 5 minutes or lose control of yourself and do some stupid shit.
Enjoy Brother!"

That's why I did 2 tests, to be sure it was LSD. In contact with other lysergamides, it can be green, or yellow. It's probably like others above say, once the peak wore off, I just didn't notice the visuals... I don't know. Going to try 2 tabs next time. Those three hours yesterday were the best moments of my life anyway!"
