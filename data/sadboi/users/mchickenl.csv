I tell her I'm going to my aunt's so it doesn't get worse and later in the day I get these messages.
Edit: to make things more clear, she overreact to everything, when I say she complains about me waking her all I have to do to 'wake' her is be awake when she happens to wake to go to the loo.
And Tyler while he might as well be my dog and I am considering getting him made into my emotional support dog he isn't actually mine. She bought him and then forced me to look after him full time coz I didn't have anything else to do with my life. I can't go out to see friends coz then I'm abandoning him and am made out to be a bad guy.

However, it may fall under the broad category of specific phobia if the fear is excessive, persistent, and associated with significant distress or impairment.

Whether trypophobia can be accurately described as a specific phobia might depend on whether the person mainly responds with fear or with disgust. Because phobias involve fear, a response to trypophobic imagery that is based mostly or solely on disgust renders its status as a specific phobia questionable. In one study, most of the participants with trypophobia met the DSM-5 criteria for specific phobia, even though they experienced disgust instead of fear when shown imagery of clusters of holes; however, they did not meet the distress or impairment criterion."
