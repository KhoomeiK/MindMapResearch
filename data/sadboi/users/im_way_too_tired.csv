I'd say try to ask questions that make you seem genuinely interested, but not nosey or aggressive.

We just ask that you aren't campaigning for two parties in the same election because, well, obviously we'd like your full support. But also what if you go door knock on some person's house twice, once is to support Party A and then twice is to support someone else. On that note, you _can_ campaign for another candidate of the same party in the same election. My fellow party candidates frequently shared volunteers from our campaigns for the benefit of the national party overall.

Hope you enjoy it! It's a rewarding experience to work on a campaign and fight for policy that you believe in!"

The Pentagon attack alone likely would've been enough to trigger the same level of response by the US. On the other hand, if only one out of four planes actually hit their intended targets, it's also possible that the US might've tried to spin it and focus on the three planes that were stopped. (This of course depends on the context of your post - did they hit the towers at all or were they stopped beforehand?)

As for what specific advantages the government would've had thanks to the towers not falling, if they had still been hit, I think that was already answered better than I could by u/mbattagl"
