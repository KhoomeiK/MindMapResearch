bipolar,fqmop8n,t1_fqmdhu2,1589480955.0,"Thank you! I have almost 18 months of DBT to thank for that...

And thanks for the tip. I always take my meds in the morning since my bed time varies but I wake up at almost the same time every day. So glad to hear it’s working for you. That makes me hopeful!"
bipolar,fqm4hv5,t1_fqm3cqt,1589471361.0,"Patience for sure—they’re also adjusting to my presence, so it’s a two-way street.

I am constantly diminishing and downplaying the situation(s) my bipolar 2 puts me in and this one is no exception. I’m trying to allow myself to recognize the significance of what’s happened to me, but I have so much responsibility in my career life right now (it’s all COVID-related work) that I am struggling to get balance.

I agree. Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I’m going to wait it out here for at least several weeks so I know how it affects me before moving back to my home (which is out-of-state and mostly solo living)."
bipolar,fqm361n,t1_fqm2sfz,1589470705.0,[yes yes yes. I just ordered this one:](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077VLFCML/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_DvwVEbQQASC4H)
bipolar,fqm2jjk,t1_fqm2d1q,1589470396.0,"The problem is she doesn’t want me getting back on it now that she can’t monitor me—I reacted with a benign skin rash when we first started and did all the SJS bloodwork (negative). But she’s still concerned, and I get it. Oh well. Just wish I hadn’t incidentally made it harder for myself! I’m ordering a pill box pronto."
bipolar,fqm24ao,t1_fqlzd1l,1589470185.0,"Good to know. Because I’m a genius, I misunderstood my doc’s instruction to take Abilify as an instruction to go off my other med (Lamictal) so that’s probably also screwing me over a bit. Ugh. All of this is such a chore. I just want some mood consistency.

Thanks for your thoughts. I definitely don’t feel miserable on it but I’m proceeding with caution."
bipolar,fpf6vtg,t1_fpf5nvp,1588563223.0,Thank you. I can’t believe how much better I feel right now
bipolar,fpf0wdq,t1_fpf0pyy,1588559220.0,Not a bother! It was delicious and easily replicable so I’m happy to share!

bipolar,fpf0kyc,t1_fpf08m6,1588559013.0,It’s a Blue Apron my mom sent me because she knows I’m not eating lol. It came with a special paste or two but the soy glaze and everything else can be easily purchased or remade! Let me see if I can post a pic of the recipe
bipolar,fpevbh4,t3_gd1gg5,1588555724.0,100%. That’s good advice in any situation.
bipolar,fpeuu30,t1_fpetrt7,1588555418.0,"While the good day(!) you’re describing can’t always be separated wholly from a manic experience, I don’t think all of our productivity has to be pathological!"
bipolar,fo1830g,t3_g53crn,1587427669.0,"I would definitely call your psychiatrist immediately. I got a benign rash from Lamictal, but it still required bloodwork to confirm it wasn’t dangerous, and I had to lower my dose and slowly start back up to let me body readjust."
bipolar,fn8rz9d,t1_fn8rgfd,1586748720.0,That’s a good idea. I just messaged my psychiatrist lol. Always good to reach out to someone who can help!
bipolar,fn8qygp,t3_g03eex,1586747970.0,I love being high but last night I actually had my very first bad “trip” (probs not the right term for weed) and it was nothing I want to do again. It made me paranoid and saw things that weren’t there (which has happened to me before in very depressive episodes like I am going through now). I just smoked a little bit and only took two hits which feels good and not bad right now. I think it can be used with discretion but that can be hard to do with BD!
bipolar,fn8qqs3,t3_g09mf9,1586747819.0,"Thank for your feeling like you could just write all of this out. I can’t imagine having to deal with all of that.

Do you have any tools you can use to alleviate stress?"
bipolar,fn8qlbu,t3_g0a5ev,1586747716.0,Is there another ER you can go to?
bipolar,fn8qf4n,t1_fn8qdl9,1586747593.0,"I don’t think we can always control our minds, but sometimes we can try if we know how. DBT is really good for that."

bipolar,fhsqszn,t1_fhrl87f,1581864185.0,"Understandable, though the rash (as I understand) is quite uncommon. I did get a benign skin reaction in the form of acne, but we did the bloodwork for SJS and it came out negative."
bipolar,fhqq5uq,t3_f4gq9s,1581808775.0,"I’m on 100mg of lamictal but I got a Kyleena IUD a little over a year ago. Love the IUD (and lamictal) but I know it’s not for everyone. If you’re worried about the pregnancy risk, maybe ask your GYN/PCP about alternative options? I have friends who have used the shot and the implant..."

bipolar,fhqjp9x,t3_f4e73d,1581805396.0,Wow. This is so evocative. I’m saving it on my phone to look at later!
insomnia,fhqjkxe,t3_f46jta,1581805333.0,"Ugh, this is so relatable. I’m sorry.

If it helps, I use an app called Headspace to try and fall back asleep—they have soundscapes that can help lure me back to sleep. It can be cost prohibitive (it’s $70/per year) but it can help me sneak back in 1-2 more hours sometimes which is worth the investment when I’m super manic."

bipolar,fhcosb4,t1_fhcbhwt,1581467525.0,"I just routed some of my paycheck to an emergency fund, though unfortunately I think I’ll drain that to pay for therapy next month. At least it’s there.

Thanks for sharing your story—it’s hopeful to me. I think I also need to be reminded of my long-term goals which will motivate me to spend less on a weekly basis."
bipolar,fhc5tk8,t1_fhc54cr,1581456798.0,"It’s possible that I could do that—the problem is that I’m pretty reliant on my credit card to survive right now until I get back in the positive (if I keep up this budget, I’ll have it paid off at the end of March). I’d like to go off the credit card completely by the summer. 

I don’t have a partner or family nearby, and I’m not sure if I have a friend I’m comfortable enough with to admit that I have a spending problem—even the ones who know about my diagnosis. It causes me a lot of shame. I may have to get over that if I want to dodge this in the future."
bipolar,fhby9nu,t3_f2e8qv,1581452413.0,"As a side note, I think I have justified this spending in the past because it's mostly on eating out (it's so hard for me to cook food when I'm depressed, and when I'm manic I'm often doing so many activities that cooking comes last in my mind). I also overspend on pretty ""regular"" items, like books, thrifted clothing, household items, etc. (i.e. I'm not buying expensive TVs or designer clothing). But just because my spending looks ""normal"" it doesn't mean that it is."
bipolar,fhbx0bv,t3_f29j7k,1581451658.0,This means so much to me. Thank you for sharing this. I have made comics in the past and this has inspired me to think about making a comic about my mother's suicidal ideation/depression and the history of mental illness in my own family. Thank you.
bipolar,fh9womc,t3_f1yhbm,1581391350.0,"I usually sleep at least a little bit when I’m hypomanic, but there’s always 2-5 days of a complete crash in my energy level as I come off the episode. I usually have to miss work just to be still and sleep. I’m essentially useless for any activity during that time but laying down and resting."
bipolar,fh9w989,t3_f1yjvh,1581391062.0,Yum!
bipolar,fh9w7o6,t3_f1yb2h,1581391034.0,"Like others here, I didn’t even know it was possible to be classified as being in full remission—this is a huge hope to me. Thank you. I hope you find ways to celebrate this."
bipolar,fh9vzxw,t1_fh9m6di,1581390892.0,"Maybe—I would ask your doc for their opinion. My psychiatrist thinks it’s a benign acne “rash,” especially considering I’m breaking out in places that weren’t usual for me (chin, jaw, around the ears) before I went on Accutane in 2011. The acne itself often appears small but clustered, changing the texture of my skin in some areas. I use benzoyl peroxide cream from CVS to tackle it which does a decent job but requires reapplication at least 2-3 times a week before bed for me. I haven’t looked at this [article](https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2004/v65n12/v65n1219a.aspx) yet but the literature I have seen makes me feel like even though the symptom may not be widely reported, there’s likely a correlation."
bipolar,fh8tdmi,t3_f1vy2v,1581366975.0,"I am SO GLAD that you posted this. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last fall, I described (what I didn't know was) hypomania as getting a star in Mario Kart while driving on Rainbow Road, except the power-up (and the road) never stopped--like you can't brake or exit. Neither of them (my therapist or psychiatrist) understood the reference (lol) but it was one of the only ways I knew how to describe it."
bipolar,fh7qvom,t1_fh7py3h,1581342190.0,Another thing: does anyone else simply forget to take their meds when they're feeling good/hypomanic? I just got to work and realized I think I only took my meds once in the last three days. It's not intentional at all; I just completely forget. I need to start carrying some around with me so that I can take it when I remember.
bipolar,fh7q1vb,t3_f1hwri,1581341493.0,Yep. All the time.
bipolar,fh7py3h,t3_f1oxyu,1581341402.0,"Curiosity for folks also on Lamictal (lamotrigine): does anyone else experience (1) an uptick in acne on their face and chest, and/or (2) a noticeable increase in facial hair growth (in my case, what's called ""peach fuzz"")?

My psychiatrist has referred me to a dermatologist just to make sure my skin reaction is benign (we've already done the blood work for SJS) and I haven't told her yet about the facial hair growth."
bipolar,fgtjylo,t3_f0e7lk,1581105433.0,"I appreciate this post a lot. I definitely experience heightened nervous energy and anxiety when I'm hypomanic that manifests pretty physically. My nervous system feels like its on high alert and I can find it difficult to breathe deeply. I (gratefully) have not had many full-fledged panic attacks in my life, but how I describe it to my therapist is that I feel like I'm on the edge of having a heart attack because I'm just so gripped by excitement. It's not necessarily an unpleasant feeling, but it's not comfortable."
