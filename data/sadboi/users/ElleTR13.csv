My recent reads (not really YA):
*Daisy Jones and The Six* - 5 Stars! I wish I had listened to it but with a 4 month old, my attention span is shot

*Such a Fun Age* - 3 Stars

*Chain of Gold* - 3 stars. I usually make my decisions on her series after all the books are out.

fitpregnancy,fc476tr,t3_edtyf9,1577408461.0,"I was overweight when I got pregnant. I had been working out consistently and making a somewhat half-assed attempt at Weight Watchers. I’d lost maybe 10-12 lbs before I got pregnant. 

I’m now 39 weeks and going in for an induction Monday. I’ve gained around 30lbs total. My doc says I’m “all baby” which surprised me - I went into this thinking I’d balloon up fast bc I’ve always gained weight quickly.  FWIW, I’ve been on metformin and thyroid meds the whole time due to PCOS.  I’m sure every body is different, but this is what I’ve done:

I kept up my 2x/week HIIT class until 34 weeks (I mean, I missed some throughout), though I started modifying and reducing impact early in the 2nd tri. I also did some prenatal workouts, and yoga (though as I sit here 4 days from induction...not enough yoga). And walked
The dogs basically every day.

Diet-wise, I made a lot of the same things I did when I was doing weight watchers just because we liked the recipes 🤷🏼‍♀️ I didn’t measure portions or anything. I gave in to some cravings and we definitely have had more sweets in the house the last 9 months. I tried to eat more veggies and fruit, but this kid has had more than her fair share of CFA, pizza and chocolate milk!

I think focus on what makes you feel good and go from there. Don’t try to install a new diet or plan. It’s overwhelming enough!"
