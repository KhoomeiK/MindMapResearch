I think most of us can relate in some way to your situation. In many ways, you couldn‚Äôt leave the house much since March because of the pandemic and that makes everything harder- it sets the clock back on how long it‚Äôs been, which makes getting back out harder. 

I know you were venting and when we‚Äôre venting we don‚Äôt usually want advice, but in case you do: try to hear support that you don‚Äôt need to go straight to 100. No one is going to be able to go back to 100% after this. Thank goodness we don‚Äôt have to. Thank goodness we are opening in stages because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôll need to get back to my life. If you can make a goal to go to the corner store again, that‚Äôs step 1. Or walk around the block. I‚Äôm not trying to act like you‚Äôre ridiculous, my son is in the same exact place and I am with him all day holding space for him. 

People care about you. You‚Äôre not lost on this. You‚Äôve made more progress than you give yourself credit for. You are loved.
