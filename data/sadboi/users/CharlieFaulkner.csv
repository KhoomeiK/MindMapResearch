Edit: I now realise you were referring to can it cause physical illness - of that I'm not 100% certain but physical health of course often declines with mental health (and energy/tiredness and co-ordination are specific things I've noticed in myself and folks I know which are often affected by lower moods) so I'd imagine so"

NoStupidQuestions,fgs401y,t3_ezsigm,1581070429.0,"Combination of upbringing and selection bias would be my guess, like... especially for race people do tend to pick up the vocal mannerisms and accents of the people they were around when they were younger, and if your brain is expecting this to be the case it could be subconsciously downplaying exceptions to the ""rule"" it expects to see, amplifying the effect

This actually made me think about something else I'm now curious about however... why can you hear someone's personality in their voice, kind of? Like... most of the people I've heard who've got softer voices tend to have gentler dispositions, as just one example - people's voices and characters seem to oddly synergise in a way
I spose this could be selection bias as well, but I'm sorta curious now and wonder if anyone else experiences this at all"

BUT they do it because they want to bring you a gift or they think they're helping you eat, and he wanted to do this despite being so nervous so he brought in a leaf (which is adorable enough on its own).
