I felt the same even when the show first aired though back then this storyline was obviously a much bigger deal than it is now. For me, she was always this martyr who was just seen through her HIV-status and it defined her, so it didn’t do much for me in terms of raising awareness of HIV. I also thought it was inexcusable that she got back together with her husband who cheated right, left and centre, but pushed away other love interests who were fully aware of her HIV status and cared for her regardless. And then she used her HIV status to get the job back and turn on another person who really cared about her and went out of her way to help her. Sure, probably karmic payback for Kerry who stabbed people in the back on a regular basis, but nonetheless, a really shitty thing to do on Jeanie’s part. And from her cameo in later seasons, we also find out that her marriage broke apart because she spent all her time at the HIV clinic, so again everything in her life was just centred around her HIV status. One dimensional writing at its best."

He’s talking about sociopathy here, which is believed to be primarily caused by one’s often traumatic childhood environment and upbringing. Psychopathy, on the other hand, is believed to be associated with more biological causes and is something that people are usually born with due to underdeveloped parts of the brain that are responsible for emotions, feelings and empathy. I’m not sure I would call either of them a survival strategy though. They’re more of a consequence of an environmental or biological trauma, which often results in more trauma for people associated with sociopaths or psychopaths due to actions taken by them."
Anxietyhelp,fr0kgpc,t3_glv60e,1589798821.0,"She sounds like a narcissistic bully and I’m not sure that taking the high road really works with people like her. In her eyes, you can’t really do anything right, but it’s nothing to do with you. It’s simply because she has deep-seated contempt for most (if not all) people. So even if you’re nice, she’ll use it at some against you, because she just has to bring people down to maintain her inner vision of the world. I’d suggest avoidance at all cost and if that’s not possible because your work roles are too connected, maybe look for another job? Life’s too short and people like that hardly ever change, because they’re not very likely to seek help/therapy because of their narcissism (i.e. in their eyes, nothing’s wrong with them). Oh, and the fact that she’s seemingly nice to other people is maybe just an illusion too. If she is the way some other similar people in my life are, she is probably very quick to anger and often just uses those other people to do things for her like work so that she could then enjoy the accolades. People like that see other human beings as existing to serve for their benefit. So while being nice to her only might make your life a bit easier, it seems to be eating you up inside because deep down you know what she’s like and you maybe feel you’re not being your true self by pretending that everything’s fine when it’s far from it. I’d advise the path of being diplomatic and interacting with her when you absolutely have to, but not pretending that you are her friend. You’re colleagues and it’s certainly ok to have rather reserved relationships with your colleagues, especially those ones you don’t like very much as people. And if she exhibits any of her abusive behaviours, document them, make sure you have a proof, copy people in your email responses etc. Bullying is not acceptable and remember that she would potentially have a lot to lose if you ever decided to make a formal complaint."
hsp,fr0fwkr,t3_glpuck,1589794191.0,"It’s funny you should because just last night I was thinking about posting a similar question here. For me, it’s more to do with the type/quality of conversations I usually have. I find that most people I know just want to talk about themselves and hardly anyone ever shows true interest in my life, so I default to the ‘listening and giving free therapy/solving others’ problems’ mode, which is exhausting and most often than not, makes me avoid most (though not all) people. I notice this particularly now when all my interactions are online because of the lockdown and it’s virtually impossible for me to get a word in because I always wait for other people to finish and usually try and relate to what they’ve just said and it’s harder to feel the flow of the conversation online without the body language, issues with connection, timing of sound etc. Online and in real life, most people I know tend to just talk about whatever’s on their mind, even when it’s not really to do with what others have said. I see that all the time and from my perspective, it’s really draining and makes it pointless to have a conversation/work meeting in the first place. I do have odd conversations here and there when I feel truly seen and when sharing things feels good because I know I will be understood. I must, however, admit that the older I get and the more I get to know myself, the more I realise how rare these moments really are and that they are mostly limited to my therapy sessions..."
ershow,fqwihx1,t3_gl5cop,1589705651.0,"Here’s my downvote for making me believe I was just about to hear the real deal, which I do love btw! I was really disappointed to see that they changed it in later seasons, especially that the new version was so crap."
ershow,fqq28q1,t3_gkaval,1589558150.0,"So...

1. Erin was such a memorable(not) character that I had to google her to even remind myself who she was. I really don’t think she and Luka would have been a good pair. They were polar opposites from what we do know about Erin, which isn’t a lot because she was such a blah background character. And nothing ever really happened between them anyway apart from that car accident of course! She was just yet another prop for the show to depict how totally messed up Luka was. 

2. I actually thought that Luka’s Africa departure made WAY more sense than Carter’s and came at a much more timely point in the show. Luka was a self-destructive trainwreck at that point and him going away to Africa in search of some sort of deeper meaning, personal catharsis or tabula rasa (or whatever) actually made sense. There was a lot of build up to that in the preceding episodes while Carter just up and left out of nowhere without even telling Abby even though the writers had spent two whole seasons building up to them finally becoming a couple. 

3. As much as I liked Carter, he was an asshole for the way he broke up with Abby. No doubt about that. 

4. Abby’s is a complex character and Maura Tierney did a fantastic job playing this character with a lot of grace and making it likeable even when it was hard to like or even approve of some of Abby’s behaviours. Having watched all seasons, I’m still not entirely sure if either of those guys was actually good for Abby. I did eventually come to like Luka and Abby together (in later seasons), but I think Abby was at her best when she was single and devoting her attention to her career and personal improvement. 

5. I think it was the other way round, i.e. it was Kem who found it hard to move on and was still in mourning several years later. She even says so herself in the very last episode. I see this as one of the reasons why she and Carter never really got back together. He (and Chicago) only reminded her of her son’s death."

His relationship with Kem was doomed from the start and in that last episode I just saw signs of Carter finally realising that and choosing to focus on what he always loved - his ER work and family."
ershow,fq75rt7,t1_fq6fbb5,1589142152.0,Yeah I mentioned the same in one of my comments on this subreddit. I always thought that Pratt should have been the one to be told by Carter to ‘set the tone’.

I read somewhere though that Abby and Carter were supposed to be the end game until the show writers’ ‘creative differences’ on the character’s future storyline.

What surprised me was that I wasn’t matching with any of the guys I liked even though I was always sending a comment on a pic or an interesting question etc. and I wasn’t terribly picky about the profiles either. There were quite a few guys I thought I would have quite a lot in common with based on their profiles and I didn’t even manage to match with one of them even though ppl get a notification when sb sends them a like and can view their whole profile so it’s not ‘blind matching’ like Tinder etc. One of the redditors suggested I should widen the age range so I now set it to 29-45. It definitely helped with getting more likes (albeit, only from the group of men over 40) but still hardly any matches on the likes I send. You might be right in saying that men our age prefer to use their likes on women who are younger. I think it’s partly because of the fact that a lot of men our age don’t want to settle down yet, so being in a relationship with somebody in their 20s makes more sense to them. Just like you though, I am highly educated (to a phd level), with a good and well-paid job and fairly attractive (not a supermodel but certainly very slim, fit etc.). I had one of the redditors review my pics for me and they thought they were very good. I also included a lot of info on my interests/hobbies so plenty of stuff for me to come up with an opening question. I’m a foreigner here in Scotland though I don’t sound like it but ppl wouldn’t of course know that unless they actually met me, so I’m thinking that this might be one of the factors that works against me apart from the age and app (un)popularity in my local area. Thanks again for your reply and best of luck with your dates :)"
AnimalsBeingBros,exwod8b,t1_exw4481,1566622351.0,What are you talking about? You stole it from Tik Tok yourself. It’s clear from your post history.
glee,exwl3gb,t1_exuwrs8,1566620928.0,Maybe you should start - it can be quite fun. Just a thought.
hingeapp,exsbo78,t1_exrujw8,1566538952.0,"Thanks for the offer, but one of the redditors have already reviewed my profile and gave me a couple of tips, which I followed. Other than that, my pics are apparently very good."
hingeapp,exsblv7,t1_expdbyp,1566538879.0,"Thanks, I widened the age and distance range a bit. I don’t have any other dealbreakers set on my profile."
hingeapp,exhkwa7,t1_exh19xl,1566307807.0,"I was looking for some insights into what other factors might impact on the number of likes/matches one gets, which quite a few people mentioned on here. And yeah, it is my personal preference not to post stuff on imgur, especially that I don’t even have an account there."
hingeapp,exh000d,t1_exgf6vn,1566283712.0,"Thanks for the offer but I can’t send any pics in a DM on Reddit and I don’t want to post anything on imgur - feels far too public to do that, but thanks for the offer. I appreciate it."
hingeapp,exgzxad,t1_exgk0rb,1566283587.0,"I tried Bumble in the past and went on a lot of dates and even dates somebody for a few months, but it still seemed like a lot of people on there weren’t looking for anything too serious so I thought Hinge would be a good alternative. And yeah, I agree that a lot of men seem to be using multiple apps at the same time. I’ve seen that both online and IRL."
hingeapp,exgzu9c,t1_exgrbqe,1566283455.0,"Thanks for the offer, but I’m too private to post any stuff like that on imgur (I don’t even have Facebook) and reddit won’t let me send any screenshots/pictures in a DM. Many thanks again though."
hingeapp,exfn66e,t1_exfmv64,1566244206.0,"I haven’t thought of that. I just assumed that since there were so many profiles in the age range I set, the app is popular, but you’re right - it might not be the case at all. I live in Scotland and Tinder/Bumble seem to very popular over here, but since I’m looking for something more serious, I decided to give Hinge a try."
hingeapp,exfmt8s,t1_exfku9c,1566243985.0,"Thanks for your reply. I did see this link before and followed most of the suggestions. Yeah, I use the 10 likes per day and but not getting any matches from them, just a few men liking my profile. I only set my age (31-38) and distance preferences (up to 50 miles). I left everything else open. I’d happily share my profile with you in a private DM but apparently, I can’t send screenshots on Reddit."
hingeapp,exfmh5h,t1_exfkday,1566243772.0,"Similar age to mine, 31-38"
hingeapp,exfirf7,t1_exfh961,1566241459.0,"I don’t have any children, set my preferences to a narrow age range of around 31-38 (I think), so I only see profiles of people roughly the same age, I usually send likes only to people with the same religious/politics views (atheist/liberal), comment or ask a question when liking a picture/brief cue, but it didn’t seem to make any difference."
hingeapp,exfi1db,t1_exfg5lg,1566241002.0,Thanks for your reply. I’ll DM you a couple of screenshots so any feedback will be appreciated.
Anxiety,evp222v,t1_evoytyi,1564664257.0,"Have an updoot from me :) and totally agree, doesn’t make sense at all and yet, happens a lot on reddit"
Anxiety,evp1t20,t3_ckkt3b,1564664079.0,"Yes, totally. Redditors’ reactions can be so random and can be pretty hard to foresee. It’s certainly a strange place to share anything. I even shared sth on here the other day and it didn’t get any reaction at all, so I just deleted the post."
glee,evoxvnz,t3_cklunm,1564661157.0,"Florence and the Machine ‘Dog days are over’. I really don’t like Florence and the Machine as an artist, but absolutely love the Glee cover of this song."
Anxiety,evc10ze,t1_evbykd3,1564402931.0,"I guess the question would be where these feelings/emotions come from then in case where you know for sure that they are not other people’s emotional states. Maybe sometimes other people simply reflect to you what you deep down feel yourself, but aren’t ready to confront/process yet; hence the anxiety?"
Anxiety,evbn2uw,t3_cj5fn6,1564384418.0,"I can totally relate to what you’re describing and I would call myself an empath (or a highly sensitive person - two terms that pretty much mean the same). I used to wonder all the time why I would feel so much so often without realising that a lot of the feelings and emotions I would experience weren’t even mine. I now know that I often take on other people’s stuff. I can sometimes even feel a palpable vibe of a room I walk into and can pick up on the overall energy of people in it. Therapy helped me create better personal boundaries and being in the water (usually just through having a shower) helps cleanse other people’s energies off of me, so I can discern better between what is my stuff and what isn’t and this definitely helps reduce anxiety. In fact, I would say that I feel anxiety mostly when I can’t tell what I feel or am not ready to do so. Once I name my feelings (or discern what’s happening with somebody else’s), the anxiety goes away."
glee,eva91te,t3_cix4xf,1564341868.0,"I think it’s perfectly ok to share whatever opinions people have about the show on this sub. That’s what’s it’s here for after all. I don’t see anything wrong with expressing different ways in which we may perceive certain elements of the show and if somebody feels the need to ‘defend’ them, then it probably means they are taking things far too personally."
glee,ev6ci1l,t3_cijc17,1564245130.0,"Wait till you get to the seasons where she’s off to New York ;D She becomes pretty insufferable at times. I often skip forward her neverending solos apart from a couple of performances at NYADA which feels like a good fit for her theatrical singing manner.

EDIT: I often wonder why the screenwriters decided to centre a show around a character who can be so annoying."
glee,ev6bl8p,t1_ev5rew6,1564244847.0,"Yeah, I totally see your point, but from a screenwriting point of view, it just seemed unnecessary as though it wasn’t ok for her to just be on her own for a while, both to heal and to focus on other things in her life, especially given that Finn had such a big presence in her life in so many ways. It also felt pretty out of the blue, as I always saw Sam and Rachel as having more of a friends/relatives kind of a dynamic. Even seeing the two characters kissing just felt totally wrong and pretty awkward."
glee,ev6ahkr,t1_ev62p7x,1564244490.0,"Ha ha I think you have just summarised perfectly pretty much what I think about the incessant dating in the series. Interestingly, the Sue and Emma characters both commented on this at some point in the story.

I was also trying to remember the other day if there was anyone who Sam DIDN’T date in the Glee circle and I couldn’t think of anyone from the original cast apart Lauren Zizes."
