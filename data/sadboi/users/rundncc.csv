If you’re not hydrated your veins will be damn near impossible to fuck with or see. Pump the fist a little bit, with the hand below the waist.

I didn’t think he was with another girl necessarily. I just thought he went somewhere else, wherever that may be, and neglected to tell me. And not only that but I also worried something may have happened to him. Really all he had to do was be like “yo I’m just chillin in the car my bad”, he could’ve lmk traffic was bad if that was the reason, etc. I can admit I blew it up bigger than it was in my mind and in my comments. Knowing I’m being irrational doesn’t stop my mind from going to all those places. I’m not happy about it but I just need constant reassurance. Which I can understand how that can seem extreme from the outside looking in, but if I don’t have it I feel like I’m gonna spiral out from all the thoughts, the what if’s, the doubts.

So I call and I’m like wya and he said he was turning in the driveway. I found it odd that it didn’t sound like he was in a car in the background, but then I was like stop you’re being paranoid. 25 minutes after that he says he’s in the parking lot. Couple minutes later he finally walks in. I was like I’m no expert but i don’t think it takes 25 minutes to turn in the driveway to my apt parking lot, park the car, and come in. He said “my bad I was sitting in the car”. I’m like 95% sure I’m being lied to yet I’m still here thinking “damn hope this doesn’t end” bc I crave affection so fucking badly.
