mentalhealth,f6b8ryp,t1_f6azrv0,1572770238.0,"To be honest I actually prefer the internet to the real world. Why, because people are more honest here. I had a ton of fake friends I had to cut off, so my squad limited to a few friends and family. In my final year of university and still panic when I do assignments.  A lot of people gossiped about me because I school in a small town and still act nice when they around me, so I became a loner . To be honest am still searching for my best self(  FYI am in my final year of university 😭) The thing is we learn as we grow, so with time you will figure out yourself. If you need someone to talk to and help I can try😁. Let’s help each other grow because no one’s perfect 🙏. Just message me 🙏"
mentalhealth,f6b4hiu,t3_dqxbv4,1572768071.0,"Hey I hear everything your saying, let me tell you a funny story . My life has been shit for the past two years and family has been the only thing that kept me grounded. I lost a lot of friends because they never truly helped me in life , especially when I struggled(we just drank a lot which isn’t healthy). The thing with life is that there will always be mean people but as long as you got family around you can prevail. Please seek help from a professional, take care of your mental state, do things because they will create a better version of yourself, don’t be stressing about others because no matter what you do there will always be gossip. Remember YOU MATTER, YOUR HEALTH MATTERS. I BELIEVE YOU WILL DOMINATE SCHOOL SOON, just don’t give up and keep pushing ❤️🙏❤️. If you need someone to talk to you can message me. I promise not to judge and will keep it to myself. I have had my own share of gossip so I became a loner 😁. (I ❤️It ) 
Wishing you the best in life ❤️"

politics,f5tezod,t1_f5t27te,1572457145.0,True. As little ones we appreciate each other’s companionship no matter the gender or ethnicity. As we grow multiple influences affect how we perceive the world . Am black and have received my own share of racist comments but I always preach love. Hopefully the world will learn to love more than hate 🙏
