puppy101,f1km3b7,t1_f1jwr7q,1569537327.0,Wow! Thank you so much for your in depth response!!
puppy101,f1hkj66,t3_d9a03w,1569495423.0,"Thank you for your advice! We don’t have a Kong, but we are planning on buying it soon. I have definitely not given up, but my dad has :( he was never attached to the puppy from the beginning and regrets bringing him home. I know that he will be a good boy, he just needs some guidance and training from an expert. But then, my dad is not willing to send him because he thinks it’s too expensive. UGH. That’s why I’m looking for a job so I can pay for his training. 
Sorry for the rant"
puppy101,f1gxos7,t1_f1g5zlf,1569480677.0,"The thing is he bites my parents and sister when they’re in the kitchen. And whenever my mom is cooking, suddenly he starts to bite, so it becomes hard to walk away in the midst of cooking. They also redirect him to a toy, but he drops the toy and starts biting them again. We don’t know what to do anymore :/"
puppy101,f1ba2yh,t3_d8kgs6,1569328923.0,"My 4 month old golden barks non stop too! It’s very annoying and disturbing the peace in the house. He’s also biting a lot these days, more than normal. He already started his teething so it could be that. My dad’s getting extremely frustrated and is regretting his decision of getting a dog. My dad is not willing to send him to training because he thinks it’s too expensive, which is understandable because he is the only breadwinner, but I truly  believe my puppy needs training! I don’t want to lose him. What should I do?"

puppy101,eyzp69c,t1_eyzn1pm,1567622443.0,"Yes! My golden doesn’t stop digging and eating stones! And I live in Canada and it’s got colder here, so I’m trying to call him to come inside, but he just won’t listen! And it’s frustrating because I’m so cold and I’m not used to it (moved here around 3 years ago). He’s only allowed in one area of the house, which is the kitchen and a small space next to it and that was the worst decision ever! He’s such a BIG foodie that whenever my mom cooks, he’s always roaming around her, distracting her, and barking @ the door to play/ potty, which delays her schedule! He will not go to his crate and sleep until we’re out of the kitchen, which is very hard because my mom has a lot of chores. Lord help us all puppy parents!"

I’m going to uni soon (first year) and I’m SO nervous about making friends because I’m an introvert, I’m shy, AND I have anxiety; not the greatest trio.

puppy101,ewyower,t3_cqqlt9,1565884585.0,"I’m having a lot of difficulty too training my 9 week old golden retriever. We put in blankets in his crate, his toys, and treats, but he doesn’t seem to like it. When we take the blanket outside he loves it! When we lock the crate, he barks a lot and when he let him out, he starts scratching at the door and barking at it; he absolutely HATES the door! We’re trying our best, but this puppy is pretty stubborn."
puppy101,ewxqffd,t3_cqe9tq,1565865958.0,That’s amazing !!
puppy101,ewwj6jj,t1_ewwip32,1565829203.0,"Yes! We try to enforce naps but he never likes to leave our side. I just posted another post talking about this, but in short our puppy won’t leave our side when we’re in the kitchen with him and it is very frustrating because my mom has to cook and complete household chores. We have given him space in the kitchen because it works out for us and the puppy. We tried blocking the kitchen, but that would leave him very little space. We do crate training, but he doesn’t like going in his crate. We put his favourite  toys, treats, and praise him, but he just comes back right out. Any tips?"
