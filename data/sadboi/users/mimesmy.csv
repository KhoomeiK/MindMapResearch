AskReddit,f85uwx2,t1_f85u4np,1574283736.0,"I see a neurologist for the botox injections. She works with movement disorders, specifically Parkinson’s. That’s not what I have, but she definitely knows what she’s doing. She usually feels along my neck, shoulder, and upper back to determine which areas are the tightest and where to inject. The 2 times I’ve had botox now she chooses 4 points that are along my shoulder and closer to my neck.

The botox itself doesn’t hurt, just the little prick of the needle. Yesterday when I got the second dosage I could feel the botox inside me, it was pretty weird. It can make your body weak or make your neck feel like it’s throbbing but that goes away after a couple of days. Yes, before the very first injection I had a couple muscles in general that were so tight; my physical therapist and a chiropractor could basically do nothing to loosen it so the botox kind of saved me as it was the last resort."

My head was always tilted and people would ask me or people who knew me what was wrong. I don’t know if it’ll be permanent (hopefully not), but I got botox injections August 9 and only recently they’ve worn off. I tried medication, physical therapy, a cheap neck brace, and steroid shots but none of those worked. Botox did wonders for me. I was extremely anxious going into it but everyone commented on how much better my neck looked about a month later. Going back for more botox in a couple days and I’m still a bit nervous but I know it helps temporarily and alleviates the immense amount of pain I could be in."

After I got some awareness, I realized the trauma I had gone through and talked with my siblings about any events that negatively impacted my mental health. After my siblings reached 18, I was the only one required to visit her monthly. It got to the point where being around her caused me so much anxiety and dread. I was afraid to stay with her because I’ve read about schizophrenic mothers who killed their children and blamed it on the word of God, which she claimed told her to do many things. I’m sorry for your loss. I still have to remind myself I’m not to blame, her mind was plagued and I couldn’t help that, but I still feel awful for how I treated her sometimes."
SuicideBereavement,f7g8y4e,t3_duo8w0,1573697584.0,"A part of what tears me apart is that the last time I contacted my mom was almost 3 weeks before she took her life. My other siblings were more involved in her life and I often blame myself for being aloof and brushing her off sometimes. I have to remind myself that our personalities were very different, and not always in the way where opposites attract. Our love languages were different (mine quality time and words of affirmation and hers physical contact and gifting). Just because our brains were wired differently doesn’t mean I should unhealthily tear myself down. Guilt and regret is such a hard part of the grieving process."
SuicideBereavement,f7g8hob,t3_dusfld,1573697257.0,"I’ve been struggling a lot with this lately. Even small new things keep coming up. I have this condition that causes my neck to constrict and tense up, and my mom tried to help me with medicine I never took since I didn’t think it would help. Just 3 days after she took her life (August 6 she passed) I got botox injections in my neck that stopped the muscle from straining and felt she would’ve been overjoyed. I also focus on the times I wasn’t the best son and acted aloof and that makes me feel extremely guilty, but I also am aware that she had schizoaffective disorder which really damaged her mentality. Last year I saw some texts that she wanted to help pay for me to go to Europe with my school’s choir, and I felt sad because I knew she never had much money. This year I’m actually able to go on the trip with choir and I’m devastated that I couldn’t tell her. These things also make me question if I would’ve told her at all. We had a rough relationship due to her mental health issues and mine, so I was a bit withdrawn from her but I told her I loved her, would lay with her and play with her hair. Our relationship was confusing and strained at times but we both loved each other. Now I just wish more than anything she was with me right now because I would go the extra mile to make her feel loved. I’m so sorry for your loss."

When I woke up in the dream I remember being the first one to see her, just standing in the living room expecting us. I’m usually the first to wake up out of my siblings since I’m naturally an early riser, so the entire thing felt real. When I saw her alone though, there was kind of a pause. We both just looked at each other and I was confused, then suddenly all of my siblings were next to me and everyone was sobbing."
