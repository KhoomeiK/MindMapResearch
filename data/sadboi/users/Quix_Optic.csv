Ingredients


Crust
1 box Pillsbury™ refrigerated pie crusts, softened as directed on box


Filling



6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (6 medium) 


3/4 cup sugar


2 tablespoons all-purpose flour


3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon


1/4 teaspoon salt


1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg


1 tablespoon lemon juice



Put in oven at 450 for 40-45 min (mine was thin so I only did 35 min). 



After 15-20 minutes put some tin foil around the edges so they don't get too burnt. 


Let cool for about 2 hours (or be like me and be VERY late to where you need to be with this pie and just bring the extremely hot pie in the car with you.)."
