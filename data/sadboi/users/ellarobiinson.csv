I hope that soon you can move out and distance yourself from such a toxic cycle. remember that your mum loves you and hopefully isn't trying to cause you harm, just keep you safe. it that was my mum I would've stormed out ages ago, so kudos to you. stay strong!"

Advice,fbnf239,t3_edvolt,1576996764.0,"Keep an eye on your brother. Kids who are reckless from a young age tend to hone their unruly habits and make things worse as they grow up. Believe me, I (16 F) have a younger sister (12) whose favourite activity was and still is stealing from our family and verbally abusing us. The best thing to do, I think, is to keep a wary eye out on your brother but distance yourself. Tell your parents how you really feel. Make them aware of your struggle. Has your brother gone to behavioural therapy? I know he might seem a bit old for this but it's worth it, especially if your brother is going into middle school x"

blackmirror,eso2cd6,t3_c8lbe1,1562157900.0,"Creepy. Like *really creepy*. I watched it tonight with my family and there wasn't a single moment on the whole thing I wasn't on the edge of my seat. Something about it being black and white and the camera angles used and the no music background made it really unnerving. If you're into that, go ahead. I watched it a couple times over and couldn't find the moral message/warning for it other than the usual ""AI becomes deadly after too much fine-tuning"" but it does well by keeping you on your toes."
