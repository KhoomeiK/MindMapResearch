bipolar,fpeg47h,t3_gczvpq,1588546880.0,Since I don't know you fully its hard for me to tell and a therapist would have a better idea on that. If you are doing it for long periods of time and are obsessive over it then it sounds like it. My biggest suggestion is to see someone especially if you're not diagnosed because its possible there's more stuff going on than you may think and they can help you identify and work on those behaviors.
bipolar,fpefps5,t1_fpe4iw4,1588546668.0,Took the words right out of my mouth! Try writing every day but don't beat yourself up if you can only make it one sentence without giving up.
bipolar,fpeffus,t3_gcuk36,1588546515.0,I have definitely had melt downs because of this too. It made me think of my mom who has seizures and will have to take medication for the rest of her life. The progress that I've made in recovery over the past two years though has given me so much hope and am finally reaching my idea (instead of societies) of normal. Plus I found the absolute best therapist who has become a second mom to me and she also has a son who's bipolar and I enjoy talking to her every week so my breakdowns have become so much less frequent. The future is so scary for me too but I have being trying my hardest to focus on being healthy in each moment day by day and that has helped me too. Sending love your way.

bipolar,f286450,t3_dcb07s,1570053586.0,"My Mom was diagnosed with epilepsy right after pregnancy and gets auras often. When I got put on a mood stabilizer I found out it was also an anti seizure drug ( come to find out it affects the same part of the brain so they're pretty linked). I get them when I'm in the shower or in jacuzzis and Im pretty sure it has to do with a lack of oxygen in to the brain. Talk to a psych and a neurologist and check in with them frequently, good luck! :("
bipolar,f285q5k,t3_dcfgmx,1570053328.0,My dude knows I'm manic when I don't even bother to say hi to him when I get to his house and just strip lol.
bipolar,f285lg4,t3_dcakxn,1570053242.0,"Hey dude! Im at a university and i have accommodations. I would talk to your psychologist about what your main symptoms are that affect your learning. Personally I have bad attention span issues and i work on bipolar time so my time management skills aren't the best. For me I asked my therapist if she could recommend 

1. Note taking- I study better if I already have the notes and just have to pay attention
2. The ability to leave class a few times- usually you get sat by the door I have really bad anxiety so if i get overwhelmed i go outside to get air
3.  explain that sometimes your symptoms are so bad that you can't get to school and they can send you the power point if it isn't posted
4. I get extra time on homework and tests if i need to which is really helpful
5. I have the option to take tests not in the classroom and in office hours or in the disability center which helps with my test anxiety (I get freaked out by the sound of turning pages and pen sounds)

Keep in mind you need to be completely honest with your professors, some will understand better than others but just know they are required to give you those accommodations in accordance with the law. 

Steps to getting accommodations:

1. go to your disability center and ask to register with them
   1. Ask them what information they need from your doctors, its usually a form/ letter that your psych writes for you
2. You schedule a meeting with a counselor and they go through your letter and diagnoses and your weaknesses and needs as a student
   1. be completely honest and if you aren't doing well tell them, they are trained to help you
3. Get a finalized plan from your counselor
4. Take the plan/ from the counseling center and take it to your professors 
5. have a conversation and be honest ( if they mistreat you in anyway you can complain to the disability center bc technically it's considered discrimination) 

Don't feel bad asking for help or being ashamed of it, you have to swallow your pride a little bit bc the normal system is rigged against people who struggle with the things we do so take advantage of EVERY SINGLE option you have. Hope this helps comment on this if you have questions about the process I went through! :)"
bipolar,f1nkcfr,t3_d9vp2e,1569619217.0,"I have so many hilarious manic situations, like literally everyday. Yesterday I was on my way to a DBSA meeting (bi polar support group highly recommend). I was super manic so I was driving super fast in traffic on PCH and was stressed out because I had never been to this location before. I had two minutes to get into the meeting and I was still trying to find parking in the structure. I park, have one minute left and figure out that the walk to the hospital is another 3 minutes down this long ramp. SO I decide to jump the fence (great decision I know) and run down the hill between a couple of bushes. I jump and start running down the hill and the bushes were a lot thicker than I thought so I tripped and went face first down the hill and ROLLED in front of a Tesla waiting at the emergency room entrance. I was so embarrassed I full sprinted into the hospital entrance to see the two people at the front desk laughing bc I had mud on my pants and twigs in my hair. My manic decision making is awesome right."
bipolar,f1ltk31,t3_d9oic2,1569568208.0,"Funny you post this. I have Bipolar 1 and I drank coffee at 9:30 this morning and it's currently midnight and i'm still wired. I am not excited for tomorrow since i'll be falling asleep/ crying on my come down. For me coffee is like a drug, if you are medicated as well you are way more sensitive to caffeine."
BipolarReddit,f1692bm,t3_cvhqxk,1569205705.0,WOW. I have been thinking this for so long. I have had this theory that my school nurse prescribed me a high dose antidepressant that may have triggered something that was dormant in my brain. I thought this was maybe a delusion brought on by psychosis which I have also just been diagnosed with. Thank you for sharing because I though t I was totally alone in this.
bipolar,f167q83,t3_d7v8p9,1569204673.0,"I've been on a 250 mg dose of lamictal in addition to a 5mg zyprexa for anxiety for about a year and a half now. I'm newly 21 and i've had problems with mania since I was really young. Everyone thought I was a really weird kid, but turns out there was something behind it all this time. I'v noticed that my cycling has declined a lot on this combination. I started taking both medications at night since the Zyprexa knocked me out, but I felt like a zombie waking up in the morning but just recently switched my lamictal to the morning and zyprexa at night which I think has contributed a lot in this past couple of weeks. I just recently lost a really good relationship that I thought was going to last because I couldn't control or explain my manic episodes and manic anger. This illness is really scary but there's a few really good videos on youtube that helped me understand how others can help me through this while also being accountable myself. I would suggest watching these when you feel neutral because I watched these when I was crashing and i've been crying for an hour.
