—My sophomore year a student hung himself on the playground across the street and his story was later turned into a rock opera. The next year a student jumped off of the town water tower, also across the street. He survived. 
—We had a group of students calling themselves the “[Town Name] Mafia that would go to local grocery/convenience stores and cause general havoc.
—Once a fight broke out in the hallway and the closest teacher locked his classroom door instead of intervening. The video ended up on WorldStar.
—After I graduated kids starting doing hard drugs like cocaine and ecstasy in the bathrooms. Once an ambulance had to be called on a girl who OD’d. I believe they have teachers on bathroom duty now. 
—Students in my grade had a rock band and one day we had an assembly where they just put on a concert and we all moshed in the area between the stage and first row of seats in the auditorium. 
—A student was caught with a ridiculous amount of edibles on his person but a gym teacher tackled him to the ground in the parking lot so he got off scot-free. 
—Two students got in a heated twitter debate after one of them made fun of an assembly where disabled teens and adults performed. The other guy said take it back or else. He didn’t take it back, so this dude shows up in the asshole’s homeroom and starts choking him out until someone pulls him off. He was suspended for 2 weeks but he was dubbed the “[Town Name] Punisher” and celebrated for kicking ass.

There are usually multiple households in one save file and I create in-depth relationships between all of the sims. I also have been trying to learn the lore behind it which is really interesting. There’s so many challenges ans mods you can do/download for free and I also like to invest in the expansion packs when they go on sale.

EDAnonymous,ffvt5i8,t3_evahiz,1580272513.0,"I’m OBSESSED with my HR (actually kind of obsessed as it stems from my OCD) ever since I got my FitBit. My ED caused me to get orthostatic hypotension though, which means that when I go from lying to sitting or sitting to standing my blood pressure plummets and my heart rate increases to compensate. My RHR is usually averaging 60 but I’m overweight - it’s dropped dramatically since I became orthostatic. I know when I’m laying down/at night it’s gotten as low as 48 bpm because I’ve checked in my fitbit app. And tbh if my psych knew this she’d probably want to send me back into treatment! 

Also, side note, idk if anyone here is on beta blockers (like Prazosin) for PTSD but if you have a low BP those meds drop it way lower. I was blacking out every morning before we realized why!"

I knew my weight before I went in and weighed myself about a week after I left and I’d only gained about 2 pounds! Looking at that over a span of 6 weeks with the lack of exercise (before I was compulsively exercising multiple times a day), plus the calorie surplus - you should totally be fine at your height maintaining at 1200!

Watsky,f62kokj,t3_dq4tjd,1572661524.0,"Watsky pulled it from Spotify recently (not sure why) so if it is off Amazon too it could be because there’s 1) issues with the rights or 2) possibly a re-release coming out soon? If he hasn’t addressed it on social media, I’d suspect the later of the two. I hope that is the case for you and your friend as that would be awesome!!

EDIT:: It was the digital platformer that was down and Cardboard Castles has been restored to Spotify/Amazon/Apple Music. I scoured the web but it seems like it’s not available even on third party websites - I’m guessing because Watsky only sold the CD on his website since he was pretty independent at the time of its release? Since your friend still has the case, could you burn her a copy? Is that a thing people still do/can do? Lol."

Books are great! Make sure they are “appropriate” aka not sad, or she won’t be able to have them. I read a lot of fantasy books in the hospital. A pretty journal is really nice to have, since they tend to just give you a plain composition book and it encourages journaling after discharge. I saw other people recommend coloring books with positive sayings and origami - absolutely! and any comfy clothes without strings - a sweatshirt, pj pants, comfy socks, slippers. You basically live in pajamas so it’s nice to be comfy. You can also see if there’s any kind of treat she’s allowed to have. At the unit I was on we were allowed to have Lifesavers (lol).

I went thru all the neurological tests and was diagnosed with Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures, and PTSD a few days after. It’s a way that your body processes trauma, in a such an extreme dissociative way that it mimics a seizure. Usually you are conscious but non-responsive (which is different from epilepsy where you are unconscious during seizures). 

The only way to “cure” these episodes is trauma therapy. Unfortunately for me they unearthed a lot of repressed trauma and have set forth a lot of PTSD symptoms. Definitely talk to your psychiatrist/therapist. Even though they don’t show up on EEGs/MRIs they are very real. Best of luck :)"

Not sure if this is the PTSD, blunt effect of schizoaffective disorder, or general depression right now because I’m really just now starting to process 2 decades of trauma, but I have no emotion right now but anger, anxiety, and sadness.
