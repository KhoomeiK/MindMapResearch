I can only give you my two cents as a guy online as I'm no expert, but as you age, you'll want to do different things. I recommend you to study about **stoicism.** You'll find your happiness along the way. In the myth of Sisyphus, he's condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain, and see the boulder roll down every time he's close to the top. He's condemned to do so for all eternity. Happiness is not being able to reach the top, happiness is in the journeys up the mountain. In other words: happiness is **never** a destination, happiness is **the journey**. Keep doing what you love, work on objectives, take care of your family, learn new skills, gain knowledge, build a business, watch your kids grow old. The journey is different for everyone, and happiness is not something you or anyone can reach if you keep trying, it's something that comes naturally when doing what you want and what you love.

Achieving milestones and objectives in life, creating new ones.. working towards them is happiness. You'll be unhappy when you stop having objectives.

Drugs is easy: Bad trips with acid/shrooms/dmt (never really had bad trips with shrooms alone though). Others you just feel like you're going to die and you firmly believe you shouldn't have done it, and then there's slavia where you feel you came back from hell: did it only 2 times, the first was alright and mild, the second was a strong extract and it felt like I had no control at all and can't really get my head around the experience even today, was scary and felt like it was just wrong idk.. Compared to things like DMT i'd say DMT is it's whole other type of trip and can be extremely enlightening. Acid I've had more bad trips than good trips and personally avoid it (it's fun and probably not worth doing alone inna woods, more like festivals with friends). Shrooms the only thing I can say you probably won't have bad trips, but to each their own. Only bad experience was when I took them after a day of mdma, alcohol and a bad sleep, felt like total shit.

Crazy people include lots of different situations, most of them related to almost dying. Won't go into specifics here, sorry. Don't trust people you don't know for years already, you'll never know. You can be on a new place trying to find stuff or just trying to have a good time and even when it feels safe you can get stabbed or threatened with firearms for money and what not. Met people from different backgrounds and where I'm from, things are generally safer than most other countries. Some cases I remember: 'Known' old man in a town tried to stab a girl within our group of friends and when he couldn't he went back and stabbed his own dog, killing it on the spot, saw it happen, the dog was probably his for a year or more already (happened after an altercation of sorts). Gipsies where I'm from are 'dangerous', they have their small communities (micro enclave type areas) and I've been robbed with a gun pointed at me (head/face/looking away from it) for just my money (didn't want my phone) and went on like it was nothing and other gipsies around didn't give a shit like it was a regular day, even kids (12-15) carry pistols and knives and try to mug you or sell you watches, perfumes and that type of stuff (not drugs). They also kill each other like gangs in America but police does nothing, one of my best friends was at home (flat for special needs families or whatever) and they just went on a shootout on the stairways of the building, police never came and he had to wait it off, nothing was done about it and there's still damage from the gunshots. These are isolated cases and the one's I remember the most, other stuff includes festivals and staying around Europe, meeting all kinds of insane.
