I often will leave a room to avoid feeling obligated, or even called on, to do something about it. This urge to ""fix"" is the strongest with my partner.

Pandemic related trauma + other Trauma(s) = Possible CPTSD

&#x200B;

Complex PTSD usually refers to repeated exposure or continual exposure to trauma(s) for a long period of time.

Though CPTSD usually occurs as a result of childhood trauma, often abuse and neglect, it is not exclusive to that

From a treatment approach perspective, typically with PTSD the specific traumatic event is the focus, and touching on other areas.

With CPTSD there is a *guaranteed* need to do a lot of unraveling of how the way you coped with one trauma changed you and how that has informed the way you responded to this new trauma

&#x200B;

As for the things in the pandemic that can be traumatic:

You should really dissect what you've said there. 

\-You feel guilty because you don't know a lot of times if you do this because you actually 'care' about people... Which is to say you feel guilty because you don't care. If that is the care (you not caring) that is something totally valid to feel guilty about.

\-You feel guilty because... part of you just wants to feel safe. You should not feel guilty about that. 

That being said, both of these things can be true at the same time. But the second one is likely ALWAYS true.

It is okay to not care for/about everyone.  It is okay for you to want to feel safe.

Ingredients

* 4 chicken thigh and leg quarters Or 1 whole chicken cut into 8 pieces
   * Salt generously

&#x200B;

* Dredge:
   * 3 cups (450g) flour
   * 3 teaspoons (10g) kosher salt

Whisk theses together, set aside

* Buttermilk Dip:
   * 2 large eggs
   * 2 cups (475ml) buttermilk
   * 2 tablespoons (30ml) hot sauce
   * 2 tablespoons (30ml) pickle juice
   * Splash of cold smoked matsutake shoyu for fancy  (optional)

Start with the buttermilk, whisk in other ingredients individually. Set aside.

&#x200B;

* Hot Oil Spices:
   * 1 cup (240ml) hot oil
   * 4 tablespoons (25g) cayenne   (8/10 on the spicy scale)
   * 1 tablespoon (11g) garlic powder
   * 1tbsp (8g) smoked paprika
   * 2 teaspoons (6g) kosher salt
   * 2 tablespoons (25g) dark brown sugar

Whisk together (in a bowl that can tolerate heat) until thoroughly combined.... set aside

He talked quite a bit at the start of the vid, he starts cooking after the 4 minute mark

Preheat fry oil to 325F/160C

Take a piece of chicken, completely cover it in flour (dredge), then dunk it in the buttermilk, then back in the dredge. set it aside. Grab the next piece and dredge, dunk, dredge

Fry the pieces in batches, don't over crowd the pot. cook for 15-18 minutes or until the chicken has an internal temp of  165F. Sit them on a wire rack to drain

When all your chicken is done, take a cup of the hot oil you just cooked in and put in in the spice bowl and mixx it up. Dunk in the chicken or brush on the oil.

Done."

JUSTNOFAMILY,flg9h9n,t1_flg212k,1585135931.0,"> owe it to our SO's

I was about to start an anrugment until I read this. I have been very close to breaking up with someone because their family being an issue turned into them being an issue. We lived with ""The-In-Laws"" for about a year and a half. It started out as a fantastic way to save a ton of money and pay off my student loans quickly while SO recovered from a sudden job loss. 

  
But there were occasionally tensions and some household-cultural disparities that made us butt heads... particularly with the dad. Those disagreements were always met with SO saying ""I'm sorry you feel this way, but Dad is just..."" and proceeds to defend everything without truly hearing my side. And, though I loved/love the mom, she can be emotionally intense... and in those situations, I like to make an exit if there isn't an issue with me (ie I didn't cause or wasn't a part of her upset). SO felt that my leaving was rude, and wanted me to hang around, or would sometimes call me into the situation.   


We didn't really recover from what that did to me and our relationship until 2 years after moving out. We were **still** having arguments about interactions that occured with with their parents... SO realized they spent (and still spends) too much time managing and protecting their parents' emotions and ego, and in turn completely neglected me during our stay.

   
Thankfully I had their siblings to vent to... they understood the whole time"

CPTSD,fl9phcw,t1_fktzand,1584965341.0,"Shit eye contact: not because I'm less engaged in the conversation, but because eye contact feels confrontational and I feel an intense need to escape when I try to force myself to make eye contact. I'd sometimes also just up and walk away while someone was speaking to me- Not cuz I didn't understand social cues, but because I REALLY needed to get away, and that desire mattered more than not seeming rude.  


Very dry monotone speech: not because was unable to produce inflections of speech or didn't understand the importance of tone when delivering a message but because I frequently emotionally dissociated.  


Distracted/day dreaming at school... well I was distracted. Just not day-dreaming though. I was  day-maring. The emergance of flashbacks. But I was also emotionally dissociative... so When I snapped out of it, it was not apparent that I was lost in a Hellish landscape and not frolicking in a field of daisies.  


Not engaging with my peers, and socially withdrawn. Because Mmm-mm good ol' isolation. Also people, including your tiny friends, can hurt you  


I had ticks sort of where I'd repeat what I'd just said, sometime rephrasing it ""better"", and re-say it a couple times. I'd get trapped in a loop inside my head Trying to perfect what I should have said... That's thanks to my mom. I'll maybe share that story in another comment because it could get lengthy, but the short of it: gotta appear normal, but because we aren't.... we tend to over compensate which manifest in the form of Perfectionism.  
ha! i'd even correct people as they were speaking and get hung up over semantics. I was overly engaged in the conversation and started projecting my perfectionism. ""This is my peer, they must do better. I know they are better than this. Let me fix them. We can't have misunderstandings over simple careless mistakes.""  


There are others but I'll stop there

The craziest part of all this is that my symptoms didn't appear until after I was 9, and the bulk of them didn't show up til I was 12/13. Age 9 was the height of my trauma exposure. prior to that, I was a Very social child, emotionally expressive."

I began seeing improvements after 6months on maintenance dose. Stopped having my mild asthma symptom (mild:never had an ""attack"", chest would just feel itchy and a dry cough during evergreen mating season) after 2 years.  


I can now not take allergy meds for 5-9 days before seeing symptoms. And even then, it's just sneezing and slightly itchy eyes-- a dramatic improvement from taking Montelukast everyday and Claritin every 20 hours so there would be a good overlap, and still having slightly itchy eye, and a sneeze and itchy throat/soft palate would sneak in here or there"
