You're not alone. I know it looks like so many people have their shit together via zoom lectures and stuff but ... I don't buy it. Hang in there.

My credit score did drop in general because of my utilization rate in the past few months though because of some hardship. But have been on top of payments. But thanks! I'll give a call and try to prove how I've been affected and all."

CRedit,fcoo99k,t1_fconuwf,1577837222.0,If it's because of this and not late payment/judgments ... does that mean it would also recover faster than those other factors? Because I have heard people try to fix their credit for YEARS after judgements and late payments and such.

Yes, horrendous consequences that Europe would try to recover from for decades but it was pretty much the end of that threat during the end of World War II, ( I think excluding Spain?)

AskHistorians,f0ntw96,t3_d5inj0,1568780656.0,"Germany was aware of the civil war but probably not aware of the stage of it, as Mexico was in the final phase even though there was 3 more years to go. I believe Germany went ahead with the Zimmermann Telegram because at the head of Germany's ideal of national success was gaining territory, as it was an Empire at the time.  Germany probably put itself in Mexico's shoes, as they probably would have prioritized adding to their empire over internal conflict."

ADHD,etn3p43,t3_cch327,1562975857.0,"I'm sorry to hear about that. I am 22 years old female uni student too and I suffer from adhd and depression; I know how it's so hard to get the smallest things done, as both of these disorders feed into each other. Have you voiced your concern about ADHD with your psychiatrist? Or did you kind of hint at it hoping he would write something himself? When I first started my treatment for depression, it was still hard to focus on school work. I told my doctor that I think I may have ADHD and expressed how lack of focus is causing me to do bad in school which just feeds my depression. He asked what I'd like and I flat out said I would like to try out a stimulate (ritalin) and my life and focus and depression have improved so much! So maybe be more direct with your doctor? After-all, they're not mind readers. And if you've tried it and that did not work,I don't know how things work in Italy, but if things are like how it is in the U.S.A, I would recommend you see your primary doctor and see what could be done; maybe they would be able to write you something. And don't worry about seeking out a different psychiatrist in the long wrong. You're paying for their service and if you still feel like you're not getting the treatment you need - ditch them! I wish you luck ... I know how dark it could feel to suffer all this, especially at a time where concentration literally shapes your whole success in academics. Don't feel like a disappointment - you're not alone and did not chose to be like this. You'll figure it out - just be straightforward with whoever you need help from."

It was about a 12 hour day for me and the only productive thing that came out of it was signing up for Fall classes. Plus, the girl who was in charge of my group was not even informed herself about which classes I should and should not take. I registered for the wrong classes because of her help .. lol fail. And I think they charge about $170 on the BruinBill ... so yeah. If I could go back, I would not go. Yet some people probably liked it because it's probably your first ""college experience"" and you get a bit familiar with the campus and stuff so it's alright. Anyways, welcome! GO BRUINS."
ucla,er7bfui,t3_c0pm9u,1560573556.0,"Sorry to hear you had a couple rough quarters,

You should not be dismissed. From what I believe, will be dismissed if you were put on probation already and failed to meet the probation terms the following quarter. Don't stress about being dismissed. Go see an academic counselor for reassurance. Take care, hopefully we all have a better year in Fall. :)"
ucla,er0axpw,t3_bzlja0,1560413713.0,"Hi,

I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling. I was in a similar position this school year too. Because of my mental health, I was not able to do my best here at UCLA. I also waited really long to deal with it because well, it happens. If you have not taken the final yet and if the quarter has ended, you can retroactively withdraw. I did just that and then I took this spring quarter off to give myself some time off and get the help I need and I'm feeling so much better. I've been getting treatment too and now I look back and get believe I felt like I was in such a dark place just a couple months ago. It's going to be okay! Forgive yourself. We all have our ups and downs in life. You were top of your class in  high school! You hit a bit of a wall right now. But you will break down the wall down and be on top again in no time. Just forgive yourself first. Get the treatment you need. And things will fall back into place in no time.   
Good luck fellow bruin :)"
