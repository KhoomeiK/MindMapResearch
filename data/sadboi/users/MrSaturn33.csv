Chris said something bad, seriously bad, that I can never look past. [Here's a screenshot of it.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vDTy5CUBvXI/U1SRGNN47aI/AAAAAAAAAMg/YkMDvJXGVqA/s1600/Irate_Gamer_-_JewWario_Respect.jpg)

This proves he's a bad guy. **Insinuating that someone who was in enough pain to commit suicide will go to hell because they did.** Fuck anyone who thinks or talks like that. Especially when it's public on the internet and about someone who had an internet presence and a lot of fans online, not to mention and friends and family, that were grieving since it had just happened at the time Chris wrote that.

And I know that some great filmmakers who started independent have strong work they made from the ages of 17 - 22 or so.

But the angle you come from doesn't really add up. He's using colloquial language to say that some people notice the change in quality of the series more than others, and it's the ones that do that end up here. That's what he means when he says ""everyone who isn't braindead can see how bad the channel has become."" Respecting or not respecting the people who like the new episodes doesn't really have much to do with it. I honestly doubt he looks down on them or has feelings of resentment toward them.

Perhaps people have been saying the episodes have sucked for the last year because they suck. It's fine if you disagree, and technically this is of course the subjective take of the people in question who make said statements. But you have to at least admit that in style and tone they have been consistent--therefore, if the kind of person who wouldn't like them didn't at the beginning of the year, they haven't changed such that they should feel any differently now. Which is obviously going to be reflected as consistent statements.

I don't have an issue with the fact that you come here and give rebuttals and offer another perspective, that frankly this subreddit could use more of to counter the possibility of clouded judgement or blind negativity.

And second of all, I'm being told this when I haven't done anything in the first place. The reason I sent the appeal was just hoping that someone would actually read it and show me the comment, the automated message defeated the point of that.

You could say I'm taking automated responses too personally, but it really sucks how they assume I'm in the wrong because one person reported one comment that one admin decided was enough to warrant an account suspension.

And when there are cases associated with the entertainment industry, there's a tendency to focus on cases that relate to the industry on an institutional level, that is to say people in important positions in production companies, directors, actors, or people otherwise abusing their roles for a case of abuse or assault. This is to be expected, and while it does accomplish pointing out the intrinsic corruption in these operations it also can sweep aside how immediate cases can be.

A perfect example for the clear disconnect and lack of communication with everything, something that could have never happened back when it was James and Mike figuring out the games, the scriptwriting, the gameplay footage and the editing together.

Not that those episodes are perfect or I'm coming from a place of being bitter that things aren't like the ""good old days.""

TheCinemassacreTruth,fr0z5ge,t1_fqnlekz,1589810026.0,"I agree that it was better that he said nothing than getting involved in the drama. That's never been his thing. But he could have made a statement on Twitter clarifying a couple things, and *then* moved on. That might have been helpful.

A rebuttal to this is that the dreadful people on Twitter that were accusing him of misogyny were not going to be the type to listen to reason to begin with. It's a fair point. Sadly, real misogynists did chime into the debate as well, which unfortunately made the people falsely accusing James of misogyny feel they had more credence to their approach.

Before I move on, I completely liked his video from the start, and wasn't even aware of the drama for years since I don't go on Twitter or follow new movies. When I first heard that people were accusing him of sexism for this video, I found that really sad, mostly because it's so clear from the video itself that this wasn't the case. Because fuck Hollywood's generic corporate-produced unfunny cringey trash. Especially when it's shitting all over such a beloved franchise, when movies used to be good. *And* because there was a legitimate follow-up that was in the works for *years* that would have featured the original cast that almost got made several times until it never did. Not to mention the fact that the new movie is just called ""Ghostbusters"" meaning the original's title can't even be left alone.

That video was years in the making and it's truly something how many people didn't get it. Because they didn't want to get it, they wanted to assume he was ""one of them.""

I don't think James didn't say anything because he had full knowledge of the situation, and if he did, he might have felt more obliged to. Bear in mind I completely disagree with the conclusion of [this article](https://kotaku.com/the-complicated-legacy-of-the-original-angry-video-game-1783119418) that James has gradually become ""self-fulfilling satire"" for depicting a ""suburban white nerd with anger issues.""

&#x200B;

>It’s an incident that speaks to the other, more negative side to the Nerd’s influence. Following the Nerd, there is now a sect of voices on YouTube whose platform is entirely based around angrily criticizing what they view as “social justice”-infected media, often decrying when creators try to increase diversity, if not openly standing against critics using a feminist or other political lens. James’ video isn’t as antagonistic as some of the other stuff out there, but the video appeared during a wider conversation surrounding *Ghostbusters 3*, some of which was definitely steeped in sexism.  
>  
>James’ video landed him right in the middle of that discussion, despite it not really being about the new cast at all.

Simply put, his video was being taken out of context for people on social media who genuinely have antagonism and disdain for the fact that Hollywood and movie-making is become more diverse for featuring women and POC more increasingly as actors and other roles in the film-making process. Short clips of it were being shared by such people, to the point that many of the feminists on Twitter that were accusing the video of being sexist actually were unaware of what the video was. Again, the context that James had been aware and informing people about the many cancellations of Ghostbusters 3, and how he just wanted to see a re-uniting of the cast one last time, was necessary for that. Of course he explains this in the video, and nothing was stopping them from watching the real thing.

But since James and Mike had AlphaOmegaSin on the show (a proud self-proclaimed ""SJW-basher"" and all around just a real sad douche-bag) the whole thing stops sitting well with me. I don't think it would have been hard for James to clarify that he had no problem with the fact that the cast was women, and that the people who do have a problem with it aren't on the wrong side of things. That it's valid to dislike any movie regardless of this fact, and on the other hand people shouldn't jump to conclusions and assume prejudice where there isn't any.

I think there was a great opportunity for a statement that would have helped both sides realize something, and to my knowledge more than any other film critics his voice would have had a platform on Twitter for that statement, just in a sentence or two, to be told.

I agree with you that it's commendable that he stays out of drama, but I also think he could have continued to do so and still said something really helpful, and the fact that he didn't could either be an indicator (coupled with the fact that he featured AlphaOmegaSin on his channel) that he's more on the side of reactionary anti-feminists that don't like the fact that the industry is going in a more inclusive direction than not, he's out of the loop, just doesn't care, is lazy, or some combination of the above."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fr0xnv4,t1_fqnjivo,1589809118.0,">Who knows. The fact a bunch of losergators took that video to mean he was on their side and he refused to clarify things only worsened things out. At worst it meant he was ok with being associated with losergators, but more likely it was just another sign of how he's bad at handling the backfire like when his movie bombed or when his long-time friends ditched him.

This. He really should have said something.

The thing is, there was a lot of context in this video be posted. It sounds like I'm defending James's narrow-minded view that people cared, but at the very least it was a view he had communicated in many videos in the past. He did a Ghostbusters 3 video shortly after this, but many times through video and text James had informed people about the development-hell production of Ghostbusters 3, the amount of scripts it went through, the producers it went through, the many times it almost got made and got cancelled again.

I think we can all agree that James was bummed out about the movie because it didn't feature the original cast, and didn't have the endorsement of any of the original screenwriters, directors or producers of the first two films. (to my knowledge) Which in and of itself is not a problem. But it is the reason the movie is a soulless, factory-churned empty shell of a Hollywood movie. That much is clear from watching a trailer of it for 5 seconds. 

It had *nothing* to do with the fact that the cast was all females. The people on Twitter that blew up on him over this give feminism a bad name. The type that look for sexism when there isn't any. It wasn't the issue, simple as that. This video would have been identical if the cast was all males. It would have been different if even one of the original cast members was in the film, he might've not made the video at all in that case."

[As I posted merely hours ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCinemassacreTruth/comments/gjedxk/kieran_and_i_having_a_civil_discussion_on_twitter/) he sent a lot of Twitter DM messages to me and blocked me after I sent him a long message that can best be summarized as, ""hey, I just wanted to civilly say that I know you get harassed on your streams and that it must suck, but I've seen in clips the way you talk and wish violence on people and it bums me out as a long-standing fan of Cinemassacre to see anyone associated say such things since James never would. It also hurts you and you're giving the trolls what they want.""

In all fairness, I got a little idealistic and thought there was a chance it might lead to some productive discussion. That was my intention all along and why I posted screenshots in this subreddit. He told me that he's gotten many messages like mine recently, and in his view we think we're being fair and understanding but don't understand his ""side.""

I should also go on record that in spite of the fact that I spent *way* too much time in this, I have no investment. I'm a bit bummed that Cinemassacre is dead and James works with freaks who say awful sketchy crap. But that's the extent of my emotional investment and by now I've moved on from that, too.I don't lose sleep over it, I'm awake at night these days anyway. 

I saw an opportunity to say something and took it, since I knew he'd reply. And again my intentions were really just to see if he could understand why the behavior was shitty, simple as that. If to nobody else, himself. How much happier *everyone* would be if he cut out the sick talk.  But if he was going to why would he ever be the kind of person to go the places he's gone to begin with? Trying to reason with crazy people is crazy, as it turns out.

The beginning of his first reply actually said that he read all of my paragraphs and thanked me for taking the time to write it and being civil. But that, of course, I didn't know the ""whole story"" and his ""side"" and was ""automatically assuming he was wrong.""

Which is too absurd. Being ""right"" and ""wrong?"" That's completely beside the point. Nothing could have warranted the way he was talking in the recordings, and more relevantly to him he's just looking bad and increasing the chances he'll get trolled more in the future by giving them what they want. When he was banning the guy in the incident I mentioned in my second message he said he ""hoped he would die"" repeatedly as he clicked around on Twitch to ban him...why not just laugh it off, ban him and move on? He'd probably see a lot less trolls that way too.

My first message focused on the remarks he made about you, while the second message focused on a stranger that commented on his twitch that he made even worse statements about. ""I hope you get stabbed, shot, and your house burns down.""

I asked him that if he had moved on and would no longer ever see you or talk to you anymore, then why talk that way? And that not everyone on this subreddit are a bunch of hateful, seething psychos that live to see your pain, but on the contrary it's filled with individuals who have genuine concerns over the direction of Cinemassacre and wouldn't blame that over one person and one thing they said but understand how actions reflect on the whole.

After all was said and done he saw that I was posting screenshots of the DMs here, (whoops, I underestimated just how much he visits here ;o) fumed up and blocked me. Then, I realized something.

I realized just how crazy he really is. I always knew this of course, but not until all of this am I understanding fully just how simple it is and just how much his suffering is his own creation. In the messages he said that he's been dealing with constant harassment on a daily basis for over 2 years...I thought about it for two seconds and realized just how ridiculous this is.

On Twitch you can block users and kick them out of your streams. No matter how many people come in or how many new accounts they make, this can be done in a matter of clicks. As you aptly say his logic is fundamentally flawed and how popular could these streams be for either genuine fans or ""haters?"" As I've said before he feeds off the negative attention and seeks it out but now I see how miserable and angry he is when there was absolutely never anything in the way of him ignoring all this nonsense from a few people.

He's his own worst enemy and a perfect example of what a conflated ego, a delusional sense of reality, severe trauma and emotional/anger issues can do to somebody. But he doesn't strike me as the dumbest, craziest, meanest bully or anything either. He's just a little twisted in the head, has a lot of anger undealt with, and is a little sick. It's all sad."

TheCinemassacreTruth,fqlyei1,t1_fqluotn,1589468323.0,"Good analogy.

One important aspect of all of this is that you really have to put yourself in the mindset of James, Mike, and Ryan in terms of what they'd never outwardly communicate it. As time moves on this mindset becomes more and more overt though, particularly in the new thumbnails.

It's a mindset that every Youtube content creator has to worry about to an extent. But when the content no longer has anything going for it which is the case here this mindset starts to become more and more obnoxious and it's clear that the content creators concerned with it have lost all interest in...well, making content and the mindset ironically consumes everything.

Call it the ""numbers mindset.""

Youtube pushes up channels that have more subscriptions and whose videos have more views and have been shared more times. Additionally, and notably, it also gives credence to channels that upload on a regular basis. To say nothing of the fact that more money means more videos, they're also clearly terrified of having an even brief window of time with no content. This informs the way they plan ahead new video uploads and how they sit on videos, scheduling uploads in advance, and having a backlog that they space out and selectively upload videos at certain times.

Hence why there's just so much filler, everyone jokes that James is bored and half-asleep during Rental Reviews and James & Mike here but it couldn't be more true. Everyone knows that people come to see James but it's just the idea he's showing up and present that matters. He's completely moved on. But if he stands or sits in front of the camera for however long, he can say that he regularly uploads new videos that feature him, no matter how much that is purely the case on a technical level.

It's a bit hard to explain outside of specific examples but it's all that's on their minds *constantly.* The views. Keeping up. The algorithm. Keeping up. The search results. The ads. Think about how many successful channels never sold out to the extent that they do with the paid promotions and still make plenty of money. It isn't about the extra money they can squeeze out of every video, it's just a consequence of the show becoming demoralized. In the long wrong it will hurt them because even the fan boys, the normies and the kids will sooner or later get bored of it."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fqlu2u2,t1_fqlqosd,1589466085.0,"I don't doubt that. I think video games are something he doesn't get much from and personally I'm right there with him. To me, video games are like this outlet that gives people something to do, and no matter how good the graphics get or how deep, large and complex they become they still seem to primarily offer this service of giving people goals and tasks.  At the moment I've been trying to get around to some classics I never beat because a few games, particularly ones in genres that allow for narrative or time for aesthetic richness, really have a lot of heart and soul put into them such as Chrono Trigger, Silent Hill 2 and Shenmue.

When I was younger and less interested in life and the world I was bored all the time and so I lived for them but now for the most part it's hard to imagine them by and large really being that interesting. I don't feel better than people who are really into them (and often in similar contexts these words come off as pretentious or superior when I would never mean to be) because I'm more interested in reading, other art mediums and creative outlets and ""the outside world"" now. But I think James might feel similarly."

The point is simply that under no sun can Kieran look good with his recorded statements and that's obvious. As I said to him I don't doubt he had to deal with some really nasty people. It takes a matter of seconds to block them and ban him from his stream, no matter how many of them come or make new accounts he can go click, click, done. They're gone.

After seeing what he said I took the time to say as constructively and thoroughly as possible, look, I get that some of these people that come into your streams try to make your life hard. But you allow them to and it bums me out we have someone associated with James who produces work with him that talks about hurting people and wishing death on strangers at all.

To this he says I am watching the clip and ""automatically assume he's wrong."" Absurd! Don't you see how he's deflecting the issue at hand? Again who said anything about right or wrong or sides. That's what I was getting at in the portion of my comment you quoted.

Suddenly it became really clear when James was actually bad at the game or didn't understand a mechanic because his voice relaxed, he had less energy, (non in terms of effort or time spent on the videos, they were still great and had a lot of love put into the craft. I mean the kind of hypo-enthusiasm he had in the NES Accessories video. That's my all-time favorite episode.) and would often do serious, documentary style episodes where it was really James just sitting down and discussing a game, like the Castlevania Retrospective.

At first and when he wrote that FAQ everything was consistent and satirical that it wasn't important that he was bad at the game or something to even notice. It was just about making fun of how silly it was and viscerally describing how frustrating and perplexing it was to try to work with or make progress in, and it clicked so well because many if not most kids back in the day didn't read the manuals even though games were designed with people having read the manuals first in mind.

But when he started making episodes documenting the history of the game and going through the manual, it was clear when he would mention something not even with the express intent of being humorous that was just an oversight due to not caring or paying attention."

But in the second message he says that there would be no point taking the time to do this and doesn't want to. It was a closed case from the start because all the issues are his doing. Seriously, why doesn't he block or kick people out of his streams if he doesn't like what they say?

I think what's really tragic is that James could have his cake and eat it, too. He could have kept Cinemassacre going as an operation and had people to help in a mutually beneficial relationship where he profited off of videos he paid other people to help out with and had time for his family and personal projects. Selling out to an extent is fine, even necessary. I'm not the best at articulating it but James is like a **sell-out sell-out.** When seemingly goes out of his way to find the dullest, lowest people to come on board it calls into question any appreciation he had for his art or creative work to begin with."

It's worth mentioning that James was rather hands-off from the beginning. I just read from someone here that Mike was commenting with the JamesNintendoNerd channel at the very beginning (2006), responding to comments he didn't like with comments like ""fuck you"" etc. Mike would also completely write scripts that James would read from the beginning.

In a way things have always been like this (James reading scripts that weren't his writing for episodes and allowing bad PR people to be rude to fans and being completely removed in that way) but it's just more constant, extreme and impossible to ignore now."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fqlgu0f,t1_fqlf5eu,1589457715.0,"Thanks for the clarification. The more you learn the more dishonest, in the wrong, hypocritical, unjustified and nuts it turns out Kieran really is. I'll admit I could have done more ""research"" especially over the events you detailed in your reply. Even though I sound invested in this no way I'm taking the time to watch those clips haha.

Maybe I just had an inflated sense of self-importance thought my words could have reached him because I meant it when I said that it makes me sad as a once-fan of Cinemassacre to see people talk like he does. And if he just ignored the people he doesn't like or kick them out they'd go away. It's like he doesn't get that it's *his* stream and he's in charge.

Turns out the guy in question wasn't even wasn't even this crazy troll that came in just to bother him. Even Justin found it funny. I wonder if Justin ever says things to Kieran like, ""eh, don't worry about it dude, don't let these guys get to you or lose sleep over it."" The way Kieran talks it's really like he's let a few comments and insensitive people be the bane of his existence for the past 2 years, and blames them for his unhappiness rather than his own obsessiveness, inability to let go and unstable emotions.

Kieran doesn't seem like the meanest or craziest guy out there, and not even the dumbest. He's just really unhappy, short-sighted, obsessive, attached, and a little sick with some real anger problems he needs to find an outlet for even when there is none.

You know something? I'm noticing a pattern here of people at Cinemassacre who can't accept agency or responsibility for their actions and decisions. Mike was a coward to incessantly blocked people and gave half-hearted apologies without acknowledging why he did the things he did. Kieran is somehow the victim for running a stream where he engages with people he doesn't like and wastes his breath looking like a moron saying all sorts of crazy things about them instead of blocking them and moving on.

This is what really shows how deluded he is to the point that it's just sad.

There was never a question of ""wrong"" or ""right"" and sides. Without a doubt some nasty people were bothering him while they had nothing better to do and trying to ruin and interfere with his stream.

Watch this.

I don't know anything about his second daughter. His first daughter had a problematic birth. When she was born for a while she could not move one of her arms.

In summary the nerves of her arm were stretched and she also suffered a brachial plexus injury, clavicle fracture, and developed torticollis. This information is all in the video, 3 minutes in. This was all when she was a newborn so things are different now.

She is now has full recovery of her arm and can move both of her arms and is doing well and is in good health. These are all physical conditions by the way. Mentally she is fine. When infants have difficult or complex births sometimes it's because they have a genetic condition that also makes them mentally different or deficient. There is a correlation between problematic births and infants with rare problems they have throughout their life. But there's a lot of misconceptions about it because most people do not know a lot about the topic and talk otherwise. She isn't ""deformed"" from birth, the issues that she went through were physical from nature and a direct result of the complications in the birthing process itself.

But for a while many factors were uncertain. It's a lot to go through as a parent. More so than the child in a sense, who had pain to deal with but lives moment by moment and does not worry in the same way."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fql0j4h,t3_gj11qn,1589442091.0,"They still teach physical film in photography and film classes in universities. It's not an art everyone wants to die. I agree that they should focus on digital more and give students more options to make the most of their time and actually be as prepared as possible for the work force in their field and the technology it will be expected of them to know how to use though. At the same time, if you're in an environment with professors that remember how to use it, all of the dark rooms and equipment they had over years to teach it when it was the only technology available, they might as well still teach it instead of throwing it all out the window.

From my understanding when you shoot on the most advanced HD cameras it's on physical film also. Some cameras shoot on HD film and then you transfer it as video files to a computer."

TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkxic2,t1_fqka2s3,1589439258.0,"The difference is James would never make a public admission of being mentally ill as an aggressive defense mechanism to his fanbase as whole who by and large were simply wondering what was going on, or in general get angy at people online the way Noah has. And Noah got angy over bad flack from the fact that he was making money off of some real fools who were paying him to commentate on movies on Twitter and do a livestream of a video game for a couple hours once every few months.

James has been disingenuous over the years, frankly I think it was disingenuous to make a fundraiser for the AVGN movie at all given how much money he made over the years through website ads, video ads and DVD/merch sales. Which could have funded a movie that was better. With a smaller budget.

But you know what? He made the movie. He actually fulfilled the fundraiser. People gave him money for a thing, and he gave them the thing.

It's so hard to compare Noah or James because James at least got clever and found a way to make money *while* still crapping out content, even if it's crap and not his. He's got a wife, a house, two daughters, financial stability and a whole operation and company turning its gears for him. I'm not saying it'll last forever or be smooth sailing from there. But I couldn't imagine Noah having his shit together enough to be half as functional as James has managed to been. Even if that functionality is mostly superficial and side-stepping having to work or be honest with what he wants to do. It's still at least 0, whereas Spoony is below 0."

TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkwfw2,t1_fqkoqpc,1589438315.0,"He says I ""automatically assume he's in the wrong."" Notice how he makes everything about sides. He's the victims and we're the antagonizes. In my messages I made a pretty clear point that this wasn't at all what anything was about. The guy writes and edits the reviews for AVGN, reviews movies with James, and threatens people with violence on the internet. It's not cool or ok. Period. There's no justification for it, and the justification he gives by saying that there were trolls harrassing him is pathetic. Big fucking whoop, why didn't he block them? Because he loved it. Why did he put up with the ""constant harrasment"" for ""3 hours?"" Even if the troll made multiple accounts, which I'm sure they have, he could block each one as it sprung up. He makes a massive deal about it to the point that he feels the need to threaten people with death and violence and vividly describe the bad things he hopes happen to them...and it's all in his head. And we're the crazy ones.

Screw you Kieran, since you're probably reading this, and screw James, Mike, Tony, and Justin for associating. And I'm not fond of Ryan either because this behavior reflects on his company Screenwave and he should feel ashamed for allowing it to happen also. For *his* sake and integrity.

It's amazing what Kieran has gotten away with: he says he would say and do worse if he could so he knows that due to his position and contracts there's a limit to how far he can go with the harassment. An open admission that he's no better than the lowest trolls that have bothered him over time. Not that he ever appeared better than the trolls anyway, but we have him on record saying the only reason he's not saying even worse things with more frequency is because he's worried for his job. No doubt we do not live in a fair world but if we he did this guy would have lost that a *long* time ago."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkuh44,t3_gjedxk,1589436630.0,">Jesus Christ. You've literally been capturing the entire convo and posting it to reddit. What in the fuck is wrong with you? Is that the new way you guys have to get clout? Take advantage of someone trusting you and trying to actually have a real conversation for once? You guys are so fucking CRAZY! Dude seriously, yet again, you've introduced another thing I have to get ready for. You people are so fucking crazy, you have no value for actual human interaction, you just want upvotes. You are all so SAD. You all need serious help. And for the people when you inevitably post this on reddit, let them know I feel super sorry for all of them and hope they one day mature from this state of weird, sad loserdom. Jesus Christ, get a fucking life man. You're fucking sad.

I just realized that he saw this post on reddit. I wasn't reading [his reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCinemassacreTruth/comments/gjedxk/kieran_and_i_having_a_civil_discussion_on_twitter/fqkrknw/) carefully. I assumed he went on here less than he does. Man, he goes on here *all* the time. He feels like I betrayed his trust. Hence the last uber angry message and blocking. I thought it was a good idea to cross-post so people could see he was trying to be civil and consider his perspective. Perhaps I should have told him I would first, but he likely would have said nothing in that case.

It's not like it's exactly opening up on his part to mention another case of trolling for sympathy anyway. I was legitimately trying to bring people in to give their two cents to see if there could be some understanding. But he just saw the post and interpreted it as a betrayal. At least he blocked me and is just done with it, so I don't have to worry about some crazy Reddit DM from an alt account of his.

It doesn't really matter, but it seems like my efforts backfired. He says, ""you've introduced another thing I have to get ready for."" It was not my intention to make him more guarded and less likely to discuss with people, but it looks like that's exactly what the result of my messages would be. But again, this isn't the kind of guy that would want to come to an understanding anyway. If he was he wouldn't have been saying all the shit that would cause people to dislike him in the first place. What's sad is that he would have gotten the inevitable wave of internet-hate from people that didn't like him in the videos anyway. And he just can't separate that in his mind from the people that legitimately aren't cool with the fact that he wishes death threats to people on the internet and works with a channel with James who built up a legacy over a decade in the making of being the last kind of person that would ever stoop so low, which for a while felt like an oasis in the world of internet content creators. That oasis has dried up."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkt6xv,t1_fqksxpa,1589435591.0,"I don't think you're Kieran, I just started off the comment that way as if I was talking to him.

If there was something you don't understand in the comment let me know and I can clarify. But when you say ""wat"" I only know that there was something you didn't understand about it but I don't know which part confused you.

My point is just that he seeks out negative attention. Nothing was ever stopping him from ignoring the trolls and no matter how far they went they were all as benign as dwweeb because they can be blocked in one click. The fact that we're even talking about his reactions over the years means he didn't ignore it not because he *couldn't* but because he didn't want to because he thrives off of negative attention. It's a real thing."

TheCinemassacreTruth,fqksjgz,t1_fqkrnif,1589435070.0,">I remember when I was more involved in his twitch streams there’s was a guy named dwweeb who would constantly show up in different fake accounts.

That sounds funny. Most Twitch streamers would laugh at that and the rest of their fans would laugh with them. Fuck, if one of them went as far as to message my widowed Mom on Facebook I would even find that kind of funny. It's not like it's hard to find Ms. Fallon by...I dunno, finding her son on Facebook and then clicking her profile. (or if it's private, happening to know a guy who knows a guy in the NJ area that has a mutual friend...) I mean that's going far just to get a reaction. As Kieran himself admits some people are pathetic and have no lives to go that far. But I can imagine something even more pathetic than that. It's getting so severely upset by it instead of laughing it off that you fail to realize that at the end of the day you are the primary reason the majority of this shit gets flung your way, and never realizing this."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkrknw,t3_gjedxk,1589434322.0,"Alright guys here we go, he responded and he wrote a lot. It's a message to the entire subreddit ;) If you prefer to read it as an image instead of copied and pasted into this comment, [I uploaded an image of the messages as well.](https://i.imgur.com/WfiHQkD.png)

He thinks I'm someone I'm not and it's quite clear he didn't read what I wrote carefully. More importantly he goes on a blind rage and rant, clearly something he had bottled up regardless. I was more like the trigger that set him off by bringing up certain things. He's nuts but it's still funny that he's sitting there messaging me when I am not the person he clearly has in mind.

First, a little context for what prompted him to go on a large part of his tangent. [In my reply to these two messages which I commented here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCinemassacreTruth/comments/gjedxk/kieran_and_i_having_a_civil_discussion_on_twitter/fqkgw69/) I made sure to articulate a specific instance where a user by the name of Zeldaschampion asked if AVGN would be slowed down due to COVID-19. [From this accounting of the events,](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCinemassacreTruth/comments/fzmnq5/kierans_drunken_twitch_stream_and_his_attack_on/fnbjffg/) by u/Cineamphobia from a recent post, the question was innocent, but Kieran assumed that it was a recent troll that had been sending harassing messages including those related to Coronavirus. So in a clip he reacts angrily to the guy who asks the question and then realizes it's a different guy and retracts his statements and understands.

I gave this as an example because I thought (I know, I know, it was a silly mistake and I gave the guy way too much credit. Funny results though) it would help: Kieran was saying that every time the clips are posted they're altered to paint him negatively and used to slander him. Here I have an example where u/Cinemaphobia is doing just the opposite. People in the thread were saying that Kieran was attacking someone who didn't deserve it, and then he commented, with unedited video proof, explaining that Kieran thought the commenter was someone he wasn't (a recent troll) and then Kieran realized his mistake and it was OK. I explained it very clearly but I just lost him and he went off in a fit of rage. Which is especially funny because he did the same mistake again: thinking a user is someone they're not. It's a habit of his and easily explicable: he seeks out antagonists where there are none. The fact that there are a few legitimately nasty apples obviously doesn't help but he'd want to engage in these conflicts regardless.

It's remarkable how obvious it is from the way he acts that *he* is the primary cause of the misery he's experienced for during the last 2+ years. No matter how many trolls there were, he could have ignored them. As much as he claims it drives him crazy, he clearly loves all of this drama. A lot more than we do actually.

He went full retard and blocked me. So that's the end of that and his own words seem to imply as much that he sees this as a culmination of sorts. He says, ""You are the last."" As he said many people were sending him messages, according to him ones similar in nature to mine.

Here are the ""final words"" of his for you to read. Complete and unedited. There's some nuggets of gold here particularly at the end, predictably. [Here is an image](https://i.imgur.com/WfiHQkD.png) that contains all of the screen-shotted messages in one place as proof. Though his writing style should be proof enough.

>Oh ok, so the Zelda's Champion guy. Well first off, what you don't see in that clip is the constant harassment from that guy beforehand, who was also a member of the reddit. His remarks also weren't harmless. He wished COVID on myself and my coworkers. Ever wonder how it made its way to the subreddit? He was looking for a reaction. But the video clip cut all of that out and only shows yet again, what they want you to see. Enough for you to form an opinion and message me. Yeah I said what I said, and yet again, I stand by it. I hate that reddit. I hate the people in it. This guy is yet another of the people who have spent all their time harassing me, but they clipped it in such a way that it looks like an unprovoked attack. You don't see the entire rest of the stream where he's harassing me constantly throughout Dude, once again, thank you for being civil, but I really don't feel the need to justify my actions to you or anyone on that reddit. All I keep seeing from you is your vain attempt of justifying a few people who visit an harassment reddit. Once again, thank you for being civil in this, but you're on the wrong side of this. Say what you will, there is absolutely nothing justifiable about any of the people on that site.

Guys who think because you message me, and act civil, but have no understanding, that I have to be nice and message you and explain why I'm annoyed. You are the last. So take what I'm saying to you to heart. I have been under constant harassment from that subreddit. They harass me on twitter, instagram, facebook, Youtube, and Facebook. What you saw, was a 2 minute clip of a 3 hour stream where a person was constantly attacking me. I finally said something, they clipped it and posted it. I get it, my twitch is private, I'm stupid for assuming people wouldn't record it. Or maybe I just wasn't prepared for the amount of crazy I'd face from all the people on that reddit. It's straight up obsession to a really upsetting level.

TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkpg5r,t1_fqkoapp,1589432732.0,"It's true. In all fairness, there was some manipulation on my part. I saw him opening up about how it's been tough, so I figured if I validated it, he might be willing to say more. Not because I wanted him to spill the beans. My intentions were good, to have a discussion about this. Maybe he could learn something and the new perspective would realize that regardless of how much negative attention he gets, he's feeding it and creating more based on how he reacts. It's a simple concept and if he was going to understand it he would have a long time ago. The issue was never the things the people on the internet said, it's his ego and that's a lot harder to unwind.

At any event he responded. It's a decent size rant. I'm going to post it here."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkotzf,t1_fqknjwg,1589432287.0,">I hear people online all the time also play victim about being bullied or pull out the ""I've had death threats!"" line when you can browse half the internet or play most online games and get someone either telling you to kill yourself or saying they will kill you within the hour. It's not worth being crybaby over. Credible stuff goes straight to the police anyway if you're remotely sane and you'd do it silently too for obvious reasons.

Yes, great point and it needs to be said. I have said that a certain amount of negativity would be inevitable regardless of what he did or said. But he welcomes more trolls because of how he responds to the trolls that would exist anyway. He wouldn't like to hear it, but his problem is that he takes them too personally. It's something everyone has to go through to an extent. If they're remarking his address that is one thing and there's a set-up in this society to deal with that. Kieran Fallon is the guy's real name so if the troll just happened to find his father's real name simply by finding his first name since it's safe to assume when he started to search his last if Fallon, that doesn't mean he doxxed or tracked him down but more likely just found it by searching ""Kieran Fallon"" on Google or Facebook and poking around until a family-link, post or article concerning the passing with the name came up.

So even in that case, he's taking it too personally. Trolls are stupid but some are smart enough to know what works. The typical ones just say ""fuk u die kys"" but then you have the kind that Kieran dealt with, who know that people look at more generic insults and just say, ""just a regular troll. Block."" But if they can have that personal edge, they'll get the emotional reaction they're looking for. Kieran just wasn't aware enough to see that, as obvious as it was that the troll's only intent was to bother Kieran and see him get mad for the amusement of it. The means or ""style"" that they employed his dad's name was just that, a means to an end. A poison-tipped arrow is still an arrow. Except either way, the arrow is made out of paper and the poison is drawn on with a crayola marker. It's the internet so it isn't a real thing, and it's not like it happened incessantly. And even if it *did*, there's a reason Twitch lets you block people no matter how many accounts they make.

I'd like to think he's learned better by now, but his defensive messages where he openly states that he stands by all of the death threats he's made in the past certainly do not suggest that."

Precisely this."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fqkminc,t1_fqklx6i,1589430662.0,"I agree completely. He's using it as a way of deflecting the fact that he's wishing violence and death on people. It sucks he had to go through with people that suck like that. But why didn't he just block, report, and remove them from his stream and move on? He makes such a point of lowering himself to their level and saying nasty things that it's almost like a part of him likes it. Maybe he's learned since then but this all recent and ignoring trolls on the internet and just getting rid of them shouldn't be a hard lesson for a grown man who's been using the internet for years to understand. He's successfully tarnished the reputation of Cinemassacre, and worse yet for him tarnished his own reputation and gave that troll and others like him exactly what they wanted and came there to harass him for to begin with."
