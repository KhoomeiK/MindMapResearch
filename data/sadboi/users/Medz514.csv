BipolarReddit,fjj6iee,t3_fdh9qw,1583384739.0,Anyone else ? Yes for the majority who take it ! That stuff is basically a mild horse tranquilizer with unbearable side effects for some who take it . My doc put me on the XRs extended release was like 8pills in 1 I took it once and never again. IMO all our problems are self created in our minds. If there is a need for medicine I go for the stuff grown from the earth not fabricated by a white coat in a lab.
BipolarReddit,fjj6c81,t3_fdhj08,1583384598.0,"Been there felt that way and the best way to cope is to talk to someone. Family, friend , if you have neither than a stranger works lol I remember when I was severely depressed (I’m BP1) I would want to talk to strangers just to get thier point of view. Hope this can help you"
BipolarReddit,fjj62af,t3_fdeqcm,1583384367.0,"Hello,

I finished a degree in a Finance from John Molson school of business in Montreal. I am bi polar 1. I was manic for parts of my schooling and in depressive states for most of the time. I couldn’t focus on anything either my mind was a never ending carrousel of negative thoughts. What helped me was mediation but mostly positive visualization . I literally watched a clip from the secret with the boy who wanted the bike so he put pictures on the wall of a bike and looked at it every morning until he got a bike. I put in big black letters “ I will Finish this degree! “ and every morning when I woke up not wanting to leave my sanctuary others call a bed I would stop and think to myself get up you can do this. Hope this helps you I’m sure you will finish it. I had over 60 credits of a 90 credit program and wanted to drop out but that voice you don’t think exists or you haven’t heard in a while is still in your head you just need to listen to it more instead of the other disruptive thoughts."
BipolarReddit,fjj5ntg,t3_fdn5nv,1583384042.0,Been there you need to stop the suffering in your head I don’t know your situation but once I stopped killing myself mentally the bad  thoughts went away. For me what helped was my dog and meditation and going for walks . May god be with you .
BipolarReddit,fe0003l,t3_en4qid,1578799802.0,I’m 33. I had my first manic episode at 18 but I triggered it by doing drugs. After that I was manic again three years later and again three years after that. Every single time the mania was followed by terrible depression. For me I have triggers so I need to be careful especially with marijuana & Alcohol And I need to stay away from cocaine . Exercise eating healthy as I can helps as well and I haven’t been manic since 2016 so I know what works for me. You shouldn’t be scared you know now a bit about it since u went through it once you will know right away when you need help.
BipolarReddit,fdzzggh,t3_ena16d,1578799477.0,Have you ever tried electro convulsive therapy. I know at first thought it’s scary because of how it is portrayed in media but I have now been off all my meds for the last year and I did only 5 sessions of ECT for my treatment resistant depression and it worked !
BipolarReddit,fdzz2bh,t3_en7wqi,1578799240.0,"Honestly I have been in the tornado of mania , normal, and depressed for damn near half my life . I am 33 and have gone through four major manic episodes and four major depressions. In between after the mania and before the depression there is always a feeling of being normal. That feeling when you think to yourself how you could have been depressed for that long. For me what I know is I have triggers. If I want to control the mania I know I have to stay away from cocaine and watch my marijuana and alcohol intake. It’s like a pendulum swinging back and forth. I have been at both spectrums but I’m always trying to stay at around 50% (equilibrium) with a bit of mania like symptoms (Steve jobs) to push me to be successful like am by people who struggle with bipolar. Hope that helps !"
BipolarReddit,fdzyo83,t3_en8z70,1578799003.0,I took lithium for over ten years to manage my bi polar. After going through the worst down period of my life I had one last resort for my treatment resistant depression and it was ECT. I did five sessions total in the span of one year and I have been off all Medz for two years now. Lithium is a god send def keep taking it if you need it but the damage it did to my kidneys isn’t worth it in the long run if there are other options.

BipolarReddit,fbt4y5m,t3_eebg8k,1577068408.0,I have bi Polar2 and have experienced many manic episodes and depressions. In July 2017 when I got my dog Prince I was depressed. I have always had love for all animals but I couldn’t love him while I was in this rut. I would stay in bed until 1-2 pm and he would just sit there staring at me. I started to think while I lay here not caring about myself he needs me to let him go out to pee and go for a walk. Prince was instrumental in beating my last and worst depression and I adore every second with him now. Pets are definitely a form of therapy !
