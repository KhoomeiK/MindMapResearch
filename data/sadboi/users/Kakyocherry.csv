LongDistance,fjy7azq,t3_ffd652,1583691270.0,"I know your feeling...  My boyfriend leaves in England, me in Spain. And I have a chronic illness (cystic fibrosis) so it's a high risk for me right now travel... Or even for him if he comes to see me...  I'm really worried about the whole situation right now,  and besides I have BPD (borderline personality disorder) which makes things even more unbearable. All I need is his support and its difficult if we are not together... So yeah... Fuck this stupid virus tbh...  I don't know how long I will be until I can travel again. Just to be safe..."
BorderlinePDisorder,fjovq3f,t3_feg0qe,1583535795.0,"If i could, i would hug you...  i feel exactly the same...  and i don't want to lose my boyfriend. He is the most lovely person i ever met.... he always take care of me, he treats me like a princess and i..  i am a mo nster...  and i feel so miserable and i dont deserve his love. I fucking understand you, really. We bpd people literally live in hell..."
BPD,fjlvflh,t3_fe2w6b,1583455364.0,"It's funny. I just came to reddit tonight to feel some kind of relief... as i dont stop crying and im doing so bad these days...  and i read this. Yes, it happens, it happens to me all the time... i struggle to have ""two identities"" when BPD takes over me. Now im in that other side of me. The awful side, the depressed, the paranoid, the full of rage side. The splitting demon side, pushing away the people i love, feeling lonely, feeling like i want to die...   its... its so difficult...  i cry while writing this. So i understand you...  we have a demon inside us, not gonna say we have a second personality but... maybe yes, we have? We are completely different from one extreme to another...  

&#x200B;

I've been kind to my boyfriend, lovely, careful, ive been feeling all the love possible... and now... i dont even recognise myself. I feel like a monster that doesnt deserve to be loved. It's a nightmare...

Sorry for ranting... just this post hit the spot..."
BPD,fik82y6,t1_fik4tb5,1582474925.0,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate that you replied. Yeah... I thought about that too. In some way I feel like I have to force myself to see him and to create memories (we are in a long distance relationship so we see each other every 2 months) so I will decide myself and get the flights and go to see him again... I'm working so hard now in controlling that inner voice. Hopefoully I will shut her voice ^^"
BPD,fejenvh,t1_fej8xvg,1579170430.0,"I think I will try yoga as its something that also relaxes my mind. Thank you so much for your advice, really. It made my yesterday night and today ðŸ˜Š"
BPD,fej7jif,t1_feipb3s,1579160204.0,"Oh, I always was intrigued by Buddhism. I admire that harmony the buddhist have. But at the same time I'm so sceptical to do yoga or mindfuklnes because again, I think I won't be able to focus or its useless and blabla. I never tried properly, though... What I like to do sometimes to relax myself is listening to ASMR (I don't know if you what that is) and sometimes it helps with anxiety. But yeah, if you know more about Buddhism I'd like to know :) I need a change in my life like, right now.."
BPD,feiozad,t1_feimm92,1579143647.0,Thank you so much ^^ sometimes i forget the success comes from trying with little steps... my problem is i want instant gratification and instant reward so i leave everything so quick. Or i think 5 minutes its not enough but doing more than that makes me anxious xD so yeah... i should turn my mind off for a moment and just act ^^
BPD,feim3ep,t1_feifnjg,1579141724.0,"tbh i should do it. I live close to a field with a lot of grass and all. I think i dont do things mostly cause i overthink too much. ""This is useless"" ""its ridiculous"" and so on. Same with exercise, i should do exercise because its good for my disease aswell (i have cystic fibrosis) and bpd stops me a lot... depression kicks me out so much, i stay playing game or in bed most of the time, and tbh that gives me anxiety cause i really need to do exercise but i always find an excuse and i dont feel mentally able to do it... \^\^U (sorry for the rant!)"
BPD,fegy6p4,t1_fefjrxv,1579105156.0,"I do that sometimes ^^ i usually waste it on food, fancy food. If i feel sad and if i am out (i rarely leave home) i treat myself â™¥"
BPD,fef4oe0,t3_eosgs1,1579048099.0,"I play a lot of videogames and everytime i end feeling empty or sad or something like that, i spend a LOT of money on items, skins, etc. I cannot help it. And the worst part is, i buy something, and few minutes later i feel empty again. But if i don't do it, i feel bad. It's hell lol..."
