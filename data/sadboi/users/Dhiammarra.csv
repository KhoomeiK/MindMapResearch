I'm just thankful I had an excellent dentist when I got my teeth because I've talked with a couple other people who have dentures and they have nothing but trouble. Just makes me glad I can wear mine with really no problem."

I wear them almost 24/7. I know you're not supposed to do that but I'm not comfortable with them out. 

Honestly, the only thing I've been really affected by since having them is not being able to bite down of whole apples with my front teeth. Eh, I just cut them up now. They fit well, I get relines every couple of years and have only had to get a new plate once in the last ten years. Nobody can tell I have dentures unless I mention it and the topic really doesn't come up."
