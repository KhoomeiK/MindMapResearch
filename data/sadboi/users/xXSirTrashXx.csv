Nirvana,fpm8eb8,t1_fpm881u,1588727665.0,Agreed although the rest of the set was surprisingly pretty damn good. Definitely needs to work on his voice though.
Nirvana,fpm7po5,t3_ge71d8,1588727264.0,"The ""don't know"" and ""knows not"" isnt that big of a deal and is rarely noticeable. Post fucked up ""In Bloom"" reaaaaaally bad; he kept on saying ""shitty songs"" instead of ""pretty songs"" in the chorus and that's way more obvious."

mountandblade,fj0s5it,t1_fiz4s4g,1582906635.0,Yeah but what's the point when you know it ends in a shit sandwich.
RedDeadOnline,fj0qf6z,t1_fj0puki,1582905625.0,"Oh ok. I apologize then, I have the other guy blocked now I wasn't exactly sure what you were replying to."
RedDeadOnline,fj0d907,t1_fj0357m,1582897030.0,"Sorry for the late response. But I never said PVP is bad, I enjoy it too. This whole thread was to talk about high levels ambushing people who are either lower levels or are minding their own business, and I really didn't tell him what to do, I just made a suggestion to doing something else besides griefing."
RedDeadOnline,fj0cxim,t1_fizzx7o,1582896782.0,Exactly my issue.
RedDeadOnline,fizduuv,t1_fizdlbj,1582860336.0,Why do the animal spawns not count? That and the camp not showing up are worst case scenario bugs considering they make they game unplayable.
RedDeadOnline,fizbrdk,t1_fizbia1,1582858872.0,"Jesus christ I hate to break it to you but shooting people before they shoot you isn't ""peaceful"" or whatever you think that word means. You also don't get Jack shit for PVP so if you are grinding you're either doing deliveries or something else. Either you are just trolling at this point or you are the exact type of person I am talking about."
RedDeadOnline,fizbifj,t1_fizb2yy,1582858702.0,"I mean shit, I maxed out all of my stuff too but I don't go running around killing low levels for fun. I'm trying to help my friends out but can't get into a session without some jerks in it. If there is no new content I simply don't play or grind money and gold."
RedDeadOnline,fizbd4f,t1_fizaxtl,1582858601.0,Murdering in the game for no reason and then harassing players when they have done nothing to you is exactly what griefing is.
RedDeadOnline,fizb528,t1_fizaye5,1582858443.0,Haven't played them for a while except for daily challenges. But if that's the case that sucks. They were occasionally fun if you had a good group of friends to play with.
RedDeadOnline,fizb1q6,t1_fizakt6,1582858378.0,I'm not talking about self defense (Which seriously needs to be reworked). Just complaining about griefing.
RedDeadOnline,fizauut,t1_fizajbe,1582858244.0,Who said I was having a tantrum? I'm responding to you and then you tell me griefing is fun. That was my response I don't care if it upsets you.
RedDeadOnline,fizap2c,t1_fizabp6,1582858132.0,I would love solo sessions but then I would have an empty world I don't mind players I just get sick of griefers. Also I don't feel like configuring my router just to play in peace.
RedDeadOnline,fizaksb,t1_fizac4k,1582858053.0,I know I'm not saying all level 200's are dicks I've actually run into some pretty nice people online. To me at least all griefers tend to be in that level range. As for the aggressive markers it doesn't seem to be working for me since I have only seen that work about twice since it was implemented.
RedDeadOnline,fizac9a,t1_fiza2ey,1582857892.0,I can't really tell you what to do because you paid for the game. But I suggest playing a different game instead of making this one worse.
RedDeadOnline,fiza8ds,t1_fiza18l,1582857817.0,Nope PS4. I'm not talking about new players although I have had my issues with low levels trying to shoot me in the head while I'm minding my own business. But they aren't as irritating as they aren't very hard to defend against.
RedDeadOnline,fiz9zy8,t1_fiz9jup,1582857656.0,So do it in a showdown. That's literally what it's for. Not to mention the fact that getting blasted in the face by someone with way more time on the game compared to a level 30 or something it's pretty discouraging for newer players. Forget all of the bugs but I genuinely believe it's the toxic players driving people away from playing online more.
RedDeadOnline,fiz9txs,t1_fiz9i6q,1582857544.0,I have been in now 4 sessions in a row with 200+ all picking on lower levels I'm 122 myself but it's not even close to fair when there is 3 of them.

AdamRagusea,f8s00fh,t1_f8rzqo2,1574761993.0,Pretty awesome. Pretty similar to a garlic breadstick. Also with the pizza stone I used I got a seriously crispy crust on the bottom. Will definitely make this again whenever I have leftover dough.
AdamRagusea,f8ry4lx,t1_f8rxayp,1574758974.0,Good luck with that. I'm not sure if the dough would start going bad at that point or not. Mine was only about 5-6 days old and it had more than doubled in size.

reddeadredemption,f83qspn,t1_f83j92r,1574218498.0,I mostly just did it because I had money burning a hole in my pocket but still I would have rather saved around $1000 on mostly cosmetic things.
reddeadredemption,f83qodx,t1_f83nwff,1574218411.0,Are you serious? GTA Online had TWO major updates and they were both something that should have been in from the beginning. RDO has been out of beta for less than a year and it has gotten one large update so far. It's doing much better content wise.
reddeadredemption,f83czlh,t1_f82hror,1574209430.0,It's exactly what they did with GTA Online. Although in my opinion they are doing it much better this time around. Just gonna have to play other games in the meantime.
reddeadredemption,f83ctd1,t1_f82j8pm,1574209320.0,Same :/
reddeadredemption,f7r73s8,t1_f7dkakl,1573976009.0,There are exactly enough tokens to unlock everything. Now the tough decision is whether or not you want to spend $500 on an outfit that you will get bored of in 2 hours.

BatmanArkham,f4tfxy6,t1_f4tecb6,1571787923.0,Except there isn't any proof the game will be set after AK. Also if WB Montreal releases a game called BATMAN: Arkham Legacy they are gonna catch a lot of shit for using his name to get more sales.
BatmanArkham,f4sj15z,t1_f4sihrb,1571778031.0,Yeah like I said to another guy. I'm fine if it was their own game. But I feel like it's going to be one of those situations where more is less.

guns,exj8gys,t3_ct8920,1566344288.0,This is my dad's .22 that suffered some pretty bad water damage on the wooden stock and a little on the front of the barrel. This is also my first time bluing steel. I cold blued it with birchwood casey perma blue and I also used the blue and rust remover that came with it. It looked pretty good until i washed the blue/rust remover off and then parts of the barrel turned brown (pretty sure they are a different metal). I put the bluing on the sights to test and it worked ok. as it dried it looked much worse. Same with the barrel. It's drying splotchy and the metal looks pretty rough after rinsing the cleaning solution off of it. Should I just take it to a proffessional? I kinda wanted to do it myself and don't wanna spend the money. But if that's my best/only option of getting this to work that's what i'll do.
