beatmakers,flr9yof,t1_flr9bc7,1585415982.0,Of course bro. When I first started automation confused me a ton so just tryin to make it easier to understand
beatmakers,flp27rk,t3_fq765c,1585350179.0,"Also here‚Äôs how you achieve what you‚Äôre wanting in your video. 

1) Delete all automation clips created already (left of the playlist under the automation tab, right click and delete as they can mess with your track even if not in the playlist)

2) In grossbeat, right click ‚Äúempty‚Äù and create automation clip. Then stretch this clip to the length of time you want that active. 

3) Back to grossbeat, right click the preset you want to use and copy value 

4) Go to automation clip and find the point you want the preset to turn on. Stretch the automation clip without moving the point on the far right of the clip, just extend the automation block

5) Right click to create a new point and position it in the time you want the preset to turn on

6) Right click that new point and paste value, this will create the vertical line indicating the change 

7) Extend the automation block to the end of the section you want the preset active on. Right click at the point you want the preset to turn off, then paste value on that point, creating a horizontal line from the initial point to the end point.

8) Right click on me of the points with the same value as when the preset was off and copy

9) Create a new point where you want the preset turned off, paste the value you just copied. 

This will create a section with no preset, then it turns on, then it turns off"
beatmakers,flp1798,t3_fq765c,1585349605.0,"Not sure how familiar you are with automation so I‚Äôll try to be detailed: That value you copied is used in the automation clip found in Track 2 of the playlist, you just missed the step of inputing that value into the automation clip. If you hover you mouse over one of the points on either side of the automation, you‚Äôll see a value appear in the upper left corner of FL. 

In reference to the video, say for the first section you want the automation on but for the second section you want it turned off:

Extend the automation clip so that it is the same time duration as both sections. (Ie: the colored block is the same length as both sections)

Then, where you want a change in preset or to turn it off, add another point in automation by right clicking the line in the automation clip and dragging it around to the desired point. This is where the copy value comes into play.

The value you copied is the same as the automation clip that was created, so pasting the value will do nothing. But if you want to switch the preset you‚Äôd go into grossbeat, right click the preset you want and copy the value, go to the automation clip and right click on the new point you created. Click paste value. 

This will result in an incline or a sharp cliff looking line. Move that point using the left mouse button to where you want the preset change to happen. Make sure the point stays at the same value tho, sometimes when you‚Äôre moving them around the values can change so I always right click and paste again after moving to my desired location. 

Hope this helped"

FL_Studio,fiufb3o,t3_f9r0hr,1582740307.0,"I‚Äôve been going through that for the past couple months as well. Sometimes stuff happens in life and gets in the way or you just lose that spark. But chalk that up as part of the creative process. Being inspired 24/7, 365 is impossible. Some might be better than others, but everyone goes through lapses where they‚Äôre making stuff not up to their standards. And it‚Äôs tough to go through because you want to be making good stuff but it‚Äôs just not coming out and it gets to you easily as a creative. 

These are the things I‚Äôve been doing to help get back into it and they‚Äôve been helping:

1) Listen to new music. Old, new, and from different genres. You might hear a chord progression or a sound that you‚Äôve never heard or a song structure you‚Äôve never used before because all music is different and you can find inspiration in the smallest things. 

2) Watch beat tutorials. Seeing someone else‚Äôs process and trying it out might get you thinking about beats at a different angle. When you‚Äôre stuck making the same beats with the same formula, I feel it can get repetitive and that takes the fun out of it for me at least. I feel like I‚Äôm on a beat assembly line. Check for ways they‚Äôre thinking outside of the box and try those out. It might spark ideas you never had before and one small idea can snowball into something cool. 

3) Remind yourself what go you into it. I felt that when I hit my block, it was because I was treating making beats differently when I started. I got into it because it was an escape from the world and it was fun. When I hit my block I was thinking too much about outside input, how I‚Äôm going to make money with it, and it took the fun out of it. While these are valuable concerns to have, you have to balance it with why you‚Äôre doing it. We all started making beats because we wanted to, so why let anything like critics or money take that away from us? 

Hope this can help and good luck"
Beatmatch,firfq9q,t1_firf15c,1582663531.0,Yea the YouTube to mp3 is what I‚Äôve been doing since I‚Äôm not playing for anyone but myself in my room. If I decide to start doing more serious performances I‚Äôll definitely check out a record pool. Do you have any recommendations?
AdvancedProduction,fi8l0gy,t3_f71zzs,1582242627.0,"You mentioned it your post, but personally trying to balance work and school with production gets tedious. I find that during the day when I‚Äôm at work/school, I feel inspired and am excited to go home and create or work on my projects, but come the end of the day I‚Äôm exhausted and my brain powers been used up. 

Then when I sit down and feel like I make something that doesn‚Äôt work for me, I often get discouraged and am too tired from the day to keep trying. It gets frustrating because I want to produce and I want to feel inspired, but when I‚Äôve been drained from homework, working with customers, etc. it becomes another task in the day, and it‚Äôs tempting to take the easy way out and just sit back and relax. 

Plus add on family, friends, and the fact that you should probably eat something and sleep once in awhile, and all this time that could be spent working on your craft is taken away from. 

Overall I think a coach would be beneficial. With someone else giving you that boost to hold yourself accountable, I think in the long run you‚Äôd develop better habits about sitting down and working on your craft. Also with someone helping push you, I think it would help with the frustration of not being able to come up with anything and giving up."

This is a song I made with my girlfriend on vocals at my unis student recording studio. We both went in not feeling that inspired and I laid some chords down that you can hear in the beginning of the song. 2 hours later, she had wrote the small hook, the layers had fallen into place, and the bass was booming. I chopped up her vocal recording for an entertaining ‚Äúverse‚Äù section that repeats a couple times and is the main focus of the song. 

I think the meaning of it falls into what both she and I were feeling at the moment. We‚Äôre both fairly new with making our own music, and with the struggles of seeing new trends and standards being placed into genres every day with the thousands of songs that get uploaded, it might be easy to get overwhelmed and feel unworthy. But it is important to sit back as an artist, and as a person, and separate yourself from the rest in order to create your own sound and find your own voice."
