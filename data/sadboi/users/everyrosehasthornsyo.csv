selfharm,f1du96e,t3_d8ymti,1569399794.0,"Oh boy. I have had a few.
One time, a walmart employee pointed out my scars  on my thigh while I was shopping with a friend (he was some greasy 20 something year old and we were 18 or so). He was like ""Holy shit, where did that come from?"" I got mad and showed him my arm, with fresh scars. I scared him, needless to say. 
Another time, I was waiting for a carry out order at a sub shop, and some guy started a casual conversation with me. When I got up to get my food, he yelled at me ""OH MY GOD! YOU ASS HOLE!"" and drew the whole restaurant's attention towards me. He pointed at my scars on my thighs and I told him to mind his own business. He proceeded to try to ask me about everything and didn't want to come off strong, but as patient as I am that really just hurt my feelings."

selfharm,f1dtelp,t3_d8svef,1569398605.0,"I think this is a great inside view of why you self harm. It's definitely a hard question to answer. 
I can relate to the aspect of knowing I cut equals I exists... For me, it is more of a physical manifestation of my pain, and from there I can watch myself heal, both physically and metaphorically for my emotional pain. I can see myself exist and live and heal.
I hope you can find other methods of self awareness that validate your existence other than self harm. I believe we are all deserving of that!"
ketamine,ey6c3fj,t3_cvrulj,1566852149.0,"I appreciate you describing your experience. 
I have been using smaller dosages of k to help with my depressive symptoms. I don't have schizoaffective disorder, however I do have BPD and have been misdiagnosed as Bipolar in the past. I experience crazy mood swings, deep depressions, and sometimes auditory hallucinations (due to the depression). I get frustrated with my moodiness and low feelings, so I can empathize. 
I have used Abilify but before experimenting with k. I hated it and it made me kind of aggressive and agitated. 
I was on Seroquel the first time I tried k, and it made me mostly sleepy and very light and floaty. It was perhaps one of the best experiences I ever had. I'm now off pharmaceuticals until I find something that can help, but honestly k has been very wonderful for helping alleviate my depressive symptoms and even my anxiety for the future. It keeps me level headed and I can see situations unclouded by judgement, or emotions, and I can process things in a more rational manner. Not only that, but it eliminates my self hatred to the point where I can kind of reset my mind, and actually gain a positive insight on myself (as opposed to me typically being overly critical and anxious about myself and my actions). 
I feel more calm, never too out of it, as I try to keep my doses minimum (small bumps, maybe .05 - .1 g at a time) but I'll redose throughout the day to keep the calmness consistent (total of 0.25 - 0.5g max).
I sometimes will do this for a day or two straight,  but I don't want my tolerance to get too high so I'll stop after 2 days. I wish I had the resources to continue to do it, even weekly, but unfortunately I can never find a reliable or affordable, consistent source. 
Hopefully one day it can be used for schizoaffectivity symptoms, and maybe more! It definetely helps with my BPD symptoms. Please keep us updated about how consistent use works for you. I'm curious!"
ketamine,ey6a7de,t3_cvt212,1566850931.0,"Honestly, I thought I had been in a k hole before (heavy, slow walking and some out of body experiences) but I guess not... 
Others have described it to me as a mild but powerful psychedelic-like experience. Some have told me they like it, others have said they hated it and felt scared and out of control of their body and situation. I'll get some close eyed visuals, mainly slow, spiral-like shapes with dark colors. Accompanied by a light to even numb body feeling. But never have I been a full blown hole..."
BPD,ey67fga,t3_cvqwbm,1566849121.0,"I have noticed changes in my self harming behavior over the last 7 years. 
It started with cutting, slowly developed into an ED/cutting, then hitting and bruising myself. 
The last 2 years, I thought I have been fine, ""cured"", because my cutting/ED had subsided, almost completely gone. 
However, I recently realized that I had been abusing substances and alcohol as another form of Self harm in that time. Although I have been trying sobriety (and made successes), I'm now back to cutting/hitting. It's a vicious cycle. 
I am glad you are noticing those self destructive behaviors in yourself."

selfharm,ewvz7mt,t3_cqfmbm,1565817058.0,"Are we the same person? Lol. All joking aside, I can definitely relate and empathize with your current situation. 
I have two names that trigger me, and I immediately lose my cool after hearing them or even meeting someone with the same name. I have had some time to cope with the trauma associated with the names, and it does get easier with time.
Although my trigger names are not someone currently in my life, I am in a similar situation and do find it extremely hard to have someone still in my partner's life who had once been romantically involved with him. Even if they don't talk every day, it is still painful to know that they are in each other's lives, regardless of your feelings. It really sucks, but please please do not hurt yourself over this situation.  
Comparing yourself to another person will only dig you deeper, and even if you don't believe it right now, you ARE worthy of love and respect, especially from yourself. No one else is better than you. You do not have to have this girl in your life or even be friends with her."
