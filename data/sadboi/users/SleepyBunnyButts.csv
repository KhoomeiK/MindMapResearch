There’s a lot of weird connotations with the phrase ‘nice guy’ but I bet your wonderful. Would you feel better if your friends used different adjectives like: sweet, pleasant, caring? 
Is being nice something you feel is a fault of yours because you’re maybe overly agreeable or can’t say no to people?"

Depending on who you’re around when you’re growing up you could be swayed either way and pressured into or away from sex. I decided to wait until I was ready. I dated a boy for 3 years in high school / college and he respected that I wanted to wait. Really soon after that relationship I started dating my current partner and we had sex 8 months into the relationship and I was nearly 21 years old. Now I hear absolute horror stories about other people’s first times and how awkward and weird it was or that they regretted it, and I’m super glad about my decision to wait until I was sure that’s what I wanted to do. I also was always pretty paranoid about getting pregnant or just nervous that sex would make the relationship harder, so I waited until I was sure it would only make it better. Having a ton of sex with different people is fine too. You have to decide what feels right for you in your life."

One person wanted to do an amazon return and said Kohl’s was the only option on their account (no idea if that’s true, but that’s an amazon issue). We need to double check sizes because we’ve had 2 orders where the ticket did not match the actual item and were a size apart (one we caught, one got picked up but we were able to fix it). Yesterday it was raining and we are supposed to ask customers to pop their trunk or roll down their back window so we can place the package in the car, but explain that we can not open or close their doors/trunks. I did this and the lady was on her phone, no open trunk or window, so I went to the passenger side window and waved at her to open something with the package in my hand. SHE DROVE OFF. I stood their shocked in the rain. Idk how she thought I magically put the package in her car but I was mortified. Thankfully she called soon after and came back. She was very confused. So was I.

I’d venture to say most people grew up with some sort of dysfunction in their families and the root of dysfunction always begins with bad communication. Even if you grew up with a super functional family (like thankfully I did) I still didn’t understand the extent to which honest, clear, and productive communication is important in relationships. People just aren’t experts in it naturally. I just recently got a BA in communication studies, and that’s where at least half my views on the subject comes from. You just have to keep reassuring people that even though it can be uncomfortable, it’s necessary to have those conversations and the relationship will be better because of it. All the people saying to just leave or withhold sex are all being pretty indirect; I fully believe that there’s hope to fix the problem. You just have to work on the communication aspect of the relationship first. That’s a skill that can totally be learned and worked on for a whole lifetime! You can only get better at it!"

It seems like you really want to leave on good terms. The only thing I would add to the scenario I mentioned is a typed up letter of resignation. Either way you want to pull aside whatever manager you’d like to have that conversation with, tell them you want to give your notice, and thank them for everything. It’s a weird thing to do, but your store should fully understand where you’re coming from. They’ve probably dealt with tons of people that they relied on quitting. Here is a link to some templates on how to write a formal letter, if you decide to go that route. https://resumegenius.com/resignation-letters

She pressed further than I would’ve thought, and I was taught to never speak poorly of past managers.

It was a great relationship and we had the number 1 children’s department out of the 50 stores. She did her job well. The interviewer basically asked if I would fire her if she wasn’t capable of change (and if I thought she was capable change). I basically said that, although I couldn’t be sure because I had only known her for 4 years, that she had changed and mellowed, but that her reputation proceeded her and that employees would going into the job with a bad attitude already.
