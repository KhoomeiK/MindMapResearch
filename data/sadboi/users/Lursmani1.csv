When it comes to less developed countries, fatality rate can be up to 30%. While Covid's fatality rate remains fairly constant everywhere, even in countries with very bad infrastructure, like Georgia. Comparing Covid to measles is just insane. 

In addition, measles mostly affects the young, and death of young people always does more harm than the death of 70+, which is over the average lifespan in the vast majority of countries. More mortality for older people is expected from any virus. That's why measles is much more dangerous - it kills the young and spreads fast, and has about 50-100 times higher fatality rate if unchecked."

This isn't a time to fall into the anchoring bias, this is a time where new data is more valuable than ever and should be the priority. 

And those are not pre-prints I'm talking about. They're from journals such as Lancet and Nature.

CFR shouldn't be used to calculate the severity of this disease. We can't make the same mistake that we made with the Swine flu. There our estimates came down from 11% CFR to 0.02% CFR. IFR is what we need to model, and luckily several governments are already on it."
