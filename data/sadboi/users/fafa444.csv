He had one gf before me when he was 19, after he didn’t have luck with woman and got into porn.

He had one night stand with woman before me but he was not able to keep getting hard.  He sometime masturbate dressing up as woman and play with dildo, often watching dick on porn. 
Then he met me, With me we had 1.5 year good relationships including sex. He forgot about porn addiction and he stop watching while with me. We got marry . Then he started crave  it again. We did sissy play and everything together which made it worse. Made him even want more that way and not able to be get turn on by normal sex. I’m very submissive woman. When we met each other.
