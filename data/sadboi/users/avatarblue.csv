FrankOcean,f7a9d12,t1_f78o0ov,1573523728.0,"I thought all the signs pointed to the mystery guest being Frank. Considering all the theories created by the fans and people who were on the “inside” hinting at Frank performing, there was no doubt in my mind it was going to be him. We also have to consider that Frank is as respected and popular among the juggernauts of hip hop/R&B. It made sense to me that Rocky, Lil Uzi, and Drake were there not only as backup artist but also fans of Frank’s work. What I believed to have happened was Frank must of backed out, for whatever reason, and Tyler had these artist as plan B."
