A pedophile is a person attracted to a prepubescent child. As in before puberty. 16 year olds have (apart from VERY unusual circumstances) hit puberty. A closer word (but still not quite accurate) is hebephile.

Age of consent exists because guess what? Humans fuck. 16 and 17 year olds are still human, even if their brains aren't fully grown and they aren't considered adults by law. So these younger people still want to have sex, and it's better to give them some legal avenue to do so then to either a) punish them for a natural (and hopefully victimless) want or b) allow them to break the law, which sets a bad example.

The issue comes when Grown Adults try to have sex with these teenagers. Because that's when it gets dangerous. Teens don't have as much experience and are more likely to be manipulated and harmed. This is why, usually, even with an age of consent, a 16 year old couldn't legally have sex with, say, a 30 year old."

""I don't get the concept of learning quickly, it's instant unless you don't 'get' the logic, connections, and reasons behind something."" This seems like the root of your issue. If you give up the moment you don't get something, you'll fail in the end. You can't live life with this 'hit or miss' 'black and white' mentality. There are too many different aspects to many different subjects for it to be so cut and dry.

Consider where you are. What do you want? What makes you happy? Pursue it, even if you think you can't. If you don't try, you'll prove yourself right and fail. 

Maybe you have something stopping you, like a mental illness. I've had that. I'd advise, depending on your age, not to take antidepressants. I was experiencing suicidal ideation and anxiety so intense I couldn't attend school, and I was diagnosed with ADD rather than depression and anxiety.
