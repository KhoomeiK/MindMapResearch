3dprintingdms,fphxap5,t3_gdemor,1588629522.0,just signed up. i look forward to your future releases!
3dprintingdms,fp8hycg,t1_fp8hesp,1588392768.0,Lol a thousand apologies. I will correct my statement
3dprintingdms,fp29ury,t1_fp245os,1588257967.0,No. I don’t think so. I had started the print before I remembered the tape suggestion. But I did make some serious adjustments to my supports as far as length and depth contacts. Took me about 30 minutes to redo hence how I got side tracked and forgot lol but I’ve got something else printing so we will see how that goes and hope that the Boneclaw wasn’t a fluke.
3dprintingdms,fozcnvx,t3_g9zivg,1588188436.0,"I haven't tried the tape thing yet, but i did adjust some support settings on the contacts like depth and length as well as exposures times etc. Currently printing it again with adjustments(8 hour wait lol) and hopefully i'll see a difference. (fingers crossed)and i don't think temp is an issue, i keep it right now in our sunroom and it stays pretty warm/comfortable in their right now, and i typically keep a towel over it to help prevent any  outside light from leaking into the printer.  also got my ultra sonic cleaner in today to help with cleaning my prints instead of just relying on IPA since its more scarce than gold and toilet paper right now. so i'm curious to see how it works. Also i'd like to take a moment again to thank everyone for their time and advice with everything."
3dprintingdms,fowosg3,t1_fownoya,1588124039.0,I’ll make the adjustments and see how it works out! Thanks for the info buddy.

depression,ffv6u07,t3_ev5g5g,1580257068.0,It won against me as well. Alarm went off. My body felt nothing but heavy and numb and exhausted. Finally called into work. And didn’t give work or anything else a second thought today.

depression,f5cen6a,t1_f58jt2x,1572133942.0,"That’s kinda where I’m at. Used to lie and mask me feelings all the time. But it in itself became so exhausting. I’ve tried it again, especially at work. But I stay tired in general so much now. That the days I put in the extra effort to pretend to be “positive “ but by mid day. I was just over it and exhausted. I also get tired of pretending for others benefit."
Tinder,f4u3nge,t1_f4u0neg,1571798305.0,You are correct on your assessment of me having little experience on tinder. But I’m not unfamiliar with the “pay for my premium” extortionist of woman who prey on men with low self esteem and desperate for some intimacy of some sort. So when my new match suggested Snapchat. That thought did cross my mind as well as possibly not comfortable with giving out her number. A crap shoot as they say. But what I have learned from tinder is to honestly treat it like a game and not seriously at all. If you meet someone. Cool. If not. Nothing loss.
Tinder,f4ri9wh,t1_f4rhv23,1571767855.0,Agreed. Asked for number. Asked if I had Snapchat. Gonna play this game out and see where it goes. Nothing to lose. Maybe it’ll be entertaining.

depression,f4rejpc,t3_dlfw2v,1571766481.0,"every. fucking. day. i'm currently on medical leave from after a friend admitted me to a local hospital with a decent psychiatry ward. kept me from falling over the edge of despair and actually doing something to hurt myself. at first i felt really good coming back home after i got out after being there for about 5 days. but now almost a month later, i'm feeling about what my normal has always been. no motivation. not interest. rather just sleep or veg in bed while something stupid plays on netflix for background noise. so no buddy you're not alone"

mildlyinfuriating,exgo7zc,t3_csgg5t,1566269473.0,"I bought my first gold to give my first gold. And I wish I could share this more. A hundred times. I am quite aware there are people who have it worse than me mental illness wise.  But I’ve pushed/shrugged off my own issues of depression and anxiety simply because of how mental illnesses are overlooked in the workplace, especially corporate, because you’re not physically impaired to do your job. “Oh, you’re sad/depressed? Well, wipe your feet at the door. And just focus on your work”. And it kills me. And yea. My work does have an EAP. Employee assistant program to help with certain things like a recent divorce or death in the family etc. but only for 5 free therapist sessions. 5. Physical disabilities are accommodated every way possible. But any mental illness is belittled and overlooked as being lazy, unmotivated, or just plain uninterested at work. And I’ve wanted to seek help so many times. But held back because of the stress that goes into finding a therapist and the financial obligations that go with it. You make the step to find one. Go to one. And get 4-5 sessions in. And realize you guys don’t click etc. and you have to start over. And it’s just all more frustrating and stressful coupled with any stress you’re also dealing with. And only makes everything worse."
AskReddit,ew8wbc5,t1_ew87f28,1565216087.0,"Man, this is so true. Especially with keeping up with the passage of time between my “good”  days and my “bad” days. I have a close friend who quite familiar with my depression issues. And when I’m having a bad or low day. I can get angry and just be an uncalled for asshole. And she catches a lot of it. And there’s so many times we’ve gotten into a arguments after I’ve a few days of feeling “good”. And she express that she’s tired of us arguing all the time. And I’ll be like “we haven’t argued in weeks if not months” and she promptly has to remind me we just argued a couple of days ago. And I’ll stop and really think about it and even sometimes look back at text messages because I’ll ether have completely forgotten or just felt like it was forever ago. And it really fucks with your head."
