This year has just been a lot of bad news for me and my family so far though. Try going outside if you can, or just sit in front of the window.  Also surround yourself with more upbeat people or people that care about you alot. If not in person by internet. Im not a professional but i hope this helps you."

Is there anyone else you can talk to in your household? If not i suggest faking an illness to go to the doctors then talk to them alone about what's really going on. Tell them how you feel and what your mom is doing. If you can't do that email or text another trusted adult like your favorite teacher or a coach what you would have told the doctor.
