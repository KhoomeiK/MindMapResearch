Y'all are getting screwed."

I wish I could get that sense of relief from afterwards, but it feels out of reach."

I've also got Narsil from Lord of the rings and Auri from Kingkiller Chronicles in the same area"

Feeling drained by a story makes sense the more you try and empathise and get in the same headspace as the characters. In Pact Blake doesn't get a moment to breathe as every threat barely resolves before it's on to something worse. Whereas action and threats in Worm were broken up with scenes/ arcs where you can see the fallout and consequences of the previous fights and conflict.

Twig and Ward both have a different focus from the constant action of Pact, and so much is happening in the conversations it feels ridiculous to say that it was wasted potential or nothing happened. Interpersonal dynamics play such a huge part in filling out characters and relationships and making the characters more believeable/ relatable. 

If you want to have a dialogue with people in the sub, maybe don't insinuate that they can't handle watching a movie, put words in their mouth, claim the author lost his touch, then get aggressive and condescending when people react to you doing all of that?"
