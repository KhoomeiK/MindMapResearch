1. I gained an awareness of my mood. This helps me to recognize when I‚Äôm feeling angry and or judgemental. It gives me a chance to decide what to do when my emotions are triggered. Before the course I would just react, saying hurtful or aggressive things. Now often times I stop myself and act in a way that aligns with my core values.
2. I gained an awareness of what my conscious mind is doing. This helps me recognize when I‚Äôm ‚Äúplaying the mind movie‚Äù, replaying emotion-triggering memories in my mind. Now I can decide to stop and think about something else.
3. I got the ability to pause my conscious mind and let my emotions subside. This is a core meditation skill and it took me about 20 hours over three days to develop. I use it at work when I‚Äôm anxious or agitated. I put on my noise-cancelling headphones, play white noise, close my eyes, and sit still, repeatedly pausing my thoughts every time they start up again. Usually after 10 mins I‚Äôm calm and can think clearly and continue my work. It‚Äôs like an emotional reset button. But it doesn‚Äôt always work. Some days I sit for an hour and still can‚Äôt achieve calm. Anyway it‚Äôs still an invaluable life skill.

The Goenka course is free, funded by alumni donations. The food is vegetarian but mostly good.  You will fart a lot the first two days while your gut bacteria rebalance. The course has some Buddhism religious content which you can ignore. The staff are really kind. And all of the students were respectful. The course is super challenging tho.

Shame is a powerful destroyer of life quality. My family instilled it in me growing up. It is possible to escape it and be healthy. For me the path to health has been through many conversations about childhood experiences, reliving things that happened, understanding them with my adult mind and correcting the misunderstandings that my child mind made at the time. These misunderstandings were the basis of a lot of my suffering. For me, therapy is a technical process of discovering wrong information in my head and correcting it."

depression,evshw0q,t3_ckwtek,1564746840.0,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre hurting. I think you can get better. Please try to find patience and courage.
depression,evshef3,t3_cl12de,1564746360.0,That‚Äôs a selfish attitude. Practice behaving in a kind and caring way to others and you will become more lovable. You will change and become less miserable. Therapy can help with this.
depression,evsgxjp,t1_evrwzrw,1564745892.0,I think it‚Äôs better to own the crying. The boy will be better off understanding that babies are blameless.
depression,evsgot4,t3_ckxi3h,1564745646.0,Your crying doesn‚Äôt hurt him. Spend time with him and be kind to him and he will grow up fine. He will enjoy having a little brother/sister!
depression,evsg8vo,t3_cl0qk5,1564745183.0,Sounds like good self care. It‚Äôs good to take care of yourself and give yourself permission to do what you need to do. I hope you can sleep better and recover soon.
depression,evsfy5e,t3_cl0616,1564744870.0,I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.
depression,evsfg1v,t3_ckt3z1,1564744317.0,"Im sorry your pet passed away. It‚Äôs not your fault. Small animals are not as resilient as humans. Their reproduction strategy is to produce many offspring in a short time. A ferret can produce 50-100 offspring in their lifetime. This is why they have shorter lives and are more susceptible to illness than humans.

It sounds like she had a good life with lots of love from you and good ferret friends to hang out with."
depression,evsen5c,t3_ckrjvc,1564743384.0,Sucks. Spoon theory might be relevant to your situation. I hope you can shift to a more comfortable environment.
depression,evsebn7,t3_cl1pwb,1564743006.0,I‚Äôm sorry you were hurt.
depression,evse1m6,t3_cl1rqw,1564742658.0,You will feel differently soon. Please be patient.
depression,evsd7dc,t1_evs33bs,1564741584.0,"If you are close to someone and they punish you for being thoughtful, then I suggest getting away from that person and staying away. There are plenty of kind people in the world. If there are no kind people around you then all I can suggest is to move. Change social circles. Or move to a new city and make new friends. I don‚Äôt know if that is feasible for you or not. I have moved many times in my life so it seems like a normal thing to do. In the last 20 years I have lived in Nashville, Chicago, Tokyo, Seattle, Fukuoka, Taipei, and now San Francisco.

When I first came to San Francisco, I knew nobody and would hang out with anyone just to avoid being alone. After a year, I realized that I didn‚Äôt like or didn‚Äôt respect most of the people I was spending time with. So I made a list of people I liked and respected and made effort to spend time with them and avoid everyone else. My life got a lot better. Now I have some friends who are good kind people. They‚Äôre not perfect. I‚Äôm not perfect. I like them and enjoy spending time with them. They are happy when I‚Äôm thoughtful toward them. For example, I hosted a potluck for one friend‚Äôs birthday a few weeks ago. To say thank you, she gave me an orchid plant.

I bet there are kind people in your community. If you spend time with unkind people, the kind people see this and assume you are unkind and avoid you. You can change this."
depression,evsc7xy,t1_evr9m24,1564740251.0,Good :)
depression,evqznzo,t1_evoy1q9,1564699581.0,"Try a different therapist. If you have a kidney infection and your doctor is unable to help you, will you just give up on doctors or find a better one?"
depression,evqz5qo,t3_ckmvf8,1564699389.0,I‚Äôve had intense dizziness during therapy when I‚Äôm trying to touch a painful idea or memory. I think the mind makes us confused as a way to sabotage therapy. Part of therapy is learning how to let ourselves experience our unhappy emotions. The mind has tons of tricks to avoid experiencing bad feelings. These tricks do a lot of harm long-term.
