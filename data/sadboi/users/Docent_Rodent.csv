worldpolitics,fimvffg,t1_fimuxyv,1582548283.0,"CHANGING THE RULES OF THE DNC THROUGH DONATIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DEBATE IS "" BUYING AN ELECTION"". 

Caps for emphasis since you keep ignoring that one. Also tv ads technically are attempts to influence your will if you want to get reaal technical as you enjoy doing. But since thats been how it works for decades i personally don't count it.

I think its obvious,  Bloomberg in particular here, that they have a vested interest in being elected as the millions they spend now might save him billions in taxes. 

Wealthy and everyone else are never exactly the same. You know that cmon.

You seriously dont know how money influences politics? If thats true you need to stop fucking around this morning and figure that shit out. You want me to teach you basic shit about politics as a whole? Venmo me lunch."
worldpolitics,fimuern,t1_fimto7c,1582547300.0,"Bloomberg is who i was talking about. Ive articulated how several times. Money influencing the election outside of the will of the voters to be honest, can be seen as buying the election.

For you to take the stance of money cant influence politics, for the rich to not use their wealth within politics and for the rich to not have a stake in this particular election that may push them farther than ones in the past, is being purposefully ignorant. Stop actively trying to be stupid, you are really good at it."

worldpolitics,fimt9q4,t1_fimsue0,1582546124.0,"Right. I thought that might be your point of view. No no one literally went to 711 for a slurpee and a election.

When adults say something like "" buying a election"" they mean someone is using money outside what is commonly accepted practices during a election, to unduly influence systems and people in their favor. Loads of grey area here for you to trip over so ill give a example.

Buying ads. Every candidate has done this. Some think buying a over abundance of ads, much more than the "" norm' is buying elections but i don't since everyone does it.

Changing the rules of the game. Now THIS is fucky. Imagine a bike race where one participant gets to start 5 seconds early because he went to the organisers and paid them lots of money. Thats not legit, and is seen as purchasing advantage.

Honestly i have my thoughts on capitalism, but in this case i just want health care. Being poor and actually struggling on my end regardless of what redditers might believe, being poor charges interest. I never could afford dental for example. Now i have a issue thats gonna cost me more to fix, that cant be ignored anymore, because i never could afford to get it fixed in the 1st place when it was more manageable.

True i could have just jumped into debt. But there again, i cant afford debt either. The system as it is now needs to change, if the rich want people like me to continue taking part in their world, ill need help or ill die. In the richest country in the world."
