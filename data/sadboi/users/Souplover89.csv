LoveIslandTV,fr0yj6i,t1_fqy3c0i,1589809652.0,"Thats what im saying. They were dragging her through the mud for no reason, especially when she couldnt defend herself, and i really didnt even see the jack/dani excuse pulled out at all that much at the time.

LoveIslandTV,fqxxe5s,t3_glgrnz,1589739305.0,I think that actually makes a lot of sense and makes the whole reaction make sense - that it was just occurring to her how rough it was going to be on the outside for her if she and tommy had taken the journey that most of the winners had - a little bit of drama but mostly happiness and love - and that she must have been really disliked for that not to get her the win.
LoveIslandTV,fqx7dwi,t1_fqvizga,1589727426.0,Honestly the way the whole villa acted. The boys were piggish about it but the whole villa thought that because they both swung the other way that automatically meant they were a good match which clearly was untrue in the end.
LoveIslandTV,fqx7843,t1_fqtzhdl,1589727330.0,"Yup! 

malin was a bit needy and controlling but ultimately harmless and there was no reason for Terry to do her dirty like that. But tom was hotheaded and controlling and it was good that relationship didnt go further because it seemed very toxic. Yet terry was doing what was best for him and sophie was being selfish."
LoveIslandTV,fqx72aq,t1_fqu7fh1,1589727230.0,"I loved Sophie. I watched the show before she passed and I always rooted for her. Perhaps cuz i am a gay woman and it was exciting to finally have a gay person on the show, but she also just seemed to have a really kind heart and a good sense of humor. Plus the whole time i saw this season i didnt realize Sophie was also a major pagaent winner cuz all we heard about was zara and her title and sophie had a bit more class about it. 

I never understood why the crappy choices she made made the whole villa so angry all the time when the behavior of other islanders in there far surpassed anything Sophie ever did. 

Like, terry can say what he wants but he asked Malin to be his girlfriend, they were exclusive, and he cheated on her. And yet (from what I remember) no one ever really gave him much pushback aside from a couple comments here and there. 

Kady was a total psycho (needs no further explaining).

And even though I dont think Emma should be fully vilified she was clearly there to stir the pot too. 

And yet sophie making some nasty comments caught the ire of everyone? I remember all the girls acting like sophie had kicked a grandma in the shin and that her behavior was unacceptable. 

Im sure she was just an easy target cuz she was a genuinely nice person who took things to heart whereas Terry wouldnt care what others say, but even so it sucked to watch. I ended up having to skip over her last few episodes before she left cuz it was so hard to watch.

Meanwhile Ellie started fights because people kept interrupting her while she was trying to tell some boring story and it was clear she wasn’t as fast thinking."
popheads,fq63d7b,t3_ggwbsp,1589123649.0,"I agree, it is definitely a need for validation. And most of the time when the stans are confident in their personal belief that the music is already great on its own it doesn’t seem like they try as hard to make it happen. 

I also feel like its a very specific kind of stan that cares about charting and is also a reflection of their artist’s want for it too. Like looking at Beyoncé, she kind of gave up on the charts a couple albums back and I don’t think fans give it too much thought anymore as a result - past some streaming parties here and there and thinking it would be a cool benefit to see a song of hers go number one again. 

Meanwhile, a few former One Direction members who will go unnamed have begged to chart high (one of them begging for number one) and their stans got to WORK to try and make that happen (some successfully, some to no avail). But even juxtaposing that against Harry Styles stans, Harry said he tries to put less emphasis on streaming numbers and charting success so he didn’t talk about it at all really (though I know he did do a lot of merch bundling) so the fans didn’t make it their mission in the way that Justin Bieber fans did when he asked them to help him get a #1. When Harry did chart at number one it was more of an added bonus to a great album being released than it was a goal achieved. 

Same w Doja/Nickis Say So vs Meg/Beys Savage remixes. Doja has been making it known she wants a #1.

Ultimately what I’m saying is that stans who are confident in the music seem less over the top about it, but the artist also sets the tone in the amount of emphasis they put on their want to chart."

But it was clear she tried really hard to like him and didn’t lead him on but rather really wanted to see if he would grow on her and it backfired and caught the ick instead. She whispered something kind of nasty but I think we all get like that when we are sick of someone. Logically and realistically she handled it like a real person would and not like a reality star worried about public opinion- bitched to her friends, was quietly a bit irritable, and broke it off a bit bitchy. We’ve all caught the ick before, it happens. The only difference is we arent trapped in a house and recorded 24/7 when it happens to us. 

As for Mike sending her home, it was clear Leanne deserved time to actually find romance, meanwhile Sophie was consistently saying she was riding out her time and would be with Conor when she left. It was a win-win for Mike, he got to send home the girl who pied him and keep a girl he was romantically interested in at that time. 

The people who were angry at Leanne
are the same fans who complain that Love Island doesn’t have the pettiness and drama it used to. 

People were so angry at her and really hated on her for how she handled things with Mike. But I think that the way she treated Mike was just a scapegoat behind pre-existing dislike they had no logical reason for before. Cuz in the history of shitty behavior on Love Island she ranked low but got a huge amount of backlash.

Its a bummer cuz in all her post show interviews (where she rooted for Mike and Priscilla, btw!) she seemed to have a really bright and memorable personalty and I also sense that if she had stuck around a little while longer she would have become a fan favorite."
LoveIslandTV,fprxguc,t1_fpr3c3c,1588863879.0,I think by no incentive they mean that Love Island contestants didnt have to worry that the literal dollar amount of what they could win would go down if they so much as kissed like it was on Too Hot To Handle.

LoveIslandTV,fpom7n8,t3_gem5uy,1588786845.0,"I think its a fantastic concept with horrible execution. Seemed like the creators were too focused on making Netflix their own version of Love Island and couldnt decide if the show was really about making the contestants form real connections or making them want to prematurely j*zz cuz theyre so horny and sex deprived.

The timing of the show was also awful. I could never tell if a couple days had passed or weeks had passed, showing us glimpses of challenges they did that never even aired. Seems like they made the show with the intention of airing many more episodes and then Netflix only gave them 8."
IsItBullshit,fpmrj47,t3_ge5lxp,1588739835.0,"I don't know enough to say concretely whether it's bullshit or not but this kind of question pertains to one of my favorite philosophies by Michael Foucault on the Panopticon prison (a circular prison design with a 360 degree officers booth at the center that prisoners cannot see inside of so they are unaware when they are being watched and thus act like they are always being watched) and how society now pretty much operates under that form of self discipline.

Rory thinks that because she left her grandparents house and returned to SH that she rejected that lifestyle but she just embraced it differently. Same thing with Jason Styles.

It’s fine to tan darker but its so obvious many of these women are making sure they tan darker than they might naturally in the sun in order to obtain that proximity to blackness. It’s one thing to tan darker after a day at the beach. Its another thing to spend hours in the tanning booth or spray tan to achieve that look. 

Or to use a foundation way darker than your natural skin tone. Look at love island. They spend all summer in the burning sun, baking away, and still wipe their faces of makeup off at the end of the night to reveal a much much paler face than their foundation is.

But in Love Island you get to know them on a daily basis and see their growth day to day because there is one new episode per day 6 days of the week that is just a day or two behind the actual filming. 

But here, maybe there are a couple days stacked into each episode? but probably more given that there are only 8 episodes and a full month is filmed. They don't have one episode per day in most other reality shows but you at least know when the sun has gone down and a new day has started.

And tbh... it kinda seemed like Charles was super content with doing all the work and made sure it was the way it was cuz he was such a micromanager and wanted to be able to do everything himself. 

So I don't feel sorry for either of them. They both seemed pretty content in that partnership and I think they thrived in it unlike a lot of the other teams.

He had a really clear vision that contributed to the teams success whereas Naresh and Julian's partners had nothing to offer them and they would drag each other down rather than the way Charles and Angelo (and the other teams) mostly lifted each other up."

AmItheAsshole,fon7mm3,t1_fokbkd7,1587913992.0,"You see your friends once a year vs her brother gets married (hopefully) once in a lifetime. 

Its not even just about you being there at the wedding to see it yourself. She was stuck taking care of your kids all day by herself and couldnt fully embrace the magic of watching her brother who she is clearly close with get married. For you to go on a trip that will happen again next year and happened the year before that."
RPDR_UK,fok5iyv,t1_fok4dt6,1587835784.0,no problem!! it's game changing. just be wary of the pop ups!
LiveFromNewYork,fojsd8t,t3_g7ur0u,1587828381.0,I liked it. Knowing that the snl cast/crew got a kick out of the jokes made them funnier to me.

AreYouTheOne,fojixez,t3_g7tga6,1587822140.0,"Lmaoooo this is a strange list. Paige has “done bad” by not handling a toxic breakup well? I haven’t seen her be offensive or hurtful. She just deleted twitter for a while and is a bit all over the place. 

And jennas offensive for joking about being pregnant? She really didnt say anything terribly offensive. Just silly. 

Also this makes out like these silly mistakes, it thats what we are to call them, are on the same caliber of problematic as the accusations of toxicity and weird relationships with young people remy has.

Im all for calling out problematic people when theyve done wrong but this is taking it a bit far. Theyre all imperfect human beings with emotions at the end of the day. 

We’re all bored, but this is too bored. Get a hobby."
ElvisDuranMorningShow,fojigkw,t1_foig4pz,1587821793.0,Maybe the podcast is something that brings her joy in such a dark time and she didnt want to put it off? Not much else she can do anyway. Its not like she could be in the hospital with him or be with family right now.
ElvisDuranMorningShow,fojidmx,t1_fojg8au,1587821729.0,Cuz she was on the show for a long time and was an integral member of the team for a good chunk of that time and it really hasnt been that long.
RPDRDRAMA,foi30lc,t1_fohicre,1587777680.0,Yup. Vixen isnt bringing up anything random or new. This has been a persistent issue in the beauty community for some time now. And a single tweet questioning the names is not nearly as dramatic as everyone in this thread is making it out to be.
RPDRDRAMA,foi2wb2,t3_g7hjl2,1587777611.0,"I dont see Vixen causing faux outrage and trying to get Alyssa cancelled or start a #AlyssaIsOver twitter trend. She is really just asking a fair question. 

Concerns with racist micro-aggressions embedded in shade names in beauty products has been an issue for a while now and Vixen is just pointing out how the ABH palette plays into that. 

Maybe the people complaining that we have bigger fish to fry should be concerned with the fact that they can’t think about more than one issue at a time."
LoveIslandTV,foi24ip,t3_g7dxxm,1587777162.0,"I mean probably but why wouldnt they? She was reality tv gold and they needed someone like her to stay in and stir things up. 

Love Island isnt some official election for best person of the year. People watch cuz its fun and dramatic and she always brought the drama. Even if it was really rigged in her favor, i personally dont mind. Season 5 would have been much more of a snoozefest without her."
GilmoreGirls,fohtd84,t1_foerbc1,1587772267.0,"I do agree with you there, the writing took a major hit in Season 7. But it wasn't really even up to snuff in season 6. Season 7 is certainly not my favorite, not by a longshot. But the character development feels more in line with where the series was heading in its earlier days. 

Honestly, the writing plus the new DP that lit the whole show way too bright made seasons 6 and 7 just feel like a CW teen drama."
GilmoreGirls,fohszmh,t1_fofof7i,1587772058.0,"I mean post-Luke finding out about April, the second half of season 6. He didn't enjoy being at Martha's Vineyard and whined about every little thing the entire time he was there, didn't think to get Lorelai anything for Valentine's Day, and it seemed like the work he did at the inn was more out of obligation than desire to make her happy because he liked seeing her happy (whereas before it seemed more like he did favors for her because he got satisfaction out of making her happy).

I think taking care of sick Paul Anka is a great example actually, shows such a stark difference between the way he was (caring and loving) versus how they wrote him to be at the end of the season. A stark transformation in such a short amount of time.

I'm not saying you have to be at someone's beck and call and do whatever they want to be a good romantic partner and make an effort. But in regards to the kind of effort Luke made for most of their relationship, it seemed like the writers tried too hard to make him seem careless and lazy."
GilmoreGirls,fohp1n6,t3_e6soup,1587769870.0,"My least favorite episode is the one where they go to Karaoke... its so cringy it hurts. One of my favorites is actually from Season 6, surprisingly - Friday Night's Alright for Fighting, just for the epic fight scene between Rory and Lorelai and the Gilmores."
TheTryGuys,fogfuev,t3_g77wfb,1587752042.0,Which one with the shrink? Is that a podcast ep or YT ep. id love to listen.
LoveIslandTV,fogeumn,t3_g7bk29,1587751674.0,"The drama he caused was fun but i didnt like him or root for him at all on the show. 

I dont think this opinion is that unpopular cuz i thought the consensus on this sub is that he was a jackhole on the show but handled losing his eye (and all the drama that ensued with Josh as a result) like a champ."
LoveIslandTV,fogcgfe,t1_foerr7t,1587750798.0,"I never said she had too much done. Just that, imo, she looks very different from what she looked like on the show."
AreYouTheOne,fodzj6v,t1_fodvyv6,1587693101.0,That's what I'm saying. Pretty upsetting that someone from OUT who is supposed to be a thoughtful voice for the community supports him and someone whose writing and thoughts I have otherwise respected and enjoyed supports Remy and outwardly seems to have no qualms.
LoveIslandAus,fodwsc5,t3_g6kq7q,1587691608.0,Onlyfans isnt always SW/adult entertainment but thats the content the platform is best known for.
LoveIslandAus,fodwe3w,t3_g6ieqs,1587691397.0,Lol was this a stoned idea? No shade. I get these ideas when I smoke and get all excited about sharing them with reddit.
trashy,fodw3zq,t3_g6pwx5,1587691239.0,He is lucky she is so nice I would have shoved him in the pool if he did that to me.
AreYouTheOne,fodvkm4,t3_g6vmdv,1587690946.0,"I used to really like him, he was one of my favorites when the season ended. Then paige came out and spoke her peace and I became wary, but took it with a grain of salt because it seemed very complicated and less straightforward than “he was the abuser and she was the victim.” But as time has passed, seeing how he initially responded to paige when she spoke out and wrote her off/deflected onto other issues, and how he has acted online since and how he was at the beginning (shamelessly talking shit about the whole S8 cast but now not wanting anyone to talk about him), seeing him now fully leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

He’s also been making jokes online since he’s dating a cis woman about how being gay is gross and other shit. I know they’re just jokes but bi people joking about those things when they are in cis-hetero relationships while overlooking the fact that they have a lot of privilege being in those relationships really, really irks me. 

I wish him well but its just another lesson for myself in how people with abusive tendencies are really good at wearing masks and getting people to like them. 

Seeing how many powerful people in the queer community adore him and have stood by him online (a couple bigwigs at Out, just to name a few) and see him still getting big jobs and bylines and attention is unsettling, to say the least."
LoveIslandTV,fodrpst,t3_g6wdr7,1587688879.0,"Montanas face is one of the most drastic changes from being on the show to modern day in my personal opinion. 

But yeah most people get work done once they leave show. I’m neither here nor there on dictating what is bad and unnecessary and what is good cuz its their faces, not mine. 


Not all of them do. Amber from S5 is still all natural. But ultimately, yeah most get at least some fillers.

If u dont mind other season spoilers (cuz they might list how she placed in the show) check out S5 Molly Mae before and after pics."
AmItheAsshole,fodiqqy,t3_g6ps43,1587685198.0,"NTA - Aside from all of the logical reasons why you are deserving to adopt him, when it comes down to it, the adoption is not about what you want or what Jill wants. Its about what Henry wants, who he feels the most comfortable with, and what is the best outcome for him. If him being with Jill would have been the best outcome for him he’d be calling her mom right now instead. Jill and those other friends clearly think that adopting is more about the family’s needs than the child’s, so to hell with them!"
TheTryGuys,fodgoc4,t1_fodcyju,1587684455.0,"I dont care. Why is it necessary to point it out? Who cares if it was unnecessary work, if he did get it done it was because he wanted to do it and didn’t ask for your opinion.

Like i said above, he’s been super vocal about he thinks he is ugly. Does pointing this out do anything to help the world or make it or eugenes life a brighter place? Youre just being needlessly cruel. Go focus on your own face."
NextInFashion,fod64le,t3_fybfqg,1587680543.0,"I went on a whole rant when the show first came out on this sub and to all of my friends that watched. I adored Alexa when I was younger but this show really exhibited that even though she’s been in the industry a long time she neither has the expertise nor open-mindedness/palette to judge all different kinds of styles. 

Just because both Tan and Alexa run or have run labels does not mean they have the depth to judge a competition like that. Honestly I think some of the contestants would have done a better job judging it. The both of them clearly had a bias for the british contestants and Alexa clear did not like a majority of the themes. 

There was also clearly a huge cognitive dissonance with their ability to judge clothing coming from cultures and styles they aren’t apart of and don’t have the capabilities to understand/appreciate (thinking of Kiki and Farai’s street style challenge design and Alexa’s repeated attacks on the “LA look”).

They should have just been hosts, and TBH that offer is too kind for them too cuz I didn’t find either of them to be all that witty/funny or their chemistry that great. 

It’s funny cuz I went into the show excited to see Alexa and still nostalgically adoring her/remembering the days where I wished I were here when I was a teen and left it hoping they replace her next season and embarrassed to say I was ever that big of a fan."
TheTryGuys,focxi5z,t1_focm5l4,1587677176.0,Yeah neither did I and I am pretty familiar with filler procedures and find them to be quite noticeable when celebs get them done so idk if that accusation is even true.
LiveFromNewYork,focx8fe,t1_focd2p2,1587677074.0,"Maybe. But hey! Its something to do. All of my friends that rag on me for adoring SNL and enjoying watching it live always joke that there are better things to do on a Saturday night. Now that theres truly nothing to do i feel like the show/ratings could thrive if the content is worth sticking around for (though thats always up in the air, isnt it). Im hoping they surprise us though and dont do anything stale."
LiveFromNewYork,foccb0z,t1_foc4mr5,1587669636.0,Why will ratings go down? I didnt think that the last episode was /that/ bad. I honestly enjoyed it and it was a breath of fresh air and a sense of normalcy amid all this madness. Not sure what people are expecting given the extremity of this entire situation.
BeautyGuruChatter,fobhvfs,t3_g6oxmu,1587659965.0,This is so kind. I just hope no one wrongfully takes advantage of this or scams the restaurants/christine.
BeautyGuruChatter,fobhqlq,t1_fob83pr,1587659920.0,"They dont always. My friends from uni work in ERs and units across NYC and all have crap pay and crap overtime. Even moreso, new doctors are still paying off pricey medical school degrees. 

I agree that thanks needs to be given to the service industry workers still working through this mess but not all healthcare workers are in excellent standing."
