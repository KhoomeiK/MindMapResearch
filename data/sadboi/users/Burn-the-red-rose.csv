But that's okay! I really just want it for when I go see the doctor and such, since I'm immunoconpromised and can't really get out often. But maybe in the future I can get some better ones when the world isn't eating itself alive. 😭But I'm definitely going to look at that site and the discount!

I could be wrong because it confused me too. 😂 But yeah, shopping around and reading reviews I saw a lot of girls talking about melting the lace, but I couldn't really find anything o youtube about it. The only thing I can think of is *heating* the lace a bit to make the outer edge (that I'm assuming been cut to fit the hairline) a bit softer. If that makes sense? Idk if that's even a thing, but that's the only thing I could think of? Anyways, thank you so much for your help!!!!! 💜💜"
Wigs,fpeigzh,t1_fpc1vk4,1588548184.0,"Okay, I might use glue cause it can get WINDY where I live and I'm paranoid. 😂 But cut it close. Got it. And the zig zag was more like a soft, wavy type way of cutting, following the hairline. I was bad at explaining that, sorry! As far as plucking, I do understand that. I'm a professional make up artist and face palm when people go straight to black eye shadow for ""smokey eyes"".  Ya can't take that back, sis lmao. I figured I'd pluck a bit to soften the hairline if needed, try it on, and rinse and repeat if needed. I know one of the wigs is going to need some plucking for sure. 
And dude. I have no idea what lace melting is about, but people keep talking about it????? If it isn't a worry, or part of needed care, I won't worry then. Thank you so much for your help!!!!💜"

(I am Jon Snow, I know nothing 😂) Or would the glue irritate? I have patch tested the glue with no reaction, and with this illness, I won't be wearing wigs unless I'm going to the doctor, or have to make a run to the store (very rare, my illness makes me very, VERY tired all the time) and slipping one on to play with make up and take selfies.

adhd_anxiety,f77fkd5,t3_dnzlqy,1573454429.0,"My mom is an herbalist, and when I was diagnosed she refused the doctor putting me on meds and chose herbs and certain foods to help. 

She never used CBD, (it wasn't a thing that I know of back then) but I've found it is incredibly useful. Otherwise, she made me take Vitamin B, and Magnesium Phosphate. (Mag Phos is really good for kids, because it's tiny pills to dissolve under the tongue and they taste sweet.) My mom gave the school nurse some Magnesium Phosphate, and if I was getting out of hand at school, my mom told my teachers to send me to the nurse for two tiny tablets. My teachers thankfully never abused this, and one even said ""She was a completely different child by the time she got back from the nurse's office than the child I sent out!"" So it works pretty fast. Honey is also good, and if you can get him to drink hot tea, there's a lot of calming teas that help that can be sweetened with honey. 

My mom would also give me different foods and work with my crazy mind to help me focus. Pineapple and cherries are good for calming. She would give me small activities like picking a bigger word out of a dictionary to use all week so I'd learn new and bigger words. She made sure I had plenty of exercise too, as well as catering as much as she could to changing interests when money was available. Baseball, gymnastics, acting, and so on.  It's not easy, and you'll both get frustrated, but it will be worth it as long as both you, your husband and your son all understand that this is a group effort, and you all want the same goal."

Also....having yogurt about keeps my husband calm. He worries about me a lot, and mostly due to the fear of my blood sugars slipping. I used to have to eat three meals a day, or my sugar a would slip. But after my seizure meds changed my whole diet (no carbs, sugar, diet soda, etc. My body didn't and doesn't crave it, save for once a month.) It seemed my blood sugars barely needed maintained. But, it helps him feel better, so we keep it around for that too."
