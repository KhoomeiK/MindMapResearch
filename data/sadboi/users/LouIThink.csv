Thing with that is, the future is so indeterminate and it's so hard to really know what you actually want.

socialanxiety,fq52ukg,t1_fq51ypv,1589090788.0,"God I used to be such a positive person. I think I am still, but just having to face the realities of life is rough. And yeah you're probably right about the overthinking bit. I'm glad I don't really feel the need to dull that impulse with drugs or other bad habits, but is honestly my biggest problem. Paralysis through analysis. Normal people who aren't all that self aware know how to get shit done, because their thought process is so much more concise and defined. I envy it a lot of the time, but I kinda wonder if I can become more productive despite the overthinking, if maybe I won't just be average, I'll be able to excel and go places most people wouldn't.

If you can, you should get a credit card asap and have at least 500 for the initial security deposit, and you'll be able to use that for food and other groceries and as long as you're paying it off, you can use it a just a little bit more financial power. Right now I'm living in a lil 2 room that's a little more than 1k a month and I have a lil more than 2k in savings and then a 3k credit line, so I'm using the credit card for whatever I can basically and between two jobs I have I'm able to keep paying it off and let my balance sit at around 500. Instead of getting fast food I'm mostly just eating combinations of rice beans and any other vegetables or sausage shit I find at Rancho and I think at most I should be spending like 300 on food monthly, so I basically don't have anything to worry about. Honestly as long as you have credit and a decent job that you can make a thousand or so a month at, it's not that hard at all to live pretty well. In the first month or two you'll have to probably not put too much into like just furniture and shit you want, but after paying dumbass security deposits and all that, you can save up a pre good amount of money for savings and like Gucci couches n shit."

Sometimes you kinda forget that you're ""different,"" and just get used to being treated more or less the same as other people, then you get into a situation like that and realize that even with all the progress we've made, some people will still want to treat you different because of your race.
