It truly baffles me how people, and I’m not just talking about this person, can completely ignore Jesus’s core message of loving thy neighbor. That’s the whole bible! There are no fucking conditions. Jesus doesn’t say “only love employed straight white Americans who don’t need any help”."

SquaredCircle,fp01aor,t1_fozxgig,1588200617.0,I mean if it makes the dude happy I guess it’s cool 🤷‍♀️. I think face tattoos are generally dumb especially when that guy had all of his arms and legs untattooed. He could have gotten that anywhere else.
