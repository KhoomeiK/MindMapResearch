relationship_advice,fpuy4a2,t3_gfomkj,1588927852.0,"Hi there my friend. I read the whole post. I feel worried about how he is treating you. Actually I don‚Äôt like it at all. As to what are his reasons and why he is doing this, it could be a mixture of factors and not only his new friends group which I really dislike the way they are behaving. You sound like the better person in this relation and comparing to your friend you are actually the good one ( in many ways ) , I am not saying he is a bad guy but I am sure he is the looser if this friendship ended. I would like you to try to create new friends. He is one of many people that you know around you. As to telling others your secretes, from personal experience its a big no-no unless it is told to professional ( which you did not mention if you are under therapy or not, if you are not please seek treatment it helps a lot) as it might come back one day and bite you. Now regarding your friend, I suggest that you let it fade slowly and not cut it off abruptly because in addition to your good past together he sounds like the reckless crazy type. I am sure that it will be difficult in the beginning but it will pass and eventually you will be stronger. You are young and smart and you still have your whole future in front of you to live and achieve your potential. Best of luck. 
Edit : i corrected some grammar and added some points."

relationship_advice,fpjcqjx,t3_gdsy0m,1588663801.0,"My dear , I salute you for being a great mom and a great person as a whole by not taking advantage of this guy. Remember that you had your load of painful experience and I don‚Äôt blame you for being cautious and skeptical. You did not state how many years you have been dating prior to him hinting to move in. I am not sure what you are worried about most, is it the feeling of rush or the absence of passion on your side or the fear of not working out ? If you feel its too early, then there is no harm of delaying it a bit more and be frank with him. If you are wondering why there is no passion, will I think you are in an age phase that is more mature with feeling than being a temporary flair up. If you are afraid it wont work, will you never know unless you go for it. From what you described your boyfriend he seems like a good guy. One that is looking for settling down and a steady mature relationship. I hope you can make the right decision. Good luck üå∑"

He couldn‚Äôt enroll in college and had many family problems at the time and was worried and scared about the future. He was in his lowest point and I think he cried his self to sleep.

The figure was wearing his PJs. He looked for a second and before my husband could say anything he disappeared and the PJs dropped on the floor.
