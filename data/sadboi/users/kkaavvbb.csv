It sounds like you’ll be fine, as long as you did work last year, at minimum. 

And yes, you’ll basically go to certify your weekly benefits, it’ll ask you your PUA reason (mine is I have to take care of a child since school is closed and also I am a contractor out of work). Then you’ll certify for each week it’ll let you (should let you certify all the way to when you first applied). Answer the questions exactly as they tell you to. 

There isn’t any explanations or anything due yet, or at least haven’t been requested for me as of yet. So you won’t need any typing out reasons why you are not working. Just click the yes/no buttons, as they tell you to answer."

I’m on PUA, but I also work a part time job, which I had a week of no work during Passover, so I was able to claim for 2 weeks then it became unpayable (as I had worked during the first 2 weeks and not during the 3), so it flagged. I’ve since certified every week (it says it will be credited to me when it’s looked at), and this past week they let my claim go through. I did get the unemployment $$ but waiting to see if the $600 will start back up.

However, I cannot reopen my claim to fix, as they requested I do that - it just makes me go in circles and I can’t get anywhere. 

Did you just, on a whim, send in your paystubs to the office or were you instructed somewhere to do that? I’m just curious if I should write a letter to the office and it would be more beneficial than sending emails. I pretty much refuse to call more than once a day."

So, maybe the blood pressure meds have helped some or it’s just I’m not in the service (waitressing) industry anymore that it’s not so noticeable to people anymore. Last I researched it was a few years ago, so I wasn’t aware of the option of trying propranolol.

Here is the c&p of the email 

“Your claim is now eligible for payment of Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA).

You are also eligible for an additional $600 per week through Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC).

On Friday, May 1, the first day to certify for your benefits, please carefully follow the instructions below. There are multiple steps you will need to complete in one sitting. One set of questions will ask about your coronavirus-related need for unemployment assistance. A second set of questions certifies your weekly employment situation.

Answering these weekly certification questions differently than described in the instructions will delay payment.

Review the coronavirus-specific instructions on how to answer the questions to certify for your benefits. Print out these instructions or keep the webpage open as you certify.
Locate the exact time on Friday, May 1 that you are permitted to access the certifying system.
Login　at your specific time on Friday, May 1. The process must be completed all at once.
Answer the questions on the PUA Self-Certification Page about your coronavirus-related situation.
Review the instructions for certification for benefits. Again, print out these instructions or keep the webpage open as you certify.
Answer the certifying questions. Submit.
If the ""Claim Additional Week"" button appears in the center-bottom of screen, click the button and complete a certification　for each week available on your claim. There may be multiple weeks available to you, which would allow you to receive multiple weeks of benefits.
Continue to click on ""Claim Additional Week"" until that button no longer appears after answering the certifying questions.
If you certify for benefits on May 1, you will receive payment on Tuesday, May 5 and, on the same day, receive the Pandemic Unemployment Compensation of $600 per week for each week you certified.

If you miss your scheduled certification time window on May 1, you will be able to certify on Saturday, May 2, in the time slot specified for your Social Security number. Please note that if you certify Saturday, May 2, you will not receive the Pandemic Unemployment Compensation of $600 per week for each week you certified until May 12.

Three tips to ensure timely payment:　

Certify this Friday.　
Answer the questions according to the instructions.　
Certify for each week available to your claim.

UpliftingNews,fot3irv,t1_fosoyjb,1588043831.0,"I don’t have terrible teeth. Just some odd nooks that I guess normal teeth don’t have. Plus, I’ve always had a yellow tint to my teeth, no matter what (white-teeth folk, I ENVY you!!!). 

I’m not sure how sickly I was before 1. I do know I was hospitalized after birth for awhile due to heart/lung issues and I had lots of high fevers as a child (103+ F). I’m 31 in a week and my “high fevers” can get up to 106, so it’s not unreasonable to think I got up to 103 or higher as a child. I know in my teens I got up to 105. 

I was strictly told my issues were very probable due to high fevers as a kid. It’s just so weird! 

I wore braces for 6 years and have a permanent bottom retainer, so most my teeth will stay straight. But there’s more than just straight teeth! Teeth are just one of those things you hope to god they work out well and you get the good genes. (And I got the good genes!! lol). 

Ugh. Good luck to your one kiddo. Teeth stuff give me nightmares"

UpliftingNews,fosdl3c,t1_formwif,1588028628.0,"Weird. My dentist told me my teeth/enamel issues were likely due to high fevers as a child. 

Idk who to believe now. I mean, adult teeth are still growing and forming during childhood, aren’t they?"

My dads turning 57 the day after I turn 31 and my grandpa is getting older the day after that!! My younger brother is turning 30 on the 18th! And his wife is idk how old at the 15!! 

I’m SOO looking forward to celebrating with all them afterwards!! I might be able to travel and visit them (as they all live 750+ miles away) after this!! And my SIL is due In July!! Which is super sweet cause our (departed) grandmothers birthday is July 22 and my moms is July 11! We’re looking forward to a lot of fun this summer and I haven’t seen my dad or brother and SIL for 2 years now!! Thank you for the giveaway!!"
LifeProTips,fol42nh,t1_fokw09l,1587854480.0,"lol first time I let my kid pour her own milk, it was all over. But whatever, it’s a mess than can be cleaned. 

I let her crack an egg and ended up with the broken eggshell and all in the bowl.

She gets certain duties when we cook now. But it’s just messes anyway. Cooking and baking is messy anyway!

She loves making homemade pizza dough (and the pizza) though! Super fun!"

newjersey,foikdno,t1_foijso7,1587788854.0,"Mine, who I’ve been working with since March, has been ok. 

I’ve lived here 6 years now and my lease is up to expire / release. They’re putting me on a payment plan which includes 1/2 down (830$) and they’ll add the remaining to next 3 months rent. 

Which doesn’t help in the long run if I don’t get the PUA (I’m a contractor). Not to mention, my deposit was 500$ down. So, even if I applied my deposit, or could, it wouldn’t help! 

I rent from a company, not a singular landlord. But still. 

It’s not really all that helpful, to be honest.

Edited : and I’m not even sure if my deposit is good at this point. I’ve been here 5+ years, so they’re gonna replace the carpet and repaint and everything when I finally move anyway!"
NoStupidQuestions,foij7wh,t1_foiiodb,1587787993.0,"Well yea. But knowing most amazon delivery folks, they’re on such a high demand industry right now. Idk. 

Would a bright orange paper work better? Or a paper with an arrow pointing “drop it off there” or just “don’t knock”? 

I don’t do deliveries so idk what would catch their attention. This is why I’m asking :("

newjersey,foif9ig,t1_foidh3u,1587785281.0,"This, unfortunately.

My neighbor went to walk a reservoir with her dog. She encountered lots of groups together that were not social distancing, spoke to each other as if they hadn’t seen each other in awhile and disregarded other people in social distancing. 

It sucks but ... well, here we are. 

We can’t have nice things cause people disregard rules because they think they’re special."

I know the extra 600 is till July (or end of?).

Unfortunately, I’m a contractor in NJ and still waiting for Murphy to release the PUA funds so I can pay bills :("
