AS is still quite new for me 10months diagnosis, been on DMARDs,stopped due to bloods, then got moved onto Biological therapy Amgevita/Humira. 
Was going quite well but developed a new leg nerve pain which has resulted in that medication being stopped also. So now am back in limbo land.
The fatigue that you mentioned can be so debilitating that many have no idea what it's like. Been worn out from Daily Living Activites is not normal and we often beat our selves up that it exhausts when we just need to accept that we need a rest.
I hope your confidence and strength returns to you soon. You have come through so much so far, keep fighting for yourself."

I recently came out of a very, how do I put it, unusual relationship where she knew I was with a guy but it was secret due to him being deliberately secret about himself which was fine but it affected the relationship obviously and its something I felt I hide from them through the circumstances which I didn't like in hindsight"

Currently 29 M, AS on Amgevita but injection has been stopped just this week to investigate a new pain/ sensation in my leg which they are currently referring to as 'altered sensation. 
Classic symptoms of Lowe back pain, peripheral pain in hands in feet when my pain levels are high. Stiffness especially morning time and as the Day goes on.

I cant believe I have just said that as it's the exact reason and thing imim mad at my Mental Health team mad at!
Your young, you may have this diagnosis but it might not matter so much to you when your older. That does not Imply you will simply grow out of it that's highly ignorant and condescending. What I mean is you make not think about it as much you want feel it so intensely later on?
I'm 29 and probably have always been dealing with it as long a ls I can remember, in some  form..

Yes Humira, adalimumab,  the injection pen that was mentioned.
I initially started on Disease Modifying Anti Rhuemo Drug - sulfasalazine and was working up to the Dose, every week then hit a Neutropina so had to stop it immediately...
Now I'm on Humira injections 2x fortnightly but just encountered a new leg pain they are calling altered sensations and they want me to stop Humira now..
Trial n error I suppose...

Hope your pharmacy visit goes well, ask questions even if you feel they are rushed, you deserve too have the chance to understand what your meds are ll about:)"

I think I read somewhere about a possible link between autoimmune diseases and mental health conditions like BPD but it suggested it was in its infancy n needed more research.

I find now though my mood to be so low at times, and a sense of helplessness despite every effort I put in to being positive and trying to not dwell on my negative thoughts...

Is there a friend or co worker anyone you could speak to about some of the things on your mind.

ankylosingspondylitis,f7mdg9g,t3_dwyoo5,1573860346.0,"Hi this must be stressful...

But a positive Result for HLAB27 is not an automatic pre requestie of diagnosis for Anklyosing Sponylarthitis..
It can be used in the evidence for AS diagnosis is my understanding..
It sounds like some imaging work like an MRI may be helpful for you, are you still under a Rhuemo?
I'm not medically qualified or that but I have just went through the investigations etc, MRI blood work etc 
Diagnosis of AS. Male 29, symptoms where actually hand n feet pain and lower back ppus buttock pain when it was most severe..
On a biological treatment now and would be lost without my pain killers, I'm also pretty active but sometimes it doesnt feel like it keeps it at bay at all n then other days moving so much is the best therapy...
It's interesting you note your lower back pain does improve with rest which I suspect is atypical especially if your considering that it feels like some kind of arthritic condition  in your back/spine area? 
Hope you get some answers and your pain eases"

I can relate cause I have been going through some issues similar... I think with BPD what is very difficult for the person living with it and others around them is the distance you feel from yourself as an individual the constant, constant disputes you have mentally about who you are as a person, your identity and your purpose....

I recently saw my GP who referred me to my Mental health team and I am seeing a Advanced practitioner Mental Health Nurse, she is putting me forward for a 10 week therapy course.. 

Have you ever tried therapy or anything like it? 
I know you feel these pains but there is Hope, j believe you can find yourself and start to work on some things that are causing you distress..

ankylosingspondylitis,f6qr0ok,t3_dsmwqf,1573083732.0,"So my understanding is Ankylosing Sponylarthitis affects the spine so that's any where onnyou spine that has inflammation means it's probably AS.
OA is that Osetoarthritis you refer too? That I dont know much about I'm afraid.
Not sure what DDD means either. 
Sponylosis is defined as changes in the spine, I googled it, so I guess that can refer to physical changes like in the discs and bone structure where as Sponylarthritis is, inflammation of the spine,  ISIS usually denotes inflammation..
Have they mentioned actually mentioned these conditions co existing...
I think it's not completely un fathmabole that if you have one type of change within your Spine your likely to have some more for loads of reasons like the fact your experiencing a change physically and lymphatically like in your SI joints...
I have AS and recently diagnosed and that's where they said the inflammation was occurring but also forewarend me that possibly I may see bone formation in places that usually bones dont grow in the spine...
Hope that helps a bit?
Take care :)"

I had this label thrown at me nearly ten years ago and I wasnt ready to face it so I hide away from it but now I'm ready to accept it... although saying that there are times I dont think it fits me so well. I know that can be a classic sign of BPD but hey cant be perfect.

I engage in similar things like control of my diet and health is a big thing for me. 

So far this therapist sees much more down to earth than my previous psychiatrist, although my mind is alot clearer than it was back when I saw the first one...
Anyways I hope things will get better because it's quite a struggle at times, no one seems to get what it's like and they dont understand why I react to things the way I do, although they rarely say anything I can feel it and I wish they would talk to me about it, you cant work on something if you dont know it's an issue you know,  it for them  but for yourself.

Your right though, we are who we are and we shouldn't be so hard on ourselves, we just find things more intense and in a way it should be celebrated not chastised. But hey mainstream, is so mainstream do you really want to be in it anyway, I know I definitely don't I have always serectly wanted to be not normal, normal feels so boring?"

I am not a doctor but it does sound like you have some traits of the condition.

I am currently going through some therapy and I'm due to start a 10 week course of therapy early next year...
My Advance Practioner Nurse says I dont meet the criteria for the full diagnosis, and I should be grateful for it, but they dont seem to get the not knowing is actually so frustrating.

Anyways you do sounds like you have worked on a ton of stuff you have went through so well done for that.
I'd definitely seek some help though even if it's just to talk things through I know mental health services can be stretched regardless of where you live but it's worth it..today for example I had an appointment and wasnt even sure what we would discuss and I came out with my heart exposed only realising that I'd been carrying around this baggage for nearly 10 years ?
