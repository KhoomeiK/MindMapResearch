My Nmom slammed my head into a concrete wall a few times when I was about 13 and one of my biggest regrets looking back on that situation 15 years later is that I never told anyone about it. I could have easily gotten her arrested, I could have gotten fed because she wasn't feeding me, I could have gotten clean because she wasn't providing the basics. I could have gotten her out of my life much earlier than I was actually able to. There are people out there that are ready and willing to help you. Use all of those people and resources.

Michigents,f7bkrrd,t3_dudlzg,1573571448.0,"Depends what field you’re going into and the business itself. 

For example, lots of drug testing done in the medical field. Some hospital systems won’t even let you have nicotine in your system and will do random checks. At the same time there’s small, private offices who didn’t want to waste the money drug testing us. 

I just got a new job and the job ad stated we’d have a background and drug test. A week in I asked another employee about if it was gonna happen and she nearly cried from laughing so hard. 

I think for a while it will be hit and miss. I was totally prepared to fail a drug test if a company required one to hire me in.

bipolar,ex101pu,t1_ew1cfo3,1565926655.0,"So, your experience was really similar to mine. I had a bit of depression and chronic pain before. Dr. gave me Celexa. Didn't help. Gave my Cymbalta because it's also used for pain. Terrible drug. It was a very, very hard medicine to come off of. They switched me to zoloft, which turned me into a zombie and gained a lot of weight, but I was able to function. Eventually I gained too much weight and they switched me to Effexor. It wasn't helping so they doubled my dosage. Then BAM mania! I had never felt that good in my entire life. Turns out anti-depressants trigger bipolar episodes as you've found out. anti depressants are not the way to go with bipolar disorder. 

Long story short, you're probably going to need to need to be in therapy and on medication long term, and that's OKAY!! I recommend looking into DBT programs. It's not about the diagnosis, it's about getting you the treatment you need. There is absolutely no shame in being bipolar. With the right help, you can live a normal life. I struggled with my diagnosis. I went through denial, anger, grief, fear, etc. The most important thing to remember is that it's not about the diagnosis. It's about feeling good enough to be your authentic self.

As far as medications go it's a roller coaster. You're likely going to need a cocktail of a few medications and that's normal. It takes time and a lot of trial and error but you CAN get there. Be your own advocate. 

Bipolar disorder has some comorbities like ADHD. So for example, Seroquel can make it easier for some to fall asleep and yes, groginess is going to happen. But if you do happen to also have ADHD, which a lot of us do, they might give you something like Adderall or Vyvanse as a stimulant to help the sleepiness while also helping ADHD symptoms. If you deal with anxiety they may add an anti anxiety. If you can't sleep they may give you a sleeping medication. 

Having said that anti depressants aren't part of the recommend treatment plan. Treatment plan shpuld be mood stabilizers and anti psychotics. The goal of medication in bipolar patients is to stabilize their mood. If their mood can be stabilized with mood stabilizers and anti psychotics, there is no need for an anti depressant that could throw you into a manic state. 

I've finally seem to have found a good cocktail with minimal side effects. I also have c-ptsd, bpd, anxiety, adhd, and insomnia. 
-Lamictal 325 mg once daily (mood stabilizer)
-Focalin 10 mg once daily (stimulant)
-Klonopin 1-2mg once daily
-Seroquel XR 100 mg once daily

I've tried: 
-anti depressants: Celexa, Zoloft, Effexor, Prozac, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin 
-mood stabilizers/anti psychotic: Abilify, Risperdal, Lamictal, Gabapentin, Latuda, Rexulti, Seroquel
-anti anxiety: xanax, klonopin, ativan

Side effects for Lamictal were very, very minimal. Seroquel is a tough one but you get used to it. It can make you groggy, but my psychiatrist says that she has many patients on it that it does not make sleepy. I've taken it in the morning too and have been okay. Seroquel definitely did put weight on, but I'm a lazy pos and eat like garbage. I was able to lose the weight when I was on Vyvanse but that's a different story. It causes weight gain, but if you take care of yourself you will be okay. I usually get hungry for a little bit afterwards. I get a midnight snack in. Sometimes a tiny snack hits the spot, sometimes I eat a lot. I tend to binge eat without it anyways. 

TLDR kinda: don't focus on diagnosis. Focus on treatment. Treatment is hard, but definitely not impossible. Seroquel can be a tough medicine but don't be afraid. It works. Just take care of yourself. Perhaps ask for an anti anxiety medicine. Be your own advocate, do your research. Also, seeing a therapist consistently and finding a therapy and sef care routine is essential. Good therapist and psychiatrists are hard to find. Don't be afraid to search until you find a match.

I've started taking it around 9:30 pm and definitely feel better. I've been experiencing these mood swings in the morning now too. 

I was wondering if anyone takes it during the day or in the morning. 

I also deal with chronic pain and fatigue so I'm always tired anyways. Pdoc wants me to eventually come off some of my meds because I'm on so many. She even suggested taking me off my Prozac soon because anti depressants haven't been very effective for me...ever. I've tried them all."
