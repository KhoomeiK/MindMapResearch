Watches,fpv7zmc,t3_gfrhff,1588937940.0,"What can I say? Many people had mentioned their perfect quarantine watch and this is mine. Yes, it is a Tevise, and yes, the motive can be seen as childish. As teenage angst. Or it can be seen as a visual representation to remember your own mortality, which has long-standing philosophical roots, including in Bhutan and ancient China. 

Or you can ignore all of that and just enjoy the deep dial, the handwinding movement,  the stimmy case texture on the sides, the lume, which while this is a Tevise and their lume never is there for a long time, is in this case there for a good time as the skull lights up as well as the hands and indices. I really wanted the black watch not the rose gold one but it was out of stock and in retrospect, I have to say that it feels less angsty and more serene."

Watches,fpq1htd,t3_gewipf,1588813293.0,"I was wearing a Tevise watch when I was lounging at home waiting for the Corona-virus triage. That was when I received the call that the defense forces would organize the transport to the testing hub (the clerks at the hub were not happy when my reply to their question on transportation was ""Dublin Bus is still running, right?""). So, I decided to instead put on a Vostok instead of my Tevise (which I mentioned here in a post called ""I have 5 bucks but I feel like a million""). 

What can I say? I like blue, I like green, I love teal, so this watch really tickles my fancy. I am especially partial to the numbers… that 4 looks really nice. I ordered this watch before Corona hit Ireland and none of the people I know IRLhas seen it yet."
