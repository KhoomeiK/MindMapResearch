They participated in substance harm reduction by allowing me and my friends to drink in their house as this allowed them to watch over us and keep talley of what we where drinking. If they didn’t we would have found other ways to get messed up possibly leading to drug use. They have remained married although I’m conscious of their struggles in the past. Finally, they taught me to do the right thing even when it may not reward as well as doing the wrong thing. My father taught me this through his action of denying a big promotion in the military because he refused to hate gay relationships in the military. He said he didn’t care if a man or woman was gay and was dismissed from his promotional review afterwards.(this was the 90’s)"

I assumed after the military I should be grateful for what ever job I get and ended up working in a ship yard with a group of criminals who abused drugs on the job. I nearly got killed twice. After my second near death experience due to drugged up work colleagues I took the plunge and and applied to a community college. 4 years later I’m in my final year as an undergrad with a 4.0 GPA. I’m also considering getting my masters next year after graduation. Don’t let negativity eat away and control you. Humans are incredibly adaptable creatures that can overcome the impossible."

After some chit chat my dad quickly  returned to the police van for some reason. When he returned to speak to the motorcyclist there was nobody there. My dad looked around, listened for the noise of a motor, footsteps, but there was nothing. It seemed that in the 20 seconds he had popped to the van the motorcyclist and his bike had vanished. My dad called out for a bit Incase he and the bike had relocated somewhere out of site, but it quickly dawned on my father that he was on a country road and there was nowhere for the motorcyclist to disappear to that quickly with a heavy bike. My dad said he freaked the hell out and got in the van and left quickly. He said the weirdest part was that he physically touched the guy and the bike. Few days later after mentioning it to a colleague it turned out that a biker a few years prior was killed in that spot in a traffic accident and that he’s not the first to mention such an incident. He hates talking about it still today."

raleigh,fn2lckr,t3_fyq91s,1586593305.0,"I’m sorry you’re struggling. It’s horrible not being able to relax in your own home. We live on a top floor apartment with a child, and I have made a point to go out my way and speak to our neighbors about noise. I let them know they should feel comfortable about approaching me anytime if we make too much of a racket and they replied positively with the same approach on their end. I really think it’s important to try and live as a community in a way that respects everyone’s lifestyle when living in such close proximity. 

My only unsolicited advice to people who struggle with apartment noise is in the future try to rent a top floor apartment that sits next to a fire escape or elevator. It’s usually a little more money, but cuts down the possibility of at least one noisy neighbor living next to you and any living above you. Finally, I avoid facing or living above any type of communal courtyard as these often house parties and gatherings.

I’m sorry I cant offer any quick advice to combat this issue. These are strange times. Hold it together.. you got it!"
