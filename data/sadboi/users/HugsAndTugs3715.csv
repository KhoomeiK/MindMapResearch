cults,fjgk5pc,t1_fjggyte,1583328904.0,"Yeah I have thought about that, but I’m probably too unattractive at this point in my life to be a sex worker. Wish I would have had the guts to try it out 10 years ago"
Parenting,fgkr0rp,t1_fgknlf1,1580871689.0,"My mom is a huge help, and my daughter adores her grandma, but as selfish as it sounds it never seems like it helps. I’ve definitely isolated myself from friends over the last few years, and when I get an opportunity for some “me” time I usually just run errands kid free. Which is awesome but I find myself losing it in the day to day tasks - getting us ready for work/school, bedtime routines, preparing/eating meals. Like I said, she’s a pretty good kid, but I just constantly feel physically and emotionally drained from the day to day tasks and find myself just snapping at simple questions or normal kid talk, like I mentioned above. And I feel horrible for it."
Parenting,fgkqdtl,t1_fgkptz1,1580871294.0,"I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. I had severe PPD after my daughter was born and was actively in therapy and on different meds. Things got better, for a time. But I feel like I have consistently been on a roller coaster my entire life, and motherhood honestly makes it worse/more difficult. I don’t want to be an angry/depressed/mean mother. I know she deserves way better. But I don’t know how to change it. But thank you for your kind words."

SuicideWatch,fgkn5uj,t3_eyjkyc,1580869352.0,"I definitely know the feeling. I have no wise words of advice because I’m still going through it. I just hope you find something to smile about today, no matter how small it may be."
adderall,fgkdf7j,t3_eymv9m,1580862980.0,"I had a similar problem with Vyvanse. I was taking 30 mg in the morning (around 8 or 9) and noticing a huge crash at about 3, when I’m typically on my way to my second job. My doctor prescribed me an additional 20 mg to take around 1 and it has helped tremendously. It has never messed with my sleep. Would your doctor do this for you? It’s definitely worth asking about!"
SuicideWatch,fge9wd4,t1_fge8s54,1580694722.0,I’m sorry you’re dealing with this as well. It’s a horrible dilemma.
