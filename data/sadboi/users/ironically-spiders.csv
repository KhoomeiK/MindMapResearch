There was also no clear system for how the assigned spots vs the guest spots were placed. Someone had parked in the guest spot I usually used (my husband at the time used the numbered spot), so I had to figure out where to park. I thought I was good when I parked. I found out that it was not a guest spot I took, it was a numbered, but I literally could not see the numbers since it was after 10pm and snowing. I found this out because our neighbor's wife had me towed that night before I got up to go to work. They both knew what my car was, and we had had a great relationship prior, but I suppose they decided much like you that it was tow worthy. They can fuck right off. It was one night and one mistake.

I pooped myself many times out of fear and trying to tough it out like they always pushed, and hid my underwear. They always found them and never said anything.

AmItheAsshole,fp3l566,t1_fp1fe3a,1588281227.0,"That opens the door for more issues. Let's put it like this, because I face this exact issue as a dog groomer! Someone calls and wants to get a quote to get their dog groomed. I ask what kind of dog it is. If I'm lucky, they know the exact breed, so I can give a range of what it should be assuming no surprises. (""For a shih tzu, you're looking at *probably* 45-50, that would include bath, nails, ear cleaning, and haircut. That price could change when we see the dog, of course, but that's our best estimate at the moment"") Now, here's where that lucky situation becomes complicated. The dog is actually mixed, or maybe poorly bred, and so the coat isn't at all the breed standard (which factors into the price). Maybe the dog is also much larger than breed standard. (Shih tzus are usually ~20lbs ish, but we have a few poorly bred ones that are close to 40lbs, thats a BIG difference) Size changes of course change the time required. Maybe the dog is morbidly obese and can't stand very long, so either I hurt my back constantly holding it up or I have to work around it best I can, also taking longer. Maybe the dog is matted, this requires a lot of extra time and care to get that off. Maybe it has fleas and needs a flea bath soak and must be done straight through to prevent a flea outbreak in the salon. Maybe it's aggressive. Maybe it's a fear pooper, so regular stopping to clean up and hopefully not need to rebathe it. Maybe it has a health issue that needs to be worked around. I don't mind doing any of these things, but what was a ""perfect"" situation of someone knowing their dog breed can go completely wrong with ease. When you throw in mixed breeds, the variables become more extreme. Those cases can mean a wider range, but more often, we end up saying ""Without seeing the dog, I'm going to say *starting at* $x, but I can't tell you more accurately for certain until we see the dog"". 

Consider things like tattoos. Most places won't give estimates over the phone, because they have too many variables too, and don't want that held over their head. A client could mean well, but maybe not know jack shit about what's actually going on, so giving an estimate is generally a bad idea. Too often ""BUT YOU SAID IT WAS $X!"" Even when you say it's an estimate, too often you still get pushback like that (I know I do as a groomer, even with my careful wording). They didn't know if they'd be walking into a dumpster fire that OP either left out or didn't know, so best to not chance it at all."

When my dad asked if I got them, my boyfriend responded that I did and that if they knew me *at all* they would know that they were in some of my least favorite colors (and everyone in my life knows how much I love purple, it's just one of my things) and not my style at all or any colors I liked or flowers I liked. My dad responded that he asked the florist to ""pick out something nice"". Not only did he not know anything about me, but he couldn't be bothered to *try*.

It sounds like she is using the whole body positivity, for lack of a better word, to cover some insecurities. It reads very forced and something she is avoiding addressing to cover her own mental hang ups. 

Couples counselling would also be something I would suggest. They can help you both communicate the issue (and maybe others) in ways that are healthy and effective. This will allow you to be blunt with the therapist guiding the conversation about why this is important to you and not a personal attack. My ex would just complain about my weight gain to the point of me developing an eating disorder. Once I was able to start recovering from that, I put on a lot of weight. My relationship with food was still very unhealthy. My SO now helped communicate with me (after many failed and I imagine frustrating attempts) that he supported my weight loss journey and helped get me through the beginning, the hardest part, and then any hiccups along the way. He celebrated my successes and didn't make me feel like trash during failures. 

One last thing I want to address: I have lost 53lbs since July 1 last year (I hit that point March 23, actually. Have been so busy with dealing with recent events that I haven't been weighing myself). So about 9 months. If she really puts forward an effort, she can do it too.

Anything I do with him is more special than anything else, because I have never loved anybody nearly as much as I do him.""
This is why the concept of virginity is an issue. The idea of sex with only one person ever being superior than if any partner has had sex before them is silly. Superior sex is superior sex. Quantity doesn't matter, quality does. The value resides in that and how special it is to an individual isn't *because* of a number, but how they feel about the partner.

""he's said he would have loved me more if I was a virgin""
What the fuck. YOU DON'T SAY THIS TO PEOPLE WUT

""He's also said he will be happier with his next partner even if she's had sex before, because 'neither of them would be more special to the other'""
Firstly, see my first point. But second, DUDE. He is actively planning on a next partner and saying they WILL be better because of this. That doesn't even make sense. 

""He sometimes even says I do not deserve forever with him because of my sexual past, and is apparently disgusted by it.""
Well that right there is bitter, resentful, and tbh emotionally abusive to say to a partner.

""how do I cope with losing him over such a juvenile thing?""
You move on to a partner who respects and loves you and doesn't care how many people you've been with, you live your life happily, knowing you are a better person and less bitter and angry than him.

""he revealed that he was actually a virgin before me and was lying to make himself feel better""
Girl, he probably is lying about lying. He is using the whole virginity thing to control and shame you. Your points about how quickly you slept together vs why he didn't with longer relationships points to this. And you say it yourself: he is using it as a control tactic. 

You know the answer here: GTFO. He doesn't deserve you, and you have no reason to be ashamed. He doesn't respect you and is being abusive and hateful."

AmItheAsshole,fm63k6n,t1_fm5tyno,1585785537.0,"It's already been said but I will echo it for my two cents: Breasts are not sex organs whereas penises are. 

Your's are sexually stimulating, for many they aren't. But there are tons of people turned on by I think every single body part, but we don't completely cover every square inch because some folks find it erotic. I have seen many men with breasts larger than my own. 

And like you said, breastfeeding isn't sexual, and not only are you legally allowed to breastfeed in public, but you can do so without being covered (which many women prefer for a number of reasons). Take a flat chested woman, one who isn't really curvy at all, then a man who happens to get fat in those places. I think we all know people who fall into each of those categories. Cover their genitalia and faces. Remove body hair, because many women can have a lot, and many men can have little, so let's even the playing field. Or, if you prefer, let's make sure the woman in question is one with a lot of body hair and the man one who prefers to shave it all off. Can you tell inherently which is which? No. They don't have to be sexual. 

Frankly, I see no real problem going full tits out at home if you want (or wearing bras all the time if you want). OP is at home, even if it is with other people. And she had them fully covered. She wasn't having them hang out or ""be sexy"" in any way beyond existing, and as such, should be of no offense to anyone at home. 

I think if we want to include penises in the conversation for equivalency (which, well, see above), it would be like a guy opting for sweatpants and no boxers underneath. He's not letting it all hang out, he's covered, he just exists with a penis and isn't opting for modest garments in his home.

I saw a thing a while back, and its been quoted a lot, that more or less said that some women feel empowered dressing provocatively and other feel empowered covering up. Neither is inherently wrong."
