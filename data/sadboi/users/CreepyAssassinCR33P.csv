Be a better/more respectable person. Be nice to people, but not at your own expense. And always have something productive or fun but important stuff to do, so that your time will be more valuable to you, and you won't be wasting it bending over for others.

Then FI came, listened to descending and invincible, didn't like em that much, listened to FI (track) and then slowly got into it.

Now repeatedly listening to 7empest and Invincible."
