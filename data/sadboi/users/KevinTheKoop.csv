If you draw on a C a certain way, it becomes a 6.

The O represents a hole, which is supposed to represent our heads because they think our heads are empty and won’t realize this.

The V is one line short of a triangle.

I represents the greed of our people. “I, I, I, me, me, me.”

D is an open happy face if positioned correctly. However, rotate it upside down horizontally and it’s a D: face, which means anguish and fear, which they’re trying to put onto us.

19 has a 6 in it, if you turn the 9 upside down. But look at the number 19 upside down and it says “6L.” The L stands for laughing out loud, which is what they’re doing when they see you fools believing the virus is actually real.
