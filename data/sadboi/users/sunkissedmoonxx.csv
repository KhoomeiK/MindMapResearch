CoronavirusUS,fqfzl4v,t3_gijn6u,1589334863.0,"I used to work at a plasma center before this pandemic. Once I got very sick with the flu but had no sick days to use and I was already on an attendance warning. Despite this, my job had absolutely zero qualms with me working while being sick. With the nature of my job, I would just use a simple mask from a hospital in an effort not to spread my sickness. Working through the illness extended the illness itself by weeks, and after the first initial week I was approached by a member of senior management and was told that since I was scaring the guests that were coming through to donate I could no longer wear the mask. Back then I was dumb and naive enough to actually believe him. People really don't care about their well being, it 'looks' ugly."

CPTSD,feg09zy,t3_eoxj3n,1579071481.0,"OH MY GOD.
I used to be so diligent about my journals. I had a collection growing up, and used every single one of them front to back. Then my mom decided to take a peak at one my journals. You can guess the overall result was not well. I hate that I don't write like I used to, but I can't and probably will never shake the feeling that whatever I pour onto the page won't make it back to SOMEONE because they decided to be nosy and peak at my entries to 'figure' me out.

People suck."

They do it to make themselves feel like a 'hero' for a short while, imo. Im SO sorry it didn't work out for you though :( Still to this day, my family and I will have screaming fights over dishes because I am SO sick of them bossing me around STILL. Even my younger siblings! So entitled!"
narcissisticparents,feerz7j,t1_feeqexh,1579039944.0,"Fucking seriously. The only reason why the chores started being spread out to my younger siblings was after my physically+ abusive stepfather came into the picture and after several years put his foot down and made my mom dole out the chores in a MUCH more even fashion. But no one seems to see the problem in that my obviously very abusive stepfather had to step up to correct my 'perfect' mom. God only knows how long I would have been the family slave if it wasn't for that.

Edit:

Who am I lying to? Once the family slave, it's hard to get away from that label."
