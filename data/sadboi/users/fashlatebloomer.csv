AskRedditAfterDark,fqp4kf5,t3_gk59np,1589534789.0,"I definitely think reddit can be a step to Onlyfans. I have started posting some nsfw pics because my bf and I get super hot and turned on by doing the photo shoots and then reading all the comments and messages. I don’t get tons of karma. Sometimes hardly any, sometimes maybe a hundred? I have like 250 followers. 

Guys on here request more all the time. It usually ends with a “no thanks, I have a boyfriend”, but a surprising amount offer to make it a business arrangement at that point... or just offer $3 per minute sexting right off the bat. I’m tempted to try it. It’s something that turns me on, and my bf not only doesn’t mind, he thinks it’s sexy as fuck. I am considering an Onlyfans because so far, guys offer money and want to talk on kik, but I have no idea how else to collect $ without using a pay app that could delete my account for doing it."

My bf and I trained at a local BJJ studio while we were there, and made some friends who were willing to talk about Moroccan politics. The bottom line is that the people of Morocco are the customers of the king, more than simply subjects. He owns many, MANY businesses, including Marjane, the only big supermarket/Walmart type chain in the country. He also has monopoly stakes in the fields of telecommunications, banking, and mining. 

Bottom line, Morocco is only a partially free society, and it’s hard to know how locals really feel when talking to outsiders."

BPD,foex52j,t3_g70ov2,1587717892.0,"I combatted this by getting familiar with the 9 diagnostic criteria and working really hard to self-validate. When someone gaslights me, asking if I’m having an episode or whatever, I analyze the situation out loud. “Well, I am having an emotional reaction to (whatever thing triggered your emotions). I am not displaying self harm, explosive anger or dissociation. Most people who were treated this way would feel (hurt, sad, stressed, disrespected, etc.). So no, I don’t think it’s an episode, this is a natural reaction to (whatever just happened). 


If I can’t analyze it like this... sometimes it IS an episode. And then I go to emotional regulation techniques- self-soothe, distract, etc."
BPDsupport,fo366el,t1_fo2s5qi,1587481282.0,"So, I was in an intensive DBT program, so everything was actually pretty scripted/clinical. The first thing that they target are life threatening behaviors, suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Mine were always more episodic than long term and would be dealt with with phone coaching of specific DBT skills. Then they tackle treatment interfering behaviors, which for me was very high cannabis dependence. I was an all day, everyday dabber. 

My therapist and I went over Pros/Cons of sobriety vs. drug use a lot. It’s a bit more detailed in DBT than just a quick list, but it helped put things in perspective of what “my life worth living” looked like... and it didn’t include the intense brain fog and lost energy and potential of being such a heavy stoner. My therapist really pushed me to make a commitment to be sober for a length of time, that I chose. I initially just committed to the year I was in treatment. Once I really accepted that I WANTED to be sober, I practiced a lot of different skills to help me achieve it. I went to my psychiatrist to help me get some short term sleep and anxiety medicine to help with my withdrawal symptoms. Several emotional regulation skills are just the routines I mentioned above- a regular sleep schedule, consistent exercise and a manageable healthy eating routine. They all really helped me maintain the stability I needed to resist urges with other skills like distraction, self-soothe and opposite action. My therapist coached me in setting boundaries (by role-playing) with my friends that would help me stay sober. I DEARMAN’d several friends, letting them know I needed their support in this, or I needed to take time away from them. She validated me by letting me know that it’s ok to prioritize my own goals for a healthy life over the desires of my friends to get high and watch the same tv shows over and over. 


Leaving my last partner was very difficult. We were together 8 years. He isn’t a bad person, but he is a very bad match for someone with my intense emotional needs. He paid for my treatment, for which I’m grateful, but would not attend family sessions recommended by my therapist and questioned why being validating was important (he is hyper logical and more concerned about being “right”). We got into a bad codependent dynamic where he was more of a caregiver to me than a partner and became overly controlling and critical of everything I did, even as I was improving with therapy. He had total control financially and I struggled because he told me I wouldn’t be able to make it without him and I believed it. Then, right at the end of my treatment, my therapist got a new job that she couldn’t pass up. It was like lightning struck, I realized I needed to use the last bit of my time with her to leave. I needed her help one more time. She helped me role play the ways that I would approach several hard conversations- me breaking up with him, and me asking my mom to help me leave were the big ones. She validated my feelings, encouraged me to open up to others that validated me as well. I ended up being able to pack up my stuff and leave semi-amicably. I was broke and scared, but I did it. 

I met my current boyfriend pretty much right away... did long distance for 3 months and then I moved in with him. Definitely caused some raised eyebrows. My BPD is no longer in control of my life, but I still have a strong need for attachment and we got serious really quickly. I’m happy with him, and more importantly, I’ve learned to accept and love myself because I’m in control of my emotions. 

Reasons I think this relationship is so much healthier and happier: I’m really careful to keep up my skills, continue seeing a therapist (although not a DBT specialist anymore), and practice good routines and boundaries. I don’t just imitate his interests or agree with all his thoughts so he likes me more, I am myself and having that separateness is sometimes scary for me, but it means that when we are intimate, we can really connect, if that makes sense. You can’t connect with someone if you’re trying to “be one” with them all the time. 

That was kind of a brain dump. Feel free to ask me more questions or DM me!"
BPDsupport,fo2cehj,t3_g5a36m,1587457090.0,"It is totally understandable that you feel hurt and used over this, and I want you to know that your feelings over how you were treated are valid. It hurts a lot when someone you trust betrays you and when those types of relationships fall apart, it’s normal to be sad, hurt and angry.

However, asking reddit users to text this woman is not a healthy, and is only going to reinforce her negative opinion of you. Putting her phone number on reddit and asking other users to hound her for money is, in fact, a toxic thing to do. And probably against brigading rules on Reddit and can get your account banned.

If you are hard up for money and medical bills are a problem, I highly recommend you go back to Arkansas and get treatment there. Arkansas has expanded Medicaid through Obama care and Texas hasn’t. Any hospitalizations, therapy and meds are likely to cost you $0 out if pocket if you qualify for Medicaid in Arkansas."
BPDsupport,fnwwui7,t1_fnwt693,1587327015.0,"Honestly, it was life changing. I did a full course in a year that included a group session and individual session each week and 24/7 phone coaching. I went from having 8/9 BPD symptoms to 4/9, so no longer qualifying as BPD in the DSM. I ended up leaving a toxic relationship that was super invalidating and keeping me in a really dark/suicidal place. I developed healthy routines that keep my emotions stable. I didn’t realize how closely my physical state impacted my emotional state. I was able to achieve and maintain sobriety for the first time in my adult life. My therapist taught me how to figure out who I really am, instead of me just copying the interests of my friends. 

It was hard work, and it’s still a challenge. My emotions haven’t become less intense... I’ve just learned healthier coping mechanisms to replace my toxic ones. At first, you learn like a class, just reviewing them in a book. But, if you practice them daily, eventually they become ingrained."

I would say to try and engage him in healthy ways when you can, and continually talk up the benefits of therapy so when his insurance kicks in he actually goes. The stronger the delusions, the more likely someone is to not actually make it to their first appointment because he thinks he’s fine. And he needs a psychiatrist and psychologist that specializes in delusional disorders, not just a general family therapist. Maybe you can help do some of that research for him. Good luck."
BPDsupport,fnokhma,t3_g2tkox,1587127565.0,"I’m not really sure what kind of support you are looking for. This is a BPD support page. There is a lot of stigma attached to having BPD, especially on certain subreddits. Your ex has BPD, but the problem that you seem to want support about is that you feel guilty for behaving abusively towards your ex. This is the advice that I have to give to YOU. 

It is completely natural that you would have feelings of guilt about the times that you have lost control and acted out in anger. It is a good thing that you feel these feelings of shame and guilt, because those feelings can guide you to not repeat your mistakes. It sounds like your marriage was unhealthy for both of you, and spiraled out of control. I understand that your aggressive behavior probably doesn’t align with how you view yourself. This is probably true for your ex and her cheating behavior as well. It is important for your own recovery and future growth that you take responsibility for your own actions, just as I’m sure you want your ex to take responsibility for hers. 

I want to congratulate you on your sobriety! That’s a fantastic thing for you and your kids. Have you considered adding therapy? I usually recommend DBT, since that is the gold standard treatment for BPD. Cognitive Behavioral therapy might be a better fit for you. If you’re worried about therapy impacting your status in the military, you can download an app called Woebot. It is a chat bot that teaches CBT skills. 

To get support regarding the details of your divorce, maybe go to r/divorce. 
 

Good luck, be well."
BPDsupport,fnod051,t3_g2vk1t,1587120931.0,"I don’t know much about DID, but this is the advice I’d give for BPD alone. 

The big question for me is whether your loved one is in treatment or open to treatment. BPD is a personality disorder that is indicated by having at least 5/9 symptoms listed in the DSM. With treatment, you absolutely CAN reduce your symptoms to have less than 5, meaning you no longer qualify. The work is difficult, dialectical behavioral therapy is what I did and I still have to practice every day, but it’s 100% worth it. 

I wouldn’t leave a partner just for having a mental health diagnosis. However, if they aren’t interested in going through treatment, that is usually a recipe for codependency and compassion fatigue."
BPDmemes,fn7bb79,t3_fzx8xb,1586716951.0,Intense outbursts of anger is only one criteria of nine. You only need 5/9 to be diagnosed. It’s almost as if.... we’re actually individuals and not just a stereotype?! /s

BPDsupport,fn2ij4c,t3_fy5poo,1586590275.0,"It’s hard, but probably healthier for you to block him. Skills that help me do that when I need to are: 

opposite action- when you have an urge to unblock or call, do the exact opposite. Turn off your phone, distract with something hands on that activates your senses. 

Pros/cons- list out the probable pros of keeping him in your life and the probable cons. Then, do it the other way. List out the probable pros of moving on from him and the probable cons. Doing it both ways can make things more clear."
BPDsupport,fn2i5rt,t3_fyydi0,1586589879.0,"I did. In my case I had spent years in treatment for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I was incredibly treatment resistant to meds, talk therapy, even TMS. The next step was going to be electroshock. So I did some digging. I matched 8 of the 9 DSM criteria. My current therapist wasn’t comfortable diagnosing me as she wasn’t familiar with BPD patients, so sent me to a specialist who confirmed the first session and referred me to DBT treatment. I would hesitate to encourage people to self-diagnose, only because without seeing a specialist, you can’t really know for sure."
BPDsupport,fn2ho80,t3_fypiu7,1586589376.0,"BPD is a really hard thing to experience, both from the diagnosed’s point of view and their loved ones. It’s hard to advise exact coping skills without more information. I understand that sex is an issue for you, but sex isn’t probably the issue FOR HER. Her lack of sex drive is probably directly related to her current mental health. Is your partner in treatment? What are the communication issues? What are the “questionable” things? 

BPD can look different for different people, because you only need to have 5 out of 9 key symptoms. One of the nine key symptoms is fear of abandonment- this can lead to clingy behavior, or to pushing people away before they “leave us”. Or even swinging between both! Speaking of swinging between both, “splitting” is another name for another one of the nine symptoms- unstable relationships caused by extreme shifts in idealizing and devaluing others. Meaning one minute someone is perfect and amazing and the next they are horrible and the worst. 

This pandemic is really hard (even without BPD) because it forces some kind of distance between you and almost everyone in your life (triggering fears of abandonment). The exception being people you live with. This is hard for ANY relationship, it’s totally natural and to be expected... but if a person is prone to “splitting” the constant forced togetherness is probably going to trigger some devaluation. Not because they are bad people, but because people with BPD tend to feel their feelings super intensely, so an already intense situation (being socially isolated due to a global crisis with a newer partner, living together less than 6 months and naturally getting on each other’s nerves) can become a huge deal. 

If your gf is in treatment, I would recommend her checking in with her psych to see if she needs to get meds adjusted, her therapist to discuss what skills might help her to regulate her emotions during this time. Something that you could do to help her would be to support her in getting into a healthy daily routine. A big chunk of emotional regulation skills in DBT is just taking care of your body. Getting enough sleep, eating well, exercise, avoiding drugs. 

Let me know if you have other questions. Good luck!"

1. I didn’t like how the long on/off switch part felt when I tried wearing it in public. It was a bit awkward. Even though I understand it needs to be there for removal, I wish it were shorter. 

2. As stated above, i also found it better for getting me revved up/edging, but it rarely made me cum. When it did, I was usually using the long part to make it go in and out of my pussy, so not really using it as intended... when the long part gets wet it’s slippery! 

3. The app definitely works from anywhere, but sometimes it would close unexpectedly which would sometimes kill the mood at JUST the wrong time. This only happened twice over 3 months, but it sucked both times."

I would tell the director or whoever is in charge that your interactions with therapist is “treatment interfering”. That’s a key DBT phrase. Say that you need to use skills- radical acceptance to accept that your therapist is NOT your friend and opposite action to not engage with him... not because he’s a bad person, but because the closeness you feel to him is actively stopping you from recovering. Ask for a new lead therapist and for some coaching to reduce your feelings of distress over this."

BPDsupport,fg4ecqx,t3_ewdfth,1580501896.0,"I don’t know if your FP is the worst... that’s pretty black and white, but it certainly sounds like your FP is exacerbating your BPD. This toxic cycle creates a larger fear of abandonment and probably encourages more idolizing/devaluing emotions towards him and is clearly an unstable relationship in your life. The whole situation is probably super invalidating, which is problematic, because an invalidating environment can drive those with BPD into further distressed states, potentially leading to self-harm or suicidal ideation. 

I really recommend DBT if you can get it. The skills will help you strengthen your inner sense of self and confidence in your ability to manage your emotions tied to him and in general. 

You can care deeply for this man and still need to distance yourself for your own inner peace. Both are true and valid. 

Good luck. 

Xoxo"
BPDsupport,fg4df24,t3_ewiap5,1580501396.0,"Are you in DBT? They would probably suggest a lot of Opposite Action and Radical Acceptance. 

Opposite Action is when you have a destructive emotion come up, you figure out what that emotion is urging you to do, and then do the opposite thing. It’s basically rewiring your brain to not give into the emotional impulses. Examples of opposite action in your case might include deleting his contact info so you can’t reach out to him, setting yourself up at work so you can’t make eye contact, spending time with people other than him when you miss him. 

Radical Acceptance basically means that when we no longer have any other active choices to reduce our suffering, we need to accept the reality before us. It sounds like you are out of options to engage in a healthy relationship with this man. Accepting reality means accepting that the beginning part of your relationship that you are mourning is gone and is not coming back. Once you radically accept this, your suffering will lessen. 

Other skills that will help short term when your feeling really rough: 

 self-soothing, which uses your 5 senses to relax you. Example: sight- look at art you enjoy in happy colors or count tiles, sound- listen to your favorite podcast or playlist, smell- brew some (decaf) coffee or tea, touch- change the sheets on your bed, taste- slowly savor some comfort food you really enjoy. 

Distraction: this is only works if you engage in it until you are calm, and then use other skills like opposite action or radical acceptance. Basically you do activities you enjoy that reduce the distressing emotions. NO sad or romantic movies! Do things that don’t remind you of your guy. 

Hope this helps.

I saw my therapist this afternoon. After I got home, SO called and wanted to know what the therapist and I talked about. I didn’t want to tell him, but he asked a few times and I told him. 

It became increasingly clear to me that I am certain that I want to move back to my hometown. I want to accept a much better job that I’ve been offered and earn my own money, pay my own bills and not have a partner who monitors my spending. I want to spend a year at least, single and living with my recently divorced sibling, having adventures. I want to see friends at social gatherings regularly. 

I want these things for myself, because these things are more authentic to my “life worth living” than the life I’ve been living with my SO. 

I also want for my partner a life where he can trust his partner will be good in a crises. Where he can express his true feelings and vulnerability without worrying about the backlash of my feelings. I want him to be able to trust his partner not to have emotional dysregulation, impulsivity and black and white thinking. 

He is a good man, and I still think that this relationship has run its course. I will be moving back to hometown."

relationships,ezr3m4z,t1_ezqezq4,1568068035.0,"Honestly, no. If I move to my hometown, I’m going to explore dating with vigor. That alone makes me think that I’m more ready than I thought to move on."
relationships,ezr3e5b,t1_ezqosgl,1568067909.0,It’s like you’re speaking directly into my heart right now. I have felt these things deep down for awhile. Then I’d feel ashamed and guilty for having those thoughts. Thank you for validating that it’s not how a healthy relationship should work.
relationships,ezr2w7w,t1_ezqpg4h,1568067633.0,">	You don't have to stay just because he isn't the worst abuser in the world. You can leave if you are unhappy and he is the cause of that unhappiness.

Wow. For so long I didn’t believe that I did deserve happiness. I felt obligated to never push for what I wanted in this relationship because he was willing to take me “damaged”. This helped a lot. Thank you."
relationships,ezr2oaj,t1_ezqr09w,1568067513.0,I do have “my life worth living” written down. And it doesn’t match with the relationship that I’m in. Thank you.
relationships,ezr2iia,t1_ezqrizl,1568067428.0,"Wow, thank you so much. You know what? I’m proud of me too. I’m finally standing on my own two feet, and it feels really good."
relationships,ezr2dp2,t1_ezqv59z,1568067363.0,It helps me so much to hear that it’s ok for a relationship to run its course. Thank you.
relationships,ezr25te,t1_ezqx2a1,1568067254.0,"Thanks for your input. I think you’re right- I needed the right treatment the whole time. Once I got it, I realized that my “life worth living” doesn’t match with his."
relationships,ezqiirw,t1_ezqd97m,1568059709.0,"You nailed me. I am diagnosed with BPD. It’s why I’m so uncertain. Do I really want to leave or am I being symptomatic? My emotions have been very regulated, but I could see me wanting to leave as part of the fear of abandonment. He broke up with me already, and I’m pushing him away before he can do it again. 

The collecting of evidence is a good way to look at it. I think I do owe him some time to collect new evidence, and me some time to collect evidence on him. 

I also am ashamed of the flirting. Thanks for your advice."
relationships,ezpxuwi,t1_ezox79z,1568051017.0,"Thanks for this. My gut is saying “go”. I have a lot of reasons to stay and try to work on things, but that’s where my gut is at."
relationships,ezpxorv,t1_ezpw82x,1568050912.0,"Right?! Not that it should matter, but I’m objectively good looking, so it’s super frustrating to see interest from other guys and none from my partner."
relationships,ezpxkm0,t1_ezpw7zm,1568050839.0,This comment really spoke to my instincts. Thank you for your insight.
relationships,ezpvty7,t1_ezpv1j5,1568049729.0,">	No dude. Fuck you and your blowjobs. Now you get to pay $25 a pop in the alley, enjoy.

LOL!! This cracked me up, because that’s exactly what my anger is telling me right now."
relationships,ezptrt9,t1_ezpmyoa,1568048355.0,"I appreciate your take on this. 

>	As long as you're not miserable, suicidal, being abused, being abusive, I'd give it some more time.

This isn’t happening, except me being slightly miserable with the uncertainty."
relationships,ezpt2z0,t1_ezp8hla,1568047896.0,Thanks. Guilt is definitely a factor here. I need to separate the guilt from the issue.
relationships,ezpsz8z,t1_ezp3rsr,1568047826.0,">	An ended relationship is not a failure. 

Thanks for that. It really resonates with me. 

Your interpretation of his behavior is really helpful as well. Thank you."
