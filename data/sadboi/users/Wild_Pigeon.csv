Tried shrooms, LSD, DMT, LSD analogues... Tried microdosing them, tried heroic doses, tried meditating on them if I could.. No substantial changes.

 Sure I was tripping balls and had epiphanies of various sorts, but none lasted after the trip like I've heard from other people's experiences. 

Infact, now I'm depressed more than I have ever been. Guess some people's brains just don't benefit from psychedelics ( hey at least I didn't become psychotic... Or did I? )"

It helped with a certain outlook I had on life before, when I thought I was the smartest person ever and everybody else was wrong. Psychedelics taught me I know jack shit and that we're part of something greater than us, something uncomprehensible, which made me humble and more emphatetic over time.

getting_over_it,ex1kmn5,t3_cr1xoc,1565948321.0,"Grief is normal in this situation, you should feel sad, don't try to hide your emotions.

My advice is, find friends. Or a therapist. Anyone to talk to. We are social animals first and foremost, if we ignore that aspect of our being our emotional pains will be far greater than they should be. Hey, maybe even get to know your rommate better, who knows, maybe he's a compassionate and a good listener.

Also, I know this feeling very well, that you won't be able to find someone as good as her. This may be too much for you right now, but I just wanna say that this feeling will go away. Our brains trick us with these emotional bonds and make us think that we just lost our only chance at love. It's a primitive instinct fueled by fear that paints a false picture of the situation. In reality, you will most likely find someone even better for you in the future. 

You are young and as you get older your preferences will change. So, for now, be sad, grief. But remember that this isn't permanent. You will come out of this stronger and wiser."
