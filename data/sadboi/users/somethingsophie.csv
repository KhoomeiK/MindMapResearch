You're already doing great by seeing your psychiatrist and therapists. I encourage you to take notes on your feelings so that you can provide accurate accounts to your doctors. Articulate your needs and your expectations. Given what you've listed, you may not be in the most stable of states. 

Have open and honest conversations with your partner about controlling hypersexuality. It may be unpleasant and uncomfortable, but saying ""Honey, I love you, but I'm experiencing a bout of hypersexuality where I want to screw everything in sight. I am hoping we can work together to discuss exit strategies for me. I do not want to ever become unfaithful, and I am asking for your support in this difficult time.""

(lmfao nasty shit isn't it) Because of this, my psychiatrist said I should never had addie as I will go manic. 

These days, my attention deficit is still pretty bad. I make the joke that I ""can't read"" because I actually cannot focus enough on the words to get through a sentence. It's gotten a lot better with the calming of the bipolar symptoms, but it's still not great. I do supplement by stimming and trying to find different methods that work for me. Since you mentioned school, something that combated my complete inability to focus on reading was audiobook recordings of textbook. That way, I could physically do other stuff.

You're right don't move through the world like everybody else, but everybody else receives our actions as if they do.

Now for the ugly part, if you were to take it to court, there may be a plea of innocence by insanity. However, it is crucial to note that not all things that happen in court are necessarily morally right. I hate it. I hate it so bad. Additionally, A plea is just a plea. It is not a ruling. 

Following this, as a person with the condition that experiences hypersexuality, rape has never and will **NEVER** be on the table. Our condition is not an excuse. We have a condition, but we move through the world just like everybody else. Our actions effect other people regardless of where it comes from (illness or not).

That aside, my ex that I raised my dog with (def not a hypoallergenic dog) was slightly allergic to him.
