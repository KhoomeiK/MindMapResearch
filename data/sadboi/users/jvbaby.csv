I've tried to talk to my parents about this but they are stubborn about not changing it. The drug's website offers $15 copay coupons but upon going to CVS again today to try and get it, they said it is not valid with my insurance. Almost every medication I've been on in the last five years has been over $85 a month or my insurance didn't cover it and it's difficult. I know it's easy to judge on the internet when it's not your life but trust me, I want to be on those meds more than you know. I am a very responsible hard-working person and it is devastating for me to not have access to my medication because of an insurance company that's supposed to help me afford it."

This song is about battling negativity, whether it's from our environment, each other, or even ourselves. The artist captures the listener by sharing their own struggles but motivates herself and them to keep going, despite the bad thoughts. ""Negativity is growing but focus, don't let it spread."" The engineer and producer has worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers & Foo Fighters so the production is spectacular. Jos Vincent even played the trumpet on the track's outro!

How do we feel about people of one color using emojis of a different color?

I think the best thing for you to do is start correcting your thoughts to ""I'm a survivor"" instead of ""I'm a victim."" Being aware of how I view myself was crucial in turning my life around. I recommend you listening to this song ""Crane Your Neck"" by Lady Lamb just laying down or driving- just really focus on it. It goes through all of my emotions and makes me feel in control again."
