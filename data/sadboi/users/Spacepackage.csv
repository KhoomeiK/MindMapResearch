PMDD,fmnjiqv,t3_fw9aoz,1586227514.0,"I believe you are spot on with the progesterone. I flare up in psoriasis land around this time and it seems to be in line with excess allopregnenalone (ALLO). 

I found this suggesting something that may be [helpful](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/autoimmune-progesterone-dermatitis/). It is about autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. Maybe my “cyclical psoriasis” is this. Ive noticed cutting down on red meat (organic vegan majority of the time preferably), making sure I’m keeping up on my b-12 spray, magnesium, b-vits, zinc, 60mg cbd/day, acupressure mat 1hr/day has helped immensely. Also removing corn and most grains. Keeping up on lots of healthy oils like coconut unrefined and extra Virgin olive oil (EVOO). 

In nutrition this is looked at as keeping blood pH in basic as opposed to acidic status. Acidic foods disrupt hormone balance, red meat and processed have an acidic pH. Veggies and healthy oils have neutral or basic and good fatty acids. In eastern medicine this is yin and yang concept. Yin being a “cool” food or basic pH and yang being a “hot” food or acid pH. 

In any case processed foods tend to jack up progesterone while healthy stuff helps our systems. 

Other things I’ve found help are good hydration and lower sugar intake (again back to hormone regulation), more “me” time if possible, really trying to stop and catch myself because I get a tad hulkish beef babe around this time. So I require many a time out. Gentle words of niceness. 

I know some of us here struggle with the self love. We gotta do it for ourselves so we feel better about letting others in. It helps during the times you all know I’m referring to.

PMDD,fikd1uj,t1_fik6v2s,1582478022.0,"Thank you so much for posting this. I start feeling a little distraught when I’m reading peoples posts on removing major organs. 

I have been following a vegan diet just since the new year and have noticed night and day differences as well. My hell week was ok, a little fuzzy. My actual menstrual cycle was insanely emotional, whereas before I usually experienced the orgasmic relief of starting my period. You’ll see an earlier post where I refer to it as “ketchup bottling” on my heating pad. I didn’t have that this time, I had a more “normal” overly emotional estrogen fueled meltdown. Which to me is a great sign because that looks like a backward grade down from PMDD heights. Most people are recommending keeping track of three cycles in a row, so I am doing that and taking tight notes. 

I have also been recommended the Shakti Mat - it is an acupressure type yoga mat that another user on here claims in addition to her healthy diet was the “key” for her. It’s $60 US and I want one now. 

Again thank you for your post. I think you are on the right track with this healing. I have tried CBD and CBG but I think the CBG I’ve had is 1-2%. Which is good but I would like to try the 10%+ you mentioned. 

I cut out alcohol for eight months, I’m pushing for all organic because of the glyphosate and numerous other issues with the pesticide and GMO industry. I have added supplements zinc, magnesium, b-vitamins, b-12 spray, calcium. The zinc I don’t need every day, but the b-12 spray and b-vits I’m not sure how to go without anymore. 

I have noticed severe emotional disturbances the higher my input of pesticides gets. Last month I inadvertently ran an experiment where I was eating pesticides with every meal. I believe it contributed to the estrogen spike during menstrual because of the endocrine disrupters and estrogen mimicking. I have atopic dermatitis on my scalp, which is exacerbated by ALLO in the bloodstream, sugar, processed foods, spicy foods, stress, sweat, and alcohol. Once my scalp starts going I know something is happening with my hormones. It’s a pretty immediate red flag to something I’m eating or doing or something that my body is doing. The whole thing is one big distracting trip. 

Anyway, thank you for sharing a noninvasive success story. I do believe it is the best most correct way to do this thing. ❤️🔥"

I’m glad you’ve found this place. I’m not glad you have PMDD but this sub has turned me around so much. I was completely blind in the dark in my understanding and healing, comparatively. There’s something about the familial bonding here that makes it all okay because everyone seems to get it. Idk how many PMDDers you’ve met irl but it’s far and few because they’ve either been diagnosed with something else more popular or are more on the normal end. Primarily because it’s so much more dynamic than “super bad PMS” and we know that now as science continues to spew info. It’s here that I’ve found many links relating to diet that I’ve been able to implement and have seen noticeable changes. 

I laughed when I thought about how long this place has been here and I just was doing my terminally alone thing month after month year after year... it’s a lot to think about considering the Internet is so fresh for us to be able to come together it makes me sad to think how many thousands, if not millions of women have gone through this misdiagnosis and isolation.

PMDD,ffgjkey,t1_ffg4hwx,1579907710.0,"You are very welcome!! Please message me if you find anything of interest or if you simply want to have a conversation about any of this stuff. I thoroughly enjoy researching nutrition and the body so this is great. 

I’m glad this conversation came up when it did, as timing is everything with PMDD. It is day 17 for me so this is about my peak in brain clarity and being able to write at all haha. That’s what’s going to be interesting as I do this diet because I’m trying to journal in order to monitor my food intake and reactions to supplements. Journaling or writing anything down for that matter becomes increasingly difficult the more entrenched into Hell week I get as I’m sure many of you may relate. My presence in this sub will be indicative of my success haha. 

That L-Theanine seems to be of particular interest too because it mimics GABA behavior and for that is known as an adaptogen. It increases dopamine and serotonin as well. All great for many processes including knocking out the anxiety. The amino acid was studied in Japan during 1949 which is why green tea comes up as a common known source. It is also found in black tea and some mushrooms. This is also thought to be the culprit for the “umami” taste so hungrily sought after in cuisine.

Edit: Omg! Thank you so much for the Gold!!! That is incredibly sweet of you and now I’m weeping 😂💕😭💜 thank you kind fellow PMDD friend!! Let’s hack away at this together!!"

Oh another thing we should take note of is water sourcing and consumption: Please understand RO Reverse Osmosis water is the most recommended at this time as the main water supply is contaminated [and fluoride is a thing.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-016-0563-5) Foods and supplements to combat fluoride build-up we all have from a lifetime of consumption through canned foods, toothpaste, and tap water include: calcium carbonate, magnesium, vitamin c, selenium, iodine, cilantro, and chlorella. Please research this matter further as it affects us all. 

Switching to glass over plastic is helpful too as we know plastic is ""bad"" but more specifically in the form of [endocrine disruptors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor) You will see that this becomes more than the ""right diet plan"" because as our way in to PMDD is very complicated, is apart of why we are so frustrated and confused on the journey out. We can do this. We need to read a lot and commit to the discipline in eating what we are supposed to eat so our bodies can do what they are so desperately lovingly trying to do. I know I don't have all of the answers right now but it is getting better."
PMDD,ffg40wz,t1_ffa7mep,1579897984.0,"I agree this is interesting and takes up most of my time now. I don't know specifically of PMDD literature that has a diet plan. It may be out there or soon to come. Part of the difficulty may be that there is not going to be a one size fits all on this because as nutrition expands, it is becoming increasingly certain that each person has an ideal biochemical homeostasis where a cell is at it's optimized function. This is for all people, not just people suffering with imbalances but this is commonly where they are recognized or exacerbated by natural life events or trauma.

It is important to recognize that in deciding what I'm doing for diet to address PMDD, I'm taking into account our physiology, the contaminants in the food supply, controversial topics, and any or all updates on discoveries in the nutritional world. So that's where my reading recommendations come from. They helped me understand more of what's going on and allowed me to learn more about how that's affecting my body. I become more motivated when I can understand the ""why"" and ""how"".

Basically it is important to understand that at a minimum, GMOs cause disruption to our vital systems.

[No Pain No Grain by Dr. Peter Osborne](https://drpeterosborne.com/no-grain-no-pain-book/) is by far one of the most helpful books in understanding the effects of grain on the body. The intent of the book is to educate as well as guide through a 30-day grain free diet plan. It includes **recipes and food lists** which may be helpful for many. It does allow meat in this diet. I started a vegan journey at the New Year so I'm doing a variation.

[The Game Changers Documentary](https://gamechangersmovie.com/) blew my world out of the water on the meat vs vegan issue. There are too many reasons to ignore. The reality is many of our physical ailments would diminish, recur less often, we could heal faster. Our bodies work better on plants simply put. I highly recommend that one it is 90 minutes of your time, I saw it on Netflix. I feel insanely better already after 3 weeks of making these changes.

Colin Campbell](https://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1941631568/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0/147-7145786-6642209?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1941631568&pd_rd_r=a5330e11-3500-4ba2-b4d3-7daabad90667&pd_rd_w=YON2c&pd_rd_wg=Nd0br&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=E9600VPDVM90TX25X98D&psc=1&refRID=E9600VPDVM90TX25X98D) is a fascinating book expanding on the most comprehensive study done to identify foods that promote longevity and those that contribute to the cause of illness. It strongly supports a plant-based diet.

Based on the readings above, the article by Dr. Raffi, slight personal obsession through the magical mystery of ADHD and PMDD, this is what I am going off of to achieve reduced symptoms of PMDD, plant-based, pesticide and GMO-free, to lessen the symptoms of trauma (basically lower cortisol and make that easier to manage), and to feel better all around.

**Supplements - I take these with food because if my food had enough nutrients in it I wouldn't need supplements**. It is important to focus on the least processed, most organic kinds\*\*:\*\* Zinc citrate because it helps ovaries to produce progesterone and estrogen (alleviating withdrawal symptoms), B-Vit complex, B-12 spray 500mcg per dose, calcium crushed from free range organic egg shells (because free otherwise calcium carbonate is good)

\*\*Magnesium has been fairly important for me in its calming effects 

Another post recently inspired me to research [Histamines and how they relate to PMDD](https://www.wholemamasclub.com/functional-medicine-approach-pmdd/). That was an ""aha"" moment for me as I've consumed [high histamine foods](https://www.histamineintolerance.org.uk/about/the-food-diary/the-food-list/) consistently throughout my life. Interestingly, this type of diet can contribute to the intense inflammation we feel in PMDD because it can cause a DAO Deficiency. Histamine intolerance symptoms can be caused by leaky gut, alcohol, DAO deficiency, food, allergies. The implications are enhanced or more commons in [MTHFR mutations](https://mthfrsupport.com.au/2016/09/histamine-and-gut-health-the-unlikely-connection-between-allergies-and-our-own-gut-microbes/) for those of you familiar. Gut health is increasingly becoming a for sure in the health of everyone including PMDD sufferers. This is going to be the pivotal factor in us healing. It is somewhere around 95% of serotonin is produced in the gut, and 5 percent from the brain. Our **food** is determining our health. It goes food-mental-physical. It is important to recognize all of these factors are connected. **It has become increasingly complicated to determine the right food list due to the state of the food supply.**

ALLO seems to be relevant, and tricky because it is newer in study and research. Recent Iraq/Afghan War veterans showing decreased ALLO showed increased chronic pain. [Biomarker Implications](https://watermark.silverchair.com/pme.12860.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAmgwggJkBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJVMIICUQIBADCCAkoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMcRVXDPbv9BY70tRIAgEQgIICGyMsON72_I1Rn988jwclO5YXh4Iokb-kNaBX8MHfRBD_3JFsP9ijpdyDAPRU1YR4BT_VFFwMeYDQjvjA1Pus1Z6SaAJniCRH5YgtczYUsttHE81aj0s74eDOMJiYIDwl7Aovp_AAl2diJE4RFWwqjQnHSAB0PVF2uXhUnz07e6WRD7pGlb1885cBEgyPED_S2CXnFfbBHdJrvGb9Sww1lIti6eSQ6YO-UX4l75pPiW0QQ9BEqVMjrGVZ9OolcTli7UK5FRCzYRucKEEfc-0spdSlmTQVQWbZJ9srbWh06pSfQ8LXDEIyeDnpocGKs82KOxqKEFxx5WUxORVnln5WSwhnRrZlK4h8uciX7r0vt1QthGMU3fDogYkrQnhzB5wTLE6p42-GGh5eJSmW5A-vRVbvyrjwSndTs66bxUKGO_ZlCNGHv1i3kgnKrCvw3bx2EL8L2HBuegvRx02Jj6cVFhMdfm5Gtv8ECkJImzY-fci1dkeY41T5MJQrril15jdHngeaYg9NuZ7BPKMjo_T24AsShux0_Nl6nUerUifmR-2ixUjGAIXY1Er-atYiGIatFOEridgcPT0QCItzMqws91t2yZdWhprvWD37Td8PdlwDmLM7-VajF1IgSdAvaWokIaOT1wbxsvwKuJzEX-uFDFtX1wC1umh0GvfxCC600hcsOr5xtduJWY2yfJORR9X3m60imYH4OS6-LkQw)

Interestingly enough, ALLO works with GABA and remember [What Is GABA?](https://www.healthline.com/health/gamma-aminobutyric-acid) GABA helps us to feel ok, which is important for those of us walking around with trauma. As my understanding of this is growing, trauma or PTSD seems to be nearly a requirement to enter this vast world of PMDD. My goal here is to increase GABA and decrease cortisol.

GABA Foods (that I'm doing): Apples, Broccoli, Beans, Carrots, Kale, Yams, Sweet Potatoes, Shiitake\* you'll notice mushrooms emerging as a health miracle for brain function this is big for us \*, Onions, I've read about Kava root being helpful as well have not yet experimented

Amygdala Foods and Supplements (that I'm doing): PUFAs Polyunsaturated Fats Coconut Oil, Nuts, Sunflower Seeds, Tryptophan Sources - Nuts, Niacin, B-Vitamins, GABA is important for calm amygdala - Flight or Fight

GABA conversion from precursor includes: Magnesium, B-Vits, B6

**B6 is a** [key vitamin cofactor for GABA synthesis.](https://www.integrativepsychiatry.net/natural_gaba.html)

Important to Note:

\*Caffeine decreases GABA\* however, L-Theanine has been found to be helpful and is found in Green Tea - I like to do Matcha as it has less caffeine than coffee but is concentrated in the amino acid.

PMDD,fffuqun,t1_ffbtj70,1579892226.0,"I read that too! That is addressed in The Etiology of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: 5 Interwoven Pieces article. In regard to Progresterone and ALLO, ""...rapid withdrawal from ovarian hormones may play a role in the etiology of PMDD. Much like alcohol or benzodiazepines, ALLO is a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors and has sedative, anesthetic, and anxiolytic properties. In times of acute stress, increased ALLO is known to provide relief. However, in women with PMDD, this typi­cal ALLO increase might not occur.

Patients with PMDD have been reported to have decreased levels of ALLO in the luteal phase.""

&#x200B;

This is an eye-opener for me because I've experienced both withdrawal from alcohol and benzodiazepines and can confirm in myself the similarities. I quit drinking July 2019 and this last luteal cycle I was struck during a blackout rage, ""I feel like I'm amidst an alcohol-induced fury, why am I storming around losing control over this \[not-to-scale situation\]?"" It was bizarre. That was the first week of January. I read this article leading me to research several topics and branched-off topics mentioned and studied therein on the 17th. It seems to have many keys, or hopeful pathways to correcting this complexly intertwined disorder because it appears to originate in trauma and lifestyle, being steered namely by diet, mental work, and activity level.  


For instance, what's the \*best\* way to minimize symptoms of withdrawal? For me, it was removing the substance altogether. That is awesome for alcohol and drugs, but that solution doesn't apply to progresterone-ALLO-GABA and estrogren-serotonin in the same way for me because those hormones provide emotion and fertility amongst a slew of additional human functions. So they stay in my system at a therapeutic level, avoiding the massive drops leading to the peaks and valleys so intensely experienced in PMDD. How is that level achieved? Ideally through diet, mindfulness training, and yoga (specifically yoga I say because in the GABA study cited in the article, ""27% saw an increase in GABA"" after one hour of yoga. The reason I think that is the best thing to do is because that's basically our own personalized version of a medication (like benzodiazepines or SSRI's) used while going through therapy (CBT is common for PMDD) and working through trauma.   


I am giving all of this a try and have been in a good position to do so as it is my day 17. A couple people in comments have asked about specific diet changes and readings for that. The nutrition conversation would be a great separate post as it in on-going and just such a hugely exciting topic for everyone especially us suffering with PMDD. Mostly because there's so much to it when you get down to what applies to this condition, and expanding from there to contaminated food supply, pesticides and hormonal impacts, GMOs and genetic impacts, histamines, and the list goes on. I'm listing some stuff that I'm applying to this cycle and the reasons why including types of food, targeted hormones, and hopeful outcomes and expectations."
PMDD,ffa62lc,t1_ff3apah,1579728594.0,"I agree with you in feeling vulnerable. It gets worse in public spaces with large crowds or more eyes on me. I thought it was a social anxiety tick for the longest time, but that’s simply a side effect to the underlying chronic inflammation causing what originally was likely a small injury from sports or overexertion. We can’t heal if we are constantly inflamed. That’s why injuries can be sustained for years into decades into lifetimes. 

I have cut out dairy and eggs. Eggs and dairy were difficult because I ran the keto throughout 2019. I was going through a dozen eggs every other day. The crazy thing about the keto is that it seems like it’s “about to work” as far as the promised clarity and energizer bunny like activity but it never hit that peak for me. There are many reasons (thick tar-like blood for one) that I started researching plant based. 

I love yogurt and have switched to plant based for that. There’s a brand called LAVA that does a probiotic one that I recommend. Coconut milk instead of cows milk is my favorite because it’s the (imho) best as it hits all markers between taste and health. Other options include pea protein isolate but that has been processed and manufactured, posing an allergy risk to the genome. 

One of my friends asked me, “so what are you going to eat? Vegetables and fruit?” To which I replied, “basically, along with some supplements, herbs, oils, teas...”, where she says, “so, a cancer diet.” I hadn’t thought of it that way as it seems a little unnerving and undesirable to say the least, but she meant it in a clarifying way that actually emphasized the weight in all of this. We are surrounded by processed this and made-up that, so to suggest going to ONLY fresh fruits and veggies along with proper fats like coconut or olive oil seems depriving, and hardly the healthiest or happiest option. But it is and we all know that deep down. It’s deciding to accept it and appreciate it and be ready to go on that embarking of a journey because that’s what it became for me, and is one of the best decisions I’ve made. 

What’s happening in our society is a ratio of eating and living mostly unhealthy with a few days or times focused of living healthy. This makes criticizing “health nuts” easy because they seem like they are asking for extreme changes and they are. But why they seem extreme is because of how far away we are as a whole into unhealthy land. Super important to remember when you’re feeling discouraged and overwhelmed by learning all of this and trying to make changes. It can become daunting and that’s when the defeatist feelings take over and the “maybe tomorrow” negotiations. Just realize it’s going to take time and it’s a continuing process the more science reveals to us. 

My inflammation is down significantly. I am able to adjust and crack C3-6 and those are the ones that get locked in by swelling. Literal years of those being stuck because I don’t do the chiro and that’s where my chronic stress stays. It’s hard to describe but basically I’m flopping around more kinda like Gumby as opposed to the tin man all stiff and rickety. I’ve noticed fluid retention is down to almost 0, I have an issue with migraines and those have lessened significantly. Lowering sugar helps me too, I’m sensitive to everything including the effects of sugar lol. 

Other changes I’ve made include b-vitamin complex, b-12 spray, magnesium, and most recently (2 days ago no noticeable effects) zinc.
I am also working on mental stuff through listening to meditation, doing some stretches / massages. 

The biggest takeaway from going vegan that I’ve noticed is my body’s behaviors in dealing with the food at hand exhausting itself with damage control on the now (eating meat), and being able to USE the food to HEAL (eating plants)."
PMDD,ff9zdzp,t3_esgmws,1579724758.0,"I want to point out that this is a piece to the very complex puzzle all of us are feeling so to say “the cause of all our issues” is simply too dismissive and plain incorrect. 

While the scientific discovery of this gene is crucial, another post here recently shared with us Dr. Edwin R. Raffi MD MPH’s findings. He has pieced together The Etiology of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: 5 Interwoven Pieces. 

1 of the 5 pieces includes Genetic Susceptibility, wherein the information in OP’s link is flourishing. I am working to find the diet, medicine interaction, trauma level, time of day, weather pattern theory, etc on how this mutation responds to environment and how it is impacting us suffering from PMDD. My current understanding is that much of the ESR1 gene in regard is speculative on heritable personality traits and cognitive arousal dysfunction. 

Reading through this Dr.’s findings has given me a new leg up this week. I highly recommend taking a look. He is really including the complexity and interwoven mechanisms involved here. I don’t know about you but this is part of why this is destroying me month after month, because it’s not just one thing. It’s not just changing one part of my diet, or taking a pill that addresses a set of symptoms, it is a lot more than that. I have the Etiology article linked [here](https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/etiology-premenstral-dysphoric-disorder/) , and I’ve also seen that looking at this has led me to researching GABA, allopregnanolone (ALLO), the amygdala and diet foods to support the production and function of these. 

The conversation is being steered toward a possible “withdrawal” symptom occurring when progesterone falls off the face of the cliff starting day 21. Progesterone to ALLO is important for the GABA receptor which in short helps us to feel ok. That is where the amygdala comes in, during luteal phase the cortisol levels rise, contributing to the flight or fight “losing it” feeling because without GABA and more cortisol, well we no longer feel ok. Like I said there is a lot to this and just wanted to add to the excitement because the genetic discoveries are so helpful as we do what feels like completely blindly find and fight our way through this. We can fix this."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ff6u8st,t3_erxjfv,1579634995.0,Haha! This is such an awesomely obvious thing that I’ve been doing and your description of it all is spot on. There are so many consistencies throughout my encounters with males since I hit puberty and it all has to do with the ultimate Requirement to control and steer and be at the finish line before it starts. That’s helpful to look at as I continue my tornado pathway through life doing things I don’t identify with in order to stay “safe”.
stopdrinking,ff2hp56,t1_feuym91,1579506602.0,That really is so interesting. It makes me look at the #BOSSLADY culture in a similar light. It feels paper thin in terms of authenticity and thorough satisfaction with day in and day out life in the facade. Behind the makeup and hair we see a lot of emotional disasters being medicated with this and that. It’s sad. It’s okay to talk to yourself about the fears. No need for us to run ourselves into the ground. Thanks for sharing the historical reference and added perspective.

PMDD,ff2h44h,t3_er0bpu,1579505880.0,"I’ve been seeing the conversation being steered toward diet primarily being plant-based to help reduce inflammation. I’ve suffered with joint and muscle pain for over a decade. My research / obsession to feel better lead me to trying many types of diets including name catchy ones like the recent keto to personalized ones and everything in between. 
I started a plant-based diet at the new year along with a focus on some other things like b vitamins, magnesium, and mental stuff like spending time with myself as much as I can to massage or relax and hydrate. I notice forcing myself to take it slow helps quite a bit. I’m the one who wants to move mountains when i should be resting, which makes the inflammation worse.
Some others things that are helping are reading about this condition more and the symptoms surrounding it. Mental work has been a newer primary focus to make sure I’m doing ok upstairs: writing thoughts and meals down and new research info (I forget evvvverything I read about the science technical stuff with PMDD hormone and emotional impact) that I find interesting. Mediation, focusing on good posture, the stuff I know I should do but “forget” or “don’t have time for”. Sometimes slowing down really is all I need to lessen my migraine from neck tension. My neck is one of my worst spots so I empathize, I want to rip it off sometimes and it’s just the most pestilent ache."
