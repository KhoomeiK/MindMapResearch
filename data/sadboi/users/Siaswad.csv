They were seated right next to me at True Food, about 10 minutes after I sat down. When I saw Kristina I thought, OMG is that Kristina? And then I Saw Rachel as well so it was confirmed. I don‚Äôt really know Whitney- she keeps a much lower profile, right?  She must have been the one who took the picture. 

At first I was just stunned and excited. It was my last night in LA and seeing a celebrity was on my secret bucket list that I did not reveal to my traveling companions. (It‚Äôs on everyone‚Äôs secret bucket list, right?)

My husband was trying to talk to me but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt relax until after I got a photo.  After a few minutes of me pretending to listen to whatever my husband was talking about I leaned over and touched Kristina on the arm and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not going to be able to concentrate until I say hello.  I‚Äôm a big fan, you are all even more beautiful in person.  Can I get a selfie?‚Äù They were gracious and Kristina asked me my name. Afterwards I tried very hard to give them their privacy and to NOT listen to what they were saying.  Lucky for them I have shit hearing.
 
They seemed like a regular trio of young women, they were poised and elegant. It didn‚Äôt sound like they were celebrating anything or revealing big secrets but as I said I was trying to give them their privacy. 

I‚Äôm so excited I got to see such beautiful women and they were gracious enough to receive me pleasantly. Such fun!"
