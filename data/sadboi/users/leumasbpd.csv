Borderline,fbccu7j,t3_eb1yrm,1576720980.0,"omg, its cool finding people like my. im a gay guy with bpd. im 21. i broke up one month ago, because situations like these and others (i often fought because of small reasons)

so, i want to say that i understan you and u are not alone. we arent crazy people, the question, in my opinion, is that we are always in the sentimental limit, and people dont comprise it. and, since we dont know how to controlate, quarrels, disagreements and conflicts are common

however, i think we are not condemned. since i started therapy i improved a lot, but the progress isnt linear...

sorry for the writing, im brazilian rs"
Borderline,fahrdk0,t3_e0bbtg,1576091885.0,"I had started schema therapy 2 months ago, when i was in relationship. Im a man with BPD and my relationship endured about 8 months. My partnet was also a man and he tried to support, but my first diagnosis was bipolar disorder and it wasnt sufficient to help me. 

Then, i improved a lot with mood stabilizers, but my relationship doesnt, and my humor changed just because it. So, in a new interview, i received bpd diagnosis.

After that, my psychologist started schema therapy and I improved like never before and im keeping this. However, my relationship was so outworn and we broke up a month ago because he started freaking out. Sometimes i feel guilt, but, on the other hand, he was so passive and omitted... i think we couldnt progress together and, in this moment, this is the better and the most rational decision"
