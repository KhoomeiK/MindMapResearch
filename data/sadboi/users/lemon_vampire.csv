This is 2.50 for a dozen eggs, which is nearly 1000 calories.  A 10 piece McNugget is twice the price and half the calories and significantly less protein.  And if that is still too expensive, these eggs could probably also be acquired for less if I negotiate a wholesale price.

And if you look at some of the poorest people on earth, you will notice they have something incredible in common, they all have livestock.  Chicken have an incredible ability to turn kitchen scraps into food.

I can guarantee if there are people who are poor but still can afford to go to the grocery store, have a car, have a tv, and have the internet, they can afford to buy local eggs from a neighbor, or even have their own chickens.

And don't you think it's a little worrying that you are taking on loans right out of school?  What if things don't go to plan?  What if your infrastructure fails you?  What if there is a massive poultry recall in grocery stores? 

I agree, industrial farming exists for a reason, but it's not a good reason.  There aren't enough farmers and people have fled to the cities, except for people like me, who have fled to the country, because cities are human CAFOs.  Farming changes, it always has.  It is different now than what it was 100 years ago, but what will it be 100 years down the line?  Will it be more well meaning farmers going into debt as their innovative minds and incredible work ethic is replaced by more chemicals and machines?  Or will it return to something more traditional, with some mechanical changes?  

We are using electric fencing to allow chickens access to specific pastures so they don't over or under work the land and can be moved to different paddocks for cleanliness and regenerative reasons.  Not to mention it keeps predators out.

You really should check out North Dakota farmer Gabe Brown.  In his book, Dirt to Soil, he talks about how he went bankrupt his first 4 years as an industrial farmer, and out of desperation and a lack of funding, accidentally discovered regenerative farming and managed to rebuild himself as incredibly successful and well established farmer, making far more money than he ever could as an indebted industrial slave farmer.

I do NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT want you to stop farming, I do NOT want you to stop raising chickens.  I want you to make the money and find the success I think you and all farmers deserve for their hard work and seemingly endless passion for their craft.

Also I dunno about you, but im about to buy some chicken eggs for 2.50 a dozen from a small informal farm where the chickens go wherever.  Im getting my own birds soon too.

ZeroWaste,fp0nzmy,t1_fp07mbe,1588213160.0,"The problem with intensively farming crops, especially on a large scale and replacing the tradtional role animals played in fertility with machines and chemicals is that is just is not sustainable, and is in fact, degenerating the land. You can rest cropland using CRP, which some of the land i live on is currently under, but nature heals very slowly, and without correct intervention, takes hundreds, if not thousands of years to restore topsoil from tillage.  It would be much better to convert monocrops into highly biodiverse and nature mimicing ecosystems (ALL healthy ecosystems have plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisims) using the 5 principals of regenerative agriculture.

ZeroWaste,fp038ld,t1_fp013gi,1588201654.0,"This information is all well and good but i need to point out a few confounding variables that may affect this number. Do you know if the numbers given also considered that cows grazing in continuously rotating paddocks will actually improve the land over time? So one year of grazing x number of cattle will have different acreage requirements than a few years later when the topsoil has been built up.  Another thing to take into consideration is the existing quality of land. Certain land simply cannot be utilized for anything other than livestock. 

For example, i currently reside on a midwestern farm where maybe 1/4 of the total acrage is being used for corn and soy. The other 3/4ths cannot be used for large scale cropping. Either because the land is too rocky or hilly to run any machinery through. And even if you could it would be horrible for the natural eco system. Billions of animals take refuge in the other 3/4ths of the property. However, I could graze livestock there with no problems, and because they are living off grass and not expensive grains the extra year of fattening up wouldnt be an issue for me.  

Also people should be buying wholesale beef, you can get pasture raised animals for the same price or cheaper than their grain finished counterparts if you buy a side of beef or pork.  Retail and resturaunts are wasteful. This is clearly demonstrating itself with the mass cullings going on as we speak."

My biggest discovery recently was 'slow food'.  Foods that take time and in return provide more nutrients, are more satisfying, and taste better.

Fermented foods are some of the most sought after food throughout humanity.  Most people will say their favorite foods are chocolate, tea, coffee, cheese, sourdough, pickles, wine, soy sauce, kimchi, hot sauce, vanilla, prosciutto, dry aged steak, etc.  

For the first time in over half a decade, I have real sugar and flour in my house, things I used to be terrified of but coveted.  Not to eat, but to age.  These foods are precious because if I want them again I have to wait, which forces me to eat smaller portions.

Healthy food is not restricting, it's enlightening. You have to start by cooking all your cravings.  You want pizza? Cook it.  Cake? Cook it. All from scratch, no pre packaged mixes or heat-and-serve frozen pre made pizza dough. All from single ingredient items.  Flour, sugar, eggs, baking powder, milk, butter.  Ingredients that you really can't just pull out of the bag and binge on.  I mean you could but it wouldn't be very easy.  

You can't cook?  No one was born knowing how to cook.  Your first time making something might not even come out as eatable.  My first ever batch of chocolate chip cookies ended up in the trash.  But I learned what I did wrong and the second batch was tasty!  A success after re trying a previously failed recipe always tastes a little bit better to the chef than it actually does.

Even if you are a regenerative farmer and you grow all your own food and you properly preserve your produce during the wintertime you aren't going to do well.  And then to add biomass to your soil without using manure is going to make things incredibly difficult.  I have been studying various veganic farms and the ones who don't use livestock rely heavily on fossil fuels to cause proper soil disturbance and outsourced fertilizers.

When you envision a perfect environment, it doesn't just have plants on it.  It has animals, fungi, bacteria, and as much symbiosis between all of them as possible.

It doesn't matter if you eat only plants or animals, if you are buying from the supermarket and aren't sourcing your food, ethically speaking you can do better."

I really don't know why vegans keep getting pets that naturally eat animal foods.  They could get a bunny or a guinea pig (they could even rescue these from live poultry wholesalers) and feed it a wonderful diet, shoot, they could rescue a goat or a cow and feed it wonderful forage!

Not sure what he means by the live trade, if he means like huge quantities of animals being improperly transported ridiculously long distances then I absolutely agree.  At his age he probably grew up mostly seeing local communities bartering very small if not individual quantities of live animals among one another.

I don't think he's referring to veganisim being a solution to our destructive farming practices.  Factory farming, at least in my worldview, also extends to highly mechanized, incredibly vast, and chemically treated crop monocultures.

The problem for me is our trajectory is constantly changing, there is a growing movement of regenerative agriculture, and now with this pandemic I have a theory there will be a greater incentive for people to leave the cities we have been packing into for decades if not centuries.  

But the question is ""if we continue at our current rate"".  If you're talking about right now, this very second, or current as in 2 weeks ago, when the city bars and restaurants were open?  Or maybe two weeks from now?

&#x200B;

Vegans would never do it because even though they give them as much if not more money than anyone else, they would have to become a farmer.  

&#x200B;

Vegans claim they care about the animals and the environment but 99.999999% of them will never do more than maybe grow an herb garden.  They think farming is impossible for some weird reason, but it's actually surprisingly possible and practicable if you're willing to sacrifice your consumerist, hyper convenient, industrial urban lifestyle.  Land in remote areas can be dirt cheap or even free if you know who to talk to/work for.  I know a place atm, not a ton of land, but enough for chickens, pigs, maybe goats/a cow or two, and enough extra space for a good sized garden/food forest, with a PRE BUILT HOUSE (admittedly a fixer upper but completely inhabitable) on the premises renting for about 50 bucks a month, and there is a business literally ACROSS THE STREET that is ALWAYS hiring.   And that's just what I know, which isn't much."
AntiVegan,fl0nguh,t3_flewa6,1584711357.0,"I am mixed about this.

On one hand, I think the way we breed dogs in modern society is just abysmal.  There are certain breeds of dogs that serve no purpose other than being an ornamental companion/accessory.  That in and of itself is fine, but then you get these breeds of dogs that have serious health problems and suffer immensely, like pugs and other brachycephalic dogs.

I believe all domestic animals should be bred for purpose and hardiness, this does not just stop at dogs.   We have some livestock breeds that could also stand some serious improvements.  

Industrial, intensively raised pig breeds have no maternal instinct whatsoever and are horrible foragers, many grow too big too quickly, many industrial livestock breeds are susceptible to serious health complications as well.  And to boot, they don't taste as good.  

&#x200B;

I actually agree with vegans on reducing or even eliminating these quantity over quality breeds of animals, whether for our food or companionship.  However I do support people breeding pets for hardiness and intelligence over appearance, and breeding livestock for the same.

 

Many vegans don't know this but many heritage breeds of livestock are actually endangered and if they really care about the animals they should be promoting these breeds.  Heritage livestock is absolutely gorgeous and many breeds have a closer resemblance to their wild counterparts.  Most importantly these animals have to be raised extensively.  Raising heritage animals in confinement just doesn't seem to make any sense.
