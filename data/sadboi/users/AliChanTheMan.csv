I instantly rebuttled, ""Those people?"" To which she replied, ""Yeah, the chinese. That's where the virus came from."" I continue to call her way of thinking racist and how she doesn't say anything about how American tourists from Italy and elsewhere brought it back with them upon returning home swiftly. She then goes on to say how Obama and the Chinese made it in a lab. I say, ""Stop. You're going to make me mad.""(Which was a lie because I was already mad.) 10 minutes later she speaks up and says, ""You didn't have to say that. That was mean."""

wacom,fpl17p2,t1_fpks63n,1588704577.0,"Thank you for your response. C:

I ended up looking at a lot of different products, including some that you mentioned. I guess I should be honest with the internet about what I decided to buy. I ended up feeling like a used, older version of the  MobileStudio would do me well. Yes, it is still expensive and I wouldn't recomend any new artists to buy one right away, but I knew if I didn't buy myself the tablet I really wanted, then I would be disappointed with something like an iPad and probably not use it as much. I also knew if I didnt buy anything at all, I wouldn't upgrade for the next couple of years.

I think the only negative thing that may come out of this is my boyfriend being mad at me for buying anything. I have the money, so I'm not breaking the bank with this decision. I just wish he was more supportive of my hobbies, even when it was pencil and paper.

The Kamvas Pro, I believe, was a close second. However, I felt uneasy making a big purchase with an unfamiliar brand. There were also some negative reviews that complained about light bleed and dead pixels. 

Thanks again for your comment."

It gets hard for me, though, when he spends more and more of his free time with other people and doesnt include me. Heck, even at parties he kinda just leaves me to my own devices, and it makes me feel kid of excluded. I dont think its something he actively tries to do, though.

I'm sure there is some sort of internal struggle happening. Help him understand that he is not a burden to the relationship and that you are there to support him, as he is there to hopefully support you. Look for ways to help him succeed in his goals. 

I suppose what you could do right now is to just reach out to him or his mom and ask if he is okay. The next time you see him, tell him you are there for him, no matter what, and that you love him.
