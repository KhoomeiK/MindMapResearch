telescope,fhneiif,t1_fhn0ib3,1581725691.0,"Let’s say you point your telescope at the Andromeda galaxy. Because the earth is turning you will have to constantly adjust your telescope to keep the galaxy in view. Equatorial mounts align your telescope with the tilt of the earth (once you turn the latitude knob to your latitude). Then you can rotate your telescope along a single axis to track Andromeda (or anything in the sky). The motor I linked to adjusts that knob at the exact rate at which the Earth turns, this keeping your target centered in view. This is important for long exposure photos because it prevents “star trails”.  Google “equatorial mount” for more information. 

It’s a little tricky but anyone can get a hang of it. Feel free to send me questions and I’ll do me best to help! :)"
