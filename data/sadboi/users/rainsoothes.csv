Note that we wouldn't see Revan's face in this movie, he'd have a mask on at all times on screen. The movie would consist of many scenes involving Revan, but the protagonist would actually be either Malak or the Exile, primarily so Revan could maintain the air of mystery around him. I'm leaning more on the Exile however. I would like an innocent yet strong willed pair of eyes for the Mandalorian Wars, seeing her become slowly disillusioned and heartbroken. Malachor in general would be a perfect climax to a movie, both from Exile's point of view and Revan's. Second movie, we read that Revan turned on the Republic and we are informed of his downfall in the title screen. We are then introduced to a new protagonist who behaves differently to Revan, creating a subconscious gap between the two of them. Those who never played the games would simply think that Revan is gone for good, and that Malak is the villain now. The second movie would follow the events of the game, up until the reveal. The third movie would be about Revan accepting his identity and past, meditating on them and trying to move on. Rescuing Bastilla, defeating Malak, all that jazz. The Exile's fate however would be uncertain, and left open.

2 weeks later, I'd announce a TV show about the Exile."

I feel exactly like you described. Alone. Like I'm so distant from everyone else, that we may not even live in the same dimension. Cut off socially, emotionally and mentally. Spiritually, even. I can't make a connection with anyone. I'm just numb all the time. I feel lonely even when surrounded by people, though being around people helps to an insane extent.

I don't know a cure for this, but you may be experiencing slight derealization or depersonalization, which is similar to dr.

It's like every good thing has to be balanced by absolute shit, and every bad thing needs to be double downed on. I remember that I listened to a lecture on something called the ""super ego"" in the past. Basically, if you maybe learn in childhood that you shouldn't feel good (subtly or overtly) you will carry that into adulthood and all the toxic things and ways of thinking you were taught will continue to control your life. I personally rarely bothered with it (most likely because I don't feel like I deserve to be healed) but I hear that healing the super ego CAN be possible. In fact the guy I listened to mentioned an eerily similar story where a client of his started doing better in life, got a gf and a good job, then all of a sudden quit on both of those and insulted the man who helped him... These compulsions run deep.


Anyways the guy who opened my eyes on this and the guy from the story is called Richard Grannon (Spartan Life Coach). He has many many valuable videos on YouTube that deal in Complex PTSD (usually childhood trauma) and he thinks that all the self neglect and self destruction stem from this injured, traumatized super ego. I think his videos can really be a help, at least when it comes to understanding the topic at the very least. He knows his stuff, but it's my fault I never really follow through and attempt at change. I recommend checking his videos out, since I think he's the most knowledgeable youtuber on the topic. Hopefully his vids might be able to provide some insight at least."

I find that it's easier to deal with the urges when you try your hardest to be mindful of all the good things you'd be missing out on, and all the bad things you'll bring on yourself. I know it's difficult to accomplish this in the moment, but forcing yourself to just sit down, take a break and give it a minute or two to try and think things through can help... not a cure by any means, more like a temporary bandaid, and I'll personally still screw up every now and again but it's helped me a few times too.

Or do I integrate them in another way?

And yeah it's possible that this is a result of bad parenting. About the only thing my parents ever did for me was keep food on the table, which fair enough, I thank them for that. It's not that they don't love me, but they were just awful parents all around. Always distant, absent, cold and uninterested. Maybe that's the reason for my self loathing, maybe I think that feeling unimportant and distant IS love, on some subconscious level.

Like no fucking shit, I don't feel good about this situation either, why do you think I even got to this point? For some randoms on the internet to assume that everything can be just fucking dandy in my life and that I should just rethink it (like I haven't done that a million times) comes off less as helpful, well meaning advice, and more as a way for people to pretend that they care. We humans are deeply selfish fucks, so I find it really unlikely that anyone out there gives a shit when they spout something that basically amounts to ""just bee urself, there's light at the end of the tunnel :) :) :)""
People just want to feel like they're good boys/girls and saying highly generic, pseudo supportive messages like that is one way of accomplishing that. Places like this subreddit are different since we can actually share our thoughts and lives to one another and get constructive feedback. But me putting a message like ""you are loved"" on the internet, not even to a specific person, is insensitive and arrogant at best, since I have no fucking clue about other people's lives."

I'm just a terrible piece of work all around. Excuses don't matter, reasons don't matter. Results matter. And I have nothing to show off or be proud of. I don't care about approval of others, but I'm just saying. I'm very unhappy with who I am. And the funny thing is, I know I won't do anything to change that."
