I feel like I NEED to worry about things enough so that they won’t happen... and if I’m not worrying about it i strangely feel like I’m doing something wrong. Part of it I think is that worrying about things makes me supposedly more prepared for when/if they do happen. I want to be able to expect things, even if they’re bad, maybe because I feel more in control then? So I over analyze everything to try and find where things will go wrong before they do.. not the best habit"

I also haven’t been seeing my boyfriend as he is working and I live with my family.

death,fnk0zoo,t3_g0ux6c,1587011890.0,"Ever since I was very young I’ve had this ingrained fear and paranoia of being kidnapped and murdered. I have no idea where it came from, but looking back that was where my battles with anxiety began. I have vivid memories of eyeing older men in stores and making sure they weren’t following me, and waking up every single night in the early morning and just listening for sounds of someone in my house. There were many instances where I was sure I was about to die. I imagined how it would happen over and over. It took a long time for me to realize that wasn’t normal. That anxiety has lessened some over the years, but is definitely still there. I absolutely hate going anywhere alone at night, and I’m always hyper aware of my surroundings. 

Anyways, you’re not alone! Anxiety is a bitch, and it’s great of convincing us that our fears are real."

My dad is apparently a conspiracy theorist, and is now constantly watching videos that portray this whole situation as not being a real threat. He doesn’t think any of these measures being taken are necessary. 

I think it’s important to not succumb to the doomsday mindset, but he’s gone the completely opposite way and it’s driving me crazy. When people think this way they stop being cautious and start putting other people at risk against their wills."

The goal should be to learn to manage it and know your limits. It’s important to have a realistic view, which is where I think this thread comes in. I’m still anxious at times, but coming here feels safe and definitely minimizes it a lot. It may not be for everyone, but they have the choice to not come here then."

Anxiety,floyih4,t1_flox7ql,1585348071.0,"Recoveries require testing negative twice with 24 hours between. From what I’ve heard, which makes sense,  this is not a priority and tends to lag a lot behind actual recoveries. By minimizing the number of recoveries that are reported, the death rate in turn appears higher. The death rate is much more likely to be accurate (aside from the issue of reporting covid-19 as the cause of death for everyone that had it and died) and be reported in a timely manner. Also, correct me if I’m wrong, but even in mild cases it seems that the illness lingers for a while, so testing negative may take weeks, even if one feels they have recovered. Chances are the recovery rate is much higher than those numbers."
Anxiety,flojtde,t1_floj9oi,1585339673.0,"Yes! I meant to say that too. Unfortunately, it seems it takes a while to die from this.. so deaths will likely be occurring for a while past peak."

I looked it up and nationwide lockdown went into effect March 9th in Italy, which granted feels like a year ago, but was just under 3 weeks ago now. So much can change in a week, and it takes time for things to slow down after making these changes. It also looks like restaurants and bars weren’t closed until March 11. Within 2 or so weeks there likely still be people starting to have symptoms who were exposed before these restrictions, and within a longer period some who got infected before might start having more severe symptoms. This is just my interpretation though, hopefully in the next week or so a decline becomes more evident."

My boyfriend doesn’t live far from me, but my family is isolated, and he is still working and having contact with various people on a daily basis. So we made the decision to stop seeing each other for the time being. I’m very anxious not knowing how long this will last, and going from seeing him almost everyday to going weeks or longer without.

It’s especially difficult since my anxiety is so high right now. I wish so badly he was here to comfort me, but I know my efforts are making it so we can be together again soon. I’m just trying to focus on the fact that this is temporary, and on how great it will be when we are reunited. We also agreed we would FaceTime every night, so I know I have that to look forward to in the meantime.

Anxiety,fla755w,t1_fl9zcer,1584978056.0,"If anything I’m this person to my family. Overall I do think it’s a big adjustment for many, which will take time, and likely will include days that are worse than others. 

I think it’s important to give him a little space, while also making it known regularly that you’re there for him. Try to converse with him about what he’s feeling if he seems open to it, or maybe he’d rather talk about a completely unrelated topic. It’s a tough spot to see what is happening to someone when they can’t. Maybe talking to his doctor over the phone or video chat will help?

Is there something he enjoys that you can try to get him engaged in? Maybe you can find a lighthearted show to watch together? Distraction during this time is helpful I’ve found, but not always easy I understand. 

I hope things get better for you all. It’s a very difficult transition for many people, myself included, but things will get better."

He’s a mail carrier so potentially has lots of contact with people on a daily basis. I’m living at home with my family. We’ve been struggling to figure out the best course of action, but have decided that it’s best for now not to see each other for now.

I’m heartbroken over it, and physical touch is also one of my top love languages. I’m just trying to remind myself constantly that it is only temporary and focus on how great it will be when we get to see each other again. Also do make sure to talk to each other about how often you want/need to communicate and by which means (text, phone call, video chat). It sucks having to be in a “long distance” relationship when they aren’t far, but we will get through it.

Anxiety,fl711as,t3_eupik4,1584890914.0,"I know this may seem trivial in the grand scheme of things.. but currently I’m struggling because I just made the decision to isolate myself from my boyfriend.

He lives alone and comes into contact with many people at work every day, so I made the decision to keep a distance for the time being. We’ve never done anything close to long distance, we normally see each other almost everyday. I’m worried about how it will affect our relationship. He drives by my house to get to and from work, it’s so difficult to make this choice, but I know I have to do my part to minimize the spread.

I’m not highly educated on the topic, but we survived the Spanish flu, which was much worse, and that was 100 years ago. There was no spreading of information quickly through the internet (positive and negative aspects), meaning widespread effective intervention likely wasn’t possible (this is speculation). The world was a very different place, particularly in the medical field. Today we have the promising possibility for effective medical interventions to emerge in the near future. And yet even 100 years ago we recovered and moved on from it without these advancements. 

We will get passed this. We will recover. We have to support each other in the mean time and do our part to mitigate the impact."

But then I read more and realized that is what we want, that is the goal of isolation and quarantine. We want to slow the spread, which inevitably will take longer than if we took no action. However, this will also lessen the negative impact on the entire world, which is promising. This gives us time to adapt to our new normal, which we can and will do, while also keeping hope that it will just be temporary. 

Do your best to distract yourself and focus on the positive advancements that are happening every day. And come back here when you need support. We are all in this together."
relationships,erpkoqw,t1_erph6xh,1561120786.0,"Thank you for response. I’ve considered that maybe it is me and I’ve just been unaware to how I’ve been acting. Ever since we graduated I’m the only one whose made any effort to hangout. I made the plans to see their apartment and we were all supposed to go out this weekend, which was originally my idea. In our group chat this friend told our other two friends to bring their boyfriends this weekend, and said nothing of mine, which gave me the first hint she doesn’t like him for some reason. If she had a legitimate reason I’d hope she would tell me privately and from a caring standpoint. 

I value my friendships greatly, and try hard to balance my time, which is much harder now that I don’t live with my friends. I think it’s inevitable that getting into a relationship means you’ll spend less time with other people, that’s just how time works. Not to mention when this friend first met her boyfriend she went to his house every single night, and I said nothing. I let her talk about him as much as she wants, and if somethings relevant I’ll say something about mine. I’m trying hard to see where she’s coming from, but I don’t understand it.
