As others have mentioned, not having a degree isn't a bad thing. School is so expensive nowadays that a degree is not always a logical decision if you want to be financially secure. I know people with six figure debt with law degrees working as indentured servants at big law firms and are absolutely miserable.

As far as living with your mom, I think that's a completely rational financial decision. You are a millennial, and it's very common for people in our generation to live with parents. Before the pandemic, I had plans to move back in with my parents. I cannot justify wasting tens of thousands of dollars on rent when my parents have a perfectly good spare room. So you're already ahead of me there!

As for being single: the older I get, the more I realize that being in a relationship or being married is a fakeout accomplishment. It's MUCH MUCH better being single than being in a bad relationship. I know so many people stuck in terrible relationships who are fucking miserable. I also have been in bad relationships and would rather die alone than be tethered to someone I hate. The ironic thing is, once I made peace with the fact I can die alone, I met my current BF, who is by far the best partner I've ever had. Work on yourself, and the relationships will naturally follow.

Your debt: if you're American, you are not alone in having substantial credit card debt. It's more common than you probably think. Take baby steps. Look at last month's expenses and try to do lower than that by $50 this month. You can slowly make a dent in your debt, no need to rush. 

Good luck to you!"

writing,fmy2eqs,t1_fmxzdd4,1586476675.0,"It's interesting you bring up those two examples because those movies have (IMO) the two most important things for a gripping romance, in spades: (1) tension, and (2) power struggle.

Romances are usually power struggles. This is not necessarily healthy for real-life relationships, but they make for engaging storytelling. For example, in Casablanca, you can tell in the beginning Rick is trying to hurt Ilsa because she hurt him in the past. But Rick won't come out and say that he was hurt or admit that he was vulnerable -- to do so would to be admit weakness. So he takes it out on Ilsa. This also happens a lot in Gone with the Wind.

The best romances have a lot of tension because there is usually some insurmountable obstacle that forces the characters to fight their own feelings for each other. That creates a sense of suspense that heightens chemistry.

I also forgot to add -- if you want an example of a pure, healthy relationship (rare in Hollywood), Up is fantastic. That movie never ceases to make me cry. The ""chemistry"" in that movie wasn't so much sizzling sexual chemistry so much as two people who share a childlike sense of play."
