Keep pushing the point that you felt attacked and wasn’t sure what to say, but wanted to push that you guys had an agreement. Reconnect with her a little and give her a chance to talk things out. As someone who has severe anxiety and can’t stay home because my husband doesn’t make enough money, her set up sounds great. She’s probably happy. The conversation with her friends may have just made her anxious. I could see if you guys had kids where the set up may be a little unfair. I’d expect my husband to help with his minions, but honestly I couldn’t see her being unhappy unless she wants to work but her anxiety is uncontrolled."

It was the hardest thing to watch my brother come over with a black eye, bruises, scratches, etc on a weekly basis while she walked around pampered, but when he put his hands in front of his face to try and stop her once ... she calls the police on him. It was over her not getting the right order from McDonald’s. Luckily I had been there watching my niece for the day and they were coming home. I was able to testify for him and she spat at the officer, and was belligerent while my brother was cool and collected. Didn’t help her case. 

I admit I was pretty naive to the fact that abuse can happen like that, but I fully believe it now. I hate that my brother felt helpless and just took the beatings because she was a woman. He stayed with her for 6 years. That’s how we were raised. I feel totally different now."

You don’t want her there. She sounds like she’s going to stress you out. Your mom can even take a hike, she is sounding not much better. If you don’t even want her at the wedding, tell her to get lost. 

This day is about you and your soon to be husband. It’s what YOU GUYS want. Nothing more and nothing less. This shit is already stressful enough. I remember I broke out like crazy and gained a bunch of weight before the wedding because it was crazy. (not to scare you I’m just super sensitive to that stuff. I do that with anything super stressful) And you don’t need your sister in your ear (or even your mom) chopping on your nerves like that. You need to be uplifted and encouraged. 

My husband and I paid for our wedding and reception and we were upfront with all family members and said only kind, loving people will be invited to sit at our tables. My mom wanted to invite everyone (even people who had abandoned me once my parents divorced, and I said NO). It was about love, and happiness and that’s how we kept it. She eventually got over it. If your mom and sister can’t get over it, cut the chord. Family isn’t always bonded by blood and life is too damn fleeting for that kind of toxicity in your life. I mean, you went to therapy over her.

This is just what I’ve been told, and it may not be the correct way, but it’s worked so far.

These people don’t know what hell an ED can put someone through and I hate you had to read that.  My advice is to try and block out the hate. I try not to ever read any comments on stuff like this, because people can be MEAN. If you feel like it’s effecting you too much, go talk to someone. This has helped me.

It’s hard to stop, but if you keep comparing yourself to your little sister it could damage your relationship with her. Your boyfriend cheated on you because he is an asshole, and you will find someone who loves you that you can have this amazing wonderful life with (my husband who adores me and I just got back from an epic trip to Ireland). 

It sounds like you’re in a low place, but it will get better. Be aware of when you’re comparing yourself and replace those negative thoughts with thoughts of love. It’s hard work but it’s possible. I think your sister would be hurt if she knew you felt that way, because I’m sure she sees the wonderful person you are. 

As for your mom saying that to you, it’s not right, but my mom still comments on my weight. I think it’s engraved in parents brains to worry about their kids and moms know when their kids aren’t generally happy and maybe she’s picking up on that. It may come from a good place. Is it right? No. But consider the source. If you think your parents are just being malicious then you have a right to say it makes you feel uncomfortable and you’d prefer if they didn’t comment on your body.

work,eyri4j7,t3_cydw1i,1567369228.0,"I understand. I’m taking a pay cut to find a job that pays less, but demands that I’m on my feet because a desk job in the city was affecting my health physically and mentally. It was also the office politics and overall work load with impossible deadlines and also not interacting with human beings on the daily. It sounds like stress to me which is normal in a work place, but to some degree you have to weigh the good and the bad and figure out what’s worth it."
askwomenadvice,eyqdlqm,t3_cy0msc,1567338811.0,"I gave up on love for three years until I found my husband at 27.  At that time I was done. Completely. We married when I was 30, but it could’ve taken longer than that. I “dated myself” during that time and tried to just resign myself to the idea that I might always be single. I ended up being okay with it. When I met my husband we had both given up on the idea of love and we were just having fun. We ended up being best friends and so on. 

I had realized that, while dating him, I may have never given him a chance if I were actively looking for romantic love. And not to sound too sappy, but he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. 

It’s okay to resign yourself to the idea that you may never find love, but be open to it when it does happen. It can happen at any age and at anytime when you least expect it."
BingeEatingDisorder,eyo71gm,t3_cxsrhw,1567271198.0,"I just started Vyvanse today after my insurance finally approved it for my BED and I usually feel compulsive about food, but so far I’m fine. 

I think I’ll be bummed out too when that happens if it makes you feel any better. Food has been my coping mechanism for years."
sex,eymkdhq,t3_cxlroj,1567211608.0,"I had a boyfriend who was a bit smaller than average (Almost your size exactly). He was amazing though and I could definitely feel it, so I can’t relate to your girlfriend. I do have to say that this is probably coming from the best place possible for her even though it doesn’t excuse it. 

I can also say from experience that the last thing I would ever want to say to my partner is “Hey babe, are you in? I can’t feel anything.”  Even if the guy was porn star huge I wouldn’t say it. Especially if I knew my partner was insecure about his size. 

Also, you obviously care about her satisfaction, and that’s really cool of you. The boyfriend who was on the smaller size dedicated his time to foreplay. Like would suffocate himself down there and almost torture me with making me cum so much kind of foreplay. It was a power play on his part. He would also thrust hard and fast and put me in positions where my G spot was at the center of attention. The G spot is my weakness since it’s my most intense spot. I was always satisfied and I’ve been with big before and they couldn’t even always say that. 

One last thing: never discount how amazing it feels for women to have a man’s hips thrust on us. Any type of vibration is good and your balls could have been hitting her clit. I cum just off of that sometimes. 

My advice? Talk to her. Let her know it’s not about your ego, but about her wanting to be satisfied and happy with you and work together as a couple to see how you guys can get there."
BingeEatingDisorder,eymi3xh,t1_eymhx3p,1567209733.0,You’re welcome. I really hope the best for your son and you in this situation.  Best of luck!
BingeEatingDisorder,eymgk41,t3_cxmu7j,1567208479.0,"Okay, so from someone who has a binge eating disorder I can almost certainly say it’s most likely because he’s hurting. I’ve been in therapy uncovering a lot of the hurt and a lot of things have been clicking for me. This is what I’ve realized for me (so I’m not necessarily saying it’s for your son too), but when speaking with the therapists in my program they are saying it’s pretty similar for everyone. 

Binging is a form of self harming. It’s an addiction. The sicker I get the better because it’s a way to avoid my feelings. I also dealt with abuse as a kid. I saw my dad being a drug addict and how it made him mean. I also saw both my brothers go through this. So food was my socially acceptable thing to go to, but now it’s classified as an addiction. There are even OA meetings for it all over the nation. And it’s not exactly easy giving up food since we need it, but I’m learning the addiction is more in the process of binging not necessarily the food itself. 

When my mom tried to confront me on this when I was younger I would immediately get defensive. She was a good mom, but the truth is I didn’t want to stop or didn’t think I could. It was something that I was super sensitive to. I think any teenager may not be totally receptive to their parents confronting them, but I would definitely reach out to his therapist if possible. I know that may not be possible because of his age now. Maybe if you explained that you’re worried about him? If you do approach him use “I” statements and try not to use blaming words with him because like you said, there’s a TON of shame in this.  My therapist advised if ever approaching anyone about their behavior it’s better to make it about you (for example: I’ve been worried about you because I love you. I just want to make sure you’re okay.,etc.) My mom when she approached me was super blaming and made it about my weight and appearance. She was harsh with her words and it didn’t feel like it was coming from a place of love. I wasn’t super receptive to her concern because of the way she presented it. So my advice is to approach it with love which I know you probably will. I’m just speaking from my own personal experience. 

I hope this helps. I’m not an expert but I’ve been haunted by it since I was 8.  I saw your response to another commenter and the way he’s being secretive about it and it’s large quantities of food makes me think it could be binge eating, but again I’m not a therapist."

relationship_advice,eyjwot9,t3_cx7vr0,1567130288.0,"Not only is this crossing a fuckton of boundaries but it is scientifically inaccurate. I’m sorry for your loss, but no way. If that’s the condition of marriage then I would say no. It’s you alone with several men seeing you naked and it feels like they are treating you like a piece of meat, a product. Let’s make sure the product is not defective until we buy or sign the papers. A bunch of men, opening your legs to check your most private part... are they fucking doing this to him? Are they holding him accountable in some way? Are they going to fucking unclothe him and make sure he isn’t “defective”?? Fuck no. Fuck this. Fuck this so much! Please don’t do this. We, as women need to fight this. This is not the fucking caveman ages. It was fucking wrong then and it’s fucking wrong now. 

It sounds like a old bunch of men wanting to see a young girl’s private’s. How could anyone agree to this? How can he even ask this of you?? 

My advice is fuck no."
