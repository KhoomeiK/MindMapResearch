depression,fr32l0h,t1_fr3127y,1589848674.0,Don't worry about figuring out and trying to find out how many times it's happened or not. It's not a healthy route for you to go down.

I've definitely felt like nobody cares about me. It's an awful feeling I understand.

I believe this whole covid thing is having a bad impact on many people's mental and emotional health. You deserve a good life. I really do hope you'll see good days in your future. Everyone has their own experience with this situation. Don't mind them, since that's their life and not yours. You should really take this time to focus on taking care of yourself. You can look for resources where you live to reach out for support, to better cope with this. There are people seeking professional for this sort of thing. I can't really say how many people are doing it, but I don't doubt it.

I wish you all the best! You deserve to be surrounded by good people. Please be safe out there! I appreciate your hard work!"
depression,fqm3k87,t1_fqm3ceg,1589470899.0,"Even worse if they are drug or alcohol addicts :(  No problem stranger!

Edit: I have no idea why I was downvoted?? All I said was how if there's drug addicts getting that free money, it's not good at all. Why? Because it will make them want to keep buying drugs even more (depends on the person, so not everyone), and continue their unhealthy lifestyle. The money is better suited for people who won't continue to do drugs, and for anyone who aren't drug addicts. It's common sense people and logic!!"
depression,fqm3dtb,t1_fqlpuza,1589470813.0,"Please keep in mind any essential worker, be it hospital related or not, we are risking our lives. I'm not a hospital worker, but I am protecting myself at work. Just know that somewhere out there, there's people who do appreciate any essential worker whether we are directly praised or not. We may be going quietly unnoticed, but there's still people out there appreciating other kinds of essential workers whether we know this or not (which I why I said going ""quietly appreciated). I know this crisis is causing many to feel so unhappy, so unappreciated, forgotten, depressed, trust me I know. I do suffer from depression and anxiety. I know exactly how it feels like to not feel appreciated.

We can only do the best we can, being safe, and to survive. We should try not to focus too much on how much praise we need in general in order to feel happy. Because the more we focus on letting that be our only source of happiness, the more unhappy we will become. We should fill those gaps with things we enjoy doing, to try to boost our moods, and surround ourselves with good people.

I see from the other comments, that you work in HR. You are at the center of a lot of things happening there with many people, and an assortment of responsibilities. We may not feel appreciated (I work a different job) and not get as much attention as hospital staff, but we're still out there working, risking our lives too.

I think we're just going quietly appreciated since we aren't told directly. You don't have to believe me. I know it sucks to not feel appreciated, but hey if it's worth something to you, I appreciate what you do, and I hope you stay stay safe! I know this was long, but I felt like reaching out to you. I wanted to offer you some hope, that there is people out there like me, who do appreciate non-hospital related workers too. Take care stranger! Please be safe! :)"

I feel bad for her. So yes, I totally agree that there is definitely room to grow! It's great you are growing as an artist! She's definitely a hard boiled egg!

She is making herself look like a jerk. People should get vaccinated so that they don't get sick.

It makes me sad there's people out there like this who strongly believe getting vaccinated doesn't do anything. I just hope this pandemic stops at some point soon. People need to appreciate everyone who is working essential jobs. They are risking their lives, providing services to people. Don't be like this woman in the photo and embarrass yourself!

Is the one person infected, in your hospital? Or did you mean in your town in general (like ""community"")? It's really good that people at work and your town are taking extra precautions to be safe, even when it hits your hospital.

I've seen people use the elbow tap in place of handshakes too. I hope this pandemic will begin to slow down here. There's too many infected in my country (USA)."

People get busy with jobs, family, online classes, and other things, but it still would be nice to hear from any of my friends. The more they don't reach out the me, the more discouraged I feel to not make an effort to reach out to them. It gets really tiring being the only one making the effort to text, when they don't make an effort at all. There's something about the other person making an effort that feels really nice though. It makes me feel appreciated."
