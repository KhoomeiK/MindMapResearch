Cadbury and Hershey's, for example, are generally milk chocolate or lower chocolate content with higher sugar. Baking chocolate is generally bitter because it's meant to be combined into desserts with added sugar, and generally fat.

However, unless your Easter candies actually list themselves as bittersweet or 70%+ cocoa, then it might actually just be low quality chocolate with sugar already. Melting it down and incorporating it into brownies with cocoa powder (if you have it), is an option. Basically, you'll want it to be the less prominent flavor. 

When you tried it as hot chocolate, did you add extra sugar?"

BackToCollege,ficert4,t3_f7mzpi,1582345016.0,"Hi!

First of all, look into if your company has any kind of educational reimbursement. Some companies do but to specific institutions, so that may be a bit of guidance. (Unless you've looked into this already, of course).

Second, I'd recommend staying away from for-profit schools. Look at state schools or well known public institutions that are offering programs online. For example, Arizona State and Penn State have online schools and are respected and accredited. You also may want to look into local community colleges that have transfer options to 4-year. Those can be cheaper and often full of nontraditional students, and many are working toward online options, so it doesn't hurt to look into it.

Also, is there a specific reason you want a bachelors degree? If it's within your field, will it give you a pay bump? Or a chance of advancement? Or is it just for your own personal goals? Look into jobs related to specific degrees or consider concrete goals, then select the degree plan that works. For example, IT may not give you any possibility of advancement (or it may, depends on circumstances)."

I don't know your husband, but I know mine. And once he started getting help for it, such huge changes started to happen. For the first time in his life he was literally able to even try to plan things. He was able to be present. He was able to act on his wants. I don't think i could actually understand the level that ADHD prevented him from doing even the things he wanted to, the things he valued. Not until I saw him actually be able to, anyway. 

It's not perfect. It's far from perfect. The meds help, but it doesn't cure it. It's still a struggle. It still takes trying new meds, new routines, accepting that many times the ADHD will win. But seeing the times when the real him shined through and seeing he could care...even in moments like you just had where yours actually tried, those changed so much for me.

BackToCollege,fdba5nl,t3_ekfoqm,1578255388.0,"CS student in a pretty competitive/challenging program and former community college CS/Math tutor here. 

First of all, it's generally required that you give transcripts of all prior college/university classes you've taken when applying to a new one. So just starting new isn't entirely an option. However, in many cases, your credits will transfer without their associated grades (for passing and accepted classes), so you can have a fresh start at the GPA an employer will eventually see. 

My advice would be to start out at a CC to get yourself into the grove, especially with the math and foundational classes. Work hard to show the effort you're putting in and that can be taken onto account when transferring. Depending on where you want to transfer to, the university may also have specific transfer programs that you follow to get in. For example, i transferred to Penn State from a CC where i was able to be guaranteed acceptance into the CS program if i worked with a Penn State advisor while at the CC and took specific classes.

Some universities also have programs that allow you to earn an AA at a CC first, then transfer in with that. This might be a good option to consider too, because depending on the CS job you want, some will actually take you on with just the AA. This could either be a career starter for you or help you pay for a BS, especially if a company offers tuition reimbursement. 

Also, why are you sure you want CS, if you don't mind me asking? Is it money? A love of coding? What type of job do you want? Some schools also have different degree paths, such as Information Systems that are half programming and half business. This can be an alternative to a traditional CS if you are not into a very heavy math curriculum."

ADHD_partners,f8pt0w5,t1_f8p71na,1574706829.0,"This. Married almost 6 years, been close for almost 8. First several years of marriage was me mothering him, though not to change him against his will - it was always the changes he wanted to make, but he ended up relying on me to manage them.

The last year or so, though, has been hugely different. He finally got into treatment and diagnosed and he sees why i was frustrated for so long. He actively tries to prioritize me even when it goes against his regular behavior, or communicates when he's struggling with it.

It's never going to be a ""normal"" adult relationship, but when willing and work is put in, it can still be a very rewarding one."
Marriage,f80rk5f,t1_f806c8l,1574136348.0,"Not saying this is the case for OP, but i wouldn't rule out the possibility it's a mental health coping mechanism too. Before i learned better strategies, disappearing was how i stopped a panic attack from escalating. It wasn't always easy/possible from my POV to express this. 

Definitely not common and definitely something to clear up, but i think there may be reasonable explanations too, especially since OP mentioned mental health struggles."

Can you look up local support options while he's at work? Maybe see if there are any women's groups that may be able to show you some options?"

Marriage,f7dgr3a,t1_f7dexl7,1573616368.0,"I think sometimes the compromise choices are the hardest part. It's so much easier when there's a clear ""right"" or ""wrong."" The grad programs I'd be looking at would likely add around 6 years since it would be research/STEM-based PhDs.   
I've debated taking some gap time but I'm concerned I'll end up not going back, especially if I ended up with kids or in a comfortable life routine. Did your wife end up completing it later? If so, was she glad she waited?

My husband is more than willing to continue to support me and honestly wants me to continue on, but I don't think he fully grasps the stresses it might entail yet. He's more the type who'll understand while it's happening. If I just got the BS and had kids, I'd likely still be working, just in a compromise type job. His dream is for me to finish, get my dream job, then we flip and I support him while he goes back for grad school. As it stands, he does not feel he could while working."
Marriage,f7dg6l8,t1_f7dcn0g,1573615932.0,"I appreciate the concern. :) Thankfully, this is not my situation. I have a solid STEM-related work history with recommendations and will have a BS in Computer Science in under two years, so employment is not a concern. This is purely to achieve more of a dream career than any career at all. This may not have come across because of my mention of the GED and such, but that was just because I was homeschooled and never got a formal diploma. My husband and I also have ""escape"" plans in place in case anything ever did fall apart in our marriage (his idea because I was moving countries and he is aware of the concerns you expressed). 

The bigger concern is more that I'll have to put aside a lot of the marriage goals/relationship goals for probably another 8 years, if not a bit longer because the field I'd be working in would be very hard for the first few years. I'm basically trying to decide whether my ""dream"" is really the job or the marriage. Not that I wouldn't work or have an education, just that maybe I would pick one with a more doable work/life balance if it meant ruining my marriage."

Marriage,f777c01,t3_dullaz,1573446033.0,"First of all, as hard as it is right now, it is very normal to be feeling overwhelmed and upset. Both about moving to the US and about what he said.

I immigrated from Canada almost 6 years ago on a fiance visa and it was really hard. It actually took us several years to really get through the adjustment and for me to figure out who I was in this new life. Talking is important. Therapy helped us get through some of the issues. It's a very big adjustment for both of you, and it can be easy to have imagined things would be different when long distance.

As for the emotional cheating, I agree with the other comment that said crushes happen regularly. They do. And it's okay too, as long as its discussed. Sometimes it can be a sign that something is missing in the relationship that can be fixed, like his feeling uninspired by you.

Do you have any plans for when you do get your employment authorization? Is there anything the two of you want to do in the future? Is there something he really wants that you could help him with? While you're not working, it can be a good time to come up with plans and do anything else that's helpful."

I've had a lot of success with buying him experiences he wouldn't normally treat himself to. :) Sometimes that can be as simple as taking a bit of time to find a new restaurant he might really like (ex. he loves sushi, i do not, bit I have a list of sushi places with other menu items). It's not the same as coming home with a physical present, but coming home to suggest a fun dinner or something is similar."

I generally agree with the advice in the comments already, that talking to him and simply saying, ""hey. Could we just...cuddle?"" Every time might make a huge difference. This isn't really a sit down and talk about it thing. It's a showing by actions thing, especially if there's any chance he's taking your upset personally. And i also super second the self sooth thing. I've seen emotional dependency ruin so many marriages. The healthy ones sooth themselves and, often, that can also open doors to more intimacy too."

environment,f3oks2n,t1_f3obq7n,1571020594.0,"Again, I said I agree that we need to make people listen. It was specifically the latent consequences of *how* we protest that may not be as useful for the cause. It's important to find ways that strongly impact the ones who can make significant change more quickly which then can enable those who cannot afford to miss a days work to have more climate-friendly options.

I understand that none of this will matter when the climate gets worse. I'm not advocating to stop protesting or that everyone should not be aware and try their best. I'm just saying preventing someone from getting to work does not enable them to help the cause if it causes them to miss rent, not be able to pay for medications, etc. Losing your home can certainly impact a person's ability to protest, to make environmentally smart choices, etc. 

Don't get me wrong, this movement is needed. But being aware and compassionate to the pain the movement itself may cause goes a lot farther in gaining support than saying we don't care if you lose your house because it'll be destroyed anyway."
environment,f3nsed7,t1_f3npkg2,1571001784.0,"While I agree, it's not feasible for many people to just suddenly throw their way of life away either. For example, people who cannot afford to move and can only get to their job via a car because public transportation isn't an option and it's too far to bike/walk because their city was planned for cars. 

They may have long term goals of reducing their driving footprint but in the meantime would end up unable to survive without the job they must commute to. Although it's a different country, consider how many people would be in financial ruin in the US if they miss more than a day or two of work. 

Yes, there are many people who are doing it out of convenience. But there are also legitimate people who cannot change some habits in the near future and their impact is very small compared to the large companies. 

Not saying we shouldn't protest and *make* people listen, but strongly affecting the class that genuinely needs to get to work or lose their home isn't necessarily going to gain more support from some classes."
MealPrepSunday,f3gywxj,t1_f3fwnn8,1570916692.0,Thank you so much. I have a family member who has been struggling with homelessness for a couple years now and it makes such a huge difference to her when someone gives even a bit. There's been days she's gone with nothing at all because she wasn't near any charity options (not in a big city). Even a small snack goes a long way.
