Don't let that shit fester, it's been years now and he's slowly trying to rebuild contact and it's tough. As kids we've grown up and moved out to different countries, there's no way that he'll ever have the kind of relationship we have with our mother. 

So yeah, really just pay attention, it doesn't have to be huge but being present--physicaly and mentally--means a lot. Help with homework, housework, give advice. I think, at least from what I saw, a big gesture or activity for everyone to do together, probably won't work, at least it didn't with us.

bodyweightfitness,fdf2hlw,t1_fdey3sf,1578351807.0,">if you train too much at a pace that is too fast for you at the moment,

Idk, I'm just not good at pushing myself that hard if I'm out of breath then that's that, so pace wise I don't see how I could run too quickly.

It's the distance that worried me, it's what dictates how many times your feet impact the ground. The stress to my muscular/bone system, if it's the same for 5hr and 4hr then I'm fine. It's an endurance difference at that point. Also I get that I have to be careful to not run while overly exhausted and sloppy to minimise injury risk.

> If you run “hard” all the time, it won’t work. Better slow and healthy than fast and injured...

Idk what to think now, you've got the experience but that's different to how my plan is layed out. 

Only distance runs--once a week--are slightly slower 10-30 seconds than final race pace. These range from 10-35km. 

The other two days it's shorter runs at a much higher pace, one day is sprinting very short distances, 400m to 1.6km. 

It could be a difference in training philosophie, I've also got a much lower weekly milage then you, max it goes to 50km, which I guess makes up for the higher pace, idk how all this is supposed to work.

This is the first bit of serous running I've done in a while, so I'll re-evaluate the goal after few more weeks and see where I adjust to.

Also the plan difference between 4hr and 5hr is just the pase per km, the milage stays the same; so I'm not too worried about over running or anything. If I'm consistently 30second off the 1km time it's the same as if I was training for the 5hr."

Imo, the exercise/sport of choice is almost irrelevant. Most important is to pick something you can and will actually do. Then stick to it and really push yourself while doing it. 

As swimming is a no go, I'd do some running, you can incorporate some stretches/yoga before each run as well. Skill work as a break in the middle if you like.
