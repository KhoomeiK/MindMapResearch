astrologymemes,flv8zxt,t3_fr7ykg,1585518879.0,"I’m a Pisces and many of the cancers I’ve met have been pretty emotionally manipulative ... I see through the bullshit and they’re threatened and cut me off, lol. I’m also an Aries moon/Sag rising so maybe I just don’t want to give them the time.

I like scorpios, but like cancers I see through their mysterious veil and usually read them pretty well. That’s why we end up being friends. They can handle it and we connect while cancers whine about it. 

Also, I don’t hate cancers lol. I love their emotional depth and kindness. My boyfriend is a cancer rising and it’s what drew me to him in the first place. I just find they have a natural tendency to manipulate if they feel like it."
raisedbynarcissists,flojn1k,t3_fpwqok,1585339574.0,I'm staying w/ my boyfriend's family and they are SOOO nice. His mom is so sweet and cooks all the time. We all hang out and play board games and watch movies together. I'm grateful I'm here instead of my house for quarantine but it just reminds me how different my mom/family is. Not like I expect her to cook and stuff but like... at least do things together. My family would never lol
BPD,flnulsw,t3_fpp7g6,1585326176.0,"I’ve been staying with my boyfriend’s family in a different state from my own. They live in a small town and it’s much safer. My family is abusive and I’ve come to find out the source of my depression. Since being here, I don’t feel the same pain and anxiety. I’m still scared, of course, my boyfriend and I both lost our jobs and are now working to break a lease, but I’m so happy to be away. I’m not glad it happened by any means, but without this I would still be struggling to the degree I was before. I nearly wanted to die and that feeling has dissipated. I feel guilty that it was due to terrible circumstances."

BPD,fkuwuua,t3_fkpyd6,1584557639.0,"This is me entirely It’s EXHAUSTING. I found out who his ex is through digging and fb stalking. I am literally filled with rage. He doesn’t even know I know who she is. The thing is, from what I can tell, the hooked up and spent time together for a long time after they ended it. He moved to the state I live in last year and would frequently visit his home state to see her when he went to visit family. There’s also a pic of them hanging out on his Instagram THREE DAYS before we went on our first date. Like it was so recent what if he still thinks about her?? It seems like they had more in common when it comes to hobbies too. I feel like an immature child but I fucking hate it. I don’t think I’ll ever change lol.

I’ve also done so much thorough stalking that if he mentions and old “friend” or tells a story mentioning a “friend” and not naming them I know for a fact it’s about her and I’m thinking like... cool sounds like a lame time that must’ve sucked."
BPD,fkor5qy,t3_fjpdbl,1584393291.0,"I feel like I’m going to go crazy soon. I’ve had the urge to drink a lot more and took a swig of vodka around 1:30 pm today. Like it’s only been 3 days so far and I’m already doing this? I still get up early and clean, etc so I feel less shitty about myself, but then I just end up sitting on my laptop or watching tv. I used to go to the gym everyday and now I don’t have that. I’m scared of spiraling down a hole."
BPD,fkk2ybm,t3_fiymrl,1584271339.0,I believe it’s called maladaptive daydreaming. I definitely have it and it’s extremely frustrating lol.
raisedbynarcissists,fkj06zg,t1_fkizuim,1584232845.0,I keep thinking maybe they’re right and I’m just dramatic and sensitive. My therapist reminds me it’s abuse every session.
BPD,fkebkk5,t1_fkeaivh,1584109693.0,It’s really getting on my nerves haha. I told him so have asthma and I’d be more likely to get it and he’s still like “well maybe you just shouldn’t come here bc it’s not my problem”
raisedbynarcissists,fkc5mu1,t3_fhl9dm,1584046254.0,"Yeah dude. I’m a nonviolent person, but when I was a little girl I would sometimes imagine what it would be like to fuck up my dad when he would barged into my room screaming. One time he scared me so much I grabbed a pair of safety scissors (lol) and hid them behind my back. 

I’m writing this out for the first time and it’s so fucked up to think about.

I think I thought about stabbing specifically because I have memories of my mom doing things like taking a knife and stabbing it into the fridge when she was angry. Another time in the car she said “If I had a knife I would stab you right now”

Welp"
BPD,fkc516y,t3_fhkc73,1584045919.0,"I know how much this sucks but if you do get paid a lot try your best to stick it out. It’s only going to make your life easier when you move overseas. Coronavirus just gives you more time to save. Just focus on how much more financially responsible taking this route is. 

I know you’ve probably already done this, but keep figuring out how to keep yourself busy at work without going insane. You’ll thank yourself later."
BPD,fkc4ohp,t3_fhmxim,1584045723.0,"I do it all the time lol. Luckily my boyfriend understands and I don’t think he really cares. He’s just like “Of course why wouldn’t I?”

BPD,fkbal0w,t3_fhgbp2,1584029385.0,I think it a concerning that people even want to see that to such an excess. Freaks.
astrology,fkalifv,t3_fguj6z,1584012592.0,"Sagittarius rising. I’m great at meeting new people, I’m very personable and always make people laugh. Sounds weird, but I pretty much always know exactly what people want to hear, but I say whatever I want regardless. Thoughtfully, of course. I just have a natural knack for charming people. A lot of people like it, some don’t. However I don’t always think before I speak and often times end up saying at least one thing I regret, lol. Sometimes I feel obnoxious. 

I still have a lot of social anxiety, tho. The process of getting myself prepared for social interaction is taxing. I get nervous if I don’t have a friend or my boyfriend by my side in a lot of situations. I also think too hard about every one of those interactions. I’m a Pisces sun so that might have something to do with this lol.

I come off as confident and funny, and it sometimes feels false. I’m an incredibly emotional person. It probably seems like I don’t give a fuck when I definitely do. My skin is thick yet paper thin. Kind of hard to explain. Sometimes it’s like I’m putting on a show, but it’s so natural. 

I put a lot of effort into appearance. I want to look good. I always make sure my outfit and my face/hair are together. I’m probably a little bit vain, idk. I’m 5’5 but always wear some type of heel, so let’s say I’m 5’8. I’ve dyed my hair every color but now I like sticking with my natural blonde. I’m built pretty thin, with a vague hourglass shape."
raisedbynarcissists,fkaj8v8,t3_fhc2bo,1584010286.0,Lol I was just telling my boyfriend if the virus gets worse we’d have an excuse to go to his home state 6 hrs away b/c parents live in a really small town. Like its so bad living with them I’d rather there be a pandemic so I can get out. Smh.

raisedbynarcissists,fk8y276,t3_fgxhlj,1583965008.0,Great way to put it honestly. Why am I in therapy and struggling everyday if I'm the bad guy???
raisedbynarcissists,fk8wyh7,t1_fk89z1g,1583964447.0,"Honestly, now that I think about it this is what my parents have done. If I react to anything in a way they see as unsavory or simply disagree with them they blame it on my mental illness."
raisedbynarcissists,fk8wqxn,t3_fh0cvy,1583964333.0,"Yep. I have bipolar and bpd and my parents imply that I'm weak and attention seeking. Esp with bpd, I wish they never found out I had it. The stigma is that everyone w/ it is manipulative and attention seeking, which I know I'm not. Mine is based in identity issues, fear of abandonment, extremely low self-image etc, etc. 

They claim my childhood was perfect and that I had no more problems than anyone else. They live in a delusion. They've nearly convinced me that maybe I am just attention seeking. Without my therapist explicitly calling what I experienced emotional abuse, I would be so lost. It's painful. They've demonized me and made my sister hate me. I'm sick of being pinned as the manipulative liar. I'm out here trying my best."
BPD,fk8g7ki,t3_fgzkv6,1583955447.0,"My university also suspended classes, and apparently one of our professors contracted it. It's super concerning to me, but I think the reactions are so annoying.

Some are like ""More people die from the flu there's no need to worry"" which is ignorant, misguided, and dangerous. Then you have people like my parents, doomsday preppers who almost seem like they want it to happen. I can't fucking stand them. Every time I express concern or worry they make it worse. They want me to stay with them if we're quarantined and I am sure as hell not doing that. 

11 people in my city have been diagnosed in 3-4 days. I'm too scared to go to the gym which is making my ED brain go crazy. Now that classes aren't in session I'm not forced to get up and go anywhere which will inevitably make my depression worse. I have a gnarly cough and a sore throat and now I'm convinced I'm dying lol."

unpopularopinion,fk46tt1,t3_fga998,1583854502.0,"I've spent a lot of time debating the existence of god. What I've found is the question isn't as easy as ""Is there a god or isn't there?"" We'd first have to define what god is. God is different in every belief system and philosophy. The concept of god takes on different forms. 

In the end, god led to religion, which has provided humans an outlet for tradition, community, and spiritual fulfillment for thousands of years. It's natural for people to gravitate toward it. Humans are scared, and we are social creatures. We thrive off of intimacy and community. Religion has promised humans that safety. 

Although I don't deny the existence of god, I'm not a religious person. It's unproductive and immature to needlessly attack people for their belief system. You aren't going to make a rift in the conversation with antagonizing, dog-brained comments. The truth is, no one cares. Lol."

BPD,fjktq7o,t3_fdy099,1583433717.0,"I feel this. I have a history of abusive, withholding partners. I was obsessed with trying to make these people love me, as if overcoming that feat would give me confidence or power or sense of respect.

Now that I'm in a healthy relationship with someone who treats me well, someone I plan on marrying, I'm like ""Well why are his standards so low? Is he with me just because he's insecure and doesn't know he can do better? Is something wrong with him? Is he an idiot?"" And the thing is, there's nothing wrong with him. I just don't have the opportunity to be a masochist who devalues herself by trying the win the respect of someone who will never care. Admittedly it's probably Freudian or whatever b/c I had narcissistic parents who emotionally and verbally abused me my whole childhood, lol.

Now matter how happy you are in the relationship, you will probably ALWAYS feel some sense of discomfort. It sucks but honestly I just try my best to ignore it."
BPD,fjheh1s,t1_fjhdy7c,1583346546.0,It sucks I’m sick of it lol!! I especially hate when I vent about it to a friend and they’re like “yeah well everyone feels insecure sometimes”

BPD,fjh4x56,t3_fde3zz,1583341306.0,"I had a similar experience with my family. My dad is a clinical narcissist and my mom is manipulative and cold. I wasn't the most well behaved child, but despite my softness and kindness and empathy, I was treated like an evil person. What was truly a frustrating disorder was postured an incurable character flaw.

When the continued notion that you are ""bad"" is beat into your psyche throughout your adolescence, you become at odds with yourself. Despite these innate empathic attitudes, you are taught that your *perceived* behavior is incurable. Naturally you will begin to conform to this idea of yourself. Thus the internal battle begins.

In my experience, this contributes to BPD symptoms. 

Recognize that you are doing better by identifying and correcting your maladaptive reactions, that's all you can really do. What's important is to stop negatively labeling yourself as it implies that these actions cannot be resolved. Few things are permanent, this is not one of them. 

Focus a little more on what you like about yourself. If you are kind and caring, emphasize those traits. Be proud of them.

You may struggle with emotional control, insecurity, identity, etc... like most of us do, but these things aren't a reflection of your true character. Change isn't impossible. You aren't bad."

NarcissisticAbuse,fj1u7qc,t3_faywb5,1582927875.0,"I honestly think this can apply to non-narcs too. Low self esteem has a lot to do with it.

Eventually it’s natural. I go to school, go to the gym, come home. I don’t work right now so on my off days I go to the library and sit in the back alone. I just go on robot mode. It helps me get things done. At the end of the day I reward myself by veg-ing the fuck out because one can only do so much. Once I’m productive I don’t feel so bad about doing absolutely nothing at the end of the day. I also usually dedicate one weekend day to wallowing. It helps."
