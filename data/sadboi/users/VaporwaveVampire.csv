Accutane,fqse08o,t3_gkm3ak,1589604754.0,Accutane lasts in your system for awhile. The dry skin side effects (from what I read) start to really go away after a month based on what I read. Plus quarantine isn‚Äôt helping in terms of mood. Definitely talk to your derm if it doesn‚Äôt go away or gets worse
Accutane,fqsd8jb,t3_gkdxp0,1589604194.0,You skin looks so smooth! Also you have my dream brows
