malementalhealth,fjfzewa,t3_fcstcx,1583305183.0,"What I have learned in CBT is to watch my feelings more closely. Every situation or action will result in a feeling. Usually I take that feeling and start thinking how to react. But thinking while you are sad results in a very bad view on the situation and you interpret words not correct. So than you start to ""overthink"" as others pointed out already.

Look out for help and start talking about those thoughts. Nobody knows that you have them, so nobody can help you. Opening up to everyone helps, but in the same time you should seek professional help. This enables you to keep up the communication about those feelings and thoughts.

So it is something that I can relate to in many points. As the articles points out many depressed people tend to be not able to talk about feelings and getting involved in those thoughts very much. For me it was the same, so I was reading about a lot of different types of psychological diseases.  Again and again I was like: I have this and I have that. All this reading didn't help me further, because we can relate to a lot of things we are doing. But identifying the real source of your problems can be only done by opening up. 

What I have learned through out the last year that it really helps to have a partner or a professional that I can fully open up. While speaking out loud anxious thoughts of what people think about me, I realized how tangled my thoughts are and that it sounds weird and somehow wrong. 
A process that helped me further on is a partner that listens very quietly and ask the right reflective questions like: ""how certain are that this person thinks that about you"" or ""is there another way how you can interpret the situation""."

So coming back to your question: I am regocnizing a lot of different behaviors already like: judging, being a know-it-all, telling yeah that's what I wanted to say. Maybe I am judging me to hard, I don't know. I realized that it always takes some time until I understand in what sense my behavior was cruel.

- look for a therapist
- check if medication can help you
- meet friends regularly (just 1 person is a good start) 
- look for a hobby (e.g. choose a certain sport that you do 2-3 times in a week)
- look for a job or change if it's too much or not enough workload
- mediation also helps a lot of people

Last but not least I can suggest the following. Go straight to them and ask: ""what are you gossiping about, I love it, can I join?"" either they let you join or they realize how dump this behavior is. I would assume that they don't want to talk too loud so that nobody feels disturbed."

I understand that it is not easy to answer the HR questions, but this usually does not decide whether you will get the job or not, but there is one exception:

If you are really underperforming in answering those questions, nobody will like you. So if you show that you feel uncomfortable to answer a question, your interviewers (and you too) will see that."
