depression,fbttjlr,t3_ee58qm,1577095075.0,"I don't speak to my family of origin anymore, not since they kicked off just before and at my wedding.

We don't choose our family, we don't choose who raises us, it is random chance.  It's unfortunate and unfair.

The thing I'm trying to learn now is life is unfair.  It just is.  And you have to live with it and make the most of it.  I try not to think of that, what about the kids who are born into super poor countries in the East and their parents let foreigners rent them and do what they want with them because they need the cash.

Life is unfair, some people turn to Jesus, some people turn to drugs and alcohol, and some people can't deal with it and off themselves.

Just take one day at a time, screw your family, get away as soon as you can and close up entirely to anyone who makes fun of you.  You don't need to share your stories and secrets with evil people.

Focus on your own happiness and make sure you can love yourself before you go and try and love someone else.

I'm at a stage where I want consciousness but would rather not feel anything as I mostly feel pain.  I use a mixture of things to get by."

I could never kill myself because life is binary, 1 is better than 0.  You don't have a lovely sleep, you go back to before birth, do you remember how nice that was? No me neither.
All else fails just pick up a drug habit, I cope with sugar codeine weed alcohol tobacco memes games and porn, not all at once though.

But I cannot reconcile with her, she has done and said too much and won't ever change.
My moment similar to yours was when on my wedding evening my mum and dad stormed out of our venue insulting all my wife's side of the family, saying they had stolen me and they are all gangsters. (not that I have my own free will god gave me and she pushed me away) 
My wife's parents said to me a few times just to give it a try (as it's our wedding and you'd expect people to behave) but after seeing what she was like that day/night they understood no contact was for the best."

Most recently when my wife and I went round, complained all meal about how it was cold then when I couldn't eat the ridiculous portion she gave (she knows I'm not a big eater) asked twice ""have you finished?"" in that tone that translates to ""surely you haven't finished, there's still loads on your plate""

Anything they can make you feel bad or guilty for they will.

She had the family cat put down and only told me 4 days afterwards and expected me to be fine with it when I saw the cat a week earlier (the cat was fine imo) when they went away and left the cat for a week on its own with nobody to go in and clean the litter box or replace the wet food.  It was my fault, and I was just looking for arguments and causing trouble when I expressed my feelings about the matter.

They always will make you feel guilt and shame, it's their bread and butter. I'm going NC with my parents and flying monkey brother, need to detox from them.

If they don't enhance your like, just like a gf or bf, why are you still in contact?

After the wedding that sense of obligation took a major hit, I'm just feeling it creep up now.
I'm starting to practise stoicism, and the main thing being don't worry about things that are out of one's control. I can control my Mother, my codependant Father or my flying monkey younger brother.  I feel so sad that they're all caught up in this mess, but at the same time so grateful I am finally free.
