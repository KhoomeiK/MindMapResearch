PhysicalEducation,fip6si5,t3_f870l6,1582599284.0,"I’ll play devil’s advocate here. If you have a strong curricular model, say Sport Ed. Gameplay and competition can be a good thing. Small-sided modified games. Guided to independent “team” practice. Team Based approach to instruction. Recorded results that are tracked and displayed (gamification). Team based roles (coaches, managers, statisticians, journalists). “Duty Teams” who learn to officiate play. Can be a highly engaging concept. 

You can work fitness into a “conditioning” coach role, where you can have your cake and eat it too. If the team earns “points” for quality effort during fitness, this seems to be a social motivator for students as well. Focusing too much on fitness can lead to avoidance as well. A well-balanced approach, with attempts to differentiate instruction, creative engagement strategies, and an attempt at reaching all students goes a long way.

Thirdly, you can work in cardio kickboxing, weights, cooperative games, non-traditional games into the Sport Ed. Model as well. But I do agree that narrowly schemed team sport only programs seem to be the default in America. Looking at the UK, Australia, Ireland, Spain, Brazil is fascinating in comparison. Both in difference and similarities."

teaching,es323f1,t3_c5kqxw,1561551008.0,"As a K-12 teacher the same age as you, I wouldn’t do it. Especially if they JUST graduated. Maybe if you met with a few students and even another teacher you all got along with might ease the sketchiness of a 1 on 1 meeting. It only takes one rumor to put you in hot water with admin and no teacher wants the stress of being investigated by licensure governing bodies. 

Think of if this student innocently mentions this to parents or a younger student that you may have next year. But at the end of the day, only you know your situation/community. I tend to err on the side of paranoid caution because I have heard some licensure horror stories over less.

PS: I have had to politely and respectfully decline so many birthday party invitations from my elementary (K-5) students 😂."

ketogains,eooanz8,t1_eoo9pmk,1558733906.0,"Thanks so much for the back and forth. It’s made me step back and really think about why I want to do what I’m doing. You mentioned this as a time of healing and I am already feeling that in regards to mental tension, joints, and skin. I need to let the A-type mentality go and just live in the moment, like you said we all know what is best for our body. Stripping the dogma of “you have to eat” is such a burden lifted, that it made me reevaluate my own dogma “I have to work out” for x, y, and z reasons. I think this whole process is going to let me have a healthier relationship with exercise as well as food.

Also, the throat hunger, honey, and salt tips are very important tips. I read about that previously so was prepared, but it’s awesome to know you had my back :) ."

I’m just kind of skinny fat and went on keto, liked what was happening, but read up on a lot of the health benefits of water fasting. So I’m doing a 7 day water fast to see what that feels like. I also read a book about meditation and feel like it’s helping in that regard as well. I’m not trying to get shredded or anything, I just have some smallish love-handles and lower belly fat that I haven’t been able to touch with IF (pre-keto) and some pretty intense exercise."
