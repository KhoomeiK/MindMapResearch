You may have never had the urge to post self love pictures because you may find it vain or attention seeking, but for others it can mean something totally different.






 For me, it's almost an act of rebellion, I'm not traditionally attractive and i fully expect to get hate and nasty comments a fair portion of the time, and when i take a picture that's super fire and I'm mega proud, I'm showing my self love and validation by saying ""fuck you"" to all the people who would try and shame me into hiding my self, being that brave ballsy kind of person i wish i was when i was younger. I certainly don't go around writing captions like that, but I'm sure some things I've posted have come across as attention seeking like you've described, even though that's not what i intended in the least.

Like, i get it, it's frustrating and unfair feeling when others just get handed things or positions or successes without having had to work hard for it, but that mindset isn't an excuse to label resources for differently abled, or just people period as some sort of bad thing. 



Also on the spectrum here, and if it weren't for resources that are *specifically* available for disabled people, I'd have no work history and I'd be living at home with my abusive family, and im closer to 30 than not now. I've worked my ass off, cried and bled and pushed my self to collapse and hospitalization to try and cope and work, and honestly? I wish no one had to go through what i have, just to reach a bare minimum necessary for survival. I'd be happy as a clam if **everyone** had the ability of assured employment, assured health care, and assured housing, without practically having to push their bodies into developing a disability to make it happen, and the more resources that are created for specific barriers the better!




 One or even a few autistic people getting a specific job because of their disability does not decrease your ability to gain employment or work hard to better your self and your future. If anything it normalizes the various quirks of this disability in the work place, *increasing* your ability to more gainful employment!

They're usually good with accommodating wheelchair/cane/brace/medical device users, but there's a lot of variable disabilities, some of them on the cognitive/sensory side, and it's not always considered, or even realistic to consider for those systems to accommodate them, so a smaller private transportation becomes necessary. And it's not even all cases, and all situations, but there are enough that removing that huge of an area of car access may prove more than just inconvenient for a larger group of people than you or many others might think. Without a robust and varied optioned system of public transit first put into place, and an affordable or realistic systems for smaller capacity transit also implemented, a move like what they're talking about may cause a lot of struggle and problems for some vulnerable members of their community."

 I'm doing what i can, will do what i need, but beyond that im out of ideas and hope. Unless by some miracle Bernie can snag that nomination before it all wraps up and the presidential ticket goes out, i just don't know.

I can try all i like, i have no ability to convince those people i know to change their minds, and honestly i don't blame them all that much.



 I have zero hope that Biden could take Trump, and even with everything at risk it won't be enough to change the minds of people disenfranchised by this country and these last four years especially. It would take a miracle, and I'm plum out of hope for that occuring any time soon.

At barely 30 pounds overweight i had my parents try and traumatize me into losing weight, making me believe i was as bad off and in as much danger as someone who weighs 400+ pounds, and for years before i ever got severely obese i thought i was already so fat it was too late, I'd have to resign my self to my mom shooting me in the face with a shotgun because i was too fat a couldn't change it. 



Didn't help that at 12-14 when this happened and i was threatened with literal death for being fat by my own mother, that i was on a high dose of *multiple* psychiatric medications that had a well known track record for causing life long side effects as well as massive weight gain, so when i ballooned up from chubby to full on fat in a summer my parents felt justified in over reacting. Because they'd rather dope me up with life altering medications than get me help from what I've now discovered was severe C-PTSD from their abuse. 



Now at 26 i get the joy of putting myself through hell trying to undo the side effects of years of systemic abuse and neglect, that started externally but i took internal and continued the abuse in a self flagellating way for a few years after i became an adult, because I honestly believed i deserved it.....

I was homeless in Oregon, in the valley specifically, so both the mold and pests were always having a hay day, and I'd get to worst, grossest rashes from the mold and mildew when I'd have to sleep in garages, but what really traumatized me were the vermin. I woke up one night with several rats crawling on top of me and my sleeping bag, and I've lost count the number of times i woke up with spiders and beetles and snails and god knows what else on or in my clothes. The stink bugs were the worst, I don't even wanna get into where I've found those.... When the raccoon was poking around inside the garage i just didn't sleep that night, the ones around there were very aggressive. I even called the cops once because it sounded like someone broke into the garage, but it was just an opossum.


I'd love to be able to say I've made a turn around and have gotten everything together, but honestly I'm just extraordinarily lucky for the people in my life who've helped me, believed in me, and help support me while i cannot. If it weren't for that i might still be sleeping in a garage, struggling to get it together while my health insurance systematically denies me care for the thing i **need** medical care for, to be able to sit or stand without excruciating pain that debilitates me, to the point i have to crawl on my hands and knees to even go potty, and sometimes can't make it.....

I won't give up, i refuse to, but how i wish that my country was more invested in the health of it's people.

ABoringDystopia,fmbndg7,t1_fmbm6mk,1585929714.0,"That's the thing, a ton of these companies **do** operate on tax payer funding. Many medications discovered and made in the US that come out were at least partially funded with tax payer money, if I'm not mistaken some are almost entirely funded with that tax money,  yet prices are still set at profiteering values, while virtually the rest of the world pays their actual value. There's no good reason that Americans should have to pay exorbitant prices, and die because they can't afford a life necessary medication, when someone in Canada or in the EU pays a tenth of that and to some extent has that care garaunteed by their government. 




I'm all for a company pulling a profit on a product they invested in, but when it literally costs human lives for absolutely no reason other than unadulterated greed? Something seriously needs to change, and a lot of people need to face the music and pay for recklessly causing deaths by their decision to price gouge citizens of one country, but virtually no others, when the money from those citizens helped create the drug in the first place!

 Maybe not as much when there's a huge shortage and health care workers and essential workers should have access first, but assuming there was the supply to support such a demand as everyone wearing masks in public, it would absolutely be a worth while step, with varying degrees of helpfulness dependant on what percentage of people actually wore them all the time in public spaces.


 Wouldn't completely solve the issue, but it would go a long way towards helping, and anything to flatten the curve at this point is desperately needed in all too many places.

Some doctors are super gung ho with medications, they want to attack the clinical and chemical cause of issues and really arent big on the kind of studies that explore non medication methods of treatment, or may even be receiving financial incentives for prescribing certain medications, depending on when and where you received treatment anyways.


 

I had this one prescriber who was part of my therapist's office, who would almost exclusively give out the medications that she had swag for: posters, mugs, a scale, stationary, and the like. I was on Seroquel for six years, from 12 years old to 18, *on top* of being on another anti psychotic for *sleep*. Nearly a decade later and im still suffering from those medications, and will have permanent joint damage from the nearly 200 pounds it made me balloon up. I didn't stop gaining weight until years after i stopped taking those pills, and i still struggle greatly with getting any of it to come off, even with intermittent fasting and limiting my calories to 1000-1500, a full minimum of 300 calories *less* than a medical nutritionist recommended to me to lose 2 pounds a week. 



I seriously hope you can recover from Seroquel easier and faster than i have, that drug is hell on your body and mind, i do not understand why they hand it out to candy to people who don't need something even half as strong, they need a real support system of competent professionals who provide the necessary mental health care to help the patient with the long term treatment, coping, and management of the source of what's causing their issues."
