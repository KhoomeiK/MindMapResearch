In the current version of the game meteors cannot break through the 'top' of the world, or even the rock layer above the last abyssalite layer going up. 

That top layer though will heat up to ~300C from whatever starting temp it is (i don't remember) so if you don't want to deal with a bunch of stuff at those temps you can still rush it (though all meteors spawn 300C material so you kind of have to deal with it regardless either way)"

1.So chlorine... it is by far the most insulating easily accessible gas (extremely low tc). This means it will pull heat away from your turbines very very poorly. It's clearly working bc no overheat but the gas just plain bad at taking up the heat from the turbine. 

2.Either actively cool (Aquatuner) OR passively cool (radiant piped turbine output), don't do both. If you do both the net result is cooling the turbine output water just to be reheated in the steam room, which is a waste of aquatuner power and hurts both your power and heat efficiency majorly (because they're tied together in this case). Interesting note, having a Cl atmosphere in the room mitigates this issue, probably almost entirely. I'd be interested in the temps of the top tiles vs the bottom tiles of Cl in the turbine room

3.If you're comfortable designing a high efficiency boiler/heat exchange, it can be run off a single minor volcano, so you def don't need 2 full volcanos if you don't want to. Mine took minor volcano 2 eruptions (not activity cycles) to get up to and maintain temp completely through idle/dormancy and now it's working. Granted this boiler has a >>95% efficient heat exchange, haven't done the math properly since it hit steady state after the most recent modifications and it's good, but requires aluminum to not be bonkers huge."

There would be no comparing fleet diplomatic power to total to see how far they went into military or such, it'd be right there at a glance. (I do not like the idea of RNG error added at this point)

Stellaris as it stands is very much a pure strategy game in the likeness of Chess, as you said. However, through it's presentation (governments, statecraft, trade, economics, fog of war) it also masquerades as an information game like starcraft and crusader kings (not dure about this one). 

To me it would be a better game if it leaned into that information control aspect more, with more ways to control information flow. More envoy mechanics and information control policies centered around ethics and such. Maybe even added nation project type things (midgame ""megastructure"" stuff), some of which could help control information and 'scouting' or buff diplomatic influence, or others that just give a slight midgame power spike in specific directions, when pops is really the hard limiting aspect of your econ.

Right now the only ways to get more or less information is to... get better sensor range then build a sentry array at the end, and maaaybe try to play around a nebula if you get luck with positioning. There is no other information control. I would want more policies around that and national project type stuff to allow for specialization and differentiation of empires prior to the point in endgame where you just start to be able to do everything, but that's my dream and not really relevant to the discussion at hand.

I would love an entire information control mechanic to be added in. Obscuring base level information would have to come hand in hand with mechanics to reveal and hide information, which imo would be absolutely fantastic. It also would ties nicely into the new diplomacy systems and new information we're now given. Pull some of that info back, made good relations provide more info, allow envoys to provide info regardless of relations. Allow policy to dictate how much info foreign envoys can glean and have it alter trust gain. Have galactic council influence related to this too.

Brood war (the original's expansion) is the competitive platform that is played still, but it's ungodly complex (2 decades of meta to digest in vs) and the control systems are insanely clunky, thought that is where a significant amount of the expertise happens. 

I would recommend downloading the free SC2 verses client, playing some AI games to get familiar with the units/buildings (i think you can play vs ai for free), then look into learning a couple builds of your preferred race and just try to follow them. It'll put you in the Legacy of the Void lobbies, which is the most recent of the 3 SC2 expansions, and the one that is still being played. There is no reason to buy the other 2 games unless you want the campaigns.

Somewhere in there after you've learned some of the basics, dodge over to sc2links.com and pick up a recent tournament. GSL - Super tournament 1 that just happened for example, or IEM - katowice was really good, or Homestory cup if a more free-form banter style of casting sounds interesting. But the casters in HSC will not help you along understand things so much, but be generally more entertaining, especially between matches. See if you can try to follow what's happening with your verses knowledge.

If you feel you still want to get into Broodwar at this point, watch some of the broodwar tournaments on sc2links. Tasteless/Artosis are the only ones casting broodwar in english I know of, but they're good about trying to introduce background needed to understand what's going on. If you still want to get it, look into the control limitations (can only select 12 things, nightmare pathing, cannot hotkey buildings, etc), and then if you still want to try it, buy it. Otherwise just keep watching it. I used to play that game so much but I just enjoy watching so much more now because I cannot handle the control schemes.

For SC2, I would really recommend catching games with Zombiegrub (doesn't do Tournies as often but is in IEM), Tasteless/Artosis, or Maynard casting as a beginner, as I find them easiest to follow, though ToD, feardragon, Grubby, and Maynard are all very good as well imo. By personal preference I don't like PiG as much, but he's getting better, but that's largely because I don't think he's as knowledgeable about Zerg as I would expect from a Zerg main and has some casting tendencies I don't like (seemingly purposefully calling who will win fights wrong?).

They still try to equalize their temp with the 3x3 tile area around them, defeating the purpose of insulating. They just slow down that process of equilibration of the tempshift with everything else compared to any other material, which is counter to the use case of a tempshift plate.

For most use cases of a tempshift you want high TC and low SHC, like a heat deletion steam room. However if you want to add thermal mass to an area, you want as high SHC as possible while not having too low TC. 

Clay, ice, and dirt are v good choices for this, though you have to watch the temperature range you're working in. (iirc you can make tempshifts from clay?) Ceramic isn't too good because it's shc is so much lower, much like granite and sandstone which i used to like. Plastic is decent, but the low conductivity can be harder to work with, i'd just use granite in that scenario. 

No tempshift plate is going to reduce temperature transfer from one area to another, at best (for that purpose) they're only add thermal mass so the gradient can be larger per tile if positioned properly and make active cooling easier with smaller temperature swings.

Keep in mind to keep the tempshift plates away from where they can pull heat directly out of the gas/room you want a thermal buffer from (so you don't want them right under that door like you have them for this purpose.) Also keep in mind tempshift plates set their starting temp at 40C so you can actually be raising the temp of the area when you first build them without active cooling."

Oxygennotincluded,fjen8e5,t3_fc3o7o,1583274814.0,"You might be running into a couple of bugs. High pressure steam has a tendency to delete a ton of heat. Don't remember the exact mechanisms of this but low pressure steam or putting your ST output vent to vent in in a small bit of oil/petrol solves this. 

There's also another water deletion bug I've run into when venting from high up and having the water fall. Mostly I've run into it when cooling larger sour gas areas by just dumping in water through tempshift or bottle emptiers, and then trying to vent the ST water pretty high up in the chamber through sour gas. Somehow this ended up deleting several hundred thousand kilos of water/steam over like 20 cycles. It also gets fixed by placing the ST output vent in a little puddle of petrol."

UBC,fiio9fv,t3_f80wwk,1582423874.0,"My way of getting through that was to desk job it. My 'vices' are primarily reading and video games. They're my go to avoidance things that don't progress anything or maintain my self (much).

By 'desk jobbing' school I set a rule that from when I left for school (8-9am) until 6pm weekdays I would not play games or read. Socializing, cooking, cleaning, etc is all fine, but no games or books.

Saturday was an off day _always._ midterms on Monday? Don't care Saturday is off. Sundays are maintenance (cook for the week, laundry, etc) and schoolwork I want to get ahead on, or was unable to finish the previous week.

I held this for Fridays too. Monday to Friday I didn't get off until 6pm. Really helped me figure out the work life balance and give myself enough not school time to stay healthy in my head while getting everything done. 

For exams, midterms, and end of term project time I sometimes would shit my schedule back to 8pm instead of six. Doing some overtime, but it's extremely important to maintain a 'work time' and a 'recovery time' that are distinct and do not bleed over into each other, hence Saturdays off."
