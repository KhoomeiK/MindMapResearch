It started with me getting triggered about some stuf that happened exactly 1 year ago,I had been fighting off feeling or thinking about it as much as possible all quarantine but it didnt always work and I fell into some depressive states last month. 

But then about a week ago different things started happening, more flashbacks about the instance and experience and emotional flashbacks..

Then the nausea which I wasn't sure was related at first but now I'm sure is..

Then the waking up suddenly in a panic, lack of sleep.

Its alarming and keeps getting worse.

Today all of the above continued to happened and I was shaky and I feel rattled, and my throat started to feel swollen and just like it's hard to breathe. Weirdly it feels better if I lightly squeeze it and put some pressure on it ? I dont know if maybe the heightened cortisol is just causing my arteries to  feel swollen and that's why that's happening/helping? But its weird. It's something my mother has described to me and attributed to her PTSD, but I never personally experienced.

I've noticed for me when it's scary to talk about it to people sometimes I can make a short insta story post or something about something and then that helps..and sometimes people message me about things. 

I don't go into details but saying I overcame abuse, or medical trauma, or domestic violence and usually in a way that's framed around raising awareness (although sometimes it's just about me)..it helps. And I get a few messages of support, especially when I'm ""coming out""

Sometimes it's easier than telling people face to face becuase this stuff eats away at you but it never feels like an appropriate time to discuss and can be hard to if you're at gatherings or in public...so doing this and letting the people who want to support me come forward, has been a way. And I've spoken about it with very close people to me before I started doing that.

And when people see that and then start framing you in their mind as a survivor, without you having to directly speak about details with them; it can be helpful. And then if you want to discuss things later you know they kinda know already and have warmed up to the idea so you can...

For me what it was was another violent episode that just triggered all the other ones and like a loop I just realized how many times he had lost his temper and gotten physically with me over the years. He never punched me or anything but would frequently destroy and throw objects, corner me, scream in me, restrain me, grab me,shake me, throw me around.. 

What helped lift the veil though was I looked at an argument we were having, the last one where he put his hands on me..through the perspective of a child. I thought how would I feel or what would I be doing this if we had a baby sleeping in the other room right now and like a 4 year old little girl or boy watching him treat me like this. And I realized in that context, this was domestic violence I was experiencing. It took putting me in a family perspective instead of just two ""young people"" in a relationship to realize. 

And once I saw the relationship for what it was I knew I HAD to get out. I couldn't tolerate it. And I couldnt risk being with a man I'd feel so unsafe around for myself and also for my future family."

I think I made a thread about it once lol.

 When I had told him he had started doing the kinky stuff in his sleep he was really freaked out and told me not to like go along with it like I normally did but honestly there wasnt much I could do. If he did it too long or hard and I felt like he wasn't aware or in control I would just sort of tug at his hand and throw him off the way you would if someone was holding you in your sleep and you wanted off, that usually worked. But sometimes he would just become more aggressive in his sleep.

 We also didnt use protection and he pulled out which is another reason he started to dislike sleep sex cause I'd generally let it go until we were having sex. He always woke up at some point during the sex though lol. 

I usually was up much later than him and didnt fall asleep right away so I never really woke up to it I was usually just laying there and then he'd start. There were a few times I was asleep too.
