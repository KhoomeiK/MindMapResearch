learnspanish,fq6362u,t3_ggt4lt,1589123533.0,"It depends entirely on YOUR level of commitment. I studied in my home country's university in classes and I always did pretty well on paper, but when I actually got to Spain (studied abroad + lived there for two years teaching) was when I was really put to the test. Basically, I have friends who lived in Spain longer than I have and I am, frankly, better than they are. I'm not smarter, I just tried REALLY hard to learn as much as I could and I went out of my way to interact and practice. Once you actually move to Spain and are surrounded by the language you will have an easier time, but it takes more than just osmosis. If you only ever hang out with English speakers and watch everything in English, you'll never improve. These are my tips:

  
\-consume the media!!! read the newspaper, watch shows, listen to music, check out magazines. It will definitely help you adjust to a new country if you know what's going on there and the likely phrases they use. I find that tv shows from Spain can be VERY different (in humour, context, references), but thankfully everything is dubbed in Spain, so I found it helpful to watch shows like Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother since I was familiar with them. When you're first starting out, watch them with English subs, then try later to watch them in Spanish with Spanish subs (if you miss a word you can at least also read it, very helpful)

In my opinion it's helpful to consume the media of the place you'll actually be (i.e. Spain vs Colombia) because the Spanish in Spain is very distinctive. I started out with Latin American Spanish and finished with Spain Spanish, but it meant that while living there I was in an awkward transition between saying ""computadora"" and ""celular"" to ""ordenador"" and ""móvil."" If you already have a base of SPAIN Spanish when you arrive, it will be so much easier. Not sure what kinds of shows you're into but some notable shows from Spain (on Netflix) are: Elite (rich kids murder mystery, similar to Pretty Little Liars/Riverdale but in my opinion much more well done and less campy), La Casa de Papel (listed as Money Heist on english netflixes, very intriguing heist drama), Merli (difficult to find on non-Spanish netflix but if you can, it's actually a catalan show but the dubbed version in Spanish is great and it's about a teacher and his students in the last years of high school).

\-get out of your comfort zone. It's great that you'll have your boyfriend with you, but since i'm guessing he also speaks English, he will always be able to translate for you or will slow down his Spanish. People in general won't always do that and a lot of people in Spain can't speak a word of English (mostly older generations). Talk to them! Go to the store yourself, order in a restaurant, browse the shops in Zara and ask if they have your size, go on a free walking tour (if you're in a touristy area) in Spanish and see what you can pick up. Consider enrolling in a class (in person or online) in your home country before you go so that you'll have a good base when you arrive.

These are fairly common tips but they actually do work. There was such a huge difference between people I knew who only ever hung out with other exchange students vs people who attempted to join student convo partner groups in Spanish, people who went out alone, people who took the time to study and try to read the menu in Spanish instead of asking for an English one. Spanish people also love to practice their English, so you could probably find a local exchange partner very easily, where you talk English with them for half an hour then they talk Spanish with you.

BTW, I just want to throw this out there... i've studied Spanish on and off since 2013. I lived there entirely for two years, and I'm currently studying to write the C1 exam sometime in the fall or winter. And still, I would not be comfortable studying in a completely Spanish university. This would be very, very difficult (and most require a proficiency exam before admitting you) unless you had the time to study like a diplomat, like one of the other comments suggested. Is there a reason you feel this is your only way in? How old are you? Have you thought about teaching or au-pairing? Also, depending on where your bf lives, some unis have programs completely in English. Feel free to PM me with any questions as I've done it all! Buena suerte."
AskReddit,fq29r04,t3_gge8dn,1589054113.0,"A LOT of people died when I was in high school. For a small town (less than 15k) and only one high school, we saw a lot of tragedies. Several car accident deaths and a couple of unfortunate suicides. The worst one though was a very tragic death of a boy who was at a party and passed out in the back of a van. The van was then stolen and driven out to a country area. I believe the consistent story is that the thieves feared being caught and abandoned their plans by torching the van, with the boy inside. It was one of those windowless white vans so they never even knew he was there (I hope). There were missing posters for him around town for several days before the mystery unfolded. It was very sad."

All of a sudden I was confusing the kids I taught and had to start saying ""ordenador"" and ""móvil.""

languagelearning,fpcyjrp,t3_gcnryw,1588515913.0,"I'm a B2 in Spanish going for my C1. Ive been studying with a professional Spanish teacher since September, specifically in preparation for the exam, and it's killing me! I used to live in Spain and I had zero trouble navigating everything from the shop to the bus station to my phone contract to my housing contract, and even the dreaded bureaucracy of getting my temporary residency card (I was an auxiliar de conversación). I'm sadly back home in Canada and without that daily practice I feel even more lost, coupled with the fact that because I learned my Spanish mostly from daily life and conversations, I have SO MANY GAPS, and lots of fossilized errors due to no one really correcting me because my Spanish was otherwise good enough. I've been doing mock exams and there will be times I absolutely ace one section, then have another where I missed one key concept and it threw off the entire thing. It's very frustrating because I feel like I've been B2 for years. I know I improve every day, it's just a lot harder to see.


I do have the advantage of 1. Having lived in Spain, so I was able to buy books in the language and read at any level, and 2. Studying Spanish itself, a VERY popular language with tonnes of content available in the form of books, podcasts (even for advanced, like TED Talks in Spanish), TV shows, music, etc. I've started listening to podcasts apart from my regular Spanish homework and taking down words I don't know. I like it and the podcasts are interesting. I hope to write my C1 in the Fall or early 2021."

There were a lot of things I liked and didn't like about this season, most are already here but not this.... I didn't quite understand this from Cayetana .. maybe an insignificant detail but it bothered me (spoiler obviously):

\*  
\*  
\*  
Why did Caye run some of the Twitter hate accounts? If she was just using Polo to get money to go to school in London, why would she anonymously post hate about him when she knew it was driving him to attempt suicide? Surely she didn't think that his mums would give a shit about her if he suddenly died? They'd be devastated... I suppose in the end they did offer her some money and she turned it down but it didn't make sense to me that she would run an account and risk ruining that chance.

Likes this season:   
\-Guzman's arc of revenge-turned-bigger person. Probably the best character development of the entire series  
\-Lu staying single and ending up friendly with Nadia, which I always figured might happen  
\-Rebeca, she's just a great character and I'm glad in the end she wanted to just live a normal life  
\-Samu and Guzman's friendship

Dislikes:  
\-the two new characters... I actually think it would have been more interesting if Malick DID want to get to know Nadia and she had to choose between her future in NYC with him and the one she truly loved (Guzman). Yeray was just boring, I didn't dislike him as a person but he was super one-dimensional and I don't like Carla at all so I hated scenes of them together. Also, why would he give a shit about investing in her father's company after everything that happened? He didn't owe her anything, he should have ripped that contract up and said Adios.  
\-Samu's CONSTANT rage and need for vengeance when he was probably one of the least affected by what Polo did when you consider how new he was to Las Encinas and how little he truly knew Marina. Also, him and Carla is an absolute crack ship. I can't believe they ever ended up together in season 2 in the first place and she was right not to get back with him in the end  
\- the cancer storyline with Ander.... why is it always the queer character who has to go through something grave? And Omar, who was so in love with him for two whole seasons, suddenly can't wrap his head around the illness and cheats on him with his SISTER'S supposed boyfriend? It felt way too OOC for me  
\-I know they're probably never coming back because of La Casa de Papel but I started watching this show for Jaime Lorente (Nano) and I miss him, Samu is the most boring main character replacement ever. And Christian added a lot of fun, I feel like they tried to replace him with Valerio who I like, but Christian being from the poor side of the tracks made him feel more genuine.

Sizeable Hispanic community (Colombians and Salvadoreños mostly), nice burby feel in some parts of Waterloo, they're kind of trying to make uptown Waterloo a yuppie area. It's fairly safe and not huge like Toronto but still big enough to not be bored, and close enough to Toronto for weekend trips. Winters suck though, it's cold for like 7 months straight but if you like the snow then you'll like it! Now that the light rail transit is done traffic is a bit better but much to be desired."
TEFL,f906mf0,t3_e30b38,1574968681.0,"I taught adults in Spain with private lessons. A lot of actual adults (30+) don't speak any English and never learned. There was a shift in Spain that went from French being the second language learned in school, to English. I forget when, but most of my 40+ colleagues remember it that way. Many parents can't help their kids with their English homework. The adults I did teach, who sought lessons with me for their own private learning, mostly did it for their career. Spain's economy is getting better, but there is still a lot of competition for jobs and being competent in English can be important for many of the positions. I taught a French woman in her 40s who already spoke Spanish, French, and Portuguese, but her work required her to speak English as many of their clients did. I also taught high schoolers, and many of those going into uni have at least a basic English competence as it's part of their uni entrance exam, regardless of program. My two roommates in their 20s spoke excellent English, and they were doctors in public hospitals, so it seemed they learned it for their profession. I'd say the general attitude of adults in Spain towards learning English is that it's unnecessary if they already don't (they feel it's too late) but those who seek lessons or additional practice are very serious about it and like it. I am not Spanish but I lived and worked there for three years. 
Also, a special Ed teacher I worked with who spoke no English told me that nowadays, he would not have been able to get the same job (he is like 42) because requirements are changing for teachers to have at least a b1 or so in English even if they don't teach English at all. This was in Castilla La Mancha Catholic school board."

I'm about to shop for my meal prepping and my go to has always been rice and chicken with tonnes of veg. Thanks!! Shopping in Ontario Canada if that helps for brands/foods.
Also, do you recommend buying a scale? Thanks!"

Wrap it? Get on bc? Get off each other for one second? I know some people are against abortion but there are soooo many ways to be safe before that. Four kids is not a whoops, that's just plain negligence. Now of course they both work hard AF and have to deal with 4 wild ass kids. But hey, ""God's will."" Such bullshit."

When we're two years into a relationship and love each other and you still don't believe me about not wanting any kids? I put ""no dads"" in my Tinder bio and I got so many weird bingo comments on it from guys I matched with. I'd rather just be alone than waste my time with someone who wants or already has kids. My biggest fear is to date someone who pretends to be okay with CF but is really just waiting for me to change... Ugh."

We grew up in a shitty apartment, no money, no college funds, no luxuries. Not that luxuries = a good life, but it's awful being a kid growing up poor next to classmates who have all the latest and got to go on Disney vacations and live in big houses. I'm in my lste 20s now and my parents have never changed their habits, remaining poor. I'm trying but struggling under student loans and a ceiling I can't break through (want to study a masters to move up, have no money). I cant help but feel resentful that my parents had TWO kids when they were living in a dismal financial state already and now I have to watch others with much easier lives because their parents had the good sense to, ya know, think about the reality/cost of kids...."

PersonalFinanceCanada,f1zilrv,t1_f1yytao,1569844201.0,Yeah it's usually premade lesson plans and you just go through them with the kids. Sometimes there are songs. Kids on Palfish anyways are like 4-12. It's pretty easy but you have to be very expressive and goofy and like kids haha
PersonalFinanceCanada,f1y8ilx,t3_db2ysv,1569811578.0,"If you have a bachelors degree and dont mind kids, online teaching is an excellent gig. Places like dada abc, vipkid, palfish, etc and the hours are based on beijing time so you can do some classes on weekends or before work if you're 9-5 in ontario. Pm me and i can send you a palfish referral if youre interested (my fave one , set your own schedule and the 16 usd per hour becomes nearly 21 cad)
Edit: anyone I've pm'd, you may need a TEFL certification, but i got one for $19 on groupon with open academy. They will accept ANY. Also some people say bachelor isnt needed right now?? Check it out anyways! Sorry, i forgot that but it's so easy to get. I did mine in like 3 hrs"

TEFL,f1e3vmd,t3_d8jplf,1569411882.0,"It depends on what you're used to with BEDA tbh. I did 24hours so I had the highest pay, but I also lived in a smaller city so my money (1135) went sooooo far. Ministry hourly is technically better, but you're only working 12 hours. 700 euros will not go far in most places. If you're lucky enough to be in Madrid, ministry will pay you 1000 for 16 hours.... And BEDA, anywhere from 873-1135 depending on your hours assignment. I'd say it would only be worth switching to ministry if you were in Madrid. Otherwise you'll have to take on a lot of private classes with the 700/mo if you plan on having any fun! I was always jealous of my ministry friends' schedule, but I also realized if I worked it, I wouldn't have enough money to do what I wanted (travel) with all those long weekends anyways. That's just my opinion though, some people loooove ministry and if you already have savings it can be a chiller gig with way more location options."
CICO,exhqb80,t3_cq8svt,1566311616.0,"I understand this :( I'm 5ft tall and my TDEE for me to lose weight is practically the lowest it could be (1200). I also have a huge appetite and I used to eat close to that for just one meal! And a lot of my friends are taller and have way higher TDEEs :( It does feel restricting! What's helped me so far is to break up my meals/snacks throughout the day. I work 11-7 so I have a nice 250ish cal meal for breakfast, then snack throughout the day (a plum or granola bar every few hours etc) and then I make sure I have a larger dinner so I feel more satisfied and then don't usually eat any more after that. IF doesn't work for me due to my work schedule but I found when I ate the smaller snacks while saving a bigger dinner for later, I was less likely to binge hard like I used to at the end of the day. Good luck <3"
