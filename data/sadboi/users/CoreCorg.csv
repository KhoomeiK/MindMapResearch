Maybe you can help by identifying ways to help her when she's feeling bad, I know a really cold shower helps me stop disassociating and/or having a panic attack. Maybe there's something like that for her that you can help her figure out, and help remind her of when needed. 

Also, it's super important bipolar people take their meds, but I hear a common complaint on this sub is people getting annoyed when they're asked ""did you miss your meds?"" In a dismissive and/or accusatory tone every time they show any emotion. So just be cautious of that.

Try to always appreciate that while her emotions may be stronger than most people, they're still valid and shouldn't be dismissed just because she's bipolar. Ask her to explain why she's feeling a certain way if she wants to talk, and/or tell her it's okay if there's no real reason.

Take care of yourself and distance yourself from her if you need to, but try to be as understanding and forgiving as you can be. She's going to make mistakes and say hurtful things, everyone does but bipolar people do especially."

Well no, you're not a doctor, but your doctor is, lol. And it's your body. Getting good healthcare typically requires input from both a professional and the individual experiencing symptoms. Telling him you think it might be bipolar, but also giving a really genuine account of what's happening (don't let yourself phrase it in a way that makes it sound especially bipolar, just tell it as it is) seems to me like it'd lead to the most accurate diagnosis. It could help your doctor understand what you mean when you describe your symptoms, by prompting him to look at it through the perspective that seems most fitting in your eyes, while still giving him the objective descriptions needed to help prevent a misdiagnosis.

I can skip 1 - 4 nights of sleep in a row without feeling any significant fatigue (I'm far happier, alert, and better at focusing during these periods). I typically don't take any naps or use as many stimulants as I normally would (I have a prescription for adderall, and I love coffee and energy drinks) so it's pretty crazy that I still don't need sleep. Then I'll crash, sleep for around 10 - 12 hours, and wake up in the beginning stages of depression. I tried resisting the urge to embrace being awake during my last hypomanic episode, because I didn't want to invoke depression, but when I tried to sleep I was unbelievably fidgety/shakey/anxious/scared and didn't get any sleep anyway.

relationships,fovj1yk,t1_fosq8s0,1588102154.0,"Hmmmm. I'm not sure I've ever had to put it into words. I'm no professional psychologist, but I'll try my best to describe my personal thoughts on it. *This got lengthy, I found it cathartic to talk about it, and I can't blame you for not caring to read it.* I truly really appreciate that you sound like you're open minded about it, I took your initial comment to be more dismissive than maybe you meant. Hopefully OP finds his helpful, if they read this essay I accidentally wrote.

For starters you say that ""not caring about a particular thing is not laziness"". Totally agree, your gardening example is great for that. I think I'd call it lazy when you don't care to put the work into something that you *know is important objectively* until you get motivation that actually strikes you as personally worth the effort. Let's take washing the dishes. You might *know* it matters in general but not really care to put the work in. But if you somehow did start to personally care you could totally get up and go wash those dishes (like maybe your SO says if you don't wash them today they're leaving you, and that's enough to spark you into caring when you might not otherwise). But if you're lazy, it's likely you'll stop caring again once the immediate threat making it personal is gone. You'll choose something like video games over chores. The keys here are that you:

1. *know it's important*, but unless it strikes you as urgent/personal you don't bother to deal with it, you'd *rather just not*

2. You *can do it* once you decide it's worth the effort 

ADHD on the other hand, is such a weird and intensely aggravating problem. I'll desperately want to wash those dishes. There's nothing I'd rather do. I'm disgusted that they look/smell gross, they're attracting ants, my SO makes it an ultimatum. But I try to picture myself getting up and washing them, and while I know deep down that it's a simple task, I reach this mental block trying to think up how to do it. I might even start panicking and, at least personally, I won't really have a train of thoughts comprised of words about why it's impossible, but it'll just *feel overwhelming*, almost like a phobia or traumatic memory. And should I find the willpower to start the activity (which I swear is embarrassingly difficult when your mind is blank and your body is producing stress hormones or whatever it does) I might get lost a minute into it, I can't bring myself to keep at it long enough to finish it, even if it only takes a few minutes. It makes me feel stupid and worthless, and aggravates me to no end.

ADHD medicine (adderall, personally) totally fixes that ridiculous block that stops me from doing what I want (washing the dishes is a good example in some ways, but this even extends to things I enjoy, like wtf?! I'll want to play a video game or draw, but I truly *can't* for the same reasons as wish the dish washing description. I'll want to have fun but instead I panic and thoughtlessly stare at the wall for hours). But no amount of adderall will make me put down what I'd *rather do* (like video games) and wash those dishes, even when the dishes are repulsive and clearly need to be washed, if I don't feel it's personally worthwhile (which happens when I feel lazy). Lazy makes me choose to do things I want, not things that are more important. ADHD instead bulldozes my ability to direct my thoughts and willpower and stops me from doing something that I want desperately to do. 

I'm sorry this is an essay and rambling. But I hope it helps someone."

I think it can become permanent but that its sorta different in how it looks when that's the case? More spasms than general unsteadiness, I think. I'd ask your doctor for sure.

Edit: I think you would be best to stick it out till you see your doctor, i don't think it's likely to be permanent. But I understand the fear. My hand shaking only got worse when I upped my dosage, it didnt just get worse over time. And I never wanted to add a new medicine, but my doctor did say there are meds for this side effect. I have a friend on 15mg abilify who takes a medicine to stop shakiness and he says it helps a lot."
bipolar,fo3duc0,t3_g5hdm8,1587485207.0,"I have never felt an ounce of benefit from therapy, and I have gone into it very open minded many times. I think I've tried at least 5 different therapists / psychologists, each for at least a few months. No benefit. I only tried so hard because, like you said, everyone goes on about how great it is. I do believe therapy can help people, I've had friends (not bipolar) benefit a lot from it. But idk, maybe my problems are just so chemical that only psychiatrists really help? It just isn't for everyone I think."

bipolar,fnowe8u,t1_fnovrrm,1587134868.0,"Lmao, sorry but I have no interest in having any prolonged discussion about how laughably incorrect your first comment is. My profession is irrelevant, and it's not as if either of us is throwing up proof of professions anyway so for all I want I can claim I'm a psychiatrist. I'm not, but at least I'm not babbling nonsense and lying to someone asking for help by pretending to be a psychologist. I just wanted OP to know to at least question what you said, for example by doing a quick Google of ""is bipolar a personal disorder"" and seeing you're full of shit. Peace out."
bipolar,fnovcxd,t1_fnor152,1587134309.0,"Um...... First of all, hallucinations are VERY typical of bipolar people. Your comment is so disorderly that I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, but I specifically feel that describing this as a ""personal disorder"" makes no sense / incorrectly represents it. Do you mean personality disorder? Because it's not. It's a mood disorder. They're different. I seriously hope you're lying about being a psychologist...

Edit: it's cool that you cleaned up your previously incoherent comment to be readable, but it's still wrong to describe bipolar as a personality disorder free of hallucinations."

ACQR,fnmd8vg,t3_g2j655,1587069336.0,"Reminds me of nooksisland.com/designs

But I more the welcome a diversity of sites for this much needed feature! One thing I would recommend is customizable tags. Nooksisland only allows preset tags. I wanted to tag my designs with something like ""Zelda"" since it wasn't in their title, and I was sad the closest I could get was ""video game"". Similarly I wanted to search for phone cases but I just had to hope someone put ""phone"" or ""case"" in their design title. Just my experience with a similar website. I look forward to seeing both sites grow and provide the community with an awesome resource

Edit: remembered another thing I would love, so here's another suggestion lol: maybe create a spot on the site where people can post requests / design suggestions? Like some sort of forum I guess?"

relationships,fnm4tki,t3_g2gm2h,1587065106.0,"Agree with others, sounds like dissociation and it's pretty common in abusive situations. I highly, highly recommend getting out of there as quickly as possible. I grew up in an abusive household and found myself doing similar things to cope. Now I'm living a dream life (awesome job, good apartment, decent physical health, perfect boyfriend) and I find I sometimes can't stop dissociating during precious moments... granted, I'm bipolar and that's part of bipolar, but developing bipolar and coming from an abusive household are very related things. It sucks so much. So, basically, don't feel like a freak but get out of there before your brain forms this as a habit and/or develops a lifelong disorder.

Edit: I've felt so frustrated at my brain and guilty about these kinds of behaviors in my adult self. I understood it a lot better when my therapist said something like ""your brain is doing its best to help you out. It's doing what it has learned. Unfortunately, it did most of its learning while you were young, in highly stressful environments where having intense emotional reactions, or none at all, would be the appropriate response for keeping you safe. Unfortunately, your brain is sticking to this and making you dissociate during concerts, or cry from simple, harmless statements. But it really is your brain trying its best with what it has learned"" - please don't teach your brain that this is what life is like for any longer than necessary, get out of that situation asap. Best of luck."
BipolarReddit,fnld6cr,t1_fnlcaoh,1587051463.0,"Preach. I certainly would wish it away from myself, because it's tough af to deal with and I'm exhausted from a decade of battling mental illness. But I try not to feel like a worse person for having it. Like, I don't want it (although if I'm being honest I think it has helped me grow and has lead to some of my best memories and closest friendships, which is pretty cool haha) but I shouldn't feel lesser for having it. I hope we get that peace of mind, and that society turns around its opinion on us too <3"
bipolar,fnlcmk1,t1_fnlbfex,1587051176.0,"I second the sentiments in here! No one should feel pressured to disclose their diagnosis, but personally I feel so much better since doing so. 

I first decided to start talking about it for more altruistic reasons. I felt that not everyone had the comfort zone to open up about this and invite judgement, but that if the people in a stable position could be an example of bipolar people functioning well, this could help people who are in a rougher phase of the illness / less fortunate and stable period of life. I figured it'd help neurotypical people normalize the illness, and most importantly that maybe someone who is quietly suffering and ashamed of their own mental health diagnosis might feel support through my openness.

But it's become so much more personally beneficial than I expected. People around me don't crack hateful bipolar jokes, and I learned who I can depend upon when I have emotional flare ups. And I feel loved for who I am because I know the people who love me do so with full knowledge of my disorder. 

So I totally understand it might be best to not be open about it, no pressure. But I encourage you to think about if maybe it'd benefit you to be open about it, it has made me feel so much less ashamed.

Edit: by ""you"" I mean OP, and anyone else in their situation. Not you the commenter I'm replying to, which would make no sense lol"
