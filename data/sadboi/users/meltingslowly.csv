However there are a few things you can do to prepare. 

Read the book “I am not sick. I do not need help.” This gives you some techniques on how to structure your conversations and how to find common ground with your loved one. 

Find a nami.org support group in your area. The meetings are usually once a month, and there are special groups for those experiencing first episode psychosis. Get connected to others experiencing similar issues. It helps to know you are not alone. 

Make the effort to get him to appointments with his doctors. He will likely not do so on his own. 

Find help within your religious community if you have one. 

Get connected to any county resources that are available such as a county case worker. The more the people on your team the easier it will be to handle the next crisis. 

See if your brother will sign a release of information form. Without it, you will not get any useful information from his doctors and care providers. It is scary to be locked out of your loved ones’ care. 

Take care of yourself. This is a very lonely road you are on, so try to bring as many people who can support you along and stay positive. People have learned to deal with this disease, so don’t lose hope. He needs you now- so make sure you are there for him. Treat this as a serious illness even though you cannot see it in physical form. 

Give yourself time. Plan on this taking 6 mos. Treat it as a marathon not a sprint. Any recovery will follow its own timeline so be patient. Things will return to some form of normal.

If he has an assigned county case worker, then this would be a good time to engage them as well. 

See if there is a Nami.org meetup in your area and attend that to get plugged in with real humans who have similar problems. That’s the best way to get practical solutions. 

If you see any signs of danger... inability to take care of oneself, or risk of self harm or harm to others, then you can call 911 and ask for a crisis intervention team. These folks will take him to a hospital for evaluation where he will likely be admitted to a 72-hour hold. That would be the best possible outcome in this case. Especially if involuntary commitment is required by the hospital provider. 

The problem with high performers is that they know exactly how to mask their symptoms when being evaluated. So provide as much information as you can to the first responders. 

(note that if your 911 results in normal police being sent, then please make sure they know that they are dealing with someone who is mentally ill, so the situation does not escalate if he is non compliant.)

Part of growing up is learning that life does not owe you reasons. Things often happen just because the universe wills it so. 

You will get over this breakup and you will find someone who wants to be with you just as much as you want to be with them. 

In the meantime, don’t neglect yourself. 

Good luck!"

This is a difficult situation to be in at any age. I cannot imagine how hard it must be for you at 14. 

You should be very proud of yourself that you have recognized how serious this situation is, all by yourself, and that you are now taking steps to get help.  This is huge - as you will realize on your journey back to mental health. 

But realize that this is a serious illness. You would not treat yourself if you had cancer or heart disease, would you? Similarly you need to assemble your own team to get you out of this. 

So - go find that help. It may be your parents (i hope it is), a favorite teacher, the school nurse, an uncle or aunt, a grandparent, or a cousin. 

But do this right away. The longer you wait, the harder it will get for you to get back to where you want to be. 

Bless you for your strength, but know that things WILL get better. 

You have already taken the most important step - you are aware there is a problem. To beat it, you will need to get your people to support you. I sincerely hope you are able to do this as well.

The book “I am not sick. I do not need help” has ideas on reflective listening that help with non-compliance. 

As you already are probably aware this is going to be a long and lonely struggle - both for him and you. See if you can rope in other family or friends who may be vested in him. 

You are doing a good thing... stay strong.

first off, congratulations on setting up your appointment.

A psychologist will likely perform an assessment to confirm whether you are indeed an imminent danger to yourself. If so, it can lead to reporting you to the authorities to recommend hospitalization. Or, if the situation is not urgent, it might involve a referral to a psychiatrist to determine if medications might help. 

The psych should explain all of this to you at the start of the appointment. 

Sending you positive energies!"

It may seem unnecessary right now but I would strongly recommend that all of you get counseling on how to deal with a chronic condition - it will truly help you all pull together as a team.
