I could see how some think it’s cheating. Typically masturbation orgasms are achieved while watching porn so that opens the door to a set of problems. Personally my partner and I agree that because we are both sexually happy together, we don’t need porn nor do we think it will improve our relationship so porn itself is a no-go, but masturbation is fine. 
Talk with your SO, if you guys are having sex you should be mature enough to discuss these type of things with them. Relationships aren’t cookie cutter perfect. What works for some may not work for others."

If I were to lose access to my car, traveling by a bus would take me about 3.5 hours to get to work and maybe a bit more to get to school.

Sometimes, I can catch myself and be okay. I’ll just tell myself logical conclusions and work my way through the day the best I can and find an outlet for my anxiety and maybe take a depression nap.
