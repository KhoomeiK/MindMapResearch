March/April were the worst months especially April when I had my worst anxiety attack in two years. By late April, I exercised, meditated, and used my phone less and now feel better (not 100% but better)I recommend you stop reading about the news and just understand that things are far out of your control. Right now you got to look at this as a way of stepping back and working on yourself and learning new attributes so when this is over you’ll become a person than before. Oh and we don’t know if this is going to be all the way to 2022. Let the scientists and doctors do their work and don’t trust the news nor that bs propaganda about “all in this together” bs.
