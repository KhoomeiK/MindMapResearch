massachusetts,fr54wof,t1_fr4v1wa,1589902560.0,"So, there are people who take anxiety meds like SSRIs their entire lives. Sometimes therapy is not enough and there’s just a chemical imbalance in the brain that causes life-altering anxiety. If people stop these meds, and the anxiety that was there to begin with resurfaces, does that mean that the meds were not the best way to treat the anxiety? I’d argue that no, it doesn’t mean that. Sometimes anxiety never goes away permanently and the meds only work while you take them."

CoronavirusMa,fr1u7t6,t1_fr1svqb,1589826027.0,"Thank you! Personally, I’m worried because I live with my boyfriend who is a nurse working on an entirely covid-19 floor for now, meaning that we are both exposed. I work with group homes for adults with disabilities so it would be really risky for me to go in right now. I could get tested, but realistically, every day he comes home from work there’s a chance he could spread the virus to me. So unless I’m getting tested every day, which is unrealistic, the risk is still there and the population I work with is highly vulnerable. 

I know other people who have no one to watch their kids, or who live with an elderly or immunocompromised family member, or who have underlying health issues themselves, but a lot of employers seem to care more about a blanket reopening than working with employees on a case by case basis to figure out what’s safe, which I understood would also be putting a very difficult decision on people who may not be knowledgeable enough or have all the information necessary to make a proper protocol. 

Workers in these situations need protection."

So there’s a lot of factors that go into planning the logistics of these markets. Also a lot of vendors have been cash only, which comes with a transmission risk."

EliteNetflix,fqtkx59,t3_gkphyb,1589641008.0,"I come from a Muslim immigrant family so I have a Baba myself. It’s truly difficult. He sacrificed a lot by leaving his family behind to come to the US, but he did it for himself first, to have a better life that he really enjoys now. He’s strict to the point of being judgmental and intolerant. Back in high school when he found out I’m actually Christian, he called me an embarrassment to the family, threatened to disown me, and didn’t talk to me for months. He’s homophobic and he hates Jews. He says that on judgement day, Allah will raise all the people with tattoos and burn the tattoos off their skin while they feel everything. In middle school he told me I was going to get pregnant when I was just going to the movies with a group of friends. His top priority is how we are a reflection of him and that we make him look good to the rest of the family. 

So, when I see how Baba treats Omar and Nadia, my heart breaks because I know exactly how it feels. Growing up torn between the Western country you live in and the Muslim family you come from, you live your life in terms of shame and guilt. You’re forced to choose between your own happiness and your family, because your happiness does not make them happy if it goes against their traditional values. All my life I felt too ethnic for my peers, but too Western for my family. This kind of conditional love is the opposite of what you’re supposed to get from your parents. Are the other parents in the show perfect? Hell no, but that doesn’t excuse Omar and Nadia’s dad, either."
