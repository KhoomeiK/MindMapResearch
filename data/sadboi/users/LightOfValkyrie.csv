This is exactly how I've been feeling. Back in March I was convinced my loved ones and I would catch the virus and die. Now my fears on the virus are practically nonexistent. 

But now that's there more and more evidence coming out that the virus isn't as bad as we once thought (shoutout to the good news thread), pretty much all of my focus has shifted over to the lockdowns.
