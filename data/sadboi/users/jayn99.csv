I‚Äôve slept with a coworker before, after that our days were extremely awkward and unpleasant. It may seem like it‚Äôs worth it for a quick release, but remember that every single day that you see her after on, you will not forget about that interaction OR the rejection of the interaction.

Try live with a little bit of fantasy in your life ‚Äî or an ‚Äúescape‚Äù. For me this is watching movies, playing video games,  music or reminiscing about childhood. It‚Äôs brings wholeness and a bit of an escape from how mundane it is. Also friendships, relationships and vacations...it will gives a balance.

And lastly, aspiring dreams. I have dreams for the future me, and knowing that in my mind makes my life less mundane and boring.

dating,fooxumn,t3_g8kjer,1587948764.0,Yes. Party girls are the most untrustworthy girls ever. I‚Äôm not into partying and I don‚Äôt like when my girlfriends are.
dating,fomcvf5,t1_fombhm7,1587885508.0,"I just gave somebody advice that goes along these lines: Go out to social gatherings with people that are like minded (after this thing settles down) . I‚Äôve never had luck on meetup. I just got involved in my community. In community groups you‚Äôll notice that people are more willing to allow you in because of the close proximity. It truly is one big family. 

So for me this was a church group, it was also taking a class that I really enjoyed. And bam just like that I met a few women. Now not all of these three are for sure interested but at least 1 was. 

All it took was a few changes to my life and I met some potential partners.

& I think most people are following the guidelines. From what I have seen in my city, at least. (I live in a big city). Sure there‚Äôs probably a few that do break the guidelines. 

But if I were to put money on it. I guarantee you after this quarantine people will be more willing to get in relationships. It just makes logical sense. More isolation, more loneliness and depression. More loneliness and depression = wanting to connect. 

Anyways, good luck."
dating,fomaxhq,t3_g89bc9,1587883665.0,"1. Yes, I would delete them. Not a good idea to meet up with girls. And yup, I feel you. I could get matches but never ever could I meet up with someone. 

2. Yes and no. Before this pandemic I was talking to 3 girls, all of them I found very attractive and interesting. One of them was super into me and I could have definitely seen us dating. Kinda pissed about it, I have also been single for a couple years and I‚Äôm in my 20s as well. 

Think about it this way: after the pandemic is over there are going to be Sooooo many people that are lonely from isolation. Just think about how many women have had no contact with men sexually, romantically etc. So that actually makes me optimistic."
dating,foma7y2,t3_g89byf,1587883016.0,"I think you‚Äôve just answered your own question. You focus in on one or two girls rather than looking around at other options. Think about it this way, girls are picky. Very picky. I‚Äôve made out with 30 + girls and have had sex/oral with only 4 girls. I‚Äôve been rejected probably 300-400 times in my life, no exaggeration. Mainly because I used to go out to meet girls ‚Äî bars, clubs etc. 

Now I do not advocate going out to bars and clubs (you can‚Äôt right now anyways) Because I think it‚Äôs a waste of time. But what I‚Äôd recommend is finding communities that have likeminded people. I joined a class, I started volunteering, went to community events ‚Äî and bam. Just like that I met 3 attractive girls who I talked to. 1 of which I‚Äôm almost positive likes me. Unfortunately due to corona we haven‚Äôt been in touch. 

Anyways, what I‚Äôm getting at is go out and do something when this pandemic settles down. Join classes, go to community events etc. You‚Äôll be amazed at how you can meet girls just by doing small activities."
