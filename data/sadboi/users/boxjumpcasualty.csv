I'm an ELA teacher so anything needing to be edited or written is right up my alley and Upwork is filled with that. I think your skillset definitely plays into how much you're able to attain. A lot of things are still vastly underpaid but as a teacher.. well.. I'm kind of used to being underpaid for my effort."
