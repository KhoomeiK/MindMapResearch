JustNoSO,fpgqgdt,t3_gd3qfo,1588607643.0,"Was it consensual slapping on the ass?  No?  Then leave.  He‚Äôs probably just slapping you there so if he leaves a mark he can say he was just being kinky.  In other words, gaslighting you.  BDSM is a normal, healthy part of a relationship WHEN IT‚ÄôS MUTUALLY CONSENSUAL (using caps because I don‚Äôt know how to format, not yelling at you, OP ‚ù§Ô∏è).  I would start working on setting up a plan to leave him, tell your close friends only and be safe.  Make sure you‚Äôre not alone when you put the plan into action.  This is a huge red flag, and I don‚Äôt mean to scare you, I‚Äôve just been through similar situations and it can get ugly and scary quickly.  Especially if your boyfriend is the controlling, jealous type.

It‚Äôs better to leave now than stay with him and have it escalate."

JUSTNOFAMILY,f25k5a2,t3_dbtlui,1569976586.0,"Oh my god, sweetheart, I actually can relate to you on this.  My ex and his family are horrible.  When I got divorced, my ex had supervised visitation for about a year afterwards until the judge gave him unsupervised visitation.  My ex went to jail for nearly killing me, it was bad.  The system is very broken.

Anyway, my 4 year old would come home with obvious bruises in the shape of hand prints on his precious little face, and I would file a police report.  Ex always had a good story, and it would be ignored.  It got to the point where my ex brutalized my son‚Äîhe was beaten with a metal rod and had welts and bruises all over him‚ÄîI took him to the ER per my lawyer‚Äôs advice, police and child services were called by the hospital, charges were filed‚Äîand nothing came of it.  Child Services dropped the ball big time, and when I raised hell, they tried to say I was crazy and abusing the system.  I fucking wish I was lying.  The cops went along with the child services report (the cop assigned to the case could never remember my kid‚Äôs name or age‚Äîguess they were overwhelmed, I don‚Äôt know) and the judge flat out refused to look at the photos, saying that he trusted Child Services and the police without question.  This judge ended up giving primary custody to my ex because he remarried (judge really fucking said he didn‚Äôt think single parents were capable of providing the ‚Äústability‚Äù that a married parent could‚Äîwhat an ass) and my kids and I went through hell for a number of years, basically.

Anyway, long story short, my children are safe, happy, well adjusted and are in the process of moving back in with me, and that fucking judge has been disbarred, thank god.

Children are resilient in a superhuman way.  You just provide them with love, stability, and keep telling them and showing them that you are never giving up the fight.  Kids will always gravitate towards the more emotionally stable parent.  Be the emotionally stable parent when you are with them, and fall the fuck apart when they‚Äôre not around.

Hardest thing in the universe to go through is when somebody tries to fuck with your kids.  It will rip your heart out‚Äîbut you are not alone.  I wish you nothing but the best, and I hope you don‚Äôt go through anything as insane as we did‚Äîwe won the shit lottery, honestly.
