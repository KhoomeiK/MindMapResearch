In reality he told me he was single and made the first move.

So the girl and I entered into a conversation after he dumped me when he was going back home for the Christmas break. That was when the truth came out about what had happened. She ended up dumping him and us two became friends.

AmItheAsshole,f6lyuz9,t1_f6ls3du,1572963875.0,Yep called them out and they deleted their posts. YTA OP for making up stories.
AmItheAsshole,f6ka4uo,t3_drjp4t,1572908500.0,"NTA - I am the opposite, FTM. My work place put accommodations in straight away especially with my name change. They’ve been awesome with it. It sounds like your workplace is just being difficult and they do need reporting. You need to feel safe in your work environment and clearly that isn’t the case.

Edit: You can downvote but OP has been very open with her workplace about her transitioning and so forth. It’s simple requests that she wanted in place so she could feel happy and safe in her work environment. They are backtracking with what they said they would do. 

I was offered for myself a company wide email to go out but instead as there are 8 of us I told those individuals separately. On a larger company it makes sense sending out an email if it was discussed beforehand to avoid the confusion and gossip."
AmItheAsshole,f6k6brb,t3_drjeyw,1572905917.0,"YTA - a gift is something you have put thought into. I’ve spent £20 on a comic for my fiancé as he enjoys Lucifer comics. He appreciated the gift as there was thought behind it. I bought him borderlands 3 for his last birthday and we’ve both been playing it. I know my fiancé and he knows me when it comes to buying gifts.

It isn’t difficult to know what your girlfriend likes when you’ve been together for 2 years. That whole 88 cent gift is thoughtless. I suggest you try making amends by going out and getting her a proper present or making her something."
AmItheAsshole,f6i1srl,t3_dra2ox,1572870268.0,ESH - I didn’t have a car until I was 27 and the reason being was due to not being able to get a license (epilepsy). You made an assumption on him and cancelled due to that. He is also an asshole for blowing up on you like that.

AmItheAsshole,f6h20hq,t3_dr4yby,1572835197.0,"YTA - Reading your comments etc there seems to be no good reason why your kid is late to school. All kids can be fussy in the morning but as a parent you need to be able to control that. If your kid is struggling with the divorce, you and your ex need to sit down with her and talk to her about her emotions. Divorce is a difficult thing a kid can go through.

Also with those text messages, you are both the parents to your kid. She has every right to check up on her kid as well. How would you feel if she withheld information from you?

I’m not doubting you don’t love your daughter but you are making some wrong choices here and if you make things difficult with your ex it will come back and bite you."

AmItheAsshole,f5vi6p7,t3_dpbtxe,1572489921.0,"YTA however it’s not too late to do something.

Go to amazon, get some party games and have a girls night in. Have some alcohol but not too much as the wedding is on Saturday. Maybe try booking a table for a meal and do something before the wedding.

I don’t know what maid of honours are suppose to do but that is what google is for."

KeanuBeingAwesome,f5uvnwd,t1_f5srjk8,1572480037.0,Yeah I want more Constantine xD. Love the comics. I am so for an R rated tv show so they can tell some of the darker things shown in the comics. Don’t want to spoil anything as I’m not sure if you read the comics. :)
AmItheAsshole,f5uno1a,t3_dp98bz,1572476369.0,"NTA I use he/ him pronouns and I’m transitioning. People who have known me for years still use she/ her and I just correct them. These are people without a medical condition. You are showing a huge effort by using they/ them most of the time. 

The reason I’m not putting NAH is because of the threat to report you to HR when you are clearly trying. Some people to not understand that it takes time for people to switch pronouns, especially if it’s not something you have to commonly do."
KeanuBeingAwesome,f5sj3ua,t3_dowpja,1572432880.0,"I am an avid reader of the Hellblazer comics. To me Keanu playing Constantine doesn’t fit as much as I love Keanu. It doesn’t fit with what the comics portrayed and made Constantine very Americanised. The way I see it is an alternative universe Constantine.

The film is great don’t get me wrong but he is not the Constantine from the comic books. The one actor I thought did an excellent portrayal was Matt Ryan from the NBC series Constantine."
AmItheAsshole,f5rtox2,t1_f5pipfn,1572402768.0,Hey OP starters NTA. Also debt isn’t inherited the way your brother has mentioned in the UK. Debt payments come from the deceased estate. I’m pretty sure your brother has not told you the whole story or if this is even your dad’s debt.
AmItheAsshole,f5rsns1,t3_dottbo,1572402035.0,"NTA

Your mothers situation is not your fault. $3000 is a lot of money for a student struggling to get by. Like you said you doubt you would see the money if you were to loan it to your mother.

The $3000 won’t likely help her in the long run either. She will fall behind on mortgage payments again and will be back to where she is now. This is not your fault OP, it’s your mother being unable to budget or seek assistance before the situation got like this."
AmItheAsshole,f5rs4dw,t3_dox37u,1572401648.0,"YTA - public parking is just that, its public. It’s not the other persons fault that your house has 7 cars to park. I have public parking and I deal with it if I can’t park outside of my house. 

You and your housemates seem entitled thinking you can tell another driver where they can park when in reality you and the other 6 cars are part of the reason for a lack of parking.

I can somewhat understand the drivers anger as I hate my car being touched and especially with a note asking to only park there for 2 hours. Your housemates also ganging up on him more justifies the situation."
