How come Battle of bastards, the carriage one from s7, is far better than penultimate and ultimate battle?

But it wasn't bad though was it? Like GOT s7/8?(And I know GOT is not an anthology thing like True Detective so I shouldn't compare these two, but still, a season being worse than the previous one is a red flag)

 It was just different. I think people were expecting it to be a lot like season 1 and I get that because I was expecting that too but I liked how the 2nd season was different than the 1st and now I think if they had made the season similar to season 1, it would have felt like a cheap knock off or would've fallen short because season 1 was amazingly enough.

TrueDetective,fqaaw75,t1_fqa94u8,1589215910.0,"Yes on the surface season 2 seems really different than season 1. But there are some similarities, like the corruption at higher levels, detectives being done with the case only to come back cuz it wasn't done, the personal sides of detectives were equally explored as the case they were working on just like in season 1. Towards the end, Ray and Bezzerides are shown to be similar just like Rust and Marty. The black mountain stuff reminded me of  Cohle being undercover and dealing with difficult, traumatic shit, just like Woodrugh might've. 

These might be a stretch though because I kept comparing the season to season 1 and I was satisfied with the ways it was similar and the ways it was different."

Ray dies, failed to send the final voice recording to the kid. At least he got to say goodbye to him. Also, his name is smeared. And he was the father...99%...

Frank dies just because he made a comment about not getting a ride back home, why did have to go and do that? He was gonna survive...

In the end, Bezzerides gives a journalist all the evidence she had, but who knows if it will be enough...

It's certainly darker than season 1 ending. I was rooting for either Frank or Ray, either one of them to survive like I did in season 1 but they both die... Unlike in Season 1 where they both survive."
TrueDetective,fqa7qub,t1_fqa63oi,1589214311.0,"I think the story of season 2 was a little more complex than season 1.

I kind of get the story now, but when I was in the midst of watching the show until the last episode, I hadn't really figured out everything or rather what mystery needs to be solved(since it seemed like there were so many). But they nailed it with the ending, answered everything, I think.

In season 1 the story was really simple, and kind of typical serial killer stuff(after watching zodiac and other stuff). It's just: find the guy who killed the girl for most of the episodes and they do find him and then the plot is expanded further when they(Rust) learn about the group of influential people being involved in it... Come to think of it, it's not typical serial killer stuff all the way..."

It's so fucking great.

Some episodes felt really slow-paced and I get why some people don't like the season but it was the finale(or the last 3 episodes) that did it for me. I loved how they went with a darker ending than season 1 where everyone survives."
TrueDetective,fqa3ba4,t1_fqa1wyg,1589212066.0,"Yeah, It seems like the story was better and more complex than in season 1. Season 1 focused more on voicing the philosophical aspects of things(Rust Cohle was the perfect guy for that) and season 2 was more like the show but don't tell, had some dark concepts that they could comment over but they didn't choose to I guess. The detectives ""don't talk about it that much"". I really like the direction they chose there, could've been that the detectives would debate about it all like in season 1 but they didn't.

Thank you. But lately, I've been observing myself and my life with a kind of outside eye? Or something, and I've concluded that bad luck is strong in my life. Whenever I pick myself up and do the ""functional"" things which I know will help in making my life better and easier, something bad just happens which forces me to go back down. These bad things are periodic,  a certain amount of time passes, I recover, then the bad thing happens again, I get knocked down, a certain amount of time passes, I recover, random bad thing.

It's so fucking frustrating. How does one deal with it? If you know something bad can happen any second now, what can you do? A while ago, something really bad happened which made me really consider suicide. I have always had suicidal thoughts but have never really considered carrying it out seriously but when this latest bad thing happened I actually thought about getting the blade and slitting my wrist, but still, as you said, the human will to live is really powerful. I dropped it. But I know the next bad thing or the one after that would only get me closer to suicide. And I see it as something inevitable.

They are weird, they smile with this weird intensity. It looks like as though they are enjoying something that I can't see or feel. Anyway there stands Beth, my wife, she's getting along nicely with my mother and some lady I know nothing about. Hmm, now that I think about it, it's kinda weird that I do not recognise half the people here. It's supposed to be a family reunion is it not? I'm supposed to know these people... Well, I don't care, it doesn't matter I suppose, I just want this to be over, it's been, I think, hours and hours since we've been here, maybe more, I'm a little bit drunk. I set the wine glass on the table. There's a golden key inside a glass case  at the table.

""Whoa.""

I looked around, nobody was looking at me, so I opened the case and took the key from the velvet cushion and I stared at it, stared at it hard. A ringing sound fills my head. I suddenly feel dizzy, my eyesight is all blurry, and I close my eyes and hold my forehead. Then, slowly, the ringing sound fades away and I open my eyes. What I saw before me should've sent me into shock but it didn't. The people who had been talking and having drinks were looking at me, they were still smiling but their faces were blurred, wiped away, and their smiles were... Inhuman, it's hard to explain. But I look down to see, to my surprise, I was holding a white card, like a business card with black letters engraved on it that read: YOUR TIME IS UP.

""The fuck?"" Then I realised that I wasn't wearing a tuxedo like the other men in the party, I was wearing black. Like the stuff you wear when you go and rob someone at night, in the movies. I even had a black mask on. Also, I remember now, how I got here and why I was here. I'm a thief! I came here to rob the place, I had jumped the fence and climbed the pipes, broken the window in the second floor and slipped into the dark room. Everything after that is so fuzzy. Then I see her, the old lady stands at the far end of the room, smiling and waving like an insane person. 

Fuck. Now I remember, I had stashed up on some really valuable jewelry lying around in the some rooms upstairs and had decided to leave the same way I had broken in but when I reached the broken window, I saw the old lady standing there, blocking my way, she was looking outside. I decided to tip toe out of there, but she turned around suddenly and glided towards me, I was terrified, I thought she was some kind of ghost and that she was gonna kill me or possess me or some shit. But she hugged me. She hugged me! And I felt her hand slip into my pocket. ""Here's a dollar for your time. For candy,"" she said. And and I don't remember anything that happened after that, next I know I was standing in the party, I had a wife called Beth next to me, I also had a mother and father here. What?! I didn't know these people, how long have I been here? I am fucking mental! I started freaking out and the people in black dresses glided towards me, smiling their insane smiles.

""Nooooooooooooo.""

Being uncomfortable with women's sexuality doesn't make you a misogynistic, it makes you something else but certainly not misogynistic. There can be a lot of psychological stuff that can make you uncomfortable with women, and their sexuality(in Rorschach's case it's him witnessing his mother having sex when he was a kid, also dealing with her being a prostitute and the society's bad image of them being imposed on him). But that doesn't make him a misogynist. 

> **Misogyny** ([/mɪˈsɒdʒɪni/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against [women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman) or [girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl). Misogyny manifests in numerous ways, including [social exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion), [sex discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_discrimination), [hostility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostility), [androcentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androcentrism), [patriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy), [male privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege), belittling of women, disenfranchisement of women, [violence against women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women), and [sexual objectification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_objectification).

I didn't say that. But you justified Rorschach as a misogynist by saying that Rorschach hated sexuality, so I just said that I don't think hating sexuality makes someone a misogynist. I wasn't talking about Rorschach's sexuality and the comedian example was to show that your argument of a person being uncomfortable with ""female sexuality"" or hating it simply makes him a misogynist is nonsense."
Watchmen,fms4wwy,t1_fmrvmk9,1586346682.0,"Yes.

Saying that the comedian is a misogynist makes so much sense, but according to the same logic used against Rorschach, the comedian ""loves"" women, loves sexuality and hence he's not a misogynist. But he is a misogynist. Misogyny is not about not loving women or not talking nicely to them, it's hating them because they are women, considering them weaker, dominating them... is it not?"
Watchmen,fmro3wb,t1_fmrn5li,1586329381.0,"Misogynist is someone who hates women because they are women, being a misanthrope and misogynist is not the same thing.

Calling laurie a whore because of her outfit doesn't tell us that Rorschach hates women, he hates sexuality. He doesn't like sexuality because of his mother, but he also doesn't hate women because they are women, doesn't consider them inferior to men or himself.

I just remembered that he called the old silk spectre an aging whore... Hmm, maybe he is a misogynist."
Watchmen,fmrmnt0,t1_fmrlkh4,1586328010.0,"Being uncomfortable with the sexuality of women and not loving women does not mean misogyny in my book. Hating women does. And I don't think Rorschach hates women in particular, I think he kinda hates everyone, man or woman doesn't matter, if they're criminals, homosexuals, corrupt, rapists etc. Moore has shown very little compassion in Rorschach, calling him a misanthrope would be more appropriate."
Watchmen,fmrlhmp,t1_fmrk4b8,1586326911.0,"Yes,he doesn't like sexuality, hates prostitutes and  you're right about it being an extension of his trauma from his mother.

But that bit with the landlady is so much more than he just looks down on women, she had lied to the press that he had made sexual advances towards him, Rorschach calls her a whore, she tells him not to say that, not in front of her kids, they don't know, he then looks at the children with this look, as if he's comparing his childhood to that of those kids, then he leaves. 

That's one of my favourite Rorschach scenes in the entire comic, and no way that tells us that Rorschach hates women, it kind of shows us that all the issues he has are stemmed from his fucked up childhood. Calling him a misogynist would be wrong, calling him  having some major issues with sexuality and women and hating prostitution would be right."
Watchmen,fmrk295,t1_fmriqg8,1586325612.0,"Yeah I agree with you with him hating sexuality and thus saying that to laurie. But i don't think it's misogyny, don't think he's supposed to come off as a person who hates and opresses women. He is clearly a homophobic fascist, and maybe other things that I can't remember but isn't a misogynist imo."
Watchmen,fmrgufk,t1_fmq7ti6,1586322798.0,">But the fact that he became sorely depressed because he wasn't receiving admiration for saving the world

I think he was depressed because his plan didn't work, the world was still shit and they wouldn't give up their nuclear weapons...

But yes I was disappointed with what they chose to do with the character, which was nothing. It would have been better if he hadn't been in the show at all. He does nothing of importance lest you consider the last squid fall as the most important thing, I think they could've come up with a much better way to tie up the two plots which wouldn't have undermined the genius of Veidt.

 Honestly, the show was at its best in its first part when it hinted at all the ridiculous things that could happen, much like the comic did."
Watchmen,fmrg4yw,t1_fmq3rwe,1586322205.0,"But Rorschach has the much of the same dialogue in the movie as he did in the comic, how did Snyder transform Rorschach into a hero? Was it the edgy voice?

Even though Rorschach isn't the hero in the comic and in no way is the moral compass or anything close to it, he is kind of the main character because Moore put a lot of attention to Rorschach, we see his journal entries, see his opinions, his point of view the most compared to other characters. 

I haven't read the comic in a while, might go back and read it again now."
Watchmen,fmrf8nf,t1_fmqf8j7,1586321480.0,"Was Rorschach a misogynist? I don't remember anything misogynistic from the comic, can you tell me what was misogynistic? Was it the one with the prostitute? Did he say/do something to laurie?"

funny,fmhjwtl,t1_fmh8y59,1586083246.0,"I'm glad you posted this, the issue is complex for us but it seems that Louis has figured it all out. He has realized that even though he did ask for consent and the women said yes, they didn't really consent and Louis didn't ""check"" or ""make sure"", he kinda heard the ""sure"" ""umm ok"" and thought it was ok to jack off and stuff. It makes me happy to see that he understands now, what consent is and tried to give us his ""advice"" that consent *can be* a complex thing and you have to pay attention.

But, despite him laughing and joking, he did seem genuinely nervous about talking about it all. And he looks older now, and a little sadder... I hope he doesn't let the haters get to him. I hope people see that he is sorry and understands that what he did was wrong and how it was wrong. 

What people don't realize that by bashing a person who genuinely regrets his actions and not giving him a chance to redeem himself can be... harmful. Even though he has this new special out I don't think he has redeemed himself yet."
