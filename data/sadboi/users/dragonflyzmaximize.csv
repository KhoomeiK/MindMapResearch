For me, caffeine is definitely an addiction and it makes my anxiety AND my IBS worse but I still do it because I love the way it feels to drink a cup in the morning.

Interesting point about waking up naturally. Does anyone know how long after a meal your stomach is still considered full? I.e., I know you're not supposed to drink coffee on an empty stomach, so for me I usually try to drink it with my breakfast, but this is usually riggggght after I wake up. Should I prolong BOTH or eat breakfast then maybe wait an hour and then drink coffee - will my stomach still have the food in it at that Point I guess. Or considered not ""empty"" you know?

So it'd be cool to have stock Google Camera with all the features and stuff that actually work as intended. Battery life - the 3a got really good battery life and my 6 doesn't really get great battery life right now (\~3 hours SOT over a day).

Honestly just being in Google's ecosystem as well, probably picking up some Buds when they come down in price.

And of course, the new phone factor. It's fun for me to have new gadgets. I don't expect it to be an ""upgrade"" so much as some things to be better some to be a trade-off (probably screen) but it'll be fun to have something new.

Android,fp3mnh1,t3_gav9v7,1588282000.0,"Honestly, the last time I had a Moto phone I wasn't even getting the ""guaranteed"" updates (I can't remember which one it was but it was like maybe 4 years ago). So I'm even hesitant to believe this will get anything, let alone at the slow speed it was at."
AskReddit,fp0mf8z,t1_fozdx8p,1588212217.0,THANK YOUUUUUU
Android,foubkvt,t1_fosnq7e,1588080810.0,I'm very excited over here reading this.
Android,foubab6,t1_fora09l,1588080627.0,"Degradation is the biggest thing here I think. Although with a battery this small I wonder what that's like. But yeah, say they get 5 hours now. Is that 4 hours in a year, 3 or 2.5 two years from now? Cause that's awfully unacceptable. Especially when you can get a pair of wired headphones that never degrade. I've had a pair for like ten years. (And no I'm not like a 3.5 ride or die Jack boi, I've accepted the move to Bluetooth, though I'm still not thrilled about it.)"
chromeos,fou0syd,t1_fotfh86,1588072822.0,Not according to it's spec sheet it doesn't
indieheads,fort047,t1_fornjda,1588017989.0,"Thank you! Didn't realize you could do that. Unfortunately doesn't seem like you can do it from your phone, but it's better than nothing."
GooglePixel,forlsef,t1_for4x2h,1588014386.0,"From all the reviews I've watched (3 now) it seems to suggest if battery is your #1 priority then the buds+ would be better. That said I think they last pretty much the advertised 4 or 5 hours and Mr. Mobile I believe said the case can charge them another like 4 times in I think ten minute top off times. Initially I was bummed, but then I tried to think of the last time I listened to music for more than 4 hours at a time. Definitely wish the life was better though agree with you there."
GooglePixel,forlb6f,t1_for55pq,1588014152.0,Becca's reviews are not only incredibly helpful for day to day use but they're always fun :)
Anxiety,foon7cj,t3_g8g3pb,1587942355.0,"Yes! Yes yes yes. It's totally ok. Any anyone who'd tell you otherwise is living an emotionally unhealthy reality.

Crying is a healthy way of expressing the emotions that are making you feel that way. If you're  keeping those inside, it can cause some bad side effects down the road, which is a bad alternative."
Anxiety,fonmrzs,t3_g8daj5,1587922480.0,"Do you guys have any recommendations for when you may have drank too much coffee and are kind of bugging out, like physically? Like my body is just kind of shaking, my stomach is kinda killing me (I've IBS) and I'm just generally restless with energy you know?"
chromeos,fong1k9,t3_g8dt0l,1587918794.0,"I'm pretty excited about it. If it gets close to $200 I'd snag one just to have a cheap chromeos device in the house again. Thoughts:

It's cool it comes with a keyboard, though I imagine a lot of people will be using it just as a tablet? I know I probably would. That keyboard looks functional but less than ideal. Good in a pinch.

Bummed there's no headphone jack. I've not had any bluetooth headphones I've not experienced latency with (have the oneplus bullets and a pair of sony x1000 m2). So that's a bummer. I do have a pair of Koss porta pros that I mostly use at home and have a usb-c adapter connected at all times now cause my x1 carbon has this hissing I hated, so it's not a HUGE deal but yeah, would have much appreciate that.

Not really concerned about the processor? I mean for me it'd just be for like, watching youtube and browsing reddit, nytimes, etc. I imagine anything these days would be fine for that? I don't need it to be blazing fast if it's cheap.

Overall can't wait for reviews!"
NBA2k,fonf11o,t1_fonddxp,1587918237.0,I'll just keep trying -  I've seen it can be pretty finicky. Just gotta try different lighting I think. Thanks for the tip on the login though!
NBA2k,fond5h2,t1_fon4bjr,1587917191.0,"Ah seems to work sometimes - thanks! I've tried the facescan like 5 times now though and can't get it -___- I.e. it scans, uploads, and I get all the way to the loading in the game and it gives me an error Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"
NBA2k,fon43xj,t3_g3vhy3,1587911780.0,"This keeps happening to me - I can't move past the screen. It'll have the check mark. I'll click advance. Then it'll run it again and have a question mark in the box. So fucking frustrating. Sometimes I'm able to hit ""back"" and it'll take me to the main screen but otherwise I""m just stuck at that goddamn login page. This has to be one of the worst apps I've ever used."
chromeos,fojnfwe,t1_foe4plq,1587825269.0,"Aw man, no headphone jack? On a computer/tablet that's a total bummer for me honestly. Still might pick it up as maybe like a reader/reddit browser but I hope at least the speakers are good to very good on it (though I doubt that)."
hiphopheads,foi7g6l,t1_foi6fl1,1587780296.0,Yes! Thank you! Couldn't find it for the life of me.
hiphopheads,foi66u5,t3_g7gsnu,1587779540.0,"Anybody remember what the Kanye video was (I think it was around Yeezus time but not sure) that was just like, him in some big ass barn type room with a camera shooting him, and then he was ducking the camera for a bit. I think it was like 2 songs. I can't find it for the life of me. Think it might've been a single that didn't make any album, and it might've been on Vimeo, not sure. It's not on YouTube - or at least I don't see it."
Rateme,foi47ch,t1_fofga5q,1587778365.0,This sub confuses me. How can someone look like a model and only be a 7?
Phillylist,foh3boz,t3_g7d69u,1587760054.0,"Hmm - any thoughts on how big of a step down this would be from an x1 6th gen? I like the machine, but it's pretty overkill for what I need, wouldn't mind selling it and making a few bucks."
panelshow,fofje4n,t1_fofh4go,1587737147.0,"Ha, that does sound great. (It's available now, just ordered it!) But I think I'm going to read the entire book in his voice...

Just listened to the first episode of this podcast, should be fun! Think it'll give me something to do too, as in listen to the albums they're going to discuss the next pod."
laptops,fof9t5b,t1_fof9d9z,1587730615.0,"Hmm ok. I've got the WQHD (I think, it's 1440). Maybe I'll try some testing with it while I'm home to measure the battery exactly. But usually I'm reaching for the charger at like 1pm after starting at like 9am... Not too impressed. Otherwise it's great."
panelshow,fof7rah,t1_foeui8u,1587728864.0,"Whenever I've heard about his music tastes, it genuinely feels like he listens to just about everything. He released a list of like, the most underrated albums of 2019 I think it was and it was all over the place. I really want to get my hands on his book ""Perfect Sound Whatever"" but I don't think it's in the US yet."
wholesomememes,foe228h,t1_fod8hvs,1587694502.0,"Being down /= being a depressed person.

Source: am chronically depressed person, enjoyed comic."
laptops,foe1e3o,t1_foc52n7,1587694133.0,"Out of curiosity - what's the battery life supposed to be like? Maybe I was spoiled by my previous chromebook, but my X1 6th gen only lasts me maybe like 5-6 hours of work before needing to be plugged in."
indieheads,fochk5j,t3_g6n8dq,1587671402.0,"Digging this track. I also don't think Hollywood is awful - it's just, not good? I think it can be fun, I've listened to it like 4 times and I think two times I was like ""what the?"" and two times when I had it on in the background I was jamming out to it so, yeah.

Can't cool me down is still my favorite so far. That midway through the song ""HEY we're not supposed to be here..."" makes me want to dance every single time without fail."
indieheads,foch5tg,t1_foatssr,1587671280.0,I was doing this anyway right now - nice!
