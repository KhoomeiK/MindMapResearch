aspergers,fn63anh,t3_fz28jt,1586685734.0,"Fire Emblem: Three Houses or Persona 5 (or Royal now I guess), it’s really tough! Honestly I think Fire Emblem Three Houses Just edges it, i get so obsessive with it and focused, minor battles take me five hours with prep and major can take me nine hours, most of it is prep and set up to achieve optimal results in every category but even then it still manages to be dynamic 😅. I loved Chess as a kid and I haven’t played in probably around fifteen years and this really scratches that itch with extra variables, though it does take a lot out of me so I have to pace myself 😅. 

Persona is more chill but still has that time/social/battle management that I love of Fire Emblem And has Pokémon-like elements which is my favourite franchise of all time!

Sorry for the major Aspie ramble 😅 

Hope everyone is okay and has a great Easter!"

aspergers,fl6jcc8,t3_fmoix7,1584871561.0,"Yes, completely. I originally started off this message saying when it comes to people I am around a lot I struggle but I eventually just decide to try move on but I wouldn’t say I actually forgive.
If I don’t have to be around people I flat out don’t forgive. 

The saying forgive but never forget really applies to me but then I actually wonder if I ever did forgive or I tried to forget but not forgive?

Long story short I’ve had a lot happen to me in my life and too many scars to count, I don’t really think I’ve ever actually forgiven anyone and I hate it, I feel real guilty and like such a bitter spiteful person for it but I guess I’ve come to accept it that this is the way I am And things have shaped me this way and that I’ve just got to try my best to do better. 

Honestly, I imagine it’s so much easier to forgive if you are in a good situation and are happy if it is the opposite it’s easier to hold grudges, hate and harbor negative emotions.

I definitely struggle forgiving myself more than anyone but as I mentioned end of the third paragraph, I’m trying to do better and that applies to myself, we just have to try love and accept ourselves and others/the world around us, we will forget more often than not but all we can do is try when reminded."

aspergers,fkh2svl,t1_fkgsgm7,1584186352.0,I’ve saw this and will happily smack you anytime 😊
aspergers,fkh2qaz,t3_fiewty,1584186268.0,"Yeah my mother was exactly the same, she’s gotten much better now that we’re apart but whenever we’ve been together for long stretches of time (particularly as a child) I’d basically be her property and plaything to do as she pleases and mould to her will. She was very authoritarian and honestly as a child I saw her as complete evil, I couldn’t stand being around her, we had an awful relationship. 

Honestly, it’s not good for me to think about now because I can’t let go, and me and my mother have a good relationship now but it was hella abusive in the past; though she would always manipulate everything into being my fault. 

Heartbreaking actually, I didn’t get diagnosed til just before I was 20 and I think we definitely attract this abusive behaviour from people whether people are aware or not. 

I don’t even know if any of that makes any sense, so sorry if it doesn’t. 

Would be good if we could hear more to maybe help."

aspergers,fhf1kja,t3_f2ule0,1581534323.0,"I’d say, if there’s somebody you like in maybe the same class as you or somewhere comfortable for you to approach them. Just a simple hi, and introduce yourself to begin, if you get talking, discuss each other’s interests and make sure to listen! Show an interest in what she likes and her life, and keep in touch, get her phone number. Maybe there’s an event or something extra curricular you can do together, if things go well you still like her, go on a date, do something or go somewhere you would both like. 

Basically, just get to know people, and I’d definitely let her know about having AS after a few dates but if maybe the difficulties get in the way, let her now. 

I’m really sorry if this reply is overwhelming."

aspergers,fhez5sc,t3_f2tzkz,1581532897.0,"We’re the same age g, and in the exact same position, literally. I haven’t slept for a few nights. I’m not in a good living situation atm, and can’t string together a real routine bc of other people in the household. I’m in the middle of getting a support worker and help with moving out and getting support but as for a nine to five, I feel that would be impossible for me. If it was something And was tailored to me then fair but as for a basic ass job, I couldn’t it would wear me out to the point where I would spend all my free time recovering and would receive no joy out of life. I haven’t worked since I was nineteen and before that it was all full time and not necessarily 9-5 but it took its toll, it wasn’t how I wanted to live. Also I hadn’t been diagnosed at that point, but my advice is, get help from wherever you can. A Local Asperger Team any counselling could point you in the right direction and identify what you do want what you really want and then try with others to build a realistic pathway to achieving that, at least in a way that’s suitable for you. 

Sorry if that’s all jibberish, but you got this mate, I promise.

EDIT: I also had the same thing with Gambling in Sports though I burnt out when I tried to become a football coach."
aspergers,fhey4lb,t3_f2rsoa,1581532283.0,"Yeah, I’ve always kept a low profile and absolutely crap if I’m noticed by anybody. 

This applies to this cafe I really like, I’ll go a couple times regular then stop for a long time so that I don’t become a familiar face. It’s pretty shitty but it’s because I’m always alone so my confidence is pretty low and forces me to retreat."
aspergers,fhexs3x,t1_fhex0lh,1581532081.0,"Well I’m just getting back into dating after  a good four years out of it (ever since my diagnosis really) and it’s online bc of the way my life is now I don’t get out much. I think I struck lucky with somebody who at least hasn’t rejected me despite my conditions (more than Asperger’s), we should be meeting soon and though I still have soooo many doubts and it’s a long road, she’s the first date/potential date I’ve told about my conditions.

And I’m sure you’re boyfriend is incredible, and you’re meant for each other and leagues do not apply in love, can’t have a league with just two😊"

depression,fhbrfm0,t3_enrs4c,1581448293.0,I felt like that sometimes but that comes from self critique. Now I feel as if I downplay it but honestly I think what you’re saying stems from judgement of others
