RStudio,fgqd39a,t1_fgqbyeh,1581021967.0,"This worked! Thank you. Different question, I've seen people on youtube use (for example) just the words male or female when using cor.test without having to use vocab$male. How can I be able to do that for future reference?"

CarAV,exjx0vd,t1_exjw4kd,1566363356.0,"Im not sure if i have a remote start, it's a 1200 watt amp and the cap cost $140 and install was about $200"
