Also, if you are sometimes tired of grinding the str skills, do other contents, train other skills, do anything you think is different and fun.

Mabinogi,fnv7ls1,t3_g42tv8,1587283023.0,"Thanks a lot!!

I just finished my 15 waves with full 10 HP!!

My strategy is a bit different.

I didn't buy ice mines or firewood. But ice mines can save 1 or 2 of your hp in the beginning when your att is not high enough. I just used the 3 that are already given.

Buy all str and windmill. But I prioritize combat mastery instead of smash to increase att and hp. I didn't use smash at all but when I have some money left I bought it for further str boost.

For the tractors, don't rush to kill it. Of course use the kemono skills first to see if you can but from my experience, a lot of time they miss. I guess it's the hit box problem. But if they miss, don't panic and don't try to attack it with smash or normal attack. It usually flashes meaning counterattack. If your defense stat is not high enough and you fear its normal attack, just go away and let it pass. Otherwise spam windmill.

Mov't speed pots should be very important.

I would argue that actually the kemono skills are not necessary at all.

&#x200B;

BTW, I just found out I could try a lot of times each day. I originally thought the mission was limited to once per day.

Edit: Ha! Just found that you don't even need to buy the mov't pots or use any items. Just concentrate on stat and skill. Use professor flight if you like."
