humanity can be evil without a mental illness. do you think every single person that commits wartime attrocities, commits crime, murders and such is a psychopath? no, humans have other motivating factors to be evil, greed for example. Many of the most evil people on earth aren’t diagnosable.

Sadly sub-saharan Africa is somewhat barren when it comes to bodies of water so they have to spend more time hunting and gathering food and water. And such, it becomes a cycle where you need to advance your civilization but you need time to and that time is spent simply surviving.
