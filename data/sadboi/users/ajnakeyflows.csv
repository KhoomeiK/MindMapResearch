self,fggmtw5,t3_ey5nfy,1580765142.0,"once you connect with someone, a true connection will be hard to break if even possible. so when in reference to say she is not like other girls. it realms deeper than because she doesn‚Äôt cheat... she meant loyalty to her is before any temptation. she means she will always put you first to any man who desires to be in your position. it means her eyes only have sight for your face, ears for your laugh, lips for yours, hands to match yours. quantum entanglement is when two atoms bind together becoming one particle, one entity... meaning if you have two atoms in synchronization & you take one & throw it to the moon while holding the other in your hand & you start spinning the one at the moon... these two atoms will still spin in the same frequency because they have aligned. einstein called it ‚Äúspooky action at a distance‚Äù when you share the same frequencies with another soul, it will be hard to vibrate the same with another person. energies will never be matched & that‚Äôs because you no longer are ignited with your twin-flame...‚ú®"

AskMen,fgglgks,t3_ey5jmd,1580764334.0,"you have the presence of someone who reassures one when they feel they have no reason to feel a way, & unfortunately for you that means to them that you can handle your own issues & don‚Äôt need for them. as natural-healers, we tend to get left in the dust when it comes to our own emotions. but you definitely deserve more, & there is nothing wrong with isolation against others who don‚Äôt appreciate your presence as a whole, but only to feel whole themselves. a journal will be the best companion for those moments you need to release.. quantum physics is the science of energy, & it‚Äôs proven that a single thought manifests into our emotions which controls the frequency we radiate in our bodies which results in a vibration, that is then an energy we release into the universe. once we realize that controlling our emotions in our mind can result in changing the thought in which manifest negativity we then learn about quantum love, which means transforming & owning your emotions to control what vibrations you release. therefore no need for the vile need to vent to one, when you have established that there is in face no need for those detrimental emotions to take place."
