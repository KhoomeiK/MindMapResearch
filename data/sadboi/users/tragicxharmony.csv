I’m assuming you already know general things about making clothes look more gender-neutral based on the look you’re going for? I’ve grabbed a few free top patterns off Ravelry that I’d consider wearing myself or modifying in some way (they seem to lean slightly masculine or feminine but things like fit and color choices can easily balance it out). I’ll be honest, I put several of these in my favorites already to possibly make for myself in the future

[Simple, loose-fitting tee](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/217s-06-shine-cotton-tee)

[Striped tee, very little shaping](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/216ss-09-multi-stripe-tee)

[Loose tee, stripes definitely optional](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/219ss-11-unisex-carta-tee)

[I’d eliminate the curved hem for a more gender-neutral look but the color pattern ups the gender-neutral aspects I think](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/a551-ladies-striped-top-with-curved-hem)

As for yarn, I recently discovered [Lion Brand’s 24/7 cotton yarn](https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/lion-brand-24-7-cotton), and bought a *bunch* of it on sale for like $3.25 each at Joann’s. I used to hate cotton yarn but this is really nice to work with. I haven’t tried linen or linen-blend yarn but I have several woven linen button-down shirts that I love dearly so I’ve been meaning to try knitting something with it so I can see what that’s like

Hmm. This is a great gratitude practice, so thank you for allowing us to slow down and think about the good things for a bit.

1. People that are understanding about the wild circumstances. Friends and family members that don't mind when you take 3 days (or 3 weeks) to respond to their message because you were overwhelmed. Professors who email you to gently remind you that you forgot to take your final exam and tell you that you still have a week to take it for partial credit. Housemates who understand that some days are just Bad and don't hold temper tantrums against you (in moderation, at least). Parents that offer to share their stimulus checks because they're still working and I'm not so I need the money more than they do.

2. Warm weather and sunny days. In Michigan it's still only 1 out of every 3 days or so but those sunny days give me hope. We'll be able to be outside fixing up things and hiking soon enough, and even though it won't be like ""normal"" it'll still be great. 

3. My room, because it's peaceful and calming and looks beautiful, and I can escape there whenever I need to get away. Also my knitting because it helps keep my hands busy and my mind off stressful things

(One of my housemates actually used to have a cat named French Fry that looked a lot like your French Fry!)

I have many cats--I'm living with 6 right now. So I'll just tell you about [Ophelia](https://imgur.com/a/A1xUDaH) because she's the most recent cat in my photos on my phone 😂 She's a darling baby child! I've had her since she was a tiny baby, and she's almost 5 now! She loves stealing food, especially lunchmeat and cheese, and she's a bit of a gremlin but secretly loves snuggles. She also loves the outdoors and will run outside and flop on the ground given the slightest opportunity. Out of all of our cats, she's been voted the one most likely to win in a fight (she's pretty ruthless 😂). 

(Also, to make things easier to find, I moved the cat items that are for her and my other cats from my household wishlist to my default/quarantine wishlist 💕)

Thanks for the contest!!"
