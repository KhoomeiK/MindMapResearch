Sephora,folgaz6,t3_g81nmy,1587861609.0,"I was on accutane for 9 months, I just finished my course in January. To be honest, you’re not going to want to use a lot of skincare on your face. Simple is the best way to go, your skin is going to be irritated and angry and the less you do to it, the better. My course was ROUGH. I got every bad side effect you can even get. I was on a super high dose and my liver paid for it. I hope you’re luckier than I am and it’s a smoother process for you. I started using cerave hydrating cleanser and the cerave moisturizer in the round tub and that worked best for me. I’m actually still using those 2 things now and my skin looks incredible, of course now I’m using serums and other things too. You don’t want anything with fragrance in it, simple is best! The ONLY thing that kept my lips from cracking and bleeding is Dr. Dans cortibalm, you can get it on amazon. I would wear that 24/7 and then put aquaphor on top to seal it in. Im telling you right now you’re going to want to order some, it’s going to save your life. Some things from Sephora that I didn’t personally use while I was on accutane but would probably use if I had to go back, would be first aid beauty products. The wild oat toner is supposed to be super hydrating and soothing. Generally I think their brand is pretty gentle and could work for those on accutane."
