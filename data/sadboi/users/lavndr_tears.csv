mentalhealth,flsao7h,t3_fqib8w,1585437947.0,"I've been in shelter in place with my mentally unstable mother since Friday the 13 (when my city shut down the schools). she has severe anger problems and is now affecting my mental health. I feel as if everything I do is wrong. Every. Little. Thing. and she gets mad about it. she got pretty upset at me yesterday because I was apologizing too much again. She doesn't know how to express love and affection either. so all the physical contact I get is either abusive or accidental. I've cried every day since school ended. I would usually talk to my friends, but they told me that I've been overwhelming them, so I stopped. I feel like such a burden to everyone. I can't do anything right. and I missed getting hugged/ just being with my s/o as well."
