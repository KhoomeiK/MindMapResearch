lymedisease,fr5xhmi,t1_fqwn8ss,1589916305.0,"Thank you, I guess I can consider myself lucky because when I was 12 or 13 I told my parents the pain was too much and I wanted to see a doctor so after seeing the doctors until I was like 17 years old then I realized it was bullshit and learned all this new stuff so I learned it young. Just worried because this natural healer says my liver is working at 43%, so I guess I can’t take all these vitamins and I don’t wanna overload, but it seems like my symptoms got worse every year like the paranoia or anxiety depression etc. so it’s like harder but thanks for the advice.

One of my friends is very worried and they’re going to take me to the Lyme specialist and they said they will do antibiotics which I’m against, but it’s really hard following the protocol I’m doing with natural herbs and fruit diet.

Hopefully if I get a little bit healthy by this natural healing and then I can see the specialist and take the antibiotics I’ll be all good. Yeah the autism thing scared me because I’m really intelligent but I know what’s going on around me. People may think I’m unaware but I’am aware more than people and more than they realize just like my brain is on coke, but now it’s just hard because I can’t speak sentences properly sometimes and I’m so smart. But I do have support just sometimes I feel I don’t.  

Sometimes I just get overwhelmed because I can’t wash my hands at work because it hurts to look down and everything hurts and I don’t want to go on disability or get fired, and I have this extreme anxiety with paranoia because I’ve always been in pain in elementary school and the teachers would get mad at me and I developed into anxiety and depression unfortunately, but it’s good that I realize this because that’s all bullshit.

The reason I believe a sleep study would be good to do is because I've always had problems falling asleep since I was 6. I live is the U.S. and my primary will definitely  agree with me for the sleep study. I had a surgery and was precribed ambien and its helped so much, but I had to go the max dose beacuse it wasn't working. I took ambien a few months ago and apparently woke up my whole family, almost drowned in the pool and cracked my head open, so sleep medicine scares me. I took a test and it says I have ultra rapid metabolization of the drug Zolpidem (ambien).

The only medication I use recreationally is Xanax. I only use it a few times a year when I just need to chill out and get a good nights of sleep. I never feel relaxed. I've been prescribed every off label medicine for anxiety and seroquel to sleep, but never really had any luck. I was precribed Ativan when I was 18, but it never really helped, and since Xanax was in the same class of medicine I wasn't too worried about taking a xanax. I know that the xanax hasn't caused problems with my sleep because I never withdraw from it and usually feel fine the next day. I usually never take a high dose of it and just do it to help myself.

I was precribed vyvanse for adhd and it has helped a great amount. I don't feel very tired anymore and usually fall asleep slightly better now, but I still suffer from the insomnia.

I understand that the xanax should be avoided and is only a temporary fix, but sometimes it's just too much and I need it. I could probably get prescribed, but would rather not go down that path."
