When I stopped I had crippling depression and anxiety, horrible insomnia, nausea, no appetite, angry all the time. It lasted for ages, like I mean months until I felt back to normal.

Now, years later and after not touching weed for a couple years, I still smoke most nights but it'll be a joint or two after the kids are in bed. No ill effects whatsoever, and if I stop I feel fine. Weed is still a drug, can be incredibly psychologically addictive, and it still has an effect on your brain chemistry and can cause damage with irresponsible use, despite what a lot of enthusiasts will tell you.

If something ever happened between me and DH, he fact that she would try force me to find a rental as a single mum on a pension with a child on chemo and a little baby, that's just fucking atrocious in my eyes. Getting approved for a rental in my position would be damn near impossible unless I had thousands of dollars to pay in advance, which I don't have."
JUSTNOMIL,flj6njo,t1_flif17d,1585200614.0,"That's definitely the plan for me. I won't try control how often DH sees them but I can't look at them the same way after all this, so VLC is what I'll be doing."
JUSTNOMIL,flj6k2g,t1_flipuw2,1585200520.0,"Yes this is exactly true. 
My ILs have massive boundary issues - My MIL was doing shit like opening DHs mail up until recently. When they are over she goes through our dirty laundry to wash things and clean my house without asking for permission. 

They absolutely would have insisted on having keys and being able to enter at any time ""to check on the house"". No thank you. I'm so glad we said no."
JUSTNOMIL,flic618,t1_fli7ne4,1585179483.0,This is a great idea. I'll probably send this almost word for word lol. Thanks so much

Every mum I have ever spoken to has had moments where they are so frustrated they feel like hurting their child. My own mother told me the other day that she used to think about throwing my brother out the window when he was a baby and wouldn't stop screaming. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It's normal to feel that way and you've done the right thing by handing him to your husband and taking a breather. Don't be scared to put bubba in the cot and take a few minutes to calm down - crying won't hurt her. 

I experienced this exact feeling with both of my kids at this age. Hated being a mum. My oldest is 5 now and my son is 10 months old. It gets so much easier."

Frugal,fl2xbqj,t3_fm60nk,1584762402.0,Man over here you can get a whole 5 litres of cask wine for like $10. Pretty decent stuff. A bottle of sparkling wine is $3.50.

BabyBumps,fkstkh7,t3_fkgj91,1584498073.0,"So sorry you're going through this. I hope you don't blame yourself for this though. It's not your fault. 

So many things can go wrong during birth, it's terrifying. My daughter was born with a severe airway defect and was unable to breathe on her own. if I didn't give birth at a hospital with a great NICU she absolutely would have died. It's so scary to think about."
