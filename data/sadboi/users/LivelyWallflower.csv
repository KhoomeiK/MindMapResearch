These studies can so easily be skewed one way or the other, they can make adjustments in how the study is structured, how long it lasts, the population chosen to partake, other variables not taken into account, sometimes they use self-reported data to analyze people’s diets (which is a wildly inaccurate way of reporting), the data can be ‘adjusted’ i.e. manipulated to look a certain way ...  it’s a lot. 

And at the end of the day, there’s no way to conclusively determine anything with the types of studies they can do ... for reliable results they’d have to use genetically identical people who would remain closely monitored their entire lives, fed a strict dietary regimen and live identical lifestyles otherwise. That obviously cannot happen due to cost and ethics, so we’re left with half-baked guesswork. I think the only study that has proper merit is the N15 isotope test on human remains. That way we can figure out what our ancestors ate in nature throughout our evolution and draw loose borders around what is our species-specific diet."

AskReddit,fpcu9k9,t1_fpcmyyx,1588512845.0,"I might as well have written this myself. Also my mindset because of how I saw and perceived things growing up. I was always bullied about my appearance and weight because I was taller than most of my peers back then and also wider ... it made me feel like this awkward monolith sticking out from among the other cute smaller kids my age. I was singled out and it made me feel like an unlikeable ogre who just wanted to become infinitely small instead.

Once puberty hit things didn’t exactly improve. I hoped that time would give me the glow up some people get, shed the fat and I’d finally step into a pretty feminine body I always dreamed of having. And I’d finally feel human and worthy. But nope. I just got more body features to hate and be self-conscious about.

By the end of our final grade before enrolling into high school we had a formal dance event, so we all had to learn certain dances. My class had nine girls and about 17 boys. The dance teacher made us sit on benches set against opposite walls in the gym. So we’d face at each other. Then he instructed the boys to get up and each ask a girl to pair up with for that exercise. Nobody picked me. Eight couples were paired up and ready, nine more guys to go, and they all just sat there. They’d rather pair up with each other than me. The teacher was like ‘come on, someone ...’ Eventually a boy took pity and volunteered, but this issue happened multiple times before every exercise we did, every time we had a rehearsal. Sometimes the guys pretended to like me as a joke, and I heard nasty things they said about me, teasing each other about having to fuck me and stuff. 

In high school I made proper friends for the first time, which was nice. But I could tell as far as male attention went, I was invisible. I wasn’t really girly or bubbly or feminine in character so I didn’t feel belonging with the girls. And I wasn’t one of the guys either. I feel like I was seen as just this sexless blob who will help you with homework and maybe say something funny. Not a girl. Definitely not a girl anybody would like to date. I wasn’t even going to go to prom to save myself the torture but I was eventually convinced to join. I danced with my cousin.

In college I had a crush on someone attending the same course, just a year ahead. He however developed an intense infatuation with my friend and classmate 
as soon as he first saw her. We’d all hang out in the hallway and ‘talk’ sometimes because the two befriended each other. They would talk, and as much as she tried to incorporate me in the conversation he ignored anything I said and only respond to my friend, he wouldn’t even acknowledge I was there.

About two years ago I met someone on Reddit. He became interested in me and wanted a long distance relationship. I sent him a picture of my face at that point, in case he wouldn’t like me. He still did. I never sent him a full body picture since he never asked. I was so apprehensive because I felt like there was no way this could be happening for real and even work out, but eventually I agreed. I remember one time we were on call and we was scrolling through facebook. A former classmate of his popped up in his feed and she had gained a lot of weight. He told me as much. He said ‘ew, oh my god that’s disgusting, ewww!’ And kept going on and on about how disgusting she was. I wasn’t slender back then either so I couldn’t help but think he’d probably be disgusted by me too if we ever met. He changed his mind on us anyway and ghosted me twice.

Since then I met someone else and as lovely as he is I can’t help but wonder day to day when he might change his mind. I just feel so insufficient I dread ever meeting. I worry he might have an idealized idea of me and I don’t think I can handle seeing the disappointment in his eyes when we do, or the awkwardness that could follow."

Yep aged meat can definitely trigger these. I haven’t had that experience with dairy though. The specific triggers vary from person to person but generally low inflammatory foods that are gentle on your gut are a safe bet (plant material/ fibre is the opposite of that). From my research, inflamed gut or leaky gut can be the culprit for a lot of this shit.

My issues began when I ‘cleaned up’ my diet and reduced my meat eating to only lean poultry and fish, the rest was vegetables, nuts, fruit, plant stuff basically. Sounds super healthy right?

Supplementation with synthetic D2/ D3 is not advised. 

In my case the hives came when I started fucking around with my diet and even though the changes I made I thought were positive, they irritated my gut and that caused the autoimmune reaction resulting in hives. I removed fibre from my diet and upped my intake of red meat, animal fat, butter, eggs, etc. These are also important so your body can even form vitamin D and other hormones.

They might be worth knowing about but if their narrative skews so far into the other direction they’re highly likely to be faulty, poorly conducted, fabricated or biased. I’m more in the lane of ‘ignore all nutritional studies because of the limitations of the way they can be conducted.’ Instead focus on figuring out what is it that humans used to eat, instead of endless faulty experiments that are trying to reinvent the wheel.

Read Nutrition & Physical Degeneration, or Fat or the Land. Or just consider the fact that primitive cultures that ate in a way I have described, have been demonstrably healthier and leaner than the Western populations, and never in known history has there ever been a civilization that only ate plant foods. However there are civilizations that ate the opposite and were better off for it.

There have been isotope tests on early humans - we were largely carnivorous. How on earth does that not point to the fact that low carb, and by extension low plant material, diet is our species specific way of eating?

Or are we going to wait for a dietary study to prove this, which it never can due to practical limitations I previously described?

>Second, You seem to be trying to shifting the conversation from ""carbs are bad because insulin makes you gain more fat,"" to, ""Keto is good in general and maybe it's because of evolution,"" when I'm specifically contesting the former.

Insulin does make you gain more fat, because historically carb-heavy foods such as seasonal fruits would only be scarcely available right before winter, when people would need to gain fat. So due to that mechanism and carb scarcity we developed a taste for it. However, this process is inflammatory in the body and therefore not advisable to be done year-round. It’s unnatural. So really, keto is the way to go, because that would have been our natural diet most if the time, and in warm climates where fat accumulation isn’t necessary - all of the time save for rare treats. It’s  not really a separate argument.

>I'm not even trying to argue about which diet is healthier, I just disagree that keto has some huge benefit over CICO in terms of weight loss itself.


In terms of weightloss, maybe. But what about fat loss with minimum muscle loss? How about fat loss with minimum risk of malnutrition? The ideal way to lose weight is to reduce your fat percentage while upping or maintaining your lean body mass, and keeping your general health by way of not undereating. Keto makes sense for this because unlike CICO, which basically okays everything within caloric limits, keto enables you to eat to satiation, getting in your fats and protein (you know, the species specific diet which enables you to actually get optimal levels of every mineral and vitamin)and by extension raises your chances of being your healthiest self.

Why are people still hungry after ‘enough’ calories? This is the driving factor of obesity. Because the energy is already there but the nutrition isn’t. You cannot get the same level of vitamins and minerals while gravitating to foods that cannot provide them. Fat soluble vitamins and complete amino acids, iron, etc. are what we crave, and if we ate the way our ancestors ate, we could feel satisfied with less food because we’d tick both the energy intake as well as the nutritional requirements - the weight rolls of naturally without force (ie calorie restriction).


>Live off of 1500 calories off donuts a day.

Just because one can survive on this food doesn’t make it ideal. And losing weight is so closely tied to overall health that it’s really myopic to not have the conversation in regards to what is the optimal diet and what would work for the human animal as conditioned by evolution."

That is a bad idea. You’re supposed to cycle in and out of it daily, with your meals having enough protein to kick you out of it.

Cholesterol being bad for you is a narrative that is popular but entirely inaccurate. There is no mechanistic evidence to prove it causes illness of any kind. Cholesterol is an essential component in your diet, because your body can produce only so much by itself. If eaten in excess, it gets excreted with no issue.

Cholesterol is about fifty percent of every cell in your body, it is the precursor to your sex hormones and needed to keep the nerve system healthy. Its importance cannot be overstated. It also aids in healing inflammation in the body, which is why there’s a link between conditions such as heart disease and raised cholesterol. The molecule isn’t causing it, it’s there in larger amounts to help fix the issue.

Here’s a video by a scientist who delves deep into ketosis, nutrition and cholesterol: https://youtu.be/tVeIuzWIviE. I highly recommend his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChi5M3k_K4yuRpWAp00xBQA."

What causes fat accumulation in the body is an elevated insulin. Insulin is triggered most by carbs, less so by protein, and by far the least by fat. So eating a diet high in carbs will lead to more fat gain than any other diet with the same number of calories. They did a study, same calories, three diets: high carb, high protein, high fat. The high carbers gained weight, the hight fat people lost the most weight.

I recommend you look into keto diets, or r/zerocarb which both tap into exactly this issue by drastically reducing the carbohydrate intake and aiding in more fat loss without unnecessary calorie restriction."
bodybuilding,fkg03zd,t1_fkfn95h,1584146663.0,"I don’t owe you any studies. If I found one, or in fact a dozen, you would respond by saying they must be faulty studies, or that other studies negate these findings, or that the vegans involved in said studies were doing the diet wrong, or simply that the study was paid for by meat companies.

What nutrient is found in your bloodstream is different than asking how much of that nutrient is actually absorbable by your body. Plant proteins are firstly packaged in fibre (or the clearer name for it, indigestible cellulose) therefore that’s your first barrier towards getting much out of it through food. Second problem being that their amino acid profile is incomplete. You have to combine foods with varying amino acids and hope your body can take that shitshow and plaster it together into complete proteins. Unfortunately, that’s again an issue. Even if you supplement with protein isolates, which is your best bet, even still that’s an inferior option compared to animal protein.

So again, it doesn’t really matter what your blood content is when you shit everything right out. I don’t need to see someone’s blood test results to see whether or not they’re deficient in protein. It’s obvious by lack of muscle mass and thinning hair, weakness and overall deterioration. Just look at that charlatan that is dr. Greger, and honestly say he looks healthy for his age ... or any age. That’s an ill person. And he’s a doctor. If he can’t get it right then maybe there’s a problem. That’s just one person, pretty much everyone ends up like him over time. I’ve been watching vegan Youtube for long enough to notice a pattern.

Bro, you’re telling fairytales. There’s never been a quality long term study of vegans as a population. They’re often even grouped together with vegetarians in many studies. Nutrition studies are a joke anyway, they often just rely on self reported dietary reports ...and unless you took identical twins and locked them up in an controlled environment for life, the only difference in their day to day being their diet, and then observed changes over time, there is no way to ‘adjust for confounding variables.’ What happens in studies with adjusted data is, that the researchers take the raw data and make it into whatever they need to make it seem like it supports a preconceived notion. That’s what actually happens.

I ask again - where are your FAT soluble vitamins in their bioavailable form? FAT being the key word, because that’s the only place the former are found. Which plant has a layer of subcutaneous fat, please? None. What about dietary cholesterol? Where do you get that? Let me guess. You think it’s unhealthy to eat it. Cholesterol comprises about half of every cell in your body. It’s pivotal in the synthesis of sex hormones. It is essential in the process of myelination of nerve fibers. To skim on these essential nutrients and thinking it’s fine will lead to so much shit it’s inconceivable.

I’m not talking out if my ass, but you clearly are. I did this diet for four years and got seriously ill from it. I too was once a smartass like you, thinking I have all the answers in studies and Cronometer. It’s not that simple."
bodybuilding,fkfy8tq,t1_fkfvmeu,1584145386.0,"> I eat a diet that minimizes animal suffering.

And maximizes yours. Btw, what about the hundreds of thousands of insects, rabbits, field rodents, ‘pests,’ or birds that get poisoned or ground up during the processing of plant foods? What about the large forest animals they shoot to prevent them from feeding on crops? You have at least as many animal deaths to answer for as a meat-eater, except yours aren’t plainly listed as ingredients to your food. [They’re in there though.](https://www.rd.com/food/foods-secretly-contain-insects/)

> I’m big, strong, and lean. 

Says you. But not for long on this diet.

> My doctor says I’m his healthiest patient.

In this day and age that’s not saying much. And again, your health won’t last on this regime.


> I’m a freshmen in college and got a 4.0 my first semester at a college that’s top ten for my major. This really isn’t that complicated.

You got youth on your side but even that can’t shield you from malnutrition forever. May I ask, how long have you been vegan? 

> The people who wrote your nutritional textbooks were likely funded by the animal agriculture industry and you should try to get a refund on your useless degree if you were taught that eating vegetables leads to mental illness.

So everyone who disagrees is a paid shill? Same could be said of corrupted studies that point towards (read: manipulate study procedure and acquired data) cholesterol being bad or linked to heart disease, that fibre is good, that carbs are good, that fat is bad, that meat is unhealthy, or that saturated fats have anything to do with illness, etc. Nutrition science is really fucked and most studies belong more to the category of ideology and fiction than they do to objective science."
