5:30-dinner
6:30- bath, teeth, books
And she‚Äôs in bed by 7:00/7:15!

I know it‚Äôs pretty structured but after learning her patterns, this was pretty east schedule to keep. Just pay attention to your kid. When is she hungry? When is she sleepy? What does she enjoy? The rest will fill itself in with time :)"

Now, I‚Äôm much more confident and it IS empowering to turn the objectification I would suffer ANYWAY into monetary gain. It makes me feel sexy, strong and beautiful. I‚Äôve learned how to talk to people, and before I was such an introvert. I totally get that some people are forced into sex work. That‚Äôs obviously wrong, that‚Äôs slavery. It shouldn‚Äôt be counted into your judgment of whether or not sex work is empowering. I think you should just ask people who *chose* that path, rather than passing judgments without ever having worked in the industry. Just an idea.

Edit: to your comment about how it isn‚Äôt feminist: there are multiple scholarly articles written through out history disagreeing with you. It‚Äôs one of the oldest careers, and the first job that let a woman have autonomy over her own body."
