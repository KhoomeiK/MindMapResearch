Even smaller risk if you order domestically and not across international borders. Decent vendors will pack it up very discretely too. My guy usually sends it vacuum packed inside of a birthday card double packed in two jiffy bags. Gel tabs might have a slightly higher chance of being caught but still pretty much impossible.

You only risk getting caught it you order off clearnet vendors like Snapchat dealers. They usually have poor opsec so it's easy for the feds to track you down through DMs etc if they bust the dealer. Even then, the feds aren't gonna bother chasing up customers anyway. Always order off reputable dark web vendors or close personal friends that you can trust, and practice good opsec yourself. 

In the absolutely miniscule chance you do get caught, you're still very unlikely to actually get into serious trouble. For small amounts like 10 tabs they'll just send a letter saying your package has been seized and leave it at that. If they *do* try to charge you, you can just claim you didn't order anything, which is easy if you exercise good opsec and cover your tracks."

Hardly anyone engages in any degree of harm reduction whatsoever, and I can't say I blame them. Drug education here is terrible. Nobody tests their shit, and half the time they don't even realise you *can* test your shit! We have a free government funded testing service and NOBODY knows about it! Nobody knows how to safely dose either - I've seen people gum 0.5g in one hit! The most I've ever done in one go was 0.33g, which is considered a medium dose here. At least I had tested my shit beforehand! It's not uncommon for people to roll every weekend either. They don't even think to give themselves a break.

Luckily, crystal/powdered MD is *usually* good quality here (but that doesn't mean you should *assume* it is), so despite the rampant abuse, people who stick to that don't drop dead quite as often as you'd expect them to. However, pills are absolutely dogshit. Cut with God knows what, and OD's are rampant in the festival season, sadly often among misinformed 16-18 year olds. 

Despite the MD abuse here, the outlook some Mandyheads have towards other psychonauts is bizarre. I like to take LSD at raves, but I usually keep it to myself/close friends cos the reactions you get from some of the pingers is just frustrating. They either start waving their hands about in front of you and ask you ""what can you see?"", or they react like you just shot up heroin in front of them. The latter is way more common."
