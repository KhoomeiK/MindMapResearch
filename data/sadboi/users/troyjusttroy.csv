While we were there she comforted me for 5 minutes through the worst panic attack I ever had. I look up to her and care about her a lot. while we were there I thought she hated me, so her of only two friends on FB wishing me a happy b-day is starting to change what I think, but I still feel like she hates me. Fuck."

Social anxiety is just one of many anxiety disorders (including ocd, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and others). While most people may get ""anxious"" during say a speech, most ppl r able to get through fine, but with anxiety, its much more difficult.

Edit: To add, anxiety does come from evolutionary traits that are left over from when we were early humans"

Music,eo8dy4n,t1_eo8cusq,1558364249.0,"so, taking away the option to getting rid of the child is not forcing them?

&#x200B;

 If ur barely able to make ends meet and you have a child, it's not just an ""economic inconvenience"", it's not being able to afford food, not being able to afford a car, not being able to pay ur rent, not being able to afford medical care/ medical costs.

&#x200B;

 It also sucks for the child who has to grow up in a poor neighbor hood where the schools r under funded, so this child has fewer opportunities from the start.

&#x200B;

Also, I don't wanna have to play ""but I was poorer"" game with u cuz that shits whack, and shows how immature u are."
