EDIT: To be specific, I basically used Chihaya’s confidant ability to activate an alarm every single day and I’d use that to constantly boost pixie’s stats. A lot of the skill cards were also gained during alarms as well(except for Tetrakarn which was gained from hanging out with the twins). 

It took a lot of work but it was so worth it, and I don’t even think I’m done because I’m unhappy with simply “resist ice”. I’ll probably put pixie back in lockdown to gain drain/repel ice later.

Oh yeah, and obviously she was fused with a network fusion using Saki Mitama to gain magic ability(luckily, I got lucky and got it immediately, but it’s better to save before fusing just in case)."

During the firework scene he’s seen staring at Ann in a pervy matter, the same goes for the beach scene and even somewhat during the Hawaii trip and of course there’s also the bathhouse scene where he’s talking about how much of a bombshell she is. It’s literally no secret that Ryuji finds Ann the most attractive out of the entire phantom thieves and to me, Ann seems like she shares the same sentiment towards him as well."
