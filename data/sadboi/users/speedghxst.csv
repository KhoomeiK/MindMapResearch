depression,fq99r2u,t3_ghho9l,1589190731.0,"I got out of it a couple months back when I was really fucked.

I used to get panic attacks and desperation (basically the impulsive feeling of wanting to bang ur head on the wall repeatedly until u don't feel ur mind thinking fucked up thoughs anymore) it's a feeling i wasn't actually doing that...

But basically I realized that was ANGER. At myself for fuckin thinking fucked up shit that just made me wanna end my misery.

ANGER is good. Why? It's not numbness. When u feel numb u can't really do anything. When ur ANGRY u definitely can. So I put on my usual dark hip hop songs and starter running. I fuckin ran and ran. Until it hurt bc I wanted to hurt myself. I started sprinting until I could move my legs. It felt soooo fuckin good. I felt in control.

And that made me run alot more until it became a habit now when I run easily. Even when I don't feel like it I just go outside and start once I start I'm good. Running is a really good therapy.

So the next time u feel angry make sure u take it out on running. It might start a habit.

As for now what also works for me sometimes is radically switching what I'm doing. If ur laying in bed watching utube. Drag urself to the couch and watch something else (Netflix comedy shows) or stand up comedy. Something different but low energy enough that ur able to actually do it. It causes a slight chain reaction on ur hormones and ull start feeling better but remember if u start feeling it coming back immediately change what ur doing. And the more energy u have the more options ull have... For example after that u might have more energy to start chopping up some onions and cooking a healthy meal for urself.

Not only is it a well paying honerable achievement, it's the job u wanted and will make u happy through out ur life. And u did that.

Take a moment to step back and look at that. I wanted to be an engineer (due to mental issues i decided on my last year of high school that more school wasn't for me). I'm 22. I'm not an engineer. I could have very easily been one by 21 years old.
Life is hard. Really hard. So that fact that you focused on your main goal in life AND ACHIEVED IT in such a hard field. Is truly something you should be proud of and admire.

And think about it now u finished med school, now it's time for goal number 2. Slowly. 1 at a time. Life is a journey not a destination. Always remember that if ur pursuing a destination (having all those goals) ull never be satisfied. But appreciate the journey.

Dedicate some time to ur mental health once u finish the degree. Slow down, relax. Go outside, take a walk in nature. Without a goal at all, just simply existing and experiencing the environment. And if u feel like it go to a therapist, there's no shame in that. And mental health is serious, I've postponed it for so long and it just got worse and worse every time.

Besides that ur right if ur not completely into him there's no point in being in a relationship like this. U are both young (the age where what u do will influence the rest of ur life). It's to much and if u wanna do a LDR it would take alot and i mean alot of sacrifice, the type of sacrifice u should only do if the person means more to u than anything else.

Be friends with him, explain to him that it wouldn't work there's no future in that :(. Ur a young adult, go to college get a nice job, be stable in life, not just financially but with urself. After that, sure a LDR might be an option. But as it is now I'm sorry.

U either love someone to do anything for them, including giving up the entire stable future u could have had for them. Or it's not worth it.

Especially since ur from the US. If u were both from Europe it's not that big of a deal. But him being able to immigrate to the US for u is REALLY HARD. Even if u merry him u might have to wait up to 2 years for a visa to get approved so he can build a life with. Some cases are like 9 months... But especially with the pandamic its even more scary.

That being said, don't hurt him, he's also at a young age where (his best friend that was always there on a daily basis suddenly ghosts him) it can take a big toll on his mental health and might make him miss the opportunities he has rn.

There's alot of consequences.

Another problem is that it's a really bad time for immigrating, not just for legal issues or slowed down services but also bc everything is unpredictable. Everything might get worse with more waves and you're stuck in a foreign country.

I had to adjust my ""routine"" bc 2 to 11 for me is 5h more 7 to 4AM... Which sucks. But it's what we can do. When she comes home she showers, then at like 5 30 am for we sleep together (on the phone).

On her days off sometimes I feel like I can talk even less to her, bc of her dad. So we only talk when he's out of the house or sleeping. But we watch shows and just hang out without talking on the phone (makes it feel like her presence is closer).

About wrong time, right person. That hits hard with me too. We found each other at such an important development age. I meet her when she was 16, i was 18. She to finish school before we could ever meet.

Currently I'm 22 next month. She's 20. And i don't wanna imagine my life without her. I have actually and I'm miserable. She's everything to me, she's my best friend, my baby and my partner. I just can't.

Basically in older and i wanna try to get into college, and realistically protugal where I live is about the only place I could do that it's cheap and more easy to get in. And she wants to go to college too, but her grades aren't that good, and the entry grades for international students are literally insane.

There's no possible way i could study in the US where she's from. It's a fortunate. Here it's like 2k for 3 years for me. 7k a year for her.

I feel like she could get into a american college (not a top college) but a college. And maybe her aunt would pay for her college. I feel like if she never met me maybe she would have done better in school. Maybe she would have gone to college directly after she finished school. And she'd be happy.

I'll give up my college education for her and go there.  But i hate the taught of of she giving hers for me. She's a goal driven person and I've seen her without a career prospect before. She was in so much pain and hid it from me and it killed me that she felt that way.

After she leave i taught it was time to maybe be best friends. I realized it might not be sustainable for her career and her goals. I don't want us to have a secure life. And so does she.
And i just don't see that.

But the truth is I cried everyday. My life felt without purpose, if shes not in it. I know that's stupid to some people. But I always wanted a family someone to be happy with and i wouldn't want anyone else in the entire world. We eventually slowly got back into the relationship. We planned. Faced every uncertainty. I found a cool college program for her here( really good one) and that would allow her to stay and we could both build our career and not worry about the future. And feel fulfillment. If she didn't get in we were gonna get married and decided our next steps together. WE HAD TIME like a year at least to figure out what to do, where to live, if we go to college in Spain together (they have more courses) idk something. And we could just be happy for a while and figure it out.

Now I don't know when I'm gonna get to see her, i cry so fuckin much. And i never used to before. I miss her every second. I wake up anxious. I just wanna be my the only person that makes me happy. And i can't and i don't know if it's another 2 years before that's even a possibility. In 2 years it's probably to late for us to build any type of career.
I just want a life with her.

That's why I feel the wrong time thing. If we met after college or when we were more sure of our career paths, we could just be happy.

I don't think u should break up bc of that try to adapt make the most of it if u both think it's worth it. And that also depends on if u have ur life figured out, if u do then there's really no point in breaking up.

Try to make him call u at lunch maybe for half the time of his lunch like 30 min instead of 1h.

Breaks, on the way home. Of course he's gonna want more personal space. But ur gonna be waiting for him all day so it's conflicting but just talk openly about it. And try to make it work.
His days off are ur date days, cook the same meal have lunch together, watch a show together, talk laugh.... Ect.
Sleeping together on the phone really makes the difference for me, i feel her presence and she feels mine. Every night so it's really calming.

Hope this helps abit."

I'm 22 now and we didn't meet until 2.5 years in she stayed 3 months then had to leave bc of the visa. She was supposed to come permanently on 21 April. But... U know


Anyway besides the point we've been so close and i feel like we  really grew up together. And it's the most amazing relationship even tho it's LDR. I couldn't choose anyone one but her.

But u guys *literally* grew up together, that's literally so amazing. Congratulations. I hope u get to meet her soon. :)"

LDR,fo4wpab,t3_g5hi3x,1587512704.0,"It's gonna be painful at first there's no going around that, but after a while you'll start to accept the situation and make the most of it, i mean enjoy all the conversations on the phone all the laughs, talk about memories you guys had together, that will make you both smile and it'll eventually stop feeling so bad. And you'll start enjoying being together (on the phone) and just feeling each other's presence even tho ur not.
Call and just do stuff together without talking like if she's talking a shower and your cooking for example just the sound of her shower will make it feel like she's right there in the other room. Sleeping together on the phone also helps alot.

It sucks but it's not forever. And it's worth waiting for.
And don't try to put a time line on it. Since it's so unpredictable any bit of bad news u get is gonna be devastating. But the truth is there's alot of unpredictable factors. That might turn out good. We just don't know. And it's not worth suffering through it. Just know that it's not permanent.

So stay positive. Try an be in each other's life's as much as possible."

Drastic measures have to be taken *WITHIN* America. U have more chance of getting infected by an American than someone outside America.

The sooner u guys realize the problem is a president that has no idea of what he's doing, a president that doesn't even know the own constitution he stands for but yet acts like he does. That's ur problem.

Littrally thousands are gonna die and people are still acting like he is God on earth. 

This virus could be contained and controlled while slowing reactivity economys... IF U CONTROL IT in the beginning. So i know europe might open their boarders in a few months. But they won't allow flights from the US bc it's still gonna be a fuckin mess. 

It's the sooner trump wakes up, is demoted from power or shot in the head the sooner America might open its borders.

Littrally killing people with a random drug he thought off while he's scientists and doctors say it's useless. He still goes and buys a shit load of it. That's the problem.

But hey no point in being sad, we just gotta hope for the best and make the most out of our phone calls and conversations. It'll be over sooner or later."

That's honestly fucked up, she sounds really selfish and mean.

How could she expect you to be good in bed when, she doesn't make u feel like ur worth it?"
