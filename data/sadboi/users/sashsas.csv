AskWomen,fpxq1xl,t3_gfo6fm,1588987272.0,"in 2018 i entered another low and desperate state in regards to past love experiences and current relationship to myself, wanting to fill the void i felt inside, i spent much of my fall and winter in a depraved depressed manner.

at the first/ second week of february 2019 i met a man in whole foods while shopping and we sat and talked for three hours in the store, so naturally, comfortably, authentically.. went to a satsang with him that week, and also met up with him to hang out and meditate.

i restored to a higher state so quickly, and was one of the best weeks i've experienced in terms of constant flow state as way of being (have been in a very good flow at other points of my life to compare this to). i resolved my past issues within myself further than i had so far before. i felt no more desire to meet anyone. i felt so complete within (i don't even feel this good now, in love! working on other issues that later newly arose from myself)

feb 14, i went to a couchsurfing-posted event for the first time ever , a 'meditation and music jam' at the beach park. there were maybe 10 people there. the moment i saw one of the two men holding the event, we both felt some connection & both felt we muust know each other from somewhere. tried to remember where from ahahah. couple days later we are in a relationship which we both feel is forever. 

it'samazing how fast things shifted. gratitude to daniel the one who realigned me with authentic friendship so i could meet my love!!"

it brings peace and then brings power to deeply pause.

the concept that in order to change something, you first have to start where you are. and the very beginning is actually tuning into where you are. and being patient about it. and clarity comes from that space, from relaxation,

so we can look at things like dissociation from life, lack of purpose, lack of passion. not enough solitude. not enough interaction. not realizing ourselves/ expressing who we are and following that through in life.  emotions and thoughts and beliefs deep in the unconscious that need processing, or expressing

i recommend looking into the 'spiritual causes' of illnesses in general when suffering in pains..  i did this with intense knee and back pain during certain times and it helped me heal in a holistic way. it's really interesting how things link up metaphorically, symbolically, psychosomatically, not sure the best way to say it.. there are many good perspectives

you might need to shift locations, people surrounding you, interactions, habits, take an herb like ashwagandha (check out people talking about adrenal fatigue - it's probably even on reddit. it's very popular in general. but stay aware of what i said above because from what i've seen, a lot of people are stuck in the physical aspect of having chronic fatigue)

Meditation,fket2dy,t3_fhfson,1584120093.0,"the letting it happen definitely was important for me in certain scenarios. it's not enough to just relax. that can end up repressing the fears deeper into the unconscious.

for example i learned a fear of flying from my terrified mother. i could only relax and love flying once i had allowed the fear to rise fully a few times and allowed myself to truly envision the worst case scenarios, then accept that i had no control over that, then i could realize how the fear was useless. then i relaxed."

i think you could end up losing body awareness completely - then it can feel like you're floating above yourself - & then can shift to a sensation of being infinite space/void like soo big but also like folding in on itself like you're in a black hole or something. infinite space and infinite consciousness are two of the buddhist jhanas these sort of like categories or stages of meditative experiences.

thought you might find them interesting because you already felt that.

heat is the etheric energy on a physical level. you could start channeling energy through your hands - giving yourself reiki healing for example :)"

i would personally describe them somewhat differently, but variety is nice haha and  you can get the idea for how it might relate to your experience :)  i liked the way you put it; i knew exactly what you meant because i've felt it a lot.

next time i am experiencing the part  you describe I will try to see 'how' it shifts and develops for me. it sometimes turns into the awareness or the head feeling as big as the universe . there is no body awareness as you say , just infinite consciousness encompassing infinite space. it's so hard to describe .

you can try turning your awareness point inward where yu can find infinite inward/outward expansion/void . for me it sort of just develops this way after the floating and loss of body awareness , but you could try focusing this way and see what happens. like look back at your own awareness. instead of looking out your eyes, turn into your head kinda thing. lol I hope that makes some sense."
Meditation,fjijfu8,t3_fd907t,1583368972.0,"i feel this as well! I haven't heard it from many places before so that's cool :D

check the jhanas > 

from dhammawiki:

1st Jhana: Pleasant Sensations

The concentration begins with one-pointedness concentration and then when the concentration becomes strong you enter a sustained concentration which is a continuous concentration with no interruptions. You start to enter the remaining jhanic factors of aiming, happiness, and joy or rapture. You shift your attention from the meditation subject to the joy associated with your concentration. You do not cling to the sensations, but just watch them. The experience can include some very pleasant physical sensations such as goose bumps on the body and the hair standing up to more intense pleasures which grow in intensity and explode into a state of ecstasy. If you have pain in your legs, knees, or other part of the body during meditation, the pain will actually disappear while you are in the jhanas.

2nd Jhana: Joy

You proceed from the first jhana to the second by keeping a balanced mind with no clinging to the pleasant nature of the first jhana. Then you shift your attention from the physical pleasure to emotional pleasure. The pleasurable sensations, if any, get put to the background and calm the mind further.

3rd Jhana: Contentment

You let go of the pleasant peaceful nature of the second jhana which changes the emotional pleasure from joy to contentment. You experience a more motionless, quiet contentment.

4th Jhana: Utter Peacefulness

The fourth jhana is entered when the mind remains equanimous to the third jhana of contentment long enough that you are ready to let go further. There is no positive or negative feeling in the mind or body. Then there is an all pervading, deep peacefulness, with one-pointedness of mind.

5th Jhana: Infinity of Space

The fifth through the eighth jhanas are the “absorptions without form.” This is because they refer to states of consciousness where there is no perception of a form or body. They correspond to heavenly realms which also have no form or body. That is, beings re-born to the formless realms, which are some of the heavenly planes, do not have a body, but do have pleasant existences.

You enter the fifth jhana by remaining in the utter peacefulness state and then shift your attention to the boundaries of your being. You focus your attention outward as if you are watching yourself from above. You may feel like you are floating above your body at first. You put your attention on your body so that it feels like you are filling the room. This is expanded further and further so that you fill your whole neighborhood, city, country, continent, and then to space itself. You find yourself in this huge expanse of empty space.

6th Jhana: Infinity of Consciousness

You enter the sixth jhana by realizing that the infinite space you occupy includes your consciousness. So you shift your attention to infinite consciousness instead of infinite space. You may feel “at one” with all nature and existence, but do not be fooled, this is not full enlightenment. Concentration is further increased and there is still one-pointedness of mind.

7th Jhana: No-thingness

The seventh jhana is entered by realizing that the content of the infinite consciousness is basically empty of any permanent nature. We also realize that there is no “thingeither. There is nothing in the universe that has any permanent essence to it. We realize that everything is in constant flux.

8th Jhana: Neither perception nor non-perception

The eight and ninth jhanas are difficult to discuss because they are so hard to describe in much the same way nibbana is hard to describe. This is because they are such heightened levels of concentration and of the Path itself, that they must be experienced. There is also very little to discuss with the eighth and ninth jhanas, since the perception levels have become so fine and so subtle. You enter the eighth jhana by letting go of the sense of no-thingness and enter a very natural, calm place. There is such a peaceful state and you have gone beyond the duality of perception nor non-perception that it is easy to be fooled that you have experienced full enlightenment. But there is still more to do.

9th Jhana: Cessation

When you reach the limits of perception, you realize that lesser mental activity is better for your calm and peaceful state. You enter a state of “cessation” of consciousness where there is only a very sublte form of perception. The meditator may appear to be unconscious. There have been reports of meditators having heart beats as low as 20 to 40 beats per minute at this jhanic level. The nearest way to describe this state is something like a very deep sleep. The eight and ninth jhanas are not full enlightenment, but very close stepping stones to full awakening. Only those who are very close to being fully enlightened can enter the eighth and especially, the ninth jhana."
Meditation,fjijco1,t1_fjg3zqt,1583368918.0,"i have experienced DP/DR during some phases of life, and have also experienced what OP describes ; my experience is that they are distinctly different . what OP describes is an incredibly pleasant experience, especially as it deepens"
Meditation,fjbrzuu,t1_fjamml6,1583200137.0," i'm sorry to hear that! then my best answer is different - i also had pains that would not go away for years. physical therapy and then lots and lots of yoga. and diet change. and emotional work yep.

some meditation teachers have many testimonials of how meditation can heal you deeply and quickly; there are those stories and it is probably possible for any of us!! that it technically CAN fix any tensions. I can't say i've achieved that ' i have been taking the multidisciplinary approach lol. life changes, pattern changes, mental emotional and physical changes. 

poor posture would be a reflection of some trauma. trauma can be anything. like a perspective on the world that is damaging. try googling ""spiritual meaning of ""x"" pain"" ., trauma can be stored deeply in the unconscious and even passed through our family line.
 
 maybe try dedicating yourslf to Postural adjustments , research what you need, ideally find a therapist who works on the holistic level. 
making the adjustments would likely cause situations to arise that bring into consciousness and heal the original trauma.
and working through the emotional trauma with whatever practices work for you.. there is much variety depending on what it is and how you are comfortable approaching healing. 
hope something works :) maybe only takes one thing. good luck."
Meditation,fjbr0v7,t3_fbhtx4,1583199529.0,"ah yeah i experience something similar. 

the habitual state of anxiety is impressed upon most of us from everywhere, in so many forms. so once you do it for a year, years, maybe move somewhere more harmonious or whatever are your desired ways of naturally shifting that base state of being, then a break might not affect you. for now, truly healthy is the meditating yes :) 

it's nice to ask the question, to reflect on if it is an escape --- if you don't see any life patterns gradually shifting over the months, then this is what i see as using as 'escape'. 

the non-escape way, i would describe as using meditation to feel good while also using it to feel increasingly better /stabilize that base state --- not just continuing our regular patterns and feeling good only because of meditation. this can happen gradually and naturally just through the different meditation practices. over months and years. so we meditate and then use our expanding awareness and desire to create positive flows in life, to become aware of how our inner programming shapes our reality, our patterns of behavior, and states of being, 'shadow work'.. maybe journal, tune into watching/listening to your inner world more, read/watch life coaches or get personal support, friends, network, new groups, whatever works for you!  again over months and years. there is so much to be gained, gradually ! every day counts :)

Meditation,fja8giw,t3_fcc9t8,1583168511.0,"i find somatosensory relaxation/yoga nidra style relaxation is necessary before i can meditate most of the time. i focus on my breath and relaxing each part of the body. like REALLY focus. and go through all the little parts. and really relax them.

when the physicla body releases this naturally creates the emotional and mental clear states. if things are coming up this is natural; as you release your shoulders for example, your breath and your emotions or thoughts that were holding tension in the shoulders will start to arise. keep the focus on relaxing the shulders and on the breath, so hard that what is coming up just gets released thru your relaxation! and go through all your little parts :) small things even, each foot, jaw, forehead, mouth..

just focus so much on relaxing , even 'relaxing' your breath, that nothing else is happening for you. really pure deep focus. then meditative states naturally arise. from pure relaxation. because meditation is actually a natural thing. we block it out with our clutching to other states. so follow what sensations and experiences come to you while you practice this way. and it's that simple :)

especially while learning, or when coming from difficult states of being, it takes a sort of 'effort' the whole time sometimes for me, like you have to keep re-relaxing and when you do, you return to exploring the meditative experiences. :) good luck"

to help me to keep the habit on the regular i even have a schedule (flexible) for meditation with my husband :) i love it. not everyone needs structure this way but for this time in my life, I do!

also it's nice to remember you can do meditation from the physical level, somatosensory relaxation, and that helps the emotional and mental levels calm. Or, you can do emotional relaxation. Or , thought (dissolving awareness into pure ""I AM CONSCIOUSNESS"" eventually!) All work well for going deeper into meditation because all work together and affect one another.

accept that you are frustrated :)  this is why most people don't even meditate at all.. so anyway, if you are interested in and practicing your awareness you're doing great.

Of course there is the 'dissolving into I AM pure awareness' form of meditation, where any thought is dropped through transcendence methods. and many will tell you the most important time to meditate is through the suffering of having to drop and relax through those most difficult things to drop

Meditation,faumpqe,t1_fapca9s,1576349721.0,"depersonalization is common with deep meditation, silent retreats, plant medicines and life-changing events.

psychology would medicate it and sort of keep it in a container, whereas in my opinion it is to be explored :)

i see it as a spiritual dis-ease that comes when on the verge of integrating your personal perspective on your physical-emotional-mental reality with a greater awareness. higher consciousness trying to come in but being blocked in the in-between... we seem to stagnate in some strange in-between of these worlds, largely because of how our society is structured with such a lack of understanding of what this is.

see if the transcendent feeling is giving you more of a state where you are escaping reality rather than working through the dense physical reality to balance out your experience. and to bring that transcendent understanding into the world in your own unique way.

breathwork is amazing to help ground/ integrate physical and emotional/mental/spiritual energy.""When people are not connected to physicality and feel insecure and unsafe, they stop breathing deeply and instead breath very shallow in a subconscious rejection of life itself.""

different types of meditation, having at least one good relationship, therapy, some movement practice, diet, environment.. make changes in your life where it's more transpersonal, the people around and the things you're involved in have also tapped into some similar element of awareness that you're experiencing.

also realise your self as in your higher self which is the observer of your human-ego-identified self. bring that consciousness in to your connection to your feelings, to your power of choice of what you do, to why you are living. don't let anyone make choices for you :)    - this is part of the remedy to depersonalisation in my understanding! it can be quite fun to feel - but when it's not, refer to all of the above <3"

i close my eyes and make it my main purpose and focus to relax totally. i noticed that when i try to totally relax my body then if i take notice of each specific area, i'm usually still holding tension, 'clutching'. so you consciously unclutch. 
actually notice your foot, your thigh, if your breathing pattern is controlled or natural (let breath pattern be natural; just relax it and notice what it's like) relax your eyes, relax your shoulders. shoulders are an important one a lot of us are tensing up there. 
i often do a little stretching before i do that body relaxation thing. 
it can help for some to use breath so with each breath out you purposely relax a particular part of your body. and run through the whole body (more than once) and do this. it just takes concentration and a little time, & it's well worth it!!"
Meditation,faogwid,t3_ea70r8,1576264078.0,"when we are deeply physically relaxed, our emotions and thoughts calm as a byproduct. the physical body holds tensions according to our emotions & thoughts. relaxing tensions physically has a counterpart blockage that gets released in our emotions and thoughts.

so what i do first is relax my breath and body, first going through all parts of my body and releasing each. you might be surprised at all the spots where tension is held. you can even do the jaw, the skull. i often need to do this several times before hitting deep physical relaxation.

then i would do the breath practice for further calm and pleasant experience, or awareness practice to ascend away from thoughts - this second one is what redditkeyy described. I AM AWARENESS is your mantra; it is far bigger than any thought. by expanding into the state of ""i am awareness/consciousness"" you can dissolve all thought and ego level self-awareness other than the awareness of being an aware perceiver.

when you physically relaxed first, then it's much easier to let go of any arising feeling or thought. but say i start thinking some thought and feel i can't let it go ? use that mantra/concept to pull back into the much grander perception of ""who is it that is perceiving this thought?"" then the answer is 'pure awareness' which is the same within us all. it helps realize how miniscule the significance of the thought is.  any outer problem just becomes so small in that concept !"
Meditation,fao5kqi,t3_e9b9s5,1576257723.0,"personally i enjoy the lasting visual effects. never went away after one trip 4 years ago. but i'm lucky it's pleasant and while sometimes a few visuals jump out at me, i can focus on it or not. it's only become very pronounced with cannabis or microdosing.

i would recommend meditation to anyone. most of my answers on here are about meditation. but other things might help you balance better depending on symptoms.

for some, after meditation, silent retreats, or plant medicines, there is an experience of derealization. i had derealization/dissociation/depersonalization for years which leaves a person just not caring to fully exist here. hppd can support that state becuase it has the potential to sort of pull you into another dimension of awareness. i was in and out of it for a couple years. feeling disconnected, lost, uncommitted, doubting everything, holding myself back from everything caring about nothing.

it was the lasting effects in consciousness that caused dissociation from reality, not so much the visual. the visual just reminded me of the consciousness. 

it looks to me like an issue of higher consciousness trying to come in but being blocked from expressing thru. sometimes because of those outer-dimensional reflections giving you the desire to escape reality rather than working through the dense physcal reality to balance out your experience.

BREATHWORK. can really help ground/ integrate physical and emotion/mental/spiritual energy.

""When people are not connected to physicality and feel insecure and unsafe, they stop breathing deeply and instead breath very shallow in a subconscious rejection of life itself.""

whatever forms of support you choose, energy help like different types of meditation, having at least one good relaitonship, therapy, some movement practice, diet etc. to realize yourself, connect to your feelings, to your power of choice of what you do, to why you are living. don't let anyone make choices for you. gradually be more 'yourself', more freely expressed.. commit to yourself, find your self-worth within and make a path. design an environment that supports the things above, find ways to inspire yourself and see beauty around."
Meditation,fah4wgu,t1_fagq8a9,1576079227.0,"Thank you for this! i didn't know the term Jhana.  can see how i've been through the experience of them in meditation to the 8th, at certain phases in life when meditating a lot!

(personally i experience the 5th one a bit differently than it is described below. i don't purposely enter that state it just happens . suddenly its as if my own consciousness is expanding infinitely and i feel/see/sense it happening: ultra speed and infinite space while body feels it is floating and i see blackness which sometimes looks fast or like it is folding in on itself. it's hard to describe ahahah. or maybe this is the sixth? or both 5 & 6 experienced together.)

(one of the times in the 8th was with 5meoDMT)

this is from dhammawiki:

1st Jhana: Pleasant Sensations

The concentration begins with one-pointedness concentration and then when the concentration becomes strong you enter a sustained concentration which is a continuous concentration with no interruptions. You start to enter the remaining jhanic factors of aiming, happiness, and joy or rapture. You shift your attention from the meditation subject to the joy associated with your concentration. You do not cling to the sensations, but just watch them. The experience can include some very pleasant physical sensations such as goose bumps on the body and the hair standing up to more intense pleasures which grow in intensity and explode into a state of ecstasy. If you have pain in your legs, knees, or other part of the body during meditation, the pain will actually disappear while you are in the jhanas.

2nd Jhana: Joy

You proceed from the first jhana to the second by keeping a balanced mind with no clinging to the pleasant nature of the first jhana. Then you shift your attention from the physical pleasure to emotional pleasure. The pleasurable sensations, if any, get put to the background and calm the mind further.

3rd Jhana: Contentment

You let go of the pleasant peaceful nature of the second jhana which changes the emotional pleasure from joy to contentment. You experience a more motionless, quiet contentment.

4th Jhana: Utter Peacefulness

The fourth jhana is entered when the mind remains equanimous to the third jhana of contentment long enough that you are ready to let go further. There is no positive or negative feeling in the mind or body. Then there is an all pervading, deep peacefulness, with one-pointedness of mind.

5th Jhana: Infinity of Space

The fifth through the eighth jhanas are the “absorptions without form.” This is because they refer to states of consciousness where there is no perception of a form or body. They correspond to heavenly realms which also have no form or body. That is, beings re-born to the formless realms, which are some of the heavenly planes, do not have a body, but do have pleasant existences.

You enter the fifth jhana by remaining in the utter peacefulness state and then shift your attention to the boundaries of your being. You focus your attention outward as if you are watching yourself from above. You may feel like you are floating above your body at first. You put your attention on your body so that it feels like you are filling the room. This is expanded further and further so that you fill your whole neighborhood, city, country, continent, and then to space itself. You find yourself in this huge expanse of empty space.

6th Jhana: Infinity of Consciousness

You enter the sixth jhana by realizing that the infinite space you occupy includes your consciousness. So you shift your attention to infinite consciousness instead of infinite space. You may feel “at one” with all nature and existence, but do not be fooled, this is not full enlightenment. Concentration is further increased and there is still one-pointedness of mind.

7th Jhana: No-thingness

The seventh jhana is entered by realizing that the content of the infinite consciousness is basically empty of any permanent nature. We also realize that there is no “thingeither. There is nothing in the universe that has any permanent essence to it. We realize that everything is in constant flux.

8th Jhana: Neither perception nor non-perception

The eight and ninth jhanas are difficult to discuss because they are so hard to describe in much the same way nibbana is hard to describe. This is because they are such heightened levels of concentration and of the Path itself, that they must be experienced. There is also very little to discuss with the eighth and ninth jhanas, since the perception levels have become so fine and so subtle. You enter the eighth jhana by letting go of the sense of no-thingness and enter a very natural, calm place. There is such a peaceful state and you have gone beyond the duality of perception nor non-perception that it is easy to be fooled that you have experienced full enlightenment. But there is still more to do.

9th Jhana: Cessation

When you reach the limits of perception, you realize that lesser mental activity is better for your calm and peaceful state. You enter a state of “cessation” of consciousness where there is only a very sublte form of perception. The meditator may appear to be unconscious. There have been reports of meditators having heart beats as low as 20 to 40 beats per minute at this jhanic level. The nearest way to describe this state is something like a very deep sleep. The eight and ninth jhanas are not full enlightenment, but very close stepping stones to full awakening. Only those who are very close to being fully enlightened can enter the eighth and especially, the ninth jhana."
Meditation,fabwm1i,t3_e8etn7,1575929984.0,"humanity is in a state of thinking all the time, while feeling dissonant emotions, and experiencing unpleasant physical symptoms, which is generally caused by the misalignment of the physical-emotional-mental 'bodies' or areas. the ideal state is when all three are in harmony, so that we do not subconsciously sabotage ourselves. all three might be creating realities that go against what each other one desires or thinks it desires. like constantly desiring a better body but never physically addressing that, for a simple example. or your heart pains for a good relationship but we don't believe in the possibility of it enough to go out and make it happen. forms of meditation can help to expand peace/harmony/consciousness in any of these layers and helping one helps all three. there are a lot of techniques for meditation.

i'm pretty mentally driven and it's hard to just drop away from my mind into nothingness. so, the main way i like to go about meditating is to first relax the physical body. i run through the body consciously, breathing is relaxed, focusing only on relaxing the physical body. checking areas and releasing them. you'll probably find you are 'holding' in places or have tensions. keep relaxing for a while. focus SO much on doing this that you aren't thinking or feeling anything except what is related to this practice. doing this, sometimes right away and sometimes after some time, i feel emotional & mental relaxation is being created. then you are in a state where can do any type of meditation more effectively.

my favorite is ""I AM"" meditation where your 'mantra' (sort of the concept that creates your point of focus) is ""i am awareness/consciousness"" and with this mantra you can dissolve all thought and self-awareness other than the awareness of being an aware perceiver. it's pretty peaceful.

if i have first done the physical relaxation, then it's much easier to maneuver in the mind and 'just let go' because you are feeling so good and relaxed that negative thoughts don't feel relevant. but say i start thinking some thought and feel i can't let it go? use that mantra/concept to pull back into the much grander perception of ""who is it that is perceiving this thought?"" then the answer is 'pure awareness' which is the same within us all. and any outer problem just becomes so small in that concept. it helps realize how miniscule the significance of the thought is.

strange to describe in words but the experience is otherworldly & so peaceful.

or pulling your focus inwards, reversing our typical outward focus, into the center of your head. and just remain focused here. or pulling your focus into the center of your heart. i don't know what these are called i just have figured out i enjoy them :)

there are a huge variety of meditations, relaxations, breathwork, yogas etc guided for free online. the top quality or the ones you'll really like might be only a small portion of what's there but don't give up! and there might also be meditation classes at a yoga studio near you. or buddhist centers often have them for free."
Meditation,faak53m,t3_e60v7l,1575909875.0,"some of us will smoke and be brought into more sensitivity that is needed to better perceive your consciousness and life around. smoke as much as helps you live more aligned, meditate more easily etc.

that one sounds like you. have fun with the cannabis. however if you NEED it, check and see if you are relying on it to help rather than using it as a self-development tool. it brings you into a good state, now do you try and integrate that state into daily life and make changes and decisions based on creating more pleasant non-plant-supported reality as well?

don't be influenced by popular opinion. and by 'spiritual' opinion. listen to your own experience. way above all external opinion. smoke and let it help you feel your etheric body and open astral perception. meditate and totally relax. cannabis can accelerate this. then meditation can go into higher states.

for some of us, if the plant medicine experience is unpleasant it can be showing you something, when your sensitivity is opened it is revealing something internal in perception that was always there but you felt much better ignoring it. but it is useful to see that you have this in your subconscious. now actually work on that. or, showing you how significant the environment is, how low-consciousness people and environments can affect us very intensively and we allow ourselves to get lost in these things before we are astrally strong. without the medicine we can remain lost in these realms without even knowing it.

some of us are already hypersensitive and smoking can accentuate that too much.  you don't need much or any plant medicine if you are hypersensitive. meditate. learn how to develop this sensitivity by paying attention to physical consumption and environment (internal and external) and care, emotional and mental care , focus and introspection."
Meditation,faahrv8,t3_e6s7e4,1575908985.0,"it's nice the way you leave it so open. my partner does the same as you.

she needs to be inspired to meditate somehow. learning the benefits could help (physical emotional mental). it takes dedication to practice and belief in your power to change your reality/life.

you CAN put thinking away. many of us humans are so deep in beta wave mental control that it is pretty much at the level of ego death to let go of that control.... it's a real challenge. so worthwhile to go through of course, but she will have to be motivated to go through that. sometimes it will take an external life event, or your thoughts precipitating into such unpleasant emotional and physical experience, before that motivation clicks.

meditation won't work if you are so deep in anxiety (just in my experience - maybe some people can sit in that deathly mental place- takes a lot of power). I recommend to start with relaxing on the physical level, maybe this works for me best because i am overly mentally focused. i start by relaxing the breath and running through body scanning. notice if each part of you is relaxed, or tensed. send consciousness to each part of the body and relax it in the beginning when you sit down to meditate (or sit down to do yoga nidra or somatorelease therapy which is pretty much this, just systematized. it can help to start with systems just don't get attached/stuck!) i run through the body more than once depending on the state i am starting from. this will gradually help to calm the emotional and mental layers.

i have felt ""can't just put that away"" for suuure. like, ""i CANNOT let go of this thought... what if i don't remember it again!?!?!?"". i would stop my 'trying to meditate' and write down some stuff, to do and whatever. and then still not be able to stop thinking about it. no.. this is anxiety. this is not the harmonic human condition. a lot of people 'have' anxiety or depression, but don't even know it. they haven't experienced anything different yet. we can stay there forever or we can take the 'risk' of letting go (it feels like a risk - it isn't of course you're safe haha).\*edit\* want to add, that if letting go of these thoughts makes her life as it is fall apart, maybe life as it is needs to fall apart.

obviously this is not all about your girlfriend it's just what i feel about this topic. i hope it helps.

it depends on your relationship, but in many cases it is not as well received when your significant other is the 'teacher' in certain areas of life. she might be able to receive this well from you. or maybe she's willing to read something like the power of now. he's really explaining this stuff in a spiritual science kind of way in that book. i put off reading it for a long time. i was pleasantly surprised."
Meditation,fa1h5fq,t1_fa0d1u0,1575769778.0,"i do it by sort of 'sending' my consciousness to that part. i imagine i am IN the center of my toe. for me that works once i have found a comfy position & scanned through to relax all parts of my body more than once which helps relax breath and mind .

you can listen to yoga nidra to help but i find they tend to go through too fast"
Meditation,f9op70e,t3_e3j846,1575510079.0,"for some, after meditation, silent retreats, and plant medicines, there is an experience of derealization. 

i was in and out of it for a couple years. feeling disconnected, lost, uncommitted, doubting everything, holding myself back. 

it looks to me like an issue of higher consciousness being blocked from expressing thru. sometimes because of trying to transcend and the desire to escape working through the dense physcal reality rather than to express and bring into reality whatever life you want to build, via that new power, that superconscious void you might have just tapped into. 

to realize yourself, connect to  your feelings, to your power of choice of what you do, to why you are living. don't let anyone make choices for you. gradually be more 'yourself', more freely expressed.. commit to yourself, find your self-worth within and make a path. 

yes this takes some time probably! and whatever forms of support you choose, energy help like different types of meditation, having at least one good relaitonship, therapy,  some movement practice, diet etc.

Meditation,f9oo4ca,t3_e331a5,1575509343.0,"i think you're asking if there is a way of being in a state of loving your appearance without making it a condition of your self-image? think of if you are placing more of your self-value in the hands of others or if you can switch it to putting more value on your internal self esteem. 

it's probably a great thing that you are so conscious of critiquing your experience of this, but don't beat yourself up over it

you can use this experience to boost appreciation for yourself, yet think of it like a phase or step of loving yourself. physical self-care is one of the many components of naturally treating yourself well. you get to experience a sort of ego based love for yourself in a form that you haven't experienced before. grow your self-awareness in other areas , emotional and mental areas, so you can have internal self-esteem gradually expanding. imagine the 'attractiveness' of people who are so obviously peaceful, who look bright, or who look secure within themselves. work toward these gradually and you can balance out the experience you describe .

you deserve a healthy ego, it will grow, this is only the beginning. there is a 'good' form of ego to have; self-worth and confidence, which we all want and need to fulfill our potential. You are nooot alone in needing to work on this stuff. much of humanity is in the same boat. or they have other different issues to evolve thru :)"

Meditation,f9k2ern,t3_e4zrvl,1575391316.0,"we create our physical experience from the precipitation down from thoughts to emotions it's more complicated than that of course but if you feel heat you have a lot going on on those levels and your physical body is telling you about it. it can happen because of either positive or negative overactivity, seems like yours at the moment isfrom stress. if you could find a way to continue meditating through all that, it will resolve. the meditation is allowing you to resolve on other levels-

root-earth sacral-water solar- fire heart-air throat-ether third eye-astral crown-mental & opening to more layers... these also correspond in-depth with kabbalah, human design, et cetera. there are a lot of names for these things from the ancient traditions but to go with basic chakras, a common one around today, just mentioning the above. they correspond to the endocrine glands, and to the emotions and thoughts on each level of consciousness creating each effect in the physical"

Meditation,f9399bu,t3_e2u3b1,1575053127.0,"have you tried yoga nidra (a kind of meditation)? it can bring me the tinglings . it's all about how much you can relax. going into meditation, only focus on relaxing until you have sent your consciousness to every part of your body and totally released any clutching of it. you might have to run through allll the parts while just breathing (no breath control- release breath too). listening for your heartbeat once relaxed physically is a way to facilitate the next layers-  emotionally and mentally relaxing

&#x200B;

as your system develops through meditation and other perspective shifting things (physical emotional and mental shifting) , you might find it harder to 'process' the new energies running thru. that can be why it's harder to relax. but if you could, it would bring all new expereinces beyond tingling and the visuals you directed before...

&#x200B;

i'm re-explaining these basics because in my experience i am always going back to them each time i 'up-level' in consciousness, perceptions, and such.

maybe this is you t oo. best of luck

i was never focused on visualizing and moreso had visuals pop up. i heard from others, when the effectiveness of visualization ceased and the new level to practice is to feel the feeling of if you were in whatever state  you would have visualized. as you said you were doing this though, experiencing the feelings, were you ever doing this without visualization? try that too maybe."

when consistently meditating i lose contact with bodily awareness as well.  i also do yin and yoga nidra and do get into deep conscious body sensing that way. but this one like you describe is another direction to move consciousness in meditation. where if i try to realize my body it feels very unreal. where sometimes i sense super macro expansion like first the consciousness is floating away from body attachment and then encompasses infinite blackness like the size of the universe or something. it feels like perfect balance, never want to leave. just contentment."

if you stop these fears just go more unconscious and deeper again. it is actually a good thing even though that might feel pretty bad to feel. now you know what was always there. 

amanda flaker's videos helped me with what to do to work through and out of this. she talks about 'unplugging yourself from the lack matrix' and there is fear preventing you, then guilt coming from inside and outside sources when you're trying to do it (like who are you to think you don't have to lead the same shitty life everyone else does in fear of going outside the norm? do you think you're better than us?), then shame maybe mostly from within when you're beyond the guilt, et cetera. but when you are really free of it all your creative energy is free of the 'lack matrix' so now without that energy drainage you simply have to trust that you will be able to sustain yourself outside of that collectively imprinted template, and feel what to do. she explains it all way better; she has soo many videos up on YT so just try one whatever one you feel like you might like!!! best of luck :)

it can also help to stop feeling like you're bad to have those fears because 99 percent of humanity has it just the same, and so that awareness can help you  be at peace with the problem a little bit before you go in trying to fix it or anything. it's not you, it's the human condition. and a lot of people are 'awakening' out of it right now so there is someone to show you the way a little bit for sure. there are all styles of awakening , pretty much  already something for anyone i wanna say. also try not to get turned away from it by seeing one version of it that you don't like! that kind just works for someone else. ok again good luck to you :))"

do we know that rocks and air do not experience? maybe they are 3rd dimensional consciousness, while humanity is now in 4th or 5th at the average. something akin to this concept.

dissociation has to do with the awakening of chakras above the crown. i was 'stuck' in dissociative states for years, in and out.

it is difficult to discuss dissociation with anyone. there are hardly words. i would avoid the average psychological approach, though some systems might be able to help, maybe you will sense what is best. it is a spiritual dis-ease; seek spiritual measures."

every suffering is valid
And deserves to be fully listened to, accepted, respected. ..
Only then it can be learned from and you can move upwards out of it.. 

if people can’t listen , it’s a reflection of how far they have met themselves. if your suffering is not respected it’s because 90 percent of earth doesn’t take a look inside themselves at their suffering and solve it through the see-accept-learn pattern .. 

Instead they suppress!! 
And by what they’re telling you they’re teaching you to continue that pattern of suppression .... 

improve yourself before trying to show the people who may mistreat you that they are doing it wrong. it comes out of their own unconscious pain so try and have compassion towards that. They were taught to cope like that ... 

no one can be forced to see this stuff for what it is. We have to desire to expand our perceptions ... 

i hope some form of therapy or other listeners can be available for you ; it can be transformative to just be listened to. .. (some schools, jobs, or healthcares have a version which is available free and I’ve used it and it is super effective even if it’s not the best therapy out there it is SO good compared to none)

some people die of this deep suppression of self and no one ever knew they were suffering .  wonder if someone ever told them not to complain or their problems aren't significant

The best option then is become one of us who is working to heal it within and then spread that around. By helping others. ..
