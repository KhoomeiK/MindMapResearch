He welcomed the therapy with our new counselor who didnt just focus on ""don't do that,"" but on identifying what drove the compulsions.

My husband landed a fabulous new job with a huge pay raise and encouraged me to ""take a break."" I scaled down my business to almost nothing... And my income dropped accordingly.

For a few months, I reveled in life as an at-home mom, and worked on scaling up my non-profit. But the reality is, even scaling up my non-profit only takes up so much time. We invest in rental properties, so I took over management and a lot of the renovation work on those. It's a fun challenge, and while it isn't direct income, per say, it provides the revenue that we reinvest into the next property.

I'm currently in negotiations for a small retail property in which I'll also own a portion of the business that will move in. It wont be a full time job, but it's a challenge and will produce another long term revenue source.

Ask her to explain her stance rather than writing her off. If she tells you vaccines cause Autism, you're going to run into some challenges. If she tells you she's concerned about ""so many chemicals so quickly"" ask if she's open to an alternative vaccination schedule.

I historically have negative reactions to medicine. I wasn't sure if that would be hereditary and was concerned that if any vaccines caused a reaction, it would be difficult to isolewhich one it was.

I'll share my change-ups to my routine, plus some observations, then I have a question based on the wet hair pic at the bottom of my collage.

I had posted the picture on the left yesterday and complained that I couldn't maintain any curl clumps, that I spent an hour diffusing, followed by SIX HOURS of air drying and my hair was STILL wet. The picture on the right is from today after a changeup in my routine, 45 minutes of diffusing and about 90 minutes of air drying.

Today's Routine:I did a double shampoo with Suave Blue Clarifying Shampoo. (My hair was truly gross after yesterday, my normally super soft locks felt gritty, textured, and just...gross) After shampooing, I applied a doze of Hair Food's Smoothing Avocado and Argan Oil hair mask using praying hands, S2C until there were some clumps, twirled it up on top of my head, secured it with a clip and got out of the shower. I gave it 25 minutes while I was taking care of morning things, then hopped back in the shower to rinse it all out.

I conditioned with Tresemme Botanicals Coconut & (something?) and used S2C. Now, here's where I made a change... after S2C, I turned my hair upright and totally soaked it again, using my hands at my scalp to ""shake"" the water through and REALLY working to make sure I got all of the conditioners out. When I was confident as much as I could get out was out, I flipped upside down and ""squished"" until some clumps formed again. At that point, I applied about a quarter's worth of As I am Leave-in Conditioner using praying hands, then S2C to get my clumps back. (this is different, I had not yet tried a leave-in.)

At that point, I would have normally squished and squished and squished to get all the water out, before applying Shea Moisture Curl Cream, followed by gel... but at the advice of this forum, I put my upside-down head with some clumps under the water to get it soaked again, and kind of shook my head to get rid of some of the excess. I then immediately followed by applying about a lemon's worth of LA Looks Blue gel using praying hands method followed by squishing the clumps back in.

Now, I've been alternating between plopping (smushed my curls flat, touseling with a microfiber towel (broke up the clumps,) and using a microfiber turban twist (broke up the clumps) with no luck. I was GOING to try gently lifting my t-shirt up into the clumps, then had a brainstorm to open the shirt from the bottom, feed my hair INTO the shirt and do a super gentle lift and twist to secure the shirt AROUND my hair. I left it sort-of ""plopped"" like that for about 15 minutes while I got dressed.

One of the changes that made NO sense to me was the idea that I needed to start diffusing my hair when it was still sopping wet, with gel applied. That seemed counterproductive because wetter hair takes LONGER to dry. Apparently, that's not the case, because it took less than half the time to diffuse and air dry my soaking wet hair than it did my squished to dry hair. I don't get it, but I like less time and better curls.

Then I diffused for about 20 minutes upside down before gently switching to upright and diffusing by clustering sections into the diffuser, lifting it toward my head and alternating between warm and cold air. About 45 minutes in total. About 90 minutes after that, I was able to break the cast (still not a lot of cast, but way more than I've ever had before) and get the picture on the right.

Now, for those of you who hung in there, THANK YOU! My question is...I took the bottom picture in the shower. Whether I've just finished S2C, (but not rinsed), added my leave-in and squished, added my gel and squished...pretty much at any point where clumps come into play, I get the effect you see...of so many hairs just REFUSING to play well with others and having to hang out on their own. Does anyone have insight? Is this too much/too little protein? Is it just dry/damaged hair that still need time to suck up moisture? Is it a glycerin problem?

When you say ""always clarify,"" do you mean at every wash? I'm reading that wavies tend to need to clarify way more often than curlies...and there seems to be a lot of variation as to HOW often that means.

I am definitely going to try the LA Looks (on soaking wet hair) only on my next wash.

I don't believe I had damaged hair prior to starting this, but I could totally be wrong. I tend to think that either my Sept highlights (I'm SO grey) at a new salon did a lot of damage, or that I just haven't found the right products yet. I've emailed my salon to find out what brand of color they use.

I'll take a look at the products I'm using and see what potential problem ingredients show up. You make a great point about switching based on ingredients rather than products and getting the same issue with a different label. I hadn't considered that. Thank you!"

This time I t-shirt scrunched out some of the wet, THEN applied the curl cream followed by LA looks to wet, but not sopping wet hair. It's better than the above tries, but still not great.

I would believe that I may be agitating it through a squish dry. Or that I'm trying to get too much water out before diffusing it.

Other notes: This picture was taken on a day where I diffused for a full hour, then left it to air dry. Four hours of air drying and the clumps that do exist are still damp, so I can't scrunch the crunch.

Custody,f4pvwbq,t1_f4p4k0v,1571743807.0,"I'll also note, it sounds like you have gotten a raise and are frustrated that means you ex gets more. I understand that, I really do.

When I got remarried, my husband made six figures working a job with an hour long commute that required him to work out of state roughly 50% of the time. This wasn't a huge deal as a single dad because he had his son when he was in town, but could be on the road when he wasnt.

He took a new job when we got married that had a thirty minute commute and didnt require much travel. Same job, same level, but minus the travel and closer to our rural home. He also took a 40k paycut.

Guess who still had to pay child support as if he still make six figures? He paid more than double what I waa receiving for my two children. 

After FOUR years, the courts were willing to make an adjustment based on his new standard salary. By that point, she had gotten two massive promotions and made about 25k more per year than he did. Rather than go after her for child support, we made a mutual deal to drop ALL child support and to simply split medical expenses 50/50.

My ex made almost exactly the same income I did. However, he lives in another state and we have 70/30 split. He pays me child support. 40% of his payment goes into a college fund for the two kids. The rest goes in an account that I pull from for lessons, clothing, summer camp, medical expenses, etc.

Last year, I left my full time job to focus on working my non-profit. (I run a program that provides weekend food bags, hygiene and household products, a grocery pantry, etc for at-risk families in our district... Trust me, I see all sorts of fair and not fair.)

Me leaving, and my ex getting another promotion would likely mean that support would increase. However, I'm able to make that choice because I'm remarried and our household income is strong. I told my ex I would not only not request a review, but that I would bypass any review until the kids graduate in five years. In other words, what he pays is reasonable, it shouldnt go up because I took a risk to pursue my dream.

But all of that is based on people who aren't sqeaking by, who have reasonable interactions with their ex's, etc.

That's not always the case."
Custody,f4pu3us,t1_f4p4k0v,1571742909.0,"I'm not quite sure if you are missing the point or being deliberately obtuse. In either case, there's no call to be rude.

No one said YOU pay for two households. So let me try this one last time.

In many states, my own included, there is a calculated number that says ""it costs about X to raise a child."" THAT number assumes the child resides in one household with two parents. It logically follows that the combined income of those two parents are, more often than not, sharing the expenses for a singular residence.

So let's look at a prospective breakdown of costs being a single residence family and a duel residence family, and see how the overall money available for care shrinks dramatically in the split family scenario. 

The example being...(realistic numbers where I live, based on one child) 

Parent A earns 75,000/year (60%) 
Parent B earns 50,000/year (40%)
Combined Income: $125,000/ year

Estimated Yearly Cost for Child: $12,000
Calculated Parent A contribution:
$12,000 x 60% = $7,200
Calculated Parent B contribution: 
$12,000 x 40% = $4,800

This number assumes a 50/50 split of time, and would be further adjusted based on a different division of time, who provides health insurance, and who pays for child care.

In a world where the parents are together with a single residence, fixed monthly living expenses might be include:

Mortgage / Rent for 2-3 bed : $1000/mo
Homeowners Insurance: $60/mo
Combined Utilities: $350/mo
Property Taxes: $120/ mo
Household Upkeep (repairs, furniture) $200/mo

Now, in a duel household situarion, those costs are duplicated for each household with some variation JUST because the parents have separated, but the overall total combined income rarely increases JUST because the parents have separated. 

Therefore, each parent now has access to LESS money than they did as a couple because there are fixed expenses that can no longer be shared. 

That said, the amount of money needed to raise the child hasn't gone down. If anything, it has increased due to the increased expense of two homes. 

No one is saying there aren't better ways to do things. No one is saying the system isn't sometimes, or even often unfair. 

If you simply want to complain or rant, I can genuinely respect that, however, if you are truly trying to get an answer or understanding of a situation, it's generally more productive to be willing to modify your existing assumptions, hear people out, consider points you might not have thought of, and to stop insulting the people who decided to engage in conversation with you."

Custody,f4oxk7j,t1_f4o9cet,1571710708.0,"Two parents living in the same household only pay for a single household. Divorced/separated parents each have to pay for a residence and its associated costs.

The ""average price to raise a kid"" factors in household costs... You need a bigger home and have higher utilities, groceries, etc... It does not factor in TWO sets of household expenses.

Also, in most states, there is a calculated total expected cost to raise a child based on combined parental income. This figure is then divided based on who makes what. In theory, with equal income and 50/50 custody, I agree with you. But that isn't a super common circumstance, so the parent who earns more generally ends up paying more to help offset the costs of the other parent. I can't see why this wouldn't be viewed as reasonable."

Then I plopped into a soft tshirt for about fifteen minutes before letting it air dry. 

A few notes... 

It took a good twenty minutes of just trying to squish everything out, but I think I left WAY too much conditioner, because my hair is a tangled disaster today.

I washed at 5pm yesterday, my hair is STILL damp at 7:02 this morning. There is virtually nothing to crunch out of my hair. :(

My pre-CG routine:

I wash and condition with Aveeno Oatmeal blend, then use a leave in argan oil. I finger comb the conditioner in. I don't even own a comb or brush because my hair never tangles.

I generally wash at night, sleep on a towel, and have soft, wavy hair in the morning. I sometimes go out that way, but the waves fall out to ""touseled Beach look"" by midday and I get frizz from the humidity. So... I usually barrel roll it with a ceramic curling iron, which smooths it all out and gives nice body. I rarely use any more than a few sprays of Tressemee Flexible Hold hair spray on it. 

The lady I see at the Aveeno salon said I have some of the healthiest hair she's ever seen, but also said its some of the thickest. She said my scalp is a little dry, but not bad, but that my hair is very well hydrated.

I'm just so frustrated because it clumped gorgeous in the shower, but it's an absolute disaster this morning. As in, I'm going to have to take a shower and wash this all out before I can go out in public today."

But with that kindness came a genuine...disbelief that someone might not do the same, or worse, that someone wasn't obligated to do what he wanted in return. It wasn't so much Incel/Creepy Nice guy behavior, it was more a complete and utter lack of understanding about how healthy relationships worked.  


We had been friends for probably three or four years before we started dating and I knew the whole time he was interested but thought I was making it clear that I wasn't. What finally did it was that he up and decided to quit his job and move out of state because ""if I can't be with you, I can't even be around you, it's too much."" As a 22 year old, used to having him as my ""best friend,"" it was such an emotional gut punch to face losing the friendship, that I allowed myself to believe that the emotional impact must have meant I was in love with him and didn't realize it. In hindsight, I can totally see that whether he was smart enough to have orchestrated it that way or not, he emotionally manipulated me into dating him. We were married about 14 months later.  


The marriage wasn't terrible. That would be unfair. But it didn't take long to realize that his issues were part of a broader emotional stunted development that made a healthy marriage relationship impossible. He was passive-aggressive, did a lot of guilt-tripping, and really had no idea how to deal with kids when they came around. He didn't call me names, didn't physically abuse me, didn't financially abuse me. He simply slowly, but surely drained the joy and life out of me. Anything that took the attention away from him became a problem. It was a very slow, very subtle slide. I am a naturally outgoing, lively and vivacious person and was VERY accomplished and respected in my field. My work life and home life were like two very different people.  


About seven years in, a work colleague moved to the area from out of state. After a month or two of being around my husband and I, the friend pulled me aside and said it might not be their business, but they simply couldn't piece together the dramatic difference in ""work"" me and ""home"" me and asked if everything was ok. It was like someone shining a giant spotlight into this thing that always seemed like it wasn't a big enough deal to be a problem, but that was too big to ignore. My business partner started paying for my counseling, so I could go in secret. (My husband was totally against counseling.) My counselor was amazing and helped me really see things for what they were.   


I started working on healthier boundaries in the marriage and on being healthy as an individual. Unfortunately,  as I got healthier, he reacted more and more poorly, he discovered I was in counseling, refused to go with me, and ultimately had an almost complete and total breakdown one night during an argument. He cried, he yelled, he punched the wall, he accused me of bugging our house and of laughing at him with my counselor. It was the first time in my life I had ever feared for my safety. I did a full 180 to placate him, got him to bed, and after he went to work the next day, packed the kids, our dog and a few suitcases and bolted. My parents welcomed me with open arms and I learned for the first time that they had been hoping and praying I would walk away. Even his parents and siblings supported me. We attempted counseling and I waited a good seven or eight months before filing for divorce, hoping it might be salvaged. But...one person can't fix a broken relationship, especially if the other won't acknowledge the problems.   


Thankfully, he didn't fight the divorce, nor did he fight me moving two hours away to take a more secure job, or my eventual move out of state to get remarried. (The out of state move only added about 30 minutes each way to the drive.) He DID wake up some...becoming an infinitely more interested and attentive dad. I'm convinced he has a much better relationship with the kids than he would have if I'd stayed and as teenagers, my kids have a very healthy understanding of boundaries. We talk a lot about how to ""love someone around their problems."" They love him, and I'm glad they do. But they also are recognizing his challenges and learning how to be ""emotionally safe"" in how they interact with him.  


I don't regret the marriage, because my kids are amazing, and to be honest, the entire experience helped me grow into a far more empathetic, understanding, and emotionally healthy person than I likely would have become otherwise... BUT... I also fully recognize that things could have gone much, MUCH worse for me if he HAD turned out to be more overtly abusive, or my family hadn't been so supportive, or I hadn't had a healthy career and ability to provide for my kids on my own.   


Relationships should be built on mutual respect, trust, value for who someone is as a person, and shared life goals and commitments. Guilt, pity, or ""being worn down"" should NEVER factor into the equation.
