1. Times when I was too deep in ketosis - raised my carb intake to below 40 g/day (added more veg) I was having hypoglycaemic episodes during sleep that would wake me up. 

2. Dehydration and electrolytes off - added salt and ate more avocado for potassium.

2. As we get older, you won’t (and should not) ‘click’ or ‘spark’ with people in the same quantity as we did when we’re younger. In my early 20s it felt like every other guy had potential, and in my mid 30s it was like 1 in 10 or 15. That’s a great part of your 30s. You stop giving a shit what other people think of you (ie. who cares that they’re not into me, because I’m not really into them) and more often than not, you’ve dodged a bullet. 

3. This time sucks for everyone, and you’ve just made a huge life change. In my early 30s I found it helpful to take a decisive 6-month break from dating and sex. Meet guys but exclude sex and dating. Get to know people and see who sticks around (few do). It gave me back a sense of control when I felt like dating was controlling me (and my feelings). Your confidence will increase which will in turn, attract others.

Be kind to yourself - it will happen when the time is right and right now it probably isn’t, mostly for reasons outside your control. It’s temporary. Cat cuddles are way better than boy cuddles.

Edit:

PS - cats deserve a forever home if you decide to get one so please think about that. Fostering is another option that will help a kitty out :)"

I went to the ER once because I had chest pain. I’m on a medication to control my heart rate/rhythm and my cardiologist told me to go get checked out any time, and don’t worry about feeling like a hypochondriac when it comes to the heart. It was definitely not a panic attack. 

When the ER doc asked me what meds I’m on, I said I was on lamotrigine. He asked why, I said “for mood”. I never say “bipolar 2” because they treat you differently if you tell them outright that you have bipolar disorder when you’re there for a physical health complaint. 99% of physicians understand what it means, and it’s clear to them you’re not coming in for psychiatric reasons.

The ER doc proceeded to do a mental status exam asking if I had suicidal or homicidal thoughts without even listening to my heart or examining me. 

I froze. I had never felt such incredible shame and embarrassment in front of a healthcare professional. My face went red and I couldn’t think straight once I realized what was going on. My throat tightened. I felt unsafe. I told him I didn’t have those kinds of thoughts and that my chest pain had passed, even though it hadn’t, and I got up and left.

In any other professional context, I would have told him his line of questioning was completely inappropriate because it was clear I was not in psychiatric distress and that was not my presenting complaint, but I froze.
