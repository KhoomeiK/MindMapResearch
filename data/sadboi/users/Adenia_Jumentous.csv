The fact that none of that was explained to me gave me a really warped view of relationships for a long time, I thought that going NC was standard for everyone, that angrily ejecting people from your life was what everyone did. 

So my advice to you will stem from what I think might have helped me: Explain everything as kindly as you can. Support your wife's decision to go NC, do NOT fixate on ""there was no violence or sexual abuse"" - that is called *invalidation* and is a form of gaslighting. You're basically telling your children, and by extension your wife, that her abuse ""wasn't that bad"". 

Trauma is trauma, and abuse is abuse. 

And you're also wrong - a neglected child feels terror and feels a lot of danger. Yes, we know as adults that we were safe, but the damage to the nervous system is done. I strongly recommend you read a book called *The Body Keeps the Score*.

CPTSD,fqijlp2,t3_gj4med,1589396868.0,"I can't relate, but I understand. Your parents sound like they are codependent and now that you're gone - you were part of their emotional support system - they are now clingy. Stay strong and stay away, you are not responsible for their health and happiness."
CPTSD,fqijfnn,t3_gj55od,1589396803.0,"This sounds more like dopamine addiction to me, TBH. You're getting gratification from getting positive results and you're getting addicted to the surge. Don't get me wrong, it's great that you're getting positive experiences, but try not to indulge in the addictive nature."

CPTSD,fqi5alc,t3_gizh67,1589390366.0,"Yes, we can continue to deteriorate until we get help. I was ""fine"" throughout most of my twenties until I ended up in a toxic workplace and had an abusive spouse. My early 30's were way worse than anything in my late teens or twenties because of years of more trauma. 

First thing's first: separate yourself from all sources of trauma. Next thing: Seek therapy, read books, do the emotional labor. 

Once you acquire enough knowledge and skills and self-awareness you can correct your trajectory without continuing to get worse."
CPTSD,fqi505y,t3_gizjbd,1589390209.0,"ADHD is often a *symptom of trauma*, not necessarily the cause of it. Now, you might be abused by a parent or caregiver for expressing ADHD, which means it's a *vicious cycle*. Their abuse causes trauma and traumatized behavior, which provokes even more abuse and trauma. Such things are all too common, especially in narcissistic parents with anger issues."
CPTSD,fqi4tj6,t3_gizk41,1589390117.0,"My ex and I were both fight-types, but I was fight-freeze where she was just fight with fear of abandonment. She literally could not have any emotional conversation without yelling and attacking, and being a fight-type myself, I would attack back and eventually I would disengage (freeze) at which point she would panic and attack even more because of the fear of abandonment. It was the worst thing ever."
