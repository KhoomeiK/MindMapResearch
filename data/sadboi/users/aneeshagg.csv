antidepressants,fqozodj,t3_gk2b2i,1589529894.0,"I have been on wellbutrin xl 450mg since December 2019 and the same happened. After about 1.5 months I have become more depressed, anxious and very suicidal. I cant change my meds because of the lockdown and im suffering a lot. I am also on veniz xr 150mg, haloperidol 0.5 mg and lamitor 200mg. Im. Glad u r feeling better. Take care."
BPD,fqofy1d,t3_gjwy7t,1589514357.0,I feel the same. I feel like that will be my redemption. Maybe the feel who have hurt me will realise and feel guilty and my death will be worth it.
BPD,fqkinji,t1_fqj3dqy,1589428146.0,Exactly. I feel the same. Though i am not at peace anywhere. My family feels it's me who has adjustment issues and I should learn to be more mature I just feel suffocated everywhere. During my episode I also say I want to go home. BTW im 31/female.
BPDsupport,fpnx1os,t1_fpnhcdr,1588774301.0,Yes the lockdown is killing me. Home can be a little toxic owing to grandma and her nasty comments.

BPD,fp4qmvr,t3_gb0yxm,1588304995.0,"I feel it all stems from the abandonment issues we BPDs have. You always want to please your partner because you feel if u don't, they will leave you. It also stems from Low self esteem we all suffer from as we fear rejection the most. I guess you feel guilty and angry later because you feel powerless and that you succumbed to someone else's wishes and you feel that no one respects you. I feel the same in most situations. The guilt and anger also mean you are trying to hold on to the identity you created for yourself and yet it got shattered. There is a lot of self hatred and anger. But its not your fault. Im there for you buddy. You are perfect the way you are and don't judge yourself at all. It's our illness not us!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fong5ig,t1_fon69g3,1587918852.0,Thank you so so so much. Can i dm you?

BPD,fo5jy3w,t1_fo2ynui,1587527483.0,I feel the exact same and I can't take criticism from my family or friends too. Any disagreement feels like they hate me and I jus feel like cutting my hand.
BorderlinePDisorder,fo1tns0,t3_g4t00s,1587441259.0,Its gorgeous!!
BPD,fnzh40a,t1_fnzg1gj,1587393961.0,Its not medical. Advice. I just want to know what fellow survivors think of it as they have sufferes from similar issues and if yes how they dealt with it.
BPD,fnuqiuj,t1_fnsy3s4,1587268496.0,"What a lovely message. Im a fellow bpd survivor myself. Im 31, female. I feel you and do the exact same thing and am branded someone who over reacts and is dramatic all the time. It's jus sad."
