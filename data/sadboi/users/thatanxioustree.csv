BPD,fosv502,t1_fo78oko,1588038687.0,"Completely relating to this. Most of my worst time emotionally had happened when I have a FP. Always thought it might be because I had problems with dependency or something... I really hate it being  that way, because I start feeling bad more often and I feel I ruin the relationship with that or that my constant bad feelings makes the person go away. With is exactly what starts does feelings, the fear of losing them and also the constant thought of not being enough for them and don't deserving them. It's happening right now with my curren bf and quarantine isn't helping, I really hope I learn to control it I don't want to ruin this relationship with my feelings..."
