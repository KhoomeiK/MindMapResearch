EstrangedAdultChild,foj2c81,t3_g7pcmy,1587805581.0,"Hey there, firstly i just want to say im so sorry for what you're going through. You don't deserve any of that, its not your fault.
I completely relate to how you're feeling, bc im also the scapegoat and have two shitty siblings who don't give a crap about me and everyone treats me as less than human.
I left home 7 years ago and its a constant daily struggle, but it will get better i promise. Heres what ive learned in trying to heal from my toxic family. First, let yourself feel what you have to feel. Don't bottle it up. If you feel like curling up in the fetal position and crying, do it. So often the scapegoat is told that their feelings are invalid, and we hold onto that statement for years and try to suppress our emotions because of it. Dont do that, your feelings are valid, and by letting yourself cry/scream/etc you're letting go of that toxic belief. Dont treat yourself the way that they treated you. Your feelings are valid, so let yourself feel them.
Treat yourself as you would treat a friend. If a negative thought about yourself comes into your head, ask yourself ""would i say this about a friend in a similar situation?"" Probably not. You deserve to be treated the same as everyone else. Self love is the most important thing you can do to heal. You deserve the same love as everyone else, so give it to yourself.
As far as the lack of apologies go, ohhhhh boy ive been there. It fucking sucks and feels like you can't move on. It would be so much easier to get closure if they've apologized, but take it from me and the hundreds of other people on this sub, they will probably never apologize. Which means you need to get that closure on your own, which is harder but it's the only option you have and trust me its worth it. Accept that they're never going to change and that they were wrong for how they treated you. You don't need external validation to know in your heart what is right and wrong. For getting closure, id strongly suggest therapy and journaling. Or write yourself the apology letter you wish your sisters would give to you. Its like tricking your brain into thinking you got an apology.
You don't have to be NC with everyone, from your story it sounds like NC is essential with your sisters though. You could just remain low contact with your dad. If you ever feel like contacting them again, make a list of all the shitty things they said and did that made you get to this point.
Also, if you ever need to vent or talk about anything, send me a message seriously i know how hard this situation is, it fucking sucks but you're not alone"

LifeAfterNarcissism,fof3tru,t3_g6ddr6,1587725035.0,"ah dude i feel the same way. for me the narcissists are my siblings, i was the scapegoat of the family. i definitely miss them and had a spurt the other day thinking ""maybe i'll just check in on my sister"" because she's not as bad as my brother. i tried contacting her because she told everyone that she misses me and wishes i'd reach out to her. welll she completely ignored me, i left her a voicemail saying that i wished she didnt tell everyone she wanted me to call her if she was just going to ignore me because it seems very two-faced. she told my mom i left her a mean voicemail and that she isn't ready to talk to me now. she always does this sort of thing, tries to act like the victim then when i do reach out,she acts passive aggressive to me and tries to paint me as the villain. my sister also told everyone that i gave myself ptsd, and sides with my abusive stepdad. i guess the point that im trying to make with this story, is that even though you get spurts where you want to contact, play the actual scenario out in your head. imagine yourself actually checking in on that person, you know them well enough so what would they say? how would that go down?  if you're a member of this group, then it probably wont go down well. replaying that imaginary scenario in your head can make your brain feel as though you actually reached out to them while keeping a safe distance; and will remind you why you cut them off to begin with.

getting_over_it,fo2k18p,t3_g5am5y,1587465360.0,"ah man i've been there, it's been 7 years since i moved out of my abusive home and i'm definitely in a much better spot than where i was, and objectively from the outside my life looks great but sometimes i still get sucked into my shitty past. it's definitely not as bad as it used to be, i still struggle with ruminating thoughts but not nearly as much as before  
what i would recommend, based on my own experience dealing with trying to get over the past, is to let yourself feel what you need to feel. if you're feeling sad and angry, don't tell yourself ""i need to just get over this"" and ignore the emotions.  if you do that, then you're invalidating yourself just like your parents and bullies did, and that will only make the negative emotions grow stronger.  don't treat yourself the way those abusive bullies treated you, because you don't deserve that you deserve kindness.  sit with your emotions, let yourself feel the sadness and anger, accept that you feel bad and give yourself kindness.  talk to yourself the same way you would talk to a friend who was traumatized.  


another thing i would recommend is cognitive behavioral therapy.  here are some useful links to get started:  
 [https://www.healthline.com/health/cbt-techniques](https://www.healthline.com/health/cbt-techniques)   
 [https://positivepsychology.com/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-techniques-worksheets/](https://positivepsychology.com/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-techniques-worksheets/) 

i would also recommend EMDR therapy.  EMDR has been proven to be incredibly powerful in overcoming trauma, several of my friends have done it and feel a thousand times better.  i'm starting my first EMDR session this week.  


Meditation also works really well.  something i do every morning, i wake up, sit on the side of my bed, and do deep breathing exercises for 10 minutes.  i inhale deeply for 5 seconds, hold it, then slowly let it out for 5 seconds.  
If you're feeling overwhelmed with emotions at school or work and you need to focus, doing the above breathing exercise really helps.  When you focus your attention on your breathing, it makes your brain pay attention to your physical actions and draws it away from the negative thoughts. plus, breathing exercises like that reset your nervous system and naturally make you less anxious.  
doing math problems or any other sort of math/science related task also helps distract you and puts your mind in a more logical mindset.  so if im ever at work and i really need to focus on something but im distracted by ruminating thoughts, i start doing long division problems in my notebook.

Estrangedsiblings,fnkyhmt,t3_fwzmy7,1587043121.0,"hey, i just found this subreddit and your post was the first one i saw.  i just want to say, i'm so sorry for your pain.  i'm also estranged from my brother, and i miss him so much even though he's hurt me more than anybody else in my life has the past few years and i was even suicidal because of the things he said and did to me. when i try talking to him, he's only willing to reconcile if i take the blame for everything, saying he did nothing wrong.  i haven't been a perfect person either, i reacted badly to some of the things he said and did, but i apologized for my poor reaction and he never apologized for hurting me in the first place and thinks he doesn't need to.  i miss my brother, but i know my worth, and you should never ever have to compromise your value to win someone else's love.  i don't know your brother, but based on what you said about him in your post it sounds like he thinks its okay to treat you like shit and you should just put up with it. its horrible that you can see the good in someone so bad, but they only see the bad in someone so good.  don't let him villainize you, you deserve better.  again, im so sorry that you're going through this. if you ever want to vent about this to me, feel free to send me a PM"

Hes done some really shitty things to me the past few years, such as siding with my abusive stepdad and saying that i gave myself ptsd, not my abusive stepdad. He's also friends with a pervert former teacher of ours who not only made a pass at me, but literally dozens of girls and was fired for it. My brother said ""its not like he raped you"" and ""im allowed to have my own relationships"". I told him i wont speak to him until he apologizes for hurting me, he said he wont apologize bc he did nothing wrong and im ""manipulative"" for expecting an apology. Its been nearly 4 years and i miss my brother but he obviously doesn't miss or care about me, he used to make me feel like i deserved to be treated like shit and i honestly had suicidal thoughts bc of him.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fj074qb,t1_fiyoca0,1582891667.0,"yeah i specifically have C-PTSD.  generally speaking, PTSD comes from a single traumatic event (like soldiers experiencing a traumatic battle, someone getting raped, having a very close loved one die suddenly) while C-PTSD is from living in constant trauma, like kidnap victims have C-PTSD and victims of child abuse.  Both PTSD and C-PTSD can occur from not just physical abuse, but also emotional, mental, and verbal abuse.  Most psychologists say that emotional abuse is just as bad, if not worse, than physical abuse, and many people who grew up in physically and emotionally abusive households say that the emotional abuse was worse.  Don't underestimate emotional abuse, just because you can't see it doesn't mean its not there.  It can literally change your brain structure, so there is actually something physical going on"

It's so hard to figure out whether or not protecting someone is the right choice because sometimes we should be exposed to a bit of pain to help us through life, but I think you did the right thing by protecting your brother.  He might have ended up with addiction issues anyways, as a coping mechanism for being abused.  You're a good sibling and a good person, you did the best you could"

After finding these emails, I have such a weird mix of emotion.  I'm relieved because I know that I'm not crazy and the pain I've been feeling is valid, I have a higher sense of self esteem, and I feel less sad but more angry.  Angry at my entire family for gaslighting me as a way to excuse their shittiness, angry at my adult self for doubting that young girl inside of me screaming for help for so many years.  I can't believe I let my toxic family influence the way I treated her, as they have influenced so many other people.  Never again will I doubt her"

My life is a lot more successful than other people in my family, I moved abroad and the distance helped me cope and form new healthy relationships and habits without them.

I really want to have kids one day, and I don't want my stepdad or siblings to have anything to do with them.  I'm worried they might try to crawl into my kids lives via my mom or finding them online when they're older (I'm worrying about something that won't have the chance to happen for at least 10 years lol), people in my family are very good at painting themselves as the victim while convincing everyone else that I'm a liar.

Because of constantly being belittled, I felt like I had to prove my worth so I grew up into a perfectionist and made sure that I would never have to rely on any parents once I turned 18. As a result I am the most well-off and only financially independent one out of my siblings but I also have horrible anxiety all the time and trouble sleeping from constant nightmares lol. My cousins told me that whenever people mention me at family get-togethers, like ""I heard VulcanHumour is doing this-and-that, that's so cool!"" he tries to belittle my accomplishments to them by telling them that I'm crazy and all the cops in town know me.  The cops in town do know me...because he used to call them over to our house to try to scare me when I would call him out on his racist ranting/bullying/etc and tell me ""I'm calling the cops to kick you out of MY house, I own this place not you or your mom"". But I was a teenager he couldn't kick me out so the cops would just stand there awkwardly and leave.
