I like a few Nicki Minaj tracks but I think her tracks take me away from God. Our brains are sponges. To what extent does what we put in our heads affect us? I don’t know, but I think it says something that lyrics and instrumentation not only impact our mood but also cause us to reflect on certain material. I’ve noticed that Nicki’s tracks make it seem fun to objectify people and get revenge.

Billie Marten’s song “Milk and Honey” affects my mood and my thoughts but it doesn’t objectify anyone and glamorize toxic behaviors. It’s about a  girl who’s pouring all her affection into someone who consistently ignores her. This is something many can relate to.

We all have inherent worth and are lovable and reflections of something greater. However, I do a lot of reading and watching videos about these topics because I’m fascinated by relationships, neurochemical processes that go on during sex and how these processes affect us, and more. I hear a lot of stories about how people, especially women, feel like sex is the currency for love. 

However, there are a lot of women who make it known they’re okay with sex with no strings attached. This can set a new bar for us women to meet. I very much believe heterosexual/bisexual women also objectify men but that it’s less noticeable. Men also receive the stereotype of only caring about sex, which isn’t true, but sex is pretty much part of everything in our society. Our world has a weird relationship with sex.

There are numerous psychology research articles (actual research articles- not just Psychology Today ones) that hint that there is a problem in the way many of us view sex, just as it’s more evident that there is a huge problem in the way we reduce people to their accomplishments.

However, for my behavioral pharmacology class last semester, I wrote a paper about what we can learn and how we can benefit from studying drugs that induce a process similar to the one that occurs during near-death experiences, e.g. ketamine and classic psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, and DMT). I really loved writing that paper and psilocybin stood out in terms of its long-lasting positive benefits in one study that was done with cancer patients and then in another study done with people who'd never been exposed to hallucinogens:

Stealing from my paper to elaborate: ""The participants were either administered a very low dose of psilocybin or high dose of psilocybin during the first session and then after five weeks, given the alternative. A six month follow-up revealed that 80% of the participants continued to show clinically significant decrease in anxiety/depression, and greater than 80% of the participants showed moderately or greater increased well-being/life-satisfaction. Improvements about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality were attributed to the high dose of psilocybin. In another study involving psilocybin, hallucinogen-naive adults-53% participating regularly in religious or spiritual activities-, thirty adults were administered-in one session-30 mg oral psilocybin and-in another session-40 mg oral methylphenidate hydrochloride in a counterbalanced order (Griffiths et al., 2008). There was a two month wait between sessions. Six additional participants had a third session, being administered methylphenidate in the first two sessions and psilocybin in the third. A fourteen-month follow-up after the last session revealed that participants believed the experience had substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and that the participants had sustained positive changes in attitudes and behaviors (Griffiths et al., 2008). Their responses were consistent with community observer ratings.""

Psilocybin sounds friendly. Ketamine was a bit...creepy compared to DMT (DMT at least sounded pretty...I think it's tamer in ayahuasca.)

DMT- ""DMT is a natural substance produced by the body in small amounts but is also produced in plants or synthesized (Potts, 2012). DMT administered to study participants has resulted in participants recollecting visual hallucinations like “beautiful, colorful pink cobwebs” and projected “complex geometric patterns” and “body parts” (Potts, 2012). It has also resulted in feelings of “euphoria” (Potts, 2012).""

DMT vs. ketamine: ""Like ketamine, DMT perhaps plays a role in protecting neurons during circumstances like hypoxia (Potts, 2012). A study that compared the effects of ketamine and DMT on nine participants revealed that both drugs shared the ability to induce body misperceptions and-at high doses-paranoia and a “‘sense of altered meaning or significance’” (Potts, 2012). During this study, it was ketamine that resulted in the most unpleasant symptoms: “dose dependent hypomimia, psychomotor poverty, poverty of speech, apathy and withdrawal,” and “catatonic-like behavior,” this unpleasantness causing researchers to further question ketamine’s role in NDEs.  As has been done with ketamine, some researchers have attributed the cause of NDEs to solely DMT, but NDEs arise in a variety of conditions and it is possible that more than one neuroprocess is involved (Potts, 2012). ""

Haha.

If I get blessed to go to grad school for clinical psychology, I'd love to explore this topic in greater detail, especially psilocybin. It sounds wonderful to incorporate in therapy sessions and psychedelics in general seem to be more on the ""connectedness"" end and aren't known to be addictive. I see it as a car needing a push up a hill.

Many people don't know how to moderate and this shows even in our relationship with food and social media. We're also not really taught how to analyze the extent to which something contributes to or takes away from our ability to appreciate being in the moment without access to it. Knowledge really is power. The more knowledge we have and the more we're made aware of our inherent worth and connectedness, the more empowered we are to make decisions that reflect that in how we treat ourselves and how we treat others."
