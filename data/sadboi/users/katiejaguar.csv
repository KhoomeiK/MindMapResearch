If you have a diagnosed mental illness, there are a lot of options through Partner Resources that can help protect you and your job if you‚Äôre having to call out often bc of your mental illness. One is whats called a ‚Äúflexible leave of absence‚Äù i think, where you let them know that sometimes you can‚Äôt make it into work and those days become leave of absence days and your manager can‚Äôt say no or retaliate against you.
Another is called a ‚Äúreasonable accommodation‚Äù. If there are certain things that trigger you, make you feel worse, or anything like that, you can apply for an accommodation. The example my DM used was that an older barista had a bad back, and her reasonable accommodation was that she didn‚Äôt do heavy lifting, or get down to clean the drains.
I really really hope you‚Äôre okay. Pm me anytime u need anything."
