I guess you could say this observation is scientific, in which case you have reached a dead end. You would have to reconcile yours and their understanding of truth and objective reality.

If they wish to argue that science does not result in “absolute truth”, theyd be correct. However this “absolute truth” is indistinguishable from the tentative truth science can find, and is mostly if not totally useless to us as humans. If they have a method for absolute truth, they should have no issue demonstrating this."

Socialism_101,fqixhwx,t1_fqivjnp,1589402220.0,"What Ive been brainstorming about lately is this:

For example we have in America atleast and a fairly decent understanding in the west overall of the separation of church and state. Not always enforced but I think modeling after that we need a separation of business and state, which would include but is not limited to banning corporate lobbying and such. An amendment in the constitution that clearly defines the role of businesses and constructs a wall between it and the state. That could help protect social democracy maybe.

For any ML state there needs to be a bill of rights that defines civil liberties, but is able to find some sort of sensible line where counter revolutionary activity can be cracked down on. Keep in mind, after the US revolution, Shays rebellion was an example of counter revolutionary activity of the newly formed state, so some sort of balance appears achievable. Not only that “counter terrorism” is an excuse to forgo civil liberties, and *maybe* its a good one sometimes, counter revolutionary measures would be to, there just needs to be a public sentiment of the importance of it. There also needs to be a mechanism of checks and balances and a mechanism to weed out corruption and bureaucratic waste

Another thing is how we perceive and critique authoritarianism and liberty needs to change. The conflation of the hammer and sickle with the swastika is nonsensical. The state abolishing slavery was a top down, authoritarian measure, yet that would be perceived as an act of liberty, yet coercively abolishing the private ownership of the MoP is perceived as red fash, and further yet the state enforcing private ownership of the MoP is liberty?? That doesnt add up at all"
