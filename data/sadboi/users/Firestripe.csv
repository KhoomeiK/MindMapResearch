BPD,fqa7wxc,t3_ghibu2,1589214396.0,"I’m an Indian-American woman, so I feel this too. I also live in a predominantly white area. It’s hard to say how scary it is to be in these spaces and not feel judged by appearances from complete strangers. Especially now that I have to wear a mask everywhere, I can’t smile and show that I’m not threatening. But I have been met with kindness and empathy by some really great friends. They make me feel like there are really good people in the world. I hope that’s encouraging."

BPD,fp9d4fo,t1_fp8dp8c,1588422822.0,Thank you very much! :)
BPD,fp0okdl,t1_fp0gqc6,1588213507.0,What if you made it kind of a series instead of one long post?

I love this. Thank you for that"
BPD,fo73xir,t1_fo728mj,1587571814.0,"Well, let's see. I'm also new to my diagnosis, so I'm trying to understand everything.   
He's a friend of mine, not any kind of romantic relationship. He's married and has kids, so that factors into how much he can really be available to me. He's more of a mentor than anything else. He listens to my craziness and offers advice sometimes. He's the only person I've told about my BPD diagnosis, and the only person I probably will tell. I haven't told him he's m FP and probably won't. 

In my head I rely on him for everything and need to have his validation. When he doesn't respond, I feel like he hates me and wants nothing to do with me. But he has repeatedly told me that that's not true. He says that sometimes he doesn't have the mental space (given having a wife and kids) and that he'd like to respond well. So I have to respect that. I feel like we have good boundaries. The biggest thing is that my mental stability relies on whether or not he's responding to my texts. I texted him last night and haven't heard from him and I can't stop thinking about it, or whether I should text him again and hope he'll respond. I get really anxious and can't think about anything else. There's probably more too. 

What's it like with yours?"
BPD,fo714gd,t3_g61tyd,1587570399.0,I have the same questions. Especially your last one. I have a favorite person and I also need some perspective.
mentalillness,fo6tq9q,t3_g5u81m,1587566555.0,Yep. I keep my noise cancelling headphones nearby for quiet. And I listen to quiet music. It’s the only thing that helps. Otherwise I feel intense anger like I’m boiling inside and could erupt at any moment.
Christian,fnxyyyp,t3_g4aom9,1587349449.0,"Like so many people here have already said, I think checking out an online church nearby is a good first step. My church just planted a new church whose first sermon was supposed to be in a school, ended up being online. So all of our small groups are done via Zoom. None of us knew each other, and we only know each other through zoom. But it’s one way we can connect. Then once quarantine is over, we can finally meet in person. You can reach out to the pastors after you’ve watched their sermon, usually they’ll have some way to do that. You can meet them digitally, then once gatherings open up again you’ll have people you can meet in person. I hope that helps."
bipolar,fnxmnk8,t1_fnxjyzt,1587341844.0,"Oh my goodness yes. I’m also terrified of saying too much and getting locked away! It’s good though that he asks you about therapy. That’s too bad about the rash. :( I’ve been on lamotrigene since I was first diagnosed with bipolar. I think the dose I’m on now finally helps. How do you feel about getting back on meds? I can’t imagine my life without them. 

By unreal I think I mean my behavior and the trauma that I’ve experienced, never putting the two together. I go through intense bouts of anger that last a few hours. That’s usually based on something that someone has said or done. That’s the biggest thing that’s concerning me atm. Also there’s this “favorite person” thing where I rely on this one person all the time for everything and if I don’t hear from him I go crazy. I think about him all the time. But not in a romantic way. Just the need for communication with only him. Then there’s the feeling like I don’t know who I am. The impulsivity. My mood swings are extreme but much shorter than bipolar extremes. Although I have those too. And psychosis. It’s a whirlwind. I feel disassociated from my own life. Like it’s not me that’s experiencing any of it."
bipolar,fnxhlj5,t1_fnxg7tp,1587338793.0,"Well my therapist isn’t the most mature. She’s an intern. Mines the opposite story. She hasn’t diagnosed me with anything but backs up my psych. I think I’m still kind of spiraling. I’ve been researching and been here on reddit and the mighty connecting with people. But also in a way I feel more at peace. I feel hope that I can manage better with the right treatment. I read over my journal and I see so many flags that indicate BPD. A lot of my life now feels unreal. And weird and I don’t know what to think. 

How does your psychiatrist appointment usually go? Do they ask how meds are working or ask things like a therapist would? That’s what my psychiatrist does. I hope your appointment goes well! It’s sometimes scary for me."
bipolar,fnxe5ha,t3_g3sw15,1587336789.0,Yes. Just last week my new psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD in addition to my bipolar 2 diagnosis. it was definitely shocking. but learning about the symptoms it makes so much more sense. Kind of surprised that none of my other providers ever noticed. My therapist told me that she would’ve noticed if it was really bad. But when we talked about BPD she had to look it up in the DSM to even know what the symptoms were. Sooo I think I’m going to find a new therapist. The right diagnosis takes time from my understanding.
bipolar,fnwoyhr,t3_g4cli7,1587322578.0,Me either. It’s ominous.
BPD,fnvuovz,t3_g40cl3,1587305190.0,"Kind of came out of nowhere for me. My psychiatrist recommended me to her higher-up psych who ended up diagnosing me. She asked me questions about my relationships which were all in some way abusive. And the nature of my anger. As well as several other things. She put the pieces together pretty quickly and gave me the diagnosis. I had been diagnosed as bipolar for 5-6 years. After talking to her I realized how so much about BPD makes more sense. And after reading so many posts here, I can relate to soooo much. BPD explains a lot about why I act the way that I do. I don’t know if she still has the bipolar diagnosis for me. But I think for me personally it doesn’t really matter at this point. A lot of the treatment is the same. She’ll probably change some of my meds, and I’ll start DBT."
BPD,fnunejd,t3_g404as,1587266281.0,"It’s definitely ok to not be ok. You’re human, right?"
BPD,fnumfyw,t3_g3wsh9,1587265611.0,Man. It used to be pretty bad for me when I was younger. Used to break things. Holes in walls. One time on a rage I practically stomped through the floor from a second floor apartment. Didn’t break but if I were any heavier it might have. Later I got into to Muay Thai and got my rage out that way. Finally got on mood stabilizers which has calmed me down significantly. Now I sort of zone out in rage but don’t act on anything. I only think the thoughts. Sometimes I yell but not as often. The meds and therapy really help me.
BPD,fnulkek,t3_g3unr0,1587265010.0,"I’m with you on that. I don’t like making new friends because I’m afraid they’ll think I’m too clingy, crazy, or a downer.  I have this one friend that is super supportive, but he even tells me I need to find other friends to talk to which makes me feel like he doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. When he’s repeatedly told me that’s not the case. I need to have trusting friends. But a lot of people just want to make small talk for their entire friendships. Some people don’t understand mental illness so I end up pretending there’s nothing wrong with me. Then start questioning myself if I’m making it all up. Then start hating myself. Then can’t make friends again. It’s exhausting."
