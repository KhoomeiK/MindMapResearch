Mcat,fnx2um8,t1_fnx1ya3,1587330384.0,"How so? I’m not trying to troll, I really don’t get it."
Mcat,fnx077u,t3_g4be4c,1587328912.0,So is this implying that the AAMC followed what we wanted but thought they messed up?
Mcat,fntrlhy,t1_fnthfs7,1587247361.0,Well said!
Mcat,fnto64g,t1_fntafxy,1587245589.0,"Of course everything isn’t about privilege, but it has such a vital role in getting into med school. I can remember being a pre-med student and not having any support to achieve my goal. And one of those supports was a safe place to study! The life I lived prior to college, did not provide me with the support and knowledge it took to conquer a challenge like the MCAT. I’m better now but it took a long time to get the basics down.  So many do not become doctors not because they weren’t smart enough, but because they lacked the structure and support it takes to get there. Seeing this study set up made me think of this, maybe I should have held back and not commented, but that doesn’t change the component privilege plays here."
Mcat,fnt4hkx,t3_g3po7k,1587234445.0,The privilege is oozing out of this.
Mcat,fno09xj,t3_g1judv,1587107457.0,What does FL mean? Also congrats on your score!
depression,fng1ib5,t1_fng0xpm,1586920134.0,This need to comment has come out over the last couple of months.I used to fear commenting (still kind of do) but the impulse wins. In a way I feel that the impulse is trying to make me better person by seeking information and clarity.
Advice,fnb10w8,t1_fnanvrp,1586807343.0,Thank you this helps! Next time we will not disturb the nest and will be leaving this one alone in hopes the mother comes back.  When you say incubated do mean the mother sitting on the eggs?
