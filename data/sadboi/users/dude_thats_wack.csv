Anxiety,fef9k6e,t3_eouu4o,1579051392.0,"Medications are a divisive subject. Some people get the most out of being on meds, but others (like me) function better without. I have GAD and anxiety medication would do me no good.  
My only advice is probably not what you'd want, but it's the only one I can give. Be honest with your psychiatrist and voice your concerns about medication not helping. See if you can figure out alternative ways to cope, and work with your mental health.  
Treatment is going to be wonky. You'll take two steps forwards and one step back, at times. Some days you'll have to grit your teeth and force yourself through what seems to be the impossible, but it's all a part of getting better.  
I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I know that you'll be okay :) Take care of yourself <3"

Or find something to occupy your hands with, start carrying around a notebook and a pencil and just make tiny scribbles, or get one of those fidget cubes. Good luck :)"
Anxiety,fea3qjc,t3_eo8syw,1578944053.0,"Maybe it's because physical exercise gives you similar feelings to panic attacks?

Like a faster heartbeat, sweating and heavy breathing. If you're not used to exercise, and push yourself much, the feelings that come with remind your body of a panic attack, which in turn triggers a panic attack.

Basically ""Hey this feels like that bad thing... is it that bad thing?? Better do the bad thing""

This happened to me in P.E in school. My friends made fun of me because I was just ""lazy"", when in reality the normal feeling of exhaustion would trigger a panic attack. But alternatives to exercise can be simple things like going for a walk, maybe a short jog?

At least that's my 2 cents"
Anxiety,fe5up86,t3_enw0o7,1578875364.0,"\[Mild Self-harm warning\]  
I can't speak for others, but for me it is very normal. I described it to my therapist as something that makes me feel like I have the control over. Other things such as pulling my hair, hitting my head, etc. are also things I do.  
During a panic attack, the feeling of being helpless makes me panic even more. Because I can't grasp control over my body's sensation or my own thoughts. My automatic go-to is then to give myself a physical sensation that makes sense, if you get me."
Anxiety,fdt7beq,t1_fdt65t3,1578712866.0,"Don't apologize, love! It's alright, being anxious does that to ya :) Sometimes putting yourself a bit ahead of others is important. You can't mend relationships if you yourself is entirely broken. Me and my mum had to clash a bit before we got a stronger relationship. Countless nights of me sobbing and her getting upset and frustrated, where it felt like everything said was just ignored or brushed aside. It's all scary but things get better.  
Make a plan. Write down what you want to say on a note, and read it out loud. Text her, send her an email or a letter. Countless opportunities, find the choice that helps you achieve your goal :) It really does get better, I promise you."
Anxiety,fdt4uuw,t3_en174f,1578711942.0,"Hey, it's gonna be okay <3  
I was in a similar situation. When I first started therapy, I was in there with both of my parents. At the time our relationship was very strained, because I couldn't communicate my issues to them in a good way, which lead to a lot of confusion and frustration on their part.  
After a year or so, I started therapy again. I told my parents that I didn't want them in there. I told them that I couldn't tell them what they wanted to know, because I didn't know what they wanted.  
My advice is; if your mother is someone who tries to be understanding, but has a tendency to want to be aware of the situation, just tell her straight out. Just tell her ""I want to speak to the therapist alone. I don't know how to say things to you or around you, so I need to do this on my own.""  
However if you don't think your mother is this kind of person, then mention it in the room with the therapist as well. When you sit down to chat, ask if you can talk to them alone. Most likely your therapist will support that decision, and help keep your mother from smothering your choices. Just take the scary leap and be honest :)  


If you're worried about other mental issues that you'd like to get checked for, then I'm pretty sure that is something you can bring up to your therapist. I'm not sure where you're from, but where I'm from I was able to talk to my therapist about my thinking I have aspergers. We spoke about it, and agreed that if I'm worried then we'll get me assessed.  
Take care of yourself :) You'll be okay <3"
Anxiety,fdt3725,t3_en1an4,1578711325.0,"Don't worry, this doesn't sound stupid at all :)  
Are you seeing a therapist? I know it's scary, but talking to a professional about this helps ease worries.  
What you're describing doesn't sound like anything dangerous. My head tends to go all wonky if I've sat down for a long time, and I stand up and move around. If you feel convinced that your body isn't doing ""good body things"" then go see a doctor, and soothe your mind :)  
If you're feeling scared of your changed view on death/suicide, please talk to someone about it. Seeking help sometimes feels like staring death in the face, and it's terrifying. But it can do so much good for you!  
2020 will be the year you get on the path to getting better, I believe in you <3 Stay safe and take care :)"
