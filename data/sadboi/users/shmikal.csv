akalimains,erexa09,t1_erex17e,1560794999.0,"i think that shes been unbuffed for too long tbh, and that riot is just afraid of community backlash from people who dont play her and dont know how to counterplay her, which quite honestly is sad given the age of akali outstanding most of if not all of the other champions in the game, and its a real big shame too that a lot of people within the akali community have been consistently demanding reverts and reworks when in reality this version of akali is probably one of the best shes seen in ages, although of course the nostalgia proves that the old version was still hella fun and I dont deny that at all"
akalimains,erelb5c,t1_erekx27,1560786943.0,"imo i think that the w nerf that is proposed is fine, as it means that people will have a fair and balanced window to trade into her when it is off cd, despite whether or not it is true stealth. The way that akali is she is highly sustained and extended damage, and the true stealth is essentially a way of making sure that she doesnt look like an idiot running around to proc her passive, as she would be killed in -3 seconds. However, the turret change was defiently good. 

Furthermore, i think that her e should stay more of a utility spell, even if it gets buffed, as it is not her primary source of damage, that's her passive and her e should simply be a way of proc'ing that, as well as being a sort of shadow of her old r with the way that it locks on to the target. 

I think that also adding to the idea of creating a unique champion, her other skills simply cannot compete with her shroud, as that spell (alongside her healing rip) has been a part of her identity since launch, and at her current state with her current passive and playstyle, removing true stealth may in fact severely damage the champion - obviously keeping the turret change because that was a little extreme."
