I used to take a drug called Viibryd. It caused horrible dependence, but had no addictive or habit-forming properties. As a result, I would frequently experience withdrawal.

I don't know anything about your boyfriend or your relationship, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But I can  say that other people don't decide what you can or cannot do.

explainlikeimfive,f05akgf,t3_d3tyfn,1568405520.0,"It's true that beer is mostly water, and the alcohol content of beer is substantially lower than other alcoholic beverages. It's also true that our bodies are well equipped to process many toxins in small doses. Most healthy adults won't get sick from swallowing an apple seed (cyanide!), brushing their teeth (fluoride!), or drinking from the tap (God only knows). Alcohol is no different, except that we tend to seek it out, and in large quantities.

However, alcohol doesn't just deplete you of water. It changes the way that your body processes water. When you drink alcohol, even in the small amounts found in beer, you're depleting your body of an important chemical known as vasopressin.

Vasopressin is a hormone. Not *that* kind of hormone, so don't get too excited. A hormone is simply a chemical that tells one or more parts of your body what to do. Just like testosterone tells your muscles to get big and your brain to get small, other  hormones have a message for your body, too.

Vasopressin, while not exactly a household name like testosterone, plays an important role in hydration. After your kidneys filter toxins from the liquids, what's left is clean, life-sustaining water. Your body needs that water back, and Vasopressin is there to remind your kidneys of that. With normal levels of vasopressin, your body doesn't need a constant intake of water, because it can reabsorb what it already has once your kidneys have cleaned it.

But when you drink alcohol, you lose vasopressin. Without vasopressin, no one is there to tell your kidneys what to do with all the clean water they made, so they just dump it. This includes the roughly 12 ounces of ""water"" that you just drank because you were ""thirsty.""

So, it turns out that you can't offset the harmful effects of alcohol with the beneficial effects of water. While a drink or two won't hurt you, it's not gonna help much, either.

Not that you shouldn't enjoy that glass of water before bed that you think will magically prevent a hangover, of course. But without vasopressin, that water will get the same amount of respect from your vital organs as a shot of vodka. That is to say, not very much.

EDIT: Sorry, I thought I was in ""Explain Like I'm 21."""
raisedbynarcissists,f04ulg8,t3_d3kxk2,1568395982.0,"This makes me feel a little thankful that my family was *weird.* I grew up unschooled on a small reptile farm, with a hoarder mom and a slightly autistic dad. Household income was rarely over $18,000. They were convinced that God had ""set them apart"" for a special purpose, which involved isolating their children.

I *still* have trouble explaining, or even understanding, how I ended up with PTSD from this. But at least I don't have the facade of normalcy to contend with.

I didn't notice any errors, by the way. Also ""unschooling"" is probably not a concept Ukrainians are subjected to. It's basically homeschooling without the schooling."
