depression,ffmpdbi,t3_enrs4c,1580057508.0,"I struggle with this everyday. I’m an actress so people automatically think I’m overdramatic. So every time I want to open up to someone, I think people are gonna think that. I don’t want to seem crazy and I basically convince myself that I’m overreacting so I just crawl deeper into myself."
AnorexiaNervosa,ff539pw,t3_erfxkz,1579579038.0,I am the same way. My weight is down but I feel so fat and hate to see pictures of myself. I don’t want anyone else seeing it either.

AnorexiaNervosa,f7vyctp,t3_dxktxt,1574028188.0,"My parents went through a pretty nasty divorce when I was a preteen and a lot was put on me. My dad became verbally and emotionally abusive because I reminded him of my mom and his new wife didn’t like me. He started telling me I should eat less and I was fat among other things. Finally I just stopped eating. Now it has manifest itself as a psychological reaction to my anxiety and I find it hard to eat whenever my anxiety gets bad. 


It just recently came back and I’m struggling again, so I just joined this group to have an outlet."

harrypotter,epn30mp,t3_bv63vp,1559320514.0,"I also think this would be a good HBO series. In all of the descriptions of the First Wizarding War with Voldemort, it’s described as such a dark time and HBO could do a really good job with that. I think David Tenant and Ralph Fiennes are too old for the roles, though. Ralph could probably pull it off but Barty Crouch Jr. is described as so young, I think someone else would need to take on the role. I would also like to see a bit of a young Snape’s involvement in the war in this series. See the truly dark side of Snape before Lilly is killed and he switches sides. I think it’s an interesting take to make Daniel Radcliffe play James. I don’t hate the idea, but I doubt he’d take the role."
