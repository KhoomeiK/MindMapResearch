Be more specific 


Then my last posts go out the window my mistake.


In Georgia there are only three exclusion of self defense.
What seem to apply here to either of them is in this case is

Who was the initial aggressor, and how they would define aggressor.
Some people might say it started when he went to grab the gun, others might say they approached him with guns.
So it would ultimately be up to whoever defines “initial aggressor” in that specific case

And again, since the home was under construction, how they would asses the homes condition in order to define forcible entry.

And the source comes from a law firm called

husseinandwebber a law firm a friend of mine has contact with.

EIDT: The two men admitted to not seeing Arbury at the scene of the crime.
That’s really all you need to close this case, they’ll lose by just that statement"
pics,fqax618,t1_fqav2ce,1589226815.0,"Actually, you don’t sign away your rights if you’re not on the property and fleeing.
Under Florida law self defense is DENIED if pursuing someone that has committed a forcible felony

Because his property and self was no longer under imminent danger 

That was only until he chose to follow him, and had no right to do so with a deadly weapon because he was FLEEING.

Further more, the objective standard that Florida states of what a regular person would does these two men no favors.

The moment the two men in the truck chose to follow this man with weapons intended to be used with deadly  force, was the moment they were no longer covered by self defense law.

Some states have very similar laws, and an officer told me something very similar to this.

Idk what laws Florida has with houses under construction, but some states have laws require you to have a door in your entry way, or a barrier with  something that requires actual force to get in, in order for it to be forcible entry/burglary or what have you."
